<text>Robert D. McEwen (born January 12, 1950) is an American lobbyist and former Republican Party politician. He was a member of the United States House of Representatives from southern Ohio&#x27;s Sixth District, from January 3, 1981, to January 3, 1993. Tom Deimer of Cleveland&#x27;s &quot;Plain Dealer&quot; described him as a &quot;textbook Republican&quot; who is opposed to abortion, gun control and high taxes. In the House, he criticized government incompetence and charged corruption by the Democratic majority that ran the House in the 1980s. McEwen, who had easily won three terms in the Ohio House, was elected to Congress at the age of thirty to replace a retiring representative in 1980 and easily won re-election five times.

After a primary battle with another incumbent whose district was combined with his, McEwen narrowly lost the 1992 general election to Democrat Ted Strickland. Following a run in the adjacent second district in 1993, McEwen was largely absent from the Ohio political scene for a decade, until in 2005 when he sought the Republican nomination for Congress in the second district special election to replace Rob Portman, who beat him in 1993, and finished second to the winner in the general election, Jean Schmidt. McEwen&#x27;s 2005 platform was familiar from his past campaigns, advocating a pro-life stance, defending Second Amendment rights, and promising to limit taxes and government spending.

==Backgrounds==
Born in Hillsboro, Ohio, McEwen graduated from Hillsboro High School in 1968. He earned a Bachelor&#x27;s in Business Administration from the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida in 1972. He also attended Ohio State University&#x27;s College of Law for one year from 1972 to 1973.

McEwen and his wife, the former Elizabeth Boebinger, have four children. He is a member of many fraternal organizations and civic groups, including Sigma Chi, the Farm Bureau, the Grange, Rotary International, the Jaycees, and the Optimist Club.

After two years in his wife&#x27;s family real estate business, serving as a vice president of Boebinger, Inc., he was elected at the age of twenty-four to the Ohio House of Representatives in 1974 from the 72nd House District representing southern Ohio. McEwen&#x27;s district contained parts of Clinton, Fayette, Greene, and Highland Counties and all of Madison County. He was re-elected to two more two-year terms. In 1976, his plurality against Democrat L. James Matter was 14,816 votes, a number larger than the votes cast for Matter. (McEwen received 27,657 to Matter&#x27;s 12,841.) McEwen was a supporter of the state lottery in the House. Having previously directed Sixth District Congressman Bill Harsha&#x27;s re-election campaigns to Congress in 1976 and 1978, McEwen ran for Harsha&#x27;s seat when he retired in 1980. Harsha was neutral in the eight-man primary that McEwen won but supported McEwen in the general election where he defeated psychologist and minister Ted Strickland, Harsha&#x27;s opponent in 1976 and 1978, who went on to become Governor of Ohio.

==Congressional career==
In Congress, McEwen, who &quot;had a reputation as a man who thinks about politics every waking moment,&quot; claimed &quot;Congressional Quarterly&quot;, was a staunch conservative, advocating a strong military. In addition, he was a strong advocate for government works in his district — dams, roads, locks and the like much as Harsha had been — as McEwen was on the House&#x27;s Public Works and Transportation Committee. &quot;The Chillicothe Gazette&quot; would salute him for his work on funding for U.S. Route 35, a limited access highway linking Chillicothe to Dayton. In general, however, McEwen advocated reduced government spending.

A vehement anti-Communist, he visited Tbilisi in the former Soviet Republic of Georgia in 1991 to help tear down the hammer-and-sickle iconography of the Communist regime. That year he also called for the House to establish a select committee to investigate the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue – whether any soldiers declared &quot;missing in action&quot; in the Vietnam War and other American wars were still alive – by sponsoring H. Res. 207.

===McEwen&#x27;s district===
When McEwen was first elected in 1980, the Sixth District of Ohio consisted of Adams, Brown, Clinton, Fayette, Highland, Pickaway, Pike, Scioto, and Ross Counties plus Clermont County outside the city of Loveland, Harrison Township in Vinton County and the Warren County townships of Clearcreek, Deerfield, Hamilton, Harlan, Massie, Salem, and Wayne. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described the Sixth as &quot;a fail-safe Republican district.&quot; It had been in Republican hands since a 1959 special election.

The Ohio General Assembly redrew the Sixth District following the results of the 1980 Census. The boundaries from 1983 to 1987 included all of Adams, Clinton, Fayette, Highland, Hocking, Jackson, Pike, Ross, Scioto, Vinton and Warren Counties, plus Waterloo and York Townships in Athens County; Wayne Township in Clermont County; Concord, Jasper, Marion, Perry, Union, and Wayne Townships in Fayette County; and Washington Township and the Cities of Miamisburg and West Carrollton in Montgomery County.

Effective with the 100th Congress in 1987, adjustments were made by the legislature to the boundaries. A small part of the Montgomery County territory was detached, as were parts of Fayette County in Washington Court House in Union Township and the townships of Jasper and Marion. Part of Brown County was added, Jackson and Eagle Townships. These were the boundaries for the rest of McEwen&#x27;s service in Congress.

The district was largely rural and agricultural with no large cities. One of the major industries was the United States Department of Energy&#x27;s Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant at Piketon, which manufactured uranium for nuclear weapons. The district was 97% white with a median household income of $21,761.

===Tenure===
In a heated debate in 1985 over a Congressional seat in Indiana between Republican Richard D. McIntyre, whom the Indiana Secretary of State had certified as winning a seat in the 99th Congress, and Democrat Frank McCloskey, in which the House declined to seat McIntyre, McEwen declared on the House floor, &quot;Mr. Speaker, you know how to win votes the old fashioned way — you steal them.&quot; When McEwen was late in 1990 to the House because of a massive traffic jam on the I-495 beltway around Washington, D.C., he said on the House floor on February 21 that the District of Columbia&#x27;s government should be replaced:

The total incompetence of the D.C. government in Washington, DC, has become an embarrassment to our entire Nation. This experiment in home rule is a disaster. All of us who serve in this Chamber, well over 95% of us, have held other positions in government. We have been mayors. We have been township trustees, State legislators, and the rest. I am convinced, Mr. Speaker, that there are well over 2,000 township trustees in my congressional district who with one arm tied behind their backs, could blindfolded do a better job of directing this city than the city council of D.C. It is high time that this experiment in home rule that has proven to be a disaster for our nation be terminated, that we return to some sort of logical government whereby the rest of us can function in this city.

After McEwen was criticized for his remarks, he delivered a thirty-minute speech in the House on March 1, 1990, on &quot;The Worst City Government in America&quot;. Because of the crime problem in the District, McEwen also attempted to pass legislation overturning the District council&#x27;s ban on mace, saying people in the District should be able to defend themselves. During the Persian Gulf War in 1991, McEwen introduced legislation to end President Gerald Ford&#x27;s ban on U.S. government employees assassinating foreign leaders (Executive Order 12333) in order to clear the way for Saddam Hussein&#x27;s removal, McEwen objecting to the &quot;cocoon of protection that is placed around him because he holds the position that he holds as leader of his country.&quot;

===Considers Senate run===
In October 1987, encouraged by Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, McEwen announced he would challenge Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, a Democrat, in his 1988 bid for re-election, but McEwen found he lacked statewide support and would face a strong primary challenger in Cleveland mayor George V. Voinovich. He dropped out of the race in December. McEwen&#x27;s name was floated in 1991 as a possible challenger in 1992 to Ohio&#x27;s other senator, John Glenn, another Democrat, but McEwen did not enter the race.

===Easily reelected===
McEwen was easily re-elected to the House in every election but his last. In 1982, he defeated Lynn Alan Grimshaw, 92,135 to 63,435, and in the Reagan landslide of 1984 he beat Bob Smith nearly three-to-one, 150,101 to 52,727. In 1986 and 1988 he faced Gordon R. Roberts, defeating him two-to-one in 1986 (106,354 to 42,155 with independent Amos Seeley receiving a scattering) and three-to-one in 1988 (152,235 to 52,635). In the rematch, McEwen outspent Roberts twenty-to-one, $884,754 to $43,485. McEwen in 1990 beat his opponent, Raymond S. Mitchell — who the &quot;Dayton Daily News&quot; said &quot;is an unknown small businessman who hasn&#x27;t thought things through&quot; — by three to one. The tally was 117,200 to 47,415 in a race where Mitchell was outspent seventeen-to-one, McEwen spending $196,934 and Mitchell $11,171. Congressional Quarterly&#x27;s &quot;Politics in America&quot; pronounced him &quot;invincible&quot; in his district.

===In the spotlight in his last term===
McEwen served on the Public Works and Transportation and Veterans&#x27; Affairs Committees from his election to 1991. By 1989, he had risen to be the ranking minority member of the Public Works Committee&#x27;s Economic Development Subcommittee and was sixth in seniority on the full committee. During the 99th and 100th Congresses, he was also a member of the Select Committee on Intelligence. During his last term, in the 102nd Congress, he left Public Works and Veterans&#x27; Affairs for the powerful Rules Committee and served on its Legislative Process Subcommittee. He was chosen for the Rules Committee by Republican leader Bob Michel of Illinois, but McEwen would grumble that &quot;the Committee on Rules is stacked in a partisan manner 2 to 1 plus 1&quot; by the Democratic majority. During the 102nd Congress, he was also on the Select Committee on Children, Families, and Youth.

Late in his Congressional career, he began regular appearances on public affairs programs such as &quot;Nightline&quot; and the &quot;MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour&quot; and was often a guest on C-SPAN and the Cable News Network. Martin Gottlieb of the &quot;Dayton Daily News&quot;, a Democratic newspaper, thought McEwen&#x27;s performances showed why he had remained in the background previously:

In the past, McEwen&#x27;s ambition has taken the form of interest in higher office. Twice he made feints about seeking statewide office. But he didn&#x27;t want to risk his congressional seat. Now he&#x27;s found a way to nurse a healthy level of ambition without taking that risk. He has, of course, a pronounced tendency to be wrong about the issues . . . . Most typically, he appears as an ideological combatant. He seems to be selling himself to the nation&#x27;s conservatives as an attractive spokesman. He&#x27;s got enough talent to do it. In the days when McEwen was content to be a back-bencher, he was criticized on this page for his irrelevance on the important issues. Now, however, it is clear that the nation as a whole was better off when he was keeping his views to himself.

In his decade in Congress, McEwen compiled a conservative voting record, usually scoring in the single digits in the annual Americans for Democratic Action ratings and 85% or higher in the American Conservative Union&#x27;s similar polls, though McEwen was never one of the most conservative Republicans in the House nor the most conservative Republican in the Ohio delegation.

McEwen often joined his fellow Republicans in making special order speeches in the House, which occur after the business for the day has concluded and are made to a nearly empty chamber. McEwen&#x27;s ally Newt Gingrich of Georgia had discovered that, thanks to the C-SPAN cable network&#x27;s promise of &quot;gavel-to-gavel coverage&quot; of the House, he and his fellow conservatives such as McEwen, Mississippi&#x27;s Trent Lott, California&#x27;s Robert K. Dornan, and Pennsylvania&#x27;s Robert S. Walker could speak directly to Americans. &quot;Congressional Quarterly&quot; wrote viewers often found &quot;McEwen playing the trusty sidekick Sancho Panza to Bob Dornan of California, both tilting at the latest liberal windmill.&quot;

==1992 campaign==

===New district lines===
McEwen easily won re-election in every race save his last and was seen as unbeatable in his district. However, Ohio lost two seats in the 1990 reapportionment. The Democrats and Republicans in the Ohio General Assembly struck a deal to eliminate one Democratic and one Republican district, as one congressman from each party was expected to retire. The Republican expected to retire was Clarence E. Miller, a thirteen-term veteran called &quot;chairman of the caucus of the obscure&quot; for his invisibility on Capitol Hill. However, Miller surprised everyone by deciding to run for a fourteenth term. The Democrats in the Statehouse would not reconsider the deal and Miller&#x27;s Tenth District was obliterated.

The new district map was not agreed upon by the General Assembly until March 26, 1992, one week before the filing deadline for the primary originally scheduled for May 5. Governor George Voinovich signed the new map into law on March 27, and on April 1 the General Assembly moved the primary to June 2. Miller&#x27;s hometown of Lancaster was placed in freshman Dave Hobson&#x27;s Springfield-based Seventh District, but Miller chose to run in the Sixth District against McEwen since the largest piece of his old district — five counties — was placed in the new Sixth. Miller&#x27;s decision was also impacted by his strong personal distaste for McEwen.

After being hurt in a fall in his bathtub after slipping on a bar of soap, Miller was expected to withdraw and the Republican leadership hoped for a deal as late as May 15, the day Miller was to hold a press conference Ohio political observers thought he would use to announce his withdrawal. However, Miller stayed in the race and the two incumbents faced each other in the Republican primary on June 2, 1992.

===Miller and McEwen spar===
The primary race was bitter. Miller called McEwen &quot;Pinocchio,&quot; and McEwen said of Miller, &quot;His misrepresentations and falsehoods are gargantuan. I tried to be his best friend in the delegation. I am deeply disappointed at the meanness of his effort.&quot; Tom Deimer of Cleveland&#x27;s &quot;Plain Dealer&quot; wrote that the two candidates were largely identical on the issues: &quot;both are textbook Republican conservatives, opposed to abortion, gun control, high taxes, and costly government programs — unless located in their districts.&quot; Miller noted he had no overdrafts at the House bank, saying, &quot;the score is 166 to nothing.&quot; McEwen said &quot;every one of my checks was free and clear. Every month&#x27;s statement had a balance.&quot; McEwen ran commercials against Miller claiming the long-time congressman &quot;has fallen out of touch with Ohio&quot; and &quot;doesn&#x27;t live in our district and isn&#x27;t even registered to vote here.&quot; Miller struck back in a live-television interview by taking a Wheat Thin, claiming it to be McEwen, and then taking a bite out of it.

===Close results===
The 1992 primary was so close it forced a recount and prompted a lawsuit. When Ohio Secretary of State Bob Taft dismissed Miller&#x27;s charges of voting irregularities in Highland, Hocking and Warren counties, Miller filed suit in the Ohio Supreme Court. Miller dropped his court challenge in August and then only because his campaign treasury was exhausted. In the final count, McEwen won 33,219 votes to Miller&#x27;s 32,922, a plurality of 297 votes. In the end, McEwen&#x27;s geographic advantage (he retained 59% of his old territory) put him over the top. Ominously, however, Miller trounced him in the five counties that had been in Miller&#x27;s old district.

After the final result, Miller refused to endorse McEwen, though McEwen tried to soothe feelings by introducing H.R. 5727 in the House to name the dam and locks on the Ohio River near Gallipolis after Miller. Miller carried an unsuccessful legal challenge to the redistricting to the United States Supreme Court, insisting district lines should be drawn on a politically neutral basis.

===Defeated in the general election===
The old Sixth District was centered in southwestern and south-central Ohio around McEwen&#x27;s hometown, Hillsboro. After redistricting, McEwen found himself running in a huge area stretching from Lebanon to Marietta. This new district was very difficult to campaign in. It spilled across six media markets, meaning that McEwen had to buy ads in cities where most of the viewers couldn&#x27;t vote in the district. It also lacked any large cities and possessed few unifying elements. His Democratic opponent was psychologist Ted Strickland, whom he had defeated in his initial run in 1980.

Pat Buchanan, the conservative columnist who challenged President Bush in the 1992 presidential primaries, came to Ohio to campaign for McEwen, as did Vice President Dan Quayle and Oliver North. Though George H. W. Bush won the district, McEwen was narrowly defeated by Strickland in the general election on November 3. While he won 55–45 in the area he once represented, McEwen did not win in any of the counties that had once been in Miller&#x27;s district, losing the unfamiliar territory 59-41. Strickland received 122,720 votes to McEwen&#x27;s 119,252, a plurality of only 3,468. &quot;I think McEwen&#x27;s loss was a case of bounced checks and some arrogance,&quot; said Alfred Tuchfarber, a political science professor at the University of Cincinnati who runs the Ohio Poll. &quot;He just had a certain personal arrogance about him that didn&#x27;t go down well in a poor district.&quot; Strickland said, &quot;I ran against Pat Robertson, Pat Buchanan, the National Rifle Association and Right-to-Life. They threw everything at me. I&#x27;m just so happy I beat back those guys. I think they&#x27;re so divisive.&quot;

==Run in the second district in 1993==
McEwen then sought election to the House in the Second District near Cincinnati, immediately west of his former district, and which contained some territory he represented in the 1980s. The election was to fill the vacancy caused by Willis D. Gradison&#x27;s resignation to become a lobbyist for the insurance industry on January 31, 1993, three months after his re-election. &quot;It&#x27;s important that we have an experienced person to fight for jobs for Southwest Ohio. We need to bring economic growth to our area,&quot; McEwen said. &quot;It&#x27;s important that we have someone who can hit the ground running, representing our values of economic growth and low taxes.&quot; Though a congressman does not need to live in the district he represents, McEwen put his home in Hillsboro up for sale and rented a home in Bethel in Clermont County.

In the Republican primary on March 16, McEwen faced trade lawyer Rob Portman, who had worked in the White House under President George H. W. Bush; real estate developer Jay Buchert, the president of the National Association of Home Builders; and several lesser known candidates: real estate appraiser Garland Eugene Crawford of Loveland; anti-abortion activist Ken Callis of the Cincinnati suburb of Wyoming; Robert W. Dorsey, a professor at the University of Cincinnati and township trustee in Hamilton County&#x27;s Anderson Township; and Ku Klux Klan leader Van Darrell Loman of Cheviot. Three other candidates filed and qualified but withdrew from the primary, former Madeira mayor Mary Anne Christie; Lebanon attorney Bruce Gudenkauf, a member of the Warren County Republican Party&#x27;s central committee; and Donnie Jones, city auditor in Norwood.

In February the press reported that, according to campaign finance filings, McEwen trailed both Buchert and Portman in funds, Buchert having three times the treasury McEwen did. McEwen was endorsed by Oliver North, whose prosecution in the Iran-Contra Affair McEwen had labeled a &quot;political witch hunt&quot; when he was in Congress. McEwen also criticized Portman for lobbying Congress to pass the tax increase President George H. W. Bush supported when Portman was a White House aide. He also criticized Portman for being a lobbyist for Oman. McEwen brought his former House colleague Jack Kemp to Ohio to campaign for him.

McEwen faced questions about the bounced checks he had written on the House bank. Buchert ran campaign commercials citing McEwen&#x27;s checks, the expenses of his Congressional office, and his campaign finance disclosures, while noting Portman was &quot;the handpicked choice of the downtown money crowd&quot; and was &quot;a registered foreign agent for the biggest Democrat lobbying firm in Washington,&quot; labeling Portman and McEwen &quot;Prince Rob and Bouncing Bob.&quot; McEwen, who had taken a hard-line on his checks in 1992, relented in the campaign. Martin Gottlieb wrote, &quot;McEwen says now that his problem was a form of excessive pride. He says he used to &#x27;demand perfection&#x27; of himself.&quot; McEwen also said, &quot;I felt I could never admit a mistake. . . . I am very, very sorry. I should have watched it more carefully. . . . I have learned a great deal.&quot; Les Spaeth, chairman of the Warren County Republican Party and former Warren County Auditor, said, &quot;People very much disliked the check overdraft thing, but I think they don&#x27;t see it as happening again. I think it&#x27;s past. He made a mistake and he got caught. But that&#x27;s overridden by the service he&#x27;s given, particularly to our county.&quot;

After his successor in Congress, Ted Strickland, found election-related files on his office computers, questions were raised about whether McEwen had been illegally using his House office in his re-election campaign in 1992. McEwen&#x27;s former chief of staff said McEwen knew nothing about it, and the chief of staff admitted &quot;a technical violation of the rules.&quot;

McEwen won four of the five counties in the district — Adams, Brown, Clermont and Warren. In Adams, once part of his district, he received 77% of the vote, sixty-seven points ahead of Portman. However, McEwen finished third in the largest county in the district, Hamilton, one he had never represented and which contained 57% of the Second District&#x27;s registered voters. In the primary, Portman won only Hamilton County, but by a large enough margin to win the primary with 17,531 votes (35.61%), while McEwen received 14,542 (29.54%), Buchert 12,488 (25.37%), Dorsey 2,947 (5.99%), the rest scattering. The race in the Second District, one of the most Republican in the country, was determined in the primary — six times as many Republicans as Democrats voted in the primary — and Portman easily defeated attorney Lee Hornberger 53,020 (70.1%) to 22,652 (29.1%) in the special election on May 4.

Following the primary, the &quot;Dayton Daily News&quot; criticized McEwen for having voters return absentee voter request forms to his campaign office rather than directly to the county boards of elections. The &quot;Daily News&quot; also said the &quot;primary was completely about personalities, rather than issues.&quot;

==Returns to private life==
After his defeat, McEwen remained active in politics, but press accounts said he spent most of his time in the Washington, D.C., area residing in northern Virginia. Since 1997, he has been a partner with eleven other former Members of Congress in the Washington firm Advantage Associates, a lobbying and consulting firm. He founded FreedomQuest International, an international investment banking firm based in Washington, D.C. McEwen took to the lecture circuit, delivering speeches for $10,000 apiece. During the 2004 presidential election, McEwen traveled widely to speak for George W. Bush, focusing on Ohio. In 2006, he joined the law firm of Greenebaum, Doll, and McDonald as a consultant in its Cincinnati and Washington offices.

As executive director of the Council for National Policy, McEwen was embroiled in controversy over inaction of alerting the Ohio Republican Party about Wes Goodman&#x27;s sexual activities in 2015 before Goodman ran for office of the Ohio House of Representatives. Goodman resigned from his seat in November 2017 when allegations were made public.

==2005 congressional run==
 Days after President George W. Bush nominated Second District Congressman Rob Portman to be United States Trade Representative in March 2005, McEwen announced he would run for Portman&#x27;s seat. He then moved from his home in Fairfax Station, Virginia and purchased a second residence, a condominium in Hamilton County&#x27;s Anderson Township, east of Cincinnati. McEwen drew upon his connections and quickly had high-profile endorsements from Focus on the Family leader James Dobson, former United States Attorney General Edwin Meese, Cincinnati Bengals player Anthony Muñoz, American Family Association president Donald Wildmon, Citizens for Community Values anti-pornography crusader Phil Burress, and former New York congressman Jack Kemp, who came to the district to campaign for him. Kemp said in a rally in Clermont County on May 20 that &quot;Bob and his wife Liz are like part of our family.&quot; Dobson wrote in his endorsement letter, &quot;I have rarely been more excited about a candidate running in a highly significant race than I am about Bob McEwen for Congress . . . . If Bob returns to the House of Representatives, he will once again emerge as a tireless champion for the family and for traditional conservative values.&quot;

Ed Meese came to Cincinnati on May 31 to campaign for McEwen saying &quot;Ronald Reagan relied on him heavily.&quot; Rival candidate Pat DeWine, a Hamilton County Commissioner and the son of Senator Mike DeWine, the same day questioned McEwen&#x27;s post-Congressional career as a lobbyist, issuing a press release saying &quot;no one who has ever served in Congress ought to be allowed to become a lobbyist. Ever.&quot; Congressman John Boehner, whose Eighth District was to the west of the Second, endorsed McEwen on June 7. Boehner was a freshman in McEwen&#x27;s final term. He said, &quot;Bob is the most qualified to step in and represent that district.&quot; The Congressmen from other neighboring districts, Steve Chabot and Mike Turner, were silent in the primary race. McEwen a week before the primary was reported to have raised $366,429, McEwen donating $250,000 to his campaign; DeWine&#x27;s total was $743,407.

DeWine focused his attention on the most experienced candidate, McEwen. DeWine attacked McEwen with charges used against him in his last two campaigns. Dewine charged McEwen had &quot;wasted taxpayers&#x27; money&quot; by having the most expensive Congressional office of any Ohio member of the U.S. House and criticized McEwen&#x27;s bouncing of 166 checks on the House bank. DeWine also tried to depict McEwen as a carpetbagger, asking in television advertisements &quot;If Bob McEwen really cares about us, why has he spent the last twelve years living in Virginia?&quot; McEwen denied he had bounced any checks, repeating what he had claimed in 1992 and insisted that he had continued to reside in Ohio since he lost his re-election bid, noting he had never voted in Virginia nor held a Virginia drivers license. (McEwen did not live in the second district until April 11, when he bought a condominium in Anderson Township; but DeWine did not live in the district until he bought a home there on April 6.) DeWine quoted correspondence from the Highland County Board of Elections claiming the Board had cancelled McEwen&#x27;s voter registration for living in Virginia.

DeWine also questioned McEwen&#x27;s record on taxes, sending out mailings criticizing McEwen&#x27;s vote on May 24, 1982, in the 97th Congress &quot;in support of a Democrat budget that raised out taxes by $233 billion.&quot; Two mailings focused on this issue, one featuring a photograph of Ronald Reagan that was captioned &quot;When President Reagan Needed Votes to Keep Taxes Low, Bob McEwen Said &#x27;NO&#x27;&quot;, the other asking &quot;Are We Still the Party of Lower Taxes?&quot;

Jean Schmidt, a former member of the Ohio House, benefited from the conservative vote being split by McEwen and Tom Brinkman. The official returns showed Schmidt had won with 14,331 votes (31%). McEwen finished second with 11,663 (25%), Brinkman was third with 9,320 (20%), and DeWine, who spent $1 million on his campaign, finished a distant fourth with 5,467 (12%). The remaining vote was split by the seven others, none of whom received more than 5%. Following the primary, McEwen campaigned with Schmidt in the general election against the Democratic nominee, attorney Paul Hackett.

==Facing Schmidt in 2006==

On October 12, 2005, the Internet domain name BobMcEwenForSenate.com was registered. McEwen also considered a campaign for Lieutenant Governor as the running mate of Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell, who sought to replace Bob Taft as governor. On December 16, 2005, &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; reported McEwen was considering challenging Schmidt for her congressional seat in 2006 and had formed an exploratory committee. &quot;I am in serious consideration,&quot; he told the newspaper. On January 18, 2006, McEwen confirmed that he would run in the May 2 primary against Jean Schmidt.
He started his campaign with little in the way of reserve cash. &quot;I won&#x27;t let this distract me from my duties as a congresswoman,&quot; Schmidt told &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; upon McEwen&#x27;s announcement. &quot;I have a job to do. I can&#x27;t worry about this.&quot; Anti-pornography activist Phil Burress told the Associated Press that a race between Schmidt and McEwen would be tough. &quot;They are two totally different types of personalities. Bob is a statesman, and I love that. Jean will get in your face in a heartbeat, and I like that too,&quot; said Burress. Also running were Deborah A. Kraus, who worked for the West Clermont school district&#x27;s computer services department, and James E. Constable, who ran to protest the care his disabled son received from a state hospital.

McEwen finished second to Schmidt in the May 2 primary. Unofficial returns gave her 33,314 votes (47.75%) to McEwen&#x27;s 29,611 (42.45%), Kraus&#x27;s 4,358 (6.25%), and Constable&#x27;s 2,480 (3.55%). McEwen won Adams, Brown, Pike, and Scioto counties while Schmidt won Clermont, Hamilton, and Warren.

==Lobbying==
Following his primary challenge to Schmidt, McEwen worked as a lobbyist for Côte d&#x27;Ivoire strongman Laurent Gbagbo. &quot;In December [2010], McEwen was hired at a rate of $25,000 per month to assist the Ivorian ambassador to the U.S. &#x27;in exerting his influence in the most strategic way possible,&#x27; according to lobbying records.&quot; When asked about his representation of Gbagbo, McEwen said: &quot;I was a member of the intelligence committee. There are not too many places in Africa I haven&#x27;t been. So I&#x27;m knowledgeable of the issue and what&#x27;s going on.&quot; &quot;Despite allegations of human rights abuses, McEwen still supports Gbagbo, calling the 2010 crisis &#x27;a coup in progress&#x27; by Gbagbo&#x27;s opponents. He believes the international response is driven by French financial interests in the country.&quot;

==Namesake==
There is a water treatment plant in Clermont County&#x27;s Batavia Township named for McEwen. Clermont County was grateful to McEwen because he successfully forced the Ohio Department of Natural Resources to sell the county water from Harsha Lake after the state denied them water for years; the plant treats the Harsha Lake water he obtained for the county.

<doc id="883776" wikidata="Q5354472" url="?curid=883776" title="Stickball">
<text>Stickball is a street game similar to baseball, usually formed as a pick-up game played in large cities in the Northeastern United States, especially New York City and Philadelphia. The equipment consists of a broom handle and a rubber ball, typically a spaldeen, pensy pinky, high bouncer or tennis ball. The rules come from baseball and are modified to fit the situation. For example, a manhole cover may be used as a base, or buildings for foul lines. The game is a variation of stick and ball games dating back to at least the 1750s. This game was widely popular among youths during the 20th century until the 1980s.

==Variants==
In fungo, the batter tosses the ball into the air and hits it on the way down or after one or more bounces. Another variant is Vitilla, a popular variation of stickball played primarily in the Dominican Republic and areas in the United States with large Dominican populations.

== In popular culture ==

* In a scene from the 1976 movie &quot;Rocky&quot;, a group of youths play halfball (a variant of stickball) on the streets of Philadelphia. In the 1979 sequel &quot;Rocky II&quot;, the main character himself plays stickball/halfball in one scene. 
* The season 4 episode, &quot;Lisa&#x27;s First Word&quot;, of the animated series &quot;The Simpsons&quot; has a scene taking place in the Lower East Side of Springfield (visualized like a typical 1930s urban New York City neighborhood) where a boy asks his friends if they want to play stickball and they agree; instead of actually playing stickball, the group of kids head over to an arcade and play a video game of the sport.
* In the song &quot;I&#x27;m The Man&quot; by Anthrax, Scott Ian is said to like playing stickball.
* &quot;White Collar&quot; TV series (Episode 2.02 - &quot;Need To Know&quot;) protagonist Neil Coffrey comes up with a clever plan to create a park in honor of the fictional boy Timmy Nolan, who loved to play stickball.

<doc id="883786" wikidata="Q1618095" url="?curid=883786" title="The Dark Is Rising Sequence">
<text>The Dark Is Rising Sequence is a series of five contemporary fantasy novels for older children and young adults that were written by the British author Susan Cooper and published from 1965 to 1977. The first book in the series, &quot;Over Sea, Under Stone&quot;, was originally conceived as a stand-alone novel, and the sequence gets its name from the second novel in the series, &quot;The Dark Is Rising&quot;. &quot;The Dark Is Rising Sequence&quot; is used as an overarching title in several omnibus, boxed-set, and coordinated editions; but the title of &quot;The Dark Is Rising&quot; is also used for the whole series.

The books depict a struggle between forces of good and evil called &quot;The Light&quot; and &quot;The Dark&quot;, and draw upon Arthurian legends, Celtic mythology, Norse mythology and English folklore. The books were also influenced by Cooper&#x27;s reading of Robert Graves&#x27; study of mythology, &quot;The White Goddess&quot;. Both magical and ordinary children are prominent throughout the series. It was inaugurated in 1965 with the U.K. publication by Jonathan Cape of &quot;Over Sea, Under Stone&quot;. The sequels were published 1973 to 1977, almost simultaneously in the U.K. and the U.S. Volume four, &quot;The Grey King&quot; (1975), won both the Newbery Medal, recognizing the year&#x27;s &quot;most distinguished contribution to American literature for children&quot;, and the inaugural Tir na n-Og Award for English-language books with Welsh background. The concluding &quot;Silver on the Tree&quot; (1977) also won the annual Tir na n-Og Award.

The novel &quot;The Dark Is Rising&quot; features Will Stanton, age 11, who learns on that birthday that he is one of an ancient magical people called &quot;Old Ones&quot;, and is destined to wield the powers of The Light in the ancient struggle with The Dark. In the U.S. it was a Newbery Honor Book (runner up for the medal). Its 2007 film adaptation, titled &quot;The Seeker&quot; in America and &quot;The Dark Is Rising&quot; in Britain, made significant plot and character divergences from the book.

==Characters==
Simon, Jane, and Barnabas Drew: The main characters of the first novel, the Drew family, are human children who have known Merriman Lyon as their &quot;Great Uncle Merry&quot; for years. While on a holiday in Cornwall, they get caught up in the battle between the Light and the Dark and join the search for the Things of Power. In the first novel, &quot;Over Sea, Under Stone&quot;, they search for the legendary Grail of King Arthur. They also appear in the third book, &quot;Greenwitch&quot;, and the last book in the series, &quot;Silver on the Tree&quot;. In the poem featured prominently throughout &quot;The Dark Is Rising&quot;, they are the ones referred to as &quot;three from the track&quot;. Their surname is linked with Will Stanton&#x27;s in British paleohistory; see Stanton Drew stone circles.
* Simon Drew: Simon is the eldest of the Drews. In &quot;Over Sea, Under Stone&quot;, Simon and Barney are the two to go into the cave and retrieve the Grail. In &quot;Greenwitch&quot;, he is jealous of Will because Merriman brought him to Cornwall for &quot;unnecessary&quot; reasons, but eventually warms to him. He loves sailing and anything to do with ships.
* Jane Drew: Jane is the middle Drew. In &quot;Greenwitch&quot;, Jane is allowed to attend the Greenwitch ceremony, which is traditionally for female locals only, and through her compassion develops a special bond with the entity which constitutes the magical aspect of the Greenwitch. She subsequently receives from the entity the case containing the coded manuscript for deciphering the runes on the Grail. She also develops a special bond with the Lady of the Light in &quot;Silver on the Tree&quot;.
* Barnabas (Barney) Drew: Barney is the youngest of the Drews. He loves Arthurian legends and, although he is quite wary of his talent at first, paints. In &quot;Greenwitch&quot;, Barney sketches a picture of the bay, which is later stolen by an agent of the Dark, but Merriman recovers it and presents it to Tethys as a gift.

Old Ones: Ancient and immortal, the Old Ones are mystical beings who possess great magical power. They are found in all parts of the world and are of many races and cultures. Capable of performing seemingly impossible feats, including freezing time and controlling the elements, they serve the Light in the war against the Dark. The Great Lords of the Dark have many similar characteristics and abilities but are not Old Ones. The two factions struggle to determine the destiny of mankind; while the Light fights for freedom and free will, the Dark fights for chaos, confusion and the subversion of man&#x27;s agency.

Will Stanton: The main character of the second novel, and a major character in the remaining novels of the series, he is the seventh son of a seventh son, in a large, close human family. His eleventh birthday marks the beginning of his magical awakening and rise to power as the last of the Old Ones. &quot;The Dark Is Rising&quot; tells how he came to power, met Merriman Lyon, and accumulated the six &quot;signs&quot; to help fight the Dark. Will is the last of the Old Ones; no others will be born after him. In &quot;Greenwitch&quot;, he is invited to come to Cornwall by Merriman in order to help recover the Grail and cypher that reveals how to read the runes on the Grail. He later gives Jane a bracelet of gold engraved with the words &quot;power from the Greenwitch&quot;, which she throws into the sea as an offering to the Greenwitch in appreciation for its help. In &quot;The Grey King&quot;, Will goes to Wales to recover from sickness, where he meets Bran and awakens the Sleepers. In &quot;Silver on the Tree&quot;, Will travels with Bran to the Lost Land to recover the crystal sword Eirias, and helps to vanquish the Dark. Will is the only Old One to remain on Earth afterward, and the only one of the Light&#x27;s allies who remembers the struggle against the Dark; in this, he is referred to as &quot;the watchman&quot;, staying behind to keep watch for any attempt by the Dark to return.

Cooper named Will after William Shakespeare.

Merriman Lyon: The first Old One, Lyon shares a special bond with Will Stanton, last of the line. A friend of the Drew family for over a generation, he helps and protects Barney, Jane, and Simon as they quest for the Grail. They occasionally refer to him as &quot;Great Uncle Merry&quot; or &quot;Gumerry&quot;. Throughout the series, Merriman is portrayed in numerous historical periods, but particularly as King Arthur&#x27;s chief adviser, the mythical Merlin; in &quot;Silver on the Tree,&quot; Arthur calls him &quot;Mer Lion&quot;, old English for &quot;my lion&quot;.

The Lady: The Lady is the most powerful of the Light, an Old One of seemingly greater strength than Merriman. Gentle, wise and enigmatic, she is a pivotal figure throughout the series, appearing usually at important moments to turn the tide in the Light&#x27;s favour. She is an especial friend and mentor to Will and Jane. At one point in &quot;The Dark Is Rising&quot;, Will Stanton makes a critical mistake during a battle with the Dark and is saved by the Lady. Merriman tells Will that the Lady on her own is the only one of the Light able to overcome the full power of the Dark, although at a great cost. The sacrifice by the Lady is a critical point in the Story because she is a key element of the battle. At a later high ceremony of Old Ones, the Lady is missing and Merriman tells Will that her depleted power prevents her arrival, and she is beyond their magic to rescue but will return. She represents the Lady of the Lake, or the Lady of Avalon, King Arthur&#x27;s sister, as they both embark on Arthur&#x27;s boat &quot;Pridwen&quot; in &quot;Silver on the Tree&quot;. The Lady, like King Arthur, is affiliated with The Light and the High Magic. In &quot;Silver on the Tree&quot;, she initially can only communicate with Jane Drew, the one girl among the Six, telling Jane they share a special bond in being female, and calls her &quot;Jane, Jana, Juno&quot;, referring to Jana (in Roman mythology, a variant form of Diana) or Juno, the queen of the gods.

The Black Rider: One of the great Lords of the Dark, comparable to Merriman in power and influence. The Rider is the major nemesis of Will during his many trials. He patronises John Wayland Smith&#x27;s establishment, where he meets Will for the first time and attempts to bring him over to the Dark. He is given one name by the humans in the story: Mitothin (a name connected with the jötunn Loki, who helps bring about Ragnarok).

The White Rider: Another servant and Lord of the Dark, introduced in &quot;Silver on the Tree&quot;. The White Rider is almost equal in power to the Black Rider, and despite being feminine in her true form, often affects a masculine guise while attacking agents of the Light. She is revealed as disguising herself as Blodwen Rowlands, an &quot;aunt&quot; figure to Bran Davies. She acts kind and caring, to keep an eye on Bran while developing emotional bonds, while controlling events around Cader Idris, which means &quot;chair of Arthur&quot;, and the Sleepers. Will Stanton hypothesized that the monochromatic &#x27;colour&#x27; of the White Rider&#x27;s robes, like those of the Black Rider, reflected the &quot;extremism&quot; of their evil—either darkened by their ignorance, or blinded by the brightness of their ideas.

The Walker: A human who betrayed the Light and was cursed to carry the Sign of Bronze, one of six Things of Power that repel the Dark, through the centuries until the last Old One claimed it from him. The Walker was once Hawkin, a liege man and foster son of Merriman during the 13th century. His betrayal of the Light stemmed largely from Merriman&#x27;s acceptance of Hawkin&#x27;s willingness to sacrifice his life to protect the Book of Gramarye, the secrets of which the human Hawkin can neither possess nor partake of. In &quot;The Dark Is Rising,&quot; his appearance in Will Stanton&#x27;s town precipitates Will&#x27;s &quot;awakening&quot; and rise to power. He presents Will with his second sign.

The Sleepers: Ancient knights who served during the time of King Arthur. In &quot;The Grey King,&quot; they are awakened from a mystic slumber by the Harp of the Light, to ride against the Dark during the final battle in &quot;Silver on the Tree&quot;.

Pendragon: This is a reference to two characters. First, it is the figurative title referring to status as a leader, of several traditional Kings of the Britons, notably Arthur. It is also his son in this series, Bran Davies, who is predestined to wield the Crystal Sword of Light that is vital to the final conflict with the Dark. Bran Davies is brought forward in time by Merriman at the request of his mother, Guinevere, who feared that Arthur would reject Bran as a true son because of Guinevere&#x27;s affair with Lancelot. Bran is an albino, meaning he has very pale skin and white hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes, but his eyes are an unusual tawny colour. Will meets him in Wales during &quot;The Grey King&quot;, where they wake the Sleepers using the Harp. In &quot;Silver on the Tree&quot;, Bran and Will travel to the Lost Land and recover the sword Eirias.

The rooks: The majority of these birds are servants of the Dark and attract their forces wherever they are seen.

Farmer Dawson: An Old One who lives near Will Stanton and presents him with his first Sign.

John Wayland Smith: Another Old One who lives near Will Stanton; he is also a skilled smith. Though he is affiliated with the Light, he aids all who pass in his smithy. It is suggested that he might be Wayland the Smith of Germanic mythology.

==Artefacts==
Things of Power: The Old Ones have four Things of Power that will be used in the final battle which will allow them to defeat the Dark: the circle of Signs, the Grail, the Harp, and the Sword. They are obtained in &quot;The Dark Is Rising&quot;, &quot;Over Sea, Under Stone&quot;, &quot;The Grey King&quot;, and &quot;Silver on the Tree&quot;, respectively. &quot;Greenwitch&quot; is the story of the recovery of the stolen Grail.

*The Signs: A set of six circles quartered (divided evenly in four sections) by crosses. The six signs are each made of a different material and represent a different element: wood, bronze, iron, water, fire, and stone. The six Signs represent the Six champions of the Light, referred to in the recurring Poem of the Dark Is Rising series, as &quot;three from the Circle, three from the Track&quot;. The signs have the power to repel the Dark.
*The Grail: Made in imitation of the Holy Grail from the King Arthur legends, it is an artefact of power used by the Light. There are markings on it in a writing similar to Ogham, which is long lost. It is eventually translated by the Old Ones, thanks to a coded manuscript inside a metal case held by the Greenwitch.
*The Harp (the harp of gold): A golden harp that is obtained by Will Stanton and Bran Davies from a triumvirate of the High Magic by answering three riddles. The Light uses it in &quot;The Grey King&quot; in order to wake the Sleepers in preparation for the final battle. Whoever plays the harp creates powerful music that negates any magic, through the protection of the High Magic.
*The Crystal Sword: A magical sword, commissioned by the Light, crafted in the magical Lost Lands by the Lost King. It is named Eirias; therefore, &quot;blazing&quot;, also called sword of the sunrise. In the presence of the Dark, it burns with blue fire. It can cut portals through magical barriers, as seen in &quot;Silver on the Tree&quot;, and is encased in a magical scabbard of invisibility. It is used by Bran Davies, the Pendragon, heir of King Arthur, to cut the one fully blossomed silver flower on the Midsummer&#x27;s Tree, which is caught by Merriman.
The Book of Gramarye: The ancient &quot;Book of the Old Ones&quot;, it is an Old One&#x27;s rite of passage, while also teaching everything about their powers, and through it, they experience the magical spells. Gramarye, or grimoire, from the Old French word &quot;grammaire&quot; and the Old English word &quot;grammar&quot;, initially referred to all books, most written in Latin, which almost no one could read, and perceived by the masses as &quot;magical&quot;. The Book of Gramarye is protected by an enchanted device of a pendulum in a longcase clock, that if touched, will detonate and destroy any human that attempts to gain access to the book. This powerful book is further protected in that it is written in the Old Speech, which only an Old One can read and understand. It is blasted out of existence by Merriman after Will has read it.

The Doors: A set of carved oak doors that lead through Time. Old Ones can summon these doors to appear at will to transport themselves through time and space. The doors disappear when the Old Ones pass through them, accompanied by the haunting bell chime music of the Light. Their origin is not explained in the books.

Midsummer&#x27;s Tree: In the Chiltern Hills, England, The Tree produces a silver flower, which blooms once every 700 years, and is the final challenge for the Six of the Light. The person who obtains the silver flower gains control of the High Magic, to put out of Time the Dark or the Light forever. Bran Davies, the Pendragon and heir of King Arthur, wields the Crystal Sword to cut the fully blossomed silver flower on the Midsummer&#x27;s Tree, which is caught by Merriman, making the Light victorious.

==The Magics==
Old Magic: A powerful elemental magic, of which the Light and the Dark are the two opposite extremes.

Wild Magic: The magic of nature, first used in &quot;The Dark Is Rising&quot; to provide strength to the forces of the Light in the book&#x27;s final battle. In &quot;Greenwitch&quot;, we learn that the Wild Magic is equal in strength to both the Dark and the Light, but that it stands apart and is unaffected by either.

High Magic: The most powerful magic, being of the Cosmos. A spell of this type is used by the Old Ones in &quot;Greenwitch&quot; to be able to communicate with Tethys, the Queen of the Sea, and plead for her help in obtaining the scroll that will help translate the writing on the Grail. In &quot;The Grey King&quot;, Will Stanton and Bran Davies obtain the Harp of Gold from a place guarded by the High Magic after being tested by a Lord of the Dark, a Lord of the Light, and a Lord of the High Magic.

==Old Speech==
Old Speech is the spoken form of the ancient language of the Old Ones. When an Old One comes to power, this language is used instinctively by the Old One when speaking to members of the Light or the Dark. Will Stanton begins to do this without even realizing it. When an Old One speaks the Old Speech in front of a normal human, it will sound like gibberish.
Some agents of the Dark, such as the Rider, can also speak Old Speech, but with a distinctive accent which gives them away to the Old Ones.

==Rhymes==
Small rhyming prophecies serve to guide the protagonists throughout the series. Science fiction author and filker Julia Ecklar has set these rhyming prophecies to music, and the resulting song, also called &quot;The Dark Is Rising&quot;, won the 1997 Pegasus Award for Best Sorcery Song.

==Works in the series==
===&quot;Over Sea, Under Stone&quot;===
The characters in this book, which was published several years before the others, are younger than those in the rest of the series, and the issues are presented as less cosmic. Overall the book is aimed at younger readers more than the other four books in the series.

In this tale, Susan Cooper introduces the audience to Merriman, a pivotal character for the forces of the Light and also ties him with Simon, Jane and Barney Drew, three young mortal children, in a quest by the sea which will lead them over sea and under stone to find a grail of legend to help the Light in its struggle against the Dark.

===&quot;The Dark Is Rising&quot;===
The second book is set not on the Cornish coast but in rural Buckinghamshire, near the River Thames, and features a new group of characters. Will Stanton, the protagonist, begins to have strange experiences on his 11th birthday, just before Christmas. He learns he is one of the Old Ones, a guardian and warrior for the Light, and that he must help find the four Things of Power in order that the Light may battle the forces of the Dark. The first of these is the Circle of Six Signs, and the novel follows Will&#x27;s adventures as he finds each one of these mandalas, which are then joined into a completed circle and used to ward off the forces of the Dark. The book features elements of English folklore that are especially associated with the Thames Valley, with Herne the Hunter and Wayland the Smith making an appearance. Merriman/Merlin also makes an appearance, linking this book to the previous one.

&quot;The Dark Is Rising&quot; was an American Library Association Newbery Honor Book in 1974. Based on a 2007 online poll, the U.S. National Education Association listed it as one of &quot;Teachers&#x27; Top 100 Books for Children&quot;. In 2012 it was ranked number 22 among all-time children&#x27;s novels in a survey published by &quot;School Library Journal&quot;, a monthly with primarily U.S. audience.

===&quot;Greenwitch&quot;===

This story returns to the Cornish village, and unites the characters from the first two books. The chalice has been stolen from the museum, and the children must recover it.

Jane Drew witnesses the creation of a ritualistic offering known as the &#x27;Greenwitch&#x27;, and senses both great power and great sadness in it. She wishes that the Greenwitch could be happy, and that wish has important consequences later when it turns out that the Greenwitch possesses something that will unlock the secrets of the Grail.

===&quot;The Grey King&quot;===
In this book, Will is sent to the farm of some distant relatives to recuperate after an illness. Here in the Welsh hills he meets Bran, the Pendragon, son of King Arthur, and befriends him. He must also awaken the Sleepers to fight the Dark.

&quot;The Grey King&quot; was awarded the 1976 Newbery Medal.

===&quot;Silver on the Tree&quot;===

All of the main characters from the other books in the sequence come together in this book, some meeting for the first time, and the struggle between the Light and the Dark is resolved. After the Light wins the battle, Bran is offered a chance to rejoin his father, but chooses to give up his immortality to stay with his friends and his mortal adoptive father. All immortal characters except Will Stanton leave the Earth forever. All the mortal characters lose all memory of any dealings with magic and the Old Ones, though the Drews and Bran have snatches of something come back to them in dreams. Will is the Watchman, who will watch out for any attempts of the Dark to return.

==Locations==
Nearly all the locations mentioned in the books are based on real places. &quot;Over Sea, Under Stone&quot; and &quot;Greenwitch&quot; are set in Trewissick, which is based on a village in southern Cornwall called Mevagissey which Susan Cooper used to visit as a child. &quot;The Dark Is Rising&quot; is set in the part of Buckinghamshire where Cooper grew up: Huntercombe is based on the small village of Dorney, and the Manor is Dorney Court. The Welsh setting in &quot;The Grey King&quot; and &quot;Silver on the Tree&quot; is the area around Aberdyfi, the village where Cooper&#x27;s grandmother was born and where her parents lived.

== Critical reception ==
John Clute wrote in &quot;The Encyclopedia of Fantasy&quot; &quot;The overall tale evolves – not without occasional narrative confusion when time paradoxes and puzzles must be confronted – towards a guardedly affirmative climax in which it seems that the various young protagonists plus Bran Davies (King Arthur&#x27;s son) may succeed in staving off entropy and totalitarianism.&quot;

Karen Patricia Smith wrote &quot;Susan Cooper has come to be recognized as a major author of books for children and young adults. Her first work for children, &quot;Over Sea, Under Stone&quot; came as a response to a contest designed to honor the memory of E. Nesbit. Cooper&#x27;s major contribution to date has been &quot;The Dark Is Rising&quot; series, which greatly expands the mythical theme suggested in &quot;Over Sea, Under Stone&quot; and reveals Cooper&#x27;s extraordinary prowess as an author of fantasy... The shadowy aspect of the conflict and the inability to &#x27;read&#x27; clearly the motivations of some of the characters are areas in which Cooper has been criticized. However, I feel that the ambiguity of protagonists and antagonists is a deliberate literary device. Rather than succumbing to artistic flaw, Cooper goes beyond the conventional expectations of her readers by inviting them to glimpse the complex, the unexplainable, and often the threatening aspects of mankind&#x27;s nature. By offering the thesis that the human psyche may manifest itself in explicit actions or present itself in a mysterious and often frustrating manner, Cooper exceeds the traditional presentations of good versus evil often found in fantasy literature.&quot;

Mary Corran has written &quot;Cooper&#x27;s scholarly knowledge of legend, and skill in drawing together all the complexities of the five books into a triumphant finale, produce an epic of great power. There are differences in quality in the novels--&quot;Greenwitch&quot;...is perhaps the weakest, and &quot;The Dark Is Rising&quot; and &quot;The Grey King&quot; the strongest; &quot;Silver on the Tree&quot;, while suitably life-affirming in its conclusion, is slightly preachy, but that is a natural hazard of the subject matter. Cooper deals with the innate antagonism between mortals and immortals impressively, and in &quot;The Grey King&quot; reaches great heights as she mingles the worlds and peoples of legend and the present day. The sequence is a remarkable achievement, and Cooper&#x27;s gifts for description and characterization provide additional pleasure to novels already replete with intellectual enjoyment.&quot;

Joel Chaston writes &quot;Among Cooper&#x27;s books for children, the &quot;Dark Is Rising&quot; series is her masterwork. The five novels in it are rich with symbolism and poetic passages. &quot;The Dark Is Rising&quot;, perhaps the best single book of the series, certainly rivals and sometimes surpasses the work of the major fantasy writers--with whose work it is frequently compared.&quot;

Amelia A. Rutledge says that the series &quot;integrates the traditional lore of the British Isles with modern concerns. Her work, although commercially designated for a younger audience, exemplifies sophisticated mythopoeic writing not limited to that age group and is one of the major contributions to Arthurian fantasy of the 1970s.&quot;

Professor Michael D. C. Drout argues that Cooper makes greater &quot;use of Anglo-Saxon source materials&quot; than other critics have identified: &quot;Cooper&#x27;s uses of Anglo-Saxon sources are allusions that fit into a schema of history rather than (in the words of one reviewer) being merely tossed &quot;pell-mell&quot; into the mythical pot... It is Cooper&#x27;s Anglo-Saxonism, I argue, which generates the notions of British national identity explicated in the novels, notions that contradict the author&#x27;s overt political stance. In addition, Cooper&#x27;s particular version of Anglo-Saxonism, with its strong focus on teaching and learning, is isomorphic to the ideology of adult/child power relations represented in the novels, an ideology that puts great weight on the value of obedience to authority. Adult/child power relations are both replicated and reinforced by two other sets of opposed terms: British/non-British and supernatural/mundane, and all of these terms are finally subsumed in Cooper&#x27;s Manichaean binary, Light/Dark, leading to a closed symbolic economy which exalts personal obedience to authority and views Anglo-Saxons and their ideologies—as they were for the Venerable Bede in A.D. 771—as clearly on the side of the angels.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; wrote of the novel &quot;The Dark Is Rising&quot; &quot;This is a muscular fantasy... The writing is robust, but noticeably better out of human time than at the Stanton hearth: as if the author&#x27;s style, too, had experienced a salutary, magical translation... The fantastic style is virile and, for all its paraphernalia, spare. Susan Cooper&#x27;s vocabulary is athletic; the complications are dense. Her book seems to have been prepared for a special small age group: those who can read with fluency and attention, but who haven&#x27;t yet been afflicted by adolescent cynicism.&quot;

==Film adaptation==

Following the successful film adaptations of other fantasy classics, it was announced in 2005 that the novel &quot;The Dark Is Rising&quot; was being developed as a major motion picture. Called &quot;The Seeker&quot; in the US, the film was a joint venture between 20th Century Fox and Walden Media. John Hodge wrote the screenplay and the film was directed by David L. Cunningham and produced by Marc E. Platt. Ian McShane played the role of Merriman Lyon while Alexander Ludwig played the young Will Stanton as an American. Frances Conroy and Christopher Eccleston (as The Rider) also star. Filming began in February 2007 in Bucharest, Romania. The film was released on 5 October 2007, in the United States and the UK. It was not successful.

Screenwriter Hodge made substantial changes to the novel&#x27;s plot, tone, and characters. For example, to differentiate him from Harry Potter, the film version of Will Stanton is a 13- to 14-year-old American living in Britain. Hodge also felt that the &quot;lyrical, poetic, kaleidoscopic fashion&quot; of the book could not be filmed and felt compelled to add action for Will where &quot;he doesn&#x27;t actually do very much.&quot;

Cooper was disappointed by changes in the screenplay from the book and requested that some be undone. For example, she considered it crucial that Will is only 11 because that is before puberty. The film portrayed, and one of its trailers featured, Will as an adolescent teased for and preoccupied with his shyness and inexperience with girls.

<doc id="883793" wikidata="Q366285" url="?curid=883793" title="Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam">
<text>Jean-Marie-Mathias-Philippe-Auguste, comte de Villiers de l&#x27;Isle-Adam (7 November 1838 – 19 August 1889) was a French symbolist writer. His family called him Mathias while his friends called him Villiers; he would also use the name Auguste when publishing some of his books.

==Life==
Villiers de l&#x27;Isle-Adam was born in Saint-Brieuc, Brittany, to a distinguished aristocratic family. His parents, Marquis Joseph-Toussaint and Marie-Francoise (née Le Nepvou de Carfort) were not financially secure and were supported by Marie&#x27;s aunt, Mademoiselle de Kerinou. In attempt to gain wealth, Villiers de l&#x27;Isle-Adam&#x27;s father began an obsessive search for the lost treasure of the Knights of Malta, formerly known as the Knights Hospitaller, of which order Philippe Villiers de L&#x27;Isle-Adam, a family ancestor, was the 16th-century Grand Master. The treasure had reputedly been buried near Quintin during the French Revolution. Consequently, Marquis Joseph-Toussaint spent large sums of money buying and excavating land before selling unsuccessful sites at a loss.

The young Villiers&#x27; education was troubled—he attended over half a dozen different schools—yet from an early age his family were convinced he was an artistic genius, and as a child, he composed poetry and music. A significant event in his childhood years was the death of a young girl with whom Villiers had been in love, an event which would deeply influence his literary imagination.

Villiers made several trips to Paris in the late 1850s, where he became enamoured of artistic and theatrical life. In 1860, his aunt offered him enough money to allow him to live in the capital permanently. He had already acquired a reputation in literary circles for his inspired, alcohol-fuelled monologues. He frequented the Brasserie des Martyrs, where he met his idol Baudelaire, who encouraged him to read the works of Edgar Allan Poe. Poe and Baudelaire would become the biggest influences on Villiers&#x27; mature style; his first publication, however (at his own expense), was a book of verse, &quot;Premières Poésies&quot; (1859). It made little impression outside Villiers&#x27; own small band of admirers. Around this time, Villiers began living with Louise Dyonnet. The relationship and Dyonnet&#x27;s reputation scandalised his family; they forced him to undergo a retreat at Solesmes Abbey. Villiers would remain a devout, if highly unorthodox, Catholic for the rest of his life.

Villiers broke off his relationship with Dyonnet in 1864. He made several further attempts at securing a suitable bride, but all ended in failure. In 1867, he asked Théophile Gautier for the hand of his daughter, Estelle, but Gautier — who had turned his back on the bohemian world of his youth and would not let his child marry a writer with few prospects — turned him down. Villiers&#x27; own family also strongly disapproved of the match. His plans for marriage to an English heiress, Anna Eyre Powell, were equally unsuccessful. Villiers finally took to living with Marie Dantine, the illiterate widow of a Belgian coachman. In 1881, she gave birth to Villiers&#x27; son, Victor (nicknamed &quot;Totor&quot;).

An important event in Villiers&#x27; life was his meeting with Richard Wagner at Triebschen in 1869. Villiers read from the manuscript of his play &quot;La Révolte&quot; and the composer declared that the Frenchman was a &quot;true poet&quot;. Another trip to see Wagner the next year was cut short by the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, during which Villiers became a commander in the Garde Nationale. At first, he was impressed by the patriotic spirit of the Commune and wrote articles in support of it in the &quot;Tribun du peuple&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;Marius&quot;, but he soon became disillusioned with its revolutionary violence.

Villiers&#x27; aunt died in 1871, ending his financial support. Though Villiers had many admirers in literary circles (the most important being his close friend Stéphane Mallarmé), mainstream newspapers found his fiction too eccentric to be saleable, and few theatres would run his plays. Villiers was forced to take odd jobs to support his family: he gave boxing lessons and worked in a funeral parlour and was employed as an assistant to a mountebank. Another money-making scheme Villiers considered was reciting his poetry to a paying public in a cage full of tigers, but he never acted on the idea. According to his friend Léon Bloy, Villiers was so poor he had to write most of his novel &quot;L&#x27;Ève future&quot; lying on his belly on bare floorboards, because the bailiffs had taken all his furniture. His poverty only increased his sense of aristocratic pride.

In 1875, he attempted to sue a playwright he believed had insulted one of his ancestors, Maréchal Jean de Villiers de l&#x27;Isle-Adam. In 1881, Villiers stood unsuccessfully for parliament as a candidate for the Legitimist party. By the 1880s Villiers&#x27; fame began to grow, but not his finances. The publishers Calmann-Lévy accepted his &quot;Contes cruels&quot;, but the sum they offered Villiers was negligible. The volume did, however, come to the attention of Joris-Karl Huysmans, who praised Villiers&#x27;s work in his highly influential novel &quot;À rebours&quot;. By this time, Villiers was very ill with stomach cancer. On his deathbed, he finally married Marie Dantine, thus legitimising his beloved son &quot;Totor&quot;. He is buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery, though a planned tomb monument designed by Frédéric Brou was abandoned at the maquette stage.

==Writings==
Villiers&#x27; works, in the Romantic style, are often fantastic in plot and filled with mystery and horror. Important among them are the drama &quot;Axël&quot; (1890), the novel &quot;The Future Eve&quot; (1886), and the short-story collection &quot;Contes cruels&quot; (1883, tr. Sardonic Tales, 1927). &quot;Contes cruels&quot; is regarded as an important collection of horror stories, and the origin of the short story genre conte cruel. &quot;The Future Eve&quot; greatly helped to popularize the term &quot;android&quot; (&quot;Androïde&quot; in French, the character is named &quot;Andréide&quot;).

Villiers believed the imagination has within it much more beauty than reality itself, existing at a level in which nothing real could compare.

===Axël===

Villiers considered &quot;Axël&quot; to be his masterpiece, although critics preferred his fiction. He began work on the play around 1869, and had still not completed it when he died. It was first published posthumously in 1890. The work is heavily influenced by the Romantic theatre of Victor Hugo, as well as Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; and the music dramas of Richard Wagner.

The play&#x27;s most famous line is Axël&#x27;s &quot;Vivre? les serviteurs feront cela pour nous&quot; (&quot;Living? Our servants will do that for us&quot;). Edmund Wilson used the title &quot;Axel&#x27;s Castle&quot; for his study of early Modernist literature.

<doc id="883799" wikidata="Q1618062" url="?curid=883799" title="The Dark Is Rising">
<text>The Dark Is Rising is a 1973 children&#x27;s fantasy novel by Susan Cooper. The second in &quot;The Dark Is Rising Sequence&quot;, the book won a Newbery Honor. It has been described as a &quot;folkloric tale of an English boy caught in a battle between light and dark&quot;.

==Plot==
Will Stanton begins to have strange and magical experiences on his 11th birthday, which is at the winter solstice – a few days before Christmas. He discovers he is one of a group of an ancient magical people called the Old Ones, who are guardians and warriors for &quot;the Light&quot; (i.e. good), who are waging a centuries-long battle against the forces of &quot;the Dark&quot; (i.e. evil), whose evil power is rising. To fight back the Dark, the Old Ones need to find and reclaim four magical talismans (called &quot;Things of Power&quot;) for the Light. The first of these is the &quot;Circle of Signs&quot; (a set of magical objects in the form of circles divided into four sections by a cross). Will is quested to collect all the Signs, so that the completed Circle can be used to ward off the forces of the Dark.

This book introduces Will Stanton, a protagonist in &quot;The Dark Is Rising Sequence&quot;, and features elements of British folklore that are especially associated with the Thames Valley, with Herne the Hunter making an appearance.

==Reception, awards, and impact==
&quot;The Dark Is Rising&quot; was an American Library Association Newbery Honor Book in 1974. Based on a 2007 online poll, the U.S. National Education Association named it one of &quot;Teachers&#x27; Top 100 Books for Children&quot;. In 2012 it was ranked number 22 among all-time children&#x27;s novels in a survey published by &quot;School Library Journal&quot;, a monthly with primarily U.S. audience.

A film version, &quot;The Seeker&quot;, was released in 2007. Critical reception to the film was very poor.

The BBC ran a radio adaptation commencing in 2022, an adaptation with some use of more modern idiom.

<text>EPMD is an American hip hop duo from Brentwood, New York. The duo&#x27;s name is an acronym for &quot;Erick and Parrish Making Dollars&quot;, referring to its members: emcees Erick Sermon (&quot;E&quot; a.k.a. E Double) and Parrish Smith (&quot;PMD&quot; a.k.a. Parrish Mic Doc). During an interview on college radio station WHOV in 1987, Parrish Smith stated that the name evolved from the original: &quot;We were originally known as &quot;EEPMD&quot; (Easy Erick and Parrish the Microphone Doctor), but chose to go with EPMD because it was easier to say.&quot; He also stated that they dropped the two &quot;E&#x27;s&quot; because N.W.A.&#x27;s Eric Wright was already using &quot;Eazy-E&quot; as his stage name. The group has been active for years (minus two breakups in 1993 and 1999).

==History==

===Early years and mainstream success: 1987–1992===
Hailing from Brentwood, Long Island, New York, EPMD&#x27;s first album, &quot;Strictly Business&quot;, appeared in 1988 and featured the underground hit &quot;Strictly Business,&quot; which sampled Eric Clapton&#x27;s version of Bob Marley&#x27;s &quot;I Shot the Sheriff.&quot; Many critics cite this first album as the group&#x27;s most influential. The group&#x27;s brand of funk-fueled sample-heavy hip-hop proved to be a major force in the genre. Unlike old school hip hop, which was originally based on disco hits but eventually became more electronic, EPMD based its music mainly on lifting funk and rock breaks for samples and helped to popularize their usage, along with Marley Marl and Public Enemy. &quot;You&#x27;re a Customer&quot; combined snippets of Steve Miller&#x27;s &quot;Fly Like an Eagle,&quot; Kool &amp; the Gang&#x27;s &quot;Jungle Boogie, the bass line from ZZ Top&#x27;s &quot;Cheap Sunglasses&quot; and drum beat (Roger Linn LM-2 machine). &quot;Jane,&quot; about a romantic rendezvous gone bad, would be revisited on no less than five sequels; a first for hip-hop. &quot;You Gots to Chill&quot; used 1980s funk band Zapp&#x27;s &quot;More Bounce to the Ounce,&quot; which has become one of the most enduring sample sources for hip-hop. EPMD later appeared on the single &quot;Everybody (Get Up)&quot; by Zapp frontman Roger Troutman on his last solo album, &quot;Bridging The Gap&quot;, in 1991. &quot;I&#x27;m Housin&#x27;&quot; was covered some 12 years later by Rage Against the Machine. Managed early on by Russell Simmons&#x27; RUSH Management, the group toured with such hip-hop luminaries as Run-DMC, Public Enemy, and DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince.

EPMD signed with Fresh/Sleeping Bag Records, which eventually released its debut album, &quot;Strictly Business&quot;, by electro funk pioneer Kurtis Mantronik, who also worked as an A&amp;R representative for the label. Propelled by several strong singles (&quot;You Gots to Chill&quot; and the album&#x27;s title track), the album was eventually certified gold, selling over 500,000 copies, as did 1989&#x27;s follow-up, &quot;Unfinished Business&quot;. Financial frustrations followed when Sleeping Bag went under in 1992. The two EPMD albums and Nice &amp; Smooth&#x27;s debut album were acquired by Priority/EMI Records before the label was sold to Warlock Records. The duo&#x27;s Sleeping Bag contract was acquired by Def Jam. EPMD returned in 1990 with &quot;Business As Usual&quot; and &quot;Business Never Personal&quot; two years later. By 1992, the group presided over an extended family dubbed the Hit Squad, which included Redman, K-Solo, Das EFX, Hurricane G, and Knucklehedz.

In 1992, EPMD had a hit with its song &quot;Crossover,&quot; which lamented rappers making blatant concessions to pop sensibilities in order to get mainstream attention from music audiences. The song became a hit, peaking at No. 42 on the Billboard Hot 100 and in doing so becoming their biggest hit to date.

===First breakup and feud: 1993–1996===
EPMD called it quits in 1993, under controversial circumstances. According to interviews in &quot;The Source&quot; and &quot;Rap Pages&quot;, in late 1991, Smith&#x27;s house was burglarized by armed intruders. According to Smith, in the ensuing police investigation, one of the apprehended culprits supposedly gave up Sermon&#x27;s name as having allegedly paid them to do it. Sermon was arrested and briefly detained for questioning, but no charges were filed. Still, it led to lingering tensions, and by the time of the break-up, Sermon alleged financial impropriety on Smith&#x27;s part. The duo found itself as solo artists by default: Sermon debuted in 1993 with &quot;No Pressure&quot;, followed by &quot;Double or Nothing&quot; (1995), &quot;Def Squad Presents Erick Onasis&quot; (2000), &quot;Music&quot; (2001), and &quot;React&quot; (2002). Smith released 1994&#x27;s &quot;Shade Business&quot;, followed by &quot;Business is Business&quot; in 1996.

===First reunion and second breakup: 1997–2005===
The duo reunited in 1997, recording a comeback LP, &quot;Back in Business&quot;. In 1998, a remix of the song &quot;Strictly Business&quot; appeared by the A&amp;R man who signed the duo while at Fresh/Sleeping Bag, Kurtis Mantronik. Sermon released an album with Redman and Keith Murray as the Def Squad in 1998: &quot;El Niño&quot; was certified gold that same year. EPMD&#x27;s last LP, &quot;Out of Business&quot;, was released in 1999 as both a single CD and a limited edition double CD. The limited edition double CD contained both new material and rerecorded versions of its greatest hits. Smith released &quot;The Awakening&quot; (2003) on his own Hit Squad label, and Sermon released &quot;Chilltown, N.Y.&quot; (2004) on Motown/Universal. A Hit Squad compilation LP (overseen by Smith, featuring a new EPMD track) was released on Nervous Recordings in 2004.

===Second reunion: 2006–present===
A reunited EPMD with DJ Scratch performed live at the Rock the Bells Tour in New York on October 14, 2006, at &quot;B.B. King Blues Club &amp; Grill&quot;, their first NYC show in eight years. The tour also featured former Hit Squad members Keith Murray, Das EFX, and Redman.

Two months later, EPMD and Keith Murray released a new song, titled &quot;The Main Event,&quot; produced by DJ Knowhow. In the March 2007 issue of Swedish hip-hop magazine &quot;Quote&quot;, Erick Sermon and Parish Smith talked about whether the duo planned to record together again. On its recent tour, the group announced that it was working on a new album, tentatively titled &quot;We Mean Business&quot;.

On June 27, 2007, the group appeared on BET&#x27;s &quot;Rap City&quot; to freestyle. EPMD&#x27;s new single, &quot;Blow&quot;, was released on vinyl from Unique Distribution during August 2007 as a prelude to a new album that was to be released in 2008. The song instantly became a regular feature on the Funkmaster Flex show. The same month, the duo made a number of surprise live appearances, including the Rock the Bells tour with Rage Against the Machine, Wu-Tang Clan, Cypress Hill, Mos Def and others.

In June 2008, during an interview with HipHopGame, Erick and Parish confirmed that &quot;We Mean Business&quot; would be released on September 9. The album eventually emerged in December 2008, and featured guest appearances from the likes of KRS-One and Redman amongst others. In the end of the interview, they mentioned the possibility of a Hit Squad/Def Squad double disc album, but that they had problems with K-Solo.

On August 3, 2008, EPMD joined Method Man &amp; Redman on stage at the Rock the Bells concert at Jones Beach, New York.

The following month, EPMD took the stage as part of AllHipHop.com&#x27;s &quot;Breeding Ground&quot; event at S.O.B.&#x27;s in New York City. The duo performed many of their early hits and featured Keith Murray as a guest.

In March 2011, EPMD performed at the Lawyer4Musicians Hiphop showcase at Venue 222 in Austin, Texas. It was the duo&#x27;s first time performing in Austin, where they performed many of their early hits as well as cover songs and freestyle rhymes.

EPMD appeared on the Nas album &quot;King&#x27;s Disease II&quot; alongside Eminem on the track &quot;EPMD 2&quot;.

<doc id="883803" wikidata="Q1572544" url="?curid=883803" title="Rubus phoenicolasius">
<text>Rubus phoenicolasius (Japanese wineberry, wine raspberry, wineberry or [[dewberry]]) is an Asian species of raspberry (&quot;Rubus&quot; subgenus &quot;Idaeobatus&quot;) in the rose family, native to China, Japan, and Korea.

The species was introduced to Europe and North America as an ornamental plant and for its potential in breeding hybrid raspberries. It has subsequently escaped from cultivation and become naturalized in parts of Europe and North America.

== Characteristics ==

The species is a perennial plant which bears biennial stems (&quot;canes&quot;) from the perennial root system. In its first year, a new stem (&quot;primocane&quot;) grows vigorously to its full height of 1–3 m, unbranched, and bearing large pinnate leaves with three or five leaflets; normally it does not produce any flowers the first year. In its second year, the stem (&quot;floricane&quot;) does not grow taller, but produces several side shoots, which bear smaller leaves always with three leaflets; the leaves are white underneath.

The flowers are produced in late spring on short, very bristly racemes on the tips of these side shoots, each flower 6–10 mm diameter with five purplish red to pink petals and a bristly calyx. The fruit is orange or red, about 1 cm diameter, edible, produced in summer or early autumn; in botanical terminology and like all members of &quot;Rubus&quot;, it is not a berry at all but an aggregate fruit of numerous drupelets around a central core. Ripening occurs from early summer. The canes have red glandular hairs. These red hairs give the species its scientific name, from the Latin &quot;phoenicus&quot;, meaning red.

In addition to seed propagation, new plants are formed from the tips of existing canes touching the ground. They thrive in moist soil and grow near and within wooded areas.

As a fruit develops, it is surrounded by a protective calyx covered in hairs that exude tiny drops of sticky fluid. While the structure resembles those of carnivorous plants, the wineberry plant does not get nutrients from insects caught in the sap: the sticky mucilage contains no digestive enzymes, surrounding tissues cannot absorb nutrients, and there are no protein-storage tissues. Also, unlike carnivorous plants, wineberry grows in nutrient-rich soil, so it need not resort to insect proteins as a source of nitrogen.

The plant&#x27;s leaves and stems/branches are covered in spines. The leaves appear in sets of three, where the two side leaves are small, and the center leaf is large. The leaves are green on top, and white on the bottom because of a dense layer of woolly hairs.

== Cultivation and uses ==

Wineberries grow in the wild in many parts of the United States, primarily the Appalachian Mountains. They are common along the edges of fields and roadsides, and still are used as breeding stock for raspberry cultivars. They are edible, with no poisonous look-a-likes in North America. Other plants that may be mistaken as wineberries include red raspberry, salmonberry, black raspberry, and blackberry, all of which are edible. Sweet and tart with a raspberry-like flavor, wineberries are used similarly to raspberries to make pastries, such as pie or other sweet treats.

== Introduced status ==
The wineberry is native to eastern Asia and has been introduced into parts of North America and Europe. Wineberries grow vigorously and can form extensive, dense thickets that displace many native species. Wineberries can be found in many habitats, such as forest, fields, stream banks, and wetland edges, as well as open woods. The first years of growth for wineberries are longer (approximately 32%) than many other black and red raspberries. Wineberries are a host to several viruses, such as raspberry yellow spot that can affect native species of raspberry.

Wineberry vine growth may be controlled variously, such as by biological mechanisms increasing susceptibility to diseases, or mechanical effects by digging, excavating or repeatedly cutting back the plant until it dies. Concentrations mixed to the manufacturers specifications can be applied to the leaves to kill the plants. The wineberry is listed as a noxious weed by both Connecticut and New York where its possession and sale are prohibited by law.

<doc id="883804" wikidata="Q653699" url="?curid=883804" title="Opel Tigra">
<text>The Opel Tigra name has been applied to two different cars engineered and produced by the German automaker Opel, both based on different iterations of the Corsa supermini, the first built in Spain, the second in France. The first Tigra was a small 2+2 coupé, produced from 1994 to 2000. The later compact hard topped convertible roadster model was introduced in May 2004.

The Tigra was sold in the United Kingdom as the [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] Tigra, in Australia as the [[Holden]] Tigra, and was sold in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico as the [[Chevrolet]] Tigra.

==Tigra A (1994–2000)==



The first Tigra was based on the coupé concept car of the same name that was shown at the 1993 Frankfurt Motor Show, alongside an open top Tigra Roadster concept and the Scamp off roader/pickup. The première of the concept Tigra in the United Kingdom was in October 1993, at the London Motorfair.

The Tigra was built on the platform of the second generation Opel Corsa. The production vehicle was introduced in the beginning of 1994, and was built at Opel&#x27;s Zaragoza plant in Spain. Production commenced in September 1994. General Motors&#x27; Pontiac division had considered importing the Tigra to the United States, but in the end it was determined that the car was too small for American consumers. Television advertisements in the United Kingdom for the (Vauxhall) Tigra featured the tune &quot;Fiesta&quot; by The Pogues.

The Tigra shared no body panels with the Corsa on which it was based, and the interior layout was different, however still kept the Corsa dashboard and most major engine parts. The Tigra also included a 2+2 seating arrangement. Due to the coupé styling and compact dimensions of the car, rear seat space was limited. The design incorporated a lightning theme as per the Opel logo; this can be seen in the way the roof and waistlines meet the reverse rake of the B-pillar, while lightning-shaped reflection appears in the metal ahead of the rear wheelwell in certain lighting conditions.

The Tigra was available with two petrol engines options, both from the Ecotec family, an entry-level 1.4 L with , and a larger sportier version, powered by the 1.6 L engine with , sourced from the Corsa GSi and later Corsa Sports. Both were DOHC 16 valve engines with electronic fuel injection.

The smaller engine was available with an optional four-speed automatic gearbox. The 1.6-litre model came with front fog lights as standard, a feature unavailable on the 1.4-litre version. An automatic option for the 1.4 was added in February 1995.

The suspension was essentially unchanged from the Corsa donor model, although the setup had been tweaked by Lotus. However, the car carried extra weight, with over the equivalent engined Corsa models. 0–100 km/h acceleration on the 1.6 L model was 10.5 seconds, one second slower than the Corsa GSi. A higher top speed of was obtained thanks to the higher gear ratios, a lower drag coefficient of 0.31, and standard 15&quot; wheels on the more powerful model.

The car was imported by GM and sold as the Chevrolet Tigra in Brazil and Mexico, and as the Vauxhall Tigra in the United Kingdom. The Chevrolet Tigra was imported to Brazil only for a few months, between the end of 1998 to the beginning of 1999, due to a sudden depreciation of the real, which forced General Motors do Brasil to end importation. Only the 1.6 L model was imported, detuned to for tax purposes. The 15&quot; wheels were also exchanged for more affordable 14&quot; wheels.

Production ended in July 2000, with the final sale number worldwide being 256,392. In Germany, from 1994 to 2000, 59,462 models of the car were sold.

==Tigra TwinTop B (2004–2009)==


After an absence of four years, Opel resurrected the nameplate &quot;Tigra&quot; in June 2004, for a new sports car based on the third generation Opel Corsa. The Tigra TwinTop, as it was called in markets of Opel, was a two-seater coupé convertible with a retractable hardtop, in the fashion of the Peugeot 206 CC.

It was launched at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2004, and was produced by French coachbuilder Heuliez. Sales commenced in October 2004. Like its predecessor, the Tigra TwinTop was available with two petrol powered engines.

The base model used the 1.4 L engine with , from the Family 0, while the top of the range uses the Ecotec 1.8 L from the Corsa GSi, with . An economic version, which used Fiat&#x27;s Multijet 1.3 diesel engine, was introduced in 2005.

The second generation was marketed in Australia as the XC series Holden Tigra, only with the 1.8 L engine. Production ended in May 2009, with the final production number being 90,874.

<doc id="883805" wikidata="Q374377" url="?curid=883805" title="Ellen Langer">
<text>Ellen Jane Langer (; born March 25, 1947) is an American professor of psychology at Harvard University; in 1981, she became the first woman ever to be tenured in psychology at Harvard. She is widely known as the &quot;mother of mindfulness&quot; and the &quot;mother of positive psychology&quot;. Langer studies the illusion of control, decision-making, aging, and mindfulness theory. Her most influential work is &quot;Counterclockwise&quot;, published in 2009, the first test of her mind/body unity theory. Her most recent book, &quot;The Mindful Body: Thinking Our Way to Chronic Health&quot;, published in 2023, argues for the enormous control we have over our health based on mind/body unity.

==Early life and education==
Langer was born in The Bronx, New York. She received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in psychology from New York University, and her PhD in Social and Clinical Psychology from Yale University in 1974.

==Career==
Langer has had a significant influence on the positive psychology movement. Along with being known as the mother of positive psychology, her contributions to the study of mindfulness have earned her the moniker of the &quot;mother of mindfulness.&quot; Her work helped to presage mind/body medicine, which has been regarded by many scientists to be an important intellectual movement and one that now has &quot;considerable evidence that an array of mind-body therapies can be used as effective adjuncts to conventional medical treatment.&quot; She has co-authored experimental research indicating a connection between time perception and wound healing.

She has published over 200 articles and academic texts, was published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and discussed her works on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. Additionally, in many introductory psychology courses at universities across the United States, her studies are required reading.

Many regard Langer as a trailblazer who initiated a transformative shift in perspective. Daniel Gilbert, a psychology professor, stated in the 1989 anthology &quot;Unintended Thought&quot;, “[Langer] pointed out that social inference is not always a conscious and deliberate act; rather it is often the province of mindless automata.” He further noted, “This clarion call was widely appreciated, and if Langer did not quite set the stage for a psychology of unconscious social inference, she at least rented the theatre.”

===Aging===
Langer and colleagues have conducted multiple forms of research to promote the flexibility of aging. Some of her most impactful work has been her research on her famous Counterclockwise Study (1979). This study found that when elderly men were temporarily placed in a setting that recreated their past, their health improved, and they even looked younger. This study was originally published by Oxford University Press and later described in her best seller, &quot;Mindfulness&quot;. It is the basis of what is now called Reminiscence Therapy. The study was the basis of a British Academy of Film and Television Awards nominated BBC series, The Young Ones. The original study was published in a chapter of a book edited by Langer published by Oxford University Press. In 2018, the counterclockwise study was repeated in Italy, but the results have not been published as of 2024. Langer and colleagues have explored the theory of mind/body which the counterclockwise study is a part more broadly.

Other important work has shown that rewarding behaviors and following completion of memory tasks improves memory. Another study showed that among nursing home patients, simply taking care of a plant improves mental and physical health, as well as life expectancy. By having chambermaids call their everyday activity “exercise” rather than “labor,” Langer found that the chambermaids experienced a myriad of health benefits including: &quot;a decrease in their systolic blood pressure, weight, and waist-to-hip ratio.&quot;

===Mindfulness===
Langer is well known for her contributions to the study of mindfulness and of mindless behaviour, with these contributions having provided the basis for many studies focused on individual differences in unconscious behavior and decision-making processes in humans. Although she initially studied meditation as well, her larger contribution is to the study of mindfulness without meditation. Langerian research on mindfulness has been shown to Granger-cause or lead other research in mindfulness.

In 1989, she published &quot;Mindfulness&quot;, her first book, showing its widespread influence and application to business, education, science, art, and interpersonal relationships, and she is widely known as the &quot;mother of mindfulness&quot;. Langer defines mindfulness as &quot;the simple act of noticing new things.&quot; The Langer Mindfulness Scale aims to proxy for measures of this form of mindfulness. Langer says that mindfulness can help teach that &quot;uncertainty is the rule rather than the exception.&quot;

==Awards==
In 1980, she was the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship. Other honors include the Award for Distinguished Contributions to Psychology in the Public Interest of the American Psychological Association, the NYU Alumni Achievement Award, the Liberty Science Center Genius Award, the Distinguished Contributions of Basic Science to Applied Psychology award from the American Association of Applied and Preventive Psychology, the James McKeen Cattel Award, and the Gordon Allport Intergroup Relations Prize.

<doc id="883816" wikidata="Q675391" url="?curid=883816" title="Little Germany, Manhattan">
<text>Little Germany, known in German as &#x27; and &#x27; and called Dutchtown by contemporary non-Germans, was a German immigrant neighborhood on the Lower East Side and East Village neighborhoods of Manhattan in New York City. The demography of the neighborhood began to change in the late 19th century, as non-German immigrants settled in the area. A steady decline of Germans among the population was accelerated in 1904, when the &quot;General Slocum&quot; disaster decimated the social core of the population with the loss of more than 1,000 lives.

==Growth==

Beginning in the 1840s, large numbers of German immigrants entering the United States provided a constant population influx for Little Germany. In the 1850s alone, 800,000 Germans passed through New York. By 1855 New York had the third largest German population of any city in the world, outranked only by Berlin and Vienna. The German immigrants differed from others in that they usually were educated and had marketable skills in crafts. More than half of the era&#x27;s bakers and cabinet makers were Germans or of German origin, and many Germans also worked in the construction business. Educated Germans such as Joseph Wedemeyer, Oswald Ottendorfer and Friedrich Sorge were important players in the creation and growth of trade unions, and many Germans and their &quot;Vereine&quot; (German American clubs) were also often politically active. Oswald Ottendorfer who was the owner-editor of the &quot;Staats-Zeitung,&quot; New York&#x27;s largest German-language newspaper, was among the wealthiest and most socially prominent German-Americans in the city. He also became the undisputed leader of the newly important German Democracy, which would help Fernando Wood recapture the mayor&#x27;s office in 1861 and elect Godfrey Gunther as mayor in 1863.

At the time, Germans tended to cluster more than other immigrants, such as the Irish, and in fact those from particular German states preferred to live together. This choice of living in wards with those from the same region was perhaps the most distinct and overlooked feature of . For instance the Prussians, who by 1880 accounted for nearly one-third of the city&#x27;s German-born population, were most heavily concentrated in the city&#x27;s Tenth Ward. Germans from Hessen-Nassau tended to live in the Thirteenth Ward in the 1860s and in the ensuing decades moved northward to the borders of the Eleventh and Seventeenth Wards. Germans from Baden by the 1880s tended to favor living in the Thirteenth Ward, and Württembergers began by the 1860s to migrate northward into the Seventeenth Ward. The Bavarians (including Palatines from the Palatinate region of western Germany on the Rhine River, which was subject to the King of Bavaria), the largest group of German immigrants in the city by 1860, were distributed evenly in each German ward except the Prussian Tenth. Aside from the small group of Hanoverians, who had a strong sense of self-segregation forming their own &quot;Little Hanover&quot; in the Thirteenth Ward, the Bavarians displayed the strongest regional bias, mainly toward Prussians: at all times the most distinctive characteristic of their settlement pattern remained that they would be found wherever the Prussians were fewest.

In 1845, Little Germany was already the largest German-American neighborhood in New York; by 1855, its German population had more than quadrupled, displacing the American-born workers who had first moved into the neighborhood&#x27;s new housing, and at the beginning of the 20th century, it was home to almost 50,000 people. From a core in the riverside 11th Ward, it expanded to encompass most of the 10th, 13th, and 17th Wards, the same area that later became known as the Jewish Lower East Side. Tompkins Square Park, in what is now known as Alphabet City, was an important public space that the Germans called the &quot;Weisse Garten&quot;. There were beer gardens, sport clubs, libraries, choirs, shooting clubs, German theatres, German schools, German churches, and German synagogues. A large number of factories and small workshops operated in the neighborhood, initially in the interiors of blocks, reached by alleyways. There were major commercial streets including department stores. Stanley Nadel quotes a description of the neighborhood at its peak in the 1870s:

==&quot;General Slocum&quot; disaster==


On June 15, 1904, St Mark&#x27;s Evangelical Lutheran Church organized their 17th annual picnic to commemorate the end of the school year. A large paddlewheeler, the &quot;General Slocum&quot;, was chartered for a cruise on the East River to a picnic site on Long Island, and over 1,300 passengers, mostly women and children, participated in the event. Shortly after departing, a fire started in a storage compartment in the forward section. Although the ship was equipped with lifeboats and preservers, both were in disrepair. The inadequacy of the safety equipment, compounded with the poor leadership of Captain William Van Schaick, caused an estimated 1,021 passengers to die by fire or drowning.

Although only one percent of Little Germany&#x27;s population was killed by the disaster, those lost were members of the most established families, the social foundation of Little Germany&#x27;s community, and the extent of the disaster had enormous repercussions on the St Mark&#x27;s parish. The disaster as well as the accelerated exodus that was already well underway and the future anti-German sentiment that would occur during World War I would lead Kleindeutschland to extinction. Some bereaved parents, spouses, children, and friends committed suicide. To further complicate matters, the desire to find a culprit, conflicting public opinion, and family quarrels among survivors about the distribution of money from a relief fund led the culture of Little Germany to turn sour. The final indignity was the jury&#x27;s refusal to find Captain Van Schaick guilty of manslaughter; one of the only things he was ever punished for was lack of safety-preparedness, which was sufficient for him to receive a ten-year prison sentence.

==Decline==
The &quot;General Slocum&quot; disaster was perhaps the final blow in hastening the end of Little Germany, but for decades before that event, the neighborhood had been contracting in size, both in population and in area. Near the end of the 19th century, between 1870 and 1900, second-generation German-Americans began to leave the old neighborhood to resettle in Brooklyn, in particular in Williamsburg, and farther uptown on the East Side of Manhattan, in Yorkville. At the same time, the press of new mass immigration into the city of not only Germans – whose numbers peaked in the 1880s – and Irish, but also large numbers of Russian and Yiddish speaking Eastern European Jews and Italians from the south of that country caused Little Germany to contract, so that rather than taking up a large portion of the East Side below 23rd Street, it was eventually bounded by 14th Street on the north, Grand Street on the south, Broadway on the west, and the East River on the east. As well, the new mix of immigrants coming in changed the character of the area, so that what had been began to transform into the Lower East Side. The &quot;Slocum&quot; disaster accelerated the process, as in its wake, much of the remaining German population moved, to Yorkville and elsewhere.

<text>Emil Johann Rudolf Puhl (28 August 1889 in Berlin – 30 March 1962 in Hamburg) was a Nazi economist and banking official during World War II.

==Career==
A Nazi, Puhl was director and vice-president of Germany&#x27;s Reichsbank during World War II and also served as a director for the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) at Basel (Switzerland).

==Nazi gold==
He was instrumental in moving Nazi gold during the war. Some of the gold had been looted from countries occupied by the Nazis, and some also stolen from their victims incarcerated in Nazi concentration camps. Much came from the victims of Operation Reinhard at Auschwitz, Majdanek, Treblinka, Bełżec, Chełmno and Sobibór where mass murder involved mainly gassing the prisoners with Zyklon B or from engine fumes, the toxic component being carbon monoxide. All their property was removed before they passed into the &quot;showers&quot; (which were, in fact, gas chambers, where they died). Even after death, their corpses were carefully examined for any concealed items such as gold or jewelry as well as gold teeth, which had to be removed forcibly before being passed on to the Reichsbank.

==Nuremberg Trials==
At the Ministries Trial, one of the last of the twelve Nuremberg trials held between 6 January 1948 and 13 April 1949, he was convicted of war crimes and sentenced to five years&#x27; imprisonment. He was released from prison 21 December 1949, several months early due to good conduct.

<text>The Royal Canadian Regiment (RCR) is an infantry regiment of the Canadian Army. The regiment consists of four battalions, three in the Regular Force and one in the primary reserve. The RCR is ranked first in the order of precedence amongst Canadian Army infantry regiments, but in a quirk of the rules of seniority, its 4th battalion is ninth.

The RCR was originally authorized as the Infantry School Corps on 21 December 1883, and established its first three company stations at Fredericton, New Brunswick; St Jean, Quebec; and Toronto, Ontario. In 1887 a fourth company was authorized and the next year was established at London, Ontario. Now consisting of three Regular Force battalions and one Reserve Force battalion, the regiment&#x27;s four battalions are now stationed in Ontario and New Brunswick. With many of its soldiers drawn from Ontario and the Atlantic Provinces in recent decades, the regiment maintains a general connection as the &quot;local&quot; infantry regiment for anglophone eastern Canada.

The regiment is a &quot;British-style&quot; infantry regiment that is the spiritual home and repository of customs and traditions for a number of battalions that do not necessarily serve together operationally. The RCR maintains its Regimental Headquarters (RHQ) in Petawawa, Ontario, which has no operational command role but handles regimental affairs outside the responsibility of the individual battalions. The Royal Canadian Regiment Museum is located within historic Wolseley Hall in London, Ontario. Wolseley Barracks in London has been continuously occupied by some element of the regiment since construction of Wolseley Hall was completed in 1888. At various times Wolseley Barracks has been the home of the Regimental Headquarters, the 1st and 2nd Battalions, and remains the home of the 4th Battalion today.

== History ==
===Early history===
The Royal Canadian Regiment is one of Canada&#x27;s oldest Regular Force military units. In 2012 the regiment was assigned the perpetuation of the 1st Regiment of Middlesex Militia (1812–15) and the 1st Regiment of Oxford Militia (1812–15) from the War of 1812, and as a result carries three battle honours from that conflict. The RCR was also assigned the perpetuation of The Loyal London Volunteers which was accompanied by a non-emblazonable Honorary Distinction.

The regiment itself was formed as the Infantry School Corps on 21 December 1883, authorized by a Militia Act which also created the Cavalry School Corps. These school corps were created as regular units that would train the Canadian militia. The first companies stood up in Fredericton NB, St Jean-sur-Richelieu QC, and Toronto ON in 1883, with a fourth company standing up in London ON several years later.

The Infantry School Corps&#x27; first battle honours were earned during the North-West Rebellion in 1885, where it fought at Batoche and Cut Knife Creek. The regiment later provided personnel to the Yukon Field Force (1898–1900), which assisted the North-West Mounted Police in the Yukon during the Gold Rush. The regiment served in the South African (Boer) War (1899–1903). Its Great War deployment was delayed by a garrison assignment in Bermuda from September 1914 until August 1915. Upon returning to Nova Scotia, its members attested for overseas service with the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF), arriving in France in October 1915 to fight in WW1.

===South African War===
The regiment&#x27;s name was changed to The Royal Canadian Regiment of Infantry in 1893, with a new emphasis on being combat capable. William Dillon Otter, formerly of The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada, was the first Commanding Officer. He would later become the first Canadian-born Chief of the General Staff, the head of the Canadian Army.

During the South African War (Second Boer War), the &quot;2nd (Special Service) Battalion&quot; was raised from across the country to contribute Canada&#x27;s First Contingent in this war, with Otter in command. This battalion was quickly disbanded in 1900 upon its return to Canada, even though they were considered by many British officers to be the best infantry battalion in the country. The &quot;3rd (Special Service) Battalion&quot; was also raised at this time, in 1900, and was employed as a garrison force in Halifax until 1902 when it was also disbanded.

In the Boer War, the Toronto company of the 2RCRI fought Canada&#x27;s first overseas battle at Sunnyside, Cape Colony, on January 1, 1900, defeating a Boer commando in an action led by Australia&#x27;s Queensland Mounted Infantry. The unit as a whole then joined and played an instrumental role in the victory at the Battle of Paardeberg Drift (18–27 February 1900), including an advance by night towards the enemy lines, quietly digging trenches on high ground 65 yards from the Boer lines. On February 27, 1900, the Boers, staring into the muzzles of Canadian and British rifles, surrendered, thus removing the commando blocking the way to the first Boer capital, Bloemfontein, Orange Free State. This date has since been celebrated by the Regiment as Paardeberg Day. Having delivered the first unqualified good news of the war for the British Empire, the Regiment also distinguished itself on the march north, arriving first at the gates of Pretoria.

During the South African War Private Richard Rowland Thompson was awarded a Queen&#x27;s scarf, one of the four presented to soldiers of the Dominions, a further four scarves crocheted by Queen Victoria went to non-commissioned officers of the British Army.

A small statuette (1999) by André Gauthier (sculptor) commemorates the centennial of the Royal Canadian Regiment&#x27;s Battle of Paardeberg during the Boer War.

===End of the Victorian era and the Great War; 1900–1919===
In October 1901 the regiment received new colours from the Duke of Cornwall and York (later King George V) during his visit to Canada, and the regiment&#x27;s name was changed to The Royal Canadian Regiment. In 1914, the regiment was deployed to the Imperial fortress colony of Bermuda for garrison duties, replacing the 2nd Battalion, Lincolnshire Regiment, from September 1914 (arriving at Bermuda on 3 September, 1914, aboard HMCS Canada, escorted by HMCS Niobe) to August 1915, when it was replaced by the 38th Battalion (Ottawa), CEF and returned to Halifax and reattested for overseas service. The RCR arrived in France in October 1915 to join the new 3rd Canadian Division. The regiment combined with Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry and the 42nd and 49th Canadian Infantry Battalions to form the 7th Canadian Infantry Brigade. Battle honours awarded to The Royal Canadian Regiment for its actions in the First World War included: &quot;Mount Sorrel, Somme, 1916, Flers-Courcelette, Ancre Heights, Arras, 1917, 18, Vimy, 1917, Hill 70, Ypres, 1917, Passchendaele, Amiens, Scarpe, 1918, Hindenburg Line, Canal du Nord, Pursuit to Mons, FRANCE AND FLANDERS, 1914–18&quot;.

Among the honours and awards to members of the regiment in the First World War was the Victoria Cross (VC) won by Lieutenant Milton Gregg. The RCR also recognizes the VC won by Lieutenant Frederick William Campbell, who was an officer of the 1st (Western Ontario) Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force, one of the battalions now perpetuated by The RCR.

===Inter-war years; 1919–1939===
The RCR remained a Permanent Force regiment between the wars and returned to its role of providing instruction to the Militia through garrisons in London (Ontario), Halifax (Nova Scotia), Toronto (Ontario) and Montreal (Quebec).

===Second World War; 1939–1945===
On 1 September 1939 the regiment was mobilized as part of the Canadian Active Service Force as Canada prepared for participation in the Second World War. When war was declared on September 10, the RCR had already been allocated to the 1st Canadian Infantry Brigade, a formation made up entirely of Ontario units. Moving to the United Kingdom in December 1939 as a component of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division, the RCR saw hard training for almost four years.

On 10 July 1943, the RCR landed at Pachino in the opening waves of the Allied invasion of Sicily – the last member of the regiment to participate in these original waves – George F. Burrows of Chatham Ontario – died on April 11, 2012, in Windsor, Ontario at the age of 88. The regiment and its sister units in the 1st Brigade, The Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment and the 48th Highlanders of Canada fought in several battles as the division advanced north and then east towards Messina. After the 38-day campaign on the island was completed, the regiment was involved in another amphibious landing (codenamed Operation Baytown) at Reggio di Calabria, as part of Allied invasion of the Italian mainland in September.

The RCR fought in several battles of the Italian campaign, including key engagements in the Moro River valley near Ortona in December 1943. During 1944, the regiment took part the Battle of Monte Cassino in attacks on German defensive lines called the Hitler Line and later the Gothic Line.

The regiment was transferred to northwest Europe in February 1945 during Operation Goldflake and took part in the liberation the Dutch city of Apeldoorn. The regiment received 28 battle honours for its participation in the Second World War. The regiment returned home to Canada in 1945.

===Post-war period and the Korean War; 1945–1953===
In 1950 the regiment was called upon to contribute to Canada&#x27;s forces for the Korean War. A new Active Service Force (Special Force) was to be raised, and the regiment expanded to a two-battalion, then a three-battalion, organization. The 2nd Battalion, followed by the 1st and 3rd Battalions, each saw service in Korea. The 2nd Battalion helped stabilize the 38th parallel, most notably at the Chail-li sector. In October 1952, the 1st Battalion fought the Chinese at the battle of Kowang-san (Hill 355 – Little Gibraltar). It was replaced by the 3rd Battalion, which took over the Jamestown Line on Hill 187, where it fought one of the last engagements before the armistice in 1953. After the end of the Korean War, the regiment was reduced to two battalions, when the 3rd Battalion was disbanded in July 1954.

===Cold War; 1953–1992===
In 1954 two London, Ontario, Militia regiments, the Canadian Fusiliers (City of London Regiment) (MG) and The Oxford Rifles were amalgamated and redesignated The London and Oxford Fusiliers (3rd Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment). This unit thus became the Reserve component of The RCR. In 1958, it was renamed 3rd Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment (London and Oxford Fusiliers).

In 1989, the designation of the Reserve battalion was shortened to 4th Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment. This amalgamation also brought to the regiment the perpetuation of a number of battalions of the First World War Canadian Expeditionary Force, including the 1st, 33rd, 71st, 142nd and 168th Battalions as well as the 2nd Battalion of the Canadian Machine Gun Corps. The amalgamation also saw the total battle honours for the First World War, based on the combined list of amalgamated components of the regiment, increase to the full list seen below.

The Militia battalion (3rd Battalion) was renumbered as the 4th Battalion in 1970 when the Canadian Guards were reduced to nil strength and the soldiers of that regiment&#x27;s 2nd Battalion (at CFB Petawawa) became the restored 3rd Battalion, The RCR, on the Regular Force order of battle. At the same time, the 2nd Battalion of The RCR was relocated to CFB Gagetown, New Brunswick, and reconstituted from the soldiers of the Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada as its two battalions there were also reduced to nil strength and removed from the active regiments in the army&#x27;s Regular Force order of battle.

During the 1950s and 1960s, battalions of The RCR were stationed as part of 4 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group at Fort York, Germany. These deployments were executed by 1RCR (1955–57 and 1962–65) and 2RCR (1953–55 and 1965–70). 3rd Battalion was later deployed to Germany, stationed in Baden-Söllingen 1977–84 and 1988–93.

All three Regular Force battalions of The RCR were deployed during the October Crisis in 1970 as part of the government&#x27;s response to the FLQ. Major John Hasek became the first commander of the Skyhawks Parachute Team when it formed in 1971. The three Regular Force battalions were also deployed in to support the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec.

Throughout the Cold War period, The RCR participated in Canada&#x27;s contributions to United Nations peacekeeping. For battalions of the regiment, this meant rotating tours on the island of Cyprus. The six-month tours of this mission, named Operation Snowgoose, were executed by elements of the regiment 13 times between 1966 and 1992.

In 1977 the 3rd Battalion was posted to CFB Baden-Soellingen in Germany.

In 1983, a Century of Service plaque at the Royal Military College Saint-Jean commemorates the centennial of the Royal Canadian Regiment, 1883–1983 Canada&#x27;s oldest permanent force infantry regiment. Elements of the regiment garrisoned at Saint John sur Richelieu from 1884 to 1908 and 1924–.

In 1984 the battalion was rotated to Winnipeg. In 1988 the battalion was rotated back to Baden until the base was closed in 1993 at which time it was disbanded in Germany and subsequently stood up at CFB Borden, Ontario, as a &quot;10/90&quot; battalion. The &quot;10/90&quot; concept created an infantry battalion in each Regular Force regiment with approximately 10 per cent of its personnel being full-time Regular soldiers, while the remaining positions were filled by Reserve Force soldiers from affiliated units in the region. These units existed until 1996 when the three 10/90 battalions were stood down and replaced by light infantry battalions on the Regular Force order of battle. Initially formed without specific regimental affiliation, within the year the light infantry battalion was relocated to CFB Petawawa and officially designated the 3rd Battalion, The RCR.

In 1990, HQ and Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Company (the first rifle company) of the 1st Battalion deployed to Cornwall, Ontario, as part of Operation Kahnawake. The 2nd Battalion, as part of 5 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group, deployed to the Montreal region to partake in Operation Salon. These deployments were part of the government&#x27;s response to the Oka Crisis.

In 1991, M Company and a platoon from P Company from 3rd Battalion (CFB Baden-Soellingen, Germany) and C Company from 1RCR (CFB London, Ontario) served in the Persian Gulf during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, the first Gulf War. These companies were employed on airfield and field hospital security duties.

===Peacekeeping era; 1992–2004===
In 1992, soldiers from the English-speaking N Company of the 3rd Battalion (Major Devlin), based in Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Baden-Soellingen in Germany, as an attachment to the French-speaking Royal 22e Régiment, operationally secured the Sarajevo airport during the Yugoslav wars. This operation saw a redeployment of the entire battle group from Croatia to Sarajevo, under the command of General Lewis MacKenzie.

Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada, made mention of this operational force and its commitment to international peace while she was in the National Capital Region that same year during Canada&#x27;s 125th, stating:

Shortly thereafter the Governor General of Canada bestowed the Commander-in-Chief Unit Commendation to N Company. The official warrant stated:

The unit returned to Bosnia for a tour with the Stabilization Force, SFOR, in 1998 and 1999.

All three Regular Force battalions served as peacekeepers in the Sinai Peninsula, in Bosnia. The 1st Battalion served in Kosovo under NATO mission Operation Kinetic, Rotation 1, December 1999–May 2000.

In 2000, the 2nd Battalion had the honour of mounting the Queen&#x27;s Guard at Buckingham Palace, when a detachment came to London to commemorate the Canadian involvement in the Second Boer War, and to celebrate the re-opening of Canada House. Later that year, H Company Group of 2nd Battalion deployed to eastern Africa as part of UNMEE.

As the United States prepared to launch military actions against Iraq, 2 RCR formed a provisional battle group and was warned off that if the government decided to participate, it would deploy. The government decided against participation and instead decided to return to Afghanistan. I Company Group deployed to Kabul on 26 May 2003 to form the Defence and Security Company for the construction of the Canadian camp. It returned to Canada in August of that year after 3rd Battalion Group took on ISAF operations.

The &quot;Leadership Award&quot; (2000) by André Gauthier (sculptor) was commissioned for The Royal Canadian Regiment.

In March 2004 the same company deployed to Port-au-Prince, Haiti, as part of Operation Halo (Operation &quot;Secure Tomorrow&quot; as the United States called it) to conduct security operations as part of the Multinational Interim Force. This force was set in place in order to set the conditions for the United Nations to take over. I Company conducted a relief in place with H Company Group in June. H Company changed roles to the UN force and redeployed to Gonaïves, Haiti. It returned to Canada in September of that year.

===Afghanistan; 2003–present===
In August 2003, the 3rd Battalion deployed to Kabul Afghanistan as part of Operation Athena for a six-month tour of duty. The battalion suffered the first Canadian casualties effected by enemy action in the war and conducted the first Canadian company-level direct action raid against insurgent forces since the Korean War.

In August 2006, the 1st Battalion deployed to Afghanistan as part of Operation Athena, replacing the 1st Battalion, Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry (PPCLI) for a six-month tour of duty in theatre.

In February 2007, the 2nd Battalion replaced the 1st Battalion in Afghanistan for a tour of duty.

In September 2008, 3rd Battalion replaced 2nd Battalion, PPCLI, as part of Operation Athena, Roto 6, forming the core of the Task Force Kanadahar Battle Group. It served until relieved in place by 2nd Battalion, Royal 22e Régiment in April 2009. The predeployment training of a platoon from the battalion was filmed for the reality television series &quot;Combat School&quot;.

In April 2010, the 1st Battalion deployed for Task Force 1–10

In February 2012, the 2nd Battalion formed the core of Rotation 1 of the Canadian Contribution Training Mission – Afghanistan and deployed to Kabul on Operation Attention till November 2012.

In October–November 2018, an 82-strong contingent from all four battalions and 38 members of the Royal Canadian Artillery Band provided the Queen&#x27;s Guard at Buckingham Palace, St James&#x27;s Palace and the Tower of London, as well as Windsor Castle.

The RCR has contributed personnel to Canadian Forces Joint Task Force-Ukraine since 2014.

==Recognition==

==Honorary appointments==
===Colonel-in-chief===
Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was appointed as the colonel-in-chief of the RCR on 8 December 1953 and held the appointment until his death in 2021. Prince Philip had only one predecessor in this appointment: Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, from 1929 to 1942.

===Colonel of the regiment===
The colonel of the regiment, through such appointment, holds the pre-eminent position in the conduct of regimental affairs. He is the senior member of the Regimental Council, an advisor to The RCR Association Board of Directors and The RCR Trust Fund. The Colonel of the Regiment is former Governor General of Canada David Johnston, who accepted the appointment on August 4, 2018.

===Honorary lieutenant-colonel, 4th Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment===
The honorary lieutenant-colonel, through such appointment, is specifically an adviser and mentor to the 4th Battalion, as the Colonel of the Regiment is to the Regiment as a whole. The Honorary Lieutenant Colonel is a member of The RCR Senate and acts as an adviser to The RCR Association Board of Directors and The RCR Trust Fund. The current honorary lieutenant-colonel (HLCol) of the 4th Battalion is Colonel Bruce W. Burnham, of Ilderton, Ontario.

===Patron===
On 5 June 2012, Judith Irving was officially appointed first patron of the Regiment.

In December 2013, Mike Holmes was officially appointed a patron of the Regiment.

===Regimental Sculptor===
On 26 June 2013, Christian Cardell Corbet was officially appointed the first Regimental Sculptor. This took place at Canada House, London, UK where Corbet was presented with a regimental tie following the unveiling of his portrait bust of the Colonel in Chief of The Regiment, The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, KG, KT.

==RCR cap badge==
&quot;An eight-pointed diamond cut star; upon the star a raised circle surmounted by the crown; within the raised circle, the block letters &quot;VRI&quot;, the Imperial Cypher of Queen Victoria.&quot; (Description of the badge of The RCR as presented in &quot;Regiments and Corps of the Canadian Army&quot;, published by the Army Historical Section, 1964)

The letters VRI on the cap badge of The RCR stand for &quot;Victoria Regina Imperatrix&quot;, which is Latin for &quot;Victoria, Queen and Empress&quot;. The right to wear the imperial cypher and crown was granted to the regiment by Queen Victoria in 1893.

When a royal or imperial cypher forms part of the badge of a regiment it is normal for it to change with each succeeding sovereign. During the period 1901 to 1919, the officially authorized versions of the regiment&#x27;s cap badge were those with Edward VII&#x27;s and George V&#x27;s cyphers, although the regiment continued to use the &quot;VRI&quot; ensigned badges throughout this time while petitioning for their formal return. In 1919, George V granted The Royal Canadian Regiment permission to wear &quot;VRI&quot; in perpetuity – a unique privilege.

==Company designations==
The companies of the battalions of The RCR are lettered sequentially across the regiment:
* 1st Battalion – A to F
* 2nd Battalion – G to L
* 3rd Battalion – M to R
* 4th Battalion – S, T and X (S Company consists of a company headquarters as well as two rifle platoons in London, Ontario, and 3 Platoon in Stratford, Ontario. T Company consists of a company headquarters in Stratford, Ontario, and X Company consists of the battalion headquarters personnel.)

In the Regular Force battalions, the first four companies are rifle companies, and the latter two are combat support (weapons) and administration company (combat service support).

When on parade, companies parade in alphabetic order. Companies are normally addressed by the NATO phonetic alphabet for their designation letter with the following exceptions:
* A Coy, 1RCR, is designated and always referred to as &quot;Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Company&quot; or, colloquially, &quot;Duke&#x27;s Company&quot;
* C Coy, 1RCR, is known as &quot;Charles&quot; Company. This unique designation was adopted during the Korean War, as the company was noted for maintaining a very high standard of dress and deportment.
* M Coy, 3RCR, is often referred to as &quot;Para&quot; Company, short for Parachute Company, at the discretion of the commanding officer, although this title is not officially recognized by the regiment as other than a colloquial nickname, even as the 3rd Battalion is now airborne-capable

==Regimental bands==

===Bugles and Drums===
The first band of The RCR was formed under &quot;A&quot; Company of the Infantry School Corps in 1894, when Sergeant Charles Hayes, a graduate of Kneller Hall Music College, enlisted in January 1894. That same year the corps also reported training nine buglers for the Militia.

By 1899, the authorized establishment for the regiment included four &quot;Sergt. Trumpeters or Drummers&quot; on the staff of the Regimental Depots along with 16 &quot;Trumpeters, Buglers or Drummers&quot; between the stations of the regiment. By 1901, the authorized establishment had changed to one &quot;Sergt. Trumpeters or Drummers&quot; and 12 &quot;Trumpeters, Buglers or Drummers&quot;, possibly indicating a consolidation of musicians into a regimental band rather than a training cadre at each garrison.

The regiment reported having an active band throughout much of the First World War, once their instruments were smuggled forward for them to use. With few lapses, the regiment maintained a Drum and Bugle band at least until the 1990s, when the 1st Battalion had a Drum and Bugle Corps within the ranks of C Company.

===Pipes and Drums===
In 1970, following a review of the regular army, a number of infantry battalions were disbanded. The Canadian Guards and the Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada lost both of their regular battalions, with personnel being distributed to The Royal Canadian Regiment. The 2nd Battalion, Royal Canadian Regiment adopted the Pipes and Drums of the Black Watch, becoming the Pipes and Drums of the 2nd Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment. The 3rd Battalion of The RCR, similarly, adopted the Pipes and Drums of the 2nd Battalion, The Canadian Guards, when they were disbanded. In 1977 the 3rd Battalion Pipes and Drums were redesignated the Special Service Force Pipes and Drums.

The 2nd Battalion The Royal Canadian Regiment currently maintains the only Pipes and Drums in the Canadian regular army. Regimental pipers where a distinctive cap badge in their glengarry or feather bonnet. This is the regimental cap badge on a circular belt on which the Regiment&#x27;s name is inscribed. This follows the practice of the Canadian Guards pipers&#x27; cap badge. In the 2000s, the Pipe Band began wearing an embroidered piper&#x27;s badge with their feather bonnets.

===RCR Band===
The members of the regiment who form the Drum and Bugles and Pipes and Drums bands are trained infantrymen of their battalions who are employed secondarily as musicians. The RCR Band, in contrast, was a professional brass and reed band manned by military musicians. The band in its final state was formed at Wolseley Barracks in 1947. It subsequently moved to CFB Gagetown in 1970 as a consequence of the 1968 Canadian Forces unification. During this period, it participated in many high profile events including the Canadian Armed Forces Tattoo held as part of the 1967 Canadian Centennial. It also played at events as diverse as the 1980 Silver Broom curling championship in Fredericton, during the Royal Visit to New Brunswick in 1984, and at the 40th anniversary of the liberation of the Netherlands in 1985. The band also took part in the Trooping the Colours and other events as part of the RCR centennial celebration held in London, Ontario, in 1983. In its earlier forms, it was guided by the &quot;Standing Orders of The Royal Canadian Regiment&quot; of 1935, which constituted its activities. A notable member of the band is Jean-Pierre Montminy, an officer who has served in as well as at the Canadian Forces School of Music.

<text>Nancy Lusk Zimpher (born October 29, 1946) is an American educator, state university leader, and former Chancellor of the State University of New York (SUNY). Prior to her service at SUNY, Zimpher was a dean and professor of education at Ohio State University (where she had earned her bachelors, master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees); then Chancellor of the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee between 1998 and 2003; and President of the University of Cincinnati from 2003 through May 2009. Zimpher was the first woman to serve as Chancellor of SUNY, UWM&#x27;s first woman chancellor, and UC&#x27;s first female president. Zimpher is a native of the village of Gallipolis in southern Ohio.

== Administrative career ==

=== University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee ===
At UWM (where she was the first female chancellor of that university), Zimpher created the now-defunct &quot;Milwaukee Idea&quot;, a deliberately derivative variation on the historical Wisconsin Idea that &quot;the University&#x27;s boundaries are the State&#x27;s boundaries&quot;, with a strategic plan that tied UWM, with its faculty knowledge base and research facilities, to the economic health and strength of the Greater Milwaukee area, and raised the profile of UWM in the region &quot;vis-a-vis&quot; crosstown rival Marquette University.

=== University of Cincinnati ===
At UC, she worked to eliminate the previous divisions among the colleges (such as by creating a single university commencement) and continuously championed &quot;UC|21&quot;, an academic plan which redefined UC as a &quot;new urban research university&quot; for the 21st century. It has also positioned Cincinnati as a candidate for AAU status. Her work was complicated by controversy over her ousting of longtime basketball coach Bob Huggins. Shortly after her arrival at UC, Huggins had been arrested for driving under the influence. This arrest, combined with the poor performance of Huggins&#x27; players in the classroom, were among many factors that led Zimpher to force Huggins to resign in 2005.

=== State University of New York ===
Soon after taking over at SUNY, Zimpher promised to visit all 64 campuses in the sprawling system—the largest university system in the nation under a single governing board.

Eight months after being sworn in, Zimpher had to deal with another athletic controversy, this time at Binghamton University. After a rash of incidents involving the school&#x27;s basketball team, Zimpher ordered an audit of Binghamton&#x27;s athletic department—to be overseen by the SUNY board of trustees, not Binghamton. The resulting report tallied what the &quot;New York Times&quot; described as &quot;a litany of transgressions, including lowered admission standards and changed grades.&quot; In its wake, Binghamton president Lois B. DeFleur retired in July, athletic director Joel Thirer resigned and basketball coach Kevin Broadus, was placed on paid administrative leave and ultimately stripped of coaching duties.

Zimpher eventually assigned SUNY’s interim provost, David K. Lavallee, to lead an overall effort for the SUNY system to ensure that academics remain the highest priority; and Charles R. Westgate, a professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Binghamton, as a special adviser for academics and athletics for the SUNY system: moves some critics of the over-emphasis on athletics decried as insufficient.

Zimpher advocated the use of systemness to begin overhauling SUNY in her January 9, 2012 State of the University address.

On May 31, 2016, Zimpher announced her intention to step down as SUNY chancellor on June 30, 2017.

== Family ==
Zimpher&#x27;s husband is Kenneth R. Howey, Senior Fellow at the Rockefeller Institute of Government, a public policy research institute at the University at Albany. She was also married to Craig Zimpher, Director of OSU residence hall Scott House, while studying for their advanced degrees at The Ohio State University from c: 1968 through the early 1970s.

<doc id="883836" wikidata="Q6938044" url="?curid=883836" title="Murder of Sarah Payne">
<text>Sarah Evelyn Isobel Payne (13 October 1991 –  1 July 2000) was the victim of a high-profile abduction and murder in West Sussex, England in July 2000.

Her disappearance and the subsequent investigation into her murder became a prominent case in the United Kingdom, as did the campaign for changes to child protection legislation that resulted from the murder. The murder investigation was also notable for the use of forensic evidence, which played a major role in securing a conviction.

Roy Whiting was convicted of abduction and murder in December 2001 and sentenced to life imprisonment.

==Sarah Payne&#x27;s disappearance==
Sarah Payne, who lived in Hersham, Surrey, disappeared on the evening of 1 July 2000 from a cornfield near the home of her grandfather, Terence Payne, and his second wife Lesley, in Kingston Gorse, West Sussex, England. Payne had been playing with her two brothers (aged 13 and 11) and younger sister (aged 5) when she disappeared. A police search of the local area commenced, and quickly transformed into a nationwide search and national news story, with members of the Payne family (mostly her parents Michael and Sara) making daily television and newspaper appeals for her safe return.

Police officers and numerous volunteers scoured the area around Littlehampton for clues to Sarah&#x27;s disappearance. On 10 July, police announced that they had received information regarding the sighting of a girl who matched Sarah&#x27;s description at Knutsford Services on the M6 motorway in Cheshire on the morning after her disappearance. Three days later, Michael and Sara Payne were warned by police to &quot;prepare for the worst&quot;, explaining that the emphasis of their inquiries had shifted and that there was a possibility that their daughter might not be found safe and well.

On 17 July, a body was found in a field near Pulborough, West Sussex, from Kingston Gorse, where Payne was last seen. The next day, Sussex Police confirmed that the body had been identified as that of Sarah Payne. 

Police first visited Roy Whiting&#x27;s Littlehampton flat on the afternoon of 2 July 2000, but he was not there. They returned that evening and questioned him for over an hour. They were suspicious of his apparent lack of concern for Sarah, which differed from the attitude of at least one other known sex offender who had been questioned. When police returned and Whiting attempted to drive away in his van, he was stopped by police. He spent two days in custody but there was insufficient evidence to press charges and he was released on bail. By that time, police had found a receipt for fuel at Buck Barn garage on the A24, near Pulborough. The receipt contradicted Whiting&#x27;s alibi of being at a funfair in Hove at 5:30p.m. and then back at his flat by 9:30p.m. on the night of Sarah&#x27;s disappearance.
 After his release, Whiting did not return to his flat and went to live with his father in Crawley.

On 20 July, three days after Payne&#x27;s body was found, a shoe was recovered from a roadside in the village of Coolham, three miles from Pulborough, and identified as one of those belonging to Sarah Payne.

On 23 July 2000, Whiting stole a Vauxhall Nova in Crawley and was pursued by police at speeds of up to before he crashed into a parked vehicle. Whiting was arrested on charges of car theft and dangerous driving. He was remanded in custody until 27 September 2000, when he pleaded guilty to those charges and was jailed for 22 months. While he was in jail, police 
carried out forensic testing on his 1988 white Fiat Ducato van, which he had bought on 23 June 2000.

On 6 February 2001, following seven months of investigation, Whiting was charged with the murder of Sarah Payne.

==Trial==
On 6 February 2001 Whiting appeared at Lewes Crown Court and was charged with abduction and murder. He pleaded not guilty to both charges and was remanded in custody to continue serving his sentence for the motoring offences.

Whiting&#x27;s trial began on 14 November 2001, at Lewes Crown Court. The jury heard from several witnesses. The key witnesses included Sarah Payne&#x27;s oldest brother Lee, who had seen a &#x27;scruffy-looking man with yellowish teeth&#x27; driving through Kingston Gorse on the evening that Sarah went missing. However, Lee Payne had not picked out Whiting during an identity parade. Fibres from Whiting&#x27;s van were found on Sarah Payne&#x27;s recovered shoe, the only item of Payne&#x27;s clothing to be recovered. A strand of blonde hair on a T-shirt was found in Whiting&#x27;s van; a DNA test established there was a one-in-a-billion chance of it belonging to anyone other than Payne. The jury also heard the testimony of two motorists who recalled a white van being parked at the roadside and pulling off a track on the evening of 1 July 2000, near the site where Payne&#x27;s body was later found.

On 12 December 2001, after a four-week trial before Mr Justice Curtis and a jury, Whiting was convicted of the abduction and murder of Payne and was sentenced to life imprisonment. The trial judge said it was a rare case in which a life sentence should mean life.

After Whiting was convicted, his previous convictions were revealed–they had been withheld from the jury and media so as not to bias the jury and open the door for a future appeal. Whiting&#x27;s exposure as a repeat offender sparked renewed calls for the government to allow controlled public access to the sex offender&#x27;s register. On the day after Whiting&#x27;s conviction, the Home Office commented that such a system would be &quot;unworkable,&quot; as it could drive paedophiles &quot;underground&quot;, making it more difficult for the police to monitor and locate them, and it would put them in danger of vigilante attacks.

This case is notable for the extensive use of forensic science in establishing the prosecution case against Whiting. Twenty forensic experts from the fields of entomology, palynology and environmental profiling, oil and lubricant analysis, pathology, geology, and archaeology were employed. It has been estimated that the investigation involved 1,000 personnel and cost nearly £3million.

===Sentencing===
On 24 November 2002, Home Secretary David Blunkett ordered that Roy Whiting serve a minimum of 50 years in prison, making him ineligible for parole until 2051, when he would be 92. This was in effect an agreement with the trial judge&#x27;s recommendation of a whole life tariff. Within 48 hours of the ruling, the Law Lords and the European Court of Human Rights had ruled in favour of another convicted murderer (Anthony Anderson) who challenged the right of politicians to decide how long a murderer must spend in prison before being considered for parole.

In June 2004, the media reported that Whiting was applying to the Court of Appeal for a reduction of his sentence. Whiting&#x27;s lawyers argued that the 50-year tariff was politically motivated, as the decision was made at a time when the government was under fire from the public and media over a firefighters&#x27; strike. On 9 June 2010, a High Court Judge reduced Whiting&#x27;s sentence by 10 years; he will be eligible to apply for parole in 2041, when he will be 82. Payne&#x27;s mother, Sara, was present at the hearing; she said she was &quot;disappointed&quot; by the decision and said that &quot;life should mean life&quot;.

==Roy Whiting==

Roy William Whiting was born in Horsham on 26 January 1959, one of six children born to George and Pamela Whiting; three children did not survive infancy. The family lived in Langley Green, Crawley. Whiting attended Jordans Junior &amp; Infant School and Ifield Middle School, but he found school difficult and left early, taking a string of manual-labour jobs. When he was 17, his mother left the family home; Whiting stayed with his father.

Eventually, Whiting trained as a mechanic, went to work for a firm in Crawley, then started his own business. He also developed a keen interest in banger racing–he built his own car and earned a slot driving for the Gatwick Flyers under the name &quot;Flying Fish&quot;. 

In June 1986, Whiting married Linda Booker, who worked as a petrol pump attendant. As his business failed, the marriage fell apart and they separated before their son was born the following year. They divorced in 1990. Around this time, Whiting fathered a daughter with another unnamed woman.

===First conviction===
On 4 March 1995, an eight-year-old girl was abducted and sexually assaulted in the Langley Green area of Crawley. Whiting was arrested several weeks later; a man who knew him came forward after hearing that the abductor&#x27;s car was a red Ford Sierra, which matched the description of the car that Whiting had just sold. The vehicle was traced by police to its new owner and a knife was found hidden in it.

On 23 June 1995, Whiting admitted to charges of abduction and indecent assault, and was sentenced to four years in prison. The maximum sentence for the crime was life imprisonment; however, he received a lesser sentence because he had admitted to the crime at an early opportunity, although a psychiatrist who assessed Whiting after his conviction said that he was likely to re-offend once he was released.

Whiting was released from prison in November 1997, having served 2 years and 5 months of his 4-year sentence, and was one of the first people in Britain to go on the sex offenders&#x27; register. After refusing to participate in a sex offender rehabilitation programme, he was forced to serve an extra five months before being released on licence.

===Attacks in prison===
On 4 August 2002, Whiting was slashed with a razor by another prisoner at HMP Wakefield. In June 2004 convicted murderer Rickie Tregaskis was found guilty of carrying out the attack, which left Whiting with a scar on his right cheek. Tregaskis, already serving life for the murder of a disabled man in Cornwall, received a six-year sentence for the attack.

In July 2011, Whiting was stabbed in the eye. Whiting&#x27;s injuries were not life-threatening, no charge was pressed by Whiting, and no police investigation was undertaken.

A third attack on Whiting took place on 8 November 2018, when he was stabbed by two other prisoners in his cell. He was taken to hospital for treatment but was returned to prison shortly after in a stable condition.

On 11 February 2024, still at HM Prison Wakefield, Whiting was again attacked. A spokesman for West Yorkshire Police said: &quot;At 5:14 pm on Sunday 11 February 2024, police received a call from a member of staff at HMP Wakefield reporting a male prisoner had been stabbed. His injuries were described as &quot;minor&quot;

==Aftermath==
===Sarah&#x27;s Law===

The campaign for Sarah&#x27;s Law was spearheaded by the &quot;News of the World&quot;, and began in July 2000 in response to Payne&#x27;s murder. This became the campaign for what is known as Sarah&#x27;s Law, named after Megan&#x27;s Law in the United States following a similar case several years earlier. Her parents backed the campaign as they were sure that their daughter&#x27;s killer was a previously convicted child sex offender. Their belief was proved correct 17 months later when Roy Whiting was found guilty of the murder, and it was revealed that he already had a conviction for abducting and indecently assaulting an eight-year-old girl.

The aim of the campaign was for the government to allow controlled access to the sex offender registry, so parents with young children could know if a child sex offender lived in their area. Payne&#x27;s mother has always insisted that such a law would have saved her daughter&#x27;s life.

A modified scheme, whereby parents can enquire about a named individual who has regular access to their children, was introduced in four pilot areas of England and Wales in September 2008. In August 2010 the Home Office announced that, after proving successful, the Child Sex Offender Disclosure Scheme would be extended to cover the whole of England and Wales by spring 2011. This law allows parents to ask the police if somebody with regular access to their children has a record of sexual offences.

===Payne family===
In July 2001, it was reported that Payne&#x27;s parents received £11,000 compensation from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority, an executive agency of the UK Government. Sara Payne described the offer as a &quot;sick joke&quot; and &quot;derisory&quot;, even though it was the maximum CICA could offer by law. Media sources were also keen to criticise the payout and compare it to much higher payouts made in criminal and civil law for relatively minor injuries and work related stress.

In 2004 the book &quot;Sara Payne: A Mother&#x27;s Story&quot;, by Payne&#x27;s mother Sara Payne, about her daughter&#x27;s murder and the campaign for Sarah&#x27;s Law, was published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton.

Sara Payne was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in December 2008 for her work toward the passing of Sarah&#x27;s Law. In December 2009, she suffered a life-threatening stroke and collapsed while at her home but went on to make a good recovery.

In July 2011, it was revealed that Sara Payne had been among those targeted in the News International phone hacking scandal. Payne refused to believe it, since the &quot;News of the World&quot; had been so helpful in championing Sarah&#x27;s Law. She even wrote an editorial in the newspaper&#x27;s final edition. Investigators initially thought she was not hacked because her name did not come up in records. However, personal details relating to her were found that were attributed to another suspected victim. Sara&#x27;s phone that was hacked was given to her by the News of the World&#x27;s Rebekah Brooks, editor at the time of Sarah&#x27;s murder.

Payne&#x27;s father, Michael, suffered from depression following the disappearance of his daughter. He separated from Sara after 18 years of marriage in August 2003, and subsequently became an alcoholic, leading to a 16-month jail term for attacking his brother with a glass in December 2011, while intoxicated. On 30 October 2014, he was found dead at his home in Maidstone, Kent. Police reported there were no suspicious circumstances; he was believed to have died of an alcohol related illness several days before his body was found.

<text>USS &quot;New Hampshire&quot; (SSN-778), a &quot;Virginia&quot;-class nuclear-powered attack submarine, is the fourth vessel of the United States Navy to be named for the state of New Hampshire. She is the first of the &quot;Virginia-class&quot; Block-II submarines to enter service. Her name was awarded to the submarine after a letter-writing campaign by the third-graders from Garrison Elementary School and sixth graders from Dover Middle School in Dover to their members of Congress, the state governor, and the Secretary of the Navy.

==History==

The contract to build her was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 14 August 2003. Construction began in January 2004. A keel-laying ceremony for the submarine was held at Electric Boat&#x27;s Quonset Point facility in North Kingstown, Rhode Island, on 30 April 2007.
===Sponsor===
The ship&#x27;s sponsor was Cheryl McGuinness of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, the widow of Thomas McGuinness, co-pilot of American Airlines Flight 11, who died in the September 11, 2001 attacks when the jet was flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center.
===Launched===
The submarine was launched on 21 February 2008 and christened four months later, on 21 June 2008 in Groton, Connecticut, eight months ahead of schedule and $54 million under budget. &quot;New Hampshire&quot; finished sea trials and was delivered to the Navy on 28 August 2008. The boat was commissioned in a ceremony at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, on 25 October 2008.

Although she is the fourth vessel to carry this name, one of her predecessors, , was authorized but cancelled before keel laying.

== Equipment failure while on deployment ==

During the week of 13 March 2011, while on a mission under the Arctic ice cap, &quot;New Hampshire&quot; suffered an oxygen generator failure. This failure required the submarine to surface through the ice. The crew had used oxygen candles to make oxygen until the boat surfaced. United Technologies, the company responsible for building the oxygen generator, dispatched a representative with needed replacement parts to the submarine by way of a temporary ice camp, to assist the crew in repairing the problem.

<text>François Charles Louis, marquis de Chasseloup-Laubat (; August 18, 1754 – October 3, 1833) was a French general and military engineer during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.

==Biography==
François de Chasseloup-Laubat was born at Saint-Sornin (Charente Inferieure), of a noble family, and entered the French engineers in 1774.

He was still a subaltern at the outbreak of the Revolution, becoming captain in 1791. His ability as a military engineer was recognized in the campaigns of 1792 and 1793. In the following year he won distinction in various actions and was promoted successively &quot;chef de bataillon&quot; and colonel. He was chief of engineers at the siege of Mainz in 1793, after which he was sent to Italy. He there commanded the positions and lines of advance of the army of Bonaparte. He was promoted brigadier-general before the close of the campaign, and was subsequently employed in fortifying the new Rhine frontier of France.

His work as chief of engineers in the army of Italy (1799) was conspicuously successful, and after the battle of Novi he was made general of division. When Napoleon took the field in 1800 to retrieve the disasters of 1799, he again selected Chasseloup as his engineer general. During the peace of 1801-1805 he was chiefly employed in reconstructing the defences of northern Italy, and in particular the afterwards famous Quadrilateral. His &quot;chef-d&#x27;œuvre&quot; was the great fortress of Alessandria on the Tanaro.

In 1805 he remained in Italy with André Masséna, but at the end of 1806 Napoleon, then engaged in the Polish campaign, called him to the Grande Armée, with which he served in the campaign of 1806–07, directing the sieges of Colberg, Danzig and Stralsund. During the Napoleonic domination in Germany, Chasseloup reconstructed many fortresses, in particular Magdeburg. In the campaign of 1809 he again served in Italy. In 1810 Napoleon made him a councillor of state. His last campaign was that of 1812 in Russia.

He retired from active service soon afterwards, though in 1814 he was occasionally engaged in the inspection and construction of fortifications. Louis XVIII made him a peer of France and a knight of St Louis. He refused to join Napoleon in the Hundred Days, but after the second Restoration he voted in the chamber of peers against the condemnation of Marshal Ney.

In politics he belonged to the constitutional party. The king created him a marquis. Chasseloup&#x27;s later years were employed chiefly in putting in order his manuscripts, a task which he had to abandon owing to the failure of his sight. His only published work was &#x27; (Paris, 1801, republished Milan, 1805 and 1811, under the title &#x27;). The most important of his papers are in manuscript in the Depot of Fortifications, Paris.

As an engineer Chasseloup was an adherent, though of advanced views, of the old bastioned system perfected by Vauban. He followed in many respects the engineer H.J.B. de Bousmard, whose &quot;Essai General de Fortification&quot; was published in 1797 and who fell, as a Prussian officer, in the defence of Danzig in 1807 against Chasseloup&#x27;s own attack. His front as applied to Alessandria, contains many elaborations of the bastion trace, with, in particular, masked flanks in the &quot;tenaille&quot;, which served as extra flanks of the bastions. The bastion itself was carefully and minutely retrenched. The ordinary &quot;ravelin&quot; he replaced by a heavy casemated &quot;&quot; after the example of Montalembert, and, like Bousmard&#x27;s, his own ravelin was a large and powerful work pushed out beyond the &quot;glacis&quot;.

His wife, the daughter of François Fresneau de La Gataudière, brought him the Château de la Gataudière, at Marennes, Charente-Maritime; his youngest son, Prosper de Chasseloup-Laubat, was Minister of the Navy under Napoleon III.

<text>Rasputitsa (from ; literally &quot;season of bad roads&quot;) is the mud season that occurs in various rural areas of Eastern Europe, when the rapid snowmelt or thawing of frozen ground combined with wet weather in spring, or heavy rains in autumn lead to muddy conditions that make travel on unpaved roads problematic and even treacherous.

Rasputitsa has repeatedly affected wars by causing military vehicles and artillery pieces to become mired in the mud. In conjunction with the general conditions of winter, rasputitsa has been credited with encumbering the military campaigns of Napoleonic France in 1812 and Nazi Germany during Operation Barbarossa, as well as all belligerents in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The Russian term &quot;rasputitsa&quot; is derived from the root путь (&quot;put′&quot;), &#x27;road, way, travel&#x27; + the prefix рас- (&quot;ras&quot;) &#x27;discrepancy, divergence&#x27; + the diminutive suffix -иц (&quot;it͡s&quot;) + the feminine noun ending а (&quot;a&quot;). 

The Ukrainian term () usually refers to spring, and occasionally to autumn, when rain and/or melting snow on unpaved roads, tracks, paths, or any poorly-drained off-road area turns the route into impassable deep mud.

Swedish &#x27;bad going&#x27; and Finnish &#x27;broken state of roads&#x27; (lit. &#x27;weather-break&#x27;) also apply to when water is too iced over for boats but not strong enough to cross on foot or in other vehicles. Finnish eastern dialects also have the Russian loanword (), which has the same usage as .

In countries of the former Soviet Union, the concept is applied to two periods during the year – spring and autumn – and also refers to impassable road conditions during such a period, specifically the heavy rains of October and the thaw of the frozen steppe in March.

== Effects ==

These conditions in Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine are caused by high moisture storage capacity of black clay soils but not limited solely to the area of chernozem found in the region and works as a sponge. Roads are subject to weight limitations and closures during the period in certain districts. The phenomenon was a notable hindrance in the early 20th century, since 40% of rural villages in the erstwhile Soviet Union were not served by paved roads. The problem is less pronounced in elevated areas than in lowlands. 

Roads that run through wetlands are particularly susceptible to damage. This phenomenon not only affects motorists but also pedestrians, mining, logging and agricultural companies creating deep ruts and furrows. During the time of rasputitsa, some farm products cannot be delivered to the city (i.e. to market) and must be destroyed.

Autumn thawing occurs when the average daily air temperature drops to +5°C, which reduces the evaporation of moisture, and the frequency of rains saturating the upper soil layer increases. In Canada there is definitely a rasputitsa period, though it does not occur everywhere or necessarily in the fall, and it is not considered a rasputitsa by name.

Climate change in Russia and warmer winters in the Russian Arctic are a big disadvantage: rasputitsa lasted previously for 2–3 weeks, and now it reaches two months, as an inhabitant of an island near Archangelsk said in an interview.

== Armed conflict ==

The &quot;rasputitsa&quot; seasons are well-known as a defensive advantage in wartime. Spring thaw was a factor that helped prevent Novgorod from being overrun during the Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus&#x27; in the 13th century. The &#x27;season of bad roads&#x27; also proved to be a great hindrance in and after the Battle of Krasnoi, when many horses, carriages and cannon were stuck in the snow or mud and left behind during the French retreat from Russia. Rasputitsa reduced the mobility of both armies but it seemed to be more favorable to the defender. 

:Already on 29/30 June 1812 (five days after crossing the Russian border on their march towards Vilna) &quot;Marshal Mud&quot; played a significant role, when a violent thunderstorm struck Lithuania during the night and continued for a day. Ca 15 or 18,000 horses were lost; they sank to their knees on the primitively constructed roads through mostly swampy areas near Trakai. The Grande Armée lost 50,000 men in two days due to fatigue and want.

&quot;General Mud&quot; is a nickname (sometimes) used in the Western Front in the Battles of Ypres in December 1916.

During World War II, the months-long muddy period slowed the German advance into the Soviet Union during the Operation Typhoon on the Eastern Front, and may have helped save Moscow from falling under a German military occupation. The advent of Blitzkrieg had the disadvantage that while tanks could operate effectively in summer or in winter, they proved less useful in spring and autumn, when the functioning of an efficient railway system came into its own.

Prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, some analysts identified the logistical challenges of the mud season as a likely hindrance to any large-scale invasion in spring. When Russia crossed the border, many of its mobile units found themselves stranded in fields and limited to major roads, where resistance and logistical issues significantly slowed the advance toward Kyiv and elsewhere.

<doc id="883843" wikidata="Q5219791" url="?curid=883843" title="Danish Society of Engineers">
<text>IDA, The Danish Society of Engineers, () is a Danish trade union and interest group for highly educated professionals with a background in technology, science or IT. It has the abbreviation IDA (&quot;Ingeniørforeningen i Danmark&quot;). IDA&#x27;s headquarters are in Copenhagen, Denmark.

As of 2024, IDA has over 166,000 members. IDA&#x27;s main objectives are &quot;&quot;To gather Danish engineers and other eligible candidates to look after the interests of the engineerial profession&quot; and &quot;To assert the significance of technical and scientific education and research to society.&quot;&quot;

IDA organises both employees, managers and the self-employed, and offers advice and feedback on, for example, matters relating to career, job search, salary, legal issues and working environment.

As an association, IDA connects members based on their professional specialties e.g. IT, construction, environment or management. Members can also meet for personal development events or for social-cultural offers. IDA hosts around 3000 annual events throughout Denmark. Many of the events are organised by volunteer IDA members.

== Denmark&#x27;s Best Trade Union 2021, 2022 and 2023 ==
IDA was named the best trade union in Denmark in 2021, 2022 and again in 2023 in the &quot;Industry Index Trade Unions 2021, 22, 23” from Loyalty Group. In the survey, IDA scored highest on both member satisfaction and member loyalty.

== IDA’s members ==
Highly educated STEM professionals make up the majority of IDA members.

Number of members as of 2022, 2012 and 2002:

Unlike many unions, IDA organises both employees, managers (around 12%) and the self-employed (around 4%) and provides advice tailored to the different roles and work situations of members in each category.

=== International members ===
IDA has 10,400 (7%) English-speaking members who have either been recruited to Denmark for their professional skills and education, or who have completed their education in Denmark and chosen to settle there.

IDA supports non-Danish members in their transition to the Danish labour market by providing them with information on Danish workplace culture and the role of trade unions in Denmark. IDA provides the same advice to non-Danish-speaking members on legal matters, careers and working life, for example, as to Danish members.

IDA also organises a wide range of events in English.

=== Young professionals ===
In 2011 IDA established IDA Young Professionals (&quot;Danish: Yngre Fagligt Forum&quot;), a network for young professionals in Denmark. The network is active in the international umbrella organization European Young Engineers where it also represents young engineers from Denmark in the Council Meetings.

== Requirements for membership ==
A wide range of university programmes in the fields of STEM are qualifying for becoming a member of IDA. It is also possible to join IDA with other university degrees as a professional in an IT, engineering or technology company, for example in consultancies, financial institutions and many start-ups.

In addition, IDA membership is open to those without a degree who work in one of the three areas (digitisation, technology and science) at such a high level that their skills are equivalent to a long university degree.

== IDA&#x27;s history ==
The Danish Society of Engineers, IDA, was founded on 1 January 1995 by a merger between the two former engineering associations &quot;Danish Engineers Association&quot;, founded 1892 and The Engineers&#x27; Association (Danish: &quot;Ingeniør-Sammenslutningen),&quot; founded 1937. The two engineers&#x27; associations differed mainly in the type of engineers they admitted and thus in the positions they held.

The Danish Engineers&#x27; Association, DIF, was founded in 1892 as an association for graduates of the Polytechnic Institute (which later became DTU). In 1933, the title &quot;Master of Engineering&quot; was introduced for graduates with an engineering degree of at least 5 years.

The Engineers&#x27; Association, I-S originally consisted of 3 graduate associations for constructor and BSc graduates. These graduates typically had a shorter education compared to their colleagues from the Polytechnic, and they often had a more technical or craft-oriented background.

The two associations worked closely together on several issues and slowly worked towards a merger. In 1975, the two associations&#x27; membership magazines were merged to form Ingeniøren, and in 1976 the merger was put to a vote in the two associations. But the members of DIF were not ready for a merger.

It took 18 years before the members of both associations finally voted in favour of a merger. The year after the vote in 1995, the merger was a reality.

=== Chairpersons through the years ===
* Laura Klitgaard, Master of Engineering in Architecture, 2022 
* Aske Nydam Guldberg, Master of Engineering in circular economy (Acting Chairperson until 2023)
* Thomas Damkjær Petersen, Master of Engineering, 2016-2022
* Frida Frost, Master of Engineering, 2010-2016
* Lars Bytoft, Bachelor of Engineering, 2004-2010
* Per Ole Front, Master of Engineering, 1999-2004
* Ole Schiøth, Master of Engineering, 1995-1999

== Organisation ==
IDA works in three different areas simultaneously:

* As a trade union: IDA&#x27;s purpose is to ensure a good working life for its members, to train and retrain as many as possible to meet the needs of the labour market, and to provide advice on legal and career-related issues. 
* As a political interest group: IDA seeks to influence Danish politicians, the business community and other stakeholders to put knowledge and education first and base decisions on expert knowledge. 
* As a business: IDA Insurance and IDA Conference are independent companies that are part of IDA Group operate alongside the Danish Society of Engineers, IDA.

=== IDA as a trade union ===
A number of IDA branches have direct contact with members and assist them across a wide range of concerns and challenges related to their work life.

* IDA helps the professional groups it represents to organise in the workplace, trains union representatives and assists in negotiations between employee organisations and employers.
* IDA&#x27;s legal department reads employment contracts for new recruits, negotiates resignations for terminated members and takes responsibility if a dispute between parties goes to court.
* IDA&#x27;s career counsellors helps members organise their working lives to best suit the individual.
* IDA&#x27;s occupational health and safety consultants assist both members and companies employing IDA members in ensuring healthy working conditions and practices for employees.
* IDA Learning collects and compiles courses and continuing education in the fields in which IDA members work.
* 73 volunteer-based technical networks are organised through IDA. The technical networks are made up of volunteer members who share a common professional interest and come into contact with other professionals in their field via IDA. The networks gather both for social events and professional conferences.
* While still a student, one can join IDA and get access to low-cost insurance, social and professional networking events, online job search workshops and exam guides and tutoring.

==== Member democracy ====
The IDA Board of Representatives is the supreme authority of the association. The Board of Representatives consists of 65 persons elected by the voting members of the Association. Graduate members elect 61 persons to the Board of Representatives and student members elect 4 persons to the Board of Representatives.

Elections to the Board of Representatives are held every 3 years. The Board of Representatives elects an executive committee, which is responsible to the Board of Representatives for the management of the association. The Executive Committee is elected for a period of 3 years. The members of the executive committee can be re-elected only once. The Board of Representatives shall also elect a Chairperson for a term of three years. Re-election is possible once.

IDA is also the setting for a wide range of regional network all of which are run by active members on voluntary boards.

=== IDA as a political interest group ===
The political work of IDA is an extension of the work of the Board of Representatives. While the Board of Representatives sets the direction for the work of the IDA, the staff of the IDA Policy Department is responsible for implementing the decisions.

== IDA Group ==
IDA also has a number of wholly or partly owned subsidiaries related to IDA&#x27;s core businesses.

* IDA Insurance- IDA Insurance is an insurance mediator offering insurance to members.
* IDA Conference - IDA Conference is a conference centre located in the IDA headquarters in Copenhagen and offers facilities for meetings and conferences.

<doc id="883857" wikidata="Q1093666" url="?curid=883857" title="Marc René, marquis de Montalembert">
<text>Marc René, marquis de Montalembert (16 July 1714 – 29 March 1800) was a French military engineer and writer, known for his work on fortifications.

==Life==
He was born at Angoulême, and entered the French Army in 1732. He fought in the War of the Polish Succession on the Rhine (1733–34), and in the War of the Austrian Succession made the campaigns of 1742 in Bohemia and Italy. In the years preceding the Seven Years&#x27; War, Montalembert (who had become an associate member of the Académie des Sciences in 1747) devoted his energies to the art of fortification, to which Vauban&#x27;s &quot;Traité de l&#x27;attaque&quot; attracted him, and founded the cannon foundry Ruelle Foundry at Ruelle, near his birthplace.

On the outbreak of war he became French commissioner with the allied army of Sweden, with the rank of brigadier-general. He constructed the field fortifications of Anklam and Stralsund. In 1761 he was promoted &quot;maréchal de camp&quot;, and began the works on which his fame rests. Montalembert&#x27;s fortress has been aptly described by an English author as an &quot;immense battery.&quot; The intricacies of trace by which Vauban and Cormontaigne sought to minimize the power of the attack, are abandoned in favour of a simple tenaille plan so arranged that the defenders can bring an overwhelming fire to bear on the works of the besieger.

Montalembert, who himself drew his idea from the practice of Swedish and Prussian engineers, furnished the German constructors of the early 19th century with the means of designing entrenched camps suitable to modern conditions of warfare. The &quot;polygonal&quot; method of fortification is the direct outcome of Montalembert&#x27;s systems. In his own country the caste-spirit of the engineer corps was roused to defend Vauban, and though Montalembert was allowed to construct some successful works at Île-d&#x27;Aix and Oleron, he was forbidden to publish his method, and given but little opportunity for actual building. After fifteen years of secrecy he published in Paris (1776–1778) the first edition of &quot;La Fortification perpendiculaire&quot;.

At the time of the Revolution he surrendered a pension, which had been granted him for the loss of an eye, although he was deeply in debt, particularly on account of his Ruelle foundry, on which 6000 livres were due to him from the state, which he never received. Persuaded by his writer and actress wife, he joined in the emigration of the &quot;noblesse&quot;, and for a time lived in England. All his possessions were thereupon sequestrated by the republican government. He very soon returned, divorced his wife, and married the daughter of an apothecary. He obtained the annulment of the sequestration.

Carnot often called him into consultation on military affairs, and, in 1792, promoted him general of division. Proposed as a member of the Institut de France in 1797, he withdrew his candidature in favour of General Bonaparte.

His wife, Marie Josephine de Comarieu, was the hostess of one of the best-known salons of Louis XVI&#x27;s time. She wrote two novels of merit, &quot;Elise Dumesnil&quot; (1798) and &quot;Horace&quot; (1822). She died in 1832.

Besides his masterpiece, he wrote &quot;L&#x27;Art défensif supérieur à l&#x27;offensif&quot; (1793; in reply to attacks made upon his earliest work, &quot;La Fortification perpendiculaire&quot;, of which in later editions it forms part); &quot;Mémoire historique sur la fonte des canons&quot; (Paris, 1758), and other works on the same subject; &quot;&quot; (London, 1777); &quot;Rotation des boulets&quot; (Acad., 1755); and &quot;Relation du siège de Saint-Jean-d&#x27;Acre&quot; (Paris, 1789).

He also wrote short stories and verse, as well as comedies. He also modelled a complete course of fortification (92 models), which he offered to the Committee of Public Safety. His bust was sculptured by Bonvallet.

Montalembert&#x27;s position in the history of fortification may be summed up as a realization of his own wish to do for the defence what Vauban had done for the attack. It was the inability of his contemporaries to see that Vauban&#x27;s strength lay in his parallels and batteries and not in his bastions that vitiated their methods, and it was Montalembert&#x27;s appreciation of this fact which made him the father of modern fortification. See Tripier, &quot;La Fortification déduite de son histoire&quot; (Paris, 1866).

==Family==
His nephew, also called Marc-René (1777-1831), is father of Charles Forbes René de Montalembert who was a French politician.

==History==
In the summer of 1943, Army Cadet Camps were organized in eleven locations across Canada for 10 days duration each. In the summer of 1947, the first experimental six-week camp was held at Camp Ipperwash on Lake Huron, North of Sarnia, Ontario. Originally opened on 28 January 1942 as A29 Canadian Infantry Training Centre.

Although A29 CITC ceased operations in 1945, the camp remained open as a training centre for the Regular Force, Reserves. In 1946, the camp was used as a two-week summer camp for army cadets, as an experiment. It was a success and as a result was expanded in 1947 as the summer home of the Central Command Cadet Camp. Cadets attended Basic Training, Signalling, Driver-Mechanics, and Senior Leaders courses.

In 1948, the camp was further expanded and paved the way for similar camps in Dundurn, Vernon and Aldershot in the late 1940s and early 50s.

In 1994, because of a First Nation land claim, the Ipperwash Army Cadet Camp moved to Canadian Forces Base Borden, and was renamed the Blackdown Army Cadet Summer Training Centre.

The first Commanding Officer of this new Cadet Training Centre was LtCol Dirk in 1994. Since then Blackdown has continued to evolve both in the types of courses offered and the facilities themselves. From 1994 until 2003 cadet sleeping quarters and training facilities were modular tents with cots. Since 2003, there have been significant additions including improvements to the sleeping quarters.

In 2003, the first of many tri-force courses arrived in Blackdown Cadet Summer Training Centre.; which meant the closure of the Borden Air Cadet Camp.

In 2012, the training centre saw 179 adult staff members, 193 Staff Cadets and 1819 Course Cadets enter the gates.

<text>Fortrea Holdings Inc. is a contract research organization organized in Delaware and headquartered in Durham, North Carolina with operations in 90 countries. Its customers are primarily in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device industries. 

Its primary business is handling all aspects of clinical trials including phase I through IV clinical trial management, clinical pharmacology, and post-approval services. It handles regulatory affairs, protocol design, operational planning, study and site start-up, patient recruitment, project management, monitoring, data management and biostatistics, pharmacovigilance, medical writing, and mobile clinical services. It focuses on oncology, central nervous system and neurodegenerative, rare diseases, and cell and gene therapies. In the five years ending in 2023, it conducted more than 5,850 clinical trials involving over 1 million subjects. It also conducted over 600 studies for medical device companies. 

The company is one of the largest participants in the international primate trade and has been criticized for its animal testing practices, most specifically animal testing on non-human primates.

The company traces its roots to Environmental Sciences Corporation, formed in 1968. It was known as Hazleton from 1972 to 1990, Corning Lab Services from 1990 to 1996, Covance from 1996 to 2021, and Labcorp Drug Development from 2021 to 2023.

==History==
===1968–1999===
In 1968, Environmental Sciences Corporation was established in Seattle, Washington, manufacturing equipment related to laboratory animals. In 1972, it acquired and took the name of Hazleton Laboratories, a contract laboratory that conducted toxicology testing. In 1977, Corning Inc. purchased a stake in Hazleton and in 1987, it acquired the remainder of the company for $115 million. By 1982, Hazleton was the largest independent biological testing company and life sciences laboratory in the U.S. and the largest laboratory equipment manufacturer worldwide. The company carried out animal toxicology tests of drugs, cosmetics, pesticides, and industrial chemicals, and bred rhesus monkeys and beagles for its own labs, as well as for chemical and drug companies, hospitals, universities and government agencies. It offered chemical analysis of new compound products for various industries, tested chemicals for gene mutations, and carried out research with monoclonal antibodies. It sold the equipment manufacturing unit in the mid-1980s.

In 1989, Corning Glass Works acquired G.H. Besselaar Associates, which conducted clinical trials for drug approvals. In 1990, Hazleton acquired Microtest, a molecular toxicology center in York, England. Corning Glass Works changed its name to Corning, and folded Besselaar and Hazelton into a new subsidiary, Corning Lab Services. In 1991, Corning Lab Services acquired SciCor.

==Controversies==
===Reston virus: monkeys with ebola virus brought to U.S.===
In December 1989, several crab-eating macaques with the Zaire ebolavirus were imported from Mindanao in the Philippines to the company&#x27;s facility in Reston, Virginia. The strain of the virus became known as the Reston virus. It was the first ebola virus that emerged outside of Africa and was also the first known natural infection of ebola virus in nonhuman primates. The facility was abandoned and torn down and the variant turned out to be non-lethal to humans. The incident was an inspiration for &quot;The Hot Zone&quot;, a book by Richard Preston published in 1994.

In March 1996, two macaques that had been shipped to the company&#x27;s facility in Alice, Texas, tested positive for the Ebola virus from a group of 100 obtained from the same supplier. The virus strain was the same non-lethal Reston virus as in the earlier incident.

===Animal welfare issues===
====Reports from investigative journalists====
In 2003, a German investigative journalist sponsored by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV) filmed 40 hours of undercover footage at the company&#x27;s primate-testing facility in Münster. Two films were produced, which were shown on German public television in December 2003. The footage showed animal keepers dancing with half-anaesthetized monkeys, making their heads move to the rhythm of the music. It also showed rough treatment of the monkeys by the staff. The monkeys were seen living isolated in small wire cages with little or no natural light and no environmental enrichment, with high noise levels caused by staff shouting and playing the radio, and undergoing surgery with no post-operative care. In response, the company maintained that clips showing different technicians working in different buildings had been edited together, resulting in a sequence of events that did not take place. The company also said there was group housing and pair housing for some monkeys that was not shown. In the films, the treatment of the monkeys was criticized by Jane Goodall. The environment minister for North Rhine-Westphalia asked the public prosecutor to investigate, and said that if the allegations were borne out, the company would lose its licence to keep primates. The company gained an injunction against the video.

From April 2004 to March 2005, an undercover technician, sponsored by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), filmed the treatment of monkeys in the company&#x27;s lab in Vienna, Virginia. Incidents filmed included the punching of injured monkey, failure to give veterinary care and self-mutilation by monkeys because of &quot;failure to provide psychological enrichment&quot;. The United States Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration investigated the claims and company agreed to a settlement of $8,720 and to fix the infractions. In June 2005, the company filed a lawsuit in the United States against PETA and the investigator for fraud, breach of employee contract, and conspiracy. PETA agreed to hand over all video footage and written notes to the company, and agreed to a ban on conducting any infiltration of the company for five years. The company then dropped the lawsuit. The company filed a parallel lawsuit in England in an attempt to stop PETA showing the tape; the British judge called the footage &quot;highly disturbing&quot;, and ruled that there was a legitimate public interest in the material being shown. The case was settled with PETA allowed to continue to publish the video.

====Celebrity protests of business expansion====
In 2006, Paul McCartney protested a proposed $175 million animal testing laboratory by the company in Chandler, Arizona. However, the laboratory opened in 2009.

====Animal welfare citations by the United States Department of Agriculture====
In June 2011, a report showed that improper housing conditions led to frostbite on the tails of many monkeys.

In February 2012, the company was cited after a monkey died after being entangled by an enrichment device.

In March 2012, the company was cited for housing a monkey in isolation for almost eight months.

====Deaths of lab monkeys due to hyperthermia====
The company was fined $31,500 for four violations of the Animal Welfare Act of 1966 after 13 cynomolgus monkeys died from hyperthermia in overheated rooms in September and October 2014. In July 2014, the company had transported monkeys to the facility without providing water or proper care and ignoring signs of weakness and distress. The company said it would add electronic temperature monitoring and alerts.

====Broken bone injuries in monkeys====
In November 2023, the company was fined $9,000 due to the injuries of six monkeys between 2018 and 2022, mostly broken bones due to poor handling. After the injuries, four monkeys were euthanized.

<text>Margaret Florence Herrick (September 27, 1902June 21, 1976), also known professionally as Margaret Gledhill, was an American librarian and the Executive Director of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In 1971, the Academy&#x27;s library was named the Margaret Herrick Library in her honor.

== Early life ==
She was born Margaret Buck in Spokane, Washington, to Nathan K. Buck, an attorney, and Adda M. Buck (née Morie).

In 1929, Herrick graduated from the University of Washington with a degree in library science.

== Career ==
In 1929, Herrick became head librarian at the Yakima Public Library in Yakima, Washington. She moved to Hollywood, California, with her husband and became the Academy&#x27;s first librarian. She served in that capacity until 1943, during the war, when she became the interim executive director of the Academy, replacing her husband. In 1945, she was offered the Executive Director position permanently and held that position until her retirement in January 1971.

In the mid-1960s, Herrick went on international tours to promote the tenth anniversary of the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. Between 1963 and 1968, she visited many international film institutions.

The Academy&#x27;s extensive library in Beverly Hills, California, of material on films is named in her honor.

=== Oscar moniker ===
Herrick is generally credited with naming the Academy Award an &quot;Oscar&quot;, declaring the statuettes &quot;looked just like my Uncle Oscar&quot;. However, others, including Academy President Bette Davis and Hollywood gossip columnist Sidney Skolsky, have claimed they invented the name.

Bette Davis said that the statue reminded her of her husband Harmon Nelson&#x27;s derrière. Nelson&#x27;s middle name was Oscar. However, Davis later relinquished this claim.

Columnist Sidney Skolsky, who had a syndicated column for over 50 years, referred to the nickname, &quot;Oscar,&quot; in his March 17, 1934, column, which is believed to be the first time the award was called the Oscar in print.

== Personal life ==
In 1931, Herrick married Donald Gledhill, an assistant to the executive secretary of the Academy. She and Gledhill divorced in 1945. She married Philip A. Herrick in 1946, and continued to use his name professionally following their divorce in 1951.

On June 21, 1976, Herrick died at the Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, California, after a lengthy illness.

<doc id="883885" wikidata="Q190593" url="?curid=883885" title="OCLC">
<text>OCLC, Inc., doing business as OCLC, is an American nonprofit cooperative organization &quot;that provides shared technology services, original research, and community programs for its membership and the library community at large&quot;. It was founded in 1967 as the Ohio College Library Center, then became the Online Computer Library Center as it expanded. In 2017, the name was formally changed to OCLC, Inc. OCLC and thousands of its member libraries cooperatively produce and maintain WorldCat, the largest online public access catalog in the world. OCLC is funded mainly by the fees that libraries pay (around $217.8 million annually in total ) for the many different services it offers. OCLC also maintains the Dewey Decimal Classification system.

== History ==
OCLC began in 1967, as the Ohio College Library Center, through a collaboration of university presidents, vice presidents, and library directors who wanted to create a cooperative, computerized network for libraries in the state of Ohio. The group first met on July 5, 1967, on the campus of Ohio State University to sign the articles of incorporation for the nonprofit organization and hired Frederick G. Kilgour, a former Yale University medical school librarian, as first executive director.

Kilgour and Ralph H. Parker, who was the head of libraries at the University of Missouri, had proposed the shared cataloging system in a 1965 report as consultants to the Committee of Librarians of the Ohio College Association. Kilgour and Parker wished to merge the latest information storage and retrieval system of the time, the computer, with the oldest, the library. They were inspired in part by the earlier Columbia–Harvard–Yale Medical Libraries Computerization Project, an attempt at shared automated printing of catalog cards. The plan was to merge the catalogs of Ohio libraries electronically through a computer network and database to streamline operations, control costs, and increase efficiency in library management, bringing libraries together cooperatively to best serve researchers and scholars. The first library to do online cataloging through OCLC was the Alden Library at Ohio University on August 26, 1971. This was the first online cataloging by any library worldwide.

Between 1967 and 1977, OCLC membership was limited to institutions in Ohio, but in 1978, a new governance structure was established that allowed institutions from other states to join. In 2002, the governance structure was again modified to accommodate participation from outside the United States.

As OCLC expanded services in the United States outside Ohio, it relied on establishing strategic partnerships with &quot;networks&quot;, organizations that provided training, support and marketing services. By 2008, there were 15 independent United States regional service providers. OCLC networks played a key role in OCLC governance, with networks electing delegates to serve on the OCLC Members Council. During 2008, OCLC commissioned two studies to look at distribution channels; at the same time, the council approved governance changes that had been recommended by the Board of Trustees severing the tie between the networks and governance. In early 2009, OCLC negotiated new contracts with the former networks and opened a centralized support center.

In July 2010, the company was sued by SkyRiver, a rival startup, in an antitrust suit. Library automation company Innovative Interfaces joined SkyRiver in the suit. The suit was dropped in March 2013, however, following the acquisition of SkyRiver by Innovative Interfaces.
Innovative Interfaces was bought by ExLibris in 2020, therefore passing OCLC as the dominant supplier of ILS services in the US (over 70% market share for academic libraries and over 50% for public libraries for ExLibris, versus OCLC&#x27;s 10% market share of both types of libraries in 2019).

In 2022, membership and governance expanded to include any institution with a subscription to one of many qualifying OCLC products (previously institutions qualified for membership by &quot;contributing intellectual content or participating in global resource or reference sharing&quot;), with the exception of for-profit organizations that are part of OCLC&#x27;s partner program. This change reflected OCLC&#x27;s expanding number of services due to its corporate acquisitions.

===Presidents===
The following people served successively as president of OCLC:
* 1967–1980: Frederick G. Kilgour
* 1980–1989: Rowland C. W. Brown
* 1989–1998: K. Wayne Smith
* 1998–2013: Jay Jordan
* 2013–present: Skip Prichard

==Services==

OCLC provides bibliographic, abstract and full-text information to anyone.

OCLC and its member libraries cooperatively produce and maintain WorldCat—the OCLC Online Union Catalog, the largest online public access catalog (OPAC) in the world. WorldCat has holding records from public and private libraries worldwide.

The Online Computer Library Center acquired the trademark and copyrights associated with the Dewey Decimal Classification System when it bought Forest Press in 1988. A browser for books with their Dewey Decimal Classifications was available until July 2013; it was replaced by the Classify Service.

Until August 2009, when it was sold to Backstage Library Works, OCLC owned a preservation microfilm and digitization operation called the OCLC Preservation Service Center, with its principal office in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

Starting in 1971, OCLC produced catalog cards for members alongside its shared online catalog; the company printed its last catalog cards on October 1, 2015.

, an around-the-clock reference service provided to users by a cooperative of participating global libraries, was acquired by Springshare from OCLC in 2019 and migrated to Springshare&#x27;s LibAnswers platform.

==Software==
OCLC commercially sells software, such as:
* CONTENTdm for managing digital collections
* Wise, an integrated library system and &quot;community engagement system&quot;
* WorldCat Discovery, a bibliographic discovery system that allows library patrons to use a single search interface to access an institution&#x27;s catalog, ebooks, database subscriptions and more
* WorldShare Management Services, an electronic resource management system
* cloudLibrary, a cloud-based software system through which libraries manage and lend electronic books, digital magazines, newspapers, comics, and streaming media 

==Research==
OCLC has been conducting research for the library community for more than 30 years. In accordance with its mission, OCLC makes its research outcomes known through various publications. These publications, including journal articles, reports, newsletters, and presentations, are available through the organization&#x27;s website.
* OCLC Publications – Research articles from various journals including &quot;The Code4Lib Journal&quot;, &quot;OCLC Research&quot;, &quot;Reference and User Services Quarterly&quot;, &quot;College &amp; Research Libraries News&quot;, &quot;Art Libraries Journal&quot;, and &quot;National Education Association Newsletter&quot;. The most recent publications are displayed first, and all archived resources, starting in 1970, are also available.
* Membership Reports – A number of significant reports on topics ranging from virtual reference in libraries to perceptions about library funding.
* Newsletters – Current and archived newsletters for the library and archive community.
* Presentations – Presentations from both guest speakers and OCLC research from conferences, webcasts, and other events. The presentations are organized into five categories: Conference presentations, Dewey presentations, Distinguished Seminar Series, Guest presentations, and Research staff presentations.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, OCLC participated in the REopening Archives, Libraries, and Museums (REALM) project funded by the IMLS to study the surface transmission risks of SARS-CoV-2 on common library and museum materials and surfaces, and published a series of reports.

==Advocacy==
Advocacy has been a part of OCLC&#x27;s mission since its founding in 1967. OCLC staff members meet and work regularly with library leaders, information professionals, researchers, entrepreneurs, political leaders, trustees, students and patrons to advocate &quot;advancing research, scholarship, education, community development, information access, and global cooperation&quot;.

WebJunction, which provides training services to librarians, is a division of OCLC funded by grants from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation beginning in 2003.

OCLC partnered with search engine providers in 2003 to advocate for libraries and share information across the Internet landscape. Google, Yahoo!, and Ask.com all collaborated with OCLC to make WorldCat records searchable through those search engines.

OCLC&#x27;s advocacy campaign &quot;Geek the Library&quot;, started in 2009, highlights the role of public libraries. The campaign, funded by a grant from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, uses a strategy based on the findings of the 2008 OCLC report, &quot;From Awareness to Funding: A study of library support in America&quot;.

Other past advocacy campaigns have focused on sharing the knowledge gained from library and information research. Such projects have included communities such as the Society of American Archivists, the Open Archives Initiative, the Institute for Museum and Library Services, the International Organization for Standardization, the National Information Standards Organization, the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Engineering Task Force, and Internet2. One of the most successful contributions to this effort was the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative, &quot;an open forum of libraries, archives, museums, technology organizations, and software companies who work together to develop interoperable online metadata standards that support a broad range of purposes and business models.&quot;

OCLC has collaborated with the Wikimedia Foundation and the Wikimedia volunteer community, through integrating library metadata with Wikimedia projects, hosting a Wikipedian in residence, and doing a national training program through WebJunction called &quot;Wikipedia + Libraries: Better Together&quot;.

==Online database: WorldCat==

OCLC&#x27;s WorldCat database is used by the general public and by librarians for cataloging and research. WorldCat is available to the public for searching via a subscription web-based service called FirstSearch, to which many libraries subscribe, as well as through the publicly available WorldCat.org.

==Identifiers and linked data==
OCLC assigns a unique control number (referred to as an &quot;OCN&quot; for &quot;OCLC Control Number&quot;) to each new bibliographic record in WorldCat. Numbers are assigned serially, and in mid-2013 over a billion OCNs had been created. In September 2013, the OCLC declared these numbers to be in the public domain, removing a perceived barrier to widespread use of OCNs outside OCLC itself. The control numbers link WorldCat&#x27;s records to local library system records by providing a common reference key for a record across libraries.

OCNs are particularly useful as identifiers for books and other bibliographic materials that do not have ISBNs (e.g., books published before 1970). OCNs are often used as identifiers for Wikipedia and Wikidata. In October 2013, it was reported that out of 29,673 instances of book infoboxes in Wikipedia, &quot;there were 23,304 ISBNs and 15,226 OCNs&quot;, and regarding Wikidata: &quot;of around 14 million Wikidata items, 28,741 were books. 5403 Wikidata items have an ISBN associated with them, and 12,262 have OCNs.&quot;

OCLC also runs the Virtual International Authority File (VIAF), an international name authority file, with oversight from the VIAF Council composed of representatives of institutions that contribute data to VIAF. VIAF numbers are broadly used as standard identifiers, including in Wikipedia.

==Company acquisitions==
OCLC acquired NetLibrary, a provider of electronic books and textbooks, in 2002 and sold it in 2010 to EBSCO Industries. OCLC owns 100% of the shares of OCLC PICA, a library automation systems and services company which has its headquarters in Leiden in the Netherlands and which was renamed &quot;OCLC&quot; at the end of 2007. In July 2006, the Research Libraries Group (RLG) merged with OCLC.

On January 11, 2008, OCLC announced that it had purchased EZproxy. It has also acquired OAIster. The process started in January 2009 and from October 31, 2009, OAIster records are freely available via WorldCat.org.

In 2013, OCLC acquired the Dutch library automation company HKA and its integrated library system Wise, which OCLC calls a &quot;community engagement system&quot; that &quot;combines the power of customer relationship management, marketing, and analytics with ILS functions&quot;. OCLC began offering Wise to libraries in the United States in 2019.

In January 2015, OCLC acquired Sustainable Collection Services (SCS). SCS offered consulting services based on analyzing library print collection data to help libraries manage and share materials. In 2017, OCLC acquired Relais International, a library interlibrary loan service provider based in Ottawa, Canada.

A more complete list of mergers and acquisitions is available on the OCLC website.

==Criticism==
In May 2008, OCLC was criticized by Jeffrey Beall for monopolistic practices, among other faults. Library blogger Rick Mason responded that although he thought Beall had some &quot;valid criticisms&quot; of OCLC, he demurred from some of Beall&#x27;s statements and warned readers to &quot;beware the hyperbole and the personal nature of his criticism, for they strongly overshadow that which is worth stating&quot;.

In November 2008, the Board of Directors of OCLC unilaterally issued a new Policy for Use and Transfer of WorldCat Records that would have required member libraries to include an OCLC policy note on their bibliographic records; the policy caused an uproar among librarian bloggers. Among those who protested the policy was the non-librarian activist Aaron Swartz, who believed the policy would threaten projects such as the Open Library, Zotero, and Wikipedia, and who started a petition to &quot;Stop the OCLC powergrab&quot;. Swartz&#x27;s petition garnered 858 signatures, but the details of his proposed actions went largely unheeded. Within a few months, the library community had forced OCLC to retract its policy and to create a Review Board to consult with member libraries more transparently. In August 2012, OCLC recommended that member libraries adopt the Open Data Commons Attribution (ODC-BY) license when sharing library catalog data, although some member libraries have explicit agreements with OCLC that they can publish catalog data using the CC0 Public Domain Dedication.

<doc id="883896" wikidata="Q140683" url="?curid=883896" title="John Kay (flying shuttle)">
<text>John Kay (17 June 1704 – c. 1779) was an English inventor whose most important creation was the flying shuttle, which was a key contribution to the Industrial Revolution. He is often confused with his namesake, who built the first &quot;spinning frame&quot;.

==Early life==
John Kay was born on 17 June 1704 in the Lancashire hamlet of Walmersley, just north of Bury. His yeoman farmer father, Robert, owned the &quot;Park&quot; estate in Walmersley, and John was born there. Robert died before John was born, leaving Park House to his eldest son. As Robert&#x27;s fifth son (out of ten children), John was bequeathed £40 (at age 21) and an education until the age of 14. His mother was responsible for educating him until she remarried.

===Apprenticeship===
He apprenticed with a hand-loom reed maker, but is said to have returned home within a month claiming to have mastered the business. He designed a metal substitute for the natural reed that proved popular enough for him to sell throughout England. After travelling the country, making and fitting wire reeds, he returned to Bury and, on 29 June 1725, both he and his brother, William, married Bury women. John&#x27;s wife was Anne Holte. His daughter Lettice was born in 1726, and his son Robert in 1728.

In Bury he continued to design improvements to textile machinery; in 1730 he patented a cording and twisting machine for worsted.

==The Flying Shuttle==
In 1733, he received a patent for his most revolutionary device: a &quot;wheeled shuttle&quot; for the hand loom. It greatly accelerated weaving, by allowing the shuttle carrying the weft to be passed through the warp threads faster and over a greater width of cloth. It was designed for the broad loom, for which it saved labour over the traditional process, needing only one operator per loom (before Kay&#x27;s improvements a second worker was needed to catch the shuttle).

Kay always called this invention a &quot;wheeled shuttle&quot;, but others used the name &quot;fly-shuttle&quot; (and later, &quot;flying shuttle&quot;) because of its continuous speed, especially when a young worker was using it in a narrow loom. The shuttle was described as travelling at &quot;a speed which cannot be imagined, so great that the shuttle can only be seen like a tiny cloud which disappears the same instant.&quot;

===Opposition===

In July 1733, Kay formed a partnership in Colchester, Essex to begin fly-shuttle manufacturing. No industrial unrest was anticipated, this being the first device of the modern era to significantly enhance productivity. But by September 1733 the Colchester weavers, were so concerned for their livelihoods that they petitioned the King to stop Kay&#x27;s inventions.

The flying shuttle was to create a particular imbalance by doubling weaving productivity without changing the rate at which thread could be spun, disrupting spinners and weavers alike.

Kay tried to promote the fly-shuttle in Bury, but could not convince the woollen manufacturers that it was sufficiently robust; he spent the next two years improving the technology, until it had several advantages over the device specified in the 1733 patent. This was to be one of his difficulties in the coming patent disputes.

In 1738 Kay went to Leeds, where his problem had become royalty collection (the annual licence fee was 15 Shillings per shuttle). He continued to invent, patenting some machines in the same year, though these were not taken up industrially.

===The Shuttle Club===
Kay (and, initially, his partners) launched numerous patent infringement lawsuits, but if any of these cases were successful, compensation was below the cost of prosecution. Rather than capitulate, the manufacturers formed &quot;the Shuttle Club&quot;, a syndicate which paid the costs of any member brought to court; their strategy of patent piracy and mutual indemnification nearly bankrupted Kay.

In 1745, he and Joseph Stell patented a machine for cloth ribbon weaving, which they anticipated might be worked by water wheel, but they were unable to advance their plans because of Kay&#x27;s legal costs. Impoverished and harassed, Kay was compelled to leave Leeds, and he returned to Bury. Also in 1745, John&#x27;s twelfth, and final, child, William, was born.

Kay remained inventive; in 1746 he was working on an efficient method of salt production, and designing improvements to spinning technology: but that made him unpopular among Bury spinners. Also, fly-shuttle use was becoming widespread in weaving, increasing cotton yarn demand and its price; and Kay was blamed.

==Life in France==
He had suffered violent treatment in England, but he did not leave the country on that account, but because of his inability to enforce (or profit from) his patent rights. Trudaine&#x27;s &quot;Bureau de Commerce&quot; was known to support textile innovations (and would later actively recruit immigrant inventors). Probably encouraged by the prospect of state support, in 1747, Kay left England for France (where he had never been before, and did not speak the language).

===State subsidy===
Kay went to Paris, and throughout 1747 negotiated with the French Government (in English) to sell them his technology.

Denied the huge lump sum he wanted, Kay finally agreed to 3,000 &quot;livres&quot; plus a pension of 2,500 &quot;livre&quot;, (annually from 1749) in exchange for his patent, and instruction in its use (to the manufactures of Normandy). He retained the sole rights to shuttle production in France, and brought three of his sons to Paris to make them. Although wary of entering the manufacturing provinces (because of his experiences with rioting weavers in England) he was prevailed upon to do so.

At one time, the French authorities may have discouraged his communication with England, but Kay wrote about the unanticipated use of his technology in England to the French government: &quot;My new shuttles are also used in England to make all sorts of narrow woollen goods, although their use could have been more perfect had the weavers consulted me&quot;.

The beginning of mechanisation in French textile production is traditionally dated to 1753, with the widespread adoption of the flying shuttle there. Most of these new shuttles were copies, not made by the Kays. John Kay unsuccessfully tried to enforce his manufacturing monopoly, and began to quarrel with the French authorities, briefly returning to England, in 1756 (it is said that he was in his Bury home in 1753 when it was vandalised by a mob, and that he narrowly escaped with his life, but this is probably a 19th-century tale based on earlier Colchester riots; Kay was probably in France throughout the early 1750s).

He found his prospects in England unimproved; by 1758 he was back in France, which became his adopted country, though he was to visit England at least twice more. In the winter of 1765/66 he appealed to the Royal Society of Arts to reward him for his inventions, and exhibited his card-making machine for them. The Society could find no-one who understood the shuttle, and there was a breakdown in correspondence, so that no award was ever made. He was in England again in 1773, but returned to France in 1774 having lost his pension (at aged 70).

===Old age===
His offer to teach pupils if the pension were restored was not taken up, and he spent his remaining years developing and building machines for cotton manufacturers in Sens and Troyes. Though he was busy with engineering and letter-writing until 1779, he received only 1,700 &quot;livres&quot; from the French state over these five years, reaching a state of penury in March 1778 before receiving his final advance (to develop yet more machinery).

His last known letter (8 June 1779) listed his latest achievements for the &quot;Intendant de Commerce&quot;, and proposed further inventions. But since these were never made, and no more is heard of the 75-year-old Kay, it is believed that he must have died later in 1779.

==Legacy==
In Bury, Kay has become a local hero: there are still several pubs named after him, as are the Kay Gardens. Bury town centre has William Venn Gough&#x27;s 1908 Memorial to John Kay (sculpture by John Cassidy). Planning began after a 1903 Bury public meeting launched a public subscription. 19th century efforts to acknowledge Kay achieved little, but by 1903 it was felt that Bury &quot;owed John Kay&#x27;s memory an &quot;, and that all Bury should contribute in restitution to &quot;that wonderfully ingenious and man&quot;.

John Kay&#x27;s son, Robert, stayed in Britain, and in 1760 developed the &quot;drop-box&quot;, which enabled looms to use multiple flying shuttles simultaneously, allowing multicolour wefts.

His son John (&quot;French Kay&quot;) had long resided with his father in France. In 1782 he provided an account of his father&#x27;s troubles to Richard Arkwright, who sought to highlight problems with patent defence in a parliamentary petition.

Ford Madox Brown portrayed Kay and his invention in a mural painting in Manchester Town Hall.

===Thomas Sutcliffe===
In the 1840s, one of Kay&#x27;s great-grandsons, Thomas Sutcliffe, campaigned to promote a Colchester heritage for Kay&#x27;s family. In 1846 he unsuccessfully sought a parliamentary grant for Kay&#x27;s descendants in compensation for his ancestor&#x27;s treatment in England. He was inaccurate in the details of his grandfather&#x27;s genealogy and story, and his &quot;Fanciful and Erroneous Statements&quot; were discredited by John Lord&#x27;s detailed examination of primary sources.

<text>Ecma International () is a nonprofit standards organization for information and communication systems. It acquired its current name in 1994, when the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) changed its name to reflect the organization&#x27;s global reach and activities. As a consequence, the name is no longer considered an acronym and no longer uses full capitalization.

The organization was founded in 1961 to standardize computer systems in Europe. Membership is open to large and small companies worldwide that produce, market, or develop computer or communication systems, and have interest and experience in the areas addressed by the group&#x27;s technical bodies. It is located in Geneva.

== Aims ==
Ecma aims to develop standards and technical reports to facilitate and standardize the use of information communication technology and consumer electronics; encourage the correct use of standards by influencing the environment in which they are applied; and publish these standards and reports in electronic and printed form. Ecma publications, including standards, can be freely copied by all interested parties without copyright restrictions. The development of standards and technical reports is done in co-operation with the appropriate national, European, and international organizations.

Unlike national standardization bodies, Ecma is a membership-based organization. It takes pride in the resulting &quot;business-like&quot; approach to standards, claimed to lead to better standards in less time, thanks to a less bureaucratic process focused on achieving results by consensus.

Ecma has actively contributed to worldwide standardization in information technology and telecommunications. More than 400 Ecma Standards and 100 Technical Reports have been published, more than of which have also been adopted as international standards and/or technical reports.

The memberlist of Ecma International is available on its website. Its members include IT companies, IT trade associations, universities, foundations and public institutions.

==Standards==

Ecma International is responsible for several standards, including:
* ECMA-6 – 7-bit Coded Character Set (based on ASCII), also approved as ISO/IEC 646
* ECMA-35 – Character Code Structure and Extension Techniques, also approved as ISO/IEC 2022
* ECMA-48 – Control Functions for Coded Character Sets, also approved as ISO/IEC 6429
* ECMA-107 – FAT12/FAT16 file system
* ECMA-119 – CD-ROM volume and filestructure (later known as ISO 9660)
* ECMA-130 – CD-ROM &quot;Yellow Book&quot; format
* ECMA-262 – ECMAScript Language Specification (based on JavaScript)
* ECMA-334 – C# Language Specification
* ECMA-335 – Common Language Infrastructure (CLI)
* ECMA-341 – Environmental design considerations for electronic products
* ECMA-363 – Universal 3D File Format
* ECMA-367 – Eiffel: Analysis, design and programming Language (See Eiffel programming language)
* ECMA-372 – C++/CLI Language Specification
* ECMA-376 – Office Open XML (later known as ISO/IEC 29500)
* ECMA-377 – Holographic Versatile Disc (HVD) Recordable Cartridges
* ECMA-378 – Read-Only Memory Holographic Versatile Disc (HVD-ROM)
* ECMA-388 – Open XML Paper Specification
* ECMA-402 – ECMAScript Internationalization API Specification
* ECMA-404 – JSON
* ECMA-408 – Dart language specification

===Java programming language===
Although Sun Microsystems submitted its Java programming language to Ecma, Sun subsequently withdrew the submission. Thus, Ecma is not responsible for the standardization of Java.

===Office Open XML formats===
Ecma is involved in the standardization of the Office Open XML format based on the XML office document formats by Microsoft. The Ecma Office Open XML maintenance process is performed by technical committee 45 (TC45).

==Technical committees==
The Ecma standards are governed through technical committees assigned to particular areas or topics, such as:

* TC39 – responsible for ECMAScript.
* TC45 – responsible for Office Open XML.
* TC53 – responsible for ECMAScript Modules for Embedded Systems.

==Eco declaration==
In Ecma International Standard 370, Ecma joined with the Scandinavian IT Eco Declaration organisation to put forward a guideline for informing consumers about the environmental practices of the manufacturers of ICT and consumer electronics products.

The IT Eco Declaration includes information on the environmental practices of the manufacturer as well as product features, such as environmentally conscious design, batteries, acoustic noise, electrical safety, energy consumption, chemical emissions, substances and materials included, and packaging. This makes it easy to compare different suppliers and their products, as they all present the environmental features of their products in the same way, through a common industry standard reporting form.

<doc id="883913" wikidata="Q7661293" url="?curid=883913" title="Symmes Purchase">
<text>The Symmes Purchase, also known as the Miami Purchase, was an area of land totaling roughly in what is now Hamilton, Butler, and Warren counties of southwestern Ohio, purchased by Judge John Cleves Symmes of New Jersey in 1788 from the Continental Congress.

==History==
In the 1780s, Benjamin Stites, a friend of Symmes, was visiting Limestone (now Maysville, Kentucky) and lost some of his horses to theft by Native Americans. Pursuing them through the wilderness of southwestern Ohio, he travelled as far north as Xenia, observing the fertility of the country in the process. He was so impressed with the region that he informed Symmes of its prospects upon his return. Symmes gathered a syndicate, known as the Miami Company, to buy the land. The original contract was for , but the company couldn&#x27;t afford to pay for the land, and paid for and received only in the southwest portion of the original tract. The land was ¢ per acre.

==Location==
The tract is bordered on the south by the Ohio River, on the west by the Great Miami River, and on the east by the Little Miami River. The northern boundary runs through Butler and Warren Counties about 25 miles north of the Ohio River. Sections of Todhunter and Garver Roads in Monroe, Monroe Road in Lebanon, and Oregonia Road in Turtlecreek Township run along the boundary.

==Survey==
Deeds in this area will refer to the &quot;Between the Miami Rivers Survey&quot;, &quot;M.Rs.&quot; or &quot;M.R.S.&quot; (M.R.S. is also used to describe the &quot;Miami River Survey&quot; a survey west of the Great Miami River).

Unfortunately, Symmes&#x27; men committed many errors while performing the survey, including using magnetic north rather than correcting for true north. Further, Symmes sold much land that he did not own, some as far north as Dayton, meaning that some early settlers found themselves squatters on the public domain. Symmes also sold some land that he did own more than once.

==Settlement==
Three settlements grew up in the area in 1788, all near the Ohio River: Losantiville, North Bend, and Columbia. Losantiville was renamed Cincinnati in 1789 by Arthur St. Clair, governor of the Northwest Territory. They were among the earliest settlements in Ohio and the Northwest Territory. In 1789, Fort Washington was built in the reserved portion of the Purchase to protect the fledgling settlements.

<doc id="883930" wikidata="Q5871222" url="?curid=883930" title="Public domain (land)">
<text>Public domain land is land controlled by a government that either legally belongs to the citizenry and cannot be sold or can be sold. Public domain land is managed by a public entity—such as a state, region, province or municipality—directly or by institutes or state companies. It is called dominio público (Spanish), domínio público (Portuguese), domaine public (French) or demanio pubblico (Italian).

== United States ==

In the United States, land is public domain if it has belonged to the federal government since the 13 original colonies bought from indigenous tribes or from other countries, and has not been dedicated to a specific use. For most of the nation&#x27;s early history, the federal government sought to promote settlement of the expanding frontier by deeding the public domain to states and private interests through the auspices of the United States General Land Office. The authority for this came under laws such as the Homestead Act, the Timber and Stone Act, and the Morrill Act.

Creation of the first public domain of the United States, the Northwest Territory, began an epoch in American political history. The government decided early to create new states from it, to add to the union in full equality to the original 13 states. Its subsequent expansion, the mode of its administration, legislation for its government, its relation to constitutional questions, the diplomacy and politics involved in its acquisition, its international boundary questions, the enactment of settlement laws, the attraction of immigrants and growth of population, internal improvements and increased facilities of transportation, the discovery of precious metals, and other topics of interest might be cited here in connection with the public domain.

===History===
During the American Revolutionary War, Congress spent vast sums and the nation was in debt. The government promised soldiers land in lieu of pay. After the Revolution, the new federal government owned all the public land except that within the 13 original colonies and a few non-original states. The land owned by the government was called The Public Domain. The Land Act of 1785 gave land warrants to the soldiers to fulfill the promise. The Act also allowed the Treasury Department to sell land in auctions to the highest bidders. A new surveying system was created. The first auction was held in D.C., but the land sold was in Ohio. Soldiers could not afford to travel to Ohio to see the land, and then back to D.C. for the auction. Soldiers sold their warrants, often too cheaply. The government sold 640 acres at a time, minimum. Small farmers could not afford the prices. Speculators bought the warrants, purchased land, and sold the land in smaller lots to small farmers, at a huge profit.

Later, the government lowered the minimum acres, and sold land on credit, and offered some free land. The government made more money this way by copying the speculators&#x27; method. The government gained other land in time. States were then carved out of the public domain. The government has sold or given away over one billion acres of land. 5 million land patents were granted. The Bureau of Land Management grew from the older United States General Land Office and now controls public domain land.

==Europe==
===Italy===
In Italian law, public domain (&quot;demanio&quot;) derives from Roman Law and then took on its modern form during defeudalisation. 
The Italian public domain is governed by the Italian Civil Code, article 822 and following. In Italy, &quot;public domain&quot; is not the same thing of &quot;public estate&quot;: if the second one can be sell or rent in any moment, the main characteristic of the assets forming the public domain is their inalienability and imprescriptibility. In particular, all citizens have the right to access and transit to and through the coastline, but they may not erect there any durable construction.

Italian public domain is divided in two categories: &quot;necessary domain&quot; and &quot;incidental domain&quot;.
The necessary domain includes the whole coastline, roadsteads, ports, rivers, lakes, acquifers, other specific water bodies and all the works necessary for national defence purposes.
The accidental domain includes railways, streets, monuments and libraries, but only if they belong to the State.

Local authorities may also own public domain, and in this case we speak about &quot;regional&quot; or &quot;municipality domain&quot;. 

Private individuals are allowed to take advantage of Italian public domain only behind specific concessions, which are always time-limited, are awarded through public tenders and involve the payment of a fee.

<text>or are English conversation schools, usually privately operated, in Japan. It is a combination of the word and or .

Although the Japanese public education system mandates that English be taught as part of the curriculum from the fifth grade, the focus is generally on English grammar. Some students attend &quot;eikaiwa&quot; schools to supplement their school studies, to study a second language, to improve their business skills, as a hobby, to help socialize, or to prepare for travel or marriage. Many parents send their children to these schools in the hope of improving their child&#x27;s prospects for higher education, or to provide exposure to the ways and manners of people from other cultures. Contracted foreign teachers are often the principal selling point of an eikaiwa business.

==Schools==
The major chains of commercial language schools have branches in cities and towns throughout Japan, and there are large numbers of smaller independent outfits. Several chains offer instruction in other languages, including Spanish, French, Italian, German, Chinese, and Korean. These languages are taught primarily at larger city branches or through videoconferencing. In 2002, foreign language instruction in Japan was a 670 billion yen industry, of which the five largest chains (Nova, GEOS, ECC, Aeon, and Berlitz) accounted for 25%. Nova, the biggest, filed for bankruptcy in October 2007, although the brand continues to thrive under different management. Berlitz was once considered one of the &quot;Big Four&quot;, but its market share has declined in recent years and it was overtaken by ECC. ECC and Aeon have become the most widely recognized such schools in Japan. The large chains run extensive advertising campaigns in print and on television; they sometimes feature Japanese or international celebrities in their promotions and have a very high profile and strong brand recognition often built on the personal and professional qualities of the foreign staff currently contracted to work for them.

A 2008 assessment of the language study market for fiscal year 2007 showed it had shrunk by over 61%, an effect of Nova&#x27;s collapse, although demand for some services like software and lessons for children had increased. GEOS filed for bankruptcy in April 2010, and was acquired by Nova. 

Average salaries for eikaiwa teachers have generally fallen since the 1980s. Eikaiwa teachers&#x27; unions have attempted to combat the decline in pay and benefits, with mixed results.

==Staff==
&quot;Eikaiwa&quot; teachers are generally native English speakers from the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Ireland, or New Zealand. According to &quot;The Japan Times&quot;, the Ministry of Justice estimated that some 90 percent of foreign residents in Japan stayed for three years or less in 2005. For eikaiwa teachers, however, that figure rose to between 96 and 97 percent.
==Scandals==
The American Club, once the largest school in Tochigi Prefecture, north of Tokyo, was sued twice by its employees in the space of 13 months for withheld wages in the 1990s. During the second lawsuit its directors fled, while ignoring a court order to pay. News reports indicated the business was closed, but according to its business registration it is still a legal operating entity with 30 million yen in equity, and has never been in a state of bankruptcy.

The collapse of the troubled Nova chain in 2007 left thousands of western foreigners with no source of income and, in the majority of cases, no accommodation after their contracts were abruptly cancelled.

In 2014, Eikaiwa chain Gaba, famous for its &quot;man-to-man&quot; (one-to-one) lessons, came under fire from local print media for its handling of sexual harassment complaints against students. In the absence of a grievance procedure, the Gaba branch of the General Union had to resort to collective bargaining to resolve at least one dispute.

<doc id="883942" wikidata="Q1665764" url="?curid=883942" title="Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual">
<text>In computing, the Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual (ICCCM or I39L short for &quot;I&quot;, 39 letters and &quot;L&quot;) is a standard protocol for the X Window System. It specifies conventions for clients of a common X server about selections and cut buffers, communication with the window manager and session manager, manipulation of shared resources, and color characterization.

==History==

It was designed by David S. H. Rosenthal of the MIT X Consortium from 1987 to 1989.
A draft version appeared in March 1988 in X11R2.
This was removed from X11R3.
Version 1.0 was released in July 1989 as part of X11R4.
Three window managers in the X11R4 contrib directory implemented support for ICCCM: 
gwm, olwm and tekwm. 
Version 1.1 contains an update for color characterization and
appeared in X11R5.
Version 2.0 has many changes in the areas of window management,
selections, session management, and resource sharing.
It was released in May 1994 as part of X11R6.

==Background==

X deliberately specifies &quot;mechanism, not policy&quot; for how windows interact. As such, an additional specification beyond the X protocol itself was needed for client interoperation.

==Features==

The ICCCM specifies cut and paste buffers, window manager interaction, session management, how to manipulate shared resources and how to manage device colours. These low-level functions are generally implemented within widget toolkits or desktop environments. This isolates application programmers from working directly with the ICCCM itself, as this functionality is delegated to the implementing toolkit.

==Criticism==

The ICCCM has received some criticism for being ambiguous and difficult to implement correctly.

This was acknowledged in the preface of version 2.0, stating that it aimed
&quot;to fix problems with earlier drafts, and to improve readability and understandability&quot;.

Furthermore, some parts may be obsolete or no longer practical to implement.

The Extended Window Manager Hints (EWMH) is a more recent standard, which, according to its
introduction: &quot;builds on the ICCCM, which defines window manager interactions at a lower level.
The ICCCM does not provide ways to implement many features that modern desktop users expect.&quot;
But it also states: &quot;Clients which aim to fulfill this specification MUST adhere to the
ICCCM on which this specification builds.&quot; insofar the EWMH doesn&#x27;t overrule.

Freedesktop.org notes that
&quot;historically, X clients have not handled cut-and-paste in a consistent way&quot;
and formulates additional guidelines in a
clipboards-spec .

== List of Window Managers that are ICCCM Compliant ==
* aewm — a stacking window manager.
* alloywm — partial compliance.

<text>Honolulu is a city magazine covering Honolulu and the Hawaii region. It dates back to 1888 when it was called &quot;Paradise of the Pacific.&quot; It is the oldest magazine in the state of Hawaii and is the longest published magazine west of the Mississippi. &quot;Honolulu&quot; is a member of the City and Regional Magazine Association (CRMA).

==History==
In 1888, when Hawaii was still a monarchy, King Kalākaua commissioned a magazine under royal charter to be Hawaii&#x27;s ambassador to the world. That magazine was &quot;Paradise of the Pacific&quot;. For nearly a century, &quot;Paradise of the Pacific&quot; promoted local business and tourism by assuring citizens of the United States that the Islands were civilized. Noted contributors to &quot;Paradise of the Pacific&quot; included Henry B. Christian, Helen Thomas Dranga, Arman Manookian, and Edwin North McClellan.

In 1966, &quot;Paradise of the Pacific&quot; became &quot;Honolulu Magazine&quot;.

In 1977, David Pelligrin acquired it through his Honolulu Publishing Company and raised the bar for journalists in the islands. &quot;Honolulu&quot; shifted its focus to news and features aimed at an affluent residential audience. It covers dining, culture, arts, politics, entertainment in and around Honolulu and throughout Hawaii. &quot;Honolulu&quot; also has an annual dining awards called the Hale Aina Awards. Under Pelligrin in 1984, &quot;Honolulu&quot; established the awards as the islands’ first local restaurant awards. Before then, culinary awards in the Islands had only been given by mainland travel interests.

In 2001, Duane Kurisu, the owner of PacificBasin Communications, acquired the magazine from the Honolulu Publishing Company. The company also publishes &quot;Hawaii Business&quot;, &quot;Hawaii Home and Remodeling&quot;, &quot;Hawaii&quot;, &quot;Honolulu Family&quot;, &quot;Lei Chic&quot;, &quot;Whalers Village&quot; and &quot;Honolulu Shops Waikiki&quot;.

Since 2004, &quot;Honolulu&quot; has held a photo contest which asks people to submit photos they have taken of Hawaii throughout the previous year.

&quot;Honolulu&quot; also has an annual statewide fiction contest, though the last contest took place in 2006.

As of 2017, &quot;Honolulu&quot;&#x27;s owner, Duane Kurisu, who bought the magazines in 2001, also serves on the board of directors of Oahu Publications Inc.

<text>George Harvey Presnell (; September 14, 1933 – June 30, 2009) was an American actor and singer. He began his career in the mid-1950s as a classical baritone, singing with orchestras and opera companies throughout the United States.

His career reoriented away from classical music to musical theatre in 1960 after Meredith Willson cast him in a leading role in his new Broadway musical &quot;The Unsinkable Molly Brown&quot;. His portrayal of &quot;Leadville Johnny&quot; was a resounding success and he reprised the role in the 1964 film version of the musical, winning a Golden Globe Award for his portrayal.

Presnell went on to star in a few more films during the 1960s, but by the early 1970s that aspect of his career came to a standstill. From 1970 to 1995 he mostly worked as a musical theatre performer on Broadway, the West End, and in touring productions out of New York. In his early 60s, Presnell saw a resurgence in his movie career which lasted until his death. He played character roles in films like &quot;Fargo&quot; (1996), &quot;The Whole Wide World&quot; (1996), &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; (1998), and &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot; (2006). He also appeared on television as Mr. Parker in &quot;The Pretender&quot; and Lew Staziak in &quot;Andy Barker, P.I.&quot; He had recurring roles on &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; and &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;.

==Early life and classical singing career==
Presnell was born in 1933, in Modesto, California. He made his professional stage debut performing in an opera at the young age of sixteen. He attended the University of Southern California, earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree in vocal performance.

He then pursued further vocal studies in Europe and at the Music Academy of the West. He appeared with a number of opera companies and orchestras during the 1950s. In 1957 he made his debut with the San Francisco Opera as the Officer in Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot;.

He went on to sing several more comprimario roles with the company that year, including the Jailer in the United States premiere of Francis Poulenc&#x27;s &quot;Dialogues of the Carmelites&quot;. During the late 1950s he made several appearances and recordings with both the Roger Wagner Chorale and the Philadelphia Orchestra, the latter under the baton of Eugene Ormandy.

In 1956, Presnell co-starred with Herva Nelli in the American premiere of Darius Milhaud&#x27;s opera &quot;David&quot; at the Hollywood Bowl. In 1960, he was a featured soloist with the Los Angeles Philharmonic in another concert at the Bowl. In attendance at the concert was musical theater composer Meredith Willson who was at that time in the midst of creating his musical on the life of Molly Brown, &quot;Titanic&quot; survivor. Willson contacted him after the concert and asked him to audition for him. Presnell complied and Willson ended up offering him the role of &quot;Leadville Johnny.&quot; At this point the musical was not completed and Willson went on to compose much of the music for Leadville Johnny with Presnell&#x27;s voice in mind.
On November 3, 1960, &quot;The Unsinkable Molly Brown&quot; opened on Broadway at the Winter Garden Theatre to a resounding success. Presnell stayed with the show for its entire 532-performance run, which ended on February 10, 1962. He reprised the role in the 1964 film &quot;The Unsinkable Molly Brown&quot; for which he won a Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year.

He starred in two films in 1965: portraying Sol Rogers, a cavalry scout, in &quot;The Glory Guys&quot; and Danny Churchill, the romantic lead, in the musical film &quot;When the Boys Meet the Girls&quot;. He had one more sizable film role in the 1960s, the role of &quot;Rotten Luck Willie&quot; in Paramount&#x27;s 1969 musical Western film &quot;Paint Your Wagon&quot;, singing &quot;They Call the Wind Maria&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic opined that Presnell&#x27;s role &quot;delivered the golden opportunity to sing the unforgettable ballad.&quot; Theater reviewer Thomas Hischak wrote &quot;in one of the film&#x27;s few pleasing moments, Harve Presnell gave full voice to &quot;They Call the Wind Mariah&quot; and it was lovely to hear&quot;. Referring to Eastwood and Marvin, film reviewer Brian W. Fairbanks wrote that &quot;Harve Presnell steals both stars&#x27; thunder with a knockout version of the best song.&quot;

Presnell did some other film and television work in the 1960s and early 1970s, but for the next couple of decades concentrated primarily on stage work, playing Rhett Butler in the West End production of &quot;Scarlett&quot; and touring the United States as Daddy Warbucks in &quot;Annie&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Annie Warbucks&quot;, among other productions. In 1966, Presnell played the role of Sir Lancelot in &quot;Camelot&quot; in the Regional Equity production at The Houston Music Theatre.

In 1984, Presnell appeared as Don Quixote in &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; in Darien, Connecticut, an appearance well received by &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Alvin Klein, who wrote that Presnell was &quot;a winning leading man&quot;, and wrote:As an actor, Mr. Presnell promises much, and as a singer, he delivers. Here is one of the shiniest vocal accounts of the role yet. The actor is on the verge of suggesting that in his implausible way, the Don can bring a measure of grace to the world and fulfill that old impossible dream.

His film career was revived when he played William H. Macy&#x27;s testy father-in-law in &quot;Fargo&quot; (1996). Subsequent films included &quot;The Whole Wide World&quot; (1996), &quot;Larger than Life&quot; (1996), &quot;The Chamber&quot; (1996), &quot;Face/Off&quot; (1997), &quot;Julian Po&quot; (1997), &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; (1998, as General George Marshall), &quot;Patch Adams&quot; (1998), &quot;Walking Across Egypt&quot; (1999), &quot;The Legend of Bagger Vance&quot; (2000), &quot;The Family Man&quot; (2000), &quot;Escanaba in da Moonlight&quot; (2001), &quot;Mr. Deeds&quot; (2002), &quot;Super Sucker&quot; (2003), &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot; (2006), and &quot;Evan Almighty&quot; (2007).

On television, he appeared, in among other roles, as Mr. Parker on &quot;The Pretender&quot;, Dr. Sam Lane on &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;, and as A.I. Brooks on &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;.

==Recordings==
Presnell sang the baritone role in Eugene Ormandy&#x27;s 1960 recording of &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;, released by Columbia/Sony on LP and CD. His earliest recordings were as a soloist with the Roger Wagner Chorale (Capitol) in the 1950s with the Chorale in the background particularly in the LP &quot;Joy to the World&quot; where he sang in &quot;O Holy Night&quot; and the LPs &quot;Folk Songs of the New World&quot; [Capitol P8324 (1955)] and &quot;Folk Songs of the Frontier&quot; [Capitol P8332 (1956)], where he sang, among other songs, &quot;Bury Me Not on the Lone Prairie&quot; and &quot;Streets of Laredo&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Presnell&#x27;s second wife, Veeva Suzanne Hamblen, was the daughter of singer and actor Stuart Hamblen.

Presnell died on June 30, 2009, aged 75, from pancreatic cancer at Saint John&#x27;s Health Center in Santa Monica, California.

<doc id="883951" wikidata="Q1072716" url="?curid=883951" title="Mongolian spot">
<text>A Mongolian spot, also known as slate grey nevus or congenital dermal melanocytosis, is a benign, flat, congenital birthmark with wavy borders and an irregular shape. In 1883, it was described and named after Mongolians by Erwin Bälz, a German anthropologist based in Japan, who erroneously believed it to be most prevalent among his Mongolian patients. It normally disappears three to five years after birth and almost always by puberty. The most common color is blue, although they can be blue-gray, blue-black or deep brown.

== Cause ==
Mongolian spot is a congenital developmental condition—that is, one existing from birth—exclusively involving the skin. The blue colour is caused by melanocytes, melanin-containing cells, that are usually located in the surface of the skin (the epidermis), but are in the deeper region (the dermis) in the location of the spot. Usually, as multiple spots or one large patch, it covers one or more of the lumbosacral area (lower back), the buttocks, sides, and shoulders. It results from the entrapment of melanocytes in the lower half to two-thirds of the dermis during their migration from the neural crest to the epidermis during embryonic development.

Male and female infants are equally predisposed to slate grey nevus. People who are not aware of the background of the slate grey nevus may mistake them for bruises, possibly resulting in mistaken concerns about abuse.

=== Anthropological description ===
The French anthropologist interested himself in what he called the or coloured birthmark, publishing multiple papers in the , an academic journal covering the cultural anthropology of the Americas. Gessain spent time with the Huehuetla Tepehua people in Hidalgo, Mexico, and wrote in 1947 about the spot&#x27;s &quot;location, shape, colour, histology, chemistry, genetic transmission, and racial distribution&quot;. He had previously spent several winters in Greenland, and wrote an overview in 1953 of what was known about the spot. He hypothesised that the age at which it faded in various populations might prove to be a distinguishing characteristic of those groups. Gessain claimed that the spot was first observed amongst the Inuit.

Hans Egede Saabye, a Danish priest and botanist, spent 1770–1778 in Greenland. His diaries, published in 1816 and translated into several European languages, contained much ethnographic information. He described the spot on newborns, saying he had seen it often when the infants were presented naked for baptism. A second Danish observer was doctor and zoologist Daniel Frederik Eschricht, mainly based in Copenhagen. In 1849 he wrote of the &quot;mixed&quot; babies he had delivered at the lying-in hospital. He also says that &quot;the observation made for the first time by Saabye about Inuit children has been completely confirmed by Captain Holbøll&quot;, who sent him a fetus pickled in alcohol.

Gessain goes on to state that it was only in 1883 that an anthropologist mentions the spot. It was Erwin Bälz, a German working in Tokyo, who described a dark blue mark on Japanese infants. He presented his findings in 1901 in Berlin, and from that point on, Bälz&#x27;s name was associated with certain skin cells containing pigment. Captain Gustav Frederik Holm wrote in 1887 that his Greenlandic interpreter Johannes Hansen (known as Hanserak) attested to the existence of the birthmark over the kidney region of newborns, which grows larger as they grow older. That year, the Danish anthropologist Soren Hansen drew the connection between the observations of Bälz in Japan and Saabye in Greenland. &quot;This cannot be a coincidence. It is not the first time that the resemblance between the Japanese and the Eskimo has been pointed out.&quot; Fridtjof Nansen, the Norwegian polar explorer, said that the spot was widespread in the mixed Danish-Inuit population of West Greenland. Soren Hansen confirmed this. A missionary in Bethel, Alaska, a traditional gathering place of Yup&#x27;ik people, reported that the spots were common on children. Rudolf Trebitsch, an Austrian linguist and ethnologist, spent the summer of 1906 on the West Coast of Greenland, and listed all the examples he came across. Gessain went to north Labrador in 1926, looking for children with these spots. In 1953 Dr Saxtorph, medical advisor to the Greenland department (part of the Danish government), wrote that the Greenlanders do not like outsiders to see or discuss these birthmarks; &quot;they doubtless feel as a reminiscence of the time when they lived on a low cultural level&quot;.

The presence or absence of the slate grey nevus was used by racial theorists such as Joseph Deniker (1852–1918), the French anthropologist.

The &quot;Journal of Cutaneous Diseases Including Syphilis, Volume 23&quot; contained several accounts of the slate grey nevus on children in the Americas:

In Central America, according to these authorities, the spot is called &quot;Uits&quot;, &quot;pan&quot;, and it is an insult to speak of it. It disappears in the tenth month. It is bluish-reddish (in these Native people), and is remarkable by its small size. The mulberry colored spot is very well known in Afro-Brazilians. In Brazil, among individuals of mixed Indigenous American and West African descent (pardo) it is called &quot;genipapo&quot;, from its resemblance in color (bluish-gray) to an indigenous fruit of Brazil, named genipapo (a Native American word adopted into Portuguese).

== Prevalence ==
Infants may be born with one or more slate grey nevus ranging from a small area on the buttocks to a larger area on the back. The birthmark is prevalent among East, South, Southeast, North and Central Asian peoples, Indigenous Oceanians (chiefly Micronesians and Polynesians), certain populations in Africa, Amerindians, non-European Latin Americans and Caribbeans of mixed-race descent.

They occur in around 80% of Asians, and 80% to 85% of Native American infants. Approximately 90% of Polynesians and Micronesians are born with slate grey nevus, as are about 46% of children in Latin America, where they are associated with non-European descent. These spots also appear on 5–10% of babies of full Caucasian descent. African American babies have slate grey nevus at a frequencies of 90% to 96%.

According to a 2006 study examining the Mongolian spot among newborns in the Turkish city of İzmir, it was found out that 26% of the examined babies had the condition. It was noted the prevalence rate was 20% and 31% in boys and girls, respectively. The study also reported that no children born with light hair had the mark, meanwhile 47% of the children with dark hair having it.

In a study published in Hungary in 2013 a total of 2289 newborn infants underwent whole-body screening skin examinations. At least one skin manifestation was found in 63% of the neonates. The most frequently observed in pigmented lesions were congenital melanocytic naevi and Mongolian spot.

Since the last century, extensive research has been made regarding the prevalence of said spot in populations of mixed European-native American ancestry. A publication from 1905, citing field research made by the anthropologist Frederick Starr, states that the spot is not present in Mestizo populations; however, Starr&#x27;s actual research states that &quot;seven Mayan children presented the spot, three mixed children didn&#x27;t have it&quot;; Starr therefore does not make an absolute judgement, as he does not say how many mixed children were analyzed in total. Nowadays it is completely accepted that the big majority of Mexico&#x27;s and Latin America&#x27;s mixed-race populations have the Mongolian spot and that its presence works as an indicator of the actual degree of mestizaje present in a given population, having its lower frequency in Uruguay with 36%, followed by Argentina with an incidence 44%, Mexico with 50%-52%, 68% in Hispanic-Americans and 88% in highland Peruvians.

A study performed in hospitals of Mexico City suggests that socioeconomic factors influence the frequency of Mongolian spots among newborns, as evidenced by the higher prevalence of 85% in newborns from a public institution, typically associated with lower socioeconomic status, compared to a 33% prevalence in newborns from private hospitals, which generally cater to families with higher socioeconomic status. According to the Mexican Social Security Institute nationwide, around half of Mexican babies have the slate grey nevus.

Central American indigenous children were subjected to racism due to their slate grey nevus but progressive circles began to make having the slate grey nevus popular after the late 1960s. Highland Peruvians have the slate grey nevus.

== Treatment ==
As a congenital benign nevus, Mongolian spots do not require treatment and in most cases disappear before adolescence. No cases of malignant degeneration have been reported.

== Cultural terminology ==
The slate grey nevus is referred to in the Japanese idiom (), meaning &#x27;to have a blue butt&#x27;, which is a reference to immaturity or inexperience.

In the Mongolian language, it is known as , meaning &#x27;blue spot&#x27;.

Korean mythology explains the nevus as a bruise formed when Samshin halmi or Samsin Halmoni (), a shaman spirit to whom people pray around childbirth, slapped the baby&#x27;s behind to hasten the baby to quickly get out from the mother&#x27;s womb. &quot;Mongolian Mark&quot;, the middle third of the 2004–05 novel &quot;The Vegetarian&quot;, is named after the title character&#x27;s nevus, which obsesses her brother-in-law.

In Chinese, it is referred to as (pinyin: , ). Among common folk it is said to be caused by the Buddhist goddess of childbirth Songzi Guanyin (, pinyin: ; ) when she is slapping the baby&#x27;s backside, telling it to be born. Others say it is because the baby does not want to leave the mother&#x27;s womb, so Songzi Guanyin will kick it out, leaving the bruise. A small portion of people wrongfully believe it is caused when the doctor is slapping the baby&#x27;s backside to make it cry. Scientifically, it is also referred to as (; ).

In Khmer, it is known as () which translates to &#x27;Mongolian spot&#x27; as well as other skin conditions such as vitiligo and leucoderma.

In Spanish it is called and (see Erwin Bälz). The mark is common among Maya people of the Yucatan Peninsula where is referred to as in Maya, which means &#x27;circle&#x27;. In Ecuador, the native Indians of Colta are insultingly referred to in Spanish by a number of terms which allude to the slate grey nevus.

In Thai, it is known as () which translates to &#x27;ink bottom&#x27;, or (), which translates to &#x27;blue strain&#x27;. has been used to joke those who act, think or speak like a baby because this Mongolian spot can be seen only in this period of human being&#x27;s life.

In Iñupiaq, is it called or , which relates to the word for blood and also means &#x27;mole&#x27;.

<doc id="883953" wikidata="Q1154740" url="?curid=883953" title="Sprocket">
<text>A sprocket, sprocket-wheel or chainwheel is a profiled wheel with teeth that mesh with a chain, rack or other perforated or indented material. The name &#x27;sprocket&#x27; applies generally to any wheel upon which radial projections engage a chain passing over it. It is distinguished from a gear in that sprockets are never meshed together directly, and differs from a pulley in that sprockets have teeth and pulleys are smooth except for timing pulleys used with toothed belts.

Sprockets are used in bicycles, motorcycles, tracked vehicles, and other machinery either to transmit rotary motion between two shafts where gears are unsuitable or to impart linear motion to a track, tape etc. Perhaps the most common form of sprocket may be found in the bicycle, in which the pedal shaft carries a large sprocket-wheel, which drives a chain, which, in turn, drives a small sprocket on the axle of the rear wheel. Early automobiles were also largely driven by sprocket and chain mechanism, a practice largely copied from bicycles.

Sprockets are of various designs, a maximum of efficiency being claimed for each by its originator. Sprockets typically do not have a flange. Some sprockets used with timing belts have flanges to keep the timing belt centered. Sprockets and chains are also used for power transmission from one shaft to another where slippage is not admissible, sprocket chains being used instead of belts or ropes and sprocket-wheels instead of pulleys. They can be run at high speed and some forms of chain are so constructed as to be noiseless even at high speed.

== Usage ==
The term &#x27;sprocket&#x27; originally applied to the projection from the wheel that caught on the chain and provided the drive to it. The overall wheel was then termed a &#x27;sprocket wheel&#x27;. With time and common use of these devices, the overall wheel became known as a sprocket. The earlier uses would now be seen as archaic.

== Transportation ==
In the case of bicycle chains, it is possible to modify the overall gear ratio of the chain drive by varying the diameter (and therefore, the tooth count) of the sprockets on each side of the chain. This is the basis of derailleur gears. A multi-speed bicycle, by providing two or three different-sized driving sprockets and up to 12 (as of 2018) different-sized driven sprockets, allows up to 36 different gear ratios. The resulting lower gear ratios make the bike easier to pedal up hills while the higher gear ratios make the bike more powerful to pedal on flats and downhills. In a similar way, manually changing the sprockets on a motorcycle can change the characteristics of acceleration and top speed by modifying the final drive gear ratio. The final drive gear ratio can be calculated by dividing the number of teeth on the rear sprocket by the number of teeth on the counter-shaft sprocket. With respect to the stock gearing on a motorcycle, installing a smaller counter-shaft sprocket (fewer teeth), or a larger rear sprocket (more teeth), produces a lower gear ratio, which increases the acceleration of the motorcycle but decreases its top speed. Installing a larger counter-shaft sprocket, or a smaller rear sprocket, produces a higher gear ratio, which decreases the acceleration of the motorcycle but increases its top speed.

==Chain tracked vehicles==

In the case of vehicles with caterpillar tracks the engine-driven toothed-wheel transmitting motion to the tracks is known as the &quot;drive sprocket&quot; and may be positioned at the front or back of the vehicle, or in some cases both. There may also be a third sprocket, elevated, driving the track.

==Film and paper==

Sprockets are used in the film transport mechanisms of movie projectors and movie cameras. In this case, the sprocket wheels engage film perforations in the film stock. Sprocket feed was also used for punched tape and is used for paper feed to some computer printers.

<doc id="883959" wikidata="Q497487" url="?curid=883959" title="Heimssýn">
<text>Heimssýn (English: &quot;World View&quot;) is an organisation of Icelandic eurosceptics who actively campaign against Iceland becoming of a member of the European Union founded in June 2002. It was founded in June 2002. Ragnar Arnalds, former MP and Minister of Finance, served as chairman of the organisation from its foundation until 2009. The current chairman is Jón Bjarnason, former Member of the Althing and Minister of Agriculture, and the vice-chairman is Jóhanna María Sigmundsdóttir, Member of the Althing for the nationalist Progressive Party. The organization is sponsored by Bændasamtök Íslands, an agrarian lobby group of Icelandic farmers, and receives free advertising in their newspaper Bændablaðið.

== Criticism ==
Heimssýn has gained criticism for factual errors, false allegation and &quot;fear-mongering&quot; in their propaganda. The organization claimed in television adverts prominently featured in 2012 that accession to the European Union would be a direct eradication of Icelandic national identity, independence and lead to an unrecoverable loss of individual freedom. Such claims have been in their entirety dismissed by experts at the University of Iceland. When the current Icelandic government attempted to withdraw Iceland&#x27;s application for membership to the European Union, then party chairman and representative of the government Vigdis Hauksdottir defended the government&#x27;s decision by claiming that Europe was suffering from widespread famine and alleged that Malta could not be compared to Iceland when discussing membership as a result of it being a county within a larger country. Both of these allegations were condemned by members of the Icelandic intelligentsia and representatives of Unicef.

<doc id="883963" wikidata="Q2713545" url="?curid=883963" title="Hal Smith (actor)">
<text>Harold John Smith (August 24, 1916 – January 28, 1994) was an American actor. He is credited in over 300 film and television productions, and was best known for his role as Otis Campbell, the town drunk on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; and for voicing Owl and Winnie the Pooh (replacing Sterling Holloway) in the first four original &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; shorts (the first three of which were combined into the feature film &quot;The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot;) and later &quot;Winnie the Pooh Discovers the Seasons&quot;, &quot;Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore&quot; and in the television series, &quot;Welcome to Pooh Corner&quot; and &quot;The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot;. He also did a cameo in &quot;The Apartment&quot; as a drunken Santa Claus, and provided the voice of Goliath in the TV series &quot;Davey and Goliath&quot; from 1961 to 1965.

==Early life==
Harold John Smith was born on August 24, 1916, in Petoskey, Michigan to Jay D. Smith and Emma Smith (nee Ploof). He was the third of four children with two older sisters—Kathleen and Bernadeen—and one younger brother named Glenford, who was called &quot;Glen&quot;. His family moved to Wilmington, North Carolina when he was a child before settling in Massena, New York. After graduation from high school, in Massena, New York, Smith worked from 1936 to 1943 as a DJ and voice talent for WIBX Radio in Utica, New York.

Being an avid flyer, Smith enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces in 1943 and was stationed in the Philippines with the Army&#x27;s Special Services Division. While in Manila, he was made assistant manager of the enlisted men&#x27;s club at the Far East Air Force (FEAF) headquarters. As such, he was responsible for planning and directing shows for the entertainment of his fellow troops. His own performing skills were utilized as well in a show titled &quot;Strictly from Hunger&quot;. He was discharged from the service in 1946 as a Sergeant and was awarded the American Campaign Medal, the Asiatic–Pacific Campaign Medal, the World War II Victory Medal and the Philippine Liberation Medal.

==Career==
===Early roles===
After the war, he traveled to Hollywood in 1946 to pursue a career as an actor, he made his acting debut in the feature film, &quot;Stars Over Texas&quot; as Peddler Tucker. He would later appear in many television series throughout his later career, such as &quot;I Married Joan&quot;, &quot;Fury&quot;, &quot;The People&#x27;s Choice&quot;, &quot;The Texan&quot;, &quot;Rescue 8&quot;, &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot;, &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;, &quot;National Velvet&quot; and &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot;.

===&quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;===
Smith&#x27;s best-remembered on-screen character was Otis Campbell, the town drunk on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, during most of the series&#x27; run from 1960 to 1967. When intoxicated, he would often comically let himself into his regular jail cell—using the key which was stored within reach of the two comfortable jail rooms— and &quot;sleep off&quot; the effects of alcohol. Deputy Barney Fife would often become irritated with Otis and would attempt to either sober him up or rehabilitate him in several episodes.

Hal Smith was the opposite of his character. According to longtime friends Andy Griffith and Don Knotts, he did not drink in real life. Smith, however, in a 1964 interview with his hometown paper, said he was a “social drinker.” The Otis character stopped appearing in the sitcom towards the end of the series because of sponsor concerns regarding the comic portrayal of excessive drinking. Smith appeared as Calver Weems in the Don Knotts comedy &quot;The Ghost and Mr. Chicken&quot; (1966), playing essentially the same town drunk character.

Smith would play Otis one more time in the television movie &quot;Return to Mayberry&quot; (1986). In the television movie, Otis is the town&#x27;s ice cream truck driver and is reported to have been &quot;sober for years.” Smith later used his Otis Campbell character in commercial spots for the Mothers Against Drunk Driving organization, and he appeared as Otis in Alan Jackson&#x27;s music video &quot;Don&#x27;t Rock the Juke Box.”

===Other performances===
In 1957, Smith played Rollin Daggett in the role of a newspaper man in the early days of Mark Twain in the &quot;Fifteen Paces to Fame&quot; episode of Death Valley Days. He made at least one appearance in the TV series &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, the episode titled &quot;The Case of the Treacherous Toupee&quot;, (season 4, episode 1), in 1960.

Though his character was never seen drinking or drunk, by the end of the episode, he makes an oath to himself to stop drinking and reform.

In the mid-1960s, Smith also had a morning children&#x27;s show on the Los Angeles television station KHJ called &quot;The Pancake Man&quot;, sponsored by the International House of Pancakes (IHOP) restaurant chain. He reprised the role of the Pancake Man as &quot;Kartoon King&quot; in the 1971 episode of &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;, titled &quot;The Winner&quot;.

Smith also worked extensively as a voice actor in animated films and television series. His first voice credit was as &quot;Pepe&quot;, a boxing rooster, in Walter Lantz&#x27;s cartoon &quot;The Bongo Punch&quot; in 1957.
Beginning in the late 1950s with such shows as &quot;The Huckleberry Hound Show&quot; and &quot;Quick Draw McGraw&quot;, Smith became one of the most prolific voice actors in Hollywood, eventually working with most of the major studios and production companies, such as Hanna-Barbera, Walt Disney, Warner Bros., the Mirisch Corporation, and Sid and Marty Krofft, with voice roles on such series as &quot;The Flintstones&quot; in which he mostly did the voices of Texas millionaires such as Fred&#x27;s rich uncle Tex, &quot;Pink Panther&quot;, &quot;The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot;, &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot;, &quot;Yogi Bear&quot; and &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;.

In 1962, he voiced Taurus, the Scots-accented mechanic of the spaceship &quot;Starduster&quot; for the series &quot;Space Angel&quot;. According to the book: &quot;Space Patrol, missions of daring in the name of early television&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s rumored that Gene Roddenberry was a huge fan of the show and patterned &quot;Star Trek&#x27;s&quot; engineer, Mr. Scott, after McCloud&#x27;s Scottish sidekick, Taurus&quot;. He also did voices for the &quot;Hong Kong Phooey&quot; series. In 1977, he was the voice of Grandpa Josiah in the cartoon special, &quot;Halloween Is Grinch Night&quot;. That same year, he began voicing the Disney character Winnie the Pooh, replacing Sterling Holloway, who had provided the voice of the character for many years, beginning with the Disney Read-Along adaptation of &quot;Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too&quot;. He was also very active with doing voices in 1980s; he was Sludge in &quot;The Smurfs&quot;, Goofy in &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;, in Disney&#x27;s &quot;DuckTales&quot; he did the voices of Scrooge McDuck&#x27;s rival Flintheart Glomgold and the absent-minded scientist Gyro Gearloose and in &quot;Frog And Toad are Friends&quot; and &quot;Frog And Toad Together&quot; he also did the voice of Toad.

Smith also voiced the Disney cartoon character Goofy after Pinto Colvig died in 1967 and would voice him up until &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; in 1983. Additionally, he provided the voice of Owl in the two original &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; featurettes (&quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree&quot; and &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day&quot;) and &quot;The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot; in 1977. In the 1960s, he was one of the most sought after voice actors in Hollywood. From 1959 till 1975, he provided the voices for Goliath, Davey&#x27;s dad and many other characters in &quot;Davey and Goliath&quot;. From 1960 to 1961, he was the voice of Elmer Fudd after Arthur Q. Bryan died. In 1963, he voiced Dr. Todd Goodheart, Belly Laguna, and Dr. Von Upp in The Funny Company cartoon series. From 1964 to 1966, he was the voice of Yappee in the Hanna-Barbera cartoon shorts &quot;Yippee, Yappee and Yahooey&quot;. He was also the voice of Cosgoode Creeps, Asa Shanks, the Farmer and Mr. Greenway, on &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where are You!&quot;.

In 1981, he reprised his role as Owl and Winnie the Pooh in the short &quot;Winnie the Pooh Discovers the Seasons&quot;. He then voiced the two characters in &quot;Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore&quot; in 1983, as well as Disney Channel&#x27;s television series &quot;Welcome to Pooh Corner&quot;. On the television series &quot;The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot; in 1988, Jim Cummings took over as Pooh while Smith continued playing Owl. The two voice actors sometimes rotated the voice of Winnie the Pooh. In 1991, Smith provided the voice of Philippe the Horse in the Disney film &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; before his death in 1994.

In 1985, Hal voiced Norman Harper, a sick father of wife Jennifer Walters (voiced by D.J. Harner), in a radio drama entitled &quot;House Guest&quot;. It aired on the Focus on the Family daily broadcast on November 23 (the day before Thanksgiving) of that year. He went to voice other roles for other Focus audio presentations, and starting in 1987, Smith was the voice of the main character John Avery Whittaker on Focus on the Family&#x27;s longest-running radio drama &quot;Adventures in Odyssey&quot;, which debuted that year. He was responsible for much of the cast joining the show after he signed on (including Katie Leigh, Will Ryan, Walker Edmiston, Earl Boen, Dave Madden and others), and he continued recording episodes until a few weeks before his death, even while his health deteriorated. In an Andy Griffith Fan Interview, published after he died, Smith said that &quot;Adventures in Odyssey&quot; was one of the most gratifying things he had done in his life. Additionally, he voiced dozens of other characters during the 253 episodes in which he participated. His role of Whit was later filled by Paul Herlinger in 1996 and then Andre Stojka in 2009, after his death.

Hal voiced Joe McGee in &quot;The Old Man and the Sea Duck&quot; episode of &quot;TaleSpin&quot;.

Smith was also very active working in television commercials as various characters.

==Death==
After his wife died in 1992, Smith&#x27;s own health began to deteriorate rapidly. On January 28, 1994, at the age of 77, Smith died from an apparent heart attack. Don Pitts, his longtime agent, said that Smith died at his home in Santa Monica, California, while he was listening to a nightly drama hour on radio.

<text>Daniel Vincent Gallery (July 10, 1901 – January 16, 1977) was a rear admiral in the United States Navy. He saw extensive action during World War II, fighting U-boats during the Battle of the Atlantic, where his most notable achievement was the June 4, 1944 capture of the . After the war, Gallery was a prolific author of fiction and non-fiction. During the post-war military cutbacks, he wrote a series of articles criticizing the heavy reductions being made to the US Navy. These articles placed him at odds with the administration during the episode which became known as the Revolt of the Admirals.

==Early life and career==
Daniel was the son of Daniel Vincent Gallery (born Chicago, July 19, 1865), lawyer, and Mary Onahan Gallery, writer. In 1917, at the age of 16, Gallery entered the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland. He graduated a year early, in 1920, and competed in the 1920 Olympics in Antwerp on the U.S. wrestling team.

He had three younger brothers, all of whom had careers in the U.S. Navy. Two brothers, William O. Gallery and Philip D. Gallery, also rose to the rank of rear admiral. The fourth brother, John Ireland Gallery, was a Catholic priest and Navy chaplain. Their grandfather Daniel, born about 1839, emigrated to the U.S. from Ennistymon, County Clare, Ireland, in the mid- to late- 1800s.

Gallery was an early naval aviator. He flew seaplanes, torpedo bombers and amphibians. In the late 1930s, he won at the National Air Races in a race-tuned Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo plane. In 1941, while the U.S. was still neutral, he was assigned as the Naval Attaché at the U.S. Embassy in Great Britain. While in Britain, he earned his flight pay by ferrying Supermarine Spitfires from the factory to Royal Air Force aerodromes. He liked to claim that he was the only U.S. Navy aviator who flew Spitfires during the Battle of Britain, but they were unarmed.

==World War II==
In 1942, Gallery took command of the Fleet Air Base in Reykjavík, Iceland, where he was awarded the Bronze Star for his actions against German submarines. It was there that he conceived his plan to capture a U-boat.

In 1943, Gallery was named captain of the escort carrier , which he commissioned. In January 1944, he commanded antisubmarine Task Group 21.12 (TG 21.12) out of Norfolk, Virginia, with &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; as the flagship. TG 21.12 sank the .

In March 1944, Task Group 22.3 was formed with &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; as the flagship. On this cruise, Gallery pioneered 24-hour flight operations from escort carriers in order to hunt U-boats, which had begun remaining submerged during daylight to avoid carrier-based aircraft. On April 9, the task group sank , commanded by U-boat ace &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Werner Henke. After prolonged depth charging, the submarine was forced to the surface among the attacking ships and the surviving crew abandoned ship. The deserted &quot;U-515&quot; was hammered by rockets and gunfire before she finally sank. Gallery saw that this would have been a perfect opportunity to capture the vessel. He decided to be ready the next time such an opportunity presented itself. The next night, aircraft from the task group caught on the surface, in broad moonlight, and sank her with one survivor, a lookout caught on-deck when the U-boat crash dived.

===&quot;U-505&quot;===
On the next cruise of TG 22.3, Gallery took the unusual step of forming boarding parties, in case of another chance to capture a U-boat arose. On June 4, 1944, the task group crossed paths with &quot;U-505&quot; off the coast of Africa. &quot;U-505&quot; was spotted running on the surface by two Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters from &quot;Guadalcanal&quot;. Her captain, &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; Harald Lange, dived the boat to avoid the fighters. But they could see the submerged submarine and vectored destroyers onto her track. The experienced antisubmarine warfare team laid down patterns of depth charges that shook &quot;U-505&quot; up badly, popping relief valves and breaking gaskets, resulting in water sprays in her engine room. Based on reports from the engine room, the captain believed his boat to be heavily damaged and ordered the crew to abandon ship, which was done so hastily that full scuttling measures were not completed.
Gallery ordered the boarding party from the destroyer escort to board the foundering submarine and if possible capture her. The destroyers in range used their .50 caliber and 20 mm antiaircraft guns to chase the Germans off the vessel so the boarding party could get onto her. Once on board, the party replaced the cover of the sea strainer, thus keeping the U-boat from sinking immediately. The boarders retrieved the submarine&#x27;s Enigma coding machine and code books. (This was a primary goal of the mission because it would enable the codebreakers in Tenth Fleet to read German signals immediately, without having to break the codes). They got her under control, and &quot;U-505&quot; became the first foreign captured in battle on the high seas by the U.S. Navy since the War of 1812.

This incident was the last time that the order &quot;Away All Boarders!&quot; was given by a U.S. Navy captain. Lieutenant Albert David, who led the boarding party, received the Medal of Honor for his courage in boarding a foundering submarine that presumably had scuttling charges set to explode – the only Medal of Honor awarded in the Atlantic Fleet during World War II. For capturing &quot;U-505&quot;, Task Group 22.3 was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation and Gallery received the Distinguished Service Medal.

He also received a blistering dressing-down from Admiral Ernest J. King, Chief of Naval Operations. King pointed out that unless &quot;U-505&quot;″s capture could be kept an absolute secret, the Germans would change their codes and change out the cipher wheels in the Enigma. Gallery managed to impress his crews with the vital importance of maintaining silence on the best sea story any of them would ever see. His success kept him from getting a court-martial instead of a medal. (Two noted naval historians, Samuel Eliot Morison and Clay Blair, Jr., take opposite views of Gallery&#x27;s case. Morison saw it as an intrepid act of combat valor in the finest Navy tradition; Blair sided with Admiral King and called it an act of lunacy which could have undone all the work done by the codebreakers on both sides of the Atlantic.) After the war, King personally approved the award of the Presidential Unit Citation to Task Group 22.3 for the capture of the U-boat.

===Later war===
Gallery was given command of the aircraft carrier in September 1945. He relinquished command of &quot;Hancock&quot; on 10 December 1945.

==Post-World War II service==
After promotion to rear admiral, Gallery became Assistant to the Chief of Naval Operations. He commanded Carrier Division Six during the Korean War.

===The &quot;Revolt of the Admirals&quot;===
The &quot;Revolt of the Admirals&quot; occurred during Louis Johnson&#x27;s tenure as Secretary of Defense. Johnson planned to scrap the carrier fleet, merge the Marine Corps into the Army, and reduce the Navy to a convoy-escort force. Gallery wrote a series of articles for &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; fiercely criticizing these plans. The final article, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Them Scuttle the Navy!&quot; was so inflammatory that Gallery barely escaped court-martial for insubordination. It cost Gallery his third star. It effectively finished his career, though he served 12 more years on active duty. At the time of his retirement, he was second in seniority on the Rear Admirals&#x27; List.

===Command of the Tenth Naval District===
Gallery&#x27;s final command was the Tenth Naval District in San Juan, Puerto Rico, from December 1956 to July 1960. During this command, with the help of the Rotary and Lions clubs, he established the first Little Leagues in Puerto Rico. It was also there that he first heard the steel bands of Trinidad. He was so taken by the sound that he invested $120 in steel drums for his command&#x27;s Navy band. He established the first all-American and the only military steel band in 1957. The Tenth Naval District Steel Band – or Admiral Dan&#x27;s Pandemoniacs, as they called themselves – became the U.S. Navy Steel Band and toured the world as ambassadors of the U.S. Navy until 1999.

Gallery was forced to retire from the Navy in 1960 when he was found medically unfit for service. Shortly before Gallery&#x27;s retirement, the custom of &quot;tombstone promotion&quot; was abolished. So he was one of the few rear admirals of his era to be retired as only a rear admiral. Most of his contemporaries retired as vice admirals.

He died at the Bethesda Naval Medical Center on January 16, 1977, at the age of 75. He was buried with full military honors in Section 3 of Arlington National Cemetery, adjacent to two of his brothers.

==Quotations by Daniel V. Gallery==
*&quot;The definition of a calculated risk is a gamble which military men take when they can&#x27;t figure out what else to do and which turns out to be right. When it turns out wrong, it wasn&#x27;t a calculated risk at all. It was a piece of utter stupidity.&quot;
*&quot;Some critics have accused the military of being profligate wastrels because we didn&#x27;t win World War II by killing the last Jap with the last bullet we had in our ammo locker. I would much rather defend myself against such charges than try to explain to my three kids why we lost our liberties because military planners didn&#x27;t want the war to end with a lot of surplus junk on our hands.&quot;
*&quot;When nations, by mutual consent, decide to ignore the commandment &#x27;Thou shall not kill&#x27;, it is very difficult for the military leaders to restrict the killing to just the right people.&quot;

<doc id="883979" wikidata="Q7647630" url="?curid=883979" title="Susan Buffett">
<text>Susan Thompson Buffett (June 15, 1932 – July 29, 2004) was an American activist for the causes of civil rights, abortion rights and birth control, and the first wife of investor Warren Buffett. She was a director of Berkshire Hathaway, owning 2.2 percent of the company worth about $3 billion at the time of her death, making her the 153rd richest person in the world. She was president of the Buffett Foundation, which has contributed millions of dollars to educational groups, medical research, family planning groups and other charities.

==Biography==
Susan was born in Omaha, Nebraska, and graduated from Omaha Central High School. Her father, William Hertzog Thompson, was a minister, psychologist, dean at the University of Nebraska-Omaha, and one-time campaign manager for Howard Buffett.

Though her parents and Warren&#x27;s knew one another, they met at Northwestern University, via Susan&#x27;s roommate Roberta Buffett, Warren&#x27;s sister.

Susan and Warren married in 1952 at the Dundee Presbyterian Church in Omaha. They had three children together: Susan (born July 30, 1953), Howard (born December 16, 1954), and Peter (born May 4, 1958).

Allegations have been made regarding Susan&#x27;s conduct during her marriage to Warren. These include claims that in the mistaken belief her husband had cheated on her with his friend, Katharine Graham, she sent Graham a passive-aggressive letter that &quot;let her date Warren Buffett&quot;, and that she had a relationship with her tennis coach, John McCabe.

She occasionally performed hit classics from the early 1970s cabaret singer and, in 1977, had a one-night performance at an Omaha theater. Encouraged by songwriter/musician Neil Sedaka to pursue a singing career, she left her husband and moved to a small apartment in San Francisco with her paramour, John McCabe, in Gramercy Tower on Nob Hill. Later, she moved into a large condominium on Broadway near Scott Street in Pacific Heights with views of the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz. She remained married and on good terms with her husband, vacationing together with him and spending time assisting charitable groups. She performed in New York and released several CDs. According to Roger Lowenstein&#x27;s 1995 Random House biography, &quot;Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist&quot;, while Warren had encouraged Susan to pursue her career in music, he was heartbroken by her move.

In 1978, Susan introduced her husband to Astrid Menks, who moved in with Warren in their Omaha home, and married him after Susan&#x27;s death.

The Buffetts attended public functions as husband and wife though they had not lived together for more than half of their marriage. The Buffetts even signed Christmas cards, Warren, Susan, and Astrid, and were often seen together as a trio.

==Later Life==
In October 2003, Susan was diagnosed with oral cancer; she underwent surgery, radiation therapy and facial reconstruction. Warren flew out from Omaha to be with her every weekend during her recovery and the couple would later contribute $6 million to five California doctors for the study of oral cancer. She had recovered enough to attend the annual shareholders&#x27; meeting of Berkshire Hathaway in May 2004, leading a singalong at the Borsheim&#x27;s reception.

Susan died at the age of 72 after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage during the summer of 2004 in Cody, Wyoming. Bono performed &quot;Forever Young&quot; and &quot;All I Want Is You&quot; at her funeral. Warren was so grief-stricken that he did not attend. She left approximately $50 million to her children&#x27;s charity while each of her children received $10 million and each grandchild received $100,000. She also left a number of friends and employees substantial sums, including $8 million to John McCabe and $1 million to Ron Parks. Nearly all of her Berkshire Hathaway shares, valued at nearly $3 billion at the time, were left to a foundation that would later bear her name.

<text>The Jeremiah Morrow Bridge is the name for a pair of concrete box girder bridges built between 2010 and 2016 which carry Interstate 71 over the Little Miami River gorge between Fort Ancient and Oregonia, Ohio. The bridges are named for former Governor of Ohio Jeremiah Morrow.

The bridges are 239 feet (73 m) above the river, making them the highest bridges in Ohio, and are long, wide, with main spans. The bridges each have two marked lanes with room for a third lane.

The original Warren truss bridges at the same location were opened to traffic in 1965 and were continuous across five spans. Both of the original spans were replaced beginning in 2010, with the completion of construction work marked with an official ribbon cutting ceremony held on November 18, 2016.

The original bridges were approximately the same design and age as the I-35W Mississippi River bridge which collapsed in 2007. Demolition of the original southbound bridge was largely completed on April 23, 2017. The original northbound bridge had been demolished in 2014 after one of the new bridges was complete.

<doc id="883983" wikidata="Q14943923" url="?curid=883983" title="Network operations center">
<text>A network operations center (NOC, pronounced like the word &quot;knock&quot;), also known as a &quot;network management center&quot;, is one or more locations from which network monitoring and control, or network management, is exercised over a computer, telecommunication or satellite network.
==History==
The earliest NOCs started during the 1960s. A Network Control Center was opened in New York by AT&amp;T in 1962 which used status boards to display switch and routing information, in real-time, from AT&amp;T&#x27;s most important toll switches. AT&amp;T later replaced this Network Control Center with a modernized NOC in 1977, located in Bedminster, New Jersey.

==Purpose==
NOCs are implemented by business organizations, public utilities, universities, and government agencies that oversee complex networking environments that require high availability. NOC personnel are responsible for monitoring one or many networks for certain conditions that may require special attention to avoid degraded service. Organizations may operate more than one NOC, either to manage different networks or to provide geographic redundancy in the event of one site becoming unavailable.

In addition to monitoring internal and external networks of related infrastructure, NOCs can monitor social networks to get a head-start on disruptive events.

==Networking environments==

===Computer===
Computer environments can range in size from one to millions of servers.

===Telecommunication===
In telecommunication environments, NOCs are responsible for monitoring power failures, communication line alarms (such as bit errors, framing errors, line coding errors, and circuits down) and other performance issues that may affect the network, and in telecom sector have to track details about the call flow.

===Satellite===
Satellite network environments process large amounts of voice and video data, in addition to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance information. Example organizations that manage this form of NOC includes Artel, a service provider of commercial satellite bandwidth to the United States Department of Defense, located in Herndon, Virginia.

==Design==
NOCs are frequently laid out with several rows of desks, all facing a video wall, which typically shows details of highly significant alarms, ongoing incidents and general network performance; a corner of the wall is sometimes used for showing a news or weather TV channel, as this can keep the NOC technicians aware of current events which may affect the network or systems they are responsible for. The back wall of a NOC is sometimes glazed; there may be a room attached to this wall which is used by members of the team responsible for dealing with serious incidents to meet while still able to watch events unfolding within the NOC. Individual desks are generally assigned to a specific network, technology or area. A technician may have several computer monitors on their desk, with the extra monitors used for monitoring the systems or networks covered from that desk. The location housing a NOC may also contain many or all of the primary servers and other equipment essential to running the network, although it is not uncommon for a single NOC to monitor and control a number of geographically dispersed sites.

==Personnel==

===NOC engineers===
A NOC engineer has several duties in order to ensure the smooth running of the network. They deal with things such as DDoS attacks, power outages, network failures, and routing black-holes. There are of course the basic roles, such as remote hands, support, configuration of hardware (such as firewalls and routers, purchased by a client). NOC engineers also have to ensure the core network is stable. This can be done by configuring hardware in a way that makes the network more secure, but still has optimal performance. NOC engineers are also responsible for monitoring activity, such as network usage, temperatures etc. They would also have to install equipment, such as KVMs, rack installation, IP-PDU setup, running cabling. The majority of NOC engineers are also on call and have a five or six day rotation, working different shifts.

<doc id="883993" wikidata="Q466946" url="?curid=883993" title="Tina Modotti">
<text>Tina Modotti (born Assunta Adelaide Luigia Modotti Mondini, August 16/17, 1896 – January 5, 1942) was an Italian American photographer, model, actor, and revolutionary political activist for the Comintern. She left her native Italy in 1913 and emigrated to the United States, where she settled in San Francisco with her father and sister. In San Francisco, Modotti worked as a seamstress, model, and theater performer and, later, moved to Los Angeles where she worked in film. She later became a photographer and essayist. In 1922 she moved to Mexico, where she became an active member of the Mexican Communist Party.

==Early life==
Modotti was born Assunta Adelaide Luigia Modotti Mondini in Udine, Friuli, Italy. Her mother, Assunta, was a seamstress; her father, Giuseppe, was a mason. After spending time living in Austria, where her parents were migrant workers, the family returned to Udine, where the young Modotti worked in a textile factory. In 1913, at the age of 16, she emigrated to the United States to join her father in San Francisco, California. Departing from Genoa aboard the SS &quot;Moltke&quot; on June 24, she traveled alone, according to Letizia Argenteri, author of &quot;Tina Modotti: Between Art and Revolution&quot;, arriving on July 8 at Ellis Island, where she &quot;declared herself to be single, five feet one inch tall, in good mental and physical health, and a student.&quot; She carried with her &quot;100 dollars and a train ticket for San Francisco, where her father and her sister Mercedes resided.&quot;

==Acting career==

Attracted to the performing arts supported by the Italian émigré community in the San Francisco Bay Area, Modotti experimented with acting. She appeared in several plays, operas, and silent movies in the late 1910s and early 1920s, and also worked as an artist&#x27;s model.

In 1917, she met Roubaix &quot;Robo&quot; de l&#x27;Abrie Richey. Originally a farm boy from Oregon named Ruby Ritchie, the artist and poet assumed the more bohemian name Roubaix. In 1918, Modotti began a romantic relationship with him and moved with him to Los Angeles to pursue a career in the motion picture industry. Although the couple cohabited and lived as a &quot;married couple&quot;, they were not married. She was listed as a U.S. citizen in the 1920 Los Angeles township census. Often playing the femme fatale, Modotti&#x27;s movie career culminated in the 1920 film &quot;The Tiger&#x27;s Coat&quot;. She had minor parts in two other films.

The couple entered into a bohemian circle of friends. One of these fellow bohemians was Ricardo Gómez Robelo. Another was the photographer, Edward Weston.

==Photography career==
As a young girl in Italy her uncle, Pietro Modotti, maintained a photography studio. Later in the U.S., her father briefly ran a similar studio in San Francisco. While in Los Angeles, she met the photographer Edward Weston and his creative partner Margrethe Mather. It was through her relationship with Weston that Modotti developed as an important fine art photographer and documentarian. By 1921, Modotti was Weston&#x27;s lover. Ricardo Gómez Robelo became the head of Mexico&#x27;s Ministry of Education&#x27;s Fine Arts Department, and persuaded Robo to come to Mexico with a promise of a job and a studio.

Robo left for Mexico in December 1921. Perhaps unaware of his affair with Modotti, Robo took with him prints of Weston&#x27;s, hoping to mount an exhibition of his and Weston&#x27;s work in Mexico. While she was on her way to be with Robo, Modotti received word of his death from smallpox on February 9, 1922. Devastated, she arrived two days after his death. In March 1922, determined to see Robo&#x27;s vision realized, she mounted a two-week exhibition of Robo&#x27;s and Weston&#x27;s work at the National Academy of Fine Arts in Mexico City. She sustained a second loss with the death of her father, which forced her to return to San Francisco later in March 1922. In 1923, Modotti returned to Mexico City with Weston and his son Chandler, leaving behind Weston&#x27;s wife Flora and their youngest three children. She agreed to run Weston&#x27;s studio free of charge in return for his mentoring her in photography.

Together they opened a portrait studio in Mexico City. Modotti and Weston quickly gravitated toward the capital&#x27;s bohemian scene and used their connections to create an expanding portrait business. Together they found a community of cultural and political &quot;avant-gardists&quot;, which included Frida Kahlo, Lupe Marín, Diego Rivera, and Jean Charlot. In general, Weston was moved by the landscape and folk art of Mexico to create abstract works, while Modotti was more captivated by the people of Mexico and blended this human interest with a modernist aesthetic, all the while shunning the term &#x27;artist&#x27;, insisting she merely wanted to &quot;capture social realities&quot;. Modotti also became the photographer of choice for the blossoming Mexican mural movement, documenting the works of José Clemente Orozco and Diego Rivera. Between 1924 and 1928, Modotti took hundreds of photographs of Rivera&#x27;s murals at the Secretariat of Public Education in Mexico City. Modotti&#x27;s visual vocabulary matured during this period, such as her formal experiments with architectural interiors, blooming flowers, urban landscapes, and especially in her many beautiful images of peasants and workers during the depression. In 1926, Modotti and Weston were commissioned by Anita Brenner to travel around Mexico and take photographs for what would become her influential book &quot;Idols Behind Altars&quot;. The relative contributions of Modotti and Weston to the project has been debated. Weston&#x27;s son Brett, who accompanied the two on the project, indicated that the photographs were taken by Edward Weston.

In 1925, Modotti joined International Red Aid, a Communist organization. In November 1926, Weston left Mexico and returned to California. During this time Modotti met several political radicals and Communists, including three Mexican Communist Party leaders who would all eventually become romantically linked with her: Xavier Guerrero, Julio Antonio Mella, and Vittorio Vidali.

Starting in 1927, a much more politically active Modotti (she joined the Mexican Communist Party that year) found her focus shifting and more of her work becoming politically motivated. Around that time her photographs began appearing in publications such as &quot;Mexican Folkways&quot;, &quot;Forma&quot;, and the more radically motivated &quot;El Machete&quot;, the German Communist Party&#x27;s &quot;Arbeiter-Illustrierte-Zeitung&quot; (AIZ), and &quot;New Masses&quot;. From 1929 she contributed to &quot;Der Kuckuck&quot;, a publication of the Austrian Social Democratic Party.

Mexican photographer Manuel Álvarez Bravo divided Modotti&#x27;s career as a photographer into two distinct categories: &quot;Romantic&quot; and &quot;Revolutionary&quot;, with the former period including her time spent as Weston&#x27;s darkroom assistant, office manager and, finally, creative partner. Her later works were the focus of her one-woman retrospective exhibition at the National Library in December 1929, which was advertised as &quot;The First Revolutionary Photographic Exhibition In Mexico&quot;.

==Life as an activist==
Modotti began a relationship with Xavier Guerrero, who was a member of the Mexican Communist Party, in 1927. Guerrero was sent to Moscow for a year to take part in political party training, and by 1928 Modotti had met and begun a relationship with the exiled Cuban activist Julio Antonio Mella. During this same period, economic and political conflicts within Mexico and indeed much of Central and South America were intensifying and this included increased repression of political dissidents. In 1929, Mella was assassinated while walking in the street with Modotti from the offices of Red Aid, a Comintern-attached organization that offered relief to and defended victims of political repression. Modotti was immediately arrested, but later released and cleared of his murder. Shortly thereafter, an attempt was made on the life of the Mexican President Pascual Ortiz Rubio. Modotti – who was a target of both the Mexican and Italian political police — was questioned about both crimes amidst a concerted anti-communist, anti-immigrant press campaign, that depicted &quot;the fierce and bloody Tina Modotti&quot; as the perpetrator (a Catholic zealot, Daniel Luis Flores, was later charged with shooting Ortiz Rubio. José Magriñat was arrested for Mella&#x27;s murder).

As a result of the anti-communist campaign by the Mexican government, Modotti was exiled from Mexico in 1930. She first spent several months in Berlin, followed by several years in Moscow. Traveling on a restricted visa that mandated her final destination as Italy, Modotti initially stopped in Berlin and from there visited Switzerland. The Italian government made concerted efforts to extradite her as a subversive national, but with the assistance of International Red Aid activists, she evaded detention by the fascist police. She apparently intended to make her way into Italy to join the anti-fascist resistance there. In response to the deteriorating political situation in Germany and her own exhausted resources, however, she followed the advice of Vittorio Vidali and moved to Moscow in 1931. After 1931, Modotti no longer photographed. Reports of later photographs are unsubstantiated.

During the next few years she engaged in various missions on behalf of the Workers International Relief organizations as a Comintern agent in Europe. When the Spanish Civil War erupted in 1936, Vidali (then known as &quot;Comandante Carlos&quot;) and Modotti (using the pseudonym &quot;Maria&quot;) left Moscow for Spain, where they stayed and worked until 1939. She worked with Canadian Dr. Norman Bethune during the disastrous retreat from Málaga in 1937. In 1939, following the collapse of the Republican movement in Spain, Modotti left Spain with Vidali and returned to Mexico under a pseudonym.

==Death==
In 1942, at the age of 45, Modotti died from heart failure while on her way home in a taxi from a dinner at Hannes Meyer&#x27;s home in Mexico City, under what are viewed by some as suspicious circumstances. After hearing about her death, Diego Rivera suggested that Vidali had orchestrated it. Modotti may have &#x27;known too much&#x27; about Vidali&#x27;s activities in Spain, which included a rumoured 400 executions. An autopsy showed that she died of natural causes, namely congestive heart failure. Her grave is located within the vast Panteón de Dolores in Mexico City. Poet Pablo Neruda composed Modotti&#x27;s epitaph, part of which can also be found on her tombstone, which also includes a relief portrait of Modotti by engraver Leopoldo Méndez:

:&quot;Pure your gentle name, pure your fragile life,&quot;
:&quot;bees, shadows, fire, snow, silence and foam,&quot;
:&quot;combined with steel and wire and&quot;
:&quot;pollen to make up your firm&quot;
:&quot;and delicate being.&quot;

==Murals by Diego Rivera that include Modotti==

*&quot;The Abundant Earth&quot;, The National Agricultural School, Chapingo, 1926
:In 1926, Diego Rivera&#x27;s wife Lupe Marín asserted that her separation from her husband was caused by his affair with Modotti, which had arisen from Modotti&#x27;s nude modeling for him for the murals as &quot;the Abundant Earth&quot; at the National Agricultural School in Chapingo, near Texcoco [1926–27]. Their affair lasted for about a year and he painted her five times in the Chapingo murals, including as &quot;The Earth Enslaved&quot;, &quot;Germination&quot;, and &quot;Virgin Earth&quot;.

*&quot;In the Arsenal&quot;, Secretaría de Educación Pública Building, Mexico City, 1928
:This painting was part of the break between Modotti and Rivera caused by his expulsion from the Communist Party. The mural depicts Modotti passing out ammunition, perhaps for the revolution of Augusto Sandino in Nicaragua, perhaps for the &quot;invasion&quot; of Cuba that Mella was planning at that time hoping to overthrow the regime of General Gerardo Machado, or perhaps just in support of insurrection against injustice everywhere. She is shown gazing at her then lover Mella while Vidali peers over her shoulder. Modotti objected to Rivera&#x27;s use of her private life in such a public manner. She wrote to Weston, &quot;Recently Diego has taken to painting details with an exaggerated precision. He leaves nothing to the imagination.&quot; The central figure in this painting is Rivera&#x27;s then-lover, the artist Frida Kahlo. Kahlo, who had first met Rivera as a schoolgirl in 1922 when he was painting his first mural &quot;The Creation&quot; in the Bolívar Auditorium of the National Preparatory School in Mexico City, is reputed to have been reintroduced to Rivera in 1928 at a party in Modotti&#x27;s home, although there are other versions of the tale of their meeting. Modotti hosted Kahlo and Rivera&#x27;s wedding party on August 21, 1929. The final rift between Modotti on the one hand and Rivera and Kahlo on the other, less than a month later, appears to have been political rather than personal. Modotti supported Rivera&#x27;s expulsion from the Communist Party. Modotti&#x27;s internationalism, and her belief that this was best advanced by adherence to the line of the Mexican Communist Party and the Communist International, were deeply held. Later, she explained her decision to abandon photography for political work following her expulsion from Mexico thus (inverting an outlook stated to her years earlier by Edward Weston): &quot;I cannot solve the problem of life by losing myself in the problem of art&quot;. Rivera&#x27;s expulsion started him on a trajectory which was to lead to his later association with Leon Trotsky and the Fourth International.

==Select photography exhibitions==
In 1996 the Philadelphia Museum of Art organized a large-scale retrospective dedicated to the artist, entitled &quot;Tina Modotti: Photographs&quot;. Martha Chahroudi, the museum&#x27;s curator of photography, organized the exhibition. To raise funds for the show, the singer Madonna auctioned her 1963 Mercedes-Benz. Madonna has become a major collector of Modotti&#x27;s work. In 2006, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art organized an exhibition entitled &quot;Mexico as Muse: Tina Modotti and Edward Weston&quot;.

Prior to the presentation of her work in the U.S., Modotti&#x27;s photographs have been shown in Italy, Poland, Germany, Austria, and other countries. In 2010, the largest exhibition of her work, &quot;Tina Modotti Photographer and Revolutionary&quot; opened at the KunstHausWien in Vienna, Austria. It presented 250 photographs, many never shown before. The exhibition is based on the collections of Galerie Bilderwelt, Berlin and Spencer Throckmorton, NYC and curated by Reinhard Schultz. In 2015 the exhibition &quot;Tina Modotti: Photographs of Mexican Murals&quot; was organized at the Richard Norton Gallery. The State Museum and Exhibition Center ROSPHOTO in Saint Petersburg, Russia, organized an exhibition of Modotti&#x27;s work entitled &quot;Tina Modotti. Art. Love. Revolution&quot; from 20 September 2019 to 18 November 2019. In Italy, Palazzo Ducale in Genoa organized the exhibition &quot;Donne, Messico e Libertà&quot; from 8 April 2022 to 9 October 2022.

<text>Scarab of Ra is a Mac OS shareware computer game written in 1987 by Rick Holzgrafe and released in 1988 by Semicolon Software, with a modernized version released in 2022. It is an adventure set within an Egyptian pyramid.

==Story==
A sandstorm has uncovered the Great Pyramid of Ra. The player, a lowly archaeology student, decides to learn its secrets and tell of its wonders. After securing food and a lantern on short notice, the player enters the pyramid with hopes of finding and relying on additional equipment abandoned by earlier expeditions.

==Interface==
The game is rendered in monochrome from a first person perspective; the rendering engine only allows grid-based, frame-by-frame movement. The game is played via a point-and-click, icon-driven interface in combination with keyboard shortcuts.

==Gameplay==

Gameplay is that of a simplified roguelike game, utilising permadeath mechanics. Upon starting a new game, the layout of the game is randomised; the player can only save by quitting, a mechanic put in place to prevent save scumming. Death is frequent and quick, forcing players to make the most of their skills and careful use of all items they come across. Many items have several uses that the player must either discover through experimentation or use of an in-game hint system.

Levels are square mazes that grow larger as the player descends, simulating the design of a pyramid. The first level is 3x3, totalling 9 squares. Each succeeding level is one step larger in each dimension (so the next level is 4x4 steps, for a total of 16 squares, and so on). A key on each must be found to unlock the next level. Ascension is impossible, which can strand players if an important item is left behind.

The pyramid also contains traps, which can harm the player in various ways, and animals, including cobras, lionesses, thieving monkeys, and a mummy, which appears only to players who carry the eponymous Scarab of Ra. Animal threats can be dealt with in a number of ways, but only the mummy can be destroyed; the game&#x27;s author notes that violence is distasteful, but &quot;the mummy was dead anyway&quot;.

Movement is turn-based, with a speed setting that alters how many moves other characters can make after the player acts. Speeds range from 1 (slowest) to 10 (fastest), with a map automatically drawn at speeds 5 and below. The map can be accessed and marked at any point, and is an invaluable tool as the levels become larger and more involved. Traveling at high speeds consumes less food and oil, but the player may blunder into danger and movements will not be recorded on the map if over speed 5. Traps are less likely to be triggered and sleeping animals are less likely to be woken when walking at slower speeds, but it consumes more food and oil.

==Objective==
In order to complete the game, one must gather three major treasures: the Crown, Staff, and Scarab of Ra. Once this task is accomplished, an exit is revealed, yet players can choose to continue playing if they wish to risk death and increase their scores. Once a player picks up the Scarab, mummy-like Guardians immediately began their hunt, delivering an electric shock upon contact.

When the player wins or quits, their character attains a rank based on &quot;prestige points&quot; accrued during the game.

==Reception==
&quot;Macworld&quot; named the Macintosh version of &quot;Scarab of Ra&quot; the &quot;Best Egyptian Adventure and 3-D Maze&quot; as part of its Shareware and Public Domain Game Awards in 1987.

==Legacy==
The original version of &quot;Scarab of Ra&quot; ran only on Macintosh computers under the classic Mac OS. It could formerly be purchased through the author&#x27;s Kagi page. When OS X replaced the classic OS, &quot;Scarab of Ra&quot; could no longer be used without an emulator such as Mini vMac.

In 2022, the original author released a new version compatible with iPhone, iPad, and M1 Macintosh computers. This version is available in the App Store.

<doc id="884034" wikidata="Q2318235" url="?curid=884034" title="The Ashlee Simpson Show">
<text>The Ashlee Simpson Show is a reality television series about the life of Ashlee Simpson. The first season, taped from late 2003 to mid-2004, focused on the beginnings of her career as a singer and the recording of her debut album, &quot;Autobiography&quot;. A second season, taped from late 2004 to early 2005, focused on her career after the album&#x27;s release.

Consisting of eight half-hour episodes, the first season ran on MTV in the United States in the summer of 2004. The show proved quite successful and helped to establish widespread recognition for Simpson, whose album was released on July 20, 2004, a month after the show began airing, and debuted at number one in sales. Jordan Schur, the president of Simpson&#x27;s record label, Geffen, said that &quot;There&#x27;s no question that it really helped expose her and her music. She&#x27;s got a tremendous personality; people gravitate toward that. They want to watch her and listen to her music.&quot; The second and final season, consisting of ten episodes, aired in early 2005.

==Series overview==
The show begins with Simpson signing her record deal with Geffen; the first season ends with the U.S. release of her album, and the second season ends with the launch of her first tour.

Much of the show deals with the process of writing and recording songs. Simpson expresses her preference for rock music and that she wants her album to reflect that; she says she does not want her album to sound like the pop music of Hilary Duff or her sister Jessica. The show ties Simpson&#x27;s music together with her personal life in that many of the songs are inspired by events in her personal life, both good and bad.

The show also chronicles minor but often humorous tribulations of Simpson&#x27;s life. Simpson&#x27;s parents, Joe and Tina, appear frequently, as well as her sister Jessica.

<doc id="884035" wikidata="Q547903" url="?curid=884035" title="Josia Thugwane">
<text>Josia Thugwane (born 15 April 1971) is a South African retired long-distance runner, best known for winning the gold medal in the marathon at the 1996 Summer Olympics. Thugwane, who is of Ndebele heritage, is the first black athlete to earn an Olympic gold for South Africa.

Born in Bethal, Thugwane ran his first marathon in 1991, but his breakthrough to the international athletics scene came in 1995, when he won the Honolulu Marathon.

Just five months before the Games commenced, Thugwane was carjacked and shot; the bullet grazed his chin, leaving an inch-long scar, and he injured his back as a result of jumping from his moving car. The coalmine that employed him paid for his medical care and rehabilitation.

At Atlanta, in the 1996 Olympic marathon, a large leading pack stayed in contact with each other for most of the race, until at the 35 km mark when Thugwane initiated a break away and he along with Lee Bong-Ju from South Korea and Erick Wainaina from Kenya. They stayed together until entering the stadium, when Thugwane got a slight lead. Thugwane finished three seconds ahead of Lee for the closest Olympic marathon finish ever.

Thugwane had a very successful year in 1997 by winning the Fukuoka Marathon and he won the AIMS Best Marathon Runner Award that year. After that point his career performance dipped. He failed to finish in three successive marathons, and finished only twentieth in the 2000 Sydney Olympic marathon despite top ten finishes in the New York Marathon and London Marathon that year. In 2002 he won the Nagano Olympic Memorial Marathon in Japan.

He was awarded the Silver Order of Ikhamanga, South Africa&#x27;s second highest cultural honour, in 2011.

<text>The &quot;Four Horsemen&quot; (in allusion to the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse) was the nickname given by the press to four conservative members of the United States Supreme Court during the 1932–1937 terms, who opposed the New Deal agenda of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. They were Justices Pierce Butler, James Clark McReynolds, George Sutherland, and Willis Van Devanter. They were opposed by the liberal &quot;Three Musketeers&quot;—Justices Louis Brandeis, Benjamin Cardozo, and Harlan Stone. Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes and Justice Owen J. Roberts controlled the balance. Hughes was more inclined to join the liberals, but Roberts was often swayed to the side of the conservatives.

==Opposition to New Deal==
Though at first the court had accepted some of the New Deal legislation over the objections of the four conservative justices, in the 1935 term, the Four Horsemen, together with Roberts and Hughes, voided the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 (&quot;United States v. Butler&quot;, 297 U.S. 1 [1936]), along with the Federal Farm Bankruptcy Act, the Railroad Act, and the Coal Mining Act. In &quot;Carter v. Carter Coal Company&quot;, 298 U.S. 238 (1936), the Four together with Roberts voided legislation regulating the coal industry; the same line-up voided a New York minimum wage law for women and children in &quot;Morehead v. New York&quot;, 298 U.S. 587 (1936). The court had also struck down the National Industrial Recovery Act in &quot;Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States&quot; 295 U.S. 495 (1935) the previous May. Though the latter decision was unanimous, Cardozo did not join the opinion for the court (written by Hughes and joined by Brandeis, Roberts, and the Four Horsemen), and wrote a separate concurrence, joined by Stone, to state the view of why the delegated power of legislation in the code at issue was &quot;not canalized within banks that keep it from overflowing.&quot;

The Four Horsemen would ride in a car to and from the court together to coordinate positions and arguments. They were vehemently opposed to the New Deal policies for unemployment and economic recovery, and they invalidated state laws regulating labor and business relations. The Four&#x27;s votes kept Congress and the states from regulating the economy. These actions led many observers to the conclusion that the court was likely to be obstructive to all legislative efforts to cope with the depression, and to remain wedded to the precedents of the &quot;Lochner&quot; era. Some academics argued that the court&#x27;s aversion to &quot;regulated capitalism&quot; confronted the country with &quot;the question not how governmental functions shall be shared, but whether in substance we shall govern at all.&quot;

The result of these dynamics was a steady drift of the court towards a crisis; the 1935 term was labeled by Stone &quot;one of the most disastrous in [the court&#x27;s] history.&quot; New Dealers decried the court&#x27;s actions as &quot;economic dictatorship&quot; and some communities even hanged the justices in effigy.

==Reform Bill of 1937==
When Roosevelt rolled out his reform plan in early 1937, all Four Horsemen of Reaction were over the age of 70. Roosevelt indicated that the elderly justices lacked energy. He said, &quot;A lower mental or physical vigor leads men to avoid an examination of complicated and changed conditions.&quot;

It was the success of the Horsemen in striking down New Deal legislation that led to Roosevelt&#x27;s court-packing scheme, a controversial proposal in February 1937 to appoint more justices in order to change the composition of the court. This was rendered unnecessary when Roberts, who had supported the Four Horsemen on several decisions during the 1935–1936 term, sided with the Three Musketeers in a landmark minimum wage case in March 1937 (known as &quot;the switch in time that saved nine&quot;). This, together with the retirement of Van Devanter in June 1937 and his replacement by Hugo Black ended the Four Horsemen&#x27;s domination of the court. Black and Roosevelt considered the Four the &quot;direct descendants of Darwin and Spencer.&quot;

Sutherland retired from the Court in 1938 and Butler died in 1939. McReynolds was the last of the Four Horsemen to step down, retiring in 1941.

<doc id="884040" wikidata="Q663908" url="?curid=884040" title="Bivector">
<text>In mathematics, a bivector or 2-vector is a quantity in exterior algebra or geometric algebra that extends the idea of scalars and vectors. Considering a scalar as a degree-zero quantity and a vector as a degree-one quantity, a bivector is of degree two. Bivectors have applications in many areas of mathematics and physics. They are related to complex numbers in two dimensions and to both pseudovectors and vector quaternions in three dimensions. They can be used to generate rotations in a space of any number of dimensions, and are a useful tool for classifying such rotations.

Geometrically, a simple bivector can be interpreted as characterizing a directed plane segment (or oriented plane segment), much as vectors can be thought of as characterizing &quot;directed line segments&quot;. The bivector has an &quot;attitude&quot; (or direction) of the plane spanned by and , has an area that is a scalar multiple of any reference plane segment with the same attitude (and in geometric algebra, it has a &quot;magnitude&quot; equal to the area of the parallelogram with edges and ), and has an &quot;orientation&quot; being the side of on which lies within the plane spanned by and . 

In layman terms, any surface defines the same bivector if it is parallel to the same plane (same attitude), has the same area, and same orientation (see figure).

Bivectors are generated by the exterior product on vectors: given two vectors and , their exterior product is a bivector, as is any sum of bivectors. Not all bivectors can be expressed as an exterior product without such summation. More precisely, a bivector that can be expressed as an exterior product is called &quot;simple&quot;; in up to three dimensions all bivectors are simple, but in higher dimensions this is not the case. The exterior product of two vectors is alternating, so is the zero bivector, and is the negative of the bivector , producing the opposite orientation. Concepts directly related to bivector are rank-2 antisymmetric tensor and skew-symmetric matrix.

== History ==
The bivector was first defined in 1844 by German mathematician Hermann Grassmann in exterior algebra as the result of the exterior product of two vectors. Just the previous year, in Ireland, William Rowan Hamilton had discovered quaternions. Hamilton coined both &quot;vector&quot; and &quot;bivector&quot;, the latter in his &quot;Lectures on Quaternions&quot; (1853) as he introduced biquaternions, which have bivectors for their vector parts. It was not until English mathematician William Kingdon Clifford in 1888 added the geometric product to Grassmann&#x27;s algebra, incorporating the ideas of both Hamilton and Grassmann, and founded Clifford algebra, that the bivector of this article arose. Henry Forder used the term &quot;bivector&quot; to develop exterior algebra in 1941.

In the 1890s Josiah Willard Gibbs and Oliver Heaviside developed vector calculus, which included separate cross product and dot products that were derived from quaternion multiplication. The success of vector calculus, and of the book &quot;Vector Analysis&quot; by Gibbs and Wilson, had the effect that the insights of Hamilton and Clifford were overlooked for a long time, since much of 20th century mathematics and physics was formulated in vector terms. Gibbs used vectors to fill the role of bivectors in three dimensions, and used bivector in Hamilton&#x27;s sense, a use that has sometimes been copied.
Today the bivector is largely studied as a topic in geometric algebra, a Clifford algebra over real or complex vector spaces with a quadratic form. Its resurgence was led by David Hestenes who, along with others, applied geometric algebra to a range of new applications in physics.

== Derivation ==
For this article, the bivector will be considered only in real geometric algebras, which may be applied in most areas of physics. Also unless otherwise stated, all examples have a Euclidean metric and so a positive-definite quadratic form.

=== Geometric algebra and the geometric product ===
The bivector arises from the definition of the geometric product over a vector space with an associated quadratic form sometimes called the &quot;metric&quot;. For vectors , and , the geometric product satisfies the following properties:
; Associativity : formula_1
; Left and right distributivity : formula_2
; Scalar square : , where is the quadratic form, which need not be positive-definite.

=== Scalar product ===
From associativity, , is a scalar times . When is not parallel to and hence not a scalar multiple of , cannot be a scalar. But
: formula_3
is a sum of scalars and so a scalar. From the law of cosines on the triangle formed by the vectors its value is , where is the angle between the vectors. It is therefore identical to the scalar product between two vectors, and is written the same way,
: formula_4

It is symmetric, scalar-valued, and can be used to determine the angle between two vectors: in particular if and are orthogonal the product is zero.

=== Exterior product ===
Just as the scalar product can be formulated as the symmetric part of the geometric product of another quantity, the exterior product (sometimes known as the &quot;wedge&quot; or &quot;progressive&quot; product) can be formulated as its antisymmetric part:
: formula_5

It is antisymmetric in and 
: formula_6
and by addition:
: formula_7

That is, the geometric product is the sum of the symmetric scalar product and alternating exterior product.

To examine the nature of , consider the formula
: formula_8
which using the Pythagorean trigonometric identity gives the value of 
: formula_9

With a negative square, it cannot be a scalar or vector quantity, so it is a new sort of object, a bivector. It has magnitude , where is the angle between the vectors, and so is zero for parallel vectors.

To distinguish them from vectors, bivectors are written here with bold capitals, for example:
: formula_10
although other conventions are used, in particular as vectors and bivectors are both elements of the geometric algebra.

== Properties ==
The algebra generated by the geometric product (that is, all objects formed by taking repeated sums and geometric products of scalars and vectors) is the geometric algebra over the vector space. For an Euclidean vector space, this algebra is written formula_11 or , where is the dimension of the vector space . is both a vector space and an algebra, generated by all the products between vectors in , so it contains all vectors and bivectors. More precisely, as a vector space it contains the vectors and bivectors as linear subspaces, though not as subalgebras (since the geometric product of two vectors is not generally another vector).

=== The space ⋀2R&quot;n&quot; ===
The space of all bivectors has dimension and is written , and is the second exterior power of the original vector space.

=== Even subalgebra ===
The subalgebra generated by the bivectors is the &quot;even subalgebra&quot; of the geometric algebra, written . This algebra results from considering all repeated sums and geometric products of scalars and bivectors. It has dimension , and contains as a linear subspace. In two and three dimensions the even subalgebra contains only scalars and bivectors, and each is of particular interest. In two dimensions, the even subalgebra is isomorphic to the complex numbers, , while in three it is isomorphic to the quaternions, . The even subalgebra contains the rotations in any dimension.

=== Magnitude ===
As noted in the previous section the magnitude of a simple bivector, that is one that is the exterior product of two vectors and , is , where is the angle between the vectors. It is written , where is the bivector.

For general bivectors, the magnitude can be calculated by taking the norm of the bivector considered as a vector in the space . If the magnitude is zero then all the bivector&#x27;s components are zero, and the bivector is the zero bivector which as an element of the geometric algebra equals the scalar zero.

=== Unit bivectors ===
A unit bivector is one with unit magnitude. Such a bivector can be derived from any non-zero bivector by dividing the bivector by its magnitude, that is
: formula_12
Of particular utility are the unit bivectors formed from the products of the standard basis of the vector space. If and are distinct basis vectors then the product is a bivector. As and are orthogonal, , written , and has unit magnitude as the vectors are unit vectors. The set of all bivectors produced from the basis in this way form a basis for . For instance, in four dimensions the basis for is (, , , , , ) or (, , , , , ).

=== Simple bivectors ===
The exterior product of two vectors is a bivector, but not all bivectors are exterior products of two vectors. For example, in four dimensions the bivector
: formula_13
cannot be written as the exterior product of two vectors. A bivector that can be written as the exterior product of two vectors is simple. In two and three dimensions all bivectors are simple, but not in four or more dimensions; in four dimensions every bivector is the sum of at most two exterior products. A bivector has a real square if and only if it is simple, and only simple bivectors can be represented geometrically by a directed plane area.

=== Product of two bivectors ===
The geometric product of two bivectors, and , is
: formula_14

The quantity is the scalar-valued scalar product, while is the grade 4 exterior product that arises in four or more dimensions. The quantity is the bivector-valued commutator product, given by
: formula_15

The space of bivectors is a Lie algebra over , with the commutator product as the Lie bracket. The full geometric product of bivectors generates the even subalgebra.

Of particular interest is the product of a bivector with itself. As the commutator product is antisymmetric the product simplifies to
: formula_16

If the bivector is &quot;simple&quot; the last term is zero and the product is the scalar-valued , which can be used as a check for simplicity. In particular the exterior product of bivectors only exists in four or more dimensions, so all bivectors in two and three dimensions are simple.

=== General bivectors and matrices ===
Bivectors are isomorphic to skew-symmetric matrices in any number of dimensions. For example, the general bivector in three dimensions maps to the matrix
: formula_17

This multiplied by vectors on both sides gives the same vector as the product of a vector and bivector minus the exterior product; an example is the angular velocity tensor.

Skew symmetric matrices generate orthogonal matrices with determinant through the exponential map. In particular, applying the exponential map to a bivector that is associated with a rotation yields a rotation matrix. The rotation matrix given by the skew-symmetric matrix above is
: formula_18

The rotation described by is the same as that described by the rotor given by
: formula_19
and the matrix can be also calculated directly from rotor . In three dimensions, this is given by
: formula_20

Bivectors are related to the eigenvalues of a rotation matrix. Given a rotation matrix the eigenvalues can be calculated by solving the characteristic equation for that matrix . By the fundamental theorem of algebra this has three roots (only one of which is real as there is only one eigenvector, i.e., the axis of rotation). The other roots must be a complex conjugate pair. They have unit magnitude so purely imaginary logarithms, equal to the magnitude of the bivector associated with the rotation, which is also the angle of rotation. The eigenvectors associated with the complex eigenvalues are in the plane of the bivector, so the exterior product of two non-parallel eigenvectors results in the bivector (or a multiple thereof).

== Two dimensions ==
When working with coordinates in geometric algebra it is usual to write the basis vectors as (, a convention that will be used here.

A vector in real two-dimensional space can be written , where and are real numbers, and are orthonormal basis vectors. The geometric product of two such vectors is
: formula_21

This can be split into the symmetric, scalar-valued, scalar product and an antisymmetric, bivector-valued exterior product:
: formula_22

All bivectors in two dimensions are of this form, that is multiples of the bivector , written to emphasise it is a bivector rather than a vector. The magnitude of is , with
: formula_23
so it is called the unit bivector. The term unit bivector can be used in other dimensions but it is only uniquely defined (up to a sign) in two dimensions and all bivectors are multiples of . As the highest grade element of the algebra is also the pseudoscalar which is given the symbol .

=== Complex numbers ===
With the properties of negative square and unit magnitude, the unit bivector can be identified with the imaginary unit from complex numbers. The bivectors and scalars together form the even subalgebra of the geometric algebra, which is isomorphic to the complex numbers . The even subalgebra has basis , the whole algebra has basis .

The complex numbers are usually identified with the coordinate axes and two-dimensional vectors, which would mean associating them with the vector elements of the geometric algebra. There is no contradiction in this, as to get from a general vector to a complex number an axis needs to be identified as the real axis, say. This multiplies by all vectors to generate the elements of even subalgebra.

All the properties of complex numbers can be derived from bivectors, but two are of particular interest. First as with complex numbers products of bivectors and so the even subalgebra are commutative. This is only true in two dimensions, so properties of the bivector in two dimensions that depend on commutativity do not usually generalise to higher dimensions.

Second a general bivector can be written
: formula_24
where is a real number. Putting this into the Taylor series for the exponential map and using the property results in a bivector version of Euler&#x27;s formula,
: formula_25
which when multiplied by any vector rotates it through an angle about the origin:
: formula_26

The product of a vector with a bivector in two dimensions is anticommutative, so the following products all generate the same rotation
: formula_27

Of these the last product is the one that generalises into higher dimensions. The quantity needed is called a rotor and is given the symbol , so in two dimensions a rotor that rotates through angle can be written
: formula_28
and the rotation it generates is
: formula_29

== Three dimensions ==
In three dimensions the geometric product of two vectors is
: formula_30

This can be split into the symmetric, scalar-valued, scalar product and the antisymmetric, bivector-valued, exterior product:
: formula_31

In three dimensions all bivectors are simple and so the result of an exterior product. The unit bivectors , and form a basis for the space of bivectors , which is itself a three-dimensional linear space. So if a general bivector is:
: formula_32
they can be added like vectors
: formula_33
while when multiplied they produce the following
: formula_34
which can be split into symmetric scalar and antisymmetric bivector parts as follows
: formula_35

The exterior product of two bivectors in three dimensions is zero.

A bivector can be written as the product of its magnitude and a unit bivector, so writing for and using the Taylor series for the exponential map it can be shown that
: formula_36

This is another version of Euler&#x27;s formula, but with a general bivector in three dimensions. Unlike in two dimensions bivectors are not commutative so properties that depend on commutativity do not apply in three dimensions. For example, in general in three (or more) dimensions.
The full geometric algebra in three dimensions, , has basis (, , , , , , , ). The element is a trivector and the pseudoscalar for the geometry. Bivectors in three dimensions are sometimes identified with pseudovectors to which they are related, as discussed below.

=== Quaternions ===
Bivectors are not closed under the geometric product, but the even subalgebra is. In three dimensions it consists of all scalar and bivector elements of the geometric algebra, so a general element can be written for example , where is the scalar part and is the bivector part. It is written and has basis . The product of two general elements of the even subalgebra is
: formula_37

The even subalgebra, that is the algebra consisting of scalars and bivectors, is isomorphic to the quaternions, . This can be seen by comparing the basis to the quaternion basis, or from the above product which is identical to the quaternion product, except for a change of sign which relates to the negative products in the bivector scalar product . Other quaternion properties can be similarly related to or derived from geometric algebra.

This suggests that the usual split of a quaternion into scalar and vector parts would be better represented as a split into scalar and bivector parts; if this is done the quaternion product is merely the geometric product. It also relates quaternions in three dimensions to complex numbers in two, as each is isomorphic to the even subalgebra for the dimension, a relationship that generalises to higher dimensions.

=== Rotation vector ===
The rotation vector, from the axis–angle representation of rotations, is a compact way of representing rotations in three dimensions. In its most compact form, it consists of a vector, the product of a unit vector that is the axis of rotation with the (signed) angle of rotation , so that the magnitude of the overall rotation vector equals the (unsigned) rotation angle.

The quaternion associated with the rotation is
: formula_38

In geometric algebra the rotation is represented by a bivector. This can be seen in its relation to quaternions. Let be a unit bivector in the plane of rotation, and let be the angle of rotation. Then the rotation bivector is . The quaternion closely corresponds to the exponential of half of the bivector . That is, the components of the quaternion correspond to the scalar and bivector parts of the following expression:
formula_39

The exponential can be defined in terms of its power series, and easily evaluated using the fact that squared is .

So rotations can be represented by bivectors. Just as quaternions are elements of the geometric algebra, they are related by the exponential map in that algebra.

=== Rotors ===
The bivector generates a rotation through the exponential map. The even elements generated rotate a general vector in three dimensions in the same way as quaternions:
formula_40

As in two dimensions, the quantity is called a rotor and written . The quantity is then , and they generate rotations as
formula_41

This is identical to two dimensions, except here rotors are four-dimensional objects isomorphic to the quaternions. This can be generalised to all dimensions, with rotors, elements of the even subalgebra with unit magnitude, being generated by the exponential map from bivectors. They form a double cover over the rotation group, so the rotors and represent the same rotation.

=== Axial vectors ===
The rotation vector is an example of an axial vector. Axial vectors, or pseudovectors, are vectors with the special feature that their coordinates undergo a sign change relative to the usual vectors (also called &quot;polar vectors&quot;) under inversion through the origin, reflection in a plane, or other orientation-reversing linear transformation. Examples include quantities like torque, angular momentum and vector magnetic fields. Quantities that would use axial vectors in vector algebra are properly represented by bivectors in geometric algebra. More precisely, if an underlying orientation is chosen, the axial vectors are naturally identified with the usual vectors; the Hodge dual then gives the isomorphism between axial vectors and bivectors, so each axial vector is associated with a bivector and vice versa; that is
: formula_42
where is the Hodge star. Note that if the underlying orientation is reversed by inversion through the origin, both the identification of the axial vectors with the usual vectors and the Hodge dual change sign, but the bivectors don&#x27;t budge. Alternately, using the unit pseudoscalar in , gives
: formula_43

This is easier to use as the product is just the geometric product. But it is antisymmetric because (as in two dimensions) the unit pseudoscalar squares to , so a negative is needed in one of the products.

This relationship extends to operations like the vector-valued cross product and bivector-valued exterior product, as when written as determinants they are calculated in the same way:
: formula_44
so are related by the Hodge dual:
: formula_45

Bivectors have a number of advantages over axial vectors. They better disambiguate axial and polar vectors, that is the quantities represented by them, so it is clearer which operations are allowed and what their results are. For example, the inner product of a polar vector and an axial vector resulting from the cross product in the triple product should result in a pseudoscalar, a result which is more obvious if the calculation is framed as the exterior product of a vector and bivector. They generalise to other dimensions; in particular bivectors can be used to describe quantities like torque and angular momentum in two as well as three dimensions. Also, they closely match geometric intuition in a number of ways, as seen in the next section.

=== Geometric interpretation ===
As suggested by their name and that of the algebra, one of the attractions of bivectors is that they have a natural geometric interpretation. This can be described in any dimension but is best done in three where parallels can be drawn with more familiar objects, before being applied to higher dimensions. In two dimensions the geometric interpretation is trivial, as the space is two-dimensional so has only one plane, and all bivectors are associated with it differing only by a scale factor.

All bivectors can be interpreted as planes, or more precisely as directed plane segments. In three dimensions there are three properties of a bivector that can be interpreted geometrically:
* The arrangement of the plane in space, precisely the attitude of the plane (or alternately the rotation, geometric orientation or gradient of the plane), is associated with the ratio of the bivector components. In particular the three basis bivectors, , and , or scalar multiples of them, are associated with the -plane, -plane and -plane respectively.
* The magnitude of the bivector is associated with the area of the plane segment. The area does not have a particular shape so any shape can be used. It can even be represented in other ways, such as by an angular measure. But if the vectors are interpreted as lengths the bivector is usually interpreted as an area with the same units, as follows. 
* Like the direction of a vector a plane associated with a bivector has a direction, a circulation or a sense of rotation in the plane, which takes two values seen as clockwise and counterclockwise when viewed from viewpoint not in the plane. This is associated with a change of sign in the bivector, that is if the direction is reversed the bivector is negated. Alternately if two bivectors have the same attitude and magnitude but opposite directions then one is the negative of the other.
* If imagined as a parallelogram, with the origin for the vectors at 0, then signed area is the determinant of the vectors&#x27; Cartesian coordinates ().

In three dimensions all bivectors can be generated by the exterior product of two vectors. If the bivector then the magnitude of is
: formula_46
where is the angle between the vectors. This is the area of the parallelogram with edges and , as shown in the diagram. One interpretation is that the area is swept out by as it moves along . The exterior product is antisymmetric, so reversing the order of and to make move along results in a bivector with the opposite direction that is the negative of the first. The plane of bivector contains both and so they are both parallel to the plane.

Bivectors and axial vectors are related by Hodge dual. In a real vector space the Hodge dual relates a subspace to its orthogonal complement, so if a bivector is represented by a plane then the axial vector associated with it is simply the plane&#x27;s surface normal. The plane has two normals, one on each side, giving the two possible orientations for the plane and bivector.

This relates the cross product to the exterior product. It can also be used to represent physical quantities, like torque and angular momentum. In vector algebra they are usually represented by vectors, perpendicular to the plane of the force, linear momentum or displacement that they are calculated from. But if a bivector is used instead the plane is the plane of the bivector, so is a more natural way to represent the quantities and the way they act. It also unlike the vector representation generalises into other dimensions.

The product of two bivectors has a geometric interpretation. For non-zero bivectors and the product can be split into symmetric and antisymmetric parts as follows:
: formula_47

Like vectors these have magnitudes and , where is the angle between the planes. In three dimensions it is the same as the angle between the normal vectors dual to the planes, and it generalises to some extent in higher dimensions.

Bivectors can be added together as areas. Given two non-zero bivectors and in three dimensions it is always possible to find a vector that is contained in both, say, so the bivectors can be written as exterior products involving :
: formula_48

This can be interpreted geometrically as seen in the diagram: the two areas sum to give a third, with the three areas forming faces of a prism with , , and as edges. This corresponds to the two ways of calculating the area using the distributivity of the exterior product:
: formula_49

This only works in three dimensions as it is the only dimension where a vector parallel to both bivectors must exist. In higher dimensions bivectors generally are not associated with a single plane, or if they are (simple bivectors) two bivectors may have no vector in common, and so sum to a non-simple bivector.

== Four dimensions ==
In four dimensions, the basis elements for the space of bivectors are (, , , , , ), so a general bivector is of the form
: formula_50

=== Orthogonality ===
In four dimensions, the Hodge dual of a bivector is a bivector, and the space is dual to itself. Normal vectors are not unique, instead every plane is orthogonal to all the vectors in its Hodge dual space. This can be used to partition the bivectors into two &#x27;halves&#x27;, in the following way. We have three pairs of orthogonal bivectors: , and . There are four distinct ways of picking one bivector from each of the first two pairs, and once these first two are picked their sum yields the third bivector from the other pair. For example, and .

=== Simple bivectors in 4D ===
In four dimensions bivectors are generated by the exterior product of vectors in , but with one important difference from and . In four dimensions not all bivectors are simple. There are bivectors such as that cannot be generated by the exterior product of two vectors. This also means they do not have a real, that is scalar, square. In this case
: formula_51

The element is the pseudoscalar in , distinct from the scalar, so the square is non-scalar.

All bivectors in four dimensions can be generated using at most two exterior products and four vectors. The above bivector can be written as
: formula_52

Similarly, every bivector can be written as the sum of two simple bivectors. It is useful to choose two orthogonal bivectors for this, and this is always possible to do. Moreover, for a generic bivector the choice of simple bivectors is unique, that is, there is only one way to decompose into orthogonal bivectors; the only exception is when the two orthogonal bivectors have equal magnitudes (as in the above example): in this case the decomposition is not unique. The decomposition is always unique in the case of simple bivectors, with the added bonus that one of the orthogonal parts is zero.

=== Rotations in R4 ===
As in three dimensions bivectors in four dimension generate rotations through the exponential map, and all rotations can be generated this way. As in three dimensions if is a bivector then the rotor is and rotations are generated in the same way:
: formula_53

The rotations generated are more complex though. They can be categorised as follows:
: &quot;simple&quot; rotations are those that fix a plane in 4D, and rotate by an angle &quot;about&quot; this plane.
: &quot;double&quot; rotations have only one fixed point, the origin, and rotate through two angles about two orthogonal planes. In general the angles are different and the planes are uniquely specified
: &quot;isoclinic&quot; rotations are double rotations where the angles of rotation are equal. In this case the planes about which the rotation is taking place are not unique.

These are generated by bivectors in a straightforward way. Simple rotations are generated by simple bivectors, with the fixed plane the dual or orthogonal to the plane of the bivector. The rotation can be said to take place about that plane, in the plane of the bivector. All other bivectors generate double rotations, with the two angles of the rotation equalling the magnitudes of the two simple bivectors that the non-simple bivector is composed of. Isoclinic rotations arise when these magnitudes are equal, in which case the decomposition into two simple bivectors is not unique.

Bivectors in general do not commute, but one exception is orthogonal bivectors and exponents of them. So if the bivector , where and are orthogonal simple bivectors, is used to generate a rotation it decomposes into two simple rotations that commute as follows:
: formula_54

It is always possible to do this as all bivectors can be expressed as sums of orthogonal bivectors.

=== Spacetime rotations ===
Spacetime is a mathematical model for our universe used in special relativity. It consists of three space dimensions and one time dimension combined into a single four-dimensional space. It is naturally described using geometric algebra and bivectors, with the Euclidean metric replaced by a Minkowski metric. That algebra is identical to that of Euclidean space, except the signature is changed, so
: formula_55

(Note the order and indices above are not universal – here is the time-like dimension). The geometric algebra is , and the subspace of bivectors is .

The simple bivectors are of two types. The simple bivectors , and have negative squares and span the bivectors of the three-dimensional subspace corresponding to Euclidean space, . These bivectors generate ordinary rotations in .

The simple bivectors , and have positive squares and as planes span a space dimension and the time dimension. These also generate rotations through the exponential map, but instead of trigonometric functions, hyperbolic functions are needed, which generates a rotor as follows:
: formula_56
where is the bivector (, etc.), identified via the metric with an antisymmetric linear transformation of . These are Lorentz boosts, expressed in a particularly compact way, using the same kind of algebra as in and .

In general all spacetime rotations are generated from bivectors through the exponential map, that is, a general rotor generated by bivector is of the form
: formula_57

The set of all rotations in spacetime form the Lorentz group, and from them most of the consequences of special relativity can be deduced. More generally this show how transformations in Euclidean space and spacetime can all be described using the same kind of algebra.

=== Maxwell&#x27;s equations ===
(Note: in this section traditional 3-vectors are indicated by lines over the symbols and spacetime vector and bivectors by bold symbols, with the vectors and exceptionally in uppercase)

Maxwell&#x27;s equations are used in physics to describe the relationship between electric and magnetic fields. Normally given as four differential equations they have a particularly compact form when the fields are expressed as a spacetime bivector from . If the electric and magnetic fields in are and then the &quot;electromagnetic bivector&quot; is
: formula_58
where is again the basis vector for the time-like dimension and is the speed of light. The product yields the bivector that is Hodge dual to in three dimensions, as discussed above, while as a product of orthogonal vectors is also bivector-valued. As a whole it is the electromagnetic tensor expressed more compactly as a bivector, and is used as follows. First it is related to the 4-current , a vector quantity given by
: formula_59
where is current density and is charge density. They are related by a differential operator ∂, which is
: formula_60

The operator ∇ is a differential operator in geometric algebra, acting on the space dimensions and given by . When applied to vectors is the divergence and is the curl but with a bivector rather than vector result, that is dual in three dimensions to the curl. For general quantity they act as grade lowering and raising differential operators. In particular if is a scalar then this operator is just the gradient, and it can be thought of as a geometric algebraic del operator.

Together these can be used to give a particularly compact form for Maxwell&#x27;s equations with sources:
: formula_61

This equation, when decomposed according to geometric algebra, using geometric products which have both grade raising and grade lowering effects, is equivalent to Maxwell&#x27;s four equations. It is also related to the electromagnetic four-potential, a vector given by
: formula_62
where is the vector magnetic potential and is the electric potential. It is related to the electromagnetic bivector as follows
: formula_63
using the same differential operator .

== Higher dimensions ==
As has been suggested in earlier sections much of geometric algebra generalises well into higher dimensions. The geometric algebra for the real space is , and the subspace of bivectors is .

The number of simple bivectors needed to form a general bivector rises with the dimension, so for odd it is , for even it is . So for four and five dimensions only two simple bivectors are needed but three are required for six and seven dimensions. For example, in six dimensions with standard basis (, , , , , ) the bivector
: formula_64

is the sum of three simple bivectors but no less. As in four dimensions it is always possible to find orthogonal simple bivectors for this sum.

=== Rotations in higher dimensions ===
As in three and four dimensions rotors are generated by the exponential map, so
: formula_65
is the rotor generated by bivector . Simple rotations, that take place in a plane of rotation around a fixed blade of dimension are generated by simple bivectors, while other bivectors generate more complex rotations which can be described in terms of the simple bivectors they are sums of, each related to a plane of rotation. All bivectors can be expressed as the sum of orthogonal and commutative simple bivectors, so rotations can always be decomposed into a set of commutative rotations about the planes associated with these bivectors. The group of the rotors in dimensions is the spin group, .

One notable feature, related to the number of simple bivectors and so rotation planes, is that in odd dimensions every rotation has a fixed axis – it is misleading to call it an axis of rotation as in higher dimensions rotations are taking place in multiple planes orthogonal to it. This is related to bivectors, as bivectors in odd dimensions decompose into the same number of bivectors as the even dimension below, so have the same number of planes, but one extra dimension. As each plane generates rotations in two dimensions in odd dimensions there must be one dimension, that is an axis, that is not being rotated.

Bivectors are also related to the rotation matrix in dimensions. As in three dimensions the characteristic equation of the matrix can be solved to find the eigenvalues. In odd dimensions this has one real root, with eigenvector the fixed axis, and in even dimensions it has no real roots, so either all or all but one of the roots are complex conjugate pairs. Each pair is associated with a simple component of the bivector associated with the rotation. In particular, the log of each pair is the magnitude up to a sign, while eigenvectors generated from the roots are parallel to and so can be used to generate the bivector. In general the eigenvalues and bivectors are unique, and the set of eigenvalues gives the full decomposition into simple bivectors; if roots are repeated then the decomposition of the bivector into simple bivectors is not unique.

== Projective geometry ==
Geometric algebra can be applied to projective geometry in a straightforward way. The geometric algebra used is , the algebra of the real vector space . This is used to describe objects in the real projective space . The non-zero vectors in or are associated with points in the projective space so vectors that differ only by a scale factor, so their exterior product is zero, map to the same point. Non-zero simple bivectors in represent lines in , with bivectors differing only by a (positive or negative) scale factor representing the same line.

A description of the projective geometry can be constructed in the geometric algebra using basic operations. For example, given two distinct points in represented by vectors and the line containing them is given by (or ). Two lines intersect in a point if for their bivectors and . This point is given by the vector
: formula_66

The operation &quot;&quot; is the meet, which can be defined as above in terms of the join, for non-zero . Using these operations projective geometry can be formulated in terms of geometric algebra. For example, given a third (non-zero) bivector the point lies on the line given by if and only if
: formula_67

So the condition for the lines given by , and to be collinear is
: formula_68
which in and simplifies to
: formula_69
where the angle brackets denote the scalar part of the geometric product. In the same way all projective space operations can be written in terms of geometric algebra, with bivectors representing general lines in projective space, so the whole geometry can be developed using geometric algebra.

=== Tensors and matrices ===
As noted above a bivector can be written as a skew-symmetric matrix, which through the exponential map generates a rotation matrix that describes the same rotation as the rotor, also generated by the exponential map but applied to the vector. But it is also used with other bivectors such as the angular velocity tensor and the electromagnetic tensor, respectively a 3×3 and 4×4 skew-symmetric matrix or tensor.

Real bivectors in are isomorphic to skew-symmetric matrices, or alternately to antisymmetric tensors of degree 2 on . While bivectors are isomorphic to vectors (via the dual) in three dimensions they can be represented by skew-symmetric matrices in any dimension. This is useful for relating bivectors to problems described by matrices, so they can be re-cast in terms of bivectors, given a geometric interpretation, then often solved more easily or related geometrically to other bivector problems.

More generally, every real geometric algebra is isomorphic to a matrix algebra. These contain bivectors as a subspace, though often in a way which is not especially useful. These matrices are mainly of interest as a way of classifying Clifford algebras.

In 2011, David Black was one of several newspaper industry veterans who joined as investors in the San Francisco Newspaper Company to buy the former Hearst flagship &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot; from Clarity Media Group.

Media outlets initially reported the paper was purchased by Black&#x27;s company Black Press, but Black only participated as a private investor and held shares in the &quot;Examiner&quot; separately from Black Press. The other owners included Todd Vogt and Pat Brown. Vogt was named president and CEO while Brown was named chief financial officer of the newly created San Francisco Media Co.

The company acquired the &quot;San Francisco Bay Guardian&quot; from Bruce Brugmann in April 2012 and &quot;SF Weekly&quot; from Voice Media Group in January 2013.

In May 2014, Vogt announced plans to sell his shares of the company to Black Press&#x27; Hawaiian-subsidy Oahu Publications Inc., or to buy Black out of the company by the end of the month.

&quot;Unless I can find local partners, I&#x27;m not gonna do the deal,&quot; Vogt told staff. &quot;I&#x27;ve got 25 days to do a deal or sell out.&quot;

Vogt did sell to Oahu, which subsequently became San Francisco Media Co.&#x27;s parent company. Dennis Francis, president of Oahu Publications, became the company&#x27;s new president, and in August 2014, Glenn Zuehls was named publisher.

In October 2014, Zuehls announced &quot;Bay Guardian,&quot; saying &quot;the obstacles for a profitable &quot;Bay Guardian&quot; are too great to overcome.&quot;

In 2020, San Francisco Media Co., including the &quot;Examiner&quot; and &quot;SF Weekly,&quot; was sold to Clint Reilly Communications.

== Controversies ==
=== Nisga&#x27;a Treaty editorials ===
In 1998, company owner David Black instructed his British Columbia papers to publish a series of editorials opposing the Nisga&#x27;a Treaty, which was the first modern treaty in B.C. history, and not to publish editorials in favor of the treaty.

In January 1999, the NDP government filed a complaint to the B.C. Press Council against Black Press, arguing that its policy breached its duty to act in the public interest and violated the council&#x27;s constitution. Black Press said that news coverage was not affected and editors were free to publish their opinions on their letters page.

The Press Council sided with Black Press based on finding that its newspapers &quot;did in fact carry a diversity of opinion on the Nisga&#x27;a Treaty, including those of Premier Glen Clark, Liberal Leader Gordon Campbell, Reform Party President Bill Vander Zalm as well as those of ordinary British Columbians&quot;.

=== Advertiser concerns ===
In August 2007, a story in the &quot;Victoria News&quot; sparked a complaint from an advertiser and led to the firing/resignation of three senior Black Press employees.
&quot;Victoria News&quot; reporter Brennan Clarke quit the publication after a story he wrote about buying cheaper cars in the United States led to a complaint from Victoria car dealership Dave Wheaton Pontiac Buick GMC. Black Press claimed the article was not balanced, and said that reporters and editors should not purposely jeopardize advertising revenue with their stories, because that revenue pays their salaries. The company also fired the &quot;Victoria News&quot; long-time editor, Keith Norbury, in part because of the complaint, and Black Press&#x27;s Vancouver Island Newsgroup regional editor, Brian Lepine, resigned in protest.

The Canadian Association of Journalists publicly questioned the credibility and independence of the &quot;Victoria News&quot;, wondering how many stories Black Press kills behind the scenes because of advertising concerns.

<doc id="884054" wikidata="Q5076057" url="?curid=884054" title="Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore">
<text>Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore (August 27, 1637 – February 21, 1715) was an English colonial administrator. He inherited the province of Maryland in 1675 upon the death of his father, Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore. He had been his father&#x27;s Deputy Governor since 1661 when he arrived in the colony at the age of 24. However, Charles left Maryland for England in 1684 and would never return. The events following the Glorious Revolution in England in 1688 would cost Calvert his title to Maryland; in 1689 the royal charter to the colony was withdrawn, leading to direct rule by the British Crown. Calvert&#x27;s political problems were largely caused by his Roman Catholic faith which was at odds with the established Church of England.

Calvert married four times, outliving three wives, and had at least two children. He died in England in 1715 at the age of 78, his family fortunes much diminished. With his death he passed his title, and his claim to Maryland, to his second son Benedict Leonard Calvert, 4th Baron Baltimore (1679–1715), his eldest son Cecil having died young. However, Benedict Calvert would outlive his father by just two months, and it would fall to Charles&#x27; grandson, Charles (1699–1751), who converted to the Anglican faith, to see the family proprietorship in the Province of Maryland restored by the king.

==Early life==
Charles was born in England on August 27, 1637, and witnessed the religious conflicts of the English Civil War. His father, Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore (1605–1675), was the first Proprietor Governor of Maryland, and 9th Proprietor Governor of Newfoundland (including &quot;Avalon&quot;, the Calvert&#x27;s earliest colony). His mother was Anne Arundell, (/16–1649), daughter of the 1st Baron Arundell of Wardour (1550–1639).

Anne and Cecil were married in 1627 or 1628, and had nine children. However, only two of Charles&#x27; siblings survived to adulthood, and Anne herself died in 1649 when the young Charles was just 12 years old.

==Maryland==

===Political background===

The Calvert family were Roman Catholics and had founded Maryland as a colony where Catholics and Nonconformist Protestants as well as members of the established Church of England could live together in peace. Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore (1605–1675), had received the proprietorship that was intended for his father, George, who died in 1632 at age 53, shortly before it was granted. Cecil established his colony in Maryland from his home in England, (but sent his younger brother Leonard (1606–1647), as first colonial governor, and as a Roman Catholic continued the legacy of his father by promoting religious tolerance in the colony. He governed Maryland for forty-two years, though he never visited his colony in person.

In 1649, the General Assembly of Maryland, the decade-old colonial legislature passed the Maryland Toleration Act, also known as the &quot;Act Concerning Religion, a law mandating religious tolerance for trinitarian Christians&quot;. Passed on September 21, 1649 by the Assembly of the Maryland colony, it was the first law requiring religious tolerance in the British North American colonies. The Calvert family sought enactment of the law to protect Catholic and other Trinitarian Christians who did not conform to the established Church of England. Religious toleration lasted for approximately 40 years until it was revoked during the Protestant Revolution of 1689. From 1689 until 1776, Maryland was officially Anglican.

===Arrival in Maryland===

Charles Calvert sailed to Maryland in 1661 as a young man of 24, becoming the first of the Barons Baltimore to take personal charge of the colony. He was appointed deputy governor by his father and, when Cecil Calvert died in 1675, Charles inherited Maryland, becoming governor in his own right. Some time before 1666 he was married to Mary Darnall, daughter of Ralph Darnall, and the first of Calvert&#x27;s four wives. The Darnall family were wealthy Maryland planters, and also Roman Catholics. Tragically, Mary did not live long; she died in childbirth sometime before 1667.

Charles was not slow to find a new bride. In 1667, he was married a second time, to Jane Lowe (1644–1693/4), the widow of Colonel Henry Sewall of St Mary&#x27;s County, Maryland, daughter of Vincent Lowe and his wife Anne Cavendish. In late 1667 or early 1668, they had a son, Cecil.

===Economic problems===

Calvert&#x27;s life as governor was aggravated by growing economic problems. From the 1660s onwards, the price of tobacco, the staple crop of Maryland and its chief source of export income, began a long slide, causing economic hardship especially among the poor. In 1666 neighbouring Virginia proposed a &quot;stint&quot; on tobacco growing, a one-year moratorium that would lower supply and so drive up prices. Calvert initially agreed to this plan but came to realize that the burden of the stint would fall chiefly upon his poorest subjects, who comprised &quot;the generality of the province&quot;. Eventually he vetoed the bill, much to the disgust of the Virginians, though in the end Nature provided a stint of her own in the form of a hurricane which devastated the 1667 tobacco crop.

===Religion and politics===

By the time Charles Calvert became governor, the population of the province had gradually become overwhelmingly Protestant due to immigration. Political power however tended to remain concentrated in the hands of the largely Roman Catholic elite. In spite of this demographic shift away from Catholicism, Calvert attempted to preserve Maryland&#x27;s Catholic identity. From 1669 to 1689, of 27 men who sat on the Governor&#x27;s Council, just 8 were Protestant. Most councillors were Catholics, and many were related by blood or marriage to the Calverts, enjoying political patronage and often lucrative offices such as commands in the militia or sinecures in the Land Office.

Much conflict between Calvert and his subjects turned on the question of how far English law should be applied in Maryland, and to what degree the proprietary government might exercise its own prerogative outside of the law. Delegates to the assembly wished to establish the &quot;full force and power&quot; of the law but Calvert, ever protective of his prerogative, insisted that only he and his councillors might decide where and when English law should apply. Such uncertainty could and did permit the charge of arbitrary government.

Calvert acted in various ways to restrain the influence of the Protestant majority. In 1670 he restricted suffrage to men who owned or more, or held property worth more than 40 pounds. He also restricted election to Maryland&#x27;s House of Delegates to those who owned at least 1,000 acres (4 km2) of land. In 1676 he directed the voters to return half as many delegates to the assembly, two instead of four. Measures like these might make the assembly easier to manage, but they tended to strain relations between Calvert and his subjects.

===Slavery===

One of Calvert&#x27;s earliest decisions, regarding the legal position of Africans imported into Maryland, would have long-term and baleful consequences. Although the first Africans had been brought to Maryland in 1642, when 13 slaves arrived at St. Mary&#x27;s City, the first colonial settlement in the region, their legal status was initially unclear and colonial courts tended to rule that a slave who accepted Christian baptism should be freed. In order to protect the rights of their owners, laws began to be passed to clarify the legal position. In 1663 the Assembly ruled that slaves would be enslaved for life, and that the children of slaves should also be enslaved for life, thus perpetuating the institution of slavery for the next 200 years, until its abolition during the American Civil War. However, the impact of such laws would not be felt for some time, as large scale importation of Africans to Maryland would not begin until the 1690s.

===Religious conflicts===
In 1675, the elder (second) Lord Baltimore (Cecilius, who planted the colony of Maryland) died, and Charles Calvert, now 38 years old, returned to London in order to be elevated to his barony. His political enemies now took the opportunity of his absence to launch a scathing attack on the proprietarial government, publishing a pamphlet in 1676, titled &quot;A Complaint from Heaven with a Hue and Crye...out of Maryland and Virginia&quot;, listing numerous grievances, and in particular complaining of the lack of an established church. Neither was the Church of England happy. An Anglican priest, Rev. John Yeo, wrote scathingly to the Archbishop of Canterbury, complaining that Maryland was &quot;in a deplorable condition&quot; and had become &quot;a sodom of uncleanliness and a pesthouse of iniquity&quot;. This was taken sufficiently seriously in London that the Privy Council directed Calvert to respond to the complaints made against him.

Calvert&#x27;s response to these challenges was defiant. He hanged two of the would-be rebels, and moved to re-assert Maryland&#x27;s religious diversity. His written response illustrates the difficulties facing his administration; Calvert wrote that Maryland settlers were &quot;Presbyterians, Independents, Anabaptists, and Quakers, those of the Church of England as well as the Romish being the fewest...it would be a most difficult task to draw such persons to consent unto a Law which shall compel them to maintaine ministers of a contrary perswasion to themselves&quot;.

===Conspiracies===
In 1679, Charles and Jane celebrated a second son, Benedict. But two years later, in 1681, Lord Baltimore once again faced rebellion, led by a former governor of the province Josias Fendall (1657–1660) and John Coode. (Coode would later lead the successful rebellion of 1689.) Fendall was tried, convicted, fined forty thousand pounds of tobacco and exiled, but his co-conspirator Coode successfully escaped retribution.

By this time the political fabric of the province was starting to tear. The governor of Virginia reported that &quot;Maryland is now in torment...and in great danger of falling in pieces&quot;. Relations between the governing council and the assembly grew increasingly poor. Underlying much of the rancour was the continued slide in the price of tobacco, which by the 1680s had fallen 50% in 30 years. In 1681 Baltimore also faced personal tragedy; his eldest son and heir, Cecil, died, leaving his second son Benedict as the heir presumptive to the Calvert inheritance.

===Border conflict with Pennsylvania===

Adding to his difficulties, Calvert found himself embroiled in a serious conflict over land boundaries to the north with William Penn (1644-1718), engaging in a dispute over the border between Maryland and Pennsylvania. In 1681, King Charles II had granted Penn a substantial but rather vague proprietorship to the north of Maryland. Penn however began building his capital city south of the 40th Parallel, in Maryland territory. Penn and Calvert met twice to negotiate a settlement, but were unable to reach agreement. The dispute would outlast both Calvert and Penn, not being resolved until 1769.

===Departure for England===
In 1684, Charles Calvert travelled to England, both to defend himself in the dispute with Penn as well as to answer charges that he favoured Catholics in the colony. He would never return to Maryland.

Calvert left the province in the care of his nephew George Talbot, whom he made acting governor, placing him at the head of the Governor&#x27;s Council. Unfortunately Talbot proved to be a poor choice, stabbing to death a Royal customs official on board his ship in the Patuxent River, and thereby ensuring that his uncle suffered immediate difficulties on his return to London. Calvert&#x27;s replacement for Talbot was another Roman Catholic, William Joseph, who would also prove controversial. In November 1688 Joseph set about offending local opinion by lecturing his Maryland subjects on morality, adultery and the divine right of kings, lambasting the colony as &quot;a land full of adulterers&quot;.

===Glorious Revolution in England===

In England, events now began to move decisively against the Calverts and their political interest. In 1688, the country underwent what would later become known as the Glorious Revolution, during which the Catholic King James II of England was deposed and the Protestant monarchs King William and Mary II of England were installed on the throne. This triumph of the Protestant faction would cause Calvert considerable political difficulties. Sensibly, Calvert moved quickly to support the new regime, sending a messenger to Maryland to proclaim the new King and Queen. Unfortunately for Lord Baltimore, the messenger died during the journey, and a second envoy (if one was ever sent – Calvert would later claim that it was) never arrived.

===Protestant Revolution in Maryland===

Meanwhile, Maryland Protestants, by now a substantial majority in the colony, feeding on rumors from England and fearing Popish plots, began to organize rebellion against the proprietary government. Governor Joseph did not improve the situation by refusing to convene the assembly and, ominously, recalling weapons from storage, ostensibly for repair. Protestants, angry at the apparent lack of official support for the new King and Queen, and resentful of the preferment of Catholics like deputy governor Colonel Henry Darnall to official positions of power, began to arm themselves. In the summer of 1689 an army of 700 Puritans led by Colonel John Coode, and calling themselves the Protestant Associators, defeated a proprietarial army led by Colonel Darnall. Darnall, heavily outnumbered, later wrote: &quot;Wee being in this condition and no hope left of quieting the people thus enraged, to prevent effusion of blood, capitulated and surrendered.&quot;

After this &quot;Protestant Revolution&quot; in Maryland, The victorious Coode and his Protestants allies set up a new government that outlawed Catholicism; Catholics would thereafter be forced to maintain secret chapels in their home in order to celebrate the Mass. In 1704 an Act was passed &quot;to prevent the growth of Popery in this Province&quot;, preventing Catholics from holding political office. Full religious toleration would not be restored in Maryland until the American Revolution, when Darnall&#x27;s great-grandson Charles Carroll of Carrollton, (1737-1832), arguably the wealthiest Catholic in Maryland, signed the American Declaration of Independence along with others on behalf of the new state in Philadelphia in 1776.

John Coode would remain in power until the new royal governor, Nehemiah Blakiston was appointed on July 27, 1691. Charles Calvert himself would never return to Maryland, and, worse, his family&#x27;s royal charter to the colony was withdrawn in 1689.

==Later life==
Calvert&#x27;s political difficulties did not end with the loss of Maryland. In 1694, he was named in connection with the Titus Oates plot, although he successfully evaded arrest. In 1696, his fortunes improved; he was made brigadier general, and then in 1704 rose to the rank of major-general.

Calvert&#x27;s second wife, Jane, died around 1693 or 1694, and Calvert married a third time, to Mary Bankes, some time between 1701 and 1710. His fourth and final marriage was to Margaret Charleton, daughter of Thomas Charleton, in 1712.

Calvert may also have had an illegitimate son, Charles Calvert Lazenby, born in England in 1688, who would grow up to have a career in the army and later become Governor of Maryland in his own right.

Captain Calvert&#x27;s parents have never been positively identified but it has long been assumed that his father was the 3rd Baron Baltimore. This assumption appears to be supported in scholar Anne Yentsch&#x27;s book by the fact that Captain Calvert was granted lands by the 3rd Baron Baltimore, which he then exchanged for a military commission. Likewise, the 5th Baron Baltimore, son of Benedict Leonard Calvert Sr., placed his older cousin as governor of the Maryland Province after he assumed the title at the young age of 15. His mother&#x27;s identity is also unknown but, judging by the Calvert family papers, she appears to have been the Countess Henrietta, also known as &quot;Mother Calvert&quot;, who died circa 1728. However, Douglas Richardson&#x27;s &quot;Plantagenet Ancestry: A Study In Colonial And Medieval Families, 2nd Edition&quot;, p. 467, does not list Lazenby as an illegitimate child of the 3rd Baron; nor any others.

Calvert&#x27;s residence in England was his family&#x27;s estate at Woodcote Park in Surrey. Around 1712, Woodcote was described by Celia Fiennes:
Lord Baltimores in Woodcut Green encompassed with a wall at the entrance, a breast wall with pallisadoes, large courts one within the other, and a back way to the stables where there is a pretty horse pond; the house is old but low, though large run over much ground; as I drove by the side saw broad chimneys on the end and at due distance on the side on both ends the sides of a court which terminated in a building on which there is a lead with railes and barristers.

===Relations with his son Benedict===
Charles remained a Roman Catholic, despite the adverse political disadvantages. But his eldest son Benedict Calvert, 4th Baron Baltimore (1679–1715), did not maintain this allegiance. Benedict correctly calculated that the chief impediment to the restoration of his family&#x27;s title to Maryland was the question of religion. Accordingly, he abandoned Rome and converted to Anglicanism, deciding to &quot;embrace the protestant religion&quot;, and gambling that this move would win back his family&#x27;s lost fortune in the New World. Such a bold move would however come at a high price. Lord Baltimore, furious at his son&#x27;s conversion, withdrew his annual allowance of £450 and ended his support for his grandchildren&#x27;s education and maintenance. However, Charles Calvert died in 1715, passing his title, and his claim to Maryland, to his son Benedict. Charles is buried in the churchyard of St Pancras Old Church in London.

==Legacy==
Upon his father&#x27;s death, Charles&#x27; son, Benedict Calvert, 4th Baron Baltimore, petitioned King George I, (1660–1727), for the restoration of his family&#x27;s proprietarial title to Maryland. Unfortunately, before the king could rule on the petition, Benedict died, just two months after his father, passing on his title in turn to his son Charles.

On May 15, 1715, Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore soon found himself, at age sixteen, in the fortunate position of having had his family&#x27;s proprietarial title to Maryland restored by the King. In 1721, he came of age and assumed personal control of the Colony, which would remain under the control of the Calvert family until 1776 and the American Revolution.
Charles County, Maryland, was named after him.

Charles Calvert&#x27;s very large full-length portrait, along with those of all the other Lords Baltimore (collected by philanthropist Hugh Young), all still hang today in the skylighted Great Hall of the central Enoch Pratt Free Library on Cathedral Street in downtown Baltimore, the city that bears his family name (along with several others usually with the prefix of &quot;New&quot; attached across America), along with frequent historical and ceremonial commemorations of the colonial proprietors.

<text>Penne alla vodka () is a pasta dish of penne in vodka sauce: a tomato and cream sauce with some vodka, and sometimes small meats and vegetables such as sausage, pancetta or peas. Sometimes other pasta shapes are used. The alcohol is said to intensify and accentuate flavors in the dish, the alcohol would normally cook off as in most cooking and the dish would not necessarily contain any alcohol. It is usually topped with grated Parmesan cheese in amount as desired, as with ground pepper.

The recipe became very popular in Italy and in the United States around the 1980s, when it was offered to discothèque customers. The recipe thus became an icon of the fashionable cuisine of the time, which preferred the use of cream in first courses. &quot;Penne alla vodka&quot; remains popular in Italian-American cuisine.

==Origins==

The exact origins of &quot;penne alla vodka&quot; are unclear, and to some extent the subject of urban legend and folklore. The first use of vodka in a pasta dish recorded in a cookbook is attested to 1974, when the Italian actor Ugo Tognazzi published the cookbook &quot;L&#x27;Abbuffone&quot; (meaning &#x27;the bouffe-men&#x27;, named after Tognazzi&#x27;s movie &quot;La Grande Bouffe&quot;), which included his recipe of &quot;pasta all&#x27;infuriata&quot; (), described as a sort of &quot;pasta all&#x27;arrabbiata&quot;, made with ½ kg of penne, ½ kg of fresh peeled tomatoes, a shot of vodka, chili pepper, oil, garlic, and bay leaves. Tognazzi suggested also that, if using a Polish vodka with chilli (&quot;formidable, tremendous, very strong, very hot, deadly&quot;), the fresh chilli pepper can be omitted.

There have been multiple, often conflicting, claims to the invention and history of the dish; one author claims that it was invented at Dante, a restaurant in Bologna. One cookbook claims that it was invented in the 1980s by a Roman chef for a vodka company that wanted to popularize its product in Italy. The dish may have been common in Italy before becoming popular in America in the early 1980s.

On October 25, 2016, the Italian Association of Confectionery and Pasta Industries named it the symbolic dish of the 18th World Pasta Day organized in Moscow, as symbol of friendship between Italy and Russia. Barilla later found &quot;penne alla vodka&quot; was the second most sought-after dish of pasta in search engines, behind only &quot;pasta alla bolognese&quot;.

==Composition==
The sauce consists of tomato sauce combined with cream, an unusual combination in Italian cooking.

The ethanol of the vodka enhances and balances the flavors of the tomato and cream.

Similar tomato and cream sauces without vodka are sometimes known as &quot;parma rosa&quot; or &quot;rosatella&quot;.

==In media==

&quot;Disco Sauce: The True Story of Penne Alla Vodka&quot; was released in 2022 by director Roberto Serrini. The documentary examines the history, composition and variations of &quot;penne alla vodka&quot;. The film features chef Pasquale Cozzolino, chef Gaetano Arnone, chef Jae Lee, chef JJ Johnson, chef Jeremy Spector and molecular gastronomist Hervé This. &quot;Disco Sauce&quot; is a platinum Viddy, Platinum MarCom and Taste Award winner.

The May 4th, 2024, episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; featured a sketch about penne alla vodka in which it was depicted as a tolerated, but not particularly good, dish often served at events such as weddings, funerals, and anniversaries.

<text>The Land Rover Discovery is a series of five or seven-seater family SUVs, produced under the Land Rover marque, from the British manufacturer Land Rover, and later Jaguar Land Rover. The series is currently in its fifth iteration (or generation, according to the manufacturer), the first of which was introduced in 1989, making the Discovery the first new model series since the launch of the 1970 Range Rover – on which it was based – and only the third new product line since the conception of the Land Rover (vehicle and brand) by Rover in 1948. The model is sometimes called influential, as one of the first to market a true off-road capable family car.

Although the Range Rover had originally been designed as an everyday four wheel drive car that could be used as both a utility vehicle and a family car, it had progressively moved upmarket through its life to evolve into a luxury vehicle sold at a much higher price point. The Discovery was intended to fulfill the role the Range Rover originally was intended for; a segment which was now dominated by Japanese rivals such as the Nissan Patrol, Mitsubishi Pajero and Toyota Land Cruiser. Although positioned below the Range Rover in the company&#x27;s line-up, the vehicle was both longer and higher, offered more room in the back, and optionally also more seats. Space utilization became more sophisticated in later generations, but the series keeps offering seats for seven occupants. Despite originally being sold as an affordable alternative to the Range Rover, the Discovery has also progressively moved upmarket through its successive generations to become a bonafide luxury SUV.

The second Discovery (1998) was called the Series II, and although it featured an extended rear overhang, it was otherwise an extensive facelift, which carried over the wheelbase frame and rigid, live front and rear axles derived from the original Range Rover.

The third generation – succeeding the Series II in 2004 - was either called the Discovery 3 or simply LR3 (in North America and the Middle East). This was a new ground up design, the first all-original design for the Discovery. Although it followed the 2002 third generation Range Rover, also switching to fully independent suspension, it still received a separate, but integrated body and frame (IBF) structure. The fourth generation, as of 2009 – like the series II, was again mainly an update of the new generation – marketed as the Discovery 4, or Land Rover LR4 for North American and Middle Eastern markets.

The fifth generation of the Discovery, introduced in 2017, no longer sports a numeric suffix. Unlike the previous two generations, it now benefits from a unitized body structure, making it lighter than its predecessor.


== First &amp; Second generation Discovery ==

=== Discovery Series I (1989–1998) ===
The Discovery Series I was conspicuously presented during the 1989 Frankfurt Motor Show and introduced to market in the United Kingdom in October that year, after the vehicle had been developed under the internal code-name &quot;Project Jay&quot;. The new model was strongly based on the more upmarket Range Rover, using the same chassis, suspension and 4WD-system, and a derivative body design – especially the four-door copied much of the more expensive Range Rover&#x27;s body structure. However, with smaller engines available, just two short side doors at introduction, and other cost-reductions, the new Discovery was priced more affordably, for a larger, more middle-class market segment, intended to counter the Japanese competition at the time.

The Discovery was Land Rover&#x27;s first model that was positioned as a family car, designed to be both fully off-road capable and suitable as a daily driver for any family, even offering more luggage space and optionally more seats than the Range Rover. The Mark I Discovery remains the only model offered as a three-door, and was the only one available with a four-cylinder petrol engine until 2017.

At launch, the Discovery was only available as a three-door model; the original 64 press demonstrator examples (carrying Gxxx WAC license numbers - hence being nicknamed &quot;G-WAC&quot;s by Land Rover enthusiasts) are increasingly prized. The five-door version followed in 1990. Both were fitted with five seats, with the option to have two jump seats fitted in the boot. Compared to the Range Rover, the Discovery was given a slightly longer rear which was further extended on the series II. In order to make room for optional third row jump seats, the spare wheel had to move to the outside of the car, fitted to a side-swinging rear door, instead of the Range Rover&#x27;s split tailgate. The roof of the rear section of the car was raised, to create sufficient headroom in the third row. Combined with a safari side window cluster, this gave the Discovery its own distinct look and profile.

Land Rover employed an external consultancy, Conran Design Group, to design the interior. They were instructed to ignore current car interior design and position the vehicle as a &#x27;lifestyle accessory&#x27;. Their interior incorporated a number of original features, although some ideas shown on the original interior mock-ups (constructed inside a Range Rover bodyshell at Conran&#x27;s workshops) were left on the shelf, such as a custom sunglasses holder built into the centre of the steering wheel. The design was unveiled to critical acclaim and won a British Design Award in 1989.

The original transmission was a dual-ratio five-speed manual with drive via a transfer case with a lockable centre differential.

Initially – and regardless of exterior colour choice – much of the interior in all Discovery&#x27;s was trimmed in light &#x27;Sonar Blue&#x27; upholstery and plastic, with magazine holders above the windscreen, hand-holds for rear passengers incorporated into the head restraints of the front seats, remote radio controls on the instrument cluster, twin removable sunroof panels (including a special zip-up storage bag behind the rear seats) and a Land Rover-branded cloth fabric holdall in the front centre console for oddments storage that could be removed from the vehicle and worn as a handbag using a supplied shoulder strap (relatively few of these bags have survived, making them collectable items). However, most of all of the interior and dashboard components came either from the Range Rover or from other Rover Group cars - for example the switchgear and instrument pod were from the Maestro and Montego; the digital clock from the Metro, the dashboard air vents were from the Rover 800 and the heater/air conditioning control panel was from the Range Rover. Similarly, the Discovery utilised several Range Rover body panels - most notably the door shells and window frames, but with different aluminium skin panels, retaining the distinctive Morris Marina door handles. Other standard parts used were the headlights from the Freight Rover van and tail lights from the Austin Maestro van. The latter would continue to bear the Austin Rover &#x27;chevron&#x27; logo on their lenses until production of the first generation Discovery ended in 1998, ten years after Austin Rover ceased to exist.

In 1992, the Discovery received several additions and improvements. The interior was offered in a more traditional beige as well as the distinctive (but controversial) light blue, an automatic gearbox was made available on 200Tdi models, new colours were added to the range (and the large &#x27;compass and mountain&#x27; side decals worn by early Discoveries to disguise wavy panel fit around the rear three quarter windows were no longer fitted) and the &#x27;SE&#x27; pack (incorporating alloy wheels, front driving lights, roof bars and a special range of metallic paints) was introduced as an option. A two-seater, three-door Discovery Commercial version, lacking rear-side windows, was later offered by Land Rover Special Vehicles.

Before 1994, the Discovery was available with either the 2.5-litre 200 Tdi engine or the 3.5-litre Rover V8. Early V8 engines used a twin SU carburettor system, switching to Lucas 14CUX fuel injection in 1990. A 2.0-litre petrol engine from the Rover stable was briefly available in a model known as the 2.0-litre Mpi I4. This was intended to attract fleet managers, since UK (and Italian) tax laws benefitted vehicles under 2.0 litres. A combination of changes in taxation and lack of power for such a heavy vehicle led to the demise of this engine, despite its fitting to several Discoveries supplied to the British royal family. One of these was notably driven by Prince Philip around Windsor Great Park, in his position as Park Ranger.

The transmission was a permanent four-wheel drive system, with a high and low range transfer box, locking centre differential at the transfer box. Similarly to the rest of the Land Rover range, the handbrake acts on the transmission at the back of the transfer box, therefore locking the rear prop shaft or both front and rear prop shafts if the central differential lock is engaged.

In Australia, the Series I launched in April 1991, available only as a three-door estate in 3.5-litre V8i guise with and and coupled with a five-speed manual gearbox. In October 1991, Land Rover launched the five-door body variant in base V8i and luxury HL versions. Both featured central locking, electric windows, headlight washers and heated door mirrors, with the HL adding alloy wheels, air conditioning, driving lights and an improved audio system. Furthermore, the Tdi engine became available, rated at and . In early 1993, a four-speed automatic option was added to the Australian range and the HL was discontinued.

;1994 update
In 1994, many changes were made to the Discovery. It reached some markets as the &quot;Discovery 2&quot;; the 200Tdi and 3.5 L V8 engines were replaced with the 2.5 L 300Tdi 4-cylinder and 3.9-litre Rover V8 engines. The 300Tdi introduced a Bosch electronic emissions control for certain models and markets. At around this time, a stronger R380 gearbox was fitted to all manual models. The newer models featured larger headlamps and a second set of rear lights in the bumper. The new rear lights had their wiring configuration changed several times to meet real or expected European safety legislation. Some vehicles were left with an arrangement where the vulnerable bumper contains the only working direction-indicator lights; other examples have these lights duplicated in the traditional rear pillar location. The interior was completely revised, dispensing with most of the Conran-designed original. An all new &quot;soft feel&quot; dashboard was introduced (a derivative of which was also used in the run-out Range Rover Classic), which replaced most of the components from the Maestro and Montego with the switchgear and instrument pack now coming from the R17-series Rover 800. The new design allowed the fitment of airbags and a proper locking glove box replaced the zip bag of the original interior.

;North America
The 1994 model year marked the first year that the Land Rover Discovery was sold in the United States. Airbags were incorporated into the design of the 1994 model to meet the requirements of US motor vehicle safety regulations, though they were not fitted as standard in all markets. All North American specification (NAS) models were fitted with the 3.9-litre V8 from the Range Rover SE models, and later models saw a change to the 4.0-litre version of the engine.

Technically speaking, the 1996-98 US models with 4.0-litre engines had the same displacement as the 3.9-litre engines fitted to the earlier 1994-95 US models; the differences between the engines involved improvements to the block rigidity and pistons, and a change from the Lucas 14CUX engine management to the distributor-less Generic Engine Management System (&quot;GEMS&quot;). In earlier 3.9-litre US engines, the fuel injection computer (14CUX) did not control the ignition, which was instead controlled by a traditional system with an ignition coil and distributor made by Lucas. The GEMS system was developed jointly by Lucas and SAGEM; it controlled both spark timing and fuel injection. Unlike the earlier systems fitted to Rover V8 engines, GEMS was made OBD-II compliant. This change was largely driven by the federal requirement (starting in 1996) for vehicles sold in the United States to meet the OBD-II specification.

;Other versions
In Japan, a badge-engineered version of the Discovery I was offered, called the Honda Crossroad. The Rover companies had a cross-holding relationship with Honda UK since the early-1980s. The relationship ended after Rover was taken over by German carmaker BMW in 1994. (Honda revived the nameplate &#x27;Crossroad&#x27; in another small sport utility vehicle in 2007).

In the Republic of Ireland, local tax laws meant that the first ever example of a Discovery Commercial (van) was launched there in 1991. A revised version was launched in 1993, shortly after the UK market example of late 1992. The Irish examples have formed the basis of the Discovery&#x27;s success and high sales there, as commercial models are on a much lower tax band.

;Special editions
* Country Life &quot;(Switzerland, 1991)&quot;: The Country Life was a five-door V8i Discovery with special interior trim, including a leather-wrapped Nardi steering wheel, wood door and console trim, and identifying decals. It also included a picnic basket. A total of 50 Country Life editions were built.
* Orienteer &quot;(Australia, 1992)&quot;: The Orienteer models were all three-door, equipped with the V8 engine. They were fitted with five-spoke alloy wheels and driving lights, and &quot;compass&quot; side graphics. 75 Orienteer Discoveries were built; because they sold out quickly, this special edition was offered again for the 1993 model year.
* Freestyle &quot;(France, 1993)&quot;: The Freestyle was available as either a three-door or five-door, and all were painted metallic blue and adorned with Freestyle decals. They were fitted with front and rear anti-roll bars and the &quot;Freestyle&quot; five-spoke alloy wheels.
* County Rider &quot;(France, 1993)&quot;: Intended to appeal to equestrians, the County Rider was equipped with a rear floor liner, rub-strips and wheel-arch protectors, mudflaps, floor mats, an adjustable towbar, and a saddle rack. Available as either a three- or five-door, all were painted green with special decals.
* Rossignol &quot;(Australia, 1993)&quot;: Named for Skis Rossignol, this was a three-door V8i painted in Caprice blue-green metallic and fitted with a ski rack. It was also fitted with rub strips, wheel arch protectors, and other items that were optional on the base models.
* Camel Trophy &quot;(Japan, 1995)&quot;: All were painted Sandglow Yellow, and built with roof racks to which were fitted metal Camel Trophy plates. Available was either the V8 with automatic gearbox, or 300Tdi diesel with five-speed manual.
* Sunseeker &quot;(Germany, 1996)&quot;: Fitted with a chromed front bullbar and painted metallic blue with special decals. All were in the five-door configuration with deep-dish alloy wheels.
* Goodwood &quot;(UK, 1997)&quot;: Before it was discovered that the name &quot;Goodwood&quot; was controlled by the owners of the Goodwood Circuit, Land Rover had already planned production of 500 Goodwood special edition examples. They were painted British Racing Green (renamed to &quot;Goodwood Green&quot;) with coachlines and special badging, and trimmed with a leather-wrapped steering wheel and walnut interior accents. All were also fitted with dished alloy wheels. Because of the legal objection to the use of the Goodwood name, the single unit built for the London Motor Show was the only one actually badged as such and the remaining 499 were left unnamed.
* Horse and Hound &quot;(UK, 1997)&quot;: Twenty of these were produced, as a result of a joint promotional effort between Lex Land Rover (of Maidenhead) and Horse &amp; Hound magazine. All were five-door Tdi models with an individual series number and special decals.
* Argyll &quot;(UK, 1997)&quot;: Available as either a V8i or Tdi and painted either Oxford Blue or Woodcote Green. Re-introduced in 1998 as a three-door variant.
* XD &quot;(US, 1997)&quot;: 250 built by Land Rover Special Vehicles for the North American market. Based on the SD trim package; automatic transmission, no sunroofs, manual cloth seats, and deleted roof bars. Features included AA Yellow paint, &quot;XD&quot; embroidered seat covers, spare tyre cover with &quot;XD&quot; logo, low-profile Safety Devices roof rack, brush guard, skid plate, and an optional &quot;event decal package&quot; installed by dealers.
* Aviemore &quot;(UK, 1998)&quot;: Base on the seven-seat GS model, the Aviemore had special badging and was available as either British Racing Green over beige cloth or Rioja Red over grey cloth. It was also equipped with dished alloy wheels and a heated windscreen.
* Anniversary 50 &quot;(UK, 1998)&quot;: Designed to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of Land Rover, this edition had special fiftieth anniversary badging and either Atlantis Blue or White Gold paint. The interior was Lightstone leather, and the wheels were the &quot;Boost&quot; style alloy design. It was built as a V8 automatic or Tdi (with either the automatic or manual gearbox.)
* Safari &quot;(UK, 1998)&quot;: Again based on the seven-seat GS, the Safari was painted Epsom Green and was equipped with a rear ladder, roof rails, and additional fog lamps. It was available with either the V8 or Tdi engine, although the manual gearbox was only offered in conjunction with the Tdi. A total of 1,100 were built.
* Trophy &quot;(Netherlands)&quot;
* Camel Trophy &quot;(Germany, 1998)&quot;: Painted Sandglow Yellow with &quot;Tornado&quot; style alloy wheels. Equipped with a snorkel air intake, trail lamps, a roof rack, a ladder, and a bullbar.
* Trophy &quot;(Germany, 1998)&quot;: Not to be confused with the &quot;Camel Trophy&quot; edition also available in Germany during the same year, the &quot;Trophy&quot; had alloy wheels and air conditioning, twin airbags, a front bar with additional lamps, and a special spare tyre cover. The Trophy was only available with the 300Tdi engine.
* Esquire &quot;(Germany, 1998)&quot;: Like the Trophy, the Esquire was equipped with twin airbags, air conditioning, and alloy wheels, but it was also standardised with ABS and the interior was trimmed with wood and leather.

=== Discovery Series II (L318; 1998–2004) ===
The Series II Discovery debuted in autumn 1998, four years after BMW&#x27;s acquisition of Rover Group from British Aerospace in 1994. Land Rover promoted that the Discovery Series II had been modified with 720 &#x27;differences&#x27;. The interior and exterior were reworked to be less utilitarian, but it was still clearly an evolution of the Series I. Every body panel had been altered, except the outer skin on the rear doors. The rear body was extended to improve load space, and to now accommodate full-size adults on all seven seats on the SE7 option, as well as make them all forward facing, but at the expense of added rear overhang, which slightly reduced the car&#x27;s departure angle when off-roading.

The Discovery Series II was the last Land Rover SUV to use an evolution of the original 1970 Range Rover underpinnings – with its extended, long, four-door body still riding on the same, relatively short wheelbase, ladder-frame chassis, combined with live axles front and rear, into 2004.

Changes to the diesel-engined models saw the 2,495 cc Td5 (in-line direct-injected straight-five engine) introduced, in line with the updated Defender models. This electronically managed engine was smoother, producing more usable torque at lower revs than its 300Tdi predecessor. The Td5 engine is often mistakenly attributed to BMW but it was derived from the Rover L-series passenger car engine and further developed by Land Rover. The 3,948 cc V8 petrol version from the Discovery 1 was replaced with the Range Rover P38 Thor 4.0-litre, Rover-derived V8. There was no actual increase in capacity over the previous 3.9-litre engine. Although the basic design of the engine was similar, it was actually quite different internally: it used a different crankshaft, had larger bearing journals with cross bolted caps, different connecting rods, and different pistons. The blocks were machined differently, to accept extra sensors for the Gems and Bosch (Thor) injection system and to allow the extra stroke of the 4.6 crankshaft. For the 2003 and 2004 model year, the Discovery II changed to the 4.6-litre V8 (though the only V8 offered in the UK continued to be the 4.0).

ACE (Active Cornering Enhancement, an electronically controlled hydraulic anti-roll bar system) was fitted to some versions, which reduced cornering roll. A pair of accelerometers are used to detect the angle of body lean and to instruct the ACE computer to counteract these movements by applying pressure to the vehicle&#x27;s torsion bars via actuators which are hydraulically controlled. On the Land Rover Discovery, the ACE system can counteract up 1 G of lateral acceleration in less than a tenth of a second, thus helping the vehicle become more stable and responsive during hard cornering. Self-levelling air springs were fitted to some models and European type-approval for seven-seat vehicles was only given to air-sprung examples.

The locking center differential was still fitted although the actual mechanism linkage was not on the early series II production, as Land Rover believed that the traction control system [TCS] and newly developed Hill Descent Control system [HDC] would render it redundant. It was fully reinstated (with the linkage) on the facelift model in 2002, as a cost option (although standard equipment on high spec vehicles). Whilst the traction control system worked very effectively, it did not offer the same level of control and smooth operation as the vehicles fitted with the differential lock. Customer demand saw the diff lock controls fully reinstated on UK and Irish models, and aftermarket kits are offered by several vendors for those vehicles which were produced with the lock, but not the linkage.

For 2003 and 2004, the US version was available in three trim levels: S, SE, and HSE. Those with the seven-seat option were known as the S7, SE7, and HSE7.

The &quot;facelift&quot; models are easily identified by new &quot;pocketed&quot; headlamps (which matched the Range Rover and facelifted Freelander models) as well as redesigned turn and brake lamps on the rear of the vehicle. The indicators were moved from the bumper to the high side fixtures. The earlier Series II models could in turn be easily distinguished from the original Discovery by the position of those stop light fixtures above the window-line (earlier models had them below), and by the replacement of paddle door handles with the current sort. The Series II also differs slightly in dimensions.

A small number of Discovery II Commercial models were produced by Land Rover Special Vehicles, this time based on the five-door bodyshell but with the windows rendered opaque to give van-like appearance and security. Normal vehicles were exported to Republic of Ireland, where the rear-side windows were smashed and rear seats were destroyed in the presence of a Revenue official, to offer a model that avoided the Vehicle Registration Tax (saving approximately 40%). The UK Commercials came with rear self-levelling suspension as standard (an option that has in the meantime been deleted from these vehicles in subsequent ownership due to reliability issues.)

In the final production run of the Discovery II, only three models were offered for sale in the UK market, referred to in Land Rover publicity as &quot;Definitive Editions&quot;. The &#x27;base&#x27; Pursuit, which still retained a high level of equipment as standard, and the medium specification Landmark, which offered an all-leather interior, twin sunroofs, Active Cornering Enhancement, six-disc CD player, and a heated windscreen, and the highest spec ES Premium which included satellite navigation, harman/kardon hi-fi, &quot;Aero&quot; roof bars, stainless steel side runners, rear parking sensors and a wooden centre console. The final vehicles left the production lines in late-May 2004 to make way for the all new Discovery 3 (LR3) models.

== Third generation (L319) &amp; Fourth generation Discovery ==

=== Discovery 3 / LR3 (2004–2009) ===
On 2 April 2004, almost four years after Ford&#x27;s acquisition of Land Rover from BMW, Land Rover introduced the Discovery 3, marketed as the LR3 in North America and the Middle East, and had its international debut at the British International Motorshow in May. It retained the key features of the Discovery, such as the stepped roofline and steeply raked windscreen. The LR3 name was chosen for North American and Middle Eastern markets due to negative quality associations with the Discovery name and (according to Land Rover) a preference in the American market for alpha-numeric model designations – the second generation Freelander was also redesignated for the North American and Middle Eastern market as the LR2.

Land Rover developed a body construction method for the Discovery 3, marketed as Integrated Body Frame (IBF). The engine bay and passenger compartment are built as a monocoque, then mated to a basic ladder-frame chassis for the gearbox and suspension. Land Rover claims IBF combines the virtues of monocoque and ladder-frame – though it makes for a heavier vehicle than a monocoque construction, compromising performance and agility somewhat but adding strength, toughness and adaptability.

The LR3 features full independent suspension (FIS). Like the Range Rover L322, this is an air suspension system, enabling ride-height adjustment by simply pumping up or deflating the air bags. The vehicle can be raised to provide ground clearance when off-road, but lowered at high speeds to improve handling. Land Rover developed &#x27;cross-linked&#x27; air suspension. When needed, the suspension mimics the action of a beam axle (as one wheel drops, the other rises). If the chassis of the vehicle contacts the ground when the suspension was at its &#x27;off-road&#x27; height, the system senses the reduction in load on the air springs and raises the vehicle an extra inch. In the UK and European markets, a coil-spring independent suspension system was offered on the base model. This model was unique in the range by having only five seats and only being available with the 2.7-litre diesel engine. This model lacked the Terrain Response system.

The engines used in the Discovery 3 were all taken from Land Rover&#x27;s sister company at the time, Jaguar. A Ford/PSA-developed 2.7-litre, , V6 diesel engine (the TdV6) was intended to be the biggest seller in Europe. For the US market and as the high-performance option elsewhere, a 4.4-litre petrol V8 of was chosen. A 4.0-litre SOHC Ford V6 petrol engine was available in North America and Australia.

The gearboxes on the Discovery 3 were also all-new. For the diesel engine, a six-speed manual transmission was standard. As an option, and as standard on the V8 engine, a six-speed automatic transmission was available. Both came with a two-speed transfer box and permanent four-wheel-drive. A computer controlled progressively locking central differential ensured traction was retained in tough conditions. A similar differential was available on the rear axle to aid traction.

The Discovery 3 was fitted with multiple electronic traction control systems. Hill Descent Control (HDC) prevented vehicle &#x27;runaways&#x27; when descending steep gradients and 4-wheel Electronic Traction Control (4ETC) prevented wheel spin in low-traction conditions. An on-road system, Dynamic Stability Control (DSC), prevented skidding when steering and braking at speed. The vehicle also featured the &#x27;Terrain Response&#x27; system. Previously, off-road driving had been a skill that many drivers found daunting. A wide-ranging knowledge of the vehicle was needed to be able to select the correct gear, transfer ratio, various differential systems and master various techniques required for tackling steep hills, deep water and other tough terrain. Terrain Response attempted to take away as many of the difficulties as possible. The driver selected a terrain type (&quot;Sand&quot;, &quot;Grass, Gravel &amp; Snow&quot;, &quot;Mud &amp; Ruts&quot; and &quot;Rock Crawl&quot;) on a dial in the cab of the vehicle. The on-board computer systems then select the correct gearbox settings, adjust the suspension height, adjust the differential lock settings and even alter the throttle response of the engine suitable for the terrain. For example, in &quot;Rock Crawl&quot;, the suspension is raised to its maximum height and set to allow maximum wheel articulation, the differentials are locked, the driver is prompted to switch to Low Range, and the throttle response is altered to provide low-speed control. In &quot;Sand&quot; mode, the traction control system is &#x27;primed&#x27; to be more sensitive to wheelspin, the differentials are partly locked, and the throttle response is re-mapped to produce high power outputs with short pedal movement. The driver retained some manual control over the off-road systems, being able to select the Transfer Box ratio and the suspension height manually, although use of the Terrain Response system is needed to allow full use of the vehicles&#x27; capabilities.

As well as new mechanical and electronic systems, the Discovery 3 introduced a new design to the interior and exterior of the vehicle. The Discovery 3 was able to have a fresh, minimalist style. The interior featured a flexible seven-seat layout. Passengers in the rearmost row now entered through the rear side doors, instead of the tailgate as in previous versions. The driver benefitted from a DVD navigation system, including some optional features like Bluetooth telephony in later models. Like the Range Rover, this audio, information &amp; entertainment (&quot;infotainment&quot;) system in the Discovery 3 adopted an electronics architecture whereby the system&#x27;s distributed control units pass information and audio amongst one another and throughout the vehicle via optical links based on the MOST (or, Media Oriented Systems Transport) fibre-optic automotive networking standard (informally called the &quot;MOST-bus&quot;). The system&#x27;s navigation functions were unique to Land Rover because, in addition to the typical road map navigation, benefits included an off-road navigation and four-wheel drive information mode. When in four-wheel drive information mode, the screen showed a schematic of the vehicle, displaying the amount of suspension movement, angle the front wheels were steering, the status of the locking differentials and icons showing which mode the Terrain Response was in, and what gear was selected on automatic versions.

The vehicle was lauded by the press, with the Terrain Response system, improved on-road dynamics, and interior design receiving particular praise. Jeremy Clarkson of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top Gear&quot; motoring show drove one to the top of Cnoc an Fhreiceadain, a mountain near Tongue in northern Scotland, where no vehicle had previously reached. Richard Hammond, presenter of Top Gear, praised it as the &quot;Best 4X4 of all time&quot;. In Australia, the vehicle was awarded &quot;4WD of the Year&quot; by the 4WD Press.

The Discovery 3 was planned to be assembled from complete knock-down kits at Ford&#x27;s Vsevolozhsk plant in Russia, but the project was cancelled in 2007.

In 2006, Land Rover used the Discovery 3 in its G4 challenge, alongside the Range Rover Sport. The vehicles used were all in standard mechanical form, except for the fitment of additional Land Rover off-road equipment.

The first all-new model placement since the Freelander, the Range Rover Sport is based on the Discovery 3 platform, rather than on the larger Range Rover.

A 2008–2009 facelifted model of the Discovery 3 offered a Harman/Kardon stereo system upgrade, six-CD changer, clear side indicator lights, and body-colour bumpers.

A driverless version of the LR3 finished 4th in the DARPA Urban Challenge.

=== Discovery 4 / LR4 (2009–2016) ===
The Discovery 4 (called LR4 in North America and the Middle East) is an updated version of the Discovery 3.
Using the same Integrated Body Frame structure, the new Discovery has altered front and rear light units and a restyled front grille and bumper to adopt the same smoother, rounder style as also adopted for the 2010 Range Rover and Range Rover Sport. The Discovery 4 also retains the body-coloured wheel arches and bumpers as the late Discovery 3s (early D3s had black plastic trim). Optional Daylight Running Lamps can be specified whilst LED lights feature prominently in both front and rear lamp units.

The majority of the changes are mechanical, with reliability issues addressed, improvements to engines and gearboxes, brake and suspension refinements, but also included major interior upgrades with a more luxurious and contemporary interior with greater luxury and technology levels available. The D4 receives two engines from Jaguar Land Rover&#x27;s &quot;Gen III&quot; range. The TDV6 Gen III is a 3.0-litre development of the 2.7-litre engine used in the D3. The new version features advanced twin-sequential turbochargers where a Variable geometry turbocharger is used at low engine speeds, with a second standard turbo is brought online at higher engine speeds. Two versions of the 3.0-litre diesel are offered. Fuel economy was improved over the previous generation diesel while power, torque and diesel NVH were improved significantly. This system provides greater output than the older engine, with and whilst reducing emissions by 10 per cent when first introduced and in 2014 increased to . The Gen III version of the V8 petrol engine (available in markets outside the UK such as North America, Russia, Japan, Australia, and some EU countries) is now a 5-litre unit with Direct Petrol Injection developing and . The base 4.0-litre V6 was still available on some Asian markets in 2009–2013.

An improved version of the ZF six-speed automatic/sequential gearbox was incorporated and in 2012 (2014 in the US) was further improved including a change to 8 speeds. It includes taller gearing to take advantage of the new engines&#x27; greater torque output and an updated lock-up system to further reduce fuel consumption. Other technical changes include the fitting of the more powerful brakes from the Range Rover Sport and thicker anti-roll bars to improve on-road handling. The Stability Control System now includes a programme that detects the onset of understeer and applies the brakes. The Discovery 4 retains its predecessor&#x27;s fully independent air suspension with cross-linking when off-road and the twin-range transfer gearbox with an electronic infinitely variable locking centre differential. As before, a similar locking rear differential is available. The Terrain Response system remains but with two new features – the &#x27;Sand&#x27; mode incorporates a new traction control mode to prevent loss of traction when starting off and stopping in soft sand, and the &#x27;Rock Crawl&#x27; mode gains a feature that applies gentle brake pressure at low (less than walking pace) speeds to improve grip and stability on slick rock. The system is also &#x27;retuned&#x27; to account for the new engines and gearboxes with their different torque characteristics. Other new electronic systems include Trailer Stability Assist which can adjust the throttle and brakes to prevent a dangerously swaying trailer.

The 2.7-litre TDV6 engine was available in Europe on the basic 2.7 GS passenger and 2010 Commercial ranges. Unlike the Discovery 3 base model, this was equipped with air suspension and the Terrain Response system. The automatic gearbox was an option on this model. The 3.0-litre Gen III model (only with automatic gearbox) is also available in the GS trim level.

The Discovery 4 also features a redesigned interior (in keeping with the new styles introduced elsewhere in the LR range for 2010). The instrument cluster is updated with redesigned analogue speedometer and tachometer gauges for improved clarity. The analogue temperature/fuel gauges of the previous model and the electronic information display are replaced by a single TFT screen capable of displaying information in a variety of modes and formats. The interior also has a new centre console, which includes redesigned and simplified switches and controls. The Discovery also has a new seat design and a wider range of available interior materials – some previously only seen in Range Rover models. The stated aim of the interior redesign was to lift the vehicle upmarket, with higher-spec models now aimed at the luxury and executive markets.

The car gains some electronic systems from the Range Rover lineup, such as the optional &#x27;Surround Camera System&#x27; – a series of cameras located in the front bumper, door mirrors, and rear tailgate handle which can display their images on the centre console screen to improve visibility (although the image quality of this system was downgraded by Land Rover around 2014). Other electronic systems are intended to improve efficiency – the engines feature a &#x27;Smart&#x27; alternator that only charges the battery when engine load is low, thus helping to reduce fuel consumption when the engine is working harder.

The Discovery 4 was unveiled in the summer of 2009 and went on sale in the United Kingdom on 1 September that year. A Commercial van variant was released in the UK at the same time using the 2.7 engine and offered in GS and XS trim levels. In the Republic of Ireland, a Commercial van was offered from 1 January 2010 based on the XE 2.7 manual and HSE 3.0 auto engines.

An armoured Discovery with B6 ballistic level of protection was announced in 2010. It offers numerous safety features designed to protect the occupants, including protection from grenades and small arms fire. The vehicle is indistinguishable from the standard LR4.&lt;ref name=&quot;Discovery 4/LR4 Sentinel&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2011 model year, announced in late 2010, the 2.7-litre engine was dropped and two versions of the 3.0-litre engine were made available – one called the TDV6 and one called the SDV6 (the latter offering ).

For the 2012 model year, diesel models in Europe came with the new eight-speed auto gearbox with steering wheel paddle controls and a circular dial selector that raises upon startup. The SDV6 engine was uprated to whilst both diesel engines featured reduced emissions for European models. During 2012 the HSE Luxury special edition was announced, featuring enhanced trim levels, and available in Europe and North American markets.

In Ireland, 2012 saw the introduction of a new five-seat version of the Discovery 4 classified as an N1 Commercial vehicle, therefore attracting lower VRT rates. There is also a new two-seat Commercial on the same rules. All Irish models came with the lower emissions TDV6 engine. In 2014, an enhanced version of the unique-to-Ireland five-seater commercial utility went on sale which included almost all top-of-the-range features for a lower price. This vehicle is now the top selling Discovery in Ireland due to the fact that it attracts low road tax ( per year) and VAT can be reclaimed.

For 2013, models received a style freshening, new badging, new fuel stretching technology, improved audio systems and a new range of driver assistance, comfort and safety features. The 2014 Discovery comes with a standard ZF 8HP transmission, and in some markets can be supplied with a one-speed transfer case (replacing the two speed transfer case). 2014 also marks the first use of a supercharged six cylinder engine, replacing the previous V6 and V8 offerings.

In a January 2011 comparison test by &quot;Car and Driver&quot;, the Land Rover LR4 came in fourth place out of five cars behind the Audi Q7, BMW X5, and Acura MDX. However, it has always won the &quot;Auto Express&quot; categories of Best Large SUV and Best Towcar since it was launched in 2009.

To celebrate 25 years of the Land Rover Discovery, a special edition of 1800 (?) vehicles was produced in 2014 marked as the XXV, and featured a number of unique details including light grey (Cirrus) XXV-embossed Windsor leather seats, special grill sets, and almost every extra and expansion pack available. A number of these were exported in silver grey and the darker causeway grey for UK markets.

A major milestone in Land Rover Discovery&#x27;s history came when the one millionth example built rolled off the Solihull production line in March 2012. This vehicle, along with two similar examples, was driven from Solihull to Beijing, China in a replication of a 1950s expedition. During this expedition, G459 WAC, a pre-production Discovery 1 (which was subsequently converted into an amphibious vehicle) joined in the celebrations when the expedition visited Lake Geneva. The expedition concluded with the actual Millionth Discovery appearing at the Beijing Motor Show. This vehicle subsequently returned to go on permanent exhibition at the British Motor Industry Heritage Trust centre at Gaydon, Warwickshire, England.

== Fifth generation Discovery (L462; 2017–present) ==
The third-generation Discovery was unveiled in the grounds of Packington Hall near Meriden, UK on 28 September 2016, the eve of the 2016 Paris Motor Show, and went on sale in the UK in February 2017. Built on a platform shared with the Range Rover and Range Rover Sport, the current Discovery leaves behind many of the design traditions of former generations for a more modern, though less overtly practical, design. This model also marks the return of the Discovery marque in the U.S. market, replacing the LR moniker of the previous generation models. There are five-seat, seven-seat, and commercial van versions in the UK, Ireland and other European markets. In November 2020, a facelift for the model was launched, which debuted as a 2021 model.

This is the first Discovery that will be manufactured outside the UK, with production being moved to Slovakia in 2019.

A Discovery 3.0 TD6 achieved an AIR Index emission rating of &quot;A&quot; (A=Best, E=Worst) when independently tested in 2019.

The SVX version was debuted at the 2017 Frankfurt Motor Show; the car was to be on sale in 2019 but the project was cancelled.

=== Design ===
The design of the fifth generation Discovery was previewed by the Discovery Vision Concept at the 2014 New York Auto Show. In profile, the exterior design is also very similar to the small Discovery Sport model. In contrast to previous Discovery models, the third-generation has a much more rounded shape, eschewing the traditional angular design. The tail lights have changed from a vertical orientation to horizontal, and the third-row side glass no longer blends into the roof glass. The tailgate is no longer horizontally split and has been replaced with a conventional top hinged tailgate made from composite, but retaining the asymmetrically mounted license plate as a design cue from previous generations of the Discovery. The roof is still stepped over the third row, though it is now largely cosmetic in comparison to the previous models and the roof now has a strong taper to the back. The interior closely follows that from other contemporary Land Rover models, while continuing the 3-row tradition of the Discovery.

=== Mechanical ===
The new Discovery 5 incorporates several changes over its predecessors. For the first time, the Discovery is based on Land Rover&#x27;s aluminium architecture, first introduced on the Range Rover (L405). The use of aluminium chassis and body panels gives a weight loss of up to over its predecessor. This weight loss combined with a new aerodynamic design, a 17 per cent lower , achieves a fuel efficiency improvement over previous Discovery generations. The new Discovery is offered with a combination of V6 petrol and diesel engines. All Fifth generation Discoverys are equipped with a standard 8 speed automatic transmission. An available option package adds a two speed transfer case (low range gearbox) and the option of an actively locking rear differential. Coil springs are now standard on base trim models, while air suspension is still offered as an option.

Two permanent 4x4 systems are offered. The standard single-speed transfer case utilizes a Torsen limited-slip center differential. A basic distribution of 42% front and 58% rear is maintained by the center differential when the vehicle is travelling in a straight line. Upon loss of traction on one of the axles, the differential has a locking range of between 65/35 and 20/80 front-to-rear. Traction control takes over to maintain propulsion when the locking range of the differential is exceeded. A two-speed transfer case is optional. This transfer case uses a bevel-gear center differential to distribute the torque 50/50 between the front and rear axles. There is also a multi-disc clutch to limit slip between the axles, so the front and rear axles can be locked together. The center differential is lockable using the terrain response menu.
100% of engine power can be diverted to either axle without the need for intervention by traction control. A locking rear differential is also available.

Land Rover also introduced Terrain Response 2 on the Discovery 5. Similarly to the first generation of Terrain Response, Terrain Response 2 constantly monitors wheel slip, wheel speed, angle of approach or departure, and the suspension&#x27;s compression or rebound to adjust the anti-lock braking system, throttle response, differentials and traction control systems. The driver can select modes for snow, grass, gravel, mud ruts, sand, or rock crawling by turning a dial on the centre console. Terrain Response 2 also introduces a new &#x27;Auto&#x27; mode that allows the vehicles computer to select the most appropriate mode on its own.

The Discovery 5 is the first Discovery to be built on a unibody chassis, unlike its predecessors which were built body on frame. This allows the vehicle to have higher torsional rigidity with less weight. The latest generation has a higher wading depth (up to ), improved ground clearance and a more comfortable ride while traversing adverse terrain.
A mid-term update with a refreshed interior and new engine range was launched in 2021. Larger infotainment screens and revisions to the layout of the Commercial variant including more underfloor storage were the main highlights.

== Derivatives and specialist versions ==

Supacat, part of SC Group, offer two vehicles based on a modified Discovery 4 platforms. The Specialist Utility Vehicle 600 (SUV 600) is a production standard Land Rover Discovery 4 that is converted to 6x6 or 6x4 configuration for use in the emergency services and wider utility sectors. The Light Reconnaissance Vehicle 400 (LRV 400) is an open lightweight 4x4 vehicle of the Land Rover Defender class. The LRV 400 was developed based on a combination of market research and customer feedback from the 2011-unveiling of a proof-of-concept closed cab variant. Development of the LRV 400 continues, the latest Mk2 shown publicly for the first time at DSEI 2015 (15–18 September). The most significant design change for the Mk2 is a switch of the automotive platform to the Land Rover Discovery 4 rather than the off-road racer platform previously offered.

Land Rover offered an armoured version of the Discovery 4, the Sentinel. Protected to Level B6 (defined in accordance with European Standard EN1063 BR6 (glazing) and EN1522 and certified by QinetiQ), according to Jaguar Land Rover, the Discovery 4 Sentinel is almost indistinguishable from the non-armoured Discovery 4. As a factory supplied product, the vehicle comes with a Land Rover three-year or warranty, the support of Land Rover&#x27;s worldwide dealer network and a range of additional after sales packages. The UK Government ministers are often seen ferried around in Discovery 4 Sentinels.

A great number of Land Rover Discovery II and IV were bought and used by Italian Police and Carabinieri. The vehicles were configured with reinforced iron grating on mirrors and windshields, fire-extinguishing automatic system and run-flat tyres, for crowd and riot control operations.

== The 30th Anniversary ==

2019 saw the 30th Anniversary of the launch of the Land Rover Discovery. A special edition model was released. Celebratory events took place across the world. The new JLR plant in Slovakia had the capacity to produce up to 300,000 Discovery units per year. In Ireland, the Discovery range, including the Commercial, was fully aligned with that of the UK.

== Worldwide sales ==

As of 1 January 2017, some 1,200,000 Discovery models had been sold in total since launch in 1989.

Total sales are for 2009 and onward, excluding sales prior to that year.

<text>The Little Miami Scenic Trail is the fourth longest paved trail in the United States, running through five southwestern counties in the state of Ohio. The multi-use rail trail sees heavy recreational use by hikers and bicyclists, as well as the occasional horseback rider. Over 700,000 people made use of the trail in 2014.

Most of the trail runs along the banks of the Little Miami River, in a dedicated, car-free corridor known as Little Miami State Park. This unusually linear state park passes through four counties, with a right-of-way running about long and averaging in width for a total of about . Elsewhere, the corridor ranges from in width.

The Little Miami Scenic Trail is signposted as State Bike Route 1 south of Xenia and State Bike Route 3 throughout. It is the backbone of a nearly continuous network of paved multi-use trails, centered on the Miami Valley area, that stretches and connects the Cincinnati, Dayton, and Columbus metropolitan areas. The Little Miami trail is an incrementally growing section of the Buckeye Trail and North Country National Scenic Trail, while the trail south of Xenia also forms the southern leg of the Ohio to Erie Trail and part of U.S. Bicycle Route 21.

==History==
The largely wooded corridor was created along the right-of-way of the old Little Miami Railroad. The original railway bed is still visible beside the trail in various places along the trail route.

Together with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, the local governments of Xenia and Yellow Springs purchased land along the abandoned railroad from 1973 to 1983. In 1979, the land became an Ohio State Park. In 1979, ODNR studied developing the corridor as a scenic railroad up to long from Loveland to Corwin, as well as a bike trail and bridle trail. However, ODNR prioritized the trails, allowing the bankrupt Penn Central Transportation Company to salvage the rails and ties, which made building new tracks cost-prohibitive. The trail was strongly supported by residents and officials in Loveland, where a park was being developed around the Loveland Bike Trail, but was opposed by residents of Terrace Park, who were concerned about crime. The first of the trail from Morrow to Loveland was paved in late 1983 and officially opened on May 16, 1984. Two years later, the Ohio Department of Transportation received a grant from the Federal Highway Administration to complete the trail.

By December 20, 1991, the trail officially stretched from Spring Valley in Greene County to the Terrace Park village limit in Hamilton County, across the river from Milford. The trail was extended northward to Xenia later that year and to Springfield in 1998. In 2006, after a protracted, 26-year battle with Terrace Park residents, it was extended southward to Newtown.

In the late 2000s, state budget cuts caused portions of the trail to fall into disrepair, resulting in the temporary closure of some wooden bridges and rest areas. However, an organization called the Friends of the Little Miami State Park Group was founded late 2008 to focus attention and finances on critical portions to keep the trail open and make it safer. Most of the bridges within state park boundaries were paved or re-planked in 2009. In 2010, a failed parks levy prompted the Clark County Park District to indefinitely close its stretch of the trail, posting &quot;No Trespassing&quot; signs at park entrances. Because this stretch of trail was partially built with federal funds, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources attempted to force its reopening. The district reopened its parks in April 2011 with volunteer support.

Originally designated State Bike Route 1, the Little Miami Scenic Trail was renumbered in 2011 as State Bike Route 1 south of Xenia and State Bike Route 3 throughout. The concurrency from Newtown to Xenia is marked with &quot;⅓&quot; signs.

In the 2000s, the Adventure Cycling Association and OKI Regional Council proposed designating the Little Miami Scenic Trail as part of U.S. Bicycle Route 25. However, the Ohio Department of Transportation later planned to designate State Bike Route 1, including the Little Miami Scenic Trail south of Xenia, as USBR 21; USBR 25 would instead follow the Great Miami River Recreation Trail to the west. ODOT formally proposed a USBR 21 alignment to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials in spring 2021, which the committee approved. In 2022, a dedicated bridge opened in Cincinnati, spanning the Little Miami River and connecting the trail to other trails toward Downtown Cincinnati.

==Current route==

Xenia made a deal to be the official start of the trail for a donation of land, making the mile markers change from the previous start. For the first to Xenia, the Little Miami Scenic Trail is operated by the Clark County Park District and the National Trail Parks and Recreation District. From the Simon Kenton Trailhead in Springfield, the Little Miami trail runs southward parallel to U.S. Route 68 and continues to Yellow Springs. Near John Bryan State Park, the North Country Trail and Buckeye Trail enter from Dayton to the west. For the next to Spring Valley, the Little Miami trail is managed by Greene County. At Xenia Station, it meets the Creekside Trail, as well as the Prairie Grass Trail, on which the Ohio to Erie Trail and U.S. Bicycle Route 21 continue north to Columbus. A short segment of the Little Miami trail that connects the Creekside and Prairie Grass trails is also designated as U.S. Bike Route 50.

Little Miami State Park begins at Hedges Road in Spring Valley, quickly meets the banks of the Little Miami River, and follows U.S. 42 into Warren County. It passes through Corwin (near Waynesville), Caesar Creek State Park, and Oregonia, where the Buckeye Trail rejoins. At Fort Ancient, the trail runs under the imposing Jeremiah Morrow Bridge (Interstate 71). It then passes through the downtown districts of Morrow and South Lebanon to the former Middletown Junction, where the Lebanon Countryside Trail begins.

The Little Miami trail continues southward, opposite the river from Kings Mills and the rear of the expansive Kings Island park grounds. At this location the historic Peters Cartridge Company facility overlooks the bike trail. The trail passes under U.S. 22/State Route 3 at Fosters, across the river from the Landen Mounds. It continues by a few final cornfields before entering Clermont County and downtown Loveland, where it is known as the Loveland Bike Trail.

At Miamiville, the trail crosses to the western, Hamilton County side of the Little Miami River, as it meets State Route 126 (Glendale–Milford Road). The trail passes by Camp Dennison and its former southern terminus in Milford. A 2006 extension carries the Little Miami State Park along U.S. 50 (Wooster Pike) to Avoca Park in Terrace Park. From here, USBR 21, State Bicycle Route 1, and the Loveland section of the Buckeye Trail branch off, following local roads southwest to Cincinnati. A short Great Parks extension leads the Little Miami trail back across the river, beside local roads, to the Little Miami Golf Center in Newtown. The North Country Trail and the Williamsburg section of the Buckeye Trail continue southeast along heavily trafficked roads to Batavia and East Fork State Park.

The Little Miami Scenic Trail continues south another from the Little Miami Golf Center south to Clear Creek Park and along State Route 32 to Beechmont Avenue (State Route 125), across from Otto Armleder Memorial Park. Finally, the trail follows a dedicated bridge parallel to Beechmont Avenue over the Little Miami River to the Armleder Trail Connector in Armleder Park, the Lunken Loop around Lunken Field, and the Ohio River Trail westward toward downtown Cincinnati.

== Economic effects ==
Studies in 2008 and 2011 found that single-family residential properties increased in value with increased proximity to the Little Miami Scenic Trail.

<text>David Holmes Black (born April 9, 1946), is a Canadian media proprietor who founded and is the majority owner of Black Press Group Ltd. He serves as the company&#x27;s chairman, and previously served as its chief executive officer and president.

Black has served as president of the British Columbia and Yukon Community Newspaper Association, a director of the Canadian Community Newspaper Association, a governor of the Canadian Newspaper Association, and as a director of the American Press Institute.

In 2008, Black received the Margaret Hennigar Award for Exemplary Leadership from the Canadian Community Newspaper Association and was made an Honorary life time member. A year later Black was inducted the Business Laureates of British Columbia Hall of Fame in 2009.

As of 2022, Black Press and its subsidiaries own more than 170 titles throughout western Canada and the United States.

== Early life and education ==
Black was born in Vancouver, British Columbia to Alan and Adelaide Black. He graduated from the University of British Columbia with a degree in civil engineering. He then obtained his MBA at the University of Western Ontario. After school, he briefly worked for Crown Life Insurance in the early &#x27;70s.

In 1973, Black was hired to work as a junior business analyst in the acquisitions department at Torstar, which publishes the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; newspaper.

== Founding Black Press Media ==
Black started his newspaper company in 1975 when he purchased the &quot;Williams Lake Tribune&quot; of Williams Lake, British Columbia for $60,000. The paper had previously been owned since 1969 by his father Alan Black and the paper&#x27;s publisher Clive Stangoe.

Black operated the &quot;Tribune&quot; exclusively for four years until purchasing the husband-and-wife owned &quot;Ashcroft-Cache Creek Journal&quot; in nearby Ashcroft in 1979. Black continued to purchase other newspapers over time and soon formed newspaper clusters around Victoria and Vancouver.

In 1987, Black formed Sound Publishing after he purchased three newspapers on the Kitsap Peninsula in the United States. The subsidy has since managed all of his titles in Washington (state) and Alaska.

In 2001, Black purchased the &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot;. In 2010, Black purchased &quot;The Honolulu Advertiser&quot; and merged the two Hawaiian papers together to create the &quot;Honolulu Star-Advertiser&quot;. The paper is managed by a subsidy, Oahu Publications, along with all other publications Black owns in Hawaii.

As of 2022, News Media Canada reported Black Press publishes 106 editions across Canada with a combined circulation of 1,295,243. The number of titles include 70 in British Columbia, 11 in Alberta, two in Northwest Territories and one in Yukon.

== Oil refinery (2012-2016) ==
On August 17, 2012, Black announced he is putting forth a proposal to build a $13.2 billion oil refinery in Kitimat with his company, Kitimat Clean Ltd. The refinery would turn bitumen from the Alberta oil sands into solid pellets for shipment by train to the refinery north. At full capacity, 400,000 barrels of petroleum products would be produced a day and then be loaded onto tankers for shipment to markets globally.

Black used his personal funds to pay for feasibility and environmental studies for the project.

In March 2013, Black said he partnered with Oppenheimer Investments Group, a Switzerland-based firm, to raise the funds to proceed. At that time the original price tag of the refinery itself had risen to $16 billion due to switching to new technologies to reduce greenhouse gases. Other factors raised the total cost for the Kitimat Clean Refinery Project to $22 billion.

In April 2013, Black said the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China had agreed to become an investor and financial advisor for the project.

In 2016, Black submitted a 129 page project description to federal and provincial regulators for the environmental assessment process. On October 2, 2016, the federal environmental assessment of the project was suspended at the request of the proponent.

== Personal life ==

Black resides in Victoria, British Columbia. In 1970, Black married Annabeth Cote. The two first met while they were students at the University of British Columbia. The couple had four children together: twin sons Alan and Fraser, and daughters Morgan and Catherine. As of 2012, Black has nine grandchildren. His wife Annabeth died of pancreatic cancer on August 23, 2006. Black is a member of the Royal Vancouver Yacht Club and owns a boat called the Esperanza. Sometime in the &#x27;90s, he took a seven month break to sail 77-foot ketch across the Atlantic ocean.

Black is a supporter of the British Columbia Liberal Party and has made top-tier donations to the centre-right provincial political party. Between 2006 and 2011, Black Press contributed $5,430 to the BC Liberals.

=== Riffington Manor ===
Black lives at Riffington Manor, a prominent home in Uplands. The property along Beach Drive was built in 1913 for Scottish-born businessman Andrew Wright, one of the principal investors in the Uplands development. The stone for the mansion came from Haddington Island. The two-story house&#x27;s notable features include 10 fireplaces and an octagonal entrance hall that is rose-windowed at its dome and galleried at the upper level. Four bedrooms, each with a full bathroom and dressing room, occupy the entire upper floor. A reporter for the &quot;Times Colonist i&quot;n 2016 called the property &quot;one of Victoria&#x27;s most famous and historic waterfront estates.&quot;

Black has rented out the property for use as a film location, with all collected fees donated to the Victoria Hospice Society in his wife&#x27;s honor. In 2017, the house was used as a location in the fourth film in the Gourmet Detective series. In 2018, the house was a film location for the Hallmark Channel original film &quot;Once upon a Prince.&quot;

=== University of Victoria ===
Black is a long-time supporter of the University of Victoria. He served as the first board chair of the Peter B. Gustavson School of Business from 1991 to 1996. Since 2008, the annual Black Press Business Scholarship has awarded $5,000 to up to 37 students from across British Columbia entering the University of Victoria&#x27;s Bachelor of Commerce program.

UVic&#x27;s business school named Black &quot;Distinguished Entrepreneur of the Year&quot; in 2007. The university also awarded Black an honorary degree in 2014.

In 2019, the University of Victoria honored Black by naming the Black Ink Classroom in the David Strong Building lecture hall in his honor.

<doc id="884076" wikidata="Q14168910" url="?curid=884076" title="La Soirée du hockey">
<text>Radio-Canada has aired National Hockey League (NHL) broadcasts, usually Montreal Canadiens&#x27;, under the La Soirée du hockey (literally translated to &quot;The Night of Hockey&quot;) brand; which was the French language equivalent of the English Canadian CBC&#x27;s NHL broadcasts &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;. Similar to its English language counterpart, the show used &quot;The Hockey Theme&quot; as its theme song. The show ran from 1952 to 2004.

==Games covered==
&quot;La Soirée du hockey&quot; most frequently featured Montreal Canadiens games on Saturday evenings, usually in parallel with English-language broadcasts on CBC. In later years, CBC would drop some of its split-national telecasts in the 7 p.m. ET window, resulting in a single national telecast at that time (most of the time featuring the Toronto Maple Leafs), while Radio-Canada continued to feature the Canadiens. The broadcast featured Quebec Nordiques and Ottawa Senators games occasionally during the regular season on rare occasions where the Canadiens were idle on Saturday night.

During the playoffs, &quot;SDH&quot; featured all games involving the Montreal Canadiens. After they were eliminated from further contention (or if they did not make the playoffs that season), the program usually featured series of interest to French Canadians, all the way to the Stanley Cup Finals.

==Collaboration with Réseau des sports==
Beginning with the 2002–03 season, RDS secured exclusive French language rights to the NHL. The deal, reached with the Canadiens and not directly with the league, was meant to ensure a consistent home for all Canadiens games; as a general-interest network, Radio-Canada cannot give up so much airtime to Canadiens games. The announcement drew the ire of, among others, then-Heritage Minister Sheila Copps, who suggested that the network would somehow be violating its conditions of licence by not airing &quot;La Soirée du hockey&quot;. In fact, there is no specific mention in the CBC&#x27;s licence from the CRTC (or any other legal document governing the CBC) that the CBC&#x27;s networks carry coverage of NHL games, nor that there be parity between the two networks&#x27; carriage of such games.

Radio-Canada soon reached an agreement to produce the Saturday night games, to remain branded &quot;La Soirée du hockey&quot;, to be simulcast on both SRC and RDS.

===&quot;Le Hockey du samedi soir&quot;===
For reasons that are unclear, the SRC production agreement was terminated after the 2004 playoffs. Instead, RDS began to produce its own Saturday night broadcasts, titled &quot;Le Hockey du samedi soir&quot;. These were simulcast on SRC—but only outside Quebec, where RDS has limited distribution—for two further seasons through 2006. At that point, French-language rights to NHL hockey became fully exclusive to RDS.

==Present day==
The national French-language NHL package, including all Saturday broadcasts, moved to TVA Sports (under sub-licence from Rogers Communications) in 2014. While Rogers has licensed the rights to the &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; name from the CBC for its Saturday broadcasts (some of have continued to air on CBC), there has been no indication that the rights to the &quot;La Soirée du hockey&quot; branding are included in that deal. Instead, TVA Sports has branded its Saturday telecasts as &quot;La super soirée LNH&quot; (&quot;NHL Super Evening&quot;) and, unlike its English language counterpart, has not offered broadcasts to Radio-Canada.

<doc id="884077" wikidata="Q1130052" url="?curid=884077" title="Land Rover Freelander">
<text>The Land Rover Freelander is a series of four-wheel-drive vehicles that was manufactured and marketed by Land Rover from 1997 to 2015. The second generation was sold from 2007 to 2015 in North America and the Middle East as the LR2 and in Europe as the Freelander 2. The Freelander was sold in both two-wheel and four-wheel drive versions. The name &#x27;Freelander&#x27; is derived from the combination of &#x27;Freedom&#x27; and &#x27;Lander&#x27;. 

After having built exclusively body-on-frame 4WD vehicles for half a century, the first generation Freelander was the brand&#x27;s first model to use monocoque (unibody) structures, and was offered in three- and five-door body options, including a semi soft-top. The second generation (2007–2015) dropped all two-door options, leaving only a five-door estate car-like body, and – after 62 years – became the brand&#x27;s first ever to offer a two-wheel drive option (as of 2010).

After a five-year hiatus, the two-door Freelanders were succeeded by the three-door versions of the Range Rover Evoque in 2011, and the five-door generation 2 was replaced by the Discovery Sport in 2015, the nameplate spanning two generations and less than eighteen years.


==Marque==

In 2024 Jaguar Land Rover and Chery announced they would build Freelander-branded Electric Vehicles in China.

== First generation (L314; 1997–2006) ==


===Development===
In 1988, British Aerospace acquired the Rover Group for £150 million, which allowed resources across Rover brands and Land Rover to be pooled differently, and the idea of developing a smaller Land Rover became more attainable than previously.

When the board approved the Pathfinder project, it was codenamed CB40 (after Canley Building 40, where the concept was initially developed). Remarkably, the new, compact Land Rover had become almost as long as the original Range Rover, that had been phased out just the year before, and even sported an inch (2.5 cm) &quot;longer&quot; wheelbase. While being Land Rover&#x27;s first monocoque design, it still featured a substantial subframe with welded, box section rails, giving it extra strength and rigidity.

===Production===
When BMW acquired Rover Group, they terminated the agreement, and instead funded production facilities at Solihull, making use of the Rover SD1 assembly hall which had been inactive in the early 1980s, when Rover car production was moved to Cowley.

In 2002, Land Rover SA was awarded export contracts to supply 1,000 left-hand drive Defenders to Angola and more than 3,000 right-hand drive Freelanders and Defenders to Australia. This followed the move by the manufacturer to build Freelanders for local distribution at the Ford Motor Company of Southern Africa&#x27;s Q1, ISO 9001, and ISO 14001 certified assembly plant in Silverton, Pretoria. Paul Melhuish, then Land Rover SA’s sales and marketing director, said: &quot; “From November this year we will commence shipment of approximately 3,000 Freelanders and 216 Defenders to Australia. The Freelander shipments will comprise both TD4 and KV6 models, while the Defender 110 CSW and the Defender 130 double cab models will make up the majority of the Defender sales figures.&quot;

===Popularity===
The Mk1 Land Rover Freelander was an instant hit and went on to become the biggest-selling four-wheel-drive model in Europe, with over 540,000 units sold over its nine-year lifespan. The Freelander became Europe&#x27;s best-selling 4WD vehicle for five consecutive years after launch in 1997; and in 2016 Land Rover embraced it as its 8th &#x27;Heritage vehicle&#x27;.

=== Model variations ===
There were a variety of models, based around five-door estate and three-door softback (semi-convertible), hardback, and commercial (van-like) versions. In 2004, Land Rover introduced an improved and upgraded version of the Mark I; changes included a new interior and major external revisions, including a new face and rear.

The three-door model was available in E, S, ES, Sport and Sport Premium trim and the five-door model in available in E, S, ES, HSE, Sport and Sport Premium trim.

=== Freelander in North America ===
The Freelander was launched in the US and Canadian markets in 2001 for the 2002 model year, and it was only available with the 2.5L Rover KV6 engine and the 5-speed Jatco JF506E automatic transmission. The five-door model was initially available in S, SE, and HSE trims, and the three-door SE3 was introduced in 2003. With a starting price of under $25,000 in the US, it was more than $8,000 cheaper than the Discovery II, and was sold as a premium competitor to off-road SUVs such as the Toyota RAV4, the Honda CR-V, the Jeep Liberty and the Nissan Xterra. Although it initially sold well, the NA-spec Freelander soon encountered several notable reliability issues.

One problem was with the KV6 engine, which had issues with the cast-iron cylinder liners slipping out of place in the engine block, which would damage the engine to the point where it was irreparable. The engine thermostat and coolant expansion tank also failed under warranty, which would cause the engine to overheat, damage the head gaskets, and warp the engine block and cylinder heads.

The transmission also had several problems, most often solenoid failure on the transmission valve body. Although replacing the solenoids on the transmission is a relatively inexpensive job, most Land Rover dealers simply replaced the entire transmission. As a result, solenoid failure would happen again, and mechanics would often misdiagnose the problem as a failed transmission. 

Freelander owners launched a class-action lawsuit, alleging that Land Rover knowingly sold a defective product and that they failed to adhere to the vehicle&#x27;s warranty coverage during repairs. Land Rover eventually settled with owners by compensating owners for repairs that the owner paid for out-of-pocket, or repurchasing vehicles under the Lemon law. 

Although 15,021 units were sold in 2002, making it the second-best selling Land Rover in the US after the Discovery II, sales plummeted to 6,618 sold in 2003, 5,430 in 2004, and 2,141 in 2005. Today, the Freelander is a rare sight on US roads.

After MG Rover Group went into administration and the Powertrain Ltd division could no longer produce KV6 engines, Land Rover discontinued the Freelander in the US after the 2005 model year. Land Rover left the compact SUV segment in the US until the Freelander 2, sold in the US as the LR2, was introduced for the 2008 model year.

=== Engines ===
Engine choices included:
* 1.8-litre I4 Rover K-series petrol (1997–2006), badged as &#x27;1.8i&#x27;, &#x27;Xi&#x27; or &#x27;XEi&#x27; (Not sold in North America)
* 2.0-litre I4 Rover L-series diesel (1997–2000), badged as &#x27;Di&#x27;, &#x27;XDi&#x27; or &#x27;XEDi&#x27;
* 2.0-litre I4 BMW M47 diesel (2001–2006), badged as &#x27;Td4&#x27;
* 2.5-litre V6 Rover KV6 Engine petrol (2001–2006), badged as &#x27;V6&#x27;

Manual gearboxes dominated the early models, but automatic Tiptronic-style gearboxes (Jatco JF506E) became increasingly popular and were standard on the V6. The Automatic Tiptronic gearbox was also available as an option on the Td4.

=== Marketing ===
The first generation Freelander was marketed as a premium compact 4x4, and used in the 1998 Camel Trophy and participated in Land Rover&#x27;s G4 Challenge. The vehicle represented a compromise because it did not have a low-range gear selection, nor a locking differential, as found on larger Land Rover models. This meant that in comparison to other Land Rovers, off-road performance was not as good. In comparison to similar models produced by other manufacturers in the same period of time like the Honda CRV or the Toyota RAV4, however, the first generation Freelander was far more competent off-road.

It had more than sixteen patented features, including the IRD or Intermediate Reduction Drive, which acted as a front differential and fixed ratio transfer; the VCU or viscous-coupling, which reacts to the differing rotational speed of the prop shafts, allowing varying torque across itself; and the Hill Descent Control system, which was then implemented in the rest of the Land Rover range and even in the first generation BMW X5 (BMW was the parent company of Rover Group at the time of introduction of this model).

This first generation also used a Traction Control system and a special version of ABS produced by Wabco, modified to assist driving in off-road situations. Lack of the MG Rover K18 and KV6 engines after the end of the MG Rover production led Land Rover to discontinue the model on 31 August 2005 in the U.S. and Canada.

===Safety===
==Freelander 2 (L359; 2006–2015) ==
The second generation was internally designated L359; debuted at the 2006 British International Motor Show and was marketed as the Freelander 2, retaining the &quot;Freelander&quot; name in Europe and marketed as the &quot;LR2&quot; in North America and the Middle East – mirroring the marketing of the new third generation Land Rover Discovery as LR3. A presentation at the Kensington Roof Gardens was held for journalists featuring celebrity tennis player Maria Sharapova. Production ended on 7 October 2014.


The second generation Freelander is based on the Ford EUCD platform, which itself is based on the Ford C1 platform. The Ford EUCD platform will be used by more upcoming vehicles from Volvo. The engine range is all-new for Freelander, featuring transversely-mounted 3.2-litre straight-six engine of the Volvo SI6 series, which debuted in the new Volvo S80, as well as the 2.2-litre DW12 common rail turbodiesel engine from PSA Peugeot Citroën.

Unlike previous Land Rovers, the second generation Freelander is manufactured in the Halewood Body &amp; Assembly facility, near Liverpool, and was until 2009 manufactured alongside the Jaguar X-Type, with which it shared a modified version of Ford&#x27;s front wheel drive platform. The new Freelander features higher ground clearance and off-road capabilities that are closer to other Land Rover models.
The second generation has improved quality interior with more safety features as standard. The Freelander 2 features a modified version of the Terrain Response off-road driving system as fitted to the Discovery 3 and the Range Rover. The 4WD system was developed in conjunction with Haldex and was called Third generation coupling. Vehicles from the 2009 model year are fitted with a modified design of the active on-demand coupling, known as Haldex&#x27;s Fourth generation.

The new Freelander was first marketed in the U.S. in 2007 as the LR2. The 2008 version is called the LR2 HSE. The limited run HST had added side trim, front valance, and 19-inch wheels. A Volvo 3.2-litre inline six-cylinder engine producing is standard, with a six-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. In the United Kingdom, the standard engine is the PSA 2.2-litre turbo diesel. The eD4 version of the engine produces , the TD4 comes with , and the SD4 comes with .

Interior appointments include an Alpine 440-watt 14-speaker surround sound audio and a 7-inch touch navigation screen options, while the newer models can be equipped with an Meridian audio system, which comes with a surround sound 17-speaker system with Trifield technology, producing 825 watts.

The Meridian system is also equipped with subwoofers and Audyssey MultEQ audio tuning system. Also a 5-inch colour display screen is standard even at the newer entry-level models. An optional cold climate package includes heated front windscreen, heated front seats with two heating levels and heated windscreen washers. The optional lighting package includes bi-xenon headlights, adaptive front-lighting, memory for the driver seat, as well as exterior mirrors and approach and puddle lamps.

===Freelander 2 TD4_e===
The Freelander TD4_e features stop-start technology to improve fuel economy and reduce carbon emissions. The system cuts out the engine when the vehicle is stationary, neutral is selected and the clutch engaged; the engine restarts when the clutch pedal is depressed.

The system includes a heavy-duty starter motor that also acts as a generator to recover energy through regenerative braking that is then stored in capacitors to restart the engine reducing stress on the vehicle&#x27;s battery and electrical system. The stop-start system became available in spring 2009 on Freelander 2 TD4 models.

===Freelander 2 eD4===
For the first time in Land Rover&#x27;s history, from the 2011 model year, a purely two-wheel drive version, badged eD4, was available. This model also dropped the Terrain Response and Hill Descent Control systems. Omitting four-wheel drive saved of weight, and the eD4 achieved a combined economy figure of , along with emissions of 158 g/km .

After introduction of the Range Rover Evoque in 2011, this model competed with the Freelander 2, especially with the eD4, as the Evoque was both cheaper to purchase, more efficient, more premium, and combined this with standard four-wheel drive.

For the 2013 model year, the Freelander got a revised look with a different grille, and new interior trim.

<text>The Land Rover Defender (initially introduced as the Land Rover One Ten, and in 1984 joined by the Land Rover Ninety, plus the new, extra-length Land Rover One Two Seven in 1985) is a series of British off-road cars and pickup trucks. They consistently have four-wheel drive, and were developed in the 1980s from the original Land Rover series which was launched at the Amsterdam Motor Show in April 1948. Following the 1989 introduction of the Land Rover Discovery, the term &#x27;Land Rover&#x27; became the name of a broader marque, and no longer worked as the name of a specific model; thus in 1990 Land Rover renamed them as Defender 90 and Defender 110 and Defender 130 respectively.

The vehicle, a British equivalent of the Second World War derived (Willys) Jeep, gained a worldwide reputation for ruggedness and versatility. Using a steel ladder chassis and an aluminium alloy bodywork, the Land Rover originally used detuned versions of Rover engines.

Though the Defender was not a new generation design, it incorporated significant changes, compared to the series Land Rovers, such as adopting coil springs front and rear. Coil springs offered both better ride quality and improved axle articulation. The addition of a centre differential to the transfer case gave the Defender permanent four-wheel-drive capability. Both changes were derived from the original Range Rover, and the interiors were also modernised. Whilst the engines were carried over from the Series III, a new series of modern and more powerful engines was progressively introduced. 

Even when ignoring the series Land Rovers and perhaps ongoing licence products, the 90/110 and Defender models&#x27; 33-year production run were ranked as the sixteenth longest single-generation car in history in 2020.

In 2020, Jaguar Land Rover introduced an all new generation of Land Rover Defender Land Rover Defender (L663) switching from body on chassis to integrated bodywork and from live, rigid axles to all around independent suspension.

==History==
After a continuous run of 67 years production finally ended on 29 January 2016, after a total of just over two million Land Rover Series and Defender models had been built. The two millionth unit was assembled with the help of a special team in May 2015, and charitably auctioned for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent (IFRC) Societies later that year. The last Land Rover Defender, rolled off the production line, with the number plate H166 HUE, a reference to the first ever pre-production Land Rover, registration &#x27;HUE 166&#x27;. This was the 2,016,933rd Defender to be produced.

A special edition Defender Works V8, with , was announced in January 2018. Until 2020, the Defender was last sold in North America in 1997, after which safety regulations prohibited its sale.

An all-new 2020 Land Rover Defender made its global debut in September 2019 and was initially offered with two wheelbase options. This new model, which shares no components or technology with its predecessor, has an aluminium monocoque body.

==Name and badge distinctions==
The coil-sprung Land Rover was introduced in 1983 as &quot;Land Rover One Ten&quot;, and in 1984 the &quot;Land Rover Ninety&quot; was added – the numbers representing the respective wheelbases in inches (despite the Ninety was 92.9-inches.) The number was spelled in full in advertising and in handbooks and manuals, and the vehicles also carried badges above the radiator grille which read &quot;Land Rover 90&quot; or &quot;Land Rover 110&quot;, with the number rendered numerically. The Ninety and One Ten replaced the earlier Land Rover Series, and at the time of launch, the only other Land Rover model in production was the Range Rover.

In 1989, a third model was brought out by Land Rover to be produced in parallel with the other two: the Land Rover Discovery. To avoid possible confusion, the 1991 model year Ninety and the One Ten were renamed the &quot;Defender 90&quot; and &quot;Defender 110&quot;. These carried front badges that said &quot;Defender&quot;, with a badge on the rear of the vehicle saying &quot;Defender 90&quot; or &quot;Defender 110&quot;. The L316 model, from 2007–2016, still featured the space above the radiator for the badge but was blank. Instead it had &quot;Land Rover&quot; spelled across the leading edge of the bonnet in raised individual letters, in keeping with the Discovery and Freelander. At the rear was a new style of &#x27;&quot;Defender&quot; badge with an underlining &quot;swoosh&quot;. On these last models there are no badges defining the wheelbase model of the vehicle.

The wheelbase Land Rover One Two Seven, available from 1985, was always marketed with the name rendered numerically. Following the adoption of the Defender name, it became the &quot;Defender 130&quot;, although the wheelbase remained unchanged.

The North American Specification (NAS) Defender 110 sold for the 1993 model year carried a badge above the radiator grille which read &quot;Defender&quot;, whereas the NAS Defender 90 sold for the 1994 to 1997 model years had &quot;Land Rover&quot; spelled across the top of the radiator grille in individual letter decals. NAS Defenders also carried a cast plaque on the rear tub in the original style of the Series estate cars with &quot;Defender 110&quot; or &quot;Defender 90&quot; below the Land Rover lozenge and the vehicle&#x27;s unique limited edition production run number.

==Land Rover Ninety and One Ten==

Production of the model now known as the Defender began in 1983 as the Land Rover One Ten, a name which reflected the 110-inch (2,800mm) length of the wheelbase. The Land Rover Ninety, with wheelbase, and Land Rover 127, with wheelbase, soon followed. All measurements were metric, but communicated in the closest imperial terms familiar to the predecessor Series 3 88” and 109” models. 

Superficially, there is little to distinguish the post-1983 vehicles from the Series III Land Rover. A full-length bonnet, revised grille, plus the fitting of wheel arch extensions to cover wider-track axles are the most noticeable changes. Initially the conservative engineering department insisted that the One Ten was also available with a part-time 4WD system familiar to derivatives produced since 1949. However, the part-time system failed to sell and was quickly dropped from the options list by 1984. While the engines and other body panels carried over from the Series III, mechanically the Ninety and One Ten were modernised, including:

* Coil springs, offering a more compliant ride and improved axle articulation
* A permanent four-wheel-drive system derived from the Range Rover, featuring a two-speed transfer gearbox with a lockable centre differential
* A modernised interior
* A taller one-piece windscreen
* Uprated engines: One diesel and two petrol

The One Ten was launched in 1983, and the Ninety followed in 1984. From 1984, wind-up windows were fitted (Initial 110s had sliding panels), and a , diesel engine was introduced. This was based on the earlier engine, but had a more modern fuel-injection system as well as increased capacity. A low compression version of the V8 Range Rover engine improved performance. It was initially available in the 110 with a Range Rover LT95 four-speed transmission with integral transfer case and vacuum operated differential lock, then later in conjunction with a high strength &quot;Santana&quot; five-speed transmission.

===L315 model===
In recognition of a number of changes the Defender is designated as L315 Land Rover from model year 1987 to 2006. This period saw Land Rover market the utility Land Rover as a private recreational vehicle. While the basic pick-up, 4x4 and van versions were still working vehicles, the County 4x4s were sold as multi-purpose family vehicles, featuring improved interior trim and more comfortable seats. This change was reflected in Land Rover starting what had long been common practice in the car industry: detail changes and improvements to the County model from year to year in order to attract new buyers and to encourage existing owners to trade in for a new vehicle. These changes included different exterior styling graphics and colour options, and the introduction of new options such as radio-cassette players, air-conditioning, Rostyle wheels, headlamp wash and wipe systems, as well as accessories such as surfboard carriers and bike racks. 

===The One Two Seven===
From 1983, Land Rover introduced a third wheelbase to its utility line-up, a wheelbase vehicle designed to accommodate larger, heavier loads than the One Ten. Called the &quot;Land Rover One Two Seven&quot;, it was designed specifically with use by utility companies in mind, as well as military usage. In its standard form, it is a four-door six-seater consisting of the front half of a One Ten 4x4, and the rear of a One Ten high-capacity pick up (HCPU). Logic was that this allowed a workcrew and their equipment to be carried in one vehicle at the same time. The One Two Seven could carry up to a payload, compared to the payload of the One Ten and the of the Ninety.

Land Rover One Two Sevens were built on a special production line, and all started life as One Ten 4x4 chassis (the model was initially marketed as the One Ten crew cab, before the more logical One Two Seven name was adopted). These were then cut in two and the of extra chassis length welded on before the two original halves were reunited. These models did not receive their own dedicated badging like the other two models: instead they used the same metal grille badges as used on the Series III 109 V8 models, that simply said &quot;Land-Rover&quot;.
Although the standard body-style was popular, the One Two Seven was a common basis for conversion to specialist uses, such as mobile workshops, ambulances, fire engines and flatbed transports. In South Africa, the Land Rover assembly plant offered a One Two Seven 4x4 with seating for 15. Land Rover also offered the One Two Seven as a bare chassis, with just front bodywork and bulkhead, for easy conversion.
Initially held back by the low power of the Land Rover engines (other than the thirsty petrol V8 engine), the One Two Seven benefited from the improvements to the line-up, and by 1990 was only available with the two highest power engines, the 3.5-litre V8 petrol, and the 2.5-litre turbo diesel .

===Engine development===
The original One Ten of 1983 was available with the same engine line-up as the Series III vehicles it replaced, namely petrol and diesel engines, and a V8 petrol unit. In 1981, the 2.25 L engines were upgraded from three- to five-crankshaft bearings in preparation for the planned increases in capacity and power. The five bearing version was known as the 2.3-litre to differentiate it despite having the same displacement.

The 2.5-litre version of the diesel engine, displacing and producing , was introduced in both the One Ten and the newly arrived Ninety. This was a long-stroke version of the venerable 2.25-litre unit, fitted with updated fuel injection equipment and a revised cylinder head for quieter, smoother and more efficient running. A timing belt also replaced the older engine&#x27;s chain. Despite these improvements the engine was underpowered and unrefined in comparison with the competition.

In 1985 the petrol units were upgraded. An enlarged four-cylinder engine was introduced. This engine shared the same block and cooling system (as well as other ancillary components) as the diesel unit. Unlike the diesel engine, this new 2.5-litre petrol engine retained the chain-driven camshaft of its 2.25-litre predecessor. At the same time, the V8 was also made available in the Ninety: the first time a production short-wheelbase Land Rover had been given V8 power. The V8 on both models was now mated to an all-new five-speed LT85 manual gearbox.

The year 1986 saw improvements in engines to match the more advanced offerings by Japanese competitors. The &quot;Diesel Turbo&quot; engine was introduced in September, a lightly turbocharged version of the existing 2.5-litre diesel, with several changes to suit the higher power output, including a re-designed crankshaft, teflon-coated pistons and nimonic steel exhaust valves to cope with the higher internal temperatures. Similarly, an eight-bladed cooling fan was fitted, together with an oil cooler. The changes for the turbo diesel were kept as slight as possible, in the aim of making the car saleable in Land Rover&#x27;s traditional export markets across the globe.

The 2.5 diesel, 2.5 petrol and Turbo Diesel engines all shared the same block castings and other components such as valve-gear and cooling system parts, allowing them to be built on the same production line. The Turbo Diesel produced , a 13% increase over the naturally aspirated unit, and a 31.5% increase in torque to at 1,800 rpm. Externally, turbo diesel vehicles differed from other models only by having an air intake grille in the left-hand wing to supply cool air to the turbo. Early turbo-diesel engines gained a reputation for poor reliability, with major failures to the bottom-end and cracked pistons. A revised block and improved big end bearings were introduced in 1988, and a re-designed breather system in 1989. These largely solved the engine&#x27;s problems, but it remained (like many early turbo-diesels) prone to failure if maintenance was neglected.

At the same time that the Turbo Diesel was introduced, the V8 engine was upgraded. Power was increased to , and SU carburettors replaced the Zenith models used on earlier V8s.

===Sales turnaround===

The new vehicles with their more modern engines, transmissions, and interiors reversed the huge decline in sales that took place in the 1980s (a 21% fall in a single year, 1980–1981). This growth was mainly in the domestic UK market and Europe. African, Australian and Middle-Eastern sales failed to recover significantly – Land Rover had not been immune to the poor reputation caused by substandard build quality and unreliability which had afflicted the rest of British Leyland, of which Land Rover was still part. In these markets Japanese vehicles such as the Toyota Landcruiser and Nissan Patrol gradually took over what had been a lucrative export market for Land Rover for decades. Meanwhile, the company itself adopted more modern practices, such as using marketing campaigns to attract new buyers who would not previously have been expected to buy a Land Rover. The operation was streamlined, with most of the satellite factories in the West Midlands that built parts for the Land Rover being closed and production brought into the Solihull factory, which was expanded.

==Speciality vehicles==

To maximise sales in Europe, Land Rover set up the &quot;Special Vehicles Division&quot;, which handled conversions, adaptations and limited production volume versions. The bulk of the division&#x27;s work was the construction of stretched-wheelbase mobile workshops and crew carriers for British and European utility companies, often including six-wheel-drive conversions, but more unusual projects were undertaken, such as the construction of an amphibious Land Rover 90 used by the company as part of its sponsorship of Cowes Week from 1987 to 1990. 

The &quot;Special Projects Division&quot; also handled specialised military contracts, such as the building of a fleet of V8-powered Rapier missile launchers for the British Army. The Rapier system actually consisted of three Land Rovers: a One Two Seven which carried the launching and aiming equipment, and two One Tens which carried the crew and additional equipment.


==Defender==
The biggest change to the Land Rover came in late 1990, when it became the Land Rover Defender. This was because in 1989 the company had introduced the Discovery model, requiring the original Land Rover to acquire a name. The Discovery also had a new turbodiesel engine, the 200TDi. This was also loosely based on the existing 2.5-litre turbo unit, and was built on the same production line, but had a modern alloy cylinder head, improved turbocharging, intercooling and direct injection. It retained the block, crankshaft, main bearings, cambelt system, and other ancillaries as the Diesel Turbo. The breather system included an oil separator filter to remove oil from the air in the system, thus finally solving the Diesel Turbo&#x27;s main weakness of re-breathing its own sump oil. The 200Tdi, produced and of torque, which was nearly a 25% improvement on the engine it replaced (although as installed in the Defender the engine was de-tuned slightly from its original Discovery specification due to changes associated with the turbo position and exhaust routing).

This engine finally allowed the Defender to cruise comfortably at high speeds, as well as tow heavy loads speedily on hills while still being economical. In theory, it only replaced the older Diesel Turbo engine in the range, with the other four-cylinder engines (and the V8 petrol engine) still being available. However, the Tdi&#x27;s combination of performance and economy meant that it took the vast majority of sales. Exceptions were the British Army and some commercial operators, who continued to buy vehicles with the 2.5-litre naturally aspirated diesel engine (in the army&#x27;s case, this was because the Tdi was unable to be fitted with a 24-volt generator). Small numbers of V8-engined Defenders were sold to users in countries with low fuel costs or who required as much power as possible (such as in Defenders used as fire engines and ambulances).

Along with the 200Tdi engine, the One Two Seven&#x27;s name was changed to the &quot;Land Rover Defender 130&quot;. The wheelbase remained the same; the new figure was simply a rounding up. More importantly, 130s were no longer built from &quot;cut-and-shut&quot; 110s, but had dedicated chassis built from scratch. The chassis retained the same basic structure as the 90 and 110 models, but with a longer wheelbase.

1994 saw another development of the Tdi engine, the 300Tdi. Although the 200Tdi had been a big step forward, it had been essentially a reworking of the old turbocharged diesel to accept a direct injection system. In contrast the 300Tdi was virtually new, despite the same capacity, and both the Defender and the Discovery had engines in the same state of tune, , .

Throughout the 1990s the vehicle attempted to climb more and more upmarket, while remaining true to its working roots. This trend was epitomised by limited-edition vehicles, such as the SV90 in 1992 with roll-over protection cage, alloy wheels and metallic paint and the 50th anniversary 90 in 1998, equipped with automatic transmission, air conditioning and Range Rover 4.0-litre V8 engine. Despite these improvements, the Defender in the UK continued to be sold in the taxation class of a commercial vehicle and therefore attracted Value Added Tax (VAT) whenever resold on the secondhand market.

A new variant was the Defender 110 double cab, featuring a 4x4-style seating area, with an open pick up back. Although prototypes had been built in the Series days, it was not until the late 1990s that this vehicle finally reached production.

===BMW M52 engine===
Land Rover South Africa offered a unique Defender during the period the group was owned by BMW. Between 1997 and 2001, the Defender 90 and 110 were offered with a BMW petrol engine alongside the normal Tdi engine. The engine was the BMW M52 2793 cc, straight-six, 24-valve engine as found in the BMW 328i, 528i, 728i, and the Z3. Power and torque output for this engine was at 5,300 rpm and at 3,950 rpm. This option was offered due to a demand for a petrol-driven alternative to the diesel engine after production of the V8 Defender had ended. The vehicles were built at Rosslyn outside Pretoria. Total production for the 2.8i was 1395, which included 656 Defender 90s and 739 Defender 110s. This is an estimate based on sales figures from the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (NAAMSA). Early models were not speed-restricted, but later models were limited to . 

The development of the Defender 2.8i began in February 1996 as a joint project between Land Rover and BMW, following the recent unification of the two companies. Some of BMW&#x27;s top engineers including Frank Isenberg, head of BMW Driver Training and the F87 M2 project, were part of the development team. The project was initially top secret and in 2 to 3 weeks&#x27; time they had converted a Defender 110 that originally had a 3.5-litre V8 into the first 2.8i. To produce a 90 2.8i prototype a Defender 90 with a V8 chassis was required, but the local 3.5-litre version had ended production, so Land Rover UK sent a North American specification 1995 Defender 90 soft top model to South Africa which engineers turned into the first Defender 90 2.8i prototype. They nicknamed it &quot;Green Mamba&quot; due to its Coniston Green colour. To make the 2.8i Defenders ready for production, the prototypes were subjected to extensive testing. According to Land Rover South Africa, there were six prototype vehicles that were tested off-road and on-road for over 500,000 kms total. The new BMW M52 Defender performed better than the V8 Defender it replaced in nearly every test.

To adapt the BMW M52 engine to the Defender chassis, the engineers were able to utilize some of the parts from the recently developed BMW M51 diesel-powered Range Rover 2.5 DSE. They used the clutch housing, clutch, flywheel, and slave cylinder from that vehicle to connect the engine to the R380 gearbox, but they had to produce a new clutch housing adaptor (bell housing) for the petrol M52 engine in the Defender. The unique clutch housing adaptor was necessary because the petrol M52 engine is tilted 10 degrees compared to the diesel M51 engine and it needed to be longer to match the input shaft of the R380 gearbox borrowed from the 300Tdi Defender. Due to the large diameter gearbox input shaft, the standard BMW pilot bearing could not be fitted, so a unique pilot bushing made of Oilite bronze was developed. It had an inside diameter of 7/8-inch with an outside diameter of 32 mm. A mixture of non-metric and metric specifications are common on Land Rovers. Other unique parts that were developed for the 2.8i were the air intake ducts both before and after the Donaldson FPG RadialSeal™ air cleaner, engine mounts, radiator cowl, cooling hoses, fuel lines, clutch lines, air conditioning system, engine wiring, tachometer gauge, exhaust system, and a specially tuned Siemens MS41.0 DME with a Lucas 10AS alarm in place of the Drive Away Protection system (EWS) used on BMWs.&lt;ref name=&quot;LAND ROVER / MG ROVER Catalogue&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; To compensate for lower torque output in the low range of the power band compared to the V8 and diesel engines, engineers fitted the 2.8i with a 1.667:1 gear ratio LT230 transfer box. This allowed power to be more readily available and made the vehicle particularly well suited for traversing a wide range of difficult terrain such as sand dunes. The high gear ratio also helped the 2.8i sprint from 0–100 km/h in 9.3 seconds, making it the fastest production Defender ever made.

The exhaust system for both the 90 and 110 M52 Defender consists of two exhaust manifolds followed by two catalytic converters. There is not a version of the exhaust system without catalytic converters. The two pipes enter the rear silencer and a single pipe exits to the rear to complete the exhaust system. There are no oxygen sensors present.

There were some major changes made to the 2.8i for the 2000 model year. It received a variety of updates including new instrumentation with new gauges with improved illumination and switches, an updated chassis, and new electrical systems similar to the Td5. It also received an updated cooling system with an aluminium radiator to help solve overheating issues experienced with the older brass radiator, and an updated fuel system consisting of nylon fuel lines in favour of steel lines that have a tendency to rust, as well as a new fuel tank, pump, and filter with quick-connect fittings.

BMW South Africa created wiring diagrams for the Defender 2.8i. The document splits diagrams into two categories as Pre MY99 and MY99. Pre MY99 is for 1999 and older Defenders and MY99 is for 2000 and newer Defenders. 

===Td5 engine===
In 1998, the Defender was fitted with an all-new 2.5-litre, five-cylinder in-line turbodiesel engine, badged the Td5. The Tdi could not meet upcoming Euro III emissions regulations so the Td5 replaced the Tdi as the only available power unit. The engine used electronic control systems and produced at 4,850 rpm, more than the Tdi, with improved refinement. Traditionalists were critical of the electronic systems deployed throughout the vehicle, but concerns that these would fail when used in extreme conditions proved unfounded.

For the 2002 model year, further refinements were made to the Td5 engine to help it achieve ever-more stringent emission regulations. The &quot;XS&quot; 4x4 was introduced in 2002 as a top-specification level and the &quot;County&quot; package could be applied to every model in the line-up. XS models come with many &quot;luxury&quot; features, such as heated windscreen, heated seats, air conditioning, ABS and traction control and part-leather seats. At the same time, other detail improvements were made including a dash centre console, improved instrument illumination and the availability of front electric windows for the first time on a Defender. The design faults of the two-piece rear 4x4 door were finally eradicated with a one-piece door featuring a rubber weather sealing strip for the rear window.

===L316 model===

From spring 2007, a series of changes were made to the Defender, most of which were implemented to meet emissions and safety legislation. The biggest change was to the drivetrain. The Td5 engine was replaced by an engine from Ford&#x27;s DuraTorq line (AKA the Puma engine), built in their factory in Dagenham, making the Td5 the last Land Rover engine to be built in-house at Solihull. The engine chosen was from the ZSD family, being a version of the 2.4-litre four-cylinder unit also used in the highly successful Ford Transit. The engine&#x27;s lubrication and sealing system was adapted for use in wet, dusty conditions and to maintain lubrication at extreme angles in off-road use. The power level remained the same at , but with a lower power peak speed for towing and better acceleration. Torque output rose from to due to the fitting of a variable-geometry turbocharger. This produced a wider spread of torque than the Td5, from 1,500 rpm to 2,000 rpm. The engine was mated to a new six-speed gearbox. First gear is lower than the previous gearbox for better low-speed control, whilst the higher sixth gear is intended to reduce noise and fuel consumption at high speeds.

The other major changes were to the interior. The dashboard layout of the original 110 from 1983 (which was in turn very similar to that used on the Series III from 1971) was replaced with a full-width fascia and different instrumentation. Instruments came from the Discovery 3, and some of the centre panels come from the Ford Transit. Whilst some interior fittings from the British Leyland parts bin – some of which dated back to the 1970s – were finally dropped, the steering column switchgear (sourced from the Mk.1 Austin Metro) and the ignition switch (from the Morris Marina) were carried over from the previous interior. A new heater and ventilation system improved de-misting and heater performance.

Other interior changes were to the seating layout. Legislation from the European Union outlaws the inward-facing seats used in the rear of previous Land Rover 4x4s. The 2007 Defender replaced the four inward-facing seats with two forward-facing seats. This made the Defender 90 4x4 a four-seater vehicle (reduced from six or seven), and the Defender 110 4x4 a seven-seater (reduced from nine). This brought the Defender in line with its competitors which have generally used this layout for many years. A new bodystyle was introduced on the 110 4x4 chassis- the &quot;utility&quot;. This was a five-door 4x4 body but with the rearmost seats removed and the rear side panels left without windows, producing a five-seater vehicle with a secure, weatherproof load space.

The only external design alterations were minor detail changes. The bonnet was reshaped with a pressed bulge to allow the new, taller engine to fit in the engine bay whilst meeting pedestrian safety laws. This also avoided the need to re-design the engine sump to clear the axle. The new dashboard and ventilation system necessitated the removal of the distinctive air vent flaps underneath the windscreen which had been a feature of previous Land Rover utility models since the 1950s. While the flaps were deleted, the bulkhead pressing remained the same, so the outlines of where the flaps would be are still present. Passenger and rear loading doors were re-engineered to reduce corrosion and galvanic reaction. All other panels retained the same shape and styling that is viewed by enthusiasts as &quot;iconic&quot;.

At the other extreme, basic models are available for commercial users, such as emergency services. The models are sold in over 140 countries. A range of special conversions are available that include hydraulic platforms, fire engines, mobile workshops, ambulances, and breakdown recovery trucks. The 130 remains available with the five-seater HCPU bodystyle as standard.

===2012 updates===

In August 2011, Land Rover announced an update of the Defender for the 2012 model year. By this time, Land Rover publicly acknowledged that it was working on a project to produce an all-new replacement for the Defender. This would lead to the unveiling of the first DC100 concept vehicle in September that year. While emissions and safety regulations have threatened the Defender since the early 2000s, these had either been avoided or Land Rover had found ways to modify the vehicle to economically meet the new requirements. However, safety regulations due for introduction in 2015 requiring minimum pedestrian safety standards and the fitment of airbags to commercial vehicles cannot be met without a wholesale redesign of the Defender.

The main change for the 2012 models was the installation of a different engine from the Ford Duratorq engine range. Ford decided, due to cost reasons, not to modify the 2.4-litre engine introduced in 2007 to meet the upcoming Euro V emissions standards and so the engine was replaced with the ZSD-422 engine, essentially a 2.2-litre variant of the same engine. Although smaller than the existing unit the power and torque outputs remained unchanged and the same six-speed gearbox was used as well. The engine included a diesel particulate filter for the first time on a Defender. The only other change was the reintroduction of the soft top body style to the general market. This had been a popular option for the Land Rover Series but by then the introduction of the Defender had been relegated to special order and military buyers only. Land Rover stated that the option was being brought back due to customer feedback. The last Defender, a soft-top &quot;90&quot; rolled off the Solihull production line at 9:22 on Friday 29 January 2016. The BBC reported that the Defender&#x27;s replacement was due to be launched in 2018/2019.

== DC100 Concept ==
The need for total replacement of the Defender has been brought about by 2015&#x27;s new European regulations regarding crash safety for pedestrians (Euro NCAP) that render the Defender&#x27;s design obsolete. The Defender also did not meet U.S. safety requirements after 1997 and since then Land Rover offered U.S. buyers the more luxurious LR2 (Freelander) and LR4 (Discovery) and Range Rover instead.

Land Rover unveiled the DC100 and its topless counterpart, the DC100 Sport, at the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show. The designs of the concept vehicles received some criticism in the press. The DC100 (Defender Concept 100&quot;) is a conventional three-door off-roader with a 2.0-litre turbo-charged diesel engine and the DC100 Sport is a two-passenger pick-up with a 2.0-litre petrol engine. Unlike the current Defender with 93-inch, 110-inch and 130-inch wheelbases, the DC100 was presented in 100-inch wheelbase only.

==2020 Defender (L663; 2020–)==
The 2020 Defender was unveiled on 10 September 2019 at the 2019 Frankfurt Motor Show in Germany. This is the first all-new update for the Defender since 1983. The 2020 Defender has been engineered to comply with global car regulations and is expected to be sold in 128 territories, including the world&#x27;s two largest car markets; China and the United States. As sales pick up for the Defender, the latest L663 generation was spotted running tests in Malaysia, signifying a local launch taking place soon. Fast forward to October 2021, the Malaysian-debut of the L663 Land Rover Defender has taken place.

The L663 Defender is available in either &#x27;90&#x27; three-door or &#x27;110&#x27; five-door guises, but the folks in Solihull wowed fans with the introduction of the Defender &#x27;130&#x27;, an elongated five-door variant with seating for eight adults and more boot space.
==Export and foreign-built versions==
===North American Specification (NAS) Defenders===

In 1993 Land Rover launched the Defender in the North American (i.e. the United States and Canada) market. Although the Range Rover had been sold there since 1987, this was the first time utility Land Rovers had been sold since 1974. To comply with the strict United States Department of Transportation regulations, ranging from crash safety to lighting, as well as the very different requirements of American buyers, the North American Specification (NAS) Defenders were extensively modified. The initial export batch was 525 Defender 110 County 4x4s: 500 to the United States and 25 to Canada. They were fitted with the 3.9-litre V8 petrol engine, LT-77 five-speed manual transmission and LT230 transfer case. All of the vehicles were &quot;Alpine&quot; white (except one specifically painted black for Ralph Lauren). They sported full external roll-cages and larger side-indicator and tail-lights. All were equipped with the factory-fitted air conditioning system.

For the 1994 and 1995 model year Land Rover only offered the Defender 90, fitted with a 3.9-litre V8 engine and the R-380 manual transmission which was clearly intended as an upmarket alternative to the Jeep Wrangler. Initially, the Defender 90 was only available as a soft-top with a structural roll cage, but a later version was offered with a unique, removable, fibre-glass roof panel or a regular 4x4 hard-top designated as the estate model.

The NAS Defender 90 soft top model was essentially a 90SV special edition fitted with the petrol V8 engine from the Range Rover instead of the diesel 200TDi since that engine was already certified for US emissions. Among other changes required for the North American market, Land Rover locally sourced new external lights from Rubbolite and Perei that are commonly used on trailers. 

In 1997, the final year of US Defender 90 production, the engine was improved, designated 4.0 and mated to a four-speed automatic transmission. In 1998, regulations changed to require the fitting of airbags for both front seat passengers in all vehicles, as well as side door impact requirements. The Defender could not be fitted with these without major modifications, which were not economically viable given the small numbers of NAS vehicles sold in relation to Land Rover&#x27;s global sales. Land Rover retired its North American Specification utility vehicles at the end of 1997 to focus on its more profitable, popular and upmarket Discovery and Range Rover models, as well as the then newly launched Freelander.

In 2020 Land Rover brought back the Land Rover Defender only as the 4 door model with 2.0 or 3.0 engine and standard hardtop and automatic transmission. It then brought back the 2-door Defender 90 model for the 2021 model year.

===Land Rover 110 in Australia===
Continuing on from production of the Australian SIII Stage 1 Isuzu 4BD1 diesel variant, Jaguar Rover Australia (JRA) developed an Isuzu 4BD1 (See List of Isuzu engines) diesel powered 110 for sale as an Australia Only consumer product.

Between 1981 and 1990, the Isuzu 4BD1 engine was the only diesel option available for Land Rover in Australia. All 110 cab chassis Defenders sold in Australia during this time had a wheelbase of 120 inches in order to accommodate an 8 ft x 6 ft tray. A small number of 6x6 cab chassis Defenders were also made by JRA during this time. While the Land Rover has been in use in the Australian military from 1959, as a consumer product from the 1970s, it fell out of favour as a 4x4 work vehicle while offerings from Toyota and Nissan increased in popularity. Mid-2009, Land Rover expanded the model range to include 110 and 130 cab-chassis, panel van and HCPU versions, and late in the year announced the re-introduction of the 90 4x4 model for sale from early 2010.

===Defender licensees and clones===
Defenders, derivatives and clones have been built by a number of manufacturers. Most prominent is Santana Motors in Spain, who has built these under license from Land Rover since 1958. They were built from CKD kits until the licence expired in 1983; Land Rover derivatives (Santana Series IV) were then introduced in 1984 and built until 1994. 

Morattab in Iran manufactures it as the &quot;Pazhan&quot;, using a Mitsubishi/Hyundai V6 engine, using parts and molds purchased from Santana. Tempo in West Germany, Minerva in Belgium, Otokar in Turkey (beginning in 1987 and continued until the original production ended), and Karmann in Brazil (from 1999–2006, using Land Rover CKD kits) have also built Defenders and derivatives. 

Via their commercial vehicle arm, Fiat marketed a modified version of the Spanish Santana PS10 (&quot;Aníbal&quot; for the Spanish market). Product as the Iveco Massif between 2007 and 2011, the model was manufactured by the Santana Motor factory in Linares, Spain.

Assembly also occurred in Pakistan, Malaysia and South Africa.

==Special editions==
===Land Rover 90SV===
In 1992 the first special edition Land Rover Defender was produced. Called the 90SV (SV stands for &quot;special vehicles&quot;, as all the vehicles were produced by Land Rover&#x27;s Special Vehicle Operations department), they were painted turquoise and were fitted with a black canvas Tickford soft top with standard door tops. Alloy wheels were also fitted, together with rear disc brakes (a first for a Land Rover). Despite the vehicle&#x27;s sporty looks, it used the standard 200Tdi turbodiesel engine. Only 90 were made for the UK market.

The development of the 90SV paved the way for the North American Defender 90 soft top. Land Rover contracted with Safety Devices to procure roll cages. For the production vehicles Land Rover added padding to the roll cage from the B pillar to the C pillar using a proprietary method. This roll cage was later equipped to the Defender 90 for North America and is commonly known as the NAS roll cage. The prototype vehicle used for marketing materials did not have padding on the roll cage. 

===Limited Edition (LE)===
In 1997, the last year that Defender 90’s were made available in the US, Land Rover created 300 Special Edition Station Wagons. Known as the Limited Edition (LE) these Land Rover Defender 90’s were painted with a unique one year colour known as Willow Green with a contrasting white accented roof; they were also fitted with body protection in the form of 5 large diamond plated sheets and an external safety cage with a full roof rack. The 1997 Land Rover Defender 90 LE also came with the following options as standard equipment: Air conditioning, rear ladder, rear step, twin tube running boards with diamond plate trim, front A bar and a limited edition placard which was affixed to the rear of the car that denoted its build number out of 300.

===Defender 50th===

For Land Rover&#x27;s 50th anniversary in 1998 two special editions were built. The first was the Defender 50th which was essentially a NAS (North American spec) Defender 90. It was powered by a 4.0-litre V8 petrol engine and was the first Land Rover outside North America to be fitted with an automatic transmission. Air conditioning made them very comfortable vehicles. For the UK and Europe they were painted Atlantis blue, a dark green-blue flip-flop colour, and had a Safety Devices roll-over protection cage for the front seat occupants. In total 1071 50th anniversary Defenders were built; 385 for the UK home market, the rest for Japan, Europe and the Middle East.

Land Rover South Africa also built 26 50th Anniversary edition 90s featuring the BMW M52 engine. The vehicles were painted Santorini Blue with special decal graphics on the sides. They also featured &quot;colour-coded wheel arch mouldings, spot lamps, spare wheel carrier, free style alloy wheels, stainless steel A-frame Bullbar, two-tone solid paint, Willards welding and side runners&quot; as well as &quot;leather seats, radio and CD player, leather steering wheel and gear lever as well as a cooler box.&quot; Each was randomly numbered between 1 and 50, as 24 50th Anniversary edition 110s were also built, but with a 300Tdi diesel engine. The 50th Anniversary 110 was called &quot;Safari&quot; and was painted in a limestone green colour. It featured everything included on the 50th Anniversary 90 with the addition of &quot;a roof rack and step ladder, as well as a wrap-around Bullbar in place of the A-frame&quot; and &quot;special cloth seats are used in favour of the leather ones. It is also fitted with a GPS (Pathfinder system).&quot;

===Heritage===
The second 1998 special edition was the &quot;Heritage&quot;, intended to hark back to the early days of Land Rover in the 1940s. Available in 90 or 110 variants, the Heritage was only available in the two original colours offered by the company: the dark bronze green and the light pastel Atlantic green. A metal mesh-effect front grille, body-coloured alloy wheels and wing mirrors and silver-painted door and windscreen hinges were all employed to make the Heritage look similar to the original Series I of 1948. Inside, special instruments were used, with black-on-beige displays. The powertrain was the standard Td5 diesel engine and 5 speed manual transmission.

===Tomb Raider===

Possibly the best known special edition was the &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; of 2000, built to commemorate Land Rover&#x27;s role in the first film of that franchise. The Tomb Raider was designed to look like an off-road expedition vehicle. Painted dark metallic grey with special badging and details, the Tomb Raider came equipped with a roof rack and roof rack support system (looking similar to a roll-cage), additional spot lights, winch, bull-bar and raised air-intake. They were available either as a 90 or a 110 double cab, with standard Td5 engines. The actual Defender used in the film (now on display at the Motor Heritage Centre, Gaydon) was a highly modified 110 HCPU with a specially fitted and tuned V8 petrol engine and a non-standard interior.

===G4 Edition===
Following the first Land Rover G4 Challenge in 2003, G4-Edition Defenders became available. As well as the distinctive Tangiers orange colour of the competition vehicles, yellow, silver and black versions were also produced. Defender 90 and 110 4x4 versions were available, with front A-bar, roll-cage, side-steps and front spotlights as standard, as well as G4 badging.

===Defender Black===
The 2002 Defender Black Limited Edition was produced in 2 variants based on the XS trim level: 90 Station Wagon or a 110 Double Cab Pickup with Java black micatallic paint, ABS &amp; Electronic Traction Control, chequerplate wing top and sill protection, side protection rails (aka XS steps) front roll cage (aka screen protection bar), Boost alloy wheels, a &quot;NAS&quot; rear step / towbar and green tinted windows. The interior has black leather seats, chrome bezel instrument pack, black leather trimmed steering wheel, black carpet &amp; trim, black leather-trimmed cubby box &amp; lid, billet aluminium controls &amp; gear knobs, air conditioning, electric front windows and remote central door locking. Both models used the Td5 engine.

The on-the-road UK prices were £24995 for either model. 92 examples of the 90 were made, and 144 the 110 DCPU. As of 2018, 76 and 103 respectively remained registered in the UK

===Defender Silver===
The Defender Silver was available in three distinct versions: TD5, 90 and 110 Station Wagon and 110 Double Cab Pickup. Every Defender Silver was fitted with an A-frame protection bar which offered additional protection to the front of the vehicle. Lamp guards were fitted front and rear, and a tow pack incorporating an electrics kit not only to power trailer lights, but also additional equipment. The underside was further shielded from harm by the sump guard and air-con and ABS/TC were available as options. The vehicles came of the production line and were then modified by SVO, Special Vehicle Operations. They are comparatively rare, especially the Double Cab Pick Up with the Fiberglass TruckMan Top.

===X-Tech===
The 1999 X-Tech was aimed at the commercial market, being a metallic silver 90 hard top fitted with County-style seats, alloy wheels and Alpine window lights. The second model year edition in 2003 was better equipped with wing protector plates and air conditioning.

===Defender SVX===
2008 saw Land Rover&#x27;s 60th anniversary, for which a new series of special edition Defenders were produced. Branded the &quot;SVX&quot;, three models were built. All were painted black with &quot;satin&quot; effect body graphics on the vehicles&#x27; sides and bonnet carrying the &quot;60th&quot; logo used throughout 2008 at various special events and on anniversary merchandise. Bespoke five-spoke alloy wheels were used and a new silver-coloured front grille design was used. This also incorporated a new design of headlamp with the sidelight lamp being integral with the main headlamp unit, allowing the space previously used for the separate sidelight to be used to fit a pair of high-intensity driving lamps. Inside the SVX models gained Recaro bucket seats in the front row, alloy gearlever knobs and a Garmin GPS navigation system. The drivetrain was the standard 2.4-litre diesel and six-speed manual permanent four-wheel-drive transmission. The SVX edition was available as a 110 (only available outside the UK), a 90 and a brand-new design of 90 soft top- the first time a soft-top model had been available through showrooms in the UK since 1992. SVX soft tops had only the two front seats- the rear load bay being used to accommodate the spare wheel and a lockable storage box. A new design of hood was used, sloping down towards the rear over a jointed folding frame, unlike the standard square-framed hood used on other soft top Land Rovers.
(This unit comes with a 2.4-litre diesel Ford DuraTorq 4 cylinder engine).

===Bespoke Paul Smith Defender===
To mark the end of production, Land Rover asked British fashion designer Paul Smith to produce a one-off version of the Defender, which was launched in May 2015. The car&#x27;s exterior featured 27 different colours on the exterior inspired by the Defender’s long life in service with the Army, Navy and Air Force as well as fire, coastguard and mountain rescue roles but also by the colours of the British countryside where Defenders have long since become part of the landscape.

===2018 Defender Works V8 70th Anniversary Edition===
In January 2018 Land Rover unveiled the Defender Works V8 as part of the Defender&#x27;s 70th Anniversary. The 150 examples feature a naturally-aspirated 5.0-litre Jaguar AJ-V8 engine producing 405 hp (302 kW) and 515 Nm, mated to an 8-speed ZF 8HP automatic gearbox. Land Rover additionally fitted new springs, dampers and anti-roll bars and uprated brakes along with 18&quot; alloy wheels and all-terrain tyres. The 70th Anniversary Defenders were &quot;restomods&quot; produced by Land Rover Classic division and not a new production model. They were late-model, pre-registered Defenders that were carefully selected based on age, mileage, and condition. They were built in both 90 and 110 wheelbases, with a starting price of £150,000.

=== Other special editions ===

There have also been various special editions of the Defender created by the company&#x27;s overseas operations for sale in their specific markets such as the &quot;Sahara&quot; edition and 55th anniversary Defender 90s sold in France; the former being a basic-spec model painted in a sand-like tan colour and supplied with special decals and the latter being a 4x4 fitted with numerous luxury options and special badges in the mould of the factory-built 50th editions. Sometimes individual Land Rover dealers have created limited editions of vehicles to suit their markets. A dealer in Scotland created the &quot;Braemar&quot; edition of 25 vehicles to appeal to local agricultural and forestry buyers, being a 90 hard top supplied ready fitted with a winch, off-road tyres, spotlamps and worklamps, underbody protection and chequer plate. 

Land Rover South Africa built the Land Rover 147, a stretched 7 door estate. The 147 is stretched by 37 inches allowing for an extra door and two seats with a total seating capacity of 11 people.

A specially-commissioned custom-built modified Land Rover Defender TD 130, painted in Edinburgh Green, was used as a hearse for Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, designed by the Duke himself, at his funeral at Windsor Castle. The Defender Hearse had an open-topped rear to hold the coffin.

==Military Defenders==
===British and other armies===

Land Rover Defender vehicles have been used by many of the world&#x27;s military forces as military light utility vehicle, including the US in some limited capacity, following experience with the vehicle during the first Gulf War, where US forces found the British Army&#x27;s vehicles to be more capable and better suited to operation in urban areas and for air-lifting than the Humvee. (&quot;See&quot; U.S. Army Ranger Special Operations Vehicle.) The British Army has used Land Rovers since the 1950s, as have many countries in the Commonwealth of Nations. The British Army replaced its Series III fleet with One Tens in 1985, with a smaller fleet of Nineties following in 1986. Both used the 2.5-litre naturally aspirated diesel engine. These older vehicles are reaching the end of their service lives, with many being sold onto the civilian market from the late 1990s.

In 1994 Land Rover created the Defender XD (XD= extra duty) to replace and complement these vehicles. Powered by 300Tdi engines, the XD has a much stronger chassis, with fibre webbing around the welded joints in the chassis and around stress points to massively increase load capacity. The XD was available both in Defender 90 and 110 forms and is known to the British Army as the Land Rover Wolf. Usually soft or hard tops, they are used for patrol, communications and supply duties. 90XDs are less common, but are generally ordered as soft top or hard top vehicles for light liaison and communications. Short-wheelbase vehicles lack the load capacity needed by modern armies, and the increased power of heavy-lift helicopters has made the larger 110s easily air-transportable- a historic advantage of the smaller, lighter 90.

Land Rover offered its &quot;core&quot; military Defenders with the 300Tdi engine rather than the more powerful but more complicated Td5 engine offered in civilian vehicles. The 300 Tdi Defender went into service in the &quot;Green Fleet&quot; from 1998. Before the 300Tdi engine was introduced, military Land Rovers were offered with 2.5-litre petrol and diesel engines, as well as the 3.5-litre V8 petrol. Trials with the Td5 engine proved it to be reliable in battlefield conditions. However, initially it was decided that servicing and repairing its electronic control systems should they fail was too complicated and reliant on having diagnostic computers available. Land Rover were also unable to guarantee they could make the Td5 resistant to the electromagnetic pulse (EMP) generated by a nuclear weapon.

However, following successful trials by the Australian Defence Force of the TD5 Landrover, the British MOD purchased a small fleet of TD5 Landrover Defender 110s for its &quot;Green Fleet&quot; between 2000 and 2002. These were specially converted for the MOD by Landrover Specialist Vehicles. They were plated with UK military registration plates and painted IRR green. Most of these vehicles were deployed in the Falklands as troop carriers and communications vehicles for use by the Royal Marines and UK Special Forces. A small number of TD5 Defender 110s were also ordered for the Royal Navy. These were painted navy blue and deployed to the Falklands. Of these Royal Navy vehicles a few were later re-painted IRR green and reassigned to Royal Marines and SBS use. The more powerful TD5 engine, which was capable of being re-mapped up to around 200 Bhp was ideally suited to the rugged terrain of the Falklands and for towing trailers. The majority of these Falkland vehicles were sold off to Military Motors Ltd by the MOD in 2013. The troop carriers had eight passenger seats in the rear and two rear side windows each side for extra visibility. Visually, these UK military troop carrier TD5 Defenders looked similar to the ones used by the Australian Defence Force except that the UK ones were plain IRR green.

The Albanian Land Force also possesses a large fleet of Land Rover Defenders, a quantity of them were given by the Turkish and Italian armies and the rest of the fleet were bought.

The Italian Army adopted the Defender 90 in 1991 under the name of &quot;AR 90&quot; (AR standing for &quot;Autovettura da Ricognizione&quot;, Reconnaissance Vehicle), soft top version, with 2.0 petrol engines MPI series, 2.5 diesel Td5 and 2.4 diesel Td4 engines. Another Land Force version is denominated &quot;VAV&quot; (standing vor &quot;Veicolo d&#x27;Attacco Veloce&quot;, Fast Attack Vehicle), carrying a crew of three and armed with NATO 5.56 machine gun and 40 mm grenade launcher. The Defender hard top version in Italy is also adopted by police forces Carabinieri (Defender 90), civil protection forces (Defender 90, 110 and 130), fire fighting squads (Defender 90, 110).

With 300Tdi production stopping in 2006, Land Rover set up production of a military version of the four-cylinder Ford Duratorq engine that is also used as a replacement for the Td5 in civilian vehicles.

The British Army&#x27;s Land Rovers have been the subject of criticism following recent operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The majority of British military Land Rovers carry no armour-plating and the composite-armoured Snatch Land Rover (originally designed to withstand small arms fire and hand-thrown projectiles as experienced in Northern Ireland) is vulnerable to roadside bomb and rocket attacks.

===Australian Army===
The Land Rover Perentie is the Land Rover 110 produced for the Australian Defence Force (ADF).

In the 1980s, using the Australia Only civilian 4BD1 powered 110 as a basis, Jaguar Rover Australia (JRA) developed a military version of the 4BD1 110 model for competitive trials against vehicles supplied by Chrysler JEEP, Mercedes and Toyota conducted by the Australian Army Testing Establishment. Land Rover was the successful candidate and the Australian Army ordered several thousand 110 Land Rovers in various configurations made to this specification, called the Land Rover Perentie, some of which were 6x6 drive. Six wheel drive Perenties were fitted with a turbocharged 3.9L Isuzu diesel engine (4BD1-T), while the 4x4 versions were powered by the naturally aspirated variant (4BD1). The Australian Army vehicles were assembled at the Jaguar Rover Australia (JRA) facility at Moorebank, NSW, from locally made components and other components from the UK and Japan.

==Police and government vehicles==
===United Kingdom===

The British police have used Land Rovers (including the Defender) in their service for many years, they are supplied with the entire range from Land Rover itself. Due to the ongoing terrorist threat and proliferation of public order disturbances, the Police Service of Northern Ireland has employed armoured and hardened versions of the Land Rover Defender for over 40 years in various guises. The current PSNI armoured public order vehicle is based upon a heavy duty Defender 110 chassis which starts life as a chassis cab and which is then stripped of the original body and fitted with upgraded suspension, brakes, and drive train. The bonnet, wings and roof are produced from armoured composite materials whilst the body is manufactured from a range of armoured steel and composite materials and is known as the &quot;Pangolin&quot;.

===Germany===
In 2004 a fleet of 12 long wheelbase 110 Td5 Land Rovers were produced for the federal German government, varying between 110 vans, 110 HCPUs and 110 4x4s. The German government did not renew the supply contract after 2006, instead turning to Mercedes for their logistics fleet.

Vehicles produced for the German government order were produced in metallic grey with white roofs. The electrical installation on these vehicles was a special order and kept &quot;luxury&quot; fittings and fixtures to a bare minimum. Four FFR equipped vehicles were produced to facilitate the VHF radios in service at that time with the German government and police authorities. Following the change-over to the Mercedes contract, the federal German government sold their Td5 fleet.

<text>Sue Gerhardt (Durban, 1953) is a British psychoanalytic psychotherapist in private practice since 1997. She was born in South Africa, but grew up in England. She was educated at Newnham College, University of Cambridge, where she achieved a degree in English literature, and campaigned successfully for women to be given places in the previously single sex men&#x27;s colleges. She was an active feminist. She was trained as a psychotherapist and achieved an MA in Child Observation at the Tavistock Clinic in London. In 1998 she co-founded the Oxford Parent Infant Project (OXPIP), a pioneering charity that provides psychotherapeutic help to parents and babies in Oxfordshire. She has two adult children and lives in Oxfordshire.

==&#x27;Why Love Matters&#x27;==
Gerhardt is best known as the author of the bestselling and critically acclaimed &quot;Why Love Matters: How Affection Shapes a Baby&#x27;s Brain&quot; (2004). The book presents evidence that babies&#x27; brains develop differently in the first few months of life depending on the amount and type of care they receive in that time. The evidence suggests that the prefrontal cortex and, within that, the orbitofrontal area are stimulated and interconnect more powerfully when a child is demonstrably loved. The advantage of positive development is increased confidence and an ability to empathise with others. Neglect can lead to increased anxiety, insensitivity and aggression.

The findings may have political implications, since the demand for parents to reduce the time they spend with their child because of work commitments leads to an increased emphasis on institutional child care.

There are also implications for gender politics as women are frequently expected to take on the burden of child care, rather than the father, and this developmental finding could be used to argue for a reduced role for women in the workplace.

Gerhardt commented: &quot;I think that the Women’s Movement was an unfinished revolution. We ended up joining the working world as defined by men and struggling to live on its terms. I think we got stuck in trying to live up to male-defined expectations. That world (including male-dominated governments) didn’t (and still doesn’t) take into account the fact that babies or small children need very personal one-to-one care. Because we were so determined to escape domesticity, I think we feminists had a bit of a blind spot around children’s emotional needs and ignored this uncomfortable fact.&quot;

<text>Point de mire was a popular Quebec information show on Radio-Canada that aired from 1956 to 1959. The television show is famous for being hosted by a future cabinet minister and Premier of Quebec, René Lévesque.

A trademark of the show was the pedagogy of Lévesque, explaining with a chalkboard and clarifying world events to his viewers. This same technique developed at &quot;Point de mire&quot; he would later use often on television, or in person, to explain political plans and convictions, ranging from the nationalization of electricity during the Quiet Revolution to Quebec independence.

<text>The Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) is a spectrograph, also with a camera mode, installed on the Hubble Space Telescope. Aerospace engineer Bruce Woodgate of the Goddard Space Flight Center was the principal investigator and creator of the STIS. It operated continuously from 1997 until a power supply failure in August 2004. After repairs, it began operating again in 2009. The spectrograph has made many important observations, including the first spectrum of the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet, HD 209458b.

The STIS was installed on Hubble in 1997 during its second servicing mission (STS-82) by Mark Lee and Steven Smith, replacing the High Resolution Spectrograph and the Faint Object Spectrograph. It was designed to operate for five years. On August 3, 2004, an electronic failure rendered STIS inoperable, ending its use 2 years beyond its predicted lifespan. In order to bring it back to operational status, the instrument was repaired by space shuttle astronauts during STS-125, Servicing Mission 4, launched on May 11, 2009. The crew did a long (many hour) EVA to repair the instrument.

==Design==
STIS is both a spectrograph and an imaging camera, and is focused on ultraviolet light.

The STIS has three 1024×1024 detector arrays. The first is a charge-coupled device with a 52×52 arc-second field of view, covering the visible and near-infrared spectrum from 200 nm to 1030 nm.

The other two detectors are Multi-Anode Multichannel Arrays, each with a 25×25 arc-second field of view. One is Cs2Te, and covers the near-UV between 160 nm and 310 nm. The other is CsI and covers the far-UV between 115 nm and 170 nm.

==Timeline==

*February 14, 1997- STIS installed (STS-82)
* 2001, Switches to Side-2 electronics after a failure in side-1.
*August 3, 2004- STIS goes offline due to side-2 power-failure
*2009- STIS repaired (STS-125)
* Operating on side-2 electronics with all optical and UV channels.

==Selected discoveries and observations==
On its 20th anniversary (1997-2017) NASA noted a selection of discoveries and/or observations conducted with STIS:
*Survey of 20 galaxies to look for black holes
*Study of the Intergalactic Medium
*Study of the Galactic Halo

<text>The Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) is a scientific instrument for infrared astronomy, installed on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), operating from 1997 to 1999, and from 2002 to 2008. Images produced by NICMOS contain data from the near-infrared part of the light spectrum.

NICMOS was conceived and designed by the NICMOS Instrument Definition Team centered at Steward Observatory, University of Arizona, USA. NICMOS is an imager and multi-object spectrometer built by Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies Corp. that allows the HST to observe infrared light, with wavelengths between 0.8 and 2.4 micrometers, providing imaging and slitless spectrophotometric capabilities. NICMOS contains three near-infrared detectors in three optical channels providing high (~ 0.1 arcsecond) resolution, coronagraphic and polarimetric imaging, and slitless spectroscopy in 11-, 19-, and 52-arcsecond square fields of view. Each optical channel contains a 256×256 pixel photodiode array of mercury cadmium telluride infrared detectors bonded to a sapphire substrate, read out in four independent 128×128 quadrants.

NICMOS last worked in 2008, and has been largely replaced by the infrared channel of Wide Field Camera 3 after its installation in 2009.

==Limitations==

The infrared performance of the Hubble has limitations since it was not designed with infrared performance as an objective. For example, the mirror is kept at a stable and relatively high temperature (15 °C) by heaters.

HST is a warm telescope. The IR background flux collected by cooled focal plane IR instruments like NICMOS or WFC3 is dominated, at rather short wavelengths, by telescope thermal emission rather than by zodiacal scattering. NICMOS data show that the telescope background exceeds the zodiacal background at wavelengths longer than λ ≈ 1.6μm, the exact value depending on the pointing on the sky and on the position of the Earth on its orbit.

Despite this, the combination of Hubble&#x27;s mirror and NICMOS offered never-before seen levels of quality in near-infrared performance at that time. Dedicated infrared telescopes like the Infrared Space Observatory were ground-breaking in their own way, but had a smaller primary mirror, and were also out of service at the time of NICMOS installation because they ran out of coolant. NICMOS later overcame this problem by using a machine chiller like a refrigerator, which allowed it operate for years until it went offline in 2008.

==History of NICMOS==

NICMOS was installed on Hubble during its second servicing mission in 1997 (STS-82) along with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph, replacing two earlier instruments. NICMOS in turn has been largely superseded by the Wide Field Camera 3, which has a much larger field of view (135 by 127 arcsec, or 2.3 by 2.1 arcminutes), and reaches almost as far into the infrared.


When conducting infrared measurements, it is necessary to keep the infrared detectors cooled to avoid having infrared interference from the instrument&#x27;s own thermal emissions. NICMOS contains a cryogenic dewar, that cooled its detectors to about 61 K, and optical filters to ~ 105 K, with a block of solid nitrogen ice. When NICMOS was installed in 1997, the dewar flask contained a 230-pound (104 kg) block of nitrogen ice. Due to a thermal short that arose on March 4, 1997, during the instrument commissioning, the dewar ran out of nitrogen coolant sooner than expected in January 1999.

During Hubble Service Mission 3B in 2002 (STS-109), a replacement cooling system comprising a cryocooler, cryogenic circulator, and external radiator was installed on the Hubble that now cools NICMOS through a cryogenic neon loop. The NICMOS Cooling System (NCS) was developed on a very accelerated schedule (14 months vs. 5–10 years for other Hubble instrument hardware). NICMOS was returned to service soon after SM 3B.

A new software upload in September 2008 necessitated a brief shutdown of the NICMOS cooling system. Several attempts to restart the cooling system were unsuccessful due to issues with the cryogenic circulator. After waiting more than six weeks for parts of the instrument to warm up, and theorized ice particles to sublimate from the neon circulating loop, the cooler once again failed to restart. An Anomaly Review Board (ARB) was then convened by NASA. The ARB concluded that ice or other solid particle migrated from the dewar to the circulator during the September 2008 restart attempt and that the circulator may be damaged, and determined an alternative set of startup parameters. A successful restart at 13:30 EST on 16 December 2008 led to four days of cooler operations followed by another shutdown. On 1 August 2009, the cooler was restarted again; NICMOS was expected to resume operations in mid-February 2010 and operated through October 22, 2009, at which point a lock-up of Hubble&#x27;s data handling system caused the telescope to shut down. The circulation flow rate to NICMOS was greatly reduced during this operating period confirming blockage in the circulation loop. Continued operation at reduced flow rates would limit NICMOS science so plans for purging and refilling the circulation system with clean neon gas were developed by NASA. The circulation loop is equipped with an extra neon tank and remotely operated solenoid valves for on-orbit purge-fill operations. As of 2013, these purge-fill operations have not yet been performed.

WFC3, installed 2009, was designed to partly replace NICMOS.

On June 18, 2010, it was announced NICMOS would not be available for science during the latest proposal Cycle 18. As of 2013, a decision as to whether the purge-fill operations will be performed and whether NICMOS will be available for science in the future has not been made.

NICMOS is also the name of the device&#x27;s 256×256-pixel imaging sensor built by Rockwell International Electro-Optical Center (now DRS Technologies).

==Scientific results==

NICMOS was noted for its performance in Near-infrared space astronomy, in particular its ability to see objects through dust. It was used for about 23 months after it was installed, its life limited by set amount of cryo-coolant, and then later it was used for several years when a new cryo-cooler was installed in 2002. NICMOS combined near infrared performance with a large mirror.

NICMOS allowed investigation of high redshift galaxies and quasars with high spatial resolution, which was especially useful when analyzed in conjunction with other instruments such as the STIS, and it also allowed deeper investigation of stellar populations. In planetary science, NICMOS was used to discover an impact basin on the south pole of the asteroid 4 Vesta. (4 Vesta was later visited by Dawn (spacecraft) in the 2010s which investigated it more closely by orbiting it.)

In 2009, an old NICMOS image was processed to show a predicted exoplanet around the star HR 8799. The system is thought to be about 130 light-years from Earth.

In 2011, around that same star, four exoplanets were rendered viewable in a NICMOS image taken in 1998, using advanced data processing. The exoplanets were originally discovered with the Keck telescopes and the Gemini North telescope between 2007 and 2010. The image allows the orbits of the exoplanets to be analyzed more closely, since they take many decades, even hundreds of Earth years, to orbit their host star.

NICMOS observed the exoplanet XO-2b at star XO-2, and a spectroscopy result was obtained for this exoplanet in 2012. This uses the spectroscopic abilities of the instrument, and in astronomy spectroscopy during a planetary transit (an exoplanet passes in front of star from the perspective of Earth) is a way to study that exoplanet&#x27;s possible atmosphere.

In 2014, researchers recovered planetary discs in old NICMOS data using new image processing techniques.
