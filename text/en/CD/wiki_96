<text>The 2nd King Edward VII&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles) was a rifle regiment of the British Indian Army before being transferred to the British Army on India&#x27;s independence in 1947. The 4th Battalion joined the Indian Army as the 5th Battalion, 8th Gorkha Rifles (Sirmoor Rifles), where it exists to this day. As part of the British Army, the regiment served in Malaya, Hong Kong and Brunei until 1994 when it was amalgamated with the other three British Army Gurkha infantry regiments to form the Royal Gurkha Rifles. It is the only Gurkha regiment which did not have a khukuri on its cap badge.

== History ==

===Formation and early service===
The regiment was first raised in 1815 as The Sirmoor Battalion. This was the first Gurkha unit in the service of the East India Company to see action, during the 3rd Mahratta War in 1817. The regiment, by now named the 8th (Sirmoor) Local Battalion, gained its first battle honour at Bhurtpore in 1825. During the First Sikh War, the regiment fought at Bhudaiwal and Sobraon, as well as the Battle of Aliwal. Personnel carried colours at the time, and the flagpole was broken by cannon fire. The colour itself was seized by the Sikhs but reclaimed by a small party of Gurkhas led by a Havildar who chopped their way into the densely packed enemy lines.

During the Indian Mutiny, the Sirmoor Battalion was one of the Indian regiments that remained loyal to Britain. It was during this that the regiment took part in the defence of Hindu Rao&#x27;s House, near Delhi. For their part in the action, the Sirmoor Battalion was presented with the Queen&#x27;s Truncheon, which became a replacement for the colours that they relinquished when the regiment became a rifle regiment in 1858. With the decision to number the Gurkha regiments in 1861, the Sirmoor Rifles became the 2nd Gúrkha Regiment. In 1876, the battalion acquired a royal patron in the then Prince of Wales, becoming the 2nd (Prince of Wales&#x27;s Own) Gúrkha Regiment (the Sirmoor Rifles).

===First World War===
During the First World War, the 2nd Gurkhas (by now named the 2nd King Edward&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles), along with the other regiments of the Gurkha Brigade, served initially in Flanders. In 1915, the 2nd Battalion moved to Egypt, before returning to India in 1916. The 1st Battalion went to Persia and Mesopotamia in 1916, assisting in the fall of Baghdad. In 1919 it was assigned to the Norperforce in Iran.

===Second World War===
The Second World War saw the 2nd Gurkhas serving in many different theatres; the 1st Battalion was initially in Cyprus before moving to North Africa as part of 7th Indian Infantry Brigade, 4th Indian Division, where it fought at El Alamein. Following this it took part in the invasion of Italy, taking part in the battle for Monte Cassino. The 2nd Battalion meanwhile spent much of the war as prisoners of the Japanese after being captured in Malaya. The 3rd Battalion (raised during the war) took part in the Chindit operations in Burma in 1943.

===Indian independence===
In 1947, as part of India&#x27;s independence, it was agreed that the Gurkha regiments would be split between the British and Indian armies—the British Army would take on four regiments (the 2nd, 6th, 7th and 10th), while the Indian Army would retain the rest.

While the 2nd Gurkhas became one of the four Gurkha regiments to transfer to the British Army, the regiment&#x27;s 4th Battalion was transferred to the Indian Army as 5th Battalion, 8th Gurkha Rifles (Sirmoor Rifles) where it exists to this day. The first Indian commanding officer of this battalion, Lieutenant Colonel (later Brigadier) Nisi Kanta Chatterji, requested Army Headquarters, to let the battalion keep the title &#x27;Sirmoor Rifles&#x27;, which was accepted. This battalion saw action in the 1965 Indo-Pakistan War (as part of the 3rd (Independent) Armoured Brigade, 28 and 191 Infantry Brigades) where it stopped the advance of the Pakistani armour to Akhnur in the Battle of the Fatwal Ridge. In the 1971 war against Pakistan, the battalion now as part of the 68th Mountain Brigade, the corps reserves, once again saw fierce action in the defence of Chamb-Akhnur. It launched five successful counterattacks and recaptured the bridge over the Tawi river.

It also fought in the Indian North east against the Naga insurgents and in the Doda district of Jammu and Kashmir. Here it distinguished itself by killing the Supreme Commander of the Hizbul Mujahideen, the leading Kashmiri insurgent group. It was awarded the Northern Army Commanders Citation in 1998. It was deployed in Sierra Leone as part of UNAMSIL and distinguished itself in Operation &quot;Khukri&quot; in which the Revolutionary United Front rebels were decisively defeated.

===Post Indian independence===
Following this, the 2nd Gurkhas spent several years in the Far East, initially during the Malayan Emergency from 1948 to 1960. Following this, the regiment&#x27;s two battalions alternated between Malaya, Borneo, Brunei and Hong Kong, before receiving a regimental depot at Church Crookham in Hampshire. In 1992, while serving in Hong Kong, the 1st and 2nd Battalions amalgamated to form a single 1st Battalion. This was followed in 1994 by the regiment being amalgamated with the 6th Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles to form the 1st Battalion, Royal Gurkha Rifles.

*1910–1936: F.M. King George V
*1977–1994: F.M. King Charles III

==Regimental Colonels==
Colonels of the Regiment were:
*1946–1956: Lt-Gen. Sir Francis Ivan Simms Tuker, KCIE, CB, DSO, OBE, FRGS, FRSA
*1956–1969: Maj-Gen. Lewis Henry Owain Pugh, CB, CBE, DSO
*1969–1976: Brig. Simon Patrick Martin Kent, CBE
*1976–1986: F.M. Edwin Noel Westby Bramall, The Baron Bramall, KG, GCB, OBE, MC, KStJ 
*1986–1994: F.M. Sir John Lyon Chapple, KCB, CBE 
*&quot;1994: Regiment amalgamated with 6th Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles, 7th Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles and 10th Princess Mary&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles to form The Royal Gurkha Rifles&quot;

==Uniforms==
After a brief period of wearing their own indigenous clothing, the Sirmoor battalion adopted green jackets with red facings. These were worn with loose fitting blue trousers and a bonnet like headdress. By 1828 black facings, black leather equipment, white trousers and sandals had been issued. A variety of changes followed but the round Kilmarnock cap with red and black dicing had appeared by 1848.

While the Kilmarnock was to become common to all Gurkha regiments, the red trim was to remain a distinctive feature of the 2nd Gurkha Rifles. In 1858 links forged during the Siege of Delhi led to the authorization of the Gurkha regiment to adopt the red piping and facings of the British 60th Rifles. Formally recognized as a rifle regiment since 1850 the 2nd Gurkha Regiment underwent various changes of title as recorded above. Throughout it wore the standard Gurkha parade and cold weather uniform of rifle green with leggings and then puttees, silver insignia and black metal buttons. A red toorie (bobble) on the cap was to remain a distinction of the 2nd Gurkha Rifles. In 1883 khaki (initially blue/grey) hot weather dress was adopted. The broad brimmed hat was worn with khaki drill service dress from 1902 and was retained as normal uniform between the two world wars. After World War I the historic rifle green was limited to a few limited dress orders such as officers&#x27; mess uniforms and full dress for mess orderlies. During World War II red and black patches were worn on the jungle slouch hats.

<text>Lapithos or Lapethos (; ) is a town in Cyprus. &quot;De facto&quot;, it is under the control of Northern Cyprus.

Archeologists claim that Lapithos was founded by the Achean brothers Praxandros and Cepheus.
According to Strabo, the ancient settlement of Lapathus, the site of which is nearby, was founded by Spartans.

In Assyrian inscriptions, Lapithos is mentioned as one of the eleven Cypriot kingdoms. During the Persian rule, Lapithos was settled by Phoenicians for a while. The last independent king Praxippos was subdued by Ptolemy I in 312 BC.

Lambousa is the name currently used for the ancient Greek town on the coast about north of the current Lapithos.

Strabo wrote that Lapethos is a &#x27;construction of the Laconians and of Praxandros&#x27;. The philosopher Alexander of Ephesus called it &quot;Imeroessa&quot;, meaning &quot;attractive&quot; and &quot;passion-arousing&quot;.

Lapithos is usually referred in archaeological literature as a Laconian colony built after the Trojan War, by Praxandros, its first king. However, findings from excavations i.e. pots and pottery wheels date back its existence as early as 3000 BC. According to Diodoros of Sicily, who wrote in the 4th century BC, Lapithos was one of the nine kingdoms of Cyprus.

Peisistratos, king of Lapithos, with his flotilla, together with Nicocreon of Salamis and Stasanor of Curion, came to the aid of Alexander the Great, helping him to capture Tyre in Phoenicia. For this reason Alexander, the victorious army commander, declared Cyprus free from the Persians. The last king of Lapethos was Praxippos.

===Roman, Byzantine and Lusignan periods===

During the period of the Roman Empire, Lapethos had more than 10,000 inhabitants. It formed one of the four districts of Cyprus. From ancient times, Lapithos became a centre for the processing of copper and more importantly an earthenware centre.

During the proto-Christian period (25 BC – 250 AD) Lapethos experienced a great commercial drive because of the plethora of its produce, but also because of its port and its shipyard. During this period Lapethos was given the name Lambousa, &quot;shining&quot;, maybe because of its shining wealth or because of its shining beauty and cleanliness or because of its lighthouse, which shed shining light to the surrounding region.

During the first years of Christianity the apostles Paul, Barnabas and Mark passed by Lapethos coming from Tarsus. According to Apostle Barnabas, Lapethos had city walls. He cites that during his second tour with Apostle Mark, they stayed outside the walls because they were not given access to the city. In late antiquity, Lapethos enjoyed great prosperity in commerce as well as in riches, art and development. Bishop of Lapithos Theodotos (c. 314–324) died a martyr in Kyrenia while Bishop Didymos was represented at the 4th Ecumenical Synod (451) by Saint Eulaleus or Eulampius, whose chapel can still be found near the Acheiropoietos Monastery.

Lapethos was heavily damaged during the Arab incursions. The population often had to flee and take refuge in the interior.

Upon the Byzantine recovery of Cyprus from the Arabs in 965, Lapithos&#x27;s refugees returned to their town to rebuild it in a new location, but chose to stay away from the sea, relocating it to the foot of mountain Pentadactylos.

During the Lusignan period, Lapithos boasted a greater population than Limassol, Famagusta or Paphos. 3000 troops were stationed at Lapithos under the command of Zanetto Dandolo in the years preceding the Ottoman conquest of Cyprus in 1571. Dandolo was killed during the defence of Nicosia.

===Ottoman period===
In 1780 a section of Lapithos was split off to form a new village, Karavas.

===British rule===

Lapithos became a municipality soon after the transfer of power to the British rule, with Andreas Koumides becoming the first mayor.

== Archaeological Excavations ==
Close to Lapithos there is a big grave burial from the Bronze Age (ca. 2000–1800 BCE) with hundreds of graves. John Myres did an excavation here in 1913 and Menelaos Markides in 1917. Furthermore, gravediggers have looted the site multiple times.

=== The Swedish Cyprus Expedition ===
The Swedish Cyprus Expedition excavated around 25 sites in Cyprus during four years, 1927–1931. Some of these sites were at Lapithos and the excavations here resulted in a multitude of ceramics and weapons made of copper and bronze. They also found delicate proboscis jugs with elongated necks (beak spouted) and shiny red paint, which are similar to contemporary ceramics from Anatolia. 
The oldest settlement, dating from the Neolithic or Chalcolithic period, is located to the west of the village of Lapithos and is called Alonia ton Plakon. This place was damaged by humans and natural causes during the course of history, therefore, the area of the settlement are difficult to define. The eastern settlement’s preservation was deteriorated because of winter floods and Roman, Byzantine, and modern cultivation. Therefore, only a few remains of houses were found, such as some stone foundation walls, hearths and three bothroi cut into the rock. The site probably had four periods of habitations. After the site was abandoned, it was disturbed in the Geometric period when the place was used as a necropolis, therefore the archaeologists found tombs cut into the rock. During this period, they used stones from the foundations of the Neolithic houses as doors to the tombs. The western settlement contained remains of four huts. Three hearths were found here as well. The finds were mainly of three classes: objects of flint, stone and pottery. The brown coloured flint is very common. The stone objects are mostly axe heads, hammers and chisels. Most of the pottery belonged to these classes: red polished ware, plain white ware and painted ware. The settlements are dated to 3000 B.C., although the Eastern settlement should be dated a bit earlier than the western.

To the west of Lapithos, at Vrysi tou Barba, (Greek. Grandfather’s fountain) the expedition continued to excavate a Bronze Age necropolis. The site consists of a white limestone rock, sloping towards the sea, and have been affected by repeated flooding from the mountain streams, therefore there’s not many traces left of the necropolis today. The swedes were not the first to excavate here although they were the first to publish their investigations. Both John Myres and Menelaos Markides from the Cyprus Museum, excavated here in 1913 and 1917. The Swedish Cyprus Expedition excavated twenty-three tombs for two months with the purpose to obtain a representative series of tombs from a limited area. Most of the tombs found here is in the dromos type, with three circular chambers that open up from the dromos. They used thin slabs of local limestone as doors, and smaller stones around the sides to keep the bigger limestone in place. The excavators could noticed that the tombs were used repeatedly and sometimes cleared out between the burials. Both men and women were buried here. Most of the tombs are dated to the Early Cypriote II Middle Cypriote II period but was used during the Early Cypriote III as well. In the tombs they found a lot of pottery belonging to the Red Polished Ware.

After the excavation at Vrysi tou Barba the Swedish Cyprus Expedition continued with the Iron age necropolis of Kastros from November 1927 until the end of April 1928. This site had never been excavated before but was plundered in Byzantine times. Here the Swedish Cyprus Expedition excavated around thirty graves. The Iron age tombs were cut into the rock. The shape of the tombs differs throughout the different periods but most of them are different kinds of dromos tombs. As seen on many necropolises in Cyprus a lot of the tombs were used for repeated but successive burials which indicate that they were family graves. Some of the graves were extremely rich in grave goods. For example, tomb 403 and 420, where women were buried carrying gold jewellery and other gold ornaments such as five gold plaques with figural representations, spindle whorls, as well as mountings that probably once decorated a headgear.

==Geography==
Situated about 14 kilometres west of Kyrenia, on the northern coast of Cyprus, on the East it borders with Karavas, on the West with Basileia, on its south with the villages of Sysklhpos, Agridaki, and Larnaka tis Lapithou. It spreads from the high mountains of Pentadactylos to the waters of the Mediterranean. In fact, it rests against the background of the highest peak of Pentadactylos, the Kyparissovouno.

==Economy==
Civil servants and workers constitute the majority of the working population. Tourism, agriculture, small-scale industry and fishing are also important sources of income, practised by the rest of the population.

=== Agriculture ===
Thanks to its spring, Lapithos has rich water resources and fertile land. This results in an agricultural sector with a diverse range of products. Citrus is a major product, the lemons of Lapithos are especially renowned. In the hills, olive and carob trees grow. Among other trees and crops cultivated are pistachio, konari and kolokas/kolokasi. Mulberry trees are also planted and provide the protection of lemon trees from the salt and winds of the sea, as well as the silk that is used in the silk industry and handicrafts. Lapithos also has a great variety of plums, including the &quot;flokkaroues&quot; variety unique to the town.

==Politics==
=== Turkish Cypriot municipality ===
The Municipality of Lapithos (Lapta) that &quot;de facto&quot; administers the town was founded on 19 November 1974 by the cabinet of the Autonomous Turkish Cypriot Administration. The current mayor is Fuat Namsoy of the National Unity Party. He has been in this position since 1994.

=== Greek Cypriot municipality ===
The Municipality of Lapithos was established in 1878 by the British as one of the ten new municipalities after the beginning of their rule in Cyprus. The municipality has horned Athena on its logo, in reference to an ancient coin found in Lapithos. In 1974, this municipality was forced into exile, and its municipal council operating then stayed at their positions until 1987. The municipality is currently located at 37 Ammochostou Street and shares its headquarters with the municipality-in-exile of Kythrea. The current mayor-in-exile is Neoptolemos Kotsapas.

Before 1974, the village was administratively divided into six parishes (), each with its own civil and religious administration, community council, an ecclesiastical authority with a Greek Orthodox priest, and cemetery. The parishes were as follows:

* Upper Lapithos: the parishes of Ayia Anastasia and Ayia Paraskevi, collectively referred as the Pano Enories (Upper Parishes)
* Ayios Theodhoros in the west
* Timios Prodhromos in the centre
* Ayios Loukas in the centre
* Ayios Minas in the east.

In addition to these parishes, the seventh administrative division was the Turkish Cypriot quarter.

==Churches and mosques==

Lapithos has 14 churches, two mosques and two monasteries. These include:
* Saint Theodoros Church: The church was built in 1834. It has two white pillars with Byzantine crosses in its yard a gallery section dated to the 17th century, with well-painted doors. It is rumoured to have previously been a chapel in a cemetery, and also has an olive press.
* Saint Minas Church: Located in the east, the church was built in 1843. The church has icons of Saint Minas on a horse, it also used to have a large icon of Saint Minas from the early 18th century.
* Saint Anastasia Church and Monastery: The church is located on a position that overlooks Lapithos, where the former Lapithos Castle used to stand. It was built in the 18th century and has many religious depictions on the walls. It has a chapel dedicated to Ayia Evdokia.
* Saint Paraskevi Church: It was built next to the ruins of an old church in 1892 and housed icons from this old church until 1974, when they were looted following the invasion.
* Saint Luka Church: It was built in 1850. It has been renovated and is now used as a ballet school.
* Timios Prodromos Church: The church is in the centre of Lapithos. It was built in the 17th century in the Gothic style. The bell tower has depictions of human faces, animals and plants. The west side has a Star of David on the walls.
* Saint Evlalios Church: The church is located at the coast, to the east of the Acheiropoietos Monastery and is dedicated to Saint Evlalios, who was a bishop who once lived in Lambousa. The present-day church was built on the ruins of an early Christian church, whose remains still stand in the form of the four columns of the central arches of the present-day church. One of these columns has a Byzantine cross engraved in it. In excavations, three different layers of mosaic tiles from three different eras have been found. This indicates that the church has been renovated in the 6th, 11th and 14th–15th centuries.
* Saint Evlambios Church: To the east of the Ahkiropietos Monastery, the church was used as a pagan tomb and was later converted to a chapel in the early Christian era. The niches are characteristic of Roman tombs and traces of frescoes are present. It has no narthex, but does have an abscess.

The mosques are as follows:
* Haydar Pashazade Mehmet Bey Mosque: There is an engraving in the mosque indicating the year of 1870, this could be the date of the renovation or the construction of the mosque. It has a unique feature in terms of its architecture in Cyprus: a dome covers the prayer area and rests on an octagonal drum and a small half dome at the four corners. Due to its unique Ottoman architecture, it has been described as &quot;one of the island&#x27;s most handsome stone mosques&quot;.
* Esseyid Elhaç Mehmet Agha Mosque, also known as the Upper Lapta Mosque: It is made of hewn stone and has a rectangular structure. It was first built by the tax collector Esseyid Elhaç Mehmet Agha in 1828, but this mosque had an earthen roof and no minaret. Between 1887 and 1889, the Sayed Mehmet Agha Foundation, led by the trustee Hadji Veli Effendi, built a patio, tile roof coverings and a 25-foot minaret. In 1899, there was also a school that belonged to the same foundation. The hewn stone minaret on the mosque&#x27;s eastern side was demolished in 1974 and the present-day concrete minaret was constructed in 1976.

== Culture ==
The town annually hosts the Lapta Tourism Festival in the first week of June. Numerous cultural and sporting activities, folk dance shows by groups from various countries and concerts take place during the festival.

Lapithos has a unique needlework with original patterns, known as the Lapta lace (). The handicraft is still preserved as a product for tourists, and is made on linen fabric with the cross-stitch technique. Lapithos have also produced the culturally important walnut wood chests for Cyprus. The town also has a tradition of knife-making; its knives traditionally had handles made of goat horn and were known for the sharpness and workmanship. The town is one of the most important silk-producing centres in the island and has been historically that way. The silk is used locally and island-wide in handicrafts and for weaving.

Lapithos hosts a vibrant sports life concentrated on the sea. Water sports such as diving, windsurfing, jet-skiing, water-skiing and parasailing are popular. Horse riding and cycling are also practised. The town is the centre of several hiking trails protected by Natura 2000; these trails pass through the area&#x27;s forests, ruins of ancient cities and temples, churches and historical warehouses. The town is home to the football club Lapta Türk Birliği S.K. They played in Süper Lig, the top-level division of Turkish Cypriot football in the 2014–15 season, but were relegated as they attained the last place.

The average temperature is , while during the night it reaches . 

Due to the geography, the inhabitants historically, have been nomadic. In modern times, people have migrated to urban centres during the drought in the 1970s and the early 1980s. There are a few sedentary cultivators, who are located only in the Southern regions of the country.

<text>Peter Kops (born 1967), known professionally as Extince (also known as &quot;Exter-O-naldus&quot; or &quot;De Exter&quot;), is one of the first Dutch language rappers, or Dutch Hip-Hoppers to achieve a top-40 hit in the mainstream Dutch music charts. His hit song &quot;Spraakwater&quot; rose into the top-ten, and was a historic breakthrough for Dutch-language rap &amp; hip-hop – even more than for the artist himself.

Extince was born as Peter Kops in Oosterhout, Netherlands. One of his biggest musical influences as a child was Creedence Clearwater Revival.

==Overview==
His first successful song, &quot;The Milkshake Rap&quot;, was written completely in the English language. His first song in Dutch, &quot;Spraakwater&quot;, was an immediate hit upon its release in 1995. It contains samples from the famous Dutch children&#x27;s television series De Fabeltjeskrant. Another important Dutch hip-hop group, Osdorp Posse, recorded a parody of &quot;Spraakwater&quot; called &quot;Braakwater&quot;.

Extince&#x27;s second hit was &quot;Kaal of Kammen&quot;, released in 1996 as a response to &quot;Braakwater&quot;. His first album, &quot;Binnenlandse Funk&quot; (&quot;Domestic Funk&quot;), came out in 1998. It was in the Dutch Top 40 for two months, and reached number 12 at its peak. One of the most popular songs on this album was &quot;Viervoeters&quot;.

Extince released a second album, &quot;Vitamine E&quot;, in 2001. Its most popular song was released &quot;Grootheidswaan&quot;. In January 2004, he released a third album, &quot;2e jeugd&quot;. In 2007 he released the album &quot;Toch?&quot;.

After some years of relative silence, Extince released a new album in 2015.

<text>The Van Noy Railway News and Hotel Company, known today as HMSHost, was a business founded by the Van Noy Brothers of Kansas City, Missouri, which developed at the beginning of the twentieth century to provide services to travelers aboard passenger trains. At a time when most passenger trains carried neither dining cars nor lounge cars, private businessmen such as the Van Noys recognized a profit opportunity by operating eating houses at railroad junction points and selling snacks and novelties aboard the trains.

==History==
In 1893, Ira Clinton Van Noy formed a retail cigar and news business at No. 1076 Union Avenue, in Kansas City, Missouri. Four years later, on July 26, 1897, he joined with two of his brothers, Charles S. Van Noy and J.L. Van Noy, along with G.W. Krebs of St. Louis, to incorporate the Van Noy Railroad News Company. Railroad &#x27;news services&#x27; generally sold magazines, newspapers, books, tobacco products, fruits, nuts, and novelties from newsstands located in train stations and by the use of a &#x27;news butch&#x27;, a young man who walked through the train making sales. As the business flourished, the Van Noy brothers became prominent members of local Kansas City society. I.C. Van Noy, the eldest brother, served as president of the company, and the youngest brother, Henry Clay Van Noy, also joined the company when he came of age.

The Van Noy Railroad News Company grew rapidly after securing large contracts with Missouri Pacific Railway and its subsidiary, the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway. In the era before dining cars were carried on trains, Van Noy eating houses were established at points along the Missouri Pacific system to feed passengers. Later, at important terminals and train crew division points, Van Noy hotels were constructed to house both travelers and railroad train crews laying over between trips. Reflecting the success of the company, in 1909 both I.C. Van Noy and C.S. Van Noy constructed large homes at 6700-6800 Elmwood in Kansas City. The two homes were added the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.

By 1910, the Van Noy Railroad News Company controlled sales distribution along of railroad. The Company also had 52 hotels and restaurants, 20 concession stores, and 21 distribution offices. The employee count at this time was about 1,600. In 1912, the company name was changed to the Van Noy Railway Hotel and News Company, reflecting the company&#x27;s increased emphasis on the hotel side of the business.

In 1916, when he was 15 years old, Walt Disney spent a summer working for the Van Noy Interstate Company as a news butch, selling merchandise on various rail lines radiating out of Kansas City. His first run was from Kansas City to Jefferson City on the Missouri Pacific Railroad, but he also made runs on the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway, and Kansas City Southern Railway, according to an article that Disney wrote years later for Railroad Magazine.

Van Noy Railway Hotel and News began a series of mergers and acquisitions in 1914, starting with the Brown News Company (also headquartered in Kansas City) which was acquired on October 1, 1914. In 1915, the company began consolidating operations with the New York City-based Interstate News Company. The company name was changed to Van Noy Interstate News Company in 1917, but the company headquarters remained in Kansas City under the leadership of Ira C. Van Noy.

In 1922, the company owned distribution avenues covering of railroad, and had accumulated a massive portfolio of concession stands, stores, restaurants, and hotels. However, the need for railroad news services and en route eating houses was declining as railroads added dining cars to more trains. In early 1923, Missouri Pacific Railroad ended their long standing affiliation with Van Noy Interstate, although Van Noy continued to operate hotels at some smaller terminals where train crews ended their runs.

==Evolution away from Railway Service==
As a result of changes in railroad passenger train service, Van Noy Interstate began to focus more on the hotel side of their operations. In 1922, the Company acquired the Gem Fountain Company, and in 1926 the company began operating as the Interstate Company. The Interstate Company operated restaurants in train stations, as well as lunch rooms in bus stations. One of the more famous hotels owned by the company was the Beverly Hills Hotel, owned and operated by Interstate between 1928 and 1932. The Van Noy family&#x27;s involvement in the Company ended following the death of the last surviving Van Noy Brother, Henry Clay Van Noy.

Horizons were broadened in 1954, when the Interstate Company was awarded its first airport contract at the San Francisco International Airport. Numerous name changes and corporate consolidations took place as the surviving company moved further from its roots as a railroad news service, although the company remained in the core business of providing services to travelers. By the time that the Interstate Company became Interstate HOSTS in 1959, all railroad station restaurant operations had ended. In 1968, the name was again changed to Host International, and this company was then acquired by the Marriott Corporation in 1982 and was then renamed to Host Marriott Corporation.

On March 22, 2002, Autogrill S.p.A. purchased the Host Marriott Services division from the Marriott Corporation. Through this acquisition, Autogrill gained contracts in 18 of the 20 largest United States airports as well as franchises such as Pizza Hut, Burger King, Sbarro, and Starbucks. Increased revenue from these acquisitions allowed Autogrill to expand heavily into Europe’s successful railway systems – the original transportation mode embraced by the Van Noy Railway News Company. Autogrill renamed the company HMSHost, which is largely the corporate successor to the 1897 Van Noy operation and continues to provide products, services, and entertainment to customers on the go. The hotel and resorts assets of the original Van Noy operation was spun off from Marriott as the Host Marriott Corporation in 1996. Today, the company is called Host Hotels and Resorts and is a Real estate investment trust, employing some 229 employees.

<text>The colors of postage stamps are at once obvious, and among the most difficult areas of philately. Different denominations of stamps have been printed in different colors since the very beginning; as with their successors, postal clerks could distinguish the Penny Black and Two pence blue more quickly by color than by reading the value, and the practice generally continues today. In practice, the actual color of a stamp may vary, and while collectors will pay high prices for rare shades, it may not be easy to tell those apart from variations caused by age, light, chemicals, and other factors. Stamp colors are routinely described by color name rather with any sort of a numerical system like CMYK; several color guides showing a selection of colors have been produced, but are not especially popular with collectors.

Nearly all stamps get their color from inks printed on white or light-colored paper; the handful of exceptions include early issues of Natal consisting only of embossing on colored paper, some recent stamps embossed on gold foil or with foil blocking to achieve a metallic appearance, and the Uganda Cowries produced on a typewriter. A number of early stamps were printed in black on differently-colored papers; the most famous example is the British Guiana 1c magenta.

== History ==
Initially, countries typically made a random choice of colors for denominations. In 1896, the members of the Universal Postal Union agreed on green, red, and blue as the standard colors for standard printed matter, postcard, and letter rates, respectively, when sent abroad. This convention was gradually abandoned as inflation created too many exceptions from the 1930s and onwards.

Stamps with two colors (&quot;bi-colored&quot;) began to appear very early, although typically reserved for higher values, due to the added expense of multiple print runs. Multicolored stamps appeared along with the development of color printing techniques; they now account for the majority of modern stamps, although single-color designs are still common, more so for some countries than others.

== Shades and color changes ==

Color shades have several different causes. The printer may use a different ink; in the early days, inks were made up in batches as needed, and were rarely consistent. In such cases, the shade provides information about when the stamp was made, and possibly even identify a particular printing. Extreme variations may be considered color errors; for instance, the 4c value of the US Columbian Issue of 1893 was normally printed in ultramarine, but a handful were printed in blue, a shade with distinctly more green; these are worth in the US$10,000 range instead of the usual $10.

Inks may also be diluted or applied more thinly, as for instance the World War I stamps of Germany and World War II stamps of the United Kingdom. It can also happen randomly, if a printing plate is accidentally under-inked.

Ultraviolet light is destructive to a great many pigments, and can cause considerable lightening. In addition, some countries have used water-soluble materials known as fugitive inks to prevent postage stamp reuse. Stamps of this type may be much lighter in color after being soaked.

Some dramatic color variations occur as a result of chemical action; such stamps are called color changelings. Examples include sulfuretting (often misnamed &quot;oxidation&quot;), a reaction involving lead that may turn a blue or green stamp to black, and the effects of salt water, famously seen in stamps of New South Wales recovered from the wreck of the &quot;Colombo&quot;. Forgers have also used chemicals to try to produce seeming rarities, although by now experts know how to identify these attempts.

== Nomenclature ==
In general, collectors follow the stamp catalogs in matters of color nomenclature, even though the different catalogs are not consistent with each other. Although there are a great many named colors, the selection used by philatelists is limited to several dozen, modified by adjectives such as &quot;dark&quot;, &quot;light&quot;, &quot;pale&quot;, &quot;bright&quot; and &quot;deep&quot;. In addition, two color names may be combined, as in &quot;gray green&quot; or &quot;brown orange&quot;, where the first name indicates the direction of modification to the second color. Thus &quot;brown orange&quot; is a duller and darker orange, while &quot;orange brown&quot; has a tinge to it that is more orange than would be seen with a &quot;yellow brown&quot; or &quot;red brown&quot;. This system becomes less clear when extended to other colors, and few collectors could describe precisely how &quot;carmine rose&quot; is different from &quot;rose carmine&quot;. Certain colors such as &quot;lake&quot;, a shade of red which often commands a price premium, have a traditional, but somewhat uncertain, meaning which differs from general usage of &quot;lake&quot; in terms of pigments and dyes.

Originally, government-issued official descriptions merely gave out a primary name such as &quot;red&quot; for a whole range of shades. In more recent years, the descriptions have become more precise, such as &quot;dark sage green&quot;, though not necessarily enlightening collectors any more than previously.

<text>The XPW European Championship is a former professional wrestling title defended in Xtreme Pro Wrestling (XPW) and the Frontier Wrestling Alliance (FWA).

The championship was created in 2003 through a working relationship between XPW and the FWA. This was to be the flagship of the working relationship as the title would be defended throughout Europe and would appear on both promotions respective television programmes, however the title&#x27;s primary home was to be the FWA. Though it was defended in the FWA, the belt itself was never actually seen, due to XPW folding shortly after the tournament final that determined the first champion and keeping the physical championship belt in the United States. Jonny Storm, the winner of the tournament, continued to defend the championship which was supposedly in the briefcase he carried with him around the world until January 2005 when Storm officially vacated and retired the title.

==First champion==
1. Zebra Kid, Robbie Brookside, Jonny Storm and Juventuded Guerrera wrestled representing FWA. Psicosis, Simon Diamond, Jerry Lynn and Chris Hamrick wrestled representing XPW.
2. The match ended in a Double Red Card as both men failed to return to the ring before a 20 count.

<text>Forty Licks is a double compilation album by the Rolling Stones. A 40-year career-spanning retrospective, &quot;Forty Licks&quot; is notable for being the first retrospective to combine their formative Decca/London era of the 1960s, now licensed by ABKCO Records (on disc one), with their self-owned post-1970 material, distributed at the time by Virgin/EMI but now distributed by ABKCO&#x27;s own distributor Universal Music Group (on mostly disc two). Four new songs are included on the second disc. The album was a commercial success, as it reached No. 2 on both UK and US charts. Concurrently with the album&#x27;s release, the Stones embarked on the successful, year-long international Licks Tour, which would result in the subsequent &quot;Live Licks&quot; album being released in 2004.

==Background==

In 1970, the Rolling Stones had an acrimonious break-up with their former manager, Allen Klein, and their former record label, Decca Records (who licensed their recordings to London Records for release in the US). Because of the terms of their former contract, all of their pre-1970 recordings were under Klein&#x27;s control, up to and including &quot;Let It Bleed&quot;, some tracks that made it on &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; and &quot;Exile on Main Street&quot;, as well as outtakes, unreleased recordings, and live recordings. The Stones would immediately form Rolling Stones Records as a result, that gave them control over all of their subsequent recordings. As a result, any career retrospectives tended to be divided into two eras: prior to the split, and after the split. Klein&#x27;s ABKCO Records and Decca Records would continue to release unauthorized greatest-hits records, outtakes and rarities records, and other compilations throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Any compilations or retrospectives released by the Rolling Stones after 1970, by any of their distributors or partners (such as Atlantic Records or Virgin Records) were always restricted to material recorded and released from 1971 onward. Because of various business deals and mergers of various record companies over time, the barriers to creating a unified retrospective compilation album had been resolved by the early 2000s.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Forty Licks&quot; has received mostly positive reviews from music critics. AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine felt that &quot;Forty Licks&quot; was similar to &quot;ELV1S: 30 #1 Hits&quot; because both were influenced by The Beatles&#x27; &quot;1&quot;, but that &quot;Forty Licks&quot; had a better concept than &quot;ELV1S&quot;. Although Rob Brunner&#x27;s review of the album for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; was favorable, he felt that the album was not needed because most of the band&#x27;s fans already own all of the notable songs on the album. Darryl Sterdan of Jam! CANOE also felt that most fans already owned most of the songs on the album and that &quot;Losing My Touch&quot; was the only good previously unreleased song on the collection. Rob Sheffield of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; felt that there were several songs missing from the album, but that the compilation was exciting and the four new songs were much better than their other recent work. &quot;Stylus&quot; magazine&#x27;s Colin McElligatt felt that the band needed an &quot;all-inclusive&quot; collection, but the collection will not please everyone.

<text>The Honda Shadow refers to a family of cruiser-type motorcycles made by Honda since 1983. The Shadow line features motorcycles with a liquid-cooled 45 or 52-degree V-twin engine ranging from 125 to 1,100 cc engine displacement. The 250 cc Honda Rebel is associated with the Shadow line in certain markets.

==History==
In 1983, Honda introduced the VT500c and VT750c Shadow series of motorcycles to enter the American cruiser market. However, due to tariff restrictions in the United States on imported Japanese bikes over 701 cc, the VT750c was reduced to 700 cc and sold as the Vt700c from 1984. The tariff was lifted in 1985 and the line soon expanded to an 1,100 cc bike the VT1100c. The VT750c was replaced by an 800 cc version the VT800c in 1988.

The VT600c was launched in 1988 as Honda&#x27;s new entry level Shadow though still slotted above the Honda Rebel. The line changed little until the introduction of the 750 cc Honda Shadow Ace in 1997. From 2000 to 2007, the Honda Shadow Sabre replaced the VT1100 until the 1,100 cc class was discontinued in favor of the new VTX line, specifically the 1,300 cc offering known as the VTX1300. As of 2011, the Shadow brand has been limited to a single 750 cc cruiser available in Spirit, Aero, Phantom, and RS trims. All other offers are known under the VTX or Rebel brands.

The RS and Phantom are the 2 latest additions to the 750 cc line-up from year 2010. Both are Fuel injected. Shadow RS recalls a flat track racing bike with chain drive, a &#x27;peanut&#x27; style gas tank and a slightly higher seat height ( 29 inches ) with foot pegs less forward than conventional cruisers ( meaning a more standard seating position). Phantom is more like a conventional cruiser in ergonomics.

==Models==

===125 cc Class===

The Honda 125 is mainly for the UK and Europe market, as it fits within the restrictions placed on learner drivers in the UK and the light motorcycle license in Europe. It also has a chain drive instead of a shaft drive seen on the larger engined bikes. Sales ended in 2009.

===500 cc VT Class===
The 500cc &quot;VT500C&quot; introduced in 1983 featured chrome side covers and black engine covers. The headlight was chrome and rectangular and had a single horn. The engine was the Honda VT500, a OHC three-valve, liquid cooled V-Twin that averaged around 51.7MPG and put out 54HP@9,000RPM and 31 ft-Ib of torque @7,000RPM and mated to a six-speed, shaft drive transmission.

In 1984, The &quot;VT500C&#x27; was featured include the fuel tank and rear fenders painted the same. The front fender is chrome and this year the side covers and engine covers were painted black. The headlight was chrome and rectangular and there was a single horn. The engine is virtually the same as the 1983 model.

The 1985 &quot;VT500C&quot; had round and chromed headlamps. This model continued with the dual horns. A two piece seat with an integrated backrest was incorporated. Starting this year, the engine covers were polished chrome and the fins enlarged. The &quot;Honda&quot; tank decal was curved instead of straight.

For the 1986 model year, the &quot;VT500C&quot; model was virtually the same as the 1985 model.

===600 cc VT Class===

The &quot;VLX&quot; &quot;Shadow 600&quot; (aka &quot;VT600C&quot;) was introduced as a new model in 1988. It has a single shock rear suspension, a low seat height and a long wheelbase with a fuel tank. The engine is a SOHC three-valve liquid cooled 52-degree V-Twin that averaged 49.5MPG and unlike prior models this engine utilized a shared crankpin to have a more Harley Davidson-like sound &amp; shake thus generating a low 39HP @6,500rpm and 36 ft-Ib of torque @3,500RPM connected to a four-speed transmission and chain drive. In 1999 the dual Keihin CV carburetors were replaced by a single vertical Keihin CV carburetor more like the single carbs found on Harley Davidsons via different heads and a special intake manifold again like many Harley Davidsons, this further reduced horsepower from 39 hp down to 35 hp.

All years of the VT600C wheels are spoked.

In 1989, The VLX VT600C remained largely the same. The VT600C was not made in 1990 but did make a comeback in 1991 offered only in black. The engine and body style was retained from the 1991 model year.

A new deluxe version &quot;VT600CD&quot; introduced in 1993 added more chrome on the engine cases and valve covers. The seat on the deluxe version is soft and tucked. By 1994 the Deluxe model was a standard offering for every year the VLX was made.

===700-800 cc VT class===
A 1983 model year 750cc V-twin motorcycle is the senior member in the large family of Honda cruisers (of various sizes) named &quot;Shadow&quot;. As of 2018 the once-extensive Shadow line has been reduced to two successors of that original model, the &quot;Shadow Aero 750&quot; and the &quot;Shadow Phantom 750&quot;. Even after multiple engine redesigns the current Shadow 750 still uses the same general layout as the 1983 motor: 4-stroke liquid-cooled narrow-angle V-twin, SOHC three-valve cylinder heads with dual spark plugs.

====VT750C 45° V-twin====
The VT750C &quot;Shadow debuted in late 1982 for North American markets, and a nearly identical NV750 &quot;Custom launched in Japan for Honda&#x27;s domestic market. Both were propelled by a new 750 cc liquid-cooled four-stroke dual-carburetor SOHC three-valve 45-degree V-twin engine with a six-speed transmission and shaft final drive. The Honda identification code for this type of engine is RC14E.

In a January 1983 road test, &quot;Cycle&quot; said: &quot;This 750 twin is built around what is arguably the most technologically sophisticated Vee ever designed.&quot; Advanced technology included three-valve two-plug combustion chambers and a vibration-canceling offset dual-pin crankshaft, as well as hydraulic valve adjusters to keep the valvetrain running at effectively zero-clearance while also eliminating routine adjustments. Each cylinder head had a single chain-driven camshaft and an individual downdraft CV carburetor. Engineering innovations appeared in the transmission as well. The clutch was actuated hydraulically rather than through a mechanical cable; a diaphragm clutch spring was used instead of more common coil springs and a slipper clutch eliminated rear-wheel hop during engine braking or quick downshifting.

In addition to the V-engine, the Shadow&#x27;s frame and body incorporated classic American cruiser styling cues: a teardrop fuel tank (with a hidden sub-tank to increase capacity), a low height two-piece seat with sissy bar and backrest, cruiser handlebar, cast wheels, chrome front fender, a round head lamp and instrument casings, large rake angle and angle-cut mufflers. In the US market 1983 was the only model year for the VT750C Shadow, which was available in two colors, Black and Candy Wineberry Red. The VT750C remained available in Canada for the 1984 and 1985 model years nearly unchanged, apart from color, from the 1983 model.

For the 1986 model year, Japan&#x27;s NV750C was renamed &quot;Honda Shadow&quot; as part of appearance and frame updates, including a lower seat, longer wheelbase, increased rake and trail as well as a rod linkage for the rear brake (previously cable operated). Cast wheels were changed from ten spokes to five. Gold color was added to wheels, crankcase cover and headlight trim. The NV750C Shadow continued to use the RC14E motor. Canadian VT750C models for 1986 were updated in the same manner as the NV750C. The Shadow 750 was exported to Germany in 1987, the last VT750C model year.

=====VT700C=====
The VT700C &quot;Shadow&quot; is among a class of motorcycles (including 700cc Honda Sabre and Magna models) known as &quot;tariff-busters.&quot; Honda introduced the Shadow 700cc model in 1984 exclusively for the US market in response to tariffs (to protect Harley-Davidson) on Japanese motorcycles with engines over 700cc. Honda took the RC14E 45-degree V-twin and reduced its bore size by to create the smaller displacement RC19E engine which was not subject to the import tariff.

The VT700C for 1984 was available in either Black or Candy Scorpio Red; for 1985 the color choices were Black or Candy Glory Red. Both years had painted side covers with a &quot;Shadow 700&quot; decal.

For 1986 Honda altered the frame and appearance of the VT700C (as with the Canadian and Japanese 750 models) which included lowering the seat, stretching the wheelbase, increasing rake and trail, switching the front brake from dual disks to a single disk and replacing ten-spoke with five-spoke cast wheels. The new frame was designed to suppress engine vibrations, and a new camshaft improved low-rpm performance with a slight reduction in peak power. The engine was no longer painted black, the front fender was painted instead of chrome plated, and side covers were chrome instead of paint. Side covers displayed the single word &quot;Shadow&quot; and Honda&#x27;s wing logotype was showcased on the tank. The passenger backrest was eliminated. Color schemes for 1986 were either Black or Candy Brilliant Red and then Black or Candy Glory for 1987, last model year for the VT700C.

=====VT800C=====

Honda introduced the VT800C &quot;Shadow&quot; for 1988, the sixth year of the Shadow series. The 800cc engine had the same bore diameter as the original Shadow 750 engine, and a longer stroke, but was otherwise the same SOHC, three valves per cylinder, 45-degree V-twin engine. Besides having a larger displacement, this new RC32E engine did have another significant difference – it had a four-speed transmission. The VT800c ran on spoke-and-rim wheels that required tube-type tires instead of the tubeless tires used on the earlier models with cast wheels.

The 1988 Shadow 800 had a new look, with more chrome plating along with two-toned paint on the fuel tank and fenders. Color combinations were Black and Candy Glory Red, or Candy Wineberry Red and Dry Silver Metallic. The tank also wore a simple &quot;Shadow&quot; decal, rather than the Honda wing. The VT800C was produced only for the North American market, and only for the 1988 model year.

====VT750C 52° V-twin, chain drive====

Honda brought out a new engine for the VT750C &quot;Shadow ACE&quot; in 1997 (the ACE or A.C.E. designation, for &quot;American Classic Edition&quot;, was used only in North America). The RC44E engine had its origin in the 600cc Shadow VLX 52-degree V-twin, enlarged to 750cc by means of a wider bore and a longer stroke. This new engine was similar to the old (RC14E) Shadow 750 in that it had liquid cooling and SOHC three-valve dual-plug combustion chambers, conversely, it lacked hydraulically adjusted valves, offset crankpins and a slipper clutch. The shared crankpin limited these engines to 43 hp @ 5500rpm and 44ftlb @ 3000rpm. Further changes to the drivetrain included a wide-ratio five-speed gearbox (down from six) and a chain final drive instead of shaft. Engine intake was through dual CV carburetors, with Secondary air injection on the exhaust side for emissions control.

The VT750C Shadow ACE had full fenders and retro style features similar to the VT1100C Shadow ACE released two years earlier. A chrome plated exhaust had the look of a two-into-one system, but each header pipe had separate channel inside the large muffler, exiting through two tailpipes. North American models had an electronic speedometer and idiot lights mounted on the handlebar, while models for the European and other market had them mounted on the fuel tank. The Shadow 750 was available as a standard or Deluxe model with more chrome (VT750CD) and optional two-tone paint. The 750cc Shadow was also available in Japan as the NV750C (and as a nearly identical Shadow 400cc model) continuing through 2001. The NV750C was also available in South Korea from 1999 to 2001.

1998 through 2000 models of the VT750C continued with annual color changes. From 2001, North American models had the speedometer mounted on the tank (the same as European and Australian versions). The 750cc Shadow ACE was the best-selling model in Honda&#x27;s 2002 street motorcycle lineup. For 2002 and 2003, rather than the standard VT750C standard model, Honda manufactured only VT750CD (Deluxe) or VT750DC (Spirit) models.

=====VT750DC=====
For the 2001 model year, Honda added a slightly modified version of the VT750C to the Shadow line, the VT750DC &quot;Shadow Spirit (North American models, Shadow Black Widow in Europe) with lower gearing and street-rod or chopper style bodywork. The VT750DC Shadow was exported to Australia, and Honda&#x27;s domestic market version was the NV750DC &quot;Shadow Slasher.

Although the frame and body were new, VT750DC and NV750DC models used the existing RC44E motor with dual CV carburetors. Distinguishing features were a narrower front tire on a 19-inch wheel, slim front fender and a bobbed rear fender. Honda manufactured the VT750DC Shadow Spirit through the 2003 model year, skipped 2004, then resumed production in 2005‑2007 for North America. The last model year for the VT750DC overlapped with its shaft-drive replacement, the 2007 VT750C2 Shadow Spirit.

=====VT750RS=====
Honda announced in 2009 that they would produce a roadster version of the Shadow 750 with chain final drive. Honda Motor Co. originally designed the VT750S, powered by the RC58E fuel-injected 52° V-twin, for their domestic market. Nonetheless, the made-in-Japan VT750S was exported to Europe as well as Australia and New Zealand.

At the request of American Honda, this new model was also exported to North America as the VT750RS (&quot;Retro Standard&quot;). With the arrival of the VT750RS in 2010, there were four concurrent models in the Shadow 750 lineup: the fuel-injected RS and Phantom, in addition to the carbureted (in North America) Spirit and Aero. Honda kept the Shadow RS on the roster for four model years, from 2010 to 2013 inclusive.

With frame geometry that differed significantly from Shadow cruisers, the VT750S and RS models&#x27; footpegs, handlebars and seat put the rider into a neutral, upright posture. The seat height of , for example, was higher than most cruisers and a full above that of the Shadow Phantom. Rake and trail were 32.5 degrees and , 1.5 degrees steeper and approximately less than other Shadows. The VT750RS wheelbase of was about shorter.

The VT750RS had spoked wheels with tube-type tires, 100/90-19 in front and 150/80-16-inch in back. Brakes were a single 296 mm front disc with a twin-piston caliper and a mechanical drum rear.

Several reviewers observed that there was more than a passing resemblance between the VT750RS and Sportster 883 models; Honda&#x27;s peanut-shaped fuel tank, for instance, emulated classic Sportster tanks. A few road tests included side-by-side comparisons of the Honda and the Harley-Davidson.

For the 2011 model year, the VT750RS was painted in Honda Racing tricolors, evocative of the Honda VFR750R.

====VT750C 52° V-twin, shaft drive====

At the 2003 Tokyo Motor Show, Honda exhibited a preproduction &quot;low-and-long&quot; 750cc Shadow kitted out in retro-style bodywork, equipped with shaft final drive and the Honda Ignition Security System (HISS) electronic anti-theft device.

Honda dropped the &quot;ACE&quot; and &quot;Spirit&quot; models from the 750cc Shadow line for 2004, manufacturing just the new VT750C &quot;Shadow Aero&quot; model (chain-drive Spirit production restarted in 2005). The reengineered RC50E engine was still a 52-degree, liquid-cooled V-Twin, single-pin crankshaft configuration. SOHC cylinder heads still had two spark plugs and three valves, but were modified to increase the compression ratio. Engine tuning changes de emphasized peak power in favor of torque at low and mid RPMs. A 2‑into‑1 exhaust ended in a large muffler containing separate silencers for each cylinder (similar to that on the 750 ACE) as well as a catalytic converter. The dual CV carburetors of the RC44E motor were replaced by a single CV carburetor on the RC50E. A new steel-tube frame with lower frame rails moved the Aero&#x27;s seat height further down than either of the models it replaced.

Honda replaced the 2‑into‑1 exhaust with a 2‑into‑2 system for 2008 and subsequent model years, including the 2008‑2009 Shadow Tourer VT750T model equipped with a windscreen, saddlebags and passenger backrest. Except for North America, 2008 VT750C models had programmed fuel injection (PGM-FI) in place of the CV carburetor. Shadow Aero models were given PGM-FI in North America starting with the 2011 model year.

Honda offers anti-lock brake options for the 750cc Shadow Aero. Early VT750CA models had front-wheel ABS only, subsequent VT750CS models replace the rear drum brake with a hydraulic disk brake, required for Honda&#x27;s combined ABS (C-ABS) with individual control of front and rear brakes. Shadow Aero VT750C and VT750CS models remain in the American Honda line-up for 2019.

=====VT750C2=====
In 2007 (the twenty-fifth year of the Shadow line) Honda sold three different Shadow 750 cruisers, the original chain-drive &quot;Spirit&quot;, the shaft-drive &quot;Aero&quot; and the first &quot;Spirit &quot;VT750C2. Canadian automotive journalist David Booth said &quot;that the VT750C2 is essentially the mechanicals of the VT750C Aero mated to the styling of the VT750D Spirit, with a few essential tweaks.&quot; The C2 model inherited its 750cc engine from the Aero, with a CV carburetor for North America and a PGM-FI throttle body elsewhere.

The VT750C2 Spirit came by its frame layout from the VT750C Aero as well, but Honda&#x27;s designers adjusted the new Spirit&#x27;s geometry to give it a drag-bike or chopper-style appearance. A wheelbase stretched to , a rake angle of 34°30&#x27; along with noticeable triple-tree offset gave prominence to bare forks and a 21-inch front wheel (a first for Honda cruisers). The chopper look was reinforced by a two-into-two exhaust system and a seat height reduced to .

There were two significant updates to the VT750C2 Spirit. From 2012, North American Spirit models eliminated the carburetor in favor of a PGM-FI throttle body. From 2013, a new Spirit VT750C2S model with antilock front and rear disc brakes (C-ABS) was sold alongside the VT750C2 in the US and was the only model offered in Europe.

Confusingly, the model code VT750C2 had already been used to identify 1997-2001 European and Australian 750 Shadows with two-tone paint.

=====VT750C2B=====
The 2010 VT750C2B &quot;Shadow Phantom debuted in Fall 2009 powered by a blackened fuel-injected version (engine code RC53E) of the existing Shadow 750 shaft-drive engine. The Phantom&#x27;s frame and abridged bodywork, based on the Aero 750, were both painted black. This model was called the Shadow Black Spirit in European markets. Honda Motor Europe described the VT750C2B, called Shadow Black Spirit&quot; in some European markets, a variant of the VT750C2 Shadow Spirit with &quot;authentic bobber styling.&quot;

In North America, the 2010 model year marked the arrival of PGM-FI equipped Shadow 750 engines, in both Phantom and VT750RS models.

The VT750C2B Shadow Phantom remains in the American Honda line-up for 2019.

====VT750C recall====
Honda and NHTSA issued a January 2016 recall for 2010 through 2016 VT750C/CA/CS, VT750C2/ C2F/C2S, and VT750C2B models. The NHTSA announcement said that “engine vibration may cause the bank angle sensor wire to rub on the wire harness joint connector, resulting in a loss of the sensor signal.” Honda Motor Company had received reports, dating back to 2013, of engine stall or misfire incidents resulting from bank angle sensor failure.

====VT400 replica====
Honda Japan created a series of VT400 models for the Japanese domestic market in 1997, practically identical to the VT750 series but with smaller displacement engines. Among these was the Shadow Slasher, introduced in February 2000. From 2009, Honda Australia imports the VT400 as a Learner Approved Motorcycle alongside the popular VT750.

===1,100 cc VT Class===
The V-Twin 1100 (VT1100) was introduced by Honda in 1985 and was in continuous production till 2007.&lt;br&gt;
All models used an 1099cc displacement engine, the Honda VT1100 engine with minimal mechanical changes during its production.
====1985-1986====
The VT1100C (Sc18?) model was introduced in 1985 as a larger model from the 750/800 cc models. The 1985–86 models are recognizable by the dual horns below the headlight, square turn signals, dual front disk brakes, and one exhaust pipe on each side (front cylinder on right side, rear cylinder on left). There are dual gauges on the bars for speedometer and tachometer, and fuel and temperature gauges that on the fuel tank. The engine is a SOHC liquid cooled V-twin with a five-speed transmission and shaft drive. the 1985 and 1986 engines were higher performance engines vs later models, having a longer stroke and smaller piston compared to 1987 and later models, allowing this first generation motor to make approximately 76 horsepower.

====1987-1996====

The 1987 VT1100C model took on a brand-new look with a lower seat (), a longer wheelbase , a fuel tank, an extended front fork , and weighs a hefty . Both exhaust pipes were now run along the right side of the bike, with the horns being relocated to the sides of the engine. The engine, while the same 1099 cc displacement as the previous model, is rated for approximately 63 horsepower due to shorter stroke and larger pistons. It also now had a four-speed transmission with a hydraulically actuated clutch. The &quot;VT1100C&quot; model was not manufactured in 1991 (to sell off excess stock of 1990 models), but returned in 1992 with a &quot;Made in the USA&quot; stamp on the seat.&lt;br&gt;
Some sites will list this model as the &quot;VT1100 Standard&quot; or &quot;1100 Shadow Standard&quot;, but this was never an official name. &lt;br&gt;
This styling continued virtually unchanged through 1996.

====1995====
In 1995, the V-Twin market really got going, and manufacturers expanded their offerings with variants of their standing models. &lt;br&gt;The American Classic Edition (A.C.E.) (VT1100C2) was introduced this year as an additional model to the still available VT1100C. It featured a more retro styling than the VT1100C, with a full rear fender, induced vibrations, and a &#x27;Harley-Davidson-like&#x27; sound from a single pin crank engine. The model lost about 10 hp, but gained a new 5 speed transmission.

====1997-2007====
1997 saw the Standard replaced with the Spirit with more chrome on the engine but the same basic engine as the standard. This model also has a 5 speed transmission and a cable actuated clutch. There were slight frame and body work changes with this model versus the previous model as well. Horns were moved to the front of the bike and the front exhaust now follows the frame instead of cutting across the engine.

An ACE Tourer was also introduced based on the 1100 Spirit engine but the ACE styling. The ACE Tourer came with a two-into-one-into-two exhaust system, a counterbalanced with a dual crank pin crankshaft, and hard, color-matched saddlebags. The last of the 6,000+ Tourer models was produced in January 2001.

====1998-2003====
In 1998, 1100cc Honda rolled out the VT1100C3 Aero, based on the VT1100C2 ACE engine with the single pin crank, but a larger two into one exhaust and more retro styling. The 1100 Aero was discontinued after the 2003 model year.

====2000-2007====
The Honda Shadow Sabre model was introduced, based on the Honda VT1100 engine with different styling than the still manufactured Spirit model. The most notable feature was the front cast aluminum wheel. This model also had a slightly lower rear gear ratio in the transmission allowing the bike to have better off the line acceleration than the regular Spirit model; however this also caused higher engine RPM at highway speeds. &lt;br&gt;
Due to lower sales and the availability of the VTX1300, 2007 was the final year Honda made the VT1100 Shadow.

<text>René Anis Moawad (; 17 April 1925 – 22 November 1989) was a Lebanese politician who served as the 9th president of Lebanon for seventeen days, from 5 to 22 November 1989, before his assassination by unknown assailants.

==Early life and education==
Mouawad was born in 1925 to parents Anis Moawad and Evelyn Shalhoub. He was educated at De La Salle School in Tripoli, before pursuing his secondary education at Collège Saint Joseph – Antoura des Pères Lazaristes. He went to Saint Joseph University in Beirut and graduated with a law degree in 1947. He subsequently joined the law firm of Abdallah El-Yafi, a former prime minister; before opening his own law firm in Tripoli in 1951.

==Parliamentary career==
Moawad made his first foray into politics in 1951, when he unsuccessfully contested a Zgharta seat in the National Assembly. Although he was defeated, the election forged a crucial alliance between him and the Frangieh clan. He was subsequently elected to the National Assembly in 1957, and reelected in 1960, 1964, 1968, and 1972, the last parliamentary election held before his election to the presidency (the civil war that raged from 1975 to 1990 prevented further elections from being held in the meantime).

In 1952, Moawad was briefly arrested and detained in Aley for participating in the national uprising that forced the resignation of President Bechara El Khoury, Lebanon&#x27;s first post-independence leader. He also fell out with Khoury&#x27;s successor, Camille Chamoun, when the latter hinted at a possible constitutional change to extend his six-year term which was due to expire in 1958. He went into exile in Latakia, Syria. It was during his exile that he won his first election to the National Assembly.

Moawad became a strong supporter of Chamoun&#x27;s successor, Fuad Chehab. He chaired the Parliamentary Law Committee and the Finance and Budget Committee. He served as Minister of Posts and Telecommunications in the government of Prime Minister Rashid Karami (also a Chehabist) from 31 October 1961 to 20 February 1964. He later served as Minister of Public Works, again under Karami, from 16 January to 24 November 1969, during the presidency of Chehab&#x27;s successor, Charles Helou. In 1970, he supported Chehabist presidential candidate and old friend Elias Sarkis against his old ally Suleiman Frangieh. Frangieh won the election by a single vote.

On 25 October 1980, Moawad returned to the Cabinet as Minister of National Education and Fine Arts, in the government of President Elias Sarkis (who had succeeded Frangieh in 1976) and Prime Minister Shafik Wazzan, a position he held until the expiry of Sarkis&#x27;s term on 24 September 1982. The strength of his alliance with Suleiman Frangieh was severely tested in that year, when Moawad voted to support Bachir Gemayel, Frangieh&#x27;s rival, for the presidency. Despite Frangieh&#x27;s anger, their friendship was so deep that it survived the test.

==Election and assassination==
Following the Taif Agreement to end the civil war, the National Assembly met on 5 November 1989 at the Qoleiat air base in North Lebanon and elected Moawad as President of Lebanon. The post had been vacant since the expiration of Amine Gemayel&#x27;s term in 1988. The National Assembly had failed to elect a successor at that time. Seventeen days after being elected, as he was returning from Lebanon&#x27;s Independence Day celebrations on November 22, 1989, a 250 kg car bomb was detonated next to Moawad&#x27;s motorcade in West Beirut, killing him and 23 others. Chawki Choweiri, Lebanon&#x27;s UN representative, said &quot;This is the major catastrophe of the years of catastrophes we have had so far. We may have lost one of the last opportunities to unite the nation.&quot;

To this day, the identity and motives of those responsible remain a matter of debate. Returning from the Cedar Revolution protest against the Syrian occupation on 14 March 2005, Nayla Moawad declared, &quot;The independence of Lebanon was regained on March 14, and on March 14 I felt that I avenged (my husband&#x27;s) assassination.&quot;

==Personal life and legacy==
A Maronite Christian noted for his moderate views, Moawad had given some citizens hope that the long civil war in Lebanon could be ended. He was an example of non-violence and accommodating and accepting others in the Arab world, his culture of non-confrontation, troubleshooting conflict and his courage led all of the Lebanese parties to accept him as a president to end the war. Before he died, Moawad had addressed the nation with these words: &quot;There can be no country or dignity without unity of the people, and there can be no unity without agreement, and there can be no agreement without conciliation, and there can be no conciliation without forgiveness and compromise.&quot; He was succeeded by Elias Hrawi.

As the son of Anis Bey Mouawad, who had been mayor of the municipality, and his wife Evelyn Shalhoub, Moawad was the scion of a prominent Zgharta family, but he was the first member of the family to represent the constituency in Parliament.

In 1965, Moawad married Nayla Moawad, a relative of Moawad&#x27;s old political opponent Bechara El Khoury. Despite the historical animosity between their two families, as well as the fact that she was fifteen years his junior, the marriage was evidently a happy one. Their daughter Rima Moawad is now a lawyer and a graduate of Harvard University in the United States, while their son Michel Moawad is a lawyer and businessman who graduated from Sorbonne University in Paris.

Moawad&#x27;s widow Nayla founded the René Moawad Foundation, to further the goals of dialogue, peace, and social justice, to which he had dedicated his life. Nayla Moawad was elected to the National Assembly in 1991. She was a member of the opposition Qornet Shehwan Gathering, which opposed the Syrian military presence in Lebanon. In 2004 she announced her candidacy for the Presidency to succeed Émile Lahoud, whose term legally ended in November.

Moawad&#x27;s son, Michel, founded a new political party in 2006 called Independence Movement. The movement is part of the anti-Syrian Qornet Shehwan Gathering and the March 14 Alliance. In 2005–2009 it had 3 Maronite Christian MPs for the Zgharta District in the Lebanese Parliament, Nayla Moawad, Jawad Simon Boulos and Samir Frangieh. Since 2009, the party has been led by Michel Moawad, Jawad Simon Boulos and Youssef Bahaa El Douaihy.

==Memorials==

Originally called the Hamidi Public Garden and for decades referred to by the public as the Sanayeh Garden, The René Moawad Garden was constructed in the first decade of the 20th century. It was renamed in honor of President René Moawad following his assassination near the garden.

<doc id="902522" wikidata="Q5470256" url="?curid=902522" title="Forms of cricket">
<text>Cricket is a multi-faceted sport with different formats, depending on the standard of play, the desired level of formality, and the time available. One of the main differences is between matches limited by time in which the teams have two innings apiece, and those limited by number of overs in which they have a single innings each. The former, known as first-class cricket if played at the senior level, has a scheduled duration of three to five days (there have been examples of &quot;timeless&quot; matches too); the latter, known as limited overs cricket because each team bowls a limit of typically 50 overs, has a planned duration of one day only. A separate form of limited overs is Twenty20, originally designed so that the whole game could be played in a single evening (3 hours), in which each team has an innings limited to twenty overs.

Double innings matches usually have at least six hours of playing time each day, with formal intervals on each day for lunch and tea, and additional brief informal breaks for drinks. There is also a short interval between innings. Limited overs matches often last at least six hours, with similar intervals and breaks, whilst the more streamlined Twenty20 matches are generally completed in under four hours. T10 cricket is a newer version of the game, based on the principles of other limited overs formats, but with only 10 overs per innings, and the total playing time limited to 90 minutes.

Local club cricket teams, which consist of amateur players, rarely play matches that last longer than a single day; these may loosely be divided into 
* declaration matches, in which a specified maximum time or number of overs is assigned to the game in total and the teams swap roles only when the batting team is either completely dismissed or declares
* limited overs matches, in which a specified maximum number of overs is assigned for each team&#x27;s innings individually. These will vary in length between 30 and 60 overs per side at the weekend and the 20-over format in the evenings.

Indoor cricket is a variant of the sport played in sports halls during the winter months.

At still lower levels, the rules are often changed simply to make the game playable with limited resources, or to render it more convenient and enjoyable for the participants. Informal variants of the sport can be played almost anywhere, if there is enough space.

==Professional cricket==
Four forms of cricket have been played at what may be termed the highest international or domestic level of the game. Three are contested currently and one is historic. There is no official term for this level of cricket &quot;collectively&quot;, although the individual forms do have official designations and are defined by the International Cricket Council (ICC). In the past, before any official definition was agreed upon, highest standard matches were routinely described as &quot;great&quot; or &quot;important&quot; or &quot;top-class&quot;; or even &quot;first-class&quot; before this became the official term for one type of cricket (see below). Note that &quot;minor cricket&quot; is a term used officially in England and Wales at least.

Matches played at the highest international and domestic levels are those in which players and/or teams of a recognized high standard are taking part. In modern domestic cricket, it includes first-class cricket, List A cricket and top-class Twenty20 competitions for both men and women. Test cricket, One Day Internationals (ODIs) and Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is) are variations of those forms within the international sphere. Historically (see History of cricket), top-class matches were those held by substantial sources to have &quot;historical significance&quot; including single wicket and those double innings matches without statistical significance: i.e., lacking scorecards and other statistical data.

The oldest known English county teams are Kent, Surrey and Sussex, all of which have histories commencing in the early 18th century. These counties had achieved a high standard long before their modern county clubs were founded (from 1839 to 1845), and so they have always had first-class status. Following a meeting in May 1894 of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and the County Championship clubs, the concept of &quot;first-class cricket&quot; was officially defined. By 1895, several other counties had also been recognized as having first-class status, as had MCC itself from its foundation in 1787. Top-class limited overs cricket began in 1963 when the County Championship clubs took part in the first seasonal knockout tournament, which was won by Sussex. Hence, like all the other first-class counties, Sussex for example is classified as a List A team from 1963; and as a top-class Twenty20 team since 2003.

===First-class matches===

First-class cricket is a form of the game in which teams of a recognized high standard compete. Test cricket is first-class at international level; the term &quot;first-class&quot; is habitually applied to domestic matches only, although a player&#x27;s Test statistics are included in their overall first-class statistics. A first-class match must have eleven players per side, two innings apiece and a scheduled duration of at least three days. Historically, however, there have been instances of first-class matches being arranged for less than three days, and there have been others with twelve or thirteen players per side; these are exceptional cases and form a tiny percentage of the whole. If the game is not completed within the allotted time then it is drawn, regardless of who has scored the most runs when time expires. Limited overs matches in which the teams have only one innings each are not first-class (see List A and Twenty20 sections below) and these cannot result in a draw (they can, however, result in a tie or be declared a &quot;no result&quot;).

Test matches, other games between two Test nations, games between two domestic teams deemed first-class in countries holding full membership of the ICC, and games between a Test nation&#x27;s national side (or a team drawn from a national touring squad) and a first-class domestic team from a Test nation, are deemed to be first-class. A match between a leading ICC associate member and another team adjudged first-class would be granted first-class status, but domestic matches in the associate member country are minor.

The origin of the term &quot;first-class cricket&quot; is unknown but, along with other terms, it was used loosely for top-class eleven-a-side matches before it acquired its official status in 1894 (see above). Subsequently, at a meeting of the Imperial Cricket Conference (ICC) in May 1947, it was formally defined on a global basis. A key omission of both the MCC and ICC rulings was any attempt to define first-class cricket retrospectively and it was stipulated in the ICC ruling that the definition &quot;will not have retrospective effect&quot;. Many historians and statisticians have subjectively classified chosen pre-1895 matches as first-class but these are &quot;unofficial&quot; ratings and differences of opinion among the experts has led to variations in published cricket statistics. The main problem with &quot;first-class cricket&quot; is that it can be a misleading concept as it is essentially statistical and may typically ignore the historical aspect of a match if statistical information is missing, as is invariably the case with matches played up to 1825. Nevertheless, the recognition of any match as first-class by a substantial source qualifies it as such and it follows that the teams, venues and players involved in such matches before 1895 are the equivalent of first-class teams, venues and players since 1895. Substantial sources interested in 18th and 19th century cricket include Arthur Haygarth, F. S. Ashley-Cooper, H. T. Waghorn, G. B. Buckley, H. S. Altham, Roy Webber, John Arlott, Bill Frindall, the ACS and various internet sites (see Historical sources). Writing in 1951, Roy Webber drew a line between what is important historically and what should form part of the statistical record when he argued that the majority of matches prior to 1864 (i.e., the year in which overarm bowling was legalized) &quot;cannot be regarded as (statistically) first-class&quot; and their records are used &quot;for their historical associations&quot;.

===Limited overs cricket===

Limited overs cricket played with 40 to 60 overs per team, known statistically as List A cricket, is the second form of cricket which differs from first-class as the teams play one inning each and are allowed a maximum number of overs per innings. Matches are scheduled for completion in a single day&#x27;s play, though they can in theory continue into a second day if impacted by bad weather. Most cricketing nations have some form of domestic List A competition. The over limits range from forty to sixty. The categorization of &quot;List A&quot; was only endorsed by the ICC in 2006; the Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians created it for the purpose of providing a parallel to first-class cricket in their record books.

====100-ball cricket====
100-ball cricket is a form of cricket in which each team has an innings of at most 100 legal balls. Ties are, in some cases, broken by having each team play a &quot;Super Five&quot;, which is a 5-ball innings for each team. Subsequent Super Fives may be played if the first Super Five is tied. This format is played professionally in The Hundred competition, which started in 2021 in England and Wales.

====Double wicket====
Double-wicket or &quot;pairs&quot; cricket is a form of cricket with two teams of two players each which are pitched against each other for a limited number of overs. A player getting out in this form of cricket does not retire but continues to bat but is penalized a stipulated number of runs for each time he gets out. There have been a number of international double wicket cricket tournaments, between 1978 and 2001.

====One-vs-One Cricket====
A very similar format was used in the &quot;Ultimate Kricket Challenge&quot;, held from 24 December 2020 to 1 January 2021 in Dubai. It was a one-on-one format, with players taking turns bowling 15 ball innings to each other. It was played indoors, and the bowling player was assisted by a wicketkeeper and one fielder, as well as being allowed a substitute bowler for up to 7 balls per innings.

====T10 cricket====
T10 format is a limited-overs evolution of cricket, following the success of the T20 game, with play limited to just 10 overs per team. It was first played from 14 to 17 December 2017 at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium, approved by the Emirates Cricket Board in a professional cricket league owned and launched by T10 Sports Management. Each team has one inning of 10 overs, also time-limited to 90 minutes. The league is played in a round-robin format that is followed by the semifinals and the final. If there is a tie, the result is decided by means of a Super Over. In August 2018, the International Cricket Council (ICC) officially sanctioned the second season of T10 to be held in Sharjah starting on 23 November that year, with six teams competing.

====Twenty20 cricket====

Twenty20 is a separate form of limited-overs cricket and is not part of List A. It is the third form of cricket originally devised in England in 2003. The teams have one inning each in which the maximum number of overs is twenty. Twenty20 competitions are held internationally and there are domestic championships, sometimes called &quot;franchise cricket&quot; in several cricketing nations.

===Single wicket===

A match in which, as the name implies, there is a single batsman at any time. It is probably the oldest form of cricket as, at its most basic level, it involves one player against another. Historically, its matches were top-class and it has known periods of huge popularity, especially in the mid-18th century when it was the most popular form of cricket thanks to its gambling associations, and in the first half of the 19th century. Matches can involve teams with a single player only but the lucrative 18th century games were mostly between teams of three to five players known as &quot;threes&quot;, &quot;fours&quot; or &quot;fives&quot;. Only those players designated as team members can bat or bowl but it is normal to have the full quota of fielders including a wicket-keeper.

===Three team cricket===
Three team cricket, branded as 3TeamCricket (3TC), is an experimental format that was devised by Paul Harris, former CEO of FirstRand Bank. A 3TC match is contested between 3 teams of 8 players each. Teams bat for one innings of 12 overs, split between two 6-over periods, facing one opponent in the first half and the other opponent in the second half.

On 18 July 2020, the 3TC Solidarity Cup became the first 3TeamCricket match to be played. It was held in South Africa as a charity exhibition match.

==Amateur cricket==
===Club cricket===
Club cricket, by far and away the widest form of cricket played worldwide, is largely amateur, but still formal, cricket, with the teams organised into leagues. The games are sometimes limited-overs, with each innings usually lasting between twenty and fifty overs. Other matches are played to time restrictions. Restrictions in overs or time may be placed on each side individually, or they may stipulate the total length of the match. The latter more traditional case is often known as &quot;declaration&quot; cricket.

Club cricket is played extensively in cricketing nations, and also by immigrants from cricketing nations. Club cricket most often takes place on a natural grass wicket, often maintained by the players themselves, although at a lower level it may take place on an artificial turf pitch, though the rest of actual field will be natural grass.

There are numerous forms of cricket which, although they are not played professionally or at a recognized high standard, are still popular as common formats of amateur cricket. The double innings, limited overs, Twenty20 and single wicket forms are played by amateur teams: for example, Grade cricket in Australia and the Minor Counties Cricket Championship in England and Wales play the double innings form.

===Declaration cricket===
This is the most traditional version of cricket, with rules most closely replicating the original rules of cricket from the 16th and 17th century. It is a single innings game with a set time limit for the entire game to be completed in. To win the game, a side must both score the highest aggregate number of runs and take all ten of the opposition wickets. It is up to the side batting first to declare when they feel they have enough runs to be able to win the match. In this format of cricket, if the side batting second do not lose all ten of their wickets, the match is said to have ended in a draw.

Declaration cricket is generally played over a single day, although two day games lasting an entire weekend are also common. This format is often seen as &quot;old-fashioned&quot; and is typically used for friendly matches rather than in organised league play.

===Short format cricket===

Cricket is also played in several different shortened forms, designed to pack as much action as possible into an hour or two, enabling them to be played as a single contest in an evening, or as a series of multiple contests between different teams that cover the entire day. Such forms have evolved since the 1980s, and take cricket an additional step beyond one-day cricket. Most forms will resemble twenty-twenty cricket in nature, although shorter formats with reduced numbers of players, typically 6-aside or 8-aside, are also common for tournament play.

====Rules====
Different forms of short format cricket have different rules for certain situations:

* When all but one of a team&#x27;s batsmen are out:
** In Last man stands cricket, the last batsman who is not out bats alone, can only run even numbers of runs, and can only make their ground at the striker&#x27;s end.
** In six-a-side cricket, the last batsman to be out acts as the nonstriker, while only the not-out batsman can take strike.

===Blind cricket===

Blind cricket is a variant for blind and partially sighted players. The most obvious difference is that the ball contains ball bearings so that it can be heard, and that it is rolled along the ground. Blind cricket was invented in 1922, and has been governed by the World Blind Cricket Council since 1996.

===Indoor cricket===

Indoor cricket is a format of the game designed to be played in an indoor sports hall at times of the year when outdoor play is not possible. There are two recognized forms of indoor cricket. The traditional version played with a hard ball is popular in the UK. This format is played with six players per side and features modified rules designed specifically for indoor play. A soft ball version is played by junior cricketers in the UK and is also popular among adults in the Southern Hemisphere.

===Kwik cricket===

It is a simplified, high-speed version of the game played on a small pitch with plastic equipment, aimed mainly at encouraging youngsters to take part.

===Table cricket===

Table Cricket is an indoor version of the game designed primarily for physically challenged cricketers.

=== Walking cricket ===
Walking cricket is a form of cricket for senior players where players are required to not run during the game. Batters who get out are allowed to keep batting, but the bowling team gains five runs per dismissal.

==Informal forms of cricket==
===Backyard cricket===
Backyard cricket, Beach cricket, Street cricket and Garden cricket are all different names used to describe a wide range of related informal games. The rules are often &quot;ad hoc&quot;, and the laws of cricket, such as those involving leg before wicket, penalty runs, and others, are ignored or modified to suit both the setting and participants&#x27; preferences. In India and Pakistan, there is &quot;Gali&quot; cricket (&#x27;gali&#x27; in Hindi means &#x27;street&#x27;. It is pronounced as &#x27;gully&#x27; but should not be confused with the fielding position). Often, there are no teams, and each player plays for himself, and fields when he is not batting. Often, there is one wicket, and one bowling position, and no overs. If the batsman runs a single run, he is allowed to walk back to the wicket before the next ball is bowled. 

Informal cricket in the UK is often known as garden cricket and is played in gardens and recreation grounds around the country. Because of limited space in gardens and the potential damage to property, one particular version of garden cricket is unique in that there are no concept of runs as aerial attacking shots are expressly forbidden, and instead, the winning batsman is the one who can survive the longest number of deliveries. Typically this will be played with a tennis ball or other soft bouncy ball, and modified rules, such as &quot;one hand one bounce&quot; are often employed. The length of the wicket will typically be roughly 15 meters, and the non-bowling fielders will be encircled close round the bat looking for a catching chance. There are quite often other rules such as &quot;not out the first ball&quot; and &quot;not out leg before wicket&quot;.

Plaquita and bete-ombro are examples of Latin American versions of street cricket.

===French cricket===

It is a game in which the ball is bowled at the legs of the batsman, with the batsman&#x27;s legs forming the wicket. It is often played by children. A tennis ball is often used rather than the harder cricket ball. Much like beach cricket, the rules may vary wildly.

===Non-stop (continuous) cricket===
Continuous cricket is a game involving one batsman, who upon hitting the ball, must run to a marker, which is square of the wicket. The bowler may bowl as soon as the ball is returned, regardless of whether or not the batsman is still running. The game can be played in teams, or as a group, where players rotate between fielding positions, batting and bowling.

===Tape ball cricket===

Tape ball cricket was invented in Karachi, Pakistan as an attempt to replicate the feeling of a standard game. It does so by covering a tennis ball with electrical tape to make it heavier and give it a smoother surface, similar to that of a hard cricket ball, which also creates extra swing in the air. This concept has the added advantage of not requiring any protective gear, which has seen it spread a sometimes exclusive sport to people from all walks of life. Since its inception in the 1960s-70s, it has been enjoyed in several countries and Pakistanis who have settled abroad have introduced the idea to others by founding tape ball leagues in the UK, USA, and Canada. It remains the most popular pastime for many in Pakistan and was named as one of cricket&#x27;s ten greatest inventions by Wisden in 2020.

===Tennis ball cricket===

This type of cricket is popular in the South Asian sub-continent, USA and Canada. In this game a harder version of tennis ball is used. The number of overs in the game varies from 6 to 25 overs. Considering that the ball is not as hard as the professional cricket ball, the use of protective gear like gloves, pads and helmets is optional. As tennis ball cricket games are shorter when compared to the conventional version, it suits the US and Canadian lifestyle where one would see a large number of people participating. Where cricket pitches are not available, part of a baseball diamond is used as a pitch in most parts of USA and Canada.

==Unorthodox forms of cricket==

=== Ball in Play ===
Ball in Play (BiP) is an indoor form of cricket which includes elements of baseball. It was started by Jomboy Media in collaboration with Major League Cricket in order to help American baseball fans learn cricket.

===Kilikiti===

Also known as Kirikiti, or Samoan Cricket, it is the national game of Samoa and is especially popular in New Zealand. The game is descended from the cricket brought to Samoa by British missionaries; teams of unlimited size follow rules opaque to outside observers in a game/dance/feast event that can last several days.

===Leg cricket===

Similar to kickball, it is a form of cricket which involves kicking the ball instead of hitting with a bat.

===Trobriand cricket===

It is a peculiar form of cricket played in the Trobriand Islands, in Papua New Guinea. Although cricket was introduced by the British as part of colonial agenda, it was adopted into local Trobriand culture and many modifications and cultural adaptations were made over the years. Some of these include: under-arm bowling; outs are celebrated with dances; the &quot;home&quot; team (the tribal community which organised a match) always wins; any number of players can take part in a match; players dress in traditional war costumes.

===Vigoro===

It is a form of cricket that also resembles baseball, mainly played by women.

==Cricket simulations without a ball or pitch==
===Book cricket===
Book cricket is played by school children in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. It has several variants and is usually played by 2 teams consisting of 3-4 players each. If there are an odd number of players then the person who is left at the end of distribution of teams can play for both teams and is often called a common player. The runs are scored by flipping a book open at random and counting as the number of runs scored the last digit of the page-number of the verso (the left-side or even-numbered page). 0 and sometimes 8 are assigned special rules: typically a wicket is lost when a person scores 0, and a No-ball run and an additional chance are assigned when a player scores 8. To give an example, if the batting side opened the book at page 26, then 6 runs would be scored. For the toss, both players open a page and the one who scores the higher number of runs wins.

Another version of cricket appeared during the 1950s in the UK in the &quot;Eagle&quot; comic. A page was chosen and each letter or symbol was counted according to a formula. This produced a scorecard with the majority of innings around 150 to 300 scored at about 4 runs per over.

===Calculator cricket===
This form is played by school children who use scientific calculators for maths and science.

A player starts by clearing the memory on their calculator. The player will then use the random number generator on their calculator to bring up a number between 0 and 1. The number of runs scored is the first digit after the decimal point (for example, if the random number generator provides 0.521, 5 runs are scored). Scoring is kept by using the memory addition function on the calculator, or by pen and paper. Scoring a 0 is considered out. The player who has the highest score wins.

===Hand cricket===
Hand cricket is played through gestures (called &#x27;throws&#x27;) similar to rock paper scissors. The total number of fingers extended equates to the equivalent number, with a thumb counting as 6. In some variants, this is the maximum number of runs possible in a throw, but in others, it extends to 10 runs, with 7 indicated by the thumb and index finger, 8 by the thumb, index and middle finger, 9 by the thumb, index, middle, and ring fingers, and 10 by a scrunched up (as opposed to an open) palm. Throws are made simultaneously by both players, one designated as the batter and the other as the bowler. Runs scored according to the batter&#x27;s throws until the bowler throws the same, in which case the batter is &quot;out&quot;. It is played by school children in India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan.

===Pencil cricket===

A one-person game played with pencils marked by hand to function as &#x27;long dice&#x27;. A Japanese variant of these for use in other games are called &#x27;battle pencils&#x27;. It may also simply be played with conventional dice. The aim is to generate scores and attribute them to imaginary players and teams by compiling a scorecard. The game has been marketed commercially featuring plastic or metal long dice (rollers) and playing rules.

The board game Test Match operates on a similar principle.

===Pub cricket===

Also called car cricket. A travel game based on the names of public houses passed on the route. Runs are scored according to the number of legs, arms or other items featured in the pub name. The exact rules vary according to the participants.

<text>The McNamara Alumni Center at the University of Minnesota&#x27;s Twin Cities campus in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Designed by Antoine Predock, it is one of the more architecturally striking buildings in the Twin Cities. The building, opened in 2000, contains two main components: University office space and 10 meeting rooms for University and public use. The University owns the land, but the University of Minnesota Gateway Corporation, consisting of the U of M Foundation and U of M Alumni Association, owns the structure.

== Overview ==

Located at the intersection of University Avenue and Oak Street SE (200 SE Oak St, Minneapolis, MN 55414), the landmark building occupies land formerly home to Memorial Stadium and its interior features an arch that was once an entrance to the stadium. The building opened in February 2000 and is named for Richard McNamara, a 1956 alumnus of the university and former Gopher football player.

Architect Antoine Predock was chosen in 1996 to design the structure. KKE Architects of Minneapolis served as the project&#x27;s executive architect and general manager. About of copper clads the rectangular portion where university offices are located, including those of the University of Minnesota Alumni Association. Granite supported by 500 steel beams forms an asymmetrical geode-styled area of the building featuring an interior public Memorial Hall, tall. Some 2,200 rose-colored granite blocks weighing up to each form the geode&#x27;s exterior. The structure required of granite.

With ten versatile rooms, all on the first floor, the center is a popular Minneapolis conference, gala and wedding reception venue. In 2015 more than 750 meetings and events were held here. Voted Best Meeting Venue by Minnesota Meetings &amp; Events magazine 2007 to 2012, McNamara has many conveniences, including tunnel connections to an adjacent 500-car parking ramp and hotel, quick highway access and award-winning D’Amico Catering onsite.

The rental demand for special event spaces at the center and growth in operations of the University of Minnesota Foundation and the University of Minnesota Alumni Association, both housed in the center, prompted the University of Minnesota Board of Regents to approve a $9.7 million expansion. The addition, designed by Predock, included office and event space as well as an expanded restaurant. Construction began in 2009 to coincide with the opening of the adjacent Huntington Bank Stadium with funding provided by the ownership consortium. The addition was completed in 2010 and created an additional of space allowing for improved traffic flow in the building and reducing foot traffic through events, specifically in Memorial Hall.

<doc id="902524" wikidata="Q5868155" url="?curid=902524" title="History of circumcision">
<text>Circumcision likely has ancient roots among several ethnic groups in sub-equatorial Africa, Egypt, and Arabia, though the specific form and extent of circumcision has varied. Ritual male circumcision is known to have been practiced by South Sea Islanders, Aboriginal peoples of Australia, Sumatrans, and some Ancient Egyptians.

Today it is still practiced by Jews, Samaritans, Druze, Coptic Christians, Ethiopian Orthodox, Eritrean Orthodox, Muslims, and some tribes in East and Southern Africa; as well as in the United States, South Korea, and the Philippines.

As practiced in ancient Egypt and elsewhere in Africa, only part of the foreskin was removed. However, in Judaism and in the United States, the foreskin is completely removed.
Circumcision and/or subincision, often as part of an intricate coming of age ritual, was a common practice among the Aboriginal peoples of Australia and most Pacific islanders at first contact with Western travellers. It is still practiced in the traditional way by some of the population.

Herodotus, writing in the 5th century BCE, lists first of all the Egyptians being the oldest people practicing circumcision then Colchians, Ethiopians, Phoenicians, and Syrians as circumcising cultures.

==Purpose==
The purpose of circumcision has been variously proposed that it began:
* as a religious sacrifice;
* as a rite of passage marking a boy&#x27;s entrance into adulthood;
* as a form of sympathetic magic to ensure virility or fertility;
* as an aid to hygiene where regular bathing was impractical;
* as a means of marking those of higher social status;
* as a means of humiliating enemies and slaves by symbolic castration;
* as a means of differentiating a circumcising group from their non-circumcising neighbors;
* as a means of discouraging masturbation or other socially proscribed sexual behaviors;
* as a means of increasing a man&#x27;s attractiveness to women;
* as a demonstration of one&#x27;s ability to endure pain;
* as a male counterpart to menstruation or the breaking of the hymen;
* to copy the rare natural occurrence of a missing foreskin of an important leader;
* as a way to repel demonesses; and/or
* as a display of disgust of the smegma produced by the foreskin.
Removing the foreskin can prevent or treat a medical condition known as phimosis. It has been suggested that the custom of circumcision gave advantages to tribes that practiced it and thus led to its spread.

Darby describes these theories as &quot;conflicting&quot;, and states that &quot;the only point of agreement among proponents of the various theories is that promoting good health had nothing to do with it.&quot; Freud believed that circumcision allows senior men to constrain the incestuous desires of their juniors, and mediates the tension inherent in the father-son relationship and generational succession. Youth are symbolically castrated, or feminized, but also blessed with masculine fruitfulness.

Circumcision may have been practiced among Homo sapiens prior to the Out of Africa migration. As late as 45,000 BCE, modern humans migrated into Australia. Based on iconographic evidence of Australian Aboriginal peoples from the Paleolithic era, circumcision may have been practiced as early as the Paleolithic by these groups.

==Ancient world==
===Ancient Africa===
====North Africa====
At Oued Djerat, in Algeria, engraved rock art with masked bowmen, which feature male circumcision and may be a scene involving ritual, have been dated to earlier than 6000 BP amid the Bubaline Period; more specifically, while possibly dating much earlier than 10,000 BP, rock art walls from the Bubaline Period have been dated between 9200 BP and 5500 BP. The cultural practice of circumcision may have spread from the Central Sahara, toward the south in Sub-Saharan Africa and toward the east in the region of the Nile.

====West Africa====
The Nomoli figurines, which were created by the Mende people in Sierra Leone and depict male circumcised genitalia, have been dated between the 7th century CE and the 8th century CE.

====Central and East Africa====
Prior to 300 CE, male circumcision, which is a cultural practice that is part of male initiations, is estimated to have existed in Africa for more than 9000 years. By 300 CE, male initiation and male circumcision had ceased among matrilineal Bantu-speaking peoples in East Africa and Central Africa.

Agatharchides of Cnidus (2nd century BCE) indicated that &quot;troglodyte&quot; ethnic groups practiced circumcision; these groups may have resided along the African coast of the Red Sea in southern Egypt or near the Gulf of Zula in present-day Eritrea; while most of these groups practiced a form of circumcision that involved partial excision, the ethnic group, identified by Agatharchides as the &quot;Colobi&quot; (&quot;the mutilated&quot;), were indicated to have practiced a form of circumcision that involved total excision.

Herodotus (5th century BCE) indicated that ancient Ethiopians practiced circumcision.

====Southern Africa====
In the 19th century CE, Shaka, a Zulu king, prohibited male circumcision due to concerns that young circumcised men might be less interested in joining as warriors in the military force he was amassing and uniting in the region of southern Africa and might be more interested in seeking opportunities for having sex.

===Egypt===

According to studies, the Egyptian rite performed at the age of puberty, did not involve the amputation of an annular piece of the foreskin as in the modern Jewish rite of brit milah. Instead, it would have involved excising a triangular section, or alternately just creating a longitudinal incision, in the dorsal face of the foreskin. In modern terms, this is preputioplasty and/or dorsal slit (superincision). This is supported by artworks and statues showing foreskins, some of which present an incision on the glans, not an annular circumcision.

There is also limited evidence of some individuals with circumcision. The rite may then have changed to circumcision by the time of Herodotus&#x27; visit to Egypt.

The rite was performed by priests in a public ceremony using a stone blade. It is thought to have been more popular among the upper echelons of the society, although it was not universal and those lower down the social order are known to have had the procedure done. On the other hand, medical historian Frederick Hodges argues there is evidence against the purported prevalence of circumcision in Egypt, proposing it was limited to priests, functionaries and some workers.

Based on engraved evidence found on walls and evidence from mummies, the rite has been dated to at least as early as 6000 BCE in ancient Egypt. Ancient Egyptian mummies, which have been dated as early as 4000 BCE, show evidence of having undergone the rite.

At the mastaba of Ankhmahor in Saqqara, an engraved wall provides an account of Uha, dated to the 23rd century BCE, which indicates that he and others underwent the rite.

Sixth Dynasty (2345–2181 BCE) tomb artwork in Egypt has been thought to be the oldest documentary evidence of the rite, the most ancient depiction being a bas-relief from the necropolis at Saqqara (c. 2400 BCE). In the oldest written account, by an Egyptian named Uha, in the 23rd century BCE, he describes a mass rite and boasts of his ability to stoically endure the pain: &quot;When I was [circumcised], together with one hundred and twenty men ... there was none thereof who hit out, there was none thereof who was hit, and there was none thereof who scratched and there was none thereof who was scratched.&quot;

The Egyptian hieroglyph for &quot;penis&quot; (𓂸 D52) depicts either an erect organ, which may or may not be circumcised in representation.

Herodotus, writing in the 5th century BCE, wrote that the Egyptians did not find the outcome to be aesthetically pleasing but that they &quot;practise circumcision for the sake of cleanliness, considering it better to be cleanly than comely.&quot;

David Gollaher claimed the rite in ancient Egypt to be a mark of passage from childhood to adulthood. He mentions that the alteration of the body and ritual were supposed to give access to ancient mysteries reserved solely for the initiated (See also Clement of Alexandria, Stromateis 1.15). The content of those mysteries are unclear but are likely to be myths, prayers, and incantations central to Egyptian religion. The Egyptian &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;, for example, tells of the sun god Ra cutting himself, the blood creating two minor guardian deities. The Egyptologist Emmanuel vicomte de Rougé interpreted this as an act of circumcision.

Strabo and Philo of Alexandria indicated that the ancient Egyptians practiced circumcision. Clement of Alexandria relates that Pythagoras was circumcised by Egyptian priests, as was Thales of Miletus. In the Egyptian Tale of Two Brothers a scene is depicted with one brother appearing to circumcise himself.

Diodorus Siculus and Xanthus of Lydia indicated that female circumcision was also a common custom in ancient Egypt. A papyrus, which was part of the Serapeum&#x27;s Ptolemaios archive at Memphis and has been dated to 163 BCE, indicated that an ancient Egyptian girl, Tathemis, was scheduled to undergo it.

===Semitic peoples===
Circumcision was also adopted by some Semitic peoples living in or around Egypt. Herodotus reported that circumcision is only practiced by the Egyptians, Colchians, Ethiopians, Phoenicians, the &#x27;Syrians of Canaan&#x27;, and &quot;the Syrians who dwell about the rivers Thermodon and Parthenius, as well as their neighbours the Macronians and Macrones&quot;. Sanchuniathon, a purportedly ancient Phoenician writer recorded by Philo of Byblos, tells the origin of circumcision as part of a myth, according to which the god Kronos circumcised himself and his allies to atone for his castration of his father Ouranos. Herodotus also reports, however, that &quot;the Phoenicians, when they come to have commerce with the Greeks, cease to follow the Egyptians in this custom, and allow their children to remain uncircumcised.&quot;

Archaeological or further literary records do not support that circumcision was truly widespread among Semites. In the case of the Phoenicians, it has been proposed that Herodotus and successors like Aristophanes might have mistaken Jews for them, as Biblical sources describe Phoenicians and other peoples like the Philistines as uncircumcised. Roman authors do not mention circumcision in Carthage or other Phoenician settlements in Africa, even although it would have added to the colourful Punic stereotype entertained in Roman literature. Other authors believe Phoenicians abandoned the practice at some point, although it might have not fully died out, as proved by Philo&#x27;s record.

Josephus seems to suggest that the Edomites were uncircumcised until being forcefully converted to Judaism by John Hyrcanus. It has been also interpreted, however, that up to that point they actually practiced a different kind of genital cutting such as preputioplasty or superincision (dorsal slit) that was later replaced by circumcision.

===Judaic culture===

According to Genesis, God told Abraham to circumcise himself, his household and his slaves as an everlasting covenant in their flesh, see also Abrahamic Covenant. Those who were not circumcised were to be &quot;cut off&quot; from their people. Covenants in biblical times were often sealed by severing an animal, with the implication that the party who breaks the covenant will suffer a similar fate. In Hebrew, &quot;kārat berît&quot; meaning to seal a covenant translates literally as &quot;cut a covenant&quot;. It is presumed by Jewish scholars that the removal of the foreskin symbolically represents such a sealing of the covenant. Moses might not have been circumcised; one of his sons was not, nor were some of his followers while traveling through the desert. Moses&#x27;s wife Zipporah circumcised their son when God threatened to kill Moses.

===Hellenistic world===
According to Hodges, ancient Greek aesthetics of the human form considered circumcision a mutilation of a previously perfectly shaped organ. Greek artwork of the period portrayed penises as covered by the foreskin (sometimes in exquisite detail), except in the portrayal of satyrs, lechers, and barbarians. Negative evaluations of the aesthetic outcome of the procedure may have led to a decline in the incidence of circumcision among many peoples that had previously practiced it throughout Hellenistic times.

In Egypt, only the priestly caste retained circumcision, and by the 2nd century, the only circumcising groups in the Roman Empire were Jews, Samaritans, Jewish Christians, Egyptian priests, and the Nabatean Arabs. Circumcision was sufficiently rare among non-Jews that being circumcised was considered conclusive evidence of Judaism (or Early Christianity and others derogatorily called Judaizers) in Roman courts—Suetonius in &quot;Domitian 12.2&quot; described a court proceeding (from &quot;my youth&quot;) in which a ninety-year-old man was stripped naked before the court to determine whether he was evading the head tax placed on Jews and Judaizers.

Cultural pressures to circumcise operated throughout the Hellenistic world: when the Judean king John Hyrcanus conquered the Idumeans, he forced them to become circumcised and convert to Judaism, but their ancestors the Edomites had practiced circumcision in pre-Hellenistic times.

Some Jews tried to hide their circumcision status, as told in 1 Maccabees. This was mainly for social and economic benefits and also so that they could exercise in gymnasiums and compete in sporting events. Techniques for restoring the appearance of an uncircumcised penis were known by the 2nd century BCE. In one such technique, a copper weight (called the &quot;Judeum pondum&quot;) was hung from the remnants of the circumcised foreskin until, in time, they became sufficiently stretched to cover the glans. The 1st-century writer Aulus Cornelius Celsus described two surgical techniques for foreskin restoration in his medical treatise &quot;De Medicina&quot;. In one of these, the skin of the penile shaft was loosened by cutting in around the base of the glans. The skin was then stretched over the glans and allowed to heal, giving the appearance of an uncircumcised penis. This was possible because the Abrahamic covenant of circumcision defined in the Bible was a relatively minor circumcision; named &quot;milah&quot;, this involved cutting off the foreskin that extended beyond the glans. Jewish religious writers denounced such practices as abrogating the covenant of Abraham in &quot;1 Maccabees&quot; and the Talmud. During the 2nd century, the procedure of circumcision changed in order to become irreversible.

Later during the Talmudic period (500–625 CE) a third step, known as &quot;Metzitzah&quot;, began to be practiced. In this step the &quot;mohel&quot; would suck the blood from the circumcision wound with his mouth to remove what was believed to be bad excess blood. As it actually increases the likelihood of infections such as tuberculosis and venereal diseases, modern day mohels use a glass tube placed over the infant&#x27;s penis for suction of the blood. In many Jewish ritual circumcisions this step of Metzitzah has been eliminated.

First Maccabees tells us that the Seleucids forbade the practice of &quot;brit milah&quot;, and punished those who performed it – as well as the infants who underwent it – with death.

The 1st-century Jewish author Philo Judaeus (20 BCE – 50 CE) defended Jewish circumcision on several grounds, including health, cleanliness and fertility. He also thought that circumcision should be done as early as possible as it would not be as likely to be done by someone&#x27;s own free will. He claimed that the foreskin prevented semen from reaching the vagina and so should be done as a way to increase the nation&#x27;s population. He also noted that circumcision should be performed as an effective means to reduce sexual pleasure: &quot;The legislators thought good to dock the organ which ministers to such intercourse thus making circumcision the symbol of excision of excessive and superfluous pleasure.&quot; There was also division in Pharisaic Judaism between Hillel the Elder and Shammai on the issue of circumcision of proselytes.

Flavius Josephus in Jewish Antiquities book 20, chapter 2 records the story of King Izates who having been persuaded by a Jewish merchant named Ananias to embrace the Jewish religion, decided to get circumcised so as to follow Jewish law. Despite being reticent for fear of reprisals from his non-Jewish subjects he was eventually persuaded to do it by a Galileean Jew named Eleazar on the grounds that it was one thing to read the Law and another thing to practice it. Despite his mother Helen and Ananias&#x27;s fear of the consequences, Josephus said that God looked after Izates and his reign was peaceful and blessed.

===Medieval Judaism===
The Jewish philosopher Maimonides (1135–1204) insisted that faith should be the only reason for circumcision. He recognised that it was &quot;a very hard thing&quot; to have done to oneself but that it was done to &quot;quell all the impulses of matter&quot; and &quot;perfect what is defective morally.&quot; Sages at the time had recognised that the foreskin heightened sexual pleasure. Maimonides reasoned that the bleeding and loss of protective covering rendered the penis weakened and in so doing had the effect of reducing a man&#x27;s lustful thoughts and making sex less pleasurable. He also warned that it is &quot;hard for a woman with whom an uncircumcised man has had sexual intercourse to separate from him.&quot;

A 13th-century French disciple of Maimonides, Isaac ben Yediah, claimed that circumcision was an effective way of reducing a woman&#x27;s sexual desire. With a non-circumcised man, he said, she always orgasms first and so his sexual appetite is never fulfilled, but with a circumcised man she receives no pleasure and hardly ever orgasms &quot;because of the great heat and fire burning in her.&quot;

===Decline in Christianity===
The Council of Jerusalem in Acts of the Apostles 15 addressed the issue of whether circumcision was required of new converts to Christianity. Both Simon Peter and James the Just spoke against requiring circumcision in Gentile converts and the Council ruled that circumcision was not necessary. However, Acts 16 and many references in the Letters of Paul show that the practice was not immediately eliminated. Paul of Tarsus, who was said to be directly responsible for one man&#x27;s circumcision in Acts 16:1–3 and who appeared to praise Jewish circumcision in Romans 3:2, said that circumcision didn&#x27;t matter in 1 Corinthians 7:19 and then increasingly turned against the practice, accusing those who promoted circumcision of wanting to make a good showing in the flesh and boasting or glorying in the flesh in Galatians 6:11–13. In a later letter, Philippians 3:2, he is reported as warning Christians to beware the &quot;mutilation&quot;. Circumcision was so closely associated with Jewish men that Jewish Christians were referred to as &quot;those of the circumcision&quot; (e.g. Colossians 3:20) or conversely Christians who were circumcised were referred to as Jewish Christians or Judaizers. These terms (circumcised/uncircumcised) are generally interpreted to mean Jews and Greeks, who were predominant; however, it is an oversimplification as 1st-century Iudaea Province also had some Jews who no longer circumcised and some Greeks (called Proselytes or Judaizers) who did, (along with a few Nabataean Arabs Judaized by Hasmoneans, Ethiopians, and the rare Egyptian priest). According to the Gospel of Thomas saying 53, Jesus says:
:&quot;His disciples said to him, &quot;is circumcision useful or not?&quot; He said to them, &quot;If it were useful, their father would produce children already circumcised from their mother. Rather, the true circumcision in spirit has become profitable in every respect.&quot;&quot; SV

Parallels to Thomas 53 are found in Paul&#x27;s Romans 2:29, Philippians 3:3, 1 Corinthians 7:19, Galatians 6:15, Colossians 2:11–12.

In John&#x27;s Gospel 7:23 Jesus is reported as giving this response to those who criticized him for healing on the Sabbath:
:Now if a man can be circumcised on the sabbath so that the Law of Moses is not broken, why are you angry with me for making a man whole and complete on a sabbath? ( Jerusalem Bible)

This passage has been seen as a comment on the Rabbinic belief that circumcision heals the penis (Jerusalem Bible, note to John 7:23) or as a criticism of circumcision.

Europeans, with the exception of the Jews, did not practice circumcision. A rare exception occurred in Visigothic Spain, where during the armed campaign king Wamba ordered circumcision of everyone who committed atrocities against the civilian population. The practice, on the other hand, is customary among the Coptic, Ethiopian, and Eritrean Orthodox Churches, and also some other African churches.

As part of an attempted reconciliation of Coptic and Catholic practices, the Catholic Church condemned the observance of circumcision as a moral sin and ordered against its practice in the Council of Basel-Florence in 1442. According to UNAIDS, the papal bull of Union with The Copts issued during that council stated that circumcision was merely unnecessary for Christians; El-Hout and Khauli, however, regard it as condemnation of the procedure. The Catholic Church currently maintains a neutral position on the practice of non-religious circumcision, as the church has a policy of inculturation.

In the 18th century, Edward Gibbon referred to circumcision as a &quot;singular mutilation&quot; practised only by Jews and Turks and as &quot;a painful and often dangerous rite&quot; ... (R. Darby)

In 1753 in London there was a proposal for Jewish emancipation. It was furiously opposed by the pamphleteers of the time, who spread the fear that Jewish emancipation meant universal circumcision. Men were urged to protect:

:&quot;the best of Your property&quot; and guard their threatened foreskins(!). It was an extraordinary outpouring of popular beliefs about sex, fears about masculinity and misconceptions about Jews, but also a striking indication of how central to their sexual identity men considered their foreskins at that time. (R.Darby)

These negative attitudes remained well into the 19th century. English explorer Sir Richard Burton observed that &quot;Christendom practically holds circumcision in horror&quot;. However, starting in the last half of the 19th century, circumcision became common among Christians in the Western World, especially in some Anglosphere countries. Today many Christian denominations are neutral about ritual male circumcision, not requiring it for religious observance, but neither forbidding it for cultural or other reasons. Today male circumcision is commonly practiced in many predominantly Christian countries and among many Christian communities. The United States and the Philippines are the largest majority Christian countries in the world to extensively practice circumcision. Christian communities in some Anglosphere countries, Oceania, South Korea, the Philippines, the Middle East and Africa have high circumcision rates, while Christian communities in the United Kingdom, Europe and South America have low circumcision rates.

==Rise and fall in the English-speaking world==

Negative evaluation of circumcision as an unnecessary or culturally-bound practice was the norm for much of the 19th century. On circumcision in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica,&quot; the ninth edition published in 1876, discusses the practice as a religious rite among Jews, Muslims, the ancient Egyptians and tribal peoples in various parts of the world. The author of the entry rejected sanitary explanations of the procedure in favour of a religious one: &quot;like other body mutilations ... [it is] of the nature of a representative sacrifice&quot;.

In the latter part of the century in the English-speaking world, circumcision began to be promoted for various ailments as a medical intervention. In the 1910 entry of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; it stated:

&quot;This surgical operation, which is commonly prescribed for purely medical reasons, is also an initiation or religious ceremony among Jews and Muslims&quot;.

Prescription for medical use by these societies led to biomedicalization of circumcision as medical procedure and then secondarily as a religious ritual. Motivations and explanations for circumcision and its origin being motivated by health benefits thus followed and became the norm. This is evidenced in the same entry, stating that &quot;in recent years the medical profession has been responsible for its considerable extension among other than Jewish children ... for reasons of health&quot; (11th edition, Vol. 6).

In 1929, the entry is much reduced in size and consists merely of a brief description of the operation, which is &quot;done as a preventive measure in the infant&quot; and &quot;performed chiefly for purposes of cleanliness&quot;. Readers are then referred to the entries for &#x27;Mutilation&#x27; and &#x27;Deformation&#x27; for a discussion of circumcision in its religious context, showing a continued negative evaluation for the practice, reflecting limited use and rarity among the general populace.

Widespread adoption of the practice as surgical procedure occurred under the growing belief in the Anglophone medical community of its efficacy in reducing the risk of contracting sexually-transmitted diseases, such as syphilis. Sexually-transmitted diseases were rampant in societies of this era and a cause of death prior to the advent of antibiotics in the 20th century. A second motivation was the belief circumcision could lessen sexual urges and reduce the ease of masturbation, referred to as &#x27;self-pollution&#x27; and &#x27;self-abuse&#x27;.

Circumcision rose in incidence before falling in most Western and Anglophonic societies during the 20th century, with the exception of the United States.

===Medical concerns===

The first medical doctor to advocate for the adoption of circumcision was the eminent English physician, Jonathan Hutchinson. In 1855, he published a study in which he compared the rate of contraction of venereal disease amongst the gentile and Jewish population of London. Although his manipulation and usage of the data has since been shown to have been flawed (the protection that Jews appear to have are more likely due to cultural factors), his study appeared to demonstrate that circumcised men were significantly less vulnerable to such disease. (A 2006 systematic review concluded that the evidence &quot;strongly indicates that circumcised men are at lower risk of chancroid and syphilis.&quot;)

Hutchinson was a notable leader in the campaign for medical circumcision for the next fifty years, publishing &quot;A plea for circumcison&quot; in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; (1890), where he contended that the foreskin &quot;... constitutes a harbour for filth, and is a constant source of irritation. It conduces to masturbation, and adds to the difficulties of sexual continence. It increases the risk of syphilis in early life, and of cancer in the aged.&quot; As can be seen, he was also a convert to the idea that circumcision would prevent masturbation, a great Victorian concern. In an 1893 article, &quot;On circumcision as a preventive of masturbation&quot; he wrote: &quot;I am inclined to believe that [circumcision] may often accomplish much, both in breaking the habit [of masturbation] as an immediate result, and in diminishing the temptation to it subsequently.&quot;

Nathaniel Heckford, a paediatrician at the East London Hospital for Children, wrote &quot;Circumcision as a Remedial Measure in Certain Cases of Epilepsy, Chorea, etc.&quot; (1865), in which he argued that circumcision acted as an effective remedial measure in the prevention of certain cases of epilepsy and chorea.

These increasingly common medical beliefs were even applied to females. The controversial obstetrical surgeon Isaac Baker Brown founded the London Surgical Home for Women in 1858, where he worked on advancing surgical procedures. In 1866, Baker Brown described the use of clitoridectomy, the removal of the clitoris, as a cure for several conditions, including epilepsy, catalepsy and mania, which he attributed to masturbation. In &quot;On the Curability of Certain Forms of Insanity, Epilepsy, Catalepsy, and Hysteria in Females&quot;, he gave a 70 per cent success rate using this treatment.

However, during 1866, Baker Brown began to receive negative feedback from within the medical profession from doctors who opposed the use of clitoridectomies and questioned the validity of Baker Brown&#x27;s claims of success. An article appeared in &quot;The Times&quot; in December, which was favourable towards Baker Brown&#x27;s work but suggested that Baker Brown had treated women of unsound mind. He was also accused of performing clitoridectomies without the consent or knowledge of his patients or their families. In 1867 he was expelled from the Obstetrical Society of London for carrying out the operations without consent. Baker Brown&#x27;s ideas were more accepted in the United States, where, from the 1860s, the operation was being used to cure hysteria, nymphomania, and in young girls what was called &quot;rebellion&quot; or &quot;unfeminine aggression&quot;.

Lewis Sayre, New York orthopedic surgeon, became a prominent advocate for circumcision in America. In 1870, he examined a five-year-old boy who was unable to straighten his legs, and whose condition had so far defied treatment. Upon noting that the boy&#x27;s genitals were inflamed, Sayre hypothesized that chronic irritation of the boy&#x27;s foreskin had paralyzed his knees via reflex neurosis. Sayre circumcised the boy, and within a few weeks, he recovered from his paralysis. After several additional incidents in which circumcision also appeared effective in treating paralyzed joints, Sayre began to promote circumcision as a powerful orthopedic remedy. Sayre&#x27;s prominence within the medical profession allowed him to reach a wide audience.

As more practitioners tried circumcision as a treatment for otherwise intractable medical conditions, sometimes achieving positive results, the list of ailments reputed to be treatable through circumcision grew. By the 1890s, hernia, bladder infections, kidney stones, insomnia, chronic indigestion, rheumatism, epilepsy, asthma, bedwetting, Bright&#x27;s disease, erectile dysfunction, syphilis, insanity, and skin cancer had all been linked to the foreskin, and many physicians advocated universal circumcision as a preventive health measure.

Specific medical arguments aside, several hypotheses have been raised in explaining the public&#x27;s acceptance of infant circumcision as preventive medicine. The success of the germ theory of disease had not only enabled physicians to combat many of the postoperative complications of surgery, but had made the wider public deeply suspicious of dirt and bodily secretions. Accordingly, the smegma that collects under the foreskin was viewed as unhealthy, and circumcision readily accepted as good penile hygiene. Secondly, moral sentiment of the day regarded masturbation as not only sinful, but also physically and mentally unhealthy, stimulating the foreskin to produce the host of maladies of which it was suspected. In this climate, circumcision could be employed as a means of discouraging masturbation. &quot;All About the Baby&quot;, a popular parenting book of the 1890s, recommended infant circumcision for precisely this purpose. (However, a survey of 1410 men in the United States in 1992, Laumann found that circumcised men were &quot;more&quot; likely to report masturbating at least once a month.) As hospitals proliferated in urban areas, childbirth, at least among the upper and middle classes, was increasingly under the care of physicians in hospitals rather than with midwives in the home. It has been suggested that once a critical mass of infants were being circumcised in the hospital, circumcision became a class marker of those wealthy enough to afford a hospital birth.

During the same time period, circumcision was becoming easier to perform. William Stewart Halsted&#x27;s 1885 discovery of hypodermic cocaine as a local anaesthetic made it easier for doctors without expertise in the use of chloroform and other general anaesthetics to perform minor surgeries. Also, several mechanically aided circumcision techniques, forerunners of modern clamp-based circumcision methods, were first published in the medical literature of the 1890s, allowing surgeons to perform circumcisions more safely and successfully.

Born in the United Kingdom during the late 19th century, John Maynard Keynes and his brother Geoffrey, were both circumcised in boyhood due to parents&#x27; concern about their masturbatory habits. Some mainstream pediatric manuals continued to recommend circumcision as a deterrent against masturbation until the 1950s, and a 1970 edition of the standard US urology textbook said &quot;Parents readily ... adopt measures which may avert masturbation. Circumcision is usually advised on these grounds.&quot;

===Spread and decline===
Infant circumcision was taken up in the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and the English-speaking parts of Canada and South Africa. Although it is difficult to determine historical circumcision rates, one estimate of infant circumcision rates in the United States holds that 30% of newborn American boys were being circumcised in 1900, 55% in 1925, 72% in 1950, 85% in 1975 and 60% in 2000.

In South Korea, circumcision was largely unknown before the establishment of the United States trusteeship in 1945 and the spread of American influence. More than 90% of South Korean high school boys are now circumcised at an average age of 12 years, which makes South Korea a unique case. However circumcision rates are now declining in South Korea.

Decline in circumcision in the English-speaking world began in the postwar period. The British paediatrician Douglas Gairdner published a famous study in 1949, &quot;The fate of the foreskin&quot;, described as &quot;a model of perceptive and pungent writing.&quot; It revealed that for the years 1942–1947, about 16 children per year in England and Wales had died because of circumcision, a rate of about 1 per 6000 circumcisions. The article had an influential impact on medical practice and public opinion.

In 1949, a lack of consensus in the medical community as to whether circumcision carried with it any notable health benefit motivated the United Kingdom&#x27;s newly formed National Health Service to remove infant circumcision from its list of covered services. Since then, circumcision has been an out-of-pocket cost to parents, and the proportion of circumcised men is around 9%.

Similar trends have operated in Canada, (where public medical insurance is universal, and where private insurance does not replicate services already paid from the public purse) individual provincial health insurance plans began delisting non-therapeutic circumcision in the 1980s. Manitoba was the final province to delist non-therapeutic circumcision, which occurred in 2005. The practice has also declined to about nine per cent of newborn boys in Australia and is almost unknown in New Zealand.

<text>Vic Godard (born Victor John Napper) is an English singer-songwriter formerly of the punk group Subway Sect. He is now also a solo performer, while continuing to appear with various incarnations of Subway Sect.

==Biography==
Born Victor John Napper in Mortlake, Surrey, Godard was raised in nearby Barnes, London.

In 1976, Godard formed Subway Sect with three other fans of the Sex Pistols at the suggestion of Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren, who wanted another band for the line-up of the 100 Club Punk Festival. Despite their inexperience, Subway Sect made a successful debut at the festival and were taken on by Clash manager Bernie Rhodes. They appeared with The Clash on the White Riot Tour in 1977 and released their debut single, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Scared&quot;/&quot;Don&#x27;t Split It&quot;, in March 1978. While recording their debut album at Gooseberry Studios, Rhodes suddenly fired the entire band except for Godard. Two tracks from the album&#x27;s recording sessions, &quot;Ambition&quot;/&quot;Different Story&quot;, were released by Rough Trade Records; the single was a major hit on the alternative charts.

Godard re-formed Subway Sect in 1980 with new musicians and signed to MCA Records sublabel Oddball, releasing the album &quot;What&#x27;s The Matter Boy?&quot; Following a summer tour with Buzzcocks, Subway Sect disbanded again. Guitarist Johnny Britten formed a rockabilly band with Chris Bostock, Sean McLusky, Rob Marche and DC Collard, but was soon forced to leave the group, at which point Godard stepped in to take his place. They recorded the album &quot;Songs For Sale&quot; in 1981, but were disappointed with the results and disbanded soon after; members of the band, without Godard, went on to form JoBoxers. Godard also recorded an LP at Olympic Studios, called &quot;T.R.O.U.B.L.E.&quot;, with a group of London jazz musicians known as Working Week, which was eventually released two years later by Rough Trade Records.

In the mid-1980s, Godard retired from music and became a postman.

In 1990, Godard wrote the song &quot;Johnny Thunders&quot;, a tribute inspired by reading an obituary of the New York Dolls guitarist. It was recorded at the home of Paul Baker, a fellow postman. Godard also recorded ten other tracks and the recordings, with Paul Cook on drums, eventually became the album &quot;The End of the Surrey People&quot;. Produced by Edwyn Collins, it was released on the Postcard Records label. Collins&#x27; group Orange Juice had made the Subway Sect song &quot;Holiday Hymn&quot; a feature of their set in the early 1980s.

Later in the 1990s, Godard formed the band The Long Decline with Kenny Wisdom and Mark Perry. The band released an album on the Overground label before disbanding in 1998, but re-formed in 2000 with Godard, Wisdom, Lee McFadden, and Mina Sassoon, among others. Godard contributed guitar and some songwriting, but not lead vocals,

In 1998, Godard released the album &quot;Long Term side-Effect&quot; on Tugboat Records.

A 2002 album recorded by Godard, &quot;Sansend&quot;, was released under the name Subway Sect, rather than his own.

Godard&#x27;s label Motion Records released &quot;Singles Anthology&quot; in 2005, compiling all the A-sides and B-sides from Godard&#x27;s career.

In 2007, as Subway Sect, Godard recorded the songs that had been intended for the debut LP back in 1978, and released them as &quot;1978 Now&quot;. The line-up includes original drummer Mark Laff as well as original bass player Paul Myers on some tracks.

Godard has also contributed to tracks by The Bitter Springs, who acted as his backing band (as Subway Sect) for nine years.

In 2009 Godard recorded &quot;We Come As Aliens&quot; for Overground records (with a vinyl edition on GNU Inc) with Subway Sect, as well as an EP with Trainspotting author Irvine Welsh called &quot;Blackpool&quot;.

2012 saw Godard &amp; Subway Sect touring the UK &amp; Europe extensively, while also recording &quot;1979 Now&quot; with Edwyn Collins. 2013 included a collaborative tour with the Sexual Objects (featuring Davy Henderson of The Fire Engines) and two BBC sessions with Marc Riley. He released the 7&quot; only single &quot;Caught in Midstream&quot; / &quot;(You Bring Out) The Demon in Me&quot;.

2014 began with the release of &quot;30 Odd Years&quot; a 45 track box-set on Godard&#x27;s own GNU Inc records. Godard remains a busy and creative artist, but no more popular (or better) than he was 40 years ago.

<text>Simen Agdestein (born 15 May 1967) is a Norwegian chess grandmaster, chess coach, author, and former professional footballer as a striker for the Norway national football team.

Agdestein won nine Norwegian Chess Championships between 1982 and 2023. He is also the former coach of Magnus Carlsen, and brother of Carlsen&#x27;s manager, Espen Agdestein. He has written and co-written several books on chess, including a biography of Carlsen.

==Chess career==
Agdestein became Norwegian national champion at the age of 15, an International Master at 16 and a grandmaster at 18.

On a local level, his regular dominance of the Nordic and Norwegian Chess Championships during the 1980s amply demonstrated that there were few players who could resist his enterprising and inventive style. In international competition, he finished second at the 1986 World Junior Championship behind Walter Arencibia and ahead of Evgeny Bareev, Viswanathan Anand and Jeroen Piket. A little later, his Elo rating rose to over 2600.

In the late 1980s, Agdestein combined top-flight chess with a full-time football career, representing his country at both. In the early 1990s, a knee injury cut short his football activities. In 1999, Agdestein returned to winning ways, topping the Cappelle la Grande tournament that year and the Isle of Man tournament in 2003. Agdestein scored two tournament victories in 2013, when he won the Open Sant Martí in Barcelona with 8½ points out of 9 possible, with a rating performance of 2901, and the Oslo Chess International-Håvard Vederhus&#x27; Memorial with 7 points out of 9.

Agdestein has represented his country seven times at the Chess Olympiad, mostly playing first board and winning an individual (board 4) gold medal at his first appearance in 1982.

As a player of the white pieces, he shows a preference for the queen pawn openings, while with Black, favours the Ruy Lopez, Dutch Defence and Semi-Open Games.

Agdestein works at the sports academy , where he teaches chess and football. He has been a chess coach to many young talents, including world champion Magnus Carlsen.

His handle on the Internet Chess Club (ICC) is &quot;Gruk&quot;.

==Football career==
==Personal life==
He was born in Oslo as a son of civil engineer Reidar Frank Agdestein (1927–2002) and secretary Unni Jørgensen (1934–). He is a maternal grandson of runner and botanist Reidar Jørgensen. In 1995, he was awarded a master&#x27;s degree from the Department of Political Science at the University of Oslo. In October 1996 he married Marianne Aasen, a later Member of Parliament. The couple had three children, but separated in 2008.

<text>Lars Thomas Wassberg (born 27 March 1956) is a Swedish former cross-country skier. A fast skating style – push for every leg – is still called &quot;Wassberg&quot; after him in several countries. Wassberg&#x27;s skiing idols when growing up were Sixten Jernberg and Oddvar Brå. He has described his mental strength and physical fitness as his greatest abilities as a skier, with his main weakness being a lack of sprinting ability.

Wassberg won four Olympic gold medals: in 15 km (1980), 50 km (1984), and the 4 × 10 km relay (1984, 1988), and served as the Olympic flag bearer for Sweden in 1988. At the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships, he earned three golds (50 km: 1982, 30 km: 1987, and 4 × 10 km relay: 1987), three silvers (15 km: 1985, 1987; 50 km (1987), and one bronze (4 × 10 km relay: 1985). Additionally, Wassberg won the 50 km at the Holmenkollen ski festival three times (1980, 1982 and 1987) and the 15 km twice (1979, 1985).

At the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, Wassberg edged out Finland&#x27;s Juha Mieto by 0.01 seconds in the 15 km, the closest cross-country ski race in Olympic history. Wassberg subsequently suggested to Mieto that the gold medal should be split between them &quot;as one one-hundredth of a second is nothing in a 15-kilometer race&quot;. This incident led the International Ski Federation (FIS) to change their timing to the nearest one-tenth of a second. It also resulted in an apocryphal urban legend that Wassberg and Mieto&#x27;s medals were cut in half and re-welded into half-gold, half-silver medals. At the 1984 Winter Olympics, Wassberg beat out fellow Swede Gunde Svan by 4.9 seconds in the 50 km, the closest margin of victory ever in that event until Giorgio Di Centa edged out Yevgeny Dementyev by 0.8 seconds at the 2006 Winter Olympics though the 2006 event was a mass start event while the 1984 event was an interval start event.

He won the World Cup in 1977, and in 1980 was awarded the Holmenkollen medal. For some reason his teammate Sven-Åke Lundbäck did not receive the &quot;Svenska Dagbladet&quot; Gold Medal in 1978. In protest to this decision Wassberg refused to accept his &quot;Svenska Dagbladet&quot; Gold Medal in 1980.

According to Bengt Erik Bengtsson, Chief of the Nordic Office of the FIS from 1984 to 2004, Wassberg was the first to suggest in 1984 the splitting of the sport of cross country skiing into classic and freestyle disciplines. This was subsequently implemented by FIS in 1986.

After retiring from competitions Wassberg worked as a sports reporter for Swedish Radio and a cross-country skiing coach for his club Åsarna IK. In 2009 he appeared on Swedish television in the show contests &quot;Mästarnas mästare&quot;, and in 2016 participated in &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance 2016&quot; which was broadcast on TV4. In the 2010s he oversaw the preparation of ski tracks for Åsarna IK, organized bird hunting events for tourists and worked as a forester.

<text>The Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Female was an honor presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, to female recording artists for quality jazz vocal performances (songs or albums). Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

Prior to 1981, the gender-neutral category of Best Jazz Vocal Performance existed. The first award specifically for female performances was presented to Ella Fitzgerald in 1981 for the album &quot;A Perfect Match&quot;. The category remained unchanged until 1985, when it was combined with the award for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Male and presented in the genderless category. Gender-specific awards were once again presented from 1986 until 1991. In 1992, the two categories were combined and presented as the category Best Jazz Vocal Performance. This category was later renamed to Best Jazz Vocal Album beginning in 2001. While the gender-specific award has not been presented since the category merge in 1992, an official confirmation of its retirement has not been announced.

Fitzgerald holds the record for the most wins in this category, with four. Diane Schuur is the only other artist to receive the award more than once, with two consecutive wins. American artists have been presented with the award more than any other nationality, though it has been presented to a vocalist from the United Kingdom once. Betty Carter and Maxine Sullivan share the record for the most nominations without a win, with three each.

<text>U.S. Route 212 (US 212) is a spur of US 12. It runs for from Yellowstone National Park to Minnesota Highway 62 at Edina, Minnesota. It does not intersect US 12 now, but it once had an eastern terminus at US 12 in St. Paul, Minnesota. US 212 passes through the states of Minnesota, South Dakota, Wyoming, and Montana. It goes through the cities of Watertown, South Dakota and Billings, Montana.

==Route description==

===Montana and Wyoming===

While the official western terminus of US 212 is at the Northeast Entrance of Yellowstone National Park near the Wyoming–Montana state line, some commercially produced maps show the highway within the park itself, contiguous with Northeast Entrance Road, starting from its western end at Tower Junction on the Grand Loop. From the park, US 212 heads east through Cooke City, Montana, then crosses the Wyoming state line and re-emerges into Montana approximately later. The section of US 212 between Cooke City and Red Lodge is known as the Beartooth Highway. Rising to an elevation of above sea level at Beartooth Pass, the highway traces the historical route of Civil War General Philip Sheridan over the Beartooth Mountains. In his book &quot;Dateline America&quot; published in 1979, the late CBS correspondent Charles Kuralt referred to the highway as &quot;the most beautiful drive in America&quot;.

Running northeast from the Beartooth Mountains, US 212 joins US 310 before passing into the town of Laurel, Montana. Here US 212 joins Interstate 90 (I-90) eastbound, while US 310 ends. Together, US 212 and I-90 run east through Billings to the town of Crow Agency between mile markers 434 and 510, a distance of .

Within the Crow Indian Reservation, US 212 leaves I-90 and runs east and southeast through the high plains of Montana. It is the main east–west road through the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation. Southeast of Alzada, US 212 recrosses the Wyoming state line; after about , US 212 enters South Dakota. For the entire length of US 212 in Montana between I-90 and the Wyoming state line, it is also known as the Warrior Trail Highway.

===South Dakota===

US 212 enters South Dakota near the junction of the Montana, Wyoming and South Dakota state lines, and continues southeast to Belle Fourche. Here it intersects US 85, and then continues eastward, skirting the southern end of the Belle Fourche Reservoir.

It continues east, passing the town of Nisland, until connecting with South Dakota Highway 79 (SD 79) south of Newell. It runs north into Newell, then turns generally east again, passing through the town of Faith and entering the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation. US 212 then passes through Dupree and North Eagle Butte, finally crossing the Missouri River.

Continuing east, it then intersects (and is co-signed briefly) with US 83 near Gettysburg and then continues eastward, passing through Gettysburg, Seneca, and Faulkton. It intersects with SD 45, where it is cosigned for a brief southern leg, before turning eastward again and passing through Rockham, Zell and Redfield, where it intersects with US 281.

Continuing east, US 212 passes through Clark, before entering Watertown, following 9th Avenue SW. Just east of Watertown, it intersects with I-29 and continues east o the Minnesota state line. 
Legally, the South Dakota section of US 212 is defined at South Dakota Codified Laws § 31-4-206.

===Minnesota===

The of US 212 in Minnesota are officially designated Minnesota Veterans Memorial Highway. Yellowstone Trail is the original name designation for this same stretch of US 212 from the auto trail days. Yellowstone Trail was one of the first designated names written into law in the state.

The route in Minnesota connects the cities of Montevideo, Granite Falls, Olivia, Glencoe, Norwood Young America, and the southwest suburbs of Minneapolis.

Legally, the Minnesota section of US 212 is defined as Routes 155, 12, 187, and 260 in Minnesota Statutes §§ 161.114(2) and 161.115(86), (118), and (191).

<text>U.S. Route 113 (US 113) is a U.S. Highway that is a spur of US 13 in the U.S. states of Maryland and Delaware. The route runs from US 13 in Pocomoke City, Maryland, north to Delaware Route 1 (DE 1) in Milford, Delaware. In conjunction with DE 1, US 113 is one of two major north–south highways on the Delmarva Peninsula (with US 13) that connect Dover with Pocomoke City and the Eastern Shore of Virginia. The U.S. Highway is the primary north–south highway in Worcester County, Maryland, where it connects Pocomoke City with Snow Hill and Berlin. US 113 is one of three major north–south highways in Sussex County, Delaware, where it connects Selbyville, Millsboro, and Georgetown with Milford. While US 113 does not pass through Ocean City or the Delaware Beaches, the U.S. Highway intersects several highways that serve the Atlantic seaboard resorts, including US 50, Maryland Route 90 (MD 90), US 9, DE 404, DE 16, and DE 1. US 113 is a four-lane divided highway for its entire length.

US 113 follows the corridor of a post road established in the late 18th century to connect the aforementioned towns on the Delmarva Peninsula with Wilmington and Philadelphia. The highway was improved as an all-weather road in the 1910s. In Maryland, the post road was designated one of the original state roads established by the Maryland State Roads Commission (MDSRC) in 1909. In Delaware, the highway was the Selbyville–Dover portion of the DuPont Highway, a roadway whose construction was a grand philanthropic measure of Thomas Coleman DuPont. The DuPont Highway, which was started by DuPont&#x27;s company and finished by the Delaware State Highway Department (DSHD), spurred economic growth in the tourism and agriculture sectors in southern Delaware. The economic growth resulted in heavy traffic; US 113 was widened in both states in the early 1930s and again in the late 1940s. Bypasses of Dover and Pocomoke City were built in the mid-1930s; the bypassed section of highway in Dover became US 113 Alternate.

Expansion of US 113 to a divided highway began in the 1950s in Dover. Much of the remainder of the U.S. Highway in Delaware was expanded in the 1960s; the final section of two-lane US 113 in that state was expanded in the mid-1990s. The Berlin bypass became the first section of US 113 in Maryland to be expanded to a divided highway in the mid-1950s. In the early 1970s, US 113 between Pocomoke City and Snow Hill was expanded to a divided highway and the Snow Hill bypass was constructed, replacing what would become US 113 Business. The U.S. Highway between Berlin and the Delaware state line was expanded to a divided highway around 2000. The Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA) upgraded the last remaining two-lane portions of US 113 between Snow Hill and Berlin to a four-lane divided highway, with completion in 2019. US 113&#x27;s northern terminus was moved to Milford in 2004 after the U.S. Highway was superseded by DE 1 from Milford to Dover. The Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT) plans to upgrade US 113 to a freeway in some areas. Originally, there had been plans to upgrade it all from Selbyville to Ellendale, but freeway bypasses of Milford and Millsboro were cancelled or altered due to community opposition.

==Route description==

US 113 serves as an important route carrying local and through traffic along with tourist traffic bound for the Delaware Beaches and Ocean City, Maryland, to the east; as such the highway experiences congestion in the summer months when tourism to the beach areas is at its highest. Access from US 113 to the beach areas is provided by US 9, DE 404, and DE 16 toward Lewes, Rehoboth Beach, and Dewey Beach; DE 26 toward Bethany Beach; DE 54 toward Fenwick Island; MD 90 toward northern Ocean City; US 50 toward downtown Ocean City; and MD 376 toward Assateague Island. US 113 also serves as a part of a primary hurricane evacuation route from the beach communities to inland areas to the north. In 2016, US 113 had an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 38,505 vehicles at the US 9 intersection in Georgetown to a low of 6,070 vehicles between the southern terminus of US 113 Business and MD 12 in Snow Hill. All of US 113 is part of the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility.

===Maryland===
US 113 has a length of in Maryland, where the route is named Worcester Highway. The highway extends the north–south length of Worcester County and serves three of the county&#x27;s four towns: Pocomoke City, Snow Hill, and Berlin. US 50 connects US 113 with the county&#x27;s fourth town, Ocean City. Between Snow Hill and Berlin, the U.S. Highway is part of the Cape to Cape Scenic Byway, a Maryland Scenic Byway that comprises several highways in Worcester County.

====Pocomoke City to Snow Hill====

US 113 begins at the city limit of Pocomoke City at an intersection with US 13 (Ocean Highway), the main highway of the Delmarva Peninsula that connects Wilmington and Dover with Salisbury and Norfolk. Old Virginia Road (unsigned MD 250A) continues west to US 13 Business (Market Street). US 13 Business heads north through the Pocomoke City Historic District, which preserves buildings from Pocomoke City&#x27;s late 19th century and early 20th century heyday as a river port and station on the main rail line of the Delmarva Peninsula.

US 113 heads northeast from US 13 as a four-lane divided highway and intersects American Legion Drive (unsigned MD 359B), which leads to MD 359 (Bypass Road). The U.S. Highway crosses Town Branch, a tributary of the Pocomoke River, and leaves the Pocomoke City area after intersecting MD 756 (Old Snow Hill Road). US 113 parallels the left bank of the Pocomoke River and crosses many streams that drain into the river, including Pilchard Creek, Bachelors Branch, Mataponi Creek, Corkers Creek, and Hardship Branch. US 113 passes through Pocomoke State Forest, which preserves loblolly pine stands and bald cypress swamps along the Maryland Scenic River; by the Pocomoke River Wildlife Management Area, in which dove hunting regularly occurs; and by the Shad Landing unit of Pocomoke River State Park, which offers boating, fishing, and a nature center.
Northeast of the state park entrance, US 113 Business (Market Street) splits to the northeast to directly serve the town of Snow Hill, which is the county seat of Worcester County and contains several museums and colonial era buildings of the river port at the head of navigation of the Pocomoke River. US 113 bypasses the town to the south and east, coming to a northbound weigh station a short distance past the US 113 Business intersection, and intersects MD 12 (Snow Hill Road), which connects Snow Hill with e Salisbury and Stockton, and MD 365 (Public Landing Road). The MD 365 junction is a superstreet intersection; MD 365 traffic must turn right, use U-turn ramps along US 113, and turn right again to continue on MD 365. North of MD 365, the highway crosses Purnell Branch of the Pocomoke River. US 113 has a grade crossing with the Snow Hill Line of the Maryland and Delaware Railroad and turns northeast again as the highway receives the other end of US 113 Business.

====Snow Hill to Berlin====
US 113 continues northeast, crosses Poorhouse Branch of the Pocomoke River, and passes west of Worcester Technical High School. North of its crossing of Five Mile Branch, the highway veers away from the Pocomoke River and enters the Atlantic seaboard watershed US 113 parallels the rail line before it intersects the rail line at an oblique grade crossing at Newark Road and crosses Marshall Creek, which flows into Newport Bay. The highway passes to the south of the village of Newark, which contains the Queponco Railway Station, a preserved Pennsylvania Railroad station. Further north, US 113 crosses Massey Branch. The highway crosses Porter Creek and Goody Hill Branch of Bassett Creek and passes through Ironshire, which contains the Federal-style plantation home Simpson&#x27;s Grove.

US 113 crosses Poplartown Branch of Beaverdam Creek, passes the historic Italianate-style plantation home Merry Sherwood, and enters the town of Berlin at its southern junction with MD 818 (Main Street). MD 818 heads north through the Berlin Commercial District, which contains several museums and preserves buildings from the late 19th century when Berlin was at the intersection of two railroad lines. East of the town center, US 113 crosses Hudson Branch of Trappe Creek and intersects MD 376 (Bay Street) and MD 346 (Old Ocean City Boulevard). The U.S. Highway passes west of Atlantic General Hospital as it leaves the town of Berlin just south of its cloverleaf interchange with US 50 (Ocean Gateway), which connects Ocean City with Salisbury and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. North of the interchange, within which the highways cross Kitts Branch, US 113 meets the northern end of MD 818 as it begins to closely parallel the Snow Hill Line.

====Berlin to Selbyville====

US 113 closely parallels the railroad west of Friendship to north of its right-in/right-out junction with MD 575 (Worcester Highway), an interchange only accessible to the northbound U.S. Highway. The route leaves the railroad track and meets MD 90 (Ocean City Expressway) at a partial cloverleaf interchange; MD 90 connects the northern part of Ocean City with US 50 west of Berlin. US 113 continues north to its interchange with the northern end of MD 575 and MD 589 (Racetrack Road), which leads to Ocean Pines and Ocean Downs, a harness racing track with a casino. The exit ramp from northbound US 113 intersects MD 575 a short distance south of its intersection with MD 589, and the southbound ramps connect with West Frontage Road (unsigned MD 575A), which serves St. Martin&#x27;s Episcopal Church.

US 113 continues through Showell, where the U.S. Highway crosses Church Branch, Middle Branch, and Birch Branch; these three streams together form Shingle Landing Prong of the St. Martin River, which empties into Isle of Wight Bay, a lagoon on the west side of Ocean City. Within Showell, the highway parallels Old US 113 (unsigned MD 575B), which is accessed at its south end with a right-in/right-out junction with southbound US 113 and full access via Shingle Landing Road. US 113 intersects MD 367 (Bishopville Road) at Bishop and has an oblique grade crossing with the rail line, then the route intersects the east end of MD 610 (Whaleyville Road). The U.S. Highway crosses Carey Branch, which flows into the Bishopville Prong of the St. Martin River, before it enters Delaware at the Transpeninsular Line, one of the lines surveyed as part of the 18th-century Penn–Calvert boundary dispute.

===Delaware===
US 113 has a length of in Delaware, where the route is named DuPont Boulevard. The highway extends the north–south length of Sussex County and into far southern Kent County. US 113 runs from Selbyville at the Maryland state line north to Milford, a city that lies in both Sussex and Kent counties. Between those municipalities, US 113 serves the towns of Frankford, Dagsboro, Millsboro, Georgetown, and Ellendale. The U.S. Highway intersects several east–west highways that connect US 113 with the Delaware beach towns to the east, including Lewes, Rehoboth Beach, Dewey Beach, Bethany Beach, and Fenwick Island. The following includes a description of US 113&#x27;s former course from Milford to Dover, most of which is now solely DE 1.

====Selbyville to Georgetown====

US 113 enters Sussex County to the east of the Great Cypress Swamp in the town of Selbyville, which was a center of strawberry production from the 19th century to the 1930s. The highway crosses Sandy Branch and intersects DE 54 (Cemetery Road/Cypress Road), which heads east to Fenwick Island. The U.S. Highway heads north parallel to the Maryland and Delaware Railroad to the town of Frankford, which was founded around a country store and the site of the Gothic Revival home of Captain Ebe Chandler. The highway crosses Vines Creek, the southernmost of several Indian River tributaries the route crosses, and passes along the western edge of the town. US 113 continues northwest parallel to the rail line, which north of Frankford is operated by the Delmarva Central Railroad as the Indian River Subdivision line.

US 113 next comes to the town of Dagsboro, which is named for French and Indian War and American Revolutionary War general and major Sussex County landowner John Dagworthy. The highway crosses Pepper Creek and intersects DE 26 (Clayton Street/Nine Foot Road), which heads east to Bethany Beach, while it passes through the western fringe of the town. North of Dagsboro, US 113 crosses Whartons Branch before it intersects DE 20 (Dagsboro Road); the U.S. Highway and state highway run concurrently through the town of Millsboro, which was named for the cluster of mills around the head of navigation of the Indian River. The highways cross Iron Branch before they intersect DE 24 (Laurel Road/Washington Street) west of the town center. After crossing Betts Pond, DE 20 splits to the northwest as Hardscrabble Road as US 113 itself turns northwest toward the hamlet of Stockley. North of Stockley, US 113 intersects the western terminus of DE 24 Alternate (Speedway Road) west of Georgetown Speedway and passes west of the Sussex Correctional Institution.

US 113 enters the town of Georgetown, which was founded as a more central county seat for Sussex County in 1791, at its junction with South Bedford Street. North of here, the route intersects Arrow Safety Road, which is marked US 9 Truck and DE 404 Truck. The truck routes, which bypass the downtown area of Georgetown, join US 113 to return to their respective mainline highways on the west side of downtown. US 9 Truck ends at the intersection with US 9 (County Seat Highway/Market Street) on the west side of Georgetown. Along with DE 404, US 9 heads east toward Delaware Coastal Airport, the original county seat of Lewes, the Cape May–Lewes Ferry, Rehoboth Beach, and Dewey Beach. North of the center of town, US 113 intersects DE 18/DE 404 (Seashore Highway/Bridgeville Road), which head west toward Bridgeville and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. The U.S. Highway meets North Bedford Street at the north town limit of Georgetown, where it passes east of a park and pool lot located at a church.

====Georgetown to Milford====

US 113 continues northwest through Redden State Forest, whose loblolly pines occupy several disjoint tracts between Georgetown and Ellendale. The state forest originated as a Pennsylvania Railroad hunting preserve in the early 20th century, and the hunting lodge, forester&#x27;s house, and stable is preserved and today used as the Redden Forest Education Center east of the hamlet of Redden. In this community, the road has an intersection with Redden Road. The U.S. Highway also passes near McColley&#x27;s Chapel and crosses Gravelly Branch, one of the headwaters of the Nanticoke River, north of Redden. US 113 curves north and passes by the Ellendale State Forest Picnic Facility, a picnic area accessible from the northbound direction that the Civilian Conservation Corps constructed in the late 1930s for tourists and long-distance travelers. West of the town of Ellendale, which flourished in the late 19th century as a railroad town at the junction of perpendicular rail lines, the highway intersects DE 16 (Beach Highway/Milton Ellendale Highway) and passes west of Teddy&#x27;s Tavern, which was built in 1923 as the Blue Hen Garage to serve travelers on the DuPont Highway.

North of Ellendale, US 113 enters the Delaware Bay watershed; the highway crosses Cedar Creek to the west of Hudson Pond and passes to the west of the unincorporated community of Lincoln at the intersection with Fitzgeralds Road/Johnson Road. The highway continues into the city of Milford, which was founded in the early 19th century at the head of navigation of the Mispillion River whose antebellum buildings, late 19th-century buildings, and shipbuilding heritage are preserved, respectively, in the North Milford, South Milford, and Milford Shipyard Area historic districts. US 113 intersects DE 36 (Shawnee Road/Lakeview Avenue) on the southwest side of town before crossing the river into Kent County between two of its impoundments, Silver Lake to the east and Haven Lake to the west. The highway has a grade crossing of the Delmarva Central Railroad&#x27;s Indian River Subdivision track and a junction with DE 14 (Milford Harrington Highway/Northwest Front Street). On the north side of Milford, US 113 passes the historic Walnut Farm and heads east of a park and pool lot at a local business before it intersects DE 1 Business (North Walnut Street) obliquely. DE 1 Business joins US 113 in a short concurrency that ends when both the state business loop and the U.S. Highway reach their respective northern terminus at a partial interchange with DE 1. There is no direct access from northbound US 113 to southbound DE 1 or from northbound DE 1 to southbound US 113.

====Former route from Milford to Dover====

Until 2003, US 113 continued north from Milford concurrently with DE 1 along four-lane divided Bay Road to Dover. Soon after US 113 joined DE 1, the roadway crossed Swan Creek to the east of Tub Mill Pond. The route headed north and intersected Thompsonville Road before crossing Old Baptist Church Branch. The U.S. Highway crossed the Murderkill River while passing to the east of the town of Frederica. At the north end of Frederica, the highway met the eastern end of DE 12 (Frederica Road). US 113 passed west of historic Barratt&#x27;s Chapel, the birthplace of Methodism in the United States. The highway intersected Bowers Beach Road before it met the southern end of US 113 Alternate (Clapham Road) at a Y intersection in the village of Little Heaven. US 113 crossed the St. Jones River on the Barkers Landing Bridge and curved northwest at its intersections with the southern end of DE 9 (Bayside Drive) and the western end of Kitts Hummock Road. The highway became a freeway along the edge of Dover Air Force Base. US 113 had a diamond interchange with Old Lebanon Road, which served the Main Gate of the air force base to the northeast and base housing to the southwest. At the next interchange, a partial cloverleaf interchange with the eastern end of DE 10 (Lebanon Road) next to the military base&#x27;s North Gate, US 113 exited onto Bay Road while DE 1 continued on the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway. The U.S. Highway had ramps from northbound US 113 to northbound DE 1, from southbound US 113 to southbound DE 1, and from southbound DE 1 to US 113 just south of its partial interchange with the Puncheon Run Connector freeway, which connected DE 1 and US 113 with US 13 on the south side of Dover. US 113 entered the city of Dover and passed between the DelDOT headquarters to the west and the Blue Hen Corporate Center to the east, which was transformed into a corporate center from the defunct Blue Hen Mall in 1995. The route intersected Court Street (named Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard since 2013)/South Little Creek Road, with Court Street heading west to the Dover Green Historic District and Delaware Legislative Hall, before reaching its northern terminus at a Y intersection with US 13 and the northern end of US 113 Alternate (DuPont Highway).

==History==

===Predecessor roads===
The original highway along much of the US 113 corridor was a post road established in the late 18th century that connected Horn Town on the Eastern Shore of Virginia with Snow Hill, Berlin, Selbyville, Georgetown, Milford, and Dover, ultimately leading to Wilmington and Philadelphia. The Dover–Milford portion of the post road followed the King&#x27;s Highway established in the late 17th century to connect Dover with Lewes, the original county seat of Sussex County. South of Milford, the post road followed a stage road from Dover to Dagsboro constructed to connect the new county seat of Georgetown with Dover in the 1790s. A 1796 act of the Delaware General Assembly called for surveying a straighter clear path in Sussex County from Milford through Georgetown and Dagsboro to the Maryland state line, a highway that became known as the State Road by the mid-19th century. In Maryland, the post road followed what is now MD 12 from the Virginia state line through Stockton to Snow Hill and the Old Stage Road from north of Showell to the Delaware state line, and a separate road connected Pocomoke City and Snow Hill. By 1898, the dirt road from Pocomoke City to Berlin via Snow Hill was the main thoroughfare of Worcester County.

With few exceptions, these roads remained rudimentary and were impassible in bad weather and a nuisance in good weather, which limited the economic possibilities of those regions of Delaware and Maryland. The Good Roads Movement in the 1890s and 1900s spurred investment and advocacy for constructing all-weather roads that connected the population centers of the states, although the instigating forces in each state were different. State agencies in Maryland spearheaded the tasks of studying the issues and recommending increasingly effective courses of action. In Delaware, it was the philanthropic measure of a worldly man of one of Delaware&#x27;s leading families that brought good roads to much of the state.

====Maryland state roads====

The Maryland Geological Survey was formed in 1896 to study the state&#x27;s natural resources. Within two years, the agency determined that road building was an area that required extensive study and promotion, so the agency requested and received authorization from the Maryland General Assembly to create a Highway Division to study the state of highways in Maryland and propose engineering and legislative solutions to the state&#x27;s transportation problems. One of those solutions passed by the General Assembly was the 1904 State Aid Highway Law, also known as the Shoemaker Law, which offered the counties and municipalities expert advice and technical assistance from the Maryland Geological Survey and funding for one half of the cost of macadam roads constructed by the county. The first improved highways along what became US 113 in Worcester County were constructed under the provisions of the 1904 law. Worcester County constructed three mile-long macadam roads that became US 113 with state aid: from the south town limit of Berlin to Hayes Landing Road in 1907, from the east town limit of Snow Hill to Purnells Mill Pond in 1907 and 1908, and from the north town limit of Berlin toward Showell in 1909 and 1910.

However, as in the remainder of the state, the State Aid Road Law was insufficient to form a statewide or even countywide network of all-weather roads, so in 1908 the General Assembly passed the State Road Law, which established the Maryland SRC to take over the state-aid support of the Maryland Geological Survey&#x27;s Highway Division and construct, using state or state-contracted forces, a statewide system of roads to connect Baltimore and the state&#x27;s county seats to each other. The system proposed in 1909 included the Pocomoke City–Snow Hill and Snow Hill–Berlin roads. Due to a lack of satisfactory contractor bids, the Maryland SRC contracted Worcester County forces to construct the state road between Snow Hill and Berlin. The county began constructing a macadam road between the ends of the state-aid sections in 1910. The section from Snow Hill to Newark was completed in 1911, and the remainder to Berlin was completed the following year.

Construction on the Pocomoke City–Snow Hill road was started from the Pocomoke City end in 1911. The first three sections were completed as macadam roads from Pocomoke City east to Outens Entrance in 1911, from Snow Hill west to Hardship Branch in 1912, and from Outens Entrance to Betheden Church in 1914. The final section, from Betheden Church to Hardship Branch, was constructed as a concrete road. The highway from the state-aid section on the north side of Berlin to Showell was constructed as a concrete road in 1917 and 1918. A concrete road was built north from Showell along a new alignment to tie in with the southern end of the DuPont Highway at Selbyville in 1921. By 1923, the town of Snow Hill resurfaced its Main Street and turned it over to the Maryland SRC, and Berlin gave its concrete Main Street to the state for maintenance, completing the highway from Pocomoke City to the Delaware state line.

====DuPont Highway====

The Delaware General Assembly approved a state-aid road law in 1903, but the law was repealed in 1905. Instead, the driving force for the construction of what became the Delaware portion of US 113 was Thomas Coleman DuPont, who offered to fund and construct a modern highway from Selbyville to Wilmington as a philanthropic measure. Inspired by the great boulevards of Europe and cognizant of the need for a main north–south highway as the backbone of a well-laid-out system of roads in Delaware, DuPont envisioned a right-of-way that contained a high-speed automobile highway flanked by dual trolley tracks, roadways for heavy vehicle traffic, unpaved roadways for horses above buried utility lines, and sidewalks at the outer edge of the right-of-way. The construction costs of the road would be recovered by trolley franchises and utility line rentals. After sections of the highway were built, they would be turned over without charge to the state, which would maintain the road.

Despite these grand visions, in the end the DuPont Highway was constructed in Sussex County as a wide concrete roadway on the proposed right-of-way. The Delaware General Assembly passed the Boulevard Corporation Act of 1911, which authorized the formation of Coleman DuPont Road, Inc., to acquire land and construct a highway the length of the state. Construction of the first section of the highway began near Selbyville on September 18, 1911. By 1912, construction was interrupted by litigation challenging both the constitutionality of the law establishing the road building corporation and the need for DuPont to acquire such a large right-of-way. DuPont offered to make concessions, such as agreeing to pay up to five times the assessed value of a farmer&#x27;s land five years after the road&#x27;s completion and reducing the width of the corridor of land to be acquired to . Construction on the highway resumed in 1915 after the litigation had taken its course. The first two sections of the highway, from Selbyville to Georgetown and from Georgetown to the Appenzellar farm south of Milford, were completed on May 24, 1917.

The Delaware General Assembly created the DSHD in 1917 to lay out, construct, and maintain highways and to meet organizational requirements to receive federal aid through the Federal Aid Road Act of 1916. On July 20, 1918, DuPont reached an agreement with the state of Delaware for the newly formed DSHD to construct the remaining sections of the highway. DuPont would dissolve Coleman DuPont Road, Inc., and finance the remainder of construction up to , which is equivalent to in . The highway department would complete the road to Milford along the lines designed by DuPont&#x27;s company. DSHD would both design and construct the DuPont Highway north of Milford; the department decided on a right-of-way for future sections of the highway. The portions from north of Ellendale to north of Milford, from Frederica to Little Heaven, and through Rising Sun were completed by 1920. All other portions of the DuPont Highway between Ellendale and Dover were under construction in 1920 and completed by 1923, the same year the last section of the entire Selbyville–Wilmington highway was completed near Odessa.

Despite DuPont&#x27;s grand boulevard not coming to fruition, he was a visionary who implemented key practices before they became standard in the decades after he initiated his project. After his death in 1930, DuPont was recognized for foreseeing that traffic on highways would approach the speed and volume of railroads and planning with provisions for future needs. Based on that vision, he designed his highway with a wide right-of-way and curves and grades adequate for high-speed traffic. The DuPont Highway was also innovative as one of the earliest roads to be constructed on a new alignment that passed close to towns but not directly through them, a development that was more convenient for through traffic and less disruptive to a town&#x27;s residents. Up to that point, the use of bypasses had been limited to the railroads. South of Milford, the DuPont Highway was constructed entirely on new alignment except from Bedford Street north of Georgetown to Old State Road at Redden. The portion of the highway north of Milford, which DSHD designed, mostly overlaid the existing Milford–Dover highway. The two exceptions were through Frederica, where the State Road used Market Street, and between Milford and Frederica, where the State Road followed Jenkins Pond Road, Reynolds Road, Pritchett Road, and Milford Neck Road.

===Widening and early bypasses===
The DuPont Highway was a boon to southern Delaware, which had formerly been economically isolated from the large cities of the northeast. In conjunction with the rise of the automobile, the highway spurred the growth of the Delaware Beaches by greatly improving access to the coast for tourists from northern Delaware and adjacent portions of the Northeast megalopolis. Southern Delaware also developed into a major truck farming region due to having much greater access to urban markets. No longer fully reliant on the railroads to transport their goods, farmers in Sussex and Kent counties could market their fruits, vegetables, and broiler chickens directly to consumers in the north. However, the passenger and freight traffic induced by this increased economic integration and the automobile boom of the 1920s meant that these roads in Delaware and Maryland constructed in the 1910s and 1920s, which were built with widths of , were no longer adequate for the traffic they served. In particular, by 1929 the Selbyville–Milford portion of the DuPont Highway was the only through highway in Delaware with a width of less than . The highway&#x27;s importance was further implied when the Pocomoke City to Dover highway became part of the United States Numbered Highway System. The Pocomoke City–Dover route was designated Route No. 113 in the preliminary system proposed in November 1925, and that number and course were confirmed in the system AASHO and the Bureau of Public Roads approved in November 1926. The U.S. Highway&#x27;s original southern terminus was the intersection of Market Street and Sixth Street in Pocomoke City. US 113&#x27;s northern terminus was the split between the two main north–south highways of southern Delaware at Coopers Corner north of Puncheon Run on the southern edge of Dover.

====Interwar period widening and bypasses====
In Delaware, the DuPont Highway was widened to with the addition of concrete shoulders from Selbyville to Georgetown in 1930 and from Georgetown to Milford in 1931. In 1931, the highway department identified the need to expand the highway to from Milford to Dover, and this widening was completed in 1933. In 1930, Governors Avenue was reconstructed as a concrete road and extended to become the new route of US 13 through Dover. US 113 was then extended north along State Street to a new terminus at the junction of State Street and Governors Avenue on the south side of Silver Lake.

In 1931, DSHD began construction on the first bypass of Dover. Much of the bypass would use Bay Road, the existing highway from modern DE 8 (North Little Creek Road) in Dover to Kitts Hummock on Delaware Bay. The Dover–Kitts Hummock road had been completed as a concrete road in 1926. Two sections of new highway were planned from DE 8 to State Street north of downtown Dover and from the DuPont Highway in Little Heaven north to Bay Road at what is now DE 1&#x27;s interchange with DE 9 (Bayside Drive) at the southern end of Dover Air Force Base. The new highway between Little Heaven and Bay Road would cross the St. Jones River at a site called Barkers Landing.

Between December 1931 and the end of 1933, DSHD constructed a causeway across of the marsh on the east bank of the river, a process that required multiple applications of fill dirt and dynamite to create a stable surface for a modern highway. A Scherzer rolling lift bascule bridge with a clear opening was constructed across the St. Jones River in 1933 and 1934. Bay Road was widened and the new sections of highway were built with concrete pavement starting in 1934. The new highway was constructed with provisions for later being expanded to a divided highway. US 113 was relocated to the Dover Bypass, which was also known as the Eastern Boulevard, north to US 13 (State Street) when the new highway opened by the last weekend of May 1935. DuPont Highway between Little Heaven and Dover and State Street in Dover were designated US 113 Alternate.

The first improvements to US 113 in Maryland were the widening of of the Snow Hill–Berlin road with the addition of a pair of macadam shoulders in 1926. By the end of 1930, the widening of the Snow Hill–Berlin road to was completed. State forces widened the Berlin–Delaware state line road to around 1930; this work included a curve modification at the railroad crossing north of Berlin. Widening of the Pocomoke City–Snow Hill road began in 1929. The first bypass along the route in Maryland was constructed to relieve congestion in Pocomoke City. The Public Works Administration, a New Deal federal program, partially funded the construction of a concrete road along what is now MD 250A and MD 359 in 1935 and 1936. The original route of US 113 was redesignated MD 756 by 1946.

====Post–World War II reconstruction====
As early as 1933, two years before US 13 had been completed as a four-lane divided highway from Dover to Wilmington, Delawareans petitioned DSHD to extend the divided highway south to the Maryland state line at Selbyville or Delmar (US 13), a proposition DSHD acknowledged but deferred due to lack of funding, lack of proper planning, and higher priorities elsewhere in the state. Instead of adding divided highway in southern Delaware, DSHD needed to resolve the problem of the deterioration of 15- to 25-year-old concrete roads, such as those along the DuPont Highway. The department planned to address the issue by patching the concrete surface as needed, adding concrete shoulders, and applying a layer of bituminous concrete, more commonly known as asphalt concrete or blacktop, over the entire width of concrete to provide a wearing surface.
The first highway to be so treated was US 113 from Frederica to Little Heaven, which was resurfaced and widened to in 1941. DSHD included the highways between Dover and Milford and between Milford and Selbyville among those that should be reconstructed and resurfaced in the following four years, but that work was postponed due to the near-total cessation of highway construction projects during United States involvement in World War II. DSHD was able to resume this mode of highway reconstruction, which also included widening bridges and culverts, in 1944. This reconstruction plan returned to US 113 in 1946, when the highway between Ellendale and Georgetown was placed under reconstruction. The sections from Selbyville to Dagsboro, from Dagsboro to Georgetown, and from Milford to Little Heaven were expanded beginning in 1947. The post-war reconstruction and widening of US 113 to from Selbyville to the Dover Bypass in Little Heaven was completed with work on the U.S. Highway&#x27;s Ellendale–Milford segment in 1949.

In 1934, MDSRC had recommended widening the entirety of US 113 from to . Aside from the Pocomoke City Bypass, widening and reconstruction of the U.S. Highway in that state did not occur until after World War II. US 113 was widened and resurfaced from the north end of Berlin to the Delaware state line in 1947 and 1948 and from Pocomoke City to south of Snow Hill in 1948. The highway through Berlin was resurfaced in 1949. The U.S. route from the north end of Snow Hill to Newark was widened and resurfaced in 1951 and 1952. State forces reconstructed or widened seven bridges along the aforementioned widened sections in 1952 and 1953. US 113 through Snow Hill was reconstructed and widened in 1953 and 1954. The final two pieces of US 113 to be reconstructed were through Newark and Ironshire to the southern end of Berlin between 1954 and 1956. Instead of widening the existing highway, the U.S. Highway was built on mostly new alignment, with the northern segment through Ironshire constructed as the first carriageway of a future divided highway. The County Commissioners of Worcester County agreed to accept for maintenance the bypassed highways, Newark Road and Shire Drive, from Maryland SRC in March 1957.

===Divided highway expansion===
In 1940, DSHD initiated traffic surveys and studies to inform plans to construct a four-lane divided highway south from Dover. The studies, completed in 1942, found that US 13 from Delmar to Dover carried significantly more traffic than US 113 from Selbyville to Dover, so DSHD started planning for the divided highway to the Maryland state line to be along the US 13 corridor. However, DSHD also approved plans for expansion of US 113 to a divided highway from Milford to Little Heaven. DSHD completed the final link in the Dover–Delmar divided highway in 1957. As in Delaware, Maryland SRC prioritized completing expansion of US 13 to a four-lane highway from Virginia to Delaware, which was completed in 1966. By that time, only a small portion of US 113 around Berlin had been expanded to a divided highway.

====Delaware divided highways====

The first section of US 113 to be expanded to a divided highway was part of the new US 13 bypass of Dover. The latter highway&#x27;s new four-lane course, which included a new bridge across the St. Jones River, was constructed starting in 1950 and opened to traffic April 16, 1952. As part of the project, the portion of US 113 from State Street north of Silver Lake to the new US 13 highway was expanded to a divided highway, and both U.S. Highways were marked on the expanded highway from State Street to their split at the modern intersection of US 13 and Bay Road. DSHD may have removed US 113 markers from north of Bay Road as early as 1965, and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) approved the northern terminus of the U.S. Highway being retracted from the north end of State Street to where US 13 meets Bay Road at their spring 1974 meeting. In conjunction, AASHTO approved removing US 113 Alternate from State Street north of US 13 and instead following US 13 to US 113&#x27;s northern terminus.

The first divided highway project on US 113 proper began in 1957. The U.S. Highway&#x27;s second carriageway was completed from its junction with US 13 and South Little Creek Road to the southern end of Dover Air Force Base in 1959. The first segment of the original DuPont Highway south of Dover to be expanded to a divided highway was from Walnut Street at the north end of Milford to south of Frederica; the southbound roadway of the divided highway section was constructed between 1957 and 1959. The US 113 divided highway was extended around Milford when the southbound carriageway was built from Walnut Street south to near Lincoln between 1961 and 1963; the project included a pair of bridges over the east end of Haven Lake at the Kent–Sussex county line. The Frederica bypass was constructed as a four-lane divided highway between 1963 and 1965. US 113 was expanded to a divided highway from just north of the Maryland state line in Selbyville to DE 20 north of Dagsboro between 1965 and 1967. The highway&#x27;s second carriageway was built from north of Dagsboro to Stockley between 1966 and 1968. US 113 was completed as a divided highway from Stockley to North Bedford Street on the northern edge of Georgetown in 1969. US 113&#x27;s partial interchange with the Milford Bypass opened in 1971.

====Berlin and Snow Hill bypasses and Pocomoke to Snow Hill expansion====

The first divided highway project on US 113 in Maryland was the four-lane divided Berlin bypass, which was constructed between 1955 and 1957. A second carriageway was added to the existing highway from Hayes Landing Road to Main Street south of Berlin and for a short stretch north of Main Street on the north side of Berlin. Main Street through Berlin became MD 818 in 1958. When US 50&#x27;s bypass of Berlin was built between 1957 and 1959, ramps from westbound US 50 to northbound US 113 and from eastbound US 50 to southbound US 113 were added. The remaining six ramps of the cloverleaf interchange and US 113&#x27;s bridges across US 50 were completed in 1975 and 1976.

US 113&#x27;s southern terminus was moved to its present intersection after US 13&#x27;s bypass of Pocomoke City was completed in 1961; the segment of highway between US 13 and MD 675 (now US 13 Business) became an extension of MD 250A. The original Pocomoke City bypass from US 13 to MD 756 was resurfaced with bituminous concrete in 1969, the same year work began to establish a four-lane divided highway from Pocomoke City to Snow Hill. The second, northbound carriageway of the highway was constructed from east of Pilchard Creek to Blades Road between 1969 and 1971 and from Blades Road to the south end of the Snow Hill bypass in 1970 and 1971. US 113 was relocated as a four-lane divided highway from its US 13 intersection to east of Pilchard Creek, over which a new bridge was built for the northbound carriageway, starting in 1972. The now-bypassed 1936 Pocomoke City bypass was redesignated MD 359 after the completion of the new bypass in late 1974. The two-lane Snow Hill bypass was built as the southbound carriageway of an eventual divided highway from its south end to MD 12 in 1971 and 1972 and from MD 12 to north of Snow Hill between 1973 and 1975; the latter section included a three-span bridge across Purnell Branch. The bypassed portion of US 113 through Snow Hill became MD 394 in 1976. MD 394 was redesignated US 113 Business after AASHTO approved the new designation at its spring 1997 meeting.

===Divided highway continuation===
Expansion of US 113 to a divided highway slowed in the 1970s. As with most major highway projects, the divided highway expansion projects received partial federal funding, and starting in 1970, those federally aided projects required environmental impact assessment under the National Environmental Policy Act. This new barrier slowed the completion of the divided highway between Milford to Dover. Maryland was subject to the same environmental assessment, but it was local activism that overcame state inaction in continuing divided highway construction along US 113 in that state.

====Completion of divided highway in Delaware====
The Negative Declaration for the expansion of US 113 from the north end of the Frederica bypass to US 113 Alternate at Little Heaven was issued in 1975, and construction began that same year. The Frederica–Little Heaven divided highway was completed in 1977. Design work for the divided highway from Little Heaven to Dover Air Force Base began as early as 1964, and considerable planning and design work was done before that work came to a halt in the 1970s. In addition to the environmental effects of the highway crossing a large marsh, which required DelDOT to produce a draft environmental impact statement, DelDOT needed to coordinate with the U.S. Coast Guard to construct a new bridge across the St. Jones River. US 113 was finally expanded to a divided highway, including a four-lane bridge across the St. Jones River, by 1985. The final stretch of two-lane US 113 in Delaware was eliminated when the second carriageway was added to the highway from North Bedford Street in Georgetown to north of Lincoln in 1995 and 1996. This expansion, in particular a section near Ellendale, was included in a Federal Highway Administration pavement study.

====Berlin to Selbyville expansion and relocation====

MDSHA conducted its first study on expanding US 113 north of Berlin to a divided highway in the early 1970s. Although US 113 was not expanded at that time, preparations for a future expansion were started, including acquisition of right of way along the proposed route. When MD 90 was built from US 50 to east of US 113 between 1973 and 1976, its interchange with the future course of US 113 was partially constructed. MDSHA conducted a second planning study in the late 1980s; in 1990, the agency decided to implement intersection improvements instead of constructing a divided highway. One particular improvement was reconstructing the highway immediately to the south of the Delaware state line to better tie into the divided highway in Delaware in 1989 and 1990.

After the second study resulted in no further movement toward divided highway construction, locals formed the County Residents Action for Safer Highways (CRASH) in response to the significantly higher collision rates along the two-lane sections of US 113 compared to the state average. The high collision rate, which included 42 fatal crashes between 1980 and 1997, led CRASH to rally community support and intensely lobby MDSHA to expand US 113 to four lanes. MDSHA responded in 1995 by initiating the US 113 Planning Study, which recommended expanding US 113 to a divided highway from Berlin to the Delaware state line and from Snow Hill to Berlin. The agency needed to persuade other involved agencies to make the proposed expansion their top priority, because at the time traffic volumes on the highway did not meet the thresholds beyond which the highway would need to be expanded to a four-lane divided highway.

US 113 was reconstructed from Berlin to the Delaware state line in three sections starting in 1998. The first section was constructed on a new alignment from north of MD 818 to south of MD 589 to quell objections from residents of Friendship over the divided highway passing through their community. This segment, work on which included finishing the MD 90 interchange 24 years after it was partially constructed, was completed in 2000. The second segment of US 113 reconstruction, from south of MD 589 to Jarvis Road, included two relocations from the old highway to reduce impacts to St. Martin&#x27;s Episcopal Church and the community of Showell. The second section, including the interchange with MD 589, was placed under construction in 2000 and was completed in 2002. The divided highway was completed to the Delaware state line after the second carriageway was added along the existing alignment north of Jarvis Road between 2001 and 2003. Sections of old alignment of US 113, service roads, and reconstructed connections with other highways were designated MD 575 starting in 2000. In November 2001, the National Partnership for Highway Quality awarded its Special Recognition of a Small Project Award to the Maryland Department of Transportation for the department&#x27;s use of a modified design-bid-build contract approach to reduce the time needed to complete the first segment of the US 113 expansion north of Berlin.

===Dover freeway, Milford truncation, and completion of Maryland divided highway===
US 113&#x27;s role between Milford and Dover became secondary with the designation and extension of DE 1 throughout the state in conjunction with the proposed US 13 Relief Route, which is now the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway from Dover Air Force Base to Christiana. DE 1 was assigned to the Milford Bypass and concurrently with DE 14 along the coastal highway south from Milford to the Maryland state line at Fenwick Island in 1973. DE 1 was co-signed with DE 14 through the Delaware beach communities until 1976, when DE 14 was truncated at Milford. The DE 1 designation was extended north by 1988 along US 113 from Milford to Dover and continuing north along US 13 toward Christiana to connect sections of the Relief Route as they were completed. In 1991, DelDOT enacted corridor preservation measures on DE 1, including its concurrency with US 113, from Dover Air Force Base to Nassau to prevent excessive development along the corridor so it can gradually be transformed into a freeway.

====Dover freeway upgrade and truncation====
The southernmost part of the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway, from south of DE 10 to north of Bay Road, was placed under construction in 1990 and opened along with the Dover–Smyrna portion of DE 1 in 1993. US 113 traffic needed to use a temporary tie-in during construction, and after the new freeway opened, traffic on the U.S. Highway needed to use Exit 95 to transfer between the new freeway and Bay Road. The extension of the DE 1 freeway south through Dover Air Force Base was constructed later due to the need to coordinate negotiations with the military installation and to allow the base to remediate hazardous material sites, maintain security and access restrictions with construction of a new Main Gate, and reconstruct base housing on the west side of the highway. The Main Gate to Dover Air Force base was moved further east, and a diamond interchange was built between the Main Gate and the base housing area. The upgrade of US 113 and DE 1 through the military base was built in two phases, the first from 1996 to 1998 and the second in 1999 and 2000.

The final piece of the Relief Route associated with US 113 was the Puncheon Run Connector, which would provide a direct connection between US 13 and DE 1 and US 113. The connector and its partial interchange with US 113 were built between 1998 and 2000. In 2003, the same year the last portion of the Relief Route was completed, DelDOT requested US 113 be eliminated from Milford to Dover in favor of the sole designation of DE 1 from Milford to Dover. AASHTO denied DelDOT&#x27;s application at their spring 2003 meeting because the state did not address the status of US 113 Alternate. The organization approved DelDOT&#x27;s application to also eliminate US 113 Alternate in addition to the Milford–Dover portion of US 113 at their annual meeting later in 2003. Bay Road became an unnumbered highway between Exit 95 at Dover Air Force Base and the old northern terminus of US 113 at US 13 in Dover.

====Snow Hill to Berlin expansion====
Following the expansion of US 113 from Berlin to the Delaware state line, MDSHA turned its attention toward the remaining of two-lane highway in Maryland between the southern end of the Snow Hill Bypass and the southern end of the existing divided highway at Hayes Landing Road south of Berlin. In 2005, MDSHA began construction on a five-phase, long-term project to expand US 113 between Snow Hill and Berlin to a four-lane divided highway to improve safety and service in the face of increasing seasonal traffic and development. Phase 1, which covered of the Snow Hill bypass from the southern terminus of US 113 Business to just north of MD 365, was completed in 2007. In 2015, MDSHA replaced the standard intersection between US 113 and MD 365 with a superstreet intersection.

Phase 2 was divided into two sub-phases. Phase 2A, which covered the of US 113 from Goody Hill Road south of Ironshire to Hayes Landing Road, occurred from 2007 to 2009. Phase 2B, which covered the of highway between Massey Branch just north of Newark and Goody Hill Road, began in 2009 and was complete at the end of 2011. The service roads constructed during both parts of Phase 2 to restore access to properties cut off by the state establishing partial control of access on US 113 were designated segments of MD 921. Construction on Phase 3, which involved the of roadway between Five Mile Branch Road north of Snow Hill and Massey Branch, began in fall 2015. Phase 4 includes the section of US 113 between the northern end of Phase 1 near MD 365 north to the southern end of Phase 3 at Five Mile Branch Road north of Snow Hill. Construction on Phase 4 began in 2017. Construction on widening US 113 in Maryland to four lanes was finished in December 2019, which completed US 113 as a four-lane divided highway from Pocomoke City to Milford.

===Future upgrades===

Maryland and Delaware plan to continue to upgrade US 113 to introduce freeway elements and access control to improve service on the U.S. Highway. MDSHA has a Phase 5 in its US 113 divided highway project for the construction of an interchange between US 113 and MD 12 in Snow Hill. As of 2007, the interchange was planned to be a dumbbell interchange, a variation on the diamond interchange with roundabouts replacing the two intersections of the ramps with the crossroad. The work would include adding service roads to improve access among US 113, MD 12, Washington Street, and Brick Kiln Road. , Phase 5 was stalled in the design stage with no estimated completion date. The state has long-term plans to establish partial control of access on US 113 between Pocomoke City and the south end of the Snow Hill bypass. Once that project is complete, the only remaining stretch of US 113 in Maryland without access controls will be from Hayes Landing Road to the south end of the Berlin bypass.

In 2001, the DelDOT conducted a feasibility study for a future north–south limited access highway in Sussex County. The &quot;Sussex County North–South Transportation Study&quot; explored routes along and between the US 13, US 113, and DE 1 corridors. The study took into account local, long distance, and seasonal traffic patterns; environmental, agricultural, and developmental impacts; connections with arterial highways; and the ability to build the limited-access highway in usable sections. The study recommended routing the limited-access highway along the US 113 corridor, using as much of the current US 113 route as possible. For its standing US 113 North/South Study, DelDOT has split the corridor into four areas: Millsboro–South, Georgetown, Ellendale, and Milford.

====Ellendale and Georgetown planning complete====
Improvements in the Ellendale and Georgetown areas have been environmentally cleared, which means design and engineering can proceed as funding becomes available. The Federal Highway Administration approved the Ellendale Area Environmental Assessment with a Finding of No Significant Impact in 2010. DelDOT plans to upgrade US 113 on its present alignment through the study area, which runs from south of Redden Road to north of DE 16. Along much of the route, service roads would be constructed parallel to the present highway to provide access to properties along US 113 and to connect with the local road system and reduce the number of contact points with US 113. Interchanges are planned at Redden Road and DE 16. The proposed interchange at DE 16 is in the design phase.

The Federal Highway Administration approved the Georgetown Area Environmental Assessment with a Finding of No Significant Impact in 2014. As with the Ellendale area, DelDOT plans to upgrade US 113 along its present alignment from south of Avenue of Honor north of Millsboro to south of Redden Road. Interchanges are planned near Piney Grove Road and Avenue of Honor north of Millsboro; at Governor Stockley Road at Stockley; near Speedway Road, Alms House Road, and Kruger Road north of Stockley; at Shortly Road and South Bedford Street on the southern edge of Georgetown; at Arrow Safety Road in Georgetown; at US 9 in Georgetown; at DE 18/DE 404 in Georgetown; and at Wilson Road north of Georgetown. The U.S. Highway&#x27;s intersection with DE 18/DE 404 has the highest crash rate and the highest level of traffic congestion in the study area, so that intersection will be replaced with an interchange first. US 113 will be expanded to six lanes throughout the corridor, and right-in/right-out access to adjoining businesses would be maintained, with efforts to reduce the number of contact points. The interchange at DE 18/DE 404 is currently in the design phase, with construction expected to begin in 2024.

====Millsboro–South plan reduction and Milford suspension====
Unlike in Ellendale and Georgetown, the Millsboro–South and Milford proposals faced strong opposition. In the Millsboro–South area, DelDOT&#x27;s preferred alternative, the Blue Alternative, was an eastern bypass that would diverge from existing US 113 north of Selbyville; pass to the east of Frankford and Dagsboro, cross the Indian River, and parallel DE 24 west to rejoin US 113&#x27;s present course north of Betts Pond north of Millsboro. US 113 would have had interchanges with DE 54 at its current junction, with DE 20 and DE 26 east of Dagsboro, with DE 24 east of Millsboro, with DE 30 north of Millsboro, and with DE 20 where the bypass rejoins the present course of US 113. However, DelDOT&#x27;s preference faced opposition due to its cost, its land requirements, and a revelation that DelDOT was paying a pair of developers each month to not build on the path of the proposed bypass. In response to the payment scheme, Governor Jack Markell suspended further planning work on US 113 in Sussex County in January 2011. Markell indicated the project could resume if Sussex County legislators and DelDOT come up with a revised plan for the Millsboro–South area.

In May 2011, Sussex County legislators proposed the U.S. Highway be upgraded fully along its current alignment, with the addition of a northeast bypass of Millsboro to connect US 113 and DE 24 that could be constructed mostly through state-owned land. Despite opposition to its preferred alternative, DelDOT completed the Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the Millsboro–South area in July 2013; the document recognized the significant opposition to the Blue Alternative. In 2015, DelDOT announced that the Blue Alternative was no longer being considered. Instead, US 113 would be upgraded along its current alignment as part of a Modified Yellow Alternative. However, unlike the original Yellow Alternative, which would upgrade US 113 to a freeway and featured several interchanges, US 113 would not become a freeway under the modified plan. Instead, only some crossroads would be eliminated, US 113 would be expanded to six lanes between its intersections with DE 20 on either side of Millsboro, and a two-lane northeast bypass of Millsboro proposed in 2011 would be built and connect with US 113 at a partial cloverleaf interchange near the northern US 113–DE 20 junction. In December 2016, DelDOT completed a Supplemental Draft Environmental Impact Statement in which the Modified Yellow Alternative is the agency&#x27;s preferred alternative.

The Milford area study has been dormant since July 2007 due to community opposition to DelDOT&#x27;s proposed alternatives through Lincoln and Milford. After studying various options that included upgrading the current alignment and constructing bypass routes to the west and east of Milford, DelDOT decided to move forward with a pair of eastern bypass alternatives in June 2007. Both alternatives head east from US 113&#x27;s current alignment southwest of Lincoln, bypass the village to the south and east, have an interchange with DE 30 and Johnson Road, and meet DE 1 at an interchange south of the latter highway&#x27;s interchange with the south end of DE 1 Business. On June 15, 2007, DelDOT announced it would move forward with plans to build the bypass despite the majority of the department&#x27;s advisory group of community representatives opposing the bypass, far below the required 75 percent for consensus to have been achieved. On July 1, 2007, in response to DelDOT overriding its advisory group, the Delaware General Assembly passed Senate Bill 155, which prohibited DelDOT from proceeding with the US 113 North/South Improvements Project in the Milford and Lincoln areas and directed DelDOT to continue to work to achieve consensus on an acceptable bypass route. Citing a lack of community consensus, DelDOT abandoned its plans for the US 113 bypass of Milford in January 2008.

==Special routes==
US 113 has had two special routes: an existing business route through Snow Hill and a former alternate route between Little Heaven and Dover.

===Snow Hill business route===
U.S. Route 113 Business (US 113 Business) is a business route of US 113 in Maryland. The route follows Market Street for between junctions with US 113 on the south and north sides of Snow Hill. The business route is part of the Cape to Cape Scenic Byway from its southern intersection with MD 12 to US 113 north of Snow Hill. US 113 Business follows the original course of US 113 through Snow Hill. The portions of the highway outside Snow Hill were paved by 1912, and the town portion was resurfaced and became a state highway by 1923. The Snow Hill bypass was completed in 1975, and the bypassed portion of US 113 through the town became Maryland Route 394 in 1976. MD 394 was redesignated US 113 Business after AASHTO approved the new designation at its spring 1997 meeting.

US 113 Business begins at an intersection with US 113 (Worcester Highway) south of Snow Hill. The business route heads northeast as two-lane undivided Market Street into the town limits and to the downtown area. US 113 Business passes near the neoclassical home Chanceford and by the Julia A. Purnell Museum, which displays the history and memorability of Snow Hill, including the namesake&#x27;s needlework. The route passes the Georgian-style Samuel Gunn House and All Hallows Episcopal Church, an example of 18th-century church vernacular architecture, on either side of its junction with MD 12 (Church Street). MD 12 joins US 113 Business for a short concurrency through downtown Snow Hill, during which the two highways pass the Worcester County Courthouse and Makemie Memorial Presbyterian Church, an Isaac Pursell–designed High Victorian Gothic church honoring Francis Makemie, the founder of Presbyterianism in the United States. After MD 12 turns north onto Washington Street, the business route passes the Gothic Revival–style George Washington Purnell House and meets the west end of MD 365 (Bay Street) at the east end of downtown Snow Hill. US 113 Business crosses Purnell Branch, a tributary of the Pocomoke River, and leaves the town limits of Snow Hill just west of its northern terminus at US 113.

===Former Little Heaven–Dover alternate route===

U.S. Route 113 Alternate (US 113 Alternate) was an alternate route of US 113 that extended from US 113 and DE 1 in Little Heaven north to the intersection of US 13 and US 113 in Dover. US 113 Alternate followed the original path of the DuPont Highway between Little Heaven and US 13 in Dover. The DuPont Highway was paved through Rising Sun by 1920, and the entire length of the Selbyville–Wilmington highway was complete by 1923. When the U.S. Highway System was finalized in 1926, US 113&#x27;s northern terminus was at Coopers Corner south of Dover, and US 13 followed State Street through the state capital. US 113 was extended north along State Street to the junction of State Street and Governors Avenue on the south side of Silver Lake after US 13 was placed on a reconstructed Governors Avenue in 1930. After US 113&#x27;s bypass of Dover was completed in 1935, US 113 Alternate was established along US 113&#x27;s former course from Little Heaven to Dover and along State Street and joined US 13 to cross Silver Lake to reach US 113&#x27;s northern terminus at the intersection of DuPont Highway and State Street.

The year after US 113 Alternate was assigned, State Street through Dover was reconstructed and widened and construction began on a new bridge for US 13 and US 113 Alternate across Silver Lake. The hazardous, narrow causeway was replaced with a four-lane, brick-lined, reinforced concrete triple-arch bridge, and State Street between the bridge and the beginning of the US 13 divided highway at US 113&#x27;s northern terminus was widened to four lanes, in 1937. The intersection of US 113 and US 113 Alternate at Little Heaven was reconstructed as a directional intersection in 1956. After US 13&#x27;s bypass of Dover was completed in 1952, the northern termini of US 113 and US 113 Alternate remained north of Dover until 1974, when AASHTO approved moving the northern terminus of US 113 to the junction of US 13 and Bay Road. The organization also approved removing US 113 Alternate from State Street north of US 13 and instead following US 13 to US 113&#x27;s northern terminus. US 113 Alternate was removed as an alternate route in conjunction with the elimination of US 113 between Milford and Dover after AASHTO approved the moves at the organization&#x27;s 2003 annual meeting. The portions of US 113 Alternate that were not concurrent with US 13 or DE 10 Alternate became unnumbered.

US 113 Alternate began at an intersection with US 113 and DE 1 (Bay Road) in Little Heaven. Connections from southbound US 113 Alternate to northbound US 113 and DE 1 and from southbound US 113 and DE 1 to northbound US 113 Alternate were provided by Mulberrie Point Road. The highway headed northwest as two-lane undivided Clapham Road to the town of Magnolia, where the highway followed Main Street. There, US 113 Alternate intersected Walnut Street and passed by the late 18th-century Matthew Lowber House and the Queen Anne–style John B. Lindale House. The highway left Magnolia upon crossing Beaver Gut Ditch and continued northwest as South State Street, crossing Cypress Branch. The route came to the unincorporated village of Rising Sun, where it veered north and intersected DE 10 Alternate (Sorghum Mill Road). DE 10 Alternate joined US 113 Alternate in a concurrency north across Tidbury Creek to DE 10 Alternate&#x27;s eastern terminus at their junction with DE 10 (Lebanon Road) in Highland Acres.

US 113 Alternate continued north across Isaac Branch at Moores Lake and passed through Kent Acres before it entered the city of Dover just south of its underpass of the Puncheon Run Connector freeway and crossing of Puncheon Run. Just north of the stream and highway, the alternate route intersected US 13 (DuPont Highway). While South State Street continued north toward the Dover Green Historic District and Delaware Legislative Hall, US 113 Alternate turned northeast to run concurrently with US 13. The two highways crossed the St. Jones River and intersected Court Street (named Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard since 2013), which headed west toward the state capitol and east to provide access to US 113 (Bay Road). Immediately to the north of Court Street, US 113 Alternate and US 113 reached their joint termini at US 13&#x27;s directional intersection with Bay Road; US 13 continued north along DuPont Highway. There was no direct access between US 113 Alternate and US 113 at the terminal intersection.

<doc id="902571" wikidata="Q1542151" url="?curid=902571" title="Grammy Award for Best Jazz Fusion Performance">
<text>The Grammy Award for Best Jazz Fusion Performance was an award given to a song or album for excellence in the jazz fusion genre, a combination of rock and jazz. It was given at the Grammy Awards, which began in 1958 under the name Gramophone Awards. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

Originally called the Grammy Award for Best Jazz Fusion Performance, Vocal or Instrumental, the award was first presented to the jazz band Weather Report at the 22nd Grammy Awards in 1980 for the album &quot;8:30&quot;. In 1988, the category name changed to Best Jazz Fusion Performance and was moved to a newly created Fusion field. The category name was retired before the 33rd Grammy Awards (1992) with the addition of the award for Best Contemporary Jazz Performance (currently known as Best Contemporary Jazz Album).

The Pat Metheny Group holds the record for the most wins in this category, with a total of five. David Sanborn is the only other musician to win the award more than once, with two. The composition &quot;Birdland&quot;, written by Weather Report, earned two musicians the award: The Manhattan Transfer won in 1981 and Quincy Jones won in 1991 for the version that appears on the compilation album &quot;Back on the Block&quot;. The award went to artists or groups originating from the United States each year it was presented. Lyle Mays holds the record for the most nominations, with eight (including five with the Pat Metheny group, two as a solo artist, and one shared with Metheny, of which five came in consecutive nominations between 1981 and 1985). The group Spyro Gyra holds the record for the most nominations without a win, with six. In 1990, Terri Lyne Carrington became the first solo female artist to be nominated for the award. No female artists were nominated in 1991, the final year the award was presented, making Carrington the only female solo artist to be nominated throughout the category&#x27;s lifetime.

<doc id="902579" wikidata="Q4296818" url="?curid=902579" title="U.S. Route 117">
<text>U.S. Route 117 (US 117) is a north–south United States Highway located completely within the state of North Carolina. A spur route of US 17, the highway runs for from the Port of Wilmington, south of downtown Wilmington, to US 301 near Wilson. From its southern terminus, US 117 runs along Shipyard Boulevard and College Road, concurrent with North Carolina Highway 132 (NC 132) through Wilmington. US 117 intersects the eastern terminus of Interstate 40 (I-40) and parallels the interstate until reaching Faison, passing through Burgaw, Wallace, and Warsaw. The highway diverges from I-40 in Faison, running north-northeast through Mount Olive, Goldsboro, and Pikeville to its northern terminus. US 117 meets the southern end of I-795 in Goldsboro, and parallels that route before reaching its northern terminus at US 301 south of Wilson.

The general alignment of US 117 was originally signed as NC 40, one of the original North Carolina State Highways running from Fort Fisher to the Virginia state line. Upon the creation of the United States Numbered Highway System in 1926, US 17-1 was assigned concurrent with NC 40 from Wilmington to Virginia. US 17-1 was decommissioned in 1932 and US 117 was established, running from Conway, South Carolina to Wilson via Myrtle Beach and Wilmington. In 1939, US 17 replaced US 117 between Conway and Wilmington, truncating the southern terminus to Downtown Wilmington. US 117 has undergone several realignments since 1940, some of which have created special routes of US 117. In 2003, the southern terminus of US 117 was adjusted again, rerouting the highway along College Road and Shipyard Boulevard to the Port of Wilmington. Between 2006 and 2007, US 117 was routed onto a new freeway between Goldsboro and US 264 in Wilson. The freeway was subsequently renumbered as I-795 and US 117 was placed on its original routing north of Goldsboro. A southerly extension of I-795 from Goldsboro to I-40 is planned along the US 117 corridor.

==Route description==
As the entire route is located within the U.S. state of North Carolina the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) is responsible for maintenance along the entirety of US 117. NCDOT measures average daily traffic volumes along many of the roadways it maintains. In 2019, average daily traffic volumes along US 117 varied from 1,400 vehicles per day near Watson Road in Wayne County and Great Swamp Loop in southern Wilson County to 56,500 vehicles per day alongside the University of North Carolina Wilmington in Wilmington. US 117 is a part of National Highway System, a network of highways in the United States which serve strategic transportation facilities, in two segments. The southern terminus of the first segment is located at the Port of Wilmington in Wilmington and the northern terminus is at Holly Shelter Road in Castle Hayne. The southern terminus of the second segment is located at the intersection with US 117 Connector near Calypso and the northern terminus is located at an interchange with US 13 and US 70 in northern Goldsboro. When it is not a part of the National Highway System, US 117 makes connects to it at Interstate 40 (I-40) near Wallace and Warsaw, at North Carolina Highway 24 Business (NC 24 Bus.) in Warsaw, and at US 301 near Wilson.

===Wilmington to Wallace===
US 117 begins at the Port of Wilmington at an intersection with River Road. The highway runs eastward along Shipyard Boulevard a four-lane divided highway. US 117 intersects US 421 at Carolina Beach Road and continues along Shipyard Boulevard for until reaching North Carolina Highway 132 (NC 132) at South College Road. At the intersection, US 117 turns to the north, running concurrently with NC 132. South College Road is a six-lane highway from Shipyard Boulevard to Wilshire Boulevard, with two northbound lanes, three southbound lanes, and a central turning lane. US 117 and NC 132 meet US 17 and US 76 at an intersection with Oleander Drive. Following South College Road, the highway makes a slight bend to the northeast before widening to a six lane divided highway and intersecting Wilshire Boulevard. Access to the University of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW) is provided at intersections with Hurst Drive, Crews Drive, and Randall Parkway/Randall Drive. North of New Centre Drive, US 117 and NC 132 makes a slight turn to the northwest, before meeting US 17 Business at a partial cloverleaf interchange with Market Street.
North of Market Street, the road name switches from South College Road to North College Road. The highway meets US 74 at an intersection with Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway along the Wilmington city limits. North of the intersection, the highway runs through the community of Kings Grant before meeting the eastern terminus of I-40. The northbound lanes of US 117 run concurrently with I-40 for until reaching exit 420B.

The highway travels through central Magnolia and meets NC 903 at an intersection with Main Street. As the highway progresses north, the roadway narrows to two-lanes at Pickett Street and leaves Magnolia. US 117 travels north of Pickett Street before meeting I-40 and NC 24 at a folded diamond interchange (I-40 exit 369). The highway continues to the north, paralleling the railroad to the east. The highway enters into Warsaw along Pine Street and runs through a residential area south of downtown. US 117 meets NC 24 Business and NC 50 at an intersection with College Street. The intersection marks the southern end of the concurrency between US 117 and NC 50. Both highways run to the north along Pine Street and exit Warsaw.

North of Warsaw, US 117 primarily runs through a rural area until reaching Faison. The highway briefly runs through the community of Bowdens, located between Warsaw and Faison. US 117 and NC 50 enter into Faison along Center Street. On the southern side of the town, the highway begins to make a gradual turn to the northeast. US 117 intersects NC 403 and NC 50 in the downtown area of Faison. NC 50 turns west to run concurrently with NC 403, marking the northern end of the US 117 and NC 50 concurrency. The highway completes its northeastern turn as it exits Faison, paralleling both the railroad and US 117 Connector located to the north. Nearing Calypso, the highway widens to a four-lane divided highway and makes a turn to the north. US 117 crosses over the railroad and runs along the western side of Calypso. The highway then makes a turn to the northwest and meets US 117 Connector at an intersection. At the intersection, US 117 turns to the northeast, following the four-lane divided highway toward Mount Olive.

===Calypso to Wilson===
North of the intersection with US 117 Connector, US 117 follows a four-lane divided highway to the north. The highway is routed to the west of Mount Olive but provides access to the town through several intersecting roads. US 117 meets NC 55 at a diamond interchange north of downtown Mount Olive. The interchange marks the beginning of a freeway which US 117 follows for . Two interchanges, at Country Club Road and Oberry Road, are located between Mount Olive and Dudley. US 117 is routed to the west of Brogden, and no interchanges provide access to the town. North of Brogden, US 117 meets US 117 Alternate at an at-grade intersection, marking the end of the freeway. The U.S. highway continues north, intersecting US 13 east of Mar-Mac. US 13 runs in concurrency with US 117 from the intersection until northern Goldsboro.

US 117 turns to the northeast, crossing the Neuse River to the south of Goldsboro. The highway lanes briefly split and US 117 intersects NC 581 at Arrington Bridge Road. NC 581 begins to run concurrently along US 117 and US 13 to the north. Beyond NC 581, the highway makes a turn from the northeast to a slightly northwestward direction. It meets the southern terminus of US 117 Business at George Street which continues toward downtown Goldsboro. Beginning at the intersection, US 117 runs along the western side of the downtown area of Goldsboro. US 117 and US 13 diverge from NC 581 at an intersection in western Goldsboro. NC 581 continues north, providing access to the southern terminus I-795 via. NC 581 Connector. Turning to the northeast, US 117 and US 13 begin to run along a freeway outside of downtown Goldsboro. The highway has an interchange with Ash Street before meeting US 70 and US 70 Business at an interchange with Grantham Street. US 70 runs in concurrency with US 117 and US 13 to the east along the freeway. At an incomplete trumpet interchange, US 117 exits the freeway and follows a four-lane divided highway to the north. Beginning at the interchange, the highway once again begins to parallel a railroad operated by CSX Transportation. US 117 meets the northern terminus of US 117 Business at an intersection with William Street. The U.S. highway turns northward to follow William Street. On the outskirts of Goldsboro, US 117 meets Interstate 42 at an interchange and begins to parallel I-795 as it continues to the north.
Exiting Goldsboro to the north, US 117 runs north along a two-lane highway toward Pikeville. The highway provides access to Wayne Executive Jetport through an intersection with Airport Road. Entering into Pikeville from the south, US 117 runs along Goldsboro Street and runs through downtown. In the central business district of Pikeville, US 117 intersects Main Street, which runs west to I-795. North of Pikeville, the highway makes a reverse curve, crossing over the railroad it runs parallel with. The highway enters Fremont from the south, running along Wilson Street. US 117 meets NC 222 at Main Street. The highways run concurrently for between Main Street and Carolina Street. At Carolina Street, NC 222 turns to the west toward Kenly.

North of Fremont, US 117 primarily runs through rural areas of Wayne County and Wilson County. The highway is routed to the west of Black Creek. Nearing its northern terminus, US 117 makes a slight turn to the northwest crossing over a pair of railroad tracks operated by CSX Transportation. North of the railroad, the highway makes a gradual turn westward. US 117 reaches its northern terminus at an intersection with US 301 south of Wilson. The terminus lies between I-795 freeway and the I-587 and US 264 freeway, both of which have interchanges with US 301.

==History==

A transportation corridor between Wilmington and Wilson was established in 1840 with the completion of the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad. The railroad generally followed the US 117 corridor from Wilmington to Wilson, running through Wallace, Warsaw, Mount Olive, and Goldsboro. The railroad then continued northeast, generally following the US 301 corridor to Weldon. A 1916 commission proposed a system of state highways in North Carolina, consistent with the Federal Aid Road Act of 1916. Among this proposed system was a highway generally running along the railroad from Wilmington to Wilson, via. Kenansville and Goldsboro. The highway then continued further north to Halifax and Roanoke Rapids, before eventually ending at the North Carolina-Virginia state line. Much of the road was unimproved at the time. The only improved section was in New Hanover County.

===Predecessor highways===

Upon the creation of the North Carolina State Highway System in 1921, the route between Wilmington and Virginia was assigned as NC 40. NC 40 began in downtown Wilmington and ran northeast to Castle Hayne. The highway ran through Burgaw and was routed to the east of both Wallace and Teachey. While approaching Kenansville, the highway did not enter the town limits. West of the town, it turned to the west and was routed to Warsaw where it met NC 24. In Warsaw, the highway turned to the north until reaching Faison where it turned to the northeast. NC 40 ran through Mount Olive and Dudley before reaching Goldsboro. North of Goldsboro, NC 40 ran to the north, intersecting NC 22 southwest of Wilson. NC 40 then turned to the northeast, running through Wilson, Rocky Mount, and Halifax. North of Halifax, the highway turned to the northwest, following the Roanoke River to Roanoke Rapids. The highway crossed the river near Roanoke Rapids and continued northwest to the Virginia state line. Three sections of the highway were paved in 1924. These sections were between Wilmington and Burgaw, Warsaw and Goldsboro, and Fremont and Elm City. Much of the remaining route was either a gravel, sand, or topsoil road. Only the section between Roanoke Rapids and the Virginia border remained unimproved in 1924.

By 1926, NC 40 was rerouted north of Roanoke Rapids to run along an unimproved road to the northeast toward Pleasant Hill. The highway met NC 481 in Pleasant Hill and turned to the north until reaching the Virginia state line. Additionally, the highway was predominantly paved by 1926, with the exception of a segment between Halifax and Weldon, and between Roanoke Rapids and Pleasant Hill. Upon the creation of the United States Numbered Highway System, US 17-1 was assigned along the entirety of NC 40 between Wilmington and Virginia. By 1929, NC 40 was extended south from Wilmington to Carolina Beach. US 17-1 was not extended south alongside NC 40. US 17-1/NC 40 was rerouted north of Weldon in 1930. The new route followed the former alignment of NC 481 through Garysburg before running north to the Virginia state line. NC 481 was rerouted to follow the former alignment of NC 40 between NC 48 south of Rosemary to US 17-1/NC 40 in Pleasant Hill.

===Establishment===
US 117 was established in 1933 beginning at US 701/South Carolina Highway 38 (SC 38) to US 301 southwest of Wilson. US 17-1 was replaced by US 117 between Wilmington and Wilson, while US 301 replaced the highway between Wilson and Petersburg, Virginia. Beginning in Conway, the highway ran concurrently with SC 38 to the southeast, running through Socastee, South Carolina to Myrtle Beach. In Myrtle Beach, US 117 turned to the northeast to follow SC 49 until reaching the North Carolina state line. In North Carolina, the highway followed concurrently with NC 30 to Wilmington. The highway generally followed modern-day US 17, running through Shallotte, Supply and Bolivia before crossing a toll bridge into Wilmington. In Wilmington, the highway turned to the north to follow NC 40 along the former alignment of US 17-1. In Castle Hayne, US 117 used Old Bridgesite Road to cross the Northeast Cape Fear River. The highway continued north through Burgaw, Warsaw, and Goldsboro until reaching its northern terminus at US 301/NC 22 southwest of Wilson.

US 17 was rerouted to replace US 117 between Wilmington and Conway in 1935. As a result, the southern terminus of US 117 was moved to US 17 at Market Street in downtown Wilmington. The same year, NC 40 was decommissioned in favor of overlapping U.S. Highways. This marked the end of the US 117/NC 40 concurrency. US 117 was placed on a new routing between Wallace and Warsaw in 1940. The new routing ran through Wallace and Magnolia before entering Warsaw from the south. The former alignment of US 117 between Wallace and Kenansville became part of NC 11, while the section between Kenansville and Warsaw removed a concurrency with NC 24.

===Realignment and upgrades===
Between 1949 and 1953, US 117 was placed onto its modern-day crossing of the Northeast Cape Fear River north of Castle Hayne. In 1951, US 117 was rerouted onto a bypass along the western side of Goldsboro. The former alignment of US 117 along George Street, Ash Street, and William Street became US 117A. The highway was rerouted onto another bypass east of Burgaw in 1952. The new routing used the current alignment of US 117 around the downtown area. The former alignment through downtown Burgaw became US 117A. A bypass of Mount Olive and Calypso was constructed in 1960, with the former route becoming US 117 Business.

The southern terminus of US 117 was adjusted on September 11, 1969. The highway was removed from its routing along Third Street in downtown Wilmington. Instead, it was routed to cross the Isabel Stellings Holmes Bridge. Beyond the bridge US 117 turned to the south and ended at US 421/NC 133 in Brunswick County. In August 1973, the southern terminus was adjusted slightly to the north. Instead of turning south after crossing the Isabel Stellings Holmes Bridge, US 117 continued west along a former secondary road to US 421. The Mount Olive and Calypso bypass was extended north in November 1988, bypassing Dudley and Brogden to the west. US 117 was subsequently removed from its routing through the town and placed onto the new bypass, which is its current routing. US 117 Business decommissioned and the former route of US 117 between Calypso and Brogden became US 117 Alternate.

In February 2003, the northern terminus of US 117 was adjusted with the completion of a new freeway along the southside of Wilson. The pre-2003 alignment of US 117 at its northern terminus followed modern-day Dorthy Lane and Lattice Road to US 301. With the new construction, US 117 was rebuilt to turn to the west before reaching US 301. US 117 was subsequently routed concurrently with US 301 to the north until reaching US 264. At US 264, US 117 turned to the west, following the freeway to its new northern terminus at I-95. On March 19, 2003, the southern terminus of US 117 was moved from US 421 in Brunswick County to the Port of Wilmington. South of Castle Hayne, the highway was removed from its concurrency with NC 133 along Castle Hayne Road and the Isabel Stellings Holmes Bridge. US 117 was rerouted to run along College Road along a concurrency with NC 132. The highway then diverged from College Road at Shipyard Boulevard which it followed until reaching the port.

As early as 1993, North Carolina State Highway maps indicated a proposed freeway bypass of US 117 running between Goldsboro and Wilson. Upon its completion in September 2006, US 117 was rerouted to follow the new freeway. The US 117/US 301 concurrency was eliminated and the US 117/US 264 concurrency was shorted to . The former alignment of US 117 through Goldsboro, Pikeville, and Fremont became US 117 Alternate. Trucks larger than were not allowed to utilize the new freeway. The Surface Transportation Assistance Act specifies that trucks over in length can utilize only Interstate Highways and specific routes approved by the state. As a result, the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) sought approval from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) to sign the freeway as I-795. The original application to AASHTO detailed that US 117 would run concurrently with I-795 for its entire length. The request was initially denied, as the freeway connected with US 264 before connecting with I-95. North Carolina appealed the decision, and on October 12, 2007, the Federal Highway Administration designated I-795 along the freeway between Goldsboro and I-95. The highway was officially redesignated as I-795 on April 22, 2009. US 117 was shifted onto its former alignment through Goldsboro and Pikeville, ending at its modern-day northern terminus at US 301.

In July 2017, NCDOT awarded a contract to ST Wooten to build two interchanges along US 117 at Country Club Drive and Oberry Road. The project is part of a larger project to improve US 117 to Interstate Highway standards between I-40 and Goldsboro. The project was completed in the spring of 2020.
==Future==

NCDOT is planning to improve roughly of US 117 between I-40 in Sampson County and I-795 in Goldsboro to Interstate Highway standards. The segment is proposed as a southern extension of I-795 and is listed as Federal High Priority Corridor 81. As of December 19, 2020, four of the six project segments are currently funded in the 2020-2029 State Transportation Improvement Projects (STIP). Initial public meetings for the project occurred in November and December 2019. Right of way acquisition between Country Club Road and Genoa Road in Wayne County is expected to begin in 2024. In 2028, right of way acquisition will begin between Genoa Road and I-795.

The Wilmington Urban Area Metropolitan Planning Organization (WMPO) plans for four projects to occur along US 117 in New Hanover County. Project U-5792 and U-5881 would convert College Road (US 117/NC 132) to a freeway between I-40 and Oriole Drive. The project would include the construction of three new interchanges, at Kings Drive, US 74 (Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway), and Ringo Drive. Additionally, the interchange at US 17 Business (Market Street) would be redesigned. Construction of the US 74 interchange (Project U-5792) is expected to begin in 2026. The remainder of the project (Project U-5881) is expected to begin right of way acquisition in 2029. Project U-5704 would redesign the College Road (US 117/NC 132) and Oleander Drive (US 76) intersection and install access management between Shipyard Boulevard (US 117) and Wilshire Boulevard. The project is expected to begin right-of-way acquisition in 2029. A similar access management project (Project U-5702A) would install access management along College Road between Shipyard Boulevard and New Centre Drive.

==Special routes==
===Burgaw business loop===
U.S. Route 117 Business (US 117 Business) is a business route of US 117 which runs through the town of Burgaw. The highway runs for from US 117 southeast of downtown to US 117 north of downtown. US 117 Business shares a concurrency with NC 53 between Wilmington Street and the Jacksonville Highway. The special route was originally established in 1952 as US 117A when US 117 was rerouted east of downtown Burgaw. In 1960, NCDOT renumbered US 117A in Burgaw and Goldsboro to US 117 Business, establishing the current routing.

US 117 Business begins at an intersection with US 117 in southeastern Burgaw. From its southern terminus, the highway runs northwestward along Walker Street. Between Hayes Street and Satchwell Street, US 117 Business makes a slight curve, giving the highway a northern orientation. Entering into downtown Burgaw from the south, US 117 Business runs along the eastern side of the Pender County Courthouse. US 117 Business meets NC 53 at an intersection with Wilmington Street in downtown. Both highways run in concurrency to the northeast, exiting downtown Burgaw. At Bridgers Street, US 117 Business/NC 53 turns to the east to follow the street. East of Cowan Street, the business route makes a turn to the northeast. NC 53 diverges from US 117 Business at the Jacksonville Highway, marking the end of the concurrency through Burgaw. US 117 Business follows Timberly Lane to the north until reaching its northern terminus at US 117.

===Calypso Connector===

U.S. Route 117 Connector (US 117 Conn) is a spur route of US 117 running from I-40/NC 403 to US 117 in Calypso. Despite being signed as north–south, the highway physically travels in an east–west direction. The highway shares a brief concurrency on its southern end with NC 403. East of the intersection, US 117 Connector continues along a four-lane divided highway. It meets NC 50 at an intersection north of Faison. NC 50 is the last intersection along US 117 Connector until it meets US 117 north of Calypso.

The road which eventually became US 117 Connector was built in 1995 as a secondary road running from NC 403 to US 117. US 117 Connector was established on March 9, 2009, running from I-40 to US 117 north of Calypso. The new designation replaced the secondary road and created a concurrency with NC 403 along the southernmost of the highway.

===Calypso–Mount Olive business loop===

U.S. Route 117 Business (US 117 Business) was a business route of US 117 through the towns of Calypso and Mount Olive. The business route began at US 117 southwest of the central business area of Calypso. It then ran to the northeast, parallel with the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad to the located to the east. The highway exited Calypso to the northeast and traveled through rural Duplin County before crossing into Wayne County. US 117 Business entered the town of Mount Olive from the southwest and continued to run in a northeastern orientation along Breazeale Avenue. It intersected NC 55 in the northernmost town limits of Mount Olive. US 117 Business continued northeast for before meeting its northern terminus at US 117.

US 117 was originally routed through the towns of Calypso and Mount Olive. In 1960, US 117 was placed onto a bypass to the west of both towns. The former routing was designated as US 117 Business. The highway lasted from 1960 to 1988 when the US 117 bypass was extended north to Brogden. US 117 Business was decommissioned and US 117 Alternate was signed along the entirety of former US 117 between Calypso and Brogden.

===Calypso–Brogden alternate route===

U.S. Route 117 Alternate (US 117 Alt) is a alternate route of US 117 running through the towns of Calypso, Mount Olive, and Brogden. The highway travels from US 117 in Calypso to US 117 north of Brogden. US 117 Alternate was established on November 28, 1988. US 117 Alternate was a renumbering of US 117 Business through Calypso and Mount Olive, and a partial renumbering of US 117 between Mount Olive and Brogden. The routing of US 117 Alternate consists of the former routing of US 117 prior to the completion of a bypass around Calypso, Mount Olive, and Brogden.

The southern terminus of US 117 Alternate is located at an at-grade intersection with US 117 in Calypso. The highway runs northeast through Calypso along a two-lane highway, paralleling a CSX Transportation railroad to the east. Exiting Calypso to the northeast, the highway runs through a rural area between Calypso and Mount Olive. US 117 Alternate enters Mount Olive from the southwest, initially running through a residential area of the town. At Henderson Street, the highway widens to a five-lane undivided highway, with two lanes in each direction and a turning lane. US 117 Alternate meets NC 55 at an at-grade intersection in northern Mount Olive. North of Mount Olive, US 117 Alternate closely parallels US 117. The highway crosses through the western area of the unincorporated community of Dudley. In the center of the community, US 117 Alternate intersects Oberry Road and Sleepy Creek Road, which provide access to US 117. US 117 Alternate runs through western Brogden and exits the community to the northwest. Shortly before its northern terminus, the highway makes a slight turn to the north. US 117 Alternate reaches its northern terminus at US 117 between Brogden and Mar-Mac.

The southern terminus of US 117 Business is located at an intersection with US 13/US 117/NC 581 on the south side of Goldsboro. The highway travels north along George Street through a commercial area of southwestern Goldsboro. US 117 Business meets US 70 Business at an intersection with Ash Street. The highway turns onto Ash Street to run concurrently with US 70 Business to the east. In downtown Goldsboro, US 117 Business intersects Center Street at a roundabout. US 117 Business continues east for until reaching Williams Street. At the intersection, US 117 Business turns to follow Williams Street to the north, marking the end of the US 70 Business concurrency. The highway meets US 13/US 70/NC 111 at an interchange north of downtown Goldsboro. US 117 Business and NC 111 run concurrently for between the freeway and Patetown Road. The highway continues north of Patetown Road for until reaching its northern terminus at US 117.

The alignment of US 117 Business was once part of the route of US 117 prior to 1951. In 1951, US 117 was shifted onto a newly constructed bypass of Goldsboro, similar to the alignment it follows today. US 117A was established along the former routing through downtown Goldsboro. In 1960, US 117A was renumbered as US 117 Business alongside US 117A in Burgaw. Between 1960 and 1961, the highway shared a concurrency with NC 102 along George Street and Ash Street. NC 102 was decommissioned along much of its route west of Snow Hill, ending the concurrency.

===Goldsboro–Wilson alternate route===

U.S. Route 117 Alternate (US 117 Alternate) was a alternate route of US 117 between Goldsboro and Wilson, North Carolina. The southern terminus of US 117 Alternate was located at an intersection with US 117/US 13/NC 581 on the west side of Goldsboro. US 117 Alternate ran along a freeway to the northeast concurrently with US 13. The highway met US 70/US 70 Business at an interchange with Grantham Street in northwest Goldsboro. From the interchange, US 70 began to follow concurrently with US 13 and US 117 Alternate to the east. US 117 Alternate exited the freeway at an incomplete trumpet interchange marking the end of the US 13/US 70 concurrency. The highway continued northeast until meeting US 117 Business, where it made a slight turn onto Williams Street. US 117 Alternate followed Williams Street to the north, leaving Goldsboro. US 117 Alternate ran through the downtown areas of Pikeville on Goldsboro Street. Continuing north, US 117 Alternate passed through the downtown area of Fremont along Wilson Street. The alternate route ran concurrently with NC 222 between Main Street and Carolina Street in downtown Fremont. North of Fremont, US 117 Alternate passed the town of Black Creek to the west. It intersected US 301 south of Wilson, and turned north to run concurrently with US 301 for . US 117 Alternate met US 264 at an interchange south of Wilson. At the interchange, US 117 Alternate turned west to follow concurrently with US 264. After , US 117 Alternate met its northern terminus at an incomplete interchange with US 117/US 264. US 117/US 264 continued to the west toward I-95.

US 117 Alternate was established on September 7, 2006, as a renumbering of mainline US 117 through Goldsboro, Pikeville, and Fremont. At the time, US 117 was placed onto a freeway routing along modern-day I-795. The alternate route continued to exist between 2006 and 2009 while US 117 was routed along the freeway. In April 2009, I-795 was officially designated, and US 117 was removed from its freeway routing between Goldsboro and I-795. US 117 was rerouted to follow its pre-2006 routing, along US 117 Alternate between Goldsboro and US 301. As a result, the entire alternate route was decommissioned on March 9, 2009.

<text>U.S. Highway 218 (US 218) is an original United States Highway that was created in 1926. Although technically a spur of US 18, US 218 neither begins nor ends at US 18, but overlaps US 18 for near Charles City, Iowa. US 218 begins at U.S. 136 in downtown Keokuk and ends away at Interstate 35 (I-35) and US 14 at Owatonna, Minnesota. A large portion of US 218 in Iowa is part of the Avenue of the Saints, which connects St. Louis, Missouri, and Saint Paul, Minnesota.

==Route description==

===Iowa===

US 218 begins in downtown Keokuk at an intersection with US 136 and US 61 Business (US 61 Bus.) at Main and 7th streets. The highway heads north along Main Street with US 61 Bus. As they exit Keokuk, the business route ends at an intersection with the mainline US 61, which bypasses the city. US 218 and US 61 head north concurrently for a few miles before US 218 exits to the northwest; US 61 follows the Mississippi River north towards Fort Madison. US 218 travels northwesterly for almost along a two-lane road. As it approaches Donnellson, it meets up with and joins Iowa Highway 27 (Iowa 27), the Avenue of the Saints.

The two highways head north on a four-lane expressway. In Donnellson, they meet Iowa 2 at a diamond interchange. Further north, and east of Houghton, they intersect Iowa 16 at an at-grade intersection. Prior to crossing the Skunk River, the roadway angles to the northeast and a freeway bypass of Mount Pleasant begins. From the east, the highways are joined by US 34 and Iowa 163. The four highways loop around the city&#x27;s eastern side and begin traversing the northern side when US 34 and Iowa 163 split away to continue bypassing Mount Pleasant; US 218 and Iowa 27 continue north.

From Mount Pleasant it continues to the Iowa City area, which it bypasses to the south and west. The US 218/IA27 concurrency intersects with I-80, and continues north with I-380 towards Cedar Rapids. There US 218 diverges from IA 27 and joins the US30/US151 bypass of south Cedar Rapids. US 151 heads south at Exit 248, and the US 30/218 concurrency continues west for 15 miles, where US 30 continues on as a 4 lane highway and US 218 exits north as a rural 2 lane highway. US 218 heads northwest through Vinton and La Porte City before it reaches the Waterloo area.

Route 218 remains a 2 lane highway until it becomes a freeway right before US 20 and once again joins I-380 for a couple miles to downtown Waterloo. When I-380 ends, US 218 continues through downtown Waterloo and then to Cedar Falls, where it crosses the Cedar River. It continues northwest as a 4 lane highway through Waverly, Charles City, and Osage until the Minnesota state line.

===Minnesota===
US 218 enters the state at Lyle, in Mower County. It follows along the east side of the Iowa, Chicago, and Eastern Railroad line as it continues northward through farm fields. Southeast of Austin, US 218 angles northeastward to bypass the city, its former route following County Road 45 (CR 45) into town.

US 218 passes by the Austin Municipal Airport just before its interchange with I-90. The highway runs concurrently with I-90 for nearly through northern Austin. When US 218 departs from the Interstate and turns back north, it becomes a four-lane divided highway for a short distance. After its junction with State Highway 251 (MN 251), the highway angles north-northwestward again following the IC&amp;E rail line, this time on the west side of the tracks.

The highway enters Dodge County for less than a mile, then reaches Steele County, Blooming Prairie, and an eight-block-long concurrency with MN 30. It continues north-northwesterly after leaving Blooming Prairie, traveling through predominantly agricultural scenery. It passes by Oak Glen Lake before going through the unincorporated community of Bixby.

After passing through the unincorporated community of Pratt, US 218 meets US 14 at a folded diamond interchange. US 218 runs westward concurrently with US 14, while its historic route through downtown Owatonna continues ahead as CR 48. After an interchange with CR 45 (former US 65), US 14/US 218 passes by Kaplan&#x27;s Woods Park and reaches I-35, where US 218 ends.

Legally, the Minnesota section of US 218 is defined as Route 40 in Minnesota Statutes § 161.114(2).
==History==
In 1913, work on the road that is now US 218 was begun. At this time it was called the Red Ball Route. It was called this because the original route was marked with poles which had red balls, in diameter, mounted on each side. In 1920, the Minnesota portion of the route was designated as Constitutional Route 40, as part of the Babcock Amendment that established the Minnesota trunk highway system.

In Iowa, US 218 was extended from its previous southern terminus, at its intersection with US 30 in Benton County, in 1934 when US 161 was split and renamed. The former US 161 had extended from Dubuque, through Cedar Rapids, to Keokuk. After the split, the section of former US 161 from Dubuque to Cedar Rapids extended US 151 south, and the section of US 30 from the former terminus of US 218 to its intersection with the former US 161 in Cedar Rapids, along with the section of former US 161 from Cedar Rapids to Keokuk, extended US 218 south.

In 1965, US 218 was rerouted along bypasses of Austin, Minnesota and Owatonna, Minnesota, the latter following a route that would later become the US 14 bypass of that city as well.

In 1985, US 218 was bypassed around Iowa City and Coralville, joining I-380 at the I-80 interchange. US 218 to Cedar Rapids was replaced by Iowa 965.

==Future==
The Iowa Department of Transportation has plans to rebuild the AOTS interchange with I-80 and I-380/US 218/Iowa 27 in Coralville. As the Eastern Iowa region has grown, traffic has increased, and the current arrangement of the interchange with its cloverleaf ramps has been deemed unsafe. The Iowa DOT proposes to rebuild the interchange as a turbine interchange, which will eliminate weaving. The project is scheduled to begin in 2020.

<text>The Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Jazz Album was an award presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, to recording artists for works (songs or albums) containing quality contemporary jazz performances. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by The Recording Academy to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

Originally called the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Jazz Performance, the award was first presented to the Manhattan Transfer in 1992. From 1993 to 1994 the category was known as Best Contemporary Jazz Performance (Instrumental), from 1995 to 2000 the name changed to Best Contemporary Jazz Performance, and since 2001 the name of the category has been Best Contemporary Jazz Album. Until 2001, both albums and singles were eligible for this award. According to the category description guide for the 52nd Grammy Awards, the award is presented for albums containing &quot;at least 51% playing time of newly recorded contemporary jazz instrumental tracks&quot;. Beginning in 2001, award recipients included the producers, engineers, and/or mixers associated with the nominated work in addition to the recording artists.

As of 2011, Pat Metheny holds the record for the most wins in this category, with a total of six (five times with the Pat Metheny Group). Randy Brecker has received the award four times total, once along with his brother Michael as the duo known as Brecker Brothers. The group Béla Fleck and the Flecktones has received the award twice. American artists have been presented with the award more than any other nationality, though it has been presented once to Joe Zawinul, born in Austria. The group Yellowjackets holds the record for the most nominations without a win, with a total of seven. In 2012, the award was discontinued in a major overhaul of Grammy categories. From 2012, contemporary jazz recordings were shifted to the newly formed Best Jazz Instrumental Album category.

<text>The Grammy Award for Best Latin Jazz Album is an award presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, to recording artists for quality works (songs or albums) in the Latin jazz music genre. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

Originally called the Grammy Award for Best Latin Jazz Performance, the award was first presented to Arturo Sandoval in 1995. The name of the category was changed to Best Latin Jazz Album in 2001, the same year producers, engineers, and/or mixers associated with the winning work became award recipients in addition to the recording artists. According to the category description guide for the 52nd Grammy Awards, the award is presented to &quot;vocal or instrumental albums containing at least 51% playing time of newly recorded material&quot;, with the intent to recognize the &quot;blending&quot; of jazz music with Argentinian, Brazilian, Iberian-American, and Latin tango music. Beginning in 1998, members of the Latin Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences (LARAS) are eligible to vote in the Latin categories including Best Latin Jazz Album.

As of 2023, Chucho Valdés has the most wins in this category, with five. Arturo O’Farrill has won four, Paquito D&#x27;Rivera has won three, and two-time recipients include Sandoval, Eliane Elias, Charlie Haden, and Eddie Palmieri (once as a collaboration called The Brian Lynch/Eddie Palmieri Project). Since its inception, the award has been presented to musicians or groups originating from Brazil, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and the United States.

The award was not presented in 2012 as part of a major overhaul of Grammy categories; Latin jazz recordings were shifted to either the Best Jazz Instrumental Album or Best Jazz Vocal Album categories. However following protests and a lawsuit made by Latin jazz musicians Bobby Sanabria, Eugene Marlow, Ben Lapidus, and Mark Levine filed by attorney Roger Maldonado, the Recording Academy reinstated the category the following year 2013 for the 55th Grammy Awards.

<text>In mathematics, a handle decomposition of an &quot;m&quot;-manifold &quot;M&quot; is a union
formula_1
where each formula_2 is obtained from formula_3 by the attaching of formula_4-handles. A handle decomposition is to a manifold what a CW-decomposition is to a topological space—in many regards the purpose of a handle decomposition is to have a language analogous to CW-complexes, but adapted to the world of smooth manifolds. Thus an &quot;i&quot;-handle is the smooth analogue of an &quot;i&quot;-cell. Handle decompositions of manifolds arise naturally via Morse theory. The modification of handle structures is closely linked to Cerf theory.

==Motivation==
Consider the standard CW-decomposition of the &quot;n&quot;-sphere, with one zero cell and a single &quot;n&quot;-cell. From the point of view of smooth manifolds, this is a degenerate decomposition of the sphere, as there is no natural way to see the smooth structure of formula_5 from the eyes of this decomposition—in particular the smooth structure near the &quot;0&quot;-cell depends on the behavior of the characteristic map formula_6 in a neighbourhood of formula_7.

The problem with CW-decompositions is that the attaching maps for cells do not live in the world of smooth maps between manifolds. The germinal insight to correct this defect is the tubular neighbourhood theorem. Given a point &quot;p&quot; in a manifold &quot;M&quot;, its closed tubular neighbourhood formula_8 is diffeomorphic to formula_9, thus we have decomposed &quot;M&quot; into the disjoint union of formula_8 and formula_11 glued along their common boundary. The vital issue here is that the gluing map is a diffeomorphism. Similarly, take a smooth embedded arc in formula_11, its tubular neighbourhood is diffeomorphic to formula_13. This allows us to write formula_14 as the union of three manifolds, glued along parts of their boundaries: 1) formula_9 2) formula_13 and 3) the complement of the open tubular neighbourhood of the arc in formula_11. Notice all the gluing maps are smooth maps—in particular when we glue formula_13 to formula_9 the equivalence relation is generated by the embedding of formula_20 in formula_21, which is smooth by the tubular neighbourhood theorem.

Handle decompositions are an invention of Stephen Smale. In his original formulation, the process of attaching a &quot;j&quot;-handle to an &quot;m&quot;-manifold &quot;M&quot; assumes that one has a smooth embedding of formula_22. Let formula_23. The manifold formula_24 (in words, &quot;M&quot; union a &quot;j&quot;-handle along &quot;f&quot; ) refers to the disjoint union of formula_14 and formula_26 with the identification of formula_27 with its image in formula_28, i.e.,
formula_29
where the equivalence relation formula_30 is generated by formula_31 for all formula_32.

One says a manifold &quot;N&quot; is obtained from &quot;M&quot; by attaching &quot;j&quot;-handles if the union of &quot;M&quot; with finitely many &quot;j&quot;-handles is diffeomorphic to &quot;N&quot;. The definition of a handle decomposition is then as in the introduction. Thus, a manifold has a handle decomposition with only &quot;0&quot;-handles if it is diffeomorphic to a disjoint union of balls. A connected manifold containing handles of only two types (i.e.: 0-handles and &quot;j&quot;-handles for some fixed &quot;j&quot;) is called a handlebody.

==Terminology==

When forming &quot;M&quot; union a &quot;j&quot;-handle formula_26
formula_29

formula_35 is known as the attaching sphere.

formula_36 is sometimes called the framing of the attaching sphere, since it gives trivialization of its normal bundle.

formula_37 is the belt sphere of the handle formula_26 in formula_39.

A manifold obtained by attaching &quot;g&quot; &quot;k&quot;-handles to the disc formula_9 is an &quot;(m,k)&quot;-handlebody of genus &quot;g&quot; .

==Cobordism presentations==

A handle presentation of a cobordism consists of a cobordism &quot;W&quot; where formula_41 and an ascending union
formula_42
where is -dimensional, is &quot;m+1&quot;-dimensional, formula_43 is diffeomorphic to formula_44 and formula_45 is obtained from formula_46 by the attachment of &quot;i&quot;-handles. Whereas handle decompositions are the analogue for manifolds what cell decompositions are to topological spaces, handle presentations of cobordisms are to manifolds with boundary what relative cell decompositions are for pairs of spaces.

==Morse theoretic viewpoint==

Given a Morse function formula_47 on a compact boundaryless manifold &quot;M&quot;, such that the critical points formula_48 of &quot;f&quot; satisfy formula_49, and provided
formula_50
then for all &quot;j&quot;, formula_51 is diffeomorphic to formula_52 where &quot;I&quot;(&quot;j&quot;) is the index of the critical point formula_53. The &quot;index&quot; &quot;I(j)&quot; refers to the dimension of the maximal subspace of the tangent space formula_54 where the Hessian is negative definite.

Provided the indices satisfy formula_55 this is a handle decomposition of &quot;M&quot;, moreover, every manifold has such Morse functions, so they have handle decompositions. Similarly, given a cobordism formula_56 with formula_57 and a function formula_58 which is Morse on the interior and constant on the boundary and satisfying the increasing index property, there is an induced handle presentation of the cobordism &quot;W&quot;.

When &quot;f&quot; is a Morse function on &quot;M&quot;, -&quot;f&quot; is also a Morse function. The corresponding handle decomposition / presentation is called the dual decomposition.

==Some major theorems and observations==

* A Heegaard splitting of a closed, orientable 3-manifold is a decomposition of a &quot;3&quot;-manifold into the union of two &quot;(3,1)&quot;-handlebodies along their common boundary, called the Heegaard splitting surface. Heegaard splittings arise for &quot;3&quot;-manifolds in several natural ways: given a handle decomposition of a 3-manifold, the union of the &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot;-handles is a &quot;(3,1)&quot;-handlebody, and the union of the &quot;3&quot; and &quot;2&quot;-handles is also a &quot;(3,1)&quot;-handlebody (from the point of view of the dual decomposition), thus a Heegaard splitting. If the &quot;3&quot;-manifold has a triangulation &quot;T&quot;, there is an induced Heegaard splitting where the first &quot;(3,1)&quot;-handlebody is a regular neighbourhood of the &quot;1&quot;-skeleton formula_59, and the other &quot;(3,1)&quot;-handlebody is a regular neighbourhood of the dual &quot;1&quot;-skeleton.
* When attaching two handles in succession formula_60, it is possible to switch the order of attachment, provided formula_61, i.e.: this manifold is diffeomorphic to a manifold of the form formula_62 for suitable attaching maps.
* The boundary of formula_24 is diffeomorphic to formula_28 surgered along the framed sphere formula_36. This is the primary link between surgery, handles and Morse functions.
* As a consequence, an &quot;m&quot;-manifold &quot;M&quot; is the boundary of an &quot;m+1&quot;-manifold &quot;W&quot; if and only if &quot;M&quot; can be obtained from formula_66 by surgery on a collection of framed links in formula_66. For example, it&#x27;s known that every &quot;3&quot;-manifold bounds a &quot;4&quot;-manifold (similarly oriented and spin &quot;3&quot;-manifolds bound oriented and spin &quot;4&quot;-manifolds respectively) due to René Thom&#x27;s work on cobordism. Thus every 3-manifold can be obtained via surgery on framed links in the &quot;3&quot;-sphere. In the oriented case, it&#x27;s conventional to reduce this framed link to a framed embedding of a disjoint union of circles.
* The H-cobordism theorem is proven by simplifying handle decompositions of smooth manifolds.

<text>U.S. Route 119 (US 119) is a spur of US 19. It is a north–south route (on a northeast–southwest alignment) that was an original United States highway of 1926. It is Corridor G of the Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS) east of US 23 and KY 80 in Kentucky to Interstate 64 at Charleston, West Virginia.

==Route description==
=== Kentucky===
In Kentucky, US 119 is a two- and four-lane highway running from Pineville at U.S. Route 25E to the West Virginia state line at South Williamson. It follows the Cumberland River past Harlan to near the source of the river&#x27;s Poor Fork, crosses Pine Mountain south of Whitesburg, then follows a meandering course along the mountain to Jenkins, where it joins US 23 and turns north to Pikeville. Just north of Pikeville it turns east to South Williamson, where it crosses the Tug Fork of the Big Sandy River into Williamson, West Virginia.

From Pikeville to US 23 (Country Music Highway) at Jenkins, it is part of ADHS Corridor F. In its concurrency from Jenkins north to Pikeville, where it heads east toward West Virginia, it is part of Corridor B. From US 23/KY 80 at Pikeville eastward towards the state line, it is part of Corridor G.

===West Virginia===
U.S. Route 119 enters West Virginia from Kentucky as unsigned ADHS Corridor G, a four-lane limited-access highway stretching from Williamson to Charleston. The earliest segment of Corridor G to open was in 1972 and was finished in 1997. Formerly, US 119 was a typical two-lane mountain highway. Old US 119 now comprises all or parts of US 52, WV 44, WV 10, WV 17, WV 85, WV 3, WV 94 and WV 61.

The US route becomes a mostly two-lane highway north of Charleston, having functionally been replaced by Interstate 79. Compared to its replacement, US 119 takes a rather winding course. A trip from the Charleston area to the Morgantown area (I-79/US 119 Exit #1 to I-68 Exit #1) is via I-79 and via US 119. The travel time is about double taking US 119, over 4 hours instead of about 2 hours.

From Charleston, US 119 heads roughly east along the Elk River to Clendenin, where it turns north for to Spencer. At Spencer, it begins to head east with US 33 for . Along the way, it passes through Glenville and Weston, where it intersects parent route US 19 and replacement I-79. From I-79 to WV 20 at Buckhannon, US 33/US 119 follow Corridor H.

At Buckhannon, US 119 again turns north — first with WV 20 then by itself as it travels to Philippi. At Philippi it joins with US 250 for . From there, US 119 heads on its own through Grafton and towards Morgantown.

Just south of Morgantown, US 119 intersects Interstate 68&#x27;s Exit #1, immediately east of its end at I-79. US 119 then enters downtown Morgantown, again meeting with US 19. It leaves town via the narrow and winding North Willey Street and congested Mileground.

Just after the Mileground, US 119 intersects with the Monongalia County Route 857 connector to I-68 Exit #7, which effectively allows through traffic to bypass Morgantown. US 119 finally turns north to enter Pennsylvania near Point Marion. The Hamilton Farm Petroglyphs are along this section. Much of this last stretch of US 119 heading towards Uniontown, Pennsylvania is already bypassed by traffic using I-68, CR 857, and PA 857 (or the tolled Mon-Fayette Expressway). While this alternate route is longer, it has a better alignment and is faster to travel.

===Pennsylvania===

US 119 travels through Connellsville, Greensburg, and Punxsutawney, and bypasses Uniontown and Indiana. There are numerous other boroughs and villages along its route in the Keystone State.

The southern entrance of US 119 is at the West Virginia state line one-half mile south of Point Marion. The northern terminus is at US 219 two miles (3 km) south of DuBois, Pennsylvania.

US 119&#x27;s control cities include Morgantown, West Virginia, Uniontown, Connellsville, New Stanton (for northbound traffic only), Greensburg, Blairsville, Indiana, Punxsutawney, and DuBois.

==History==

=== U.S. Route 123 ===

In 1929 U.S. Route 23, which then ended at Jenkins, KY, was extended to Pineville. The following year this section was renumbered to U.S. Route 123, to allow US 23 to be extended in a different direction (towards Kingsport TN). In 1934 US 119 was extended from Morgantown WV into Kentucky, joining US 123 at Jenkins; US 123 was then renumbered to US 119.
=== Kentucky===
Hwy 119 in Kentucky was originally a series of two-lane roads paralleling Pine Mountain that connected Pineville to Baxter (just north of Harlan) and then headed northeast through Cumberland, Whitesburg, and Pikeville en route to West Virginia.

Starting in the 1970s, there were a number of projects that widened or replaced sections of the road. In most places, the original route has been largely abandoned, instead cutting through the mountain to provide a much wider and straighter route. Small segments of the original route are still in existence as access roads to communities that predate the expansion. In Loyall the original route is known as Hwy 413, and this parallels Hwy 119 heading northeast until it reaches the community of Rosspoint. During this stretch in Baxter, Hwy 119 also briefly combines with U.S. Route 421, which then splits off and heads north across Pine Mountain. In Rosspoint, the original route of Hwy 119 is designated as Hwy 522. Hwy 522 parallels Hwy 119 all the way to Cumberland, where the final stretch of original highway is called Kingdom Come Dr. before merging with Hwy 119 just south of the Harlan County/Letcher County border.

From this point until the base of Pine Mountain (unofficially called Whitesburg Mountain), the highway is largely unchanged from its original route. On the mountain, Hwy 119 has recently been widened in a number of places in order to make it safer for trucking traffic.

Across the mountain in Whitesburg, Hwy 119 turns northeast. South of Jenkins, Hwy 119 merges with U.S. Route 23 until Pikeville, where it splits off and heads northeast to the West Virginia border.

In 2007, a 6-mile stretch of Hwy 119 northeast of Pikeville, was expanded and improved by cutting through the mountain, once again abandoning the original route which is now known as the Zebulon Hwy. and Bent Branch Rd. Past this point, Hwy 119 follows its original route until exiting Kentucky at South Williamson.

===West Virginia===
The routing of US 119 south of Charleston changed drastically with the opening of Corridor G from 1972 to 1997.

The original routing southeast of the capital was WV 61 to Marmet, where it took WV 94 southwest to Racine. From Racine to Danville, it followed today&#x27;s WV 3 and onward to Madison. From Madison south to Logan, it followed today&#x27;s WV 17.

South of Logan to Mountain View, it followed WV 44. At Mountain View, it intersected US 52 and traveled concurrently with it to the northwest, to Williamson, where it entered Kentucky.

Corridor G is a highway in Kentucky and West Virginia. It is part of the Appalachian Development Highway System, encompassing US 119 for its length. At the southern terminus of Corridor G at Corridor B (US 23/US 460/KY 80) near Pikeville, Kentucky, traffic can continue along Corridor B towards Pikeville and Jenkins, where one can pick up Corridor F (US 119) or proceed south on Corridor B (US 23) into Virginia. At the northern terminus at Interstate 64 in Charleston, West Virginia, one can pick up Interstate 77 and Interstate 79, along with the West Virginia Turnpike.

The Hatfield–McCoy Trails are an ATV and mountain biking network of trails throughout southwest West Virginia. Three trail heads branch off from various secondary routes accessible from Corridor G.

=== Kentucky ===

In 1974, the first segment of Corridor G was completed from KY 292 (2nd St.) at South Williamson south to KY 199 at Huddy. This was a four-lane divided highway that contained mountable medians and jersey barriers, with a mix of state route and driveway access. This is especially evident as US 119 cuts through the center of Belfry and South Williamson. Several years later, a segment of four-lane US 119 along Buckley Creek opened from Corridor B/US 23/US 460/KY 80 north of Pikeville to what is now KY 1426 northeast of Pikeville.

In 1997, a section of US 119 was relocated on new alignment from KY 3154 (Meathouse Fork Rd.) at Canada east to KY 199 at Huddy. Two years later, a section of US 119 was relocated on new alignment from east of Meta to KY 3154 at Canada. This involved extensive highwall construction at Bent Mountain and Canada Knob.

The final segment of Corridor G in Kentucky to be completed was from the KY 1426 intersection north of Pikeville east to Scott Fork east of Meta. This segment required the construction of three twin steel-box girder bridges at Johns Creek (KY 194) near Bevins Branch, Winn Branch (Winn Branch Road), and Raccoon Creek (KY 1441). This also includes a modified diamond interchange at what will be old US 119 1/2-mile east of KY 1426 at Zebulon.

On June 30, 2006, the &quot;Pinson Family Bridge&quot; was dedicated. It crosses Raccoon Creek and KY 1441. This twin steel-box girder bridge is more than long and is the only example of its kind in Kentucky. The girders were chosen because of the curvature within the bridge structure; each girder is completely hollow and it features a . clearance on the interior.

On December 6, 2006, a segment of Corridor G opened from the KY 1426 intersection north of Pikeville east to the KY 194 (Johns Creek) interchange. The last segment to open is from KY 194 north to Scott Fork. That segment was opened in March 2008.

=== West Virginia ===

The first segments of Corridor G to open was in 1972. During that year, a Mingo County segment from Myrtle and Belo (MP 13) to the Logan County line near Holden opened. Segments of this were opened originally as a &quot;super-two&quot; since WV 65 was being destroyed; it was critical that the old roadway be removed before the highway was expanded to four-lanes.

In 1973, a lengthy segment opened to traffic from Godby Heights south of Chapmanville (MP 13) to MP 4 in Boone County. This was followed a year later by a segment near Madison from MP 9.37 to MP 13 in Boone County. In 1975, the segment from MP 4 to MP 9.37 in Boone County was opened to traffic. At this time, the connection to Interstate 64 in Charleston also opened to traffic from Oakwood Road. This included the flyover ramp from US 119 to the Interstate 64 interchange.

In 1977, a Mingo County segment from Nolan (MP 7.45) at US 52 to Myrtle (MP 13) opened to traffic.

The next segment to open would come in 1982, when a Boone, Lincoln, and Kanawha County segment opened to traffic from Julian (MP 17) to the WV 601 interchange in South Charleston (MP 11). The segment between the WV 601 interchange to Oakwood Road in Charleston would be completed in 1986; it formerly utilized Oakhurst and Oakwood Roads.

In 1989, a segment from MP 13 to Julian (MP 17) in Boone County opened. In 1992, a new Tug Fork crossing at Williamson was completed. Formerly, Corridor G traffic from Kentucky had to cross into downtown Williamson and pick up US 119 into West Virginia.

The last segment of Corridor G in West Virginia to be completed was from the Tug Fork crossing at Williamson north to US 52 near Nolan. This nine-mile (14 km) segment was completed in 1997.

<text>U.S. Route 219 (US 219) is a spur of US 19. It runs for from West Seneca, New York, at an interchange with Interstate 90 (I-90) to Rich Creek, Virginia, intersecting at US 460. US 219 is found (from north to south) in New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, and Virginia. Much of the Route in West Virginia follows the old Indian warpath known as the Seneca Trail (Great Indian Warpath).

==Route description==

===Virginia===

US 219 starts in Rich Creek at US 460, and heads northeast to the West Virginia state line. Until the early 1980s, US 219 continued southwest with US 460 from Rich Creek, re-entering West Virginia to end at US 19 in Bluefield. It now only runs in Virginia, and no longer connects to its parent route US 19. 

US 219 was initially added to the state highway system in the early 1920s as State Route 231. It became State Route 216 in the 1928 renumbering and State Route 124 in the 1933 renumbering, finally becoming part of the extended US 219 (along with State Route 8, now US 460, west of Rich Creek) in the late 1930s.

===West Virginia===
US 219 enters West Virginia in Peterstown at the split of US 219 and WV 12. US 219 then heads northeast into Union. US 219 continues through Greenbrier County running through the towns of Ronceverte, Lewisburg, where it intersects US 60, and Falling Spring. US 219 continues north into Pocahontas County and through the towns of Hillsboro and Marlinton. US 219 runs north into Randolph County and begins its dual certification with US 250. They both serve the towns of Huttonsville, Mill Creek, Beverly, and Elkins, where US 33 joins the concurrency. US 219 splits from US 33 and US 250 just north of Elkins. US 219 continues through the town of Montrose until it enters Tucker County. From here, US 219 runs through the towns of Parsons and Thomas. US 219 heads north into rural Preston County and exits West Virginia into Garrett County, Maryland.

===Maryland===
US 219 enters Maryland near Backbone Mountain on the West Virginia border, crosses US 50 and enters the town of Oakland. It crosses Maryland Route 135 and Maryland Route 39 in Oakland, before passing Deep Creek Lake. After traveling through Accident it intersects Interstate 68 east of Friendsville, providing access to Morgantown, West Virginia, Frostburg and Cumberland. US 219 runs concurrently with I-68 at Exit 14A and exits I-68 at Exit 22. US 219 crosses the Mason–Dixon line, the Pennsylvania border, south of Salisbury, Pennsylvania.

===Pennsylvania===
From near Grantsville, Maryland north to Ebensburg, Pennsylvania, US 219 is Corridor N of the Appalachian Development Highway System. From Meyersdale, Pennsylvania to just south of Carrolltown, Pennsylvania, US 219 is a limited-access highway. A new 11-mile limited-access segment from Meyersdale to Somerset opened to traffic in the late fall of 2018. On August 9, 2007, Pennsylvania State Transportation Secretary Allen D. Biehler unveiled four signs along US Route 219 that dedicated the route from Maryland to Cambria County, Pennsylvania as the &quot;Flight 93 Memorial Highway&quot;. From Carrolltown US 219 runs largely as a two-lane road to DuBois, Pennsylvania, through which it runs as Brady Street, and then returns to a two-lane road after a junction with Interstate 80. US 219 runs directly through the towns of Brockway, Ridgway, and Johnsonburg before reaching Wilcox, where PA Route 321 splits and heads for the borough of Kane. US 219 continues north as a two-lane road until reaching Bradford, where it becomes a limited-access highway and remains so until reaching the New York border.

===New York===

US 219 enters Western New York from Pennsylvania south of the Hamlet of Limestone in the Town of Carrollton in Cattaraugus County. Proceeding northward, the highway splits into the main route and a &quot;business route&quot; that follows the original main route. The main route merges with Interstate 86/New York State Route 17 at Exit 23 north of Limestone and splits from I-86/NY 17 at Exit 21 in the city of Salamanca. The business route crosses the Allegheny River and the Southern Tier Expressway and joins New York State Route 417 to the City of Salamanca. Separating from NY 417, the business route rejoins with the main US 219 and turns northward through the rest of Cattaraugus County, passing through Peth, Great Valley, Ellicottville, and Ashford Hollow before crossing the Cattaraugus Creek and entering Erie County. About 4 miles south of Springville, New York, US 219 becomes a divided, limited-access highway. As such, it continues north through half of the county, terminating at exit 55 of the New York State Thruway (Interstate 90) near the west town line of West Seneca south of the City of Buffalo. Before joining the Thruway, US 219 runs parallel to it for about one mile (1.6 km). The interchange is set up as such that drivers can exit and re-enter the Thruway via US 219 without leaving the expressway.

<text>The Funday Times was a section of the UK &quot;Sunday Times.&quot; It was intended mainly for children, and included several comic strips, Launched in 1989, it originally featured adult cartoons like &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; but quickly dropped them in favour of more child-friendly fare such as &quot;Asterix&quot;.

It also included reviews of various toys and songs, interviews with celebrities, including Will Smith, Gail Emms and Matt Groening, and interesting events coming up during the week.

== Publication history==
The &quot;Funday Times&quot; website was established on 3 September 1997, and closed down on 5 January 2007.

The last printed edition of the &quot;Funday Times&quot; was published on Sunday 12 March 2006. After that date, it was only available online. The print edition of the &quot;Funday Times&quot; ran for nearly 20 years before it was discontinued. The website mostly concentrated on features and games, although there were comic strips on the website that were originally in the printed version.

The &quot;Funday Times&quot; returned for a one-off special on 1 April 2011 to promote the &quot;Rio&quot; movie. Since then, the section has returned sporadically with themed issues to promote newly released children&#x27;s films.

<text>U.S. Route 319 (US 319) is a spur of US 19. It runs for from US 98 at the foot of the John Gorrie Memorial Bridge across from downtown Apalachicola, Florida to US 1/SR 4 in Wadley, Georgia, through the Panhandle of Florida and the southern portion of Georgia.

==Route description==
===Florida===

The route starts as a two-lane highway at the eastern end of US 98&#x27;s bridge over the Apalachicola River near the John Gorrie Bridge in Apalachicola, Florida, and is concurrent with US 98 from its starting point. After crossing the East Bay portion of Apalachicola Bay via the John Gorrie Bridge, US 319 runs along the Gulf coast of Florida&#x27;s Panhandle to Carabelle in Franklin County, and departs the coast, and its concurrency with US 98, about halfway between Carrabelle and Bald Point State Park, in a north direction through Sopchoppy in Wakulla County.

In Sopchoppy, the route angles east, briefly meets up with US 98 once more, before parting ways again and running north through Crawfordville, where it receives the FDOT maintenance designation of State Road 369, into Tallahassee in Leon County. US 319 meets SR 61 just south of Tallahassee, marking the northern end of SR 369, where it becomes a 4-lane divided highway, which turns into 6 lanes as the route meets SR 263 and forms part of the southern and eastern portion of the Capital Circle around Tallahassee. US 319 has the unsigned SR 261 designation between State Road 363/Woodville Highway and Capital Circle&#x27;s eastern terminus at State Road 61/Thomasville Road. US 319/SR 61 has a complex interchange with I-10 at exit 203 before heading northeast out of the Tallahassee area. US 319 again becomes a 4-lane divided highway at its intersection with County Road 0342 about from I-10, and runs to the state line with Georgia.

===Georgia===
The route bypasses Grady County and enters Thomas County co-signed with SR 35 at the intersection of SR 93 and travels northeast in the direction of Thomasville in Thomas County, where the route forms the western and northern perimeter around Thomasville. US 319 then continues northeast, passes through Coolidge, and crosses into Colquitt County, running as a bypass around the east of Moultrie. The route crosses into Tift County and intersects with I-75 just before running through Tifton.

In Ocilla, US 319/SR 35 is concurrent with SR 32, Half a mile later, US 319 turns north and is concurrent with US 129 and SR 35 reach its terminus. US 319 And US 129 head into Ben Hill County and through Fitzgerald, where it splits from US 129 and first heads east, and then north through the northwestern corner of Coffee County, where it meets up and is co-signed with US 441, and crosses the Ocmulgee River into Telfair County, Georgia at Jacksonville, Georgia and on into McRae-Helena. After briefly traversing the western corner of Wheeler County and eastern corner of Dodge County, US 319 continues north through Laurens County, crossing I-16 just before heading into and through Dublin and East Dublin, where US 441 splits off.

Continuing northeast, the route heads into Johnson County, runs through Wrightsville, and heads into southern Jefferson County, where it turns east in Bartow, before meeting its northern terminus at US 1 and SR 4 in Wadley.

US 319 from Tifton to the Florida State Line is a GRIP corridor.

===National Highway System===
The following portions of US 319 and SR 35 are part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation&#x27;s economy, mobility, and defense:
*US 319/SR 35:
**From its southern terminus in Apalachicola to just north of the concurrency with US 82/SR 520 just east of Tifton
*US 319 only:
**From the southern end of the SR 32 concurrency in Ocilla to about Fitzgerald
**The entire length of the US 441 concurrency, from south of Jacksonville to Dublin.

==History==

===Florida===
The entire length of US 319 in Franklin County was designated as &quot;Blue Star Memorial Highway&quot; by the Florida State Legislature in 1957.

The section of US 319 that is co-signed with US 98 and SR 30 in Medart in Wakulla County was designated as &quot;Agnes Morrison Memorial Highway&quot; by the Florida State Legislature in 1961.

From Kinhega Drive, about north of its intersection with I-10 in Leon County, to the Georgia state line, US 319 and SR 61 were designated as &quot;Kate Ireland Parkway&quot; by the Florida State Legislature in 1992.

===Georgia===
US 319 does not make an appearance on Georgia road maps until October 1937, when the spur from the Florida state line to Thomasville is shown, co-signed with SR 3. Prior to October 1937, US 19 appears as the designation of this section of the route.

In July 1941, US 319 was extended from Thomasville, and ran through Moultrie, following what was signed as SR 35 at the time, to Cordele, co-signed with the current route taken by SR 33 from Moultrie. Since late in 1946, US 319 follows its current route.

The section of US 319 that forms the Thomasville Bypass was designated as &quot;Will Watt Parkway&quot; in 1996 after a prominent resident of Thomasville.

The section of US 319 that forms the east bypass around Moultrie in Colquitt County was designated as &quot;Veterans Parkway&quot; in 2002.

==Major intersections==



























==Special routes==
===Thomasville connector===
State Route 35 Connector (SR 35 Conn.) is a connector route for SR 35 in the northeastern part of the Thomasville area. Its southern terminus is at US 19, US 84, SR 3, SR 38, and SR 300 in the northeastern part of Thomasville. Its northern terminus is at US 319/SR 35 northeast of the city. This highway used to be US 319 Bus./SR 35 Bus. in the city.



===Thomasville business loop===
State Route 35 Business (SR 35 Bus.) was a business route for SR 35 that served the downtown area of Thomasville. The route was decommissioned in 2007.
===Moultrie business loop===

U.S. Route 319 Business (US 319 Bus.) is a business route for US 319 that travels through the central portion of Moultrie. It is concurrent with SR 33 for its entire length.

US 319 Bus. begins at an intersection with US 319/SR 35 (Veterans Parkway) and SR 33 (Pavo Road) in the south-central part of Moultrie. US 319 Bus. and SR 33 travel concurrently as South Main Street to the north-northwest and immediately curve to the north-northeast. An intersection with 32nd Avenue SE leads to Colquitt Regional Medical Center. One block later, an intersection with 31st Avenue leads to the hospital, as well. Just past an intersection with the eastern terminus of Hugh Bannister Drive, they begin a curve back to the north-northwest. Just south of an intersection with the northern terminus of Lower Meigs Road, the highways curve back to the north-northeast. An intersection with 11th Avenue leads to the Jim Buck Goff Recreation Complex. At 4th Avenue, the northbound lanes of US 319 and SR 33 turn right and travel to the east, while the southbound lanes stay on South Main Street. South Main Street remains a two-way street until 2nd Avenue SE. One block later, they turn left onto 1st Street SE and continue their northern direction. On the southeastern corner of the intersection with 2nd Avenue SE lies the main office for Southwest Georgia Bank.

One block later, at 1st Avenue SE, they intersect the eastbound lanes of SR 37. Just north of this intersection, they pass the Colquitt County Courthouse. One block later, they intersect the westbound lanes of SR 37 (East Central Avenue). On the northeastern corner of this intersection lies the annex for the county courthouse. Here, 1st Street SE changes to 1st Street NE. At this same point, South Main Street changes back to a two-way street. At an intersection with 1st Avenue NE, 1st Street NE becomes a two-way street. On the southwestern corner of an intersection with 2nd Avenue NE lies the municipal building. On the northeaster corner lies the annex for the municipal building. Just north of 9th Avenue NE, they travel on a bridge over some railroad tracks of Norfolk Southern Railway (NS). North of Sylvester Drive, they have a roundabout with Sylvester Highway and the southbound lanes of US 319 Bus./SR 33. Just south of this roundabout is a sign for SR 33 south, even though it is actually still on Main Street. In fact, there is a directional sign in the roundabout that says that 1st Street NE is SR 33 south. The reunited lanes travel to the northeast. They cross over Okapilco Creek before they meet their northern terminus, an intersection with US 319/SR 35/SR 133 (Veterans Parkway/Tifton Highway). Here, SR 33 turns left onto East Bypass, concurrent with SR 133.

Between 2nd Avenue NE and 4th Avenue NW, they pass the U.S. post office for the city. Whereas the northbound lanes travel on a bridge over the NS line, the southbound lanes actually meet them at a railroad crossing. Just south of Sylvester Drive, the southbound lanes have an intersection with SR 111 (West Bypass NW). SR 111 does not meet the northbound lanes, or vice versa. Just north of Sylvester Drive, northbound Main Street has signage that indicates that it is northbound US 319 Bus./SR 33, although they are actually on 1st Street NE.

The entire length of US 319 Bus., and the portion of SR 33 concurrent with it, is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation&#x27;s economy, mobility, and defense.




===Tifton connector route===

State Route 35 Connector (SR 35 Conn.) is a connector route for SR 35 that exists on the southwestern edge of the city limits of Tifton. It connects US 319/SR 35 to Interstate 75 (I-75). This interchange with I-75 is on the Tifton–Phillipsburg line. SR 35 Conn. is known as Old Omega Road for its entire length.

<text>The Howland will forgery trial (&quot;Robinson v. Mandell&quot;) was a U.S. court case in 1868 where businesswoman Henrietta &quot;Hetty&quot; Howland Robinson, who would later become the richest woman in America, contested the validity of the will of her grandaunt, Sylvia Ann Howland.

According to Sylvia Howland&#x27;s will, half of her $2 million estate () would go to various charities and entities, the rest would be in a trust for Hetty Robinson. Robinson challenged the will&#x27;s validity by producing an earlier will that left the entire estate to her, and which included a clause invalidating any subsequent wills. The case was ultimately decided against Robinson after the court ruled that the clause invalidating future wills and Sylvia&#x27;s signature to it were forgeries.

It is famous for the forensic use of mathematics by Benjamin Peirce as an expert witness.

==History==
Sylvia Ann Howland died in 1865, leaving roughly half her fortune of some 2 million dollars () to various legatees, with the residue to be held in trust for the benefit of Robinson, Howland&#x27;s niece. The remaining principal was to be distributed to various beneficiaries on Robinson&#x27;s death.

Robinson produced an earlier will, leaving her the whole estate outright. To the will was attached a second and separate page, putatively seeking to invalidate any subsequent wills. Howland&#x27;s executor, Thomas Mandell, rejected Robinson&#x27;s claim, insisting that the second page was a forgery, and Robinson sued.

In the ensuing case of &quot;Robinson v. Mandell&quot;, Charles Sanders Peirce testified that he had made pairwise comparisons of 42 examples of Howland&#x27;s signature, overlaying them and counting the number of downstrokes that overlapped. Each signature featured 30 downstrokes and he concluded that, on average, 6 of the 30 overlapped, 1 in 5. Benjamin Peirce, Charles&#x27; father, showed that the number of overlapping downstrokes between two signatures also closely followed the binomial distribution, the expected distribution if each downstroke was an independent event. When the admittedly genuine signature on the first page of the contested will was compared with that on the second, all 30 downstrokes coincided, suggesting that the second signature was a tracing of the first.

Benjamin Peirce then took the stand and asserted that, given the independence of each downstroke, the probability that all 30 downstrokes should coincide in two genuine signatures was formula_1. That is one in 2,666,000,000,000,000,000,000, in the order of magnitude of sextillions. He went on to observe:

So vast improbability is practically an impossibility. Such evanescent shadows of probability cannot belong to actual life. They are unimaginably less than those least things which the law cares not for. ... The coincidence which has occurred here must have had its origin in an intention to produce it. It is utterly repugnant to sound reason to attribute this coincidence to any cause but design.

The court ruled that Robinson&#x27;s testimony in support of Howland&#x27;s signature was inadmissible as she was a party to the will, thus having a conflict of interest. The statistical evidence was not called upon in judgment.

The case is one of a series of attempts to introduce mathematical reasoning into the courts. &quot;People v. Collins&quot; is a more recent example.

<text>U.S. Route 221 (US 221) is a spur of U.S. Route 21. It travels from Perry, Florida, at US 19/US 98/US 27 Alternate to Lynchburg, Virginia, at US 29 Business (Lynchburg Expressway). It travels through the states of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. It travels through the cities of Valdosta, Georgia; Spartanburg, South Carolina; Marion, North Carolina; Roanoke, Virginia; and Lynchburg, Virginia.

==Route description==

===Florida===
U.S. Route 221 originates just south of the city of Perry, with its southern terminus intersecting with the cosigned U.S. Route 19 U.S. Route 98 and U.S. Route 27 Alternate, taking hidden SR 55 with it away from US 19. It continues through the city of Perry and intersects Interstate 10 and U.S. Route 90 in rural Madison County before crossing into Georgia.

===Georgia===

U.S. Route 221 runs through the cities of Quitman, Valdosta, Lakeland, Pearson, and Douglas in southern Georgia.

In Quitman, it joins U.S. Route 84 (cosigned Georgia State Route 38) to Valdosta. From Valdosta to Douglas, it joins with Georgia State Route 31. It also joins with Georgia State Route 135 and State Route 56. From Pearson to Douglas, it joins with U.S. Route 441 as a four-lane highway, which was completed in 2000.

In Douglas, U.S. Route 221 runs as the eastern part of Bowens Mill Rd. and will be widened in the future. It passes through Hazelhurst, Mount Vernon and Soperton before crossing Interstate 16, then later joins up with U.S. Route 1 and Georgia State Route 4 after passing through Louisville. After going through Wrens, it splits off to the north, cosigned with Georgia State Route 47 and passes through Harlem before crossing Interstate 20 /Georgia State Route 402 approximately 20 miles west of Augusta. Shortly before crossing into South Carolina, Georgia State Route 150 merges with Route 221 at the Pollards Corner intersection as Georgia 47 turns away. The passage into South Carolina takes place on top of the J. Strom Thurmond Dam, which forms the southern shore of Lake Strom Thurmond.

===South Carolina===
U.S. Route 221 enters South Carolina in rural McCormick County at the southeastern edge of Lake Strom Thurmond. It continues north and northwestward to the town of McCormick. From McCormick, it continues northerly to the city of Greenwood.

From Greenwood, U.S. Route 221 continues northeasterly to the city of Waterloo, South Carolina. U.S. Truck Route 221 bypasses the city of Laurens on the east side. It continues northerly and intersects Interstate 385 in rural Laurens County and proceeds to intersect Interstate 26 in rural Spartanburg County.

U.S. Route 221 continues through the center of the city of Spartanburg before intersecting Interstate 85 just north of the city. It continues to the city of Chesnee before exiting the state in a rural area of Cherokee County. The southern terminus of U.S. Alternate Route 221 intersects the main route in the city of Chesnee and exits the state a few miles to the east of the main route.

===North Carolina===
US 221 is a major highway in Western North Carolina. It runs through the cities and towns of Rutherfordton, Marion, Blowing Rock, Boone, and Jefferson. The highway is predominantly two-lane, while four-lane in Marion, Blowing Rock, and Boone. The section from the U.S. Route 321 interchange just east of Boone and into Jefferson in Ashe county is now a divided, four-lane controlled-access road, making this section a much more pleasant and scenic one. Two sections of the highway can be considered challenging and twisty: 13-mile stretch between Linville and Blowing Rock, and a 21-mile stretch between Jefferson and Twin Oaks.

U.S. Route 221 has one Alternate (continuing from South Carolina) and two Business Routes (in Marion and Jefferson). It intersects two major highways: U.S. Route 74 near Rutherfordton and I-40 near Marion; and also intersects with the Blue Ridge Parkway four times.

===Virginia===
In Virginia, US 221 runs from the North Carolina state line near Independence north to its northern terminus at US 29 Business, US 460 Business, and US 501 Business in Lynchburg. US 221 connects Independence, Galax, and Hillsville in Southwest Virginia while running concurrently with US 58. The U.S. Highway connects those communities with Roanoke via Floyd County, within which US 221 is the main west–east highway. The U.S. Highway also runs concurrently with US 460 from Roanoke to Bedford and parallels that U.S. Highway from Bedford to Lynchburg.

<text>King Street is a major road in Alexandria, Virginia, United States and historic Old Town Alexandria. It extends westward from the Potomac River waterfront near the Torpedo Factory Art Center and nearby bustling tourist gift shops and restaurants, passing City Hall and the Alexandria General District Court.

== History ==
In 1964 Richard Muzzrole begins nine years of excavations along King Street. In 1965 artifacts from King Street homes, shops, and taverns are excavated by Malcolm Watkins of the Smithsonian Institution. During the 1960s urban renewal prompted the demolition of a six block area along King Street. In 1965 Bulldozers revealed creamware, glasswork, porcelain, and pottery. Bulldozers preparing for parking garage construction revealed brick lined wells. In 1977 Pamela Cressey begins excavations at the King Street courthouse. Deep wear marks on wine bottles found within King Street privies reveal the practice of refilling bottles at taverns.

In 2007 the American Planning Association listed King Street as a &quot;2011 Great Place in America&quot; within the &quot;Great Streets&quot; category.

King Street is currently seen as an active strip of commerce and tourism that successfully accommodates both Alexandria&#x27;s local residents as well as its visitors. Historically the street was used as access to the seaport and later as a main center of trade. The balance between past and present is noticeable with the vitality of the street&#x27;s noteworthy character. Architectural and demolition regulations have been employed to allow for the continued visual appeal of 18th and 19th century buildings. Zoning laws, particularly those established in 2005 and 2007, are responsible for ensuring mixed use on this street. Various businesses, outdoor dining and other activities can be found all along King Street. One amenity to this street is the Market Square found at Alexandria City Hall as it is one of the oldest U.S. farmers markets and is often used to provide venue space for concerts, festivals, and community events. Other features found on King Street include Alexandria City Hall, which is in the style of the period during the Second Empire, and clock tower that was designed by Benjamin Henry Latrobe. The Torpedo Factory Art Center is another hotspot for tourism and is currently used as studio housing for artists.

205 King Street, a spite house, dates to the late 18th century or early 19th. It is the oldest of Old Town&#x27;s spite houses.

== Route ==

On reaching the Washington Metro and Amtrak stations and the George Washington National Masonic Memorial, King Street bends. Between Russell Road and Janney&#x27;s Lane, green bike lanes exist. Wealthier residents fought against these. King Street passes Chinquapin Recreation Center, Alexandria City High School and several historic churches, becoming Leesburg Pike as it leaves Alexandria at Bailey&#x27;s Crossroads. King Street becomes State Route 7 west of Washington Street (State Route 400). In Old Town, King Street is designated as the dividing line between north and south in the addressing system, while Duke Street (State Route 236) is designated as the dividing line in the West End area of Alexandria. King Street follows the original southwest border for the District of Columbia, becoming Leesburg Pike then Route 7 as it extends westward into Fairfax County.

== Transportation==
The Washington Metro has a station at King Street, just west of Old Town, on the Blue and Yellow Lines. Also, the King Street Trolley takes passengers on a ride along King Street every 15 minutes.

<text>Vinland is an unincorporated community in Douglas County, Kansas, United States. It is located south of Lawrence and north of Baldwin City.

==History==
The first settlement was made at Vinland in 1854. In the earliest days of the community, some called it &quot;Coal Creek&quot;, due to deposits of the sedimentary rock in a nearby waterway. The settlement eventually earned the name &quot;Vineland&quot; (after the orchard of one of the first settlers, William Barnes), which later evolved into &quot;Vinland&quot; after a clerical error. Most of the settlers of the early community were abolitionists or Free-Staters from New England, and consequently, they opposed the extension of slavery into Kansas Territory.

In 1859, Annie Soule and Martha Cutter helped found a library (and an associated book club), in the hopes that it &quot;would contribute to the &#x27;moral, social, and intellectual improvement of [the settlement&#x27;s] members&quot;; specifically, they hoped &quot;to prevent dancing from becoming the only amusement in the community.&quot; The library initially boasted a collection 10 books (which eventually grew to over 2,000), and residents of the small town were allowed to check them out if they contributed an annual fee of 50 cents. The building that currently holds the collection was constructed in 1900 when the community&#x27;s book supply grew too large. Today, Coal Creek Library is considered the oldest subscription library in the state.

Vinland was not legally platted until the 1860s. A post office was opened in Vinland in 1868, and remained in operation until 1954. In 1912, the population of the settlement was 75, and it housed &quot;a fine agricultural district ... [and] express and telegraph facilities&quot;. Today, the Vinland Grange Hall is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Education==
The community is served by Baldwin City USD 348 public school district.

On December 13, 2010, the Board of Education voted to close Vinland Elementary in Vinland and Marion Springs Elementary in Worden by a 5-2 vote.

<doc id="902635" wikidata="Q7086334" url="?curid=902635" title="Olelbis">
<text>Olelbis (meaning &quot;he who is above&quot;) is the creator deity in Wintun mythology. The antagonist of Olelbis is Sedit.

==Account==
According to the mythology of the Wintum tribe, Olelbis desired that the members of the human race should live together as brothers and sisters; that there should be no birth and no death, that life should be agreeable and easy, and the purpose of life should be to rejoining Olelbis in heaven and live with him for all eternity. To satisfy the hunger of the human body, Olelbis created a species of nut which has no shell and falls off the tree when it is ripe (this species of nut or fruit is still a staple item of the Wintum&#x27;s diet). Olelbis ordered two brothers to build a paved road from earth to heaven to facilitate the tribe&#x27;s reunion with their Creator. But Sedit appeared on the scene and persuaded one of the brothers that it would be better to engage in sexual intercourse and procreate the human species. The one persuaded by Sedit argued the other into agreement, so both defected from Olelbis and joined together to destroy the road they were building to heaven. Sedit, horrified when he finds he has brought death to the human race and must die himself, tries to escape his fate. He makes himself a mechanism of boughs and leaves (a plane), by means of which he hopes to fly to heaven. But he crashes and is killed. Olelbis looks down from the heights of heaven and says, &quot;See. The first death! From henceforth (all) men shall die.&quot;

<doc id="902637" wikidata="Q5628383" url="?curid=902637" title="H. Louis Dousman">
<text>Hercules Louis Dousman II (April 3, 1848 – January 13, 1886), better known as Louis Dousman, was notable as a wealthy Midwestern socialite and art collector. He was the heir to the estate of Wisconsin millionaire Hercules Louis Dousman, who had made a career in Prairie du Chien. Dousman had a new mansion built on the site of his family&#x27;s house, and then soon moved away, living for years in St. Paul, Minnesota, and St. Louis, Missouri. In both cities he moved in upper social circles.

After his mother&#x27;s death in 1882, Dousman began to develop the family property to establish a stock farm and racing for Standardbred horses. He built a racetrack and started an annual race in July 1883. He returned to the city in 1885, establishing the Artesian Stock Farm, but died unexpectedly the next year before getting it well underway. His widow closed the farm and named the mansion as Villa Louis after Louis Dousman. It has been designated as a National Historic Landmark.

==Early life and education==
Louis Dousman was born in 1848 in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, the son of Hercules and Jane (Fisher) Rolette Dousman. His father had been a fur trader and developed great wealth as an investor and entrepreneur on the frontier, influential in expanding railroad construction across the state, exploiting the lumber industry, and investing in real estate. He was a millionaire before he died, when the United States held few figures of such wealth.

As a child, Louis was privately tutored; he later attended a preparatory school in Madison, Wisconsin. His higher education was cut short by the death of his father in 1868. The son returned to Prairie du Chien to take care of his father&#x27;s estate and help his widowed mother Jane. 

==Life as heir==
In 1870, at the age of 22, Dousman began using his inheritance. He demolished the brick house built by his father, where he had grown up, and replaced it with a modern mansion of the era. It was designed in the Italianate style by E. Townsend Mix. Dousman did not stay long in Prairie du Chien. 

In 1872, he moved to the larger city of Saint Paul, Minnesota, leaving his mother to occupy the Prairie du Chien estate. Owing to his wealth and his father&#x27;s onetime partnership with Henry Hastings Sibley, who had earlier served as Governor of Minnesota, Dousman rose quickly in St. Paul society. In 1873 he married Nina Sturgis, and the couple moved to St. Louis, Missouri. They had five children: Violet, Virginia, Nina, Louis, and Judith Dousman. 

Dousman&#x27;s father had also had prominent connections in St. Louis. Dousman readily entered its uppermost social circles. He began a career as an art collector, amassing a collection of nearly a hundred paintings, mostly Academic art from France. In 1879, he constructed a gallery adjoining his St. Louis home to showcase his collection and began opening the gallery to the public. His art collection was eventually published in 1881. Dousman received much attention in both St. Louis and other major cities across the nation for his collection. He served as art director for three years for the St. Louis Fair. 

In the 1880s his interest began to shift. Following the death of his mother in 1882, Dousman sold most of his art collection at auction in New York City. He made plans to return to Prairie du Chien. He wanted to develop the larger part of his property into a stock farm for the breeding of Standardbred horses, specifically, a line descended from Hambletonian 10. Dousman had stables and a racetrack built in Prairie du Chien, and began hosting an annual race in July 1883. He named his estate as the Artesian Stock Farm, because of the artesian wells on the property. Dousman moved all of his family from St. Louis to Prairie du Chien in 1885.

Dousman&#x27;s plans for the Artesian Stock Farm were never fully realized. On January 13, 1886, he died unexpectedly of appendicitis in Prairie du Chien. After Dousman&#x27;s death, his wife Nina sold the horses and closed the stock farm. She renamed the mansion and its associated property as Villa Louis in honor of her late husband. 

Today Villa Louis is preserved and operated as a museum by the Wisconsin Historical Society. It is designated as a National Historic Landmark.

<text>U.S. Route 321 (US 321) is a spur of U.S. Route 21. It runs for from Hardeeville, South Carolina to Lenoir City, Tennessee; with both serving as southern termini. It reaches its northernmost point at Elizabethton, Tennessee, just northeast of Johnson City. Because of its unusual &quot;north–south–north&quot; routing, U.S. Route 321 intersects both Interstate 40 and U.S. Route 70 three separate times. The highway serves different roles in each state: An alternate route to interstates in South Carolina, a major highway in North Carolina, and a scenic route in Tennessee.

===South Carolina===
US 321 provides direct access between Savannah and Columbia, serving as an alternate to Interstate 95 and Interstate 26. Starting in Hardeeville, US 321 as a mostly 2 lane highway goes through sparsely populated areas and small towns including Estill, Fairfax, and Denmark, heading in a rather straight and northward direction into the Columbia area, widening to a 5 lane highway right after Neeses, then narrowing down to a 2 lane highway right after the town of North and widening to a 5 lane highway again after Swansea and staying that way until it merges with its parent route US 21 in Dixiana. In Columbia, the route stays concurrent with US 21 through Cayce, over the Congaree River on the Blossom Street Bridge, turning left onto Huger Street, right onto Elmwood Avenue, and left onto North Main Street. The roads separate at Hyatt Park, with US 321 staying west of I-77 and US 21 north of Columbia. The route goes through to communities of Winnsboro, Chester, York, and Clover before entering North Carolina at Bowling Green.

===North Carolina===
US 321 is an important route in Western North Carolina. It provides an alternative north–south route to I-77, which passes through a busy metropolitan area, and US 221, which is more twisty drive up the Appalachians. Travelers from South Carolina who are going to points west of Charlotte and want to avoid the traffic of I-77 may choose to enter the state on US 321.

The highway traverses through seven counties: Gaston, Lincoln, Catawba, Burke, Caldwell, Watauga, and Avery. US 321 has six control cities: Gastonia, Lincolnton, Hickory, Lenoir, Blowing Rock, and Boone.

US 321 is a multilane highway beginning at the state line. After , it enters the Gastonia area. Traffic on northbound 321 through Gastonia is generally not as heavy as traffic on southbound 321 north of I-85, where it may back up for a couple of miles as drivers wait to turn onto I-85. The state completed a new interchange with I-85 in 2021 which has southbound 321 cross over 321NB at a stoplight just north of I-85. The traffic now enters I-85 northbound with a flyunder entrance ramp over a former railroad right-of-way.
The road becomes a freeway at C. Grier Beam Boulevard in Gastonia, just south of NC 275/NC 279. It remains a freeway until just north of its junction with US 70 in Hickory. The freeway bypasses a number of cities that the old US 321 route once passed through. Today, US 321 Business follows the original route, which serves Maiden, Newton, and Conover, but the freeway is a more direct route to the mountains, and the business route is generally used by local traffic only.

Traffic is usually heavy between Hickory and Lenoir. The North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) has a long-term plan to widen the road to six lanes, which is expected to begin after 2020.

North of Lenoir, US 321 is a four-lane divided highway, continuing up the steep escarpment of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Until early 2018, the road was a narrow two-lane highway from near Patterson through Blowing Rock. Work on this area continued for much of the first two decades of the 21st century. The widening of US 321 through Blowing Rock was and continues to be seen as a controversial project. Many residents of the town felt that a four-lane highway would destroy the character of the small town, and they proposed several bypass alternatives. NCDOT selected the widening as its preferred alternative, but added several features such as underground utilities, sidewalks, landscaping, and rock walls to make the widening more palatable to the residents opposed to it. These features were not present on the two-lane highway that was replaced. The final portion of the widening project, at the steepest part of the road just south of Blowing Rock, began in 2012 and was completed in 2018. Some landscaping work remains which will commence in Fall 2018 as its own project, constructed separately for beautification of the route through town.

North of Blowing Rock, US 321 is already a highway of four lanes up to King Street in Boone; thus, US 321 is a four-lane highway from the South Carolina state line to downtown Boone. Currently, US 321 meets US 421 at King Street and overlaps it over King Street to leave town to the west. NCDOT project R-2615 is proposed to widen the US 321/421 concurrency from this junction to their junction near Vilas, although this project is currently unfunded. There is a feasibility study (FS-0511A) in progress to examine the possibility of widening US 321 from the junction near Vilas to the Tennessee state line. If both of these projects were completed, then US 321 would be a four-lane highway through the entire state.

===Tennessee===

As it crosses into Tennessee, US 321 enters the Cherokee National Forest, and continues westward through the rugged valley between Pond Mountain on the south and Watauga Lake on the north. The highway passes numerous campgrounds, boat launches, and other lake-related recreational areas as it winds its way along the shores of the lake. South of Butler, the highway joins SR 67, which enters from the Mountain City area to the northeast. The Appalachian Trail crosses US 321 at its intersection with Shook Gap Road, just before the highway exits the national forest. At Hampton, US 321 intersects US 19E, and the two highways run concurrently northward into Elizabethton.

US 321 inverts directions in Elizabethton: the road is designated as southbound in both directions driving away from its intersection with US 19E. It is conterminous with US 11E through portions of Washington and Greene counties. In Greeneville, the highway continues south into Cocke County. At the Cocke-Greene County line US 321 becomes a four-laned divided highway and bypasses Parrottsville. The four-lane section ends just before US 321&#x27;s junction with SR 160 and crossing I-40 at Newport.

The stretch of US 321 from Newport south to Cosby and southwest through Pittman Center to Gatlinburg parallels the northern boundary of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and is quite scenic. From a point between Newport and Cosby to the intersection with the Little River Road, it is concurrent with SR 73. In Pigeon Forge, concurrent with US 441/Great Smoky Mountains Parkway, US 321 is a divided, multi-lane traffic-laden thoroughfare where it serves as the city&#x27;s main route, lined with hotels, outlet malls and amusement facilities. Veering southwest of Pigeon Forge, the highway takes on a more rural character as it traverses Wears Valley, and narrows down to two lanes until its junction with SR 73 Scenic (the Little River Road) at the Townsend entrance to the park. It is concurrent with SR 73 from this junction to its terminus. With the exception of a section between Townsend and Maryville, the remaining portions of the highway through Blount County are a minimum of four lanes and usually a divided highway. Once the highway reaches Fort Loudon Dam in Loudon County, it crosses the Tennessee River via a bridge, completed in 2017, southeast of the dam then intersects with US 11 in Lenoir City. US 321 has a wrong-way concurrency with SR 95 from a point several miles south of Lenoir City (near Greenback) to its terminus at I-40. In the northern part of Lenoir City, US 321 intersects I-75 and US 70 before reaching I-40. Beyond I-40, the road continues northward to Oak Ridge as the two-lane SR 95.

US 321 is a four-lane semi-divided thoroughfare from I-40 and I-75 to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, except for the stretch near Walland.

==History==

===North Carolina Highway 17===

North Carolina Highway 17 (NC 17) was an original state highway that traversed from Hickory to Boone, through Granite Falls, Hudson, Lenoir and Blowing Rock. In 1930, it was extended south on new primary routing to NC 113, in Propst Crossroads; also same year, US 321 was established in the state and overlapped NC 17 between Hickory and Boone. In 1934, NC 17 was decommissioned, with US 321 taking all north of Hickory and NC 96 taking all south.
===North Carolina Highway 155===

North Carolina Highway 155 (NC 155) was established in 1994 following the old alignment of US 321 as it was moved onto new four-lane controlled-access highway. From NC 275/NC 279, in Dallas, it traversed north through High Shoals to Lincolnton. Sharing a short concurrency with NC 150 as it bypass the downtown area of Lincolnton, it continues north meeting with main US 321, south of Maiden, continuing in concurrency through Newton and finally Conover, where it ended at US 70. In 1999, the remainder of US 321 was moved onto new freeway bypass west of Newton and Conover; at same time, NC 155 was decommissioned and absorbed into US 321 Business.
===North Carolina Highway 603===


==Future==
In addition to the widening project, . Currently, US 321 is a surface road at the I-85 interchange, and is a limited access freeway a few hundred yards north. To extend the freeway to I-85, the remaining at-grade intersections and traffic lights would have to be eliminated.

==Major intersections==





















































==Special routes==
===Winnsboro business loop===

U.S. Route 321 Business (US 321 Bus.) is a business route of US 321 that exists in Winnsboro Mills and Winnsboro, via Columbia Road and Congress Street. It was established around 1951 or 1952, when mainline US 321 was rerouted west, bypassing Winnsboro.
===Chester business loop===

U.S. Route 321 Business (US 321 Bus.) is a business route of US 321 in the city of Chester. It traverses downtown Chester, via Columbia Street and Center Road. It was established between 1962 and 1964, when mainline US 321 was rerouted west, bypassing Chester.
===York business loop===

U.S. Route 321 Business (US 321 Bus.) is a business route of US 321 in the city of York, utilizing Congress Street and Kings Mountain Street. It was established around 1957–1958, when mainline US 321 was rerouted west, bypassing York.
===Dallas–Hickory business loop===

U.S. Route 321 Business (US 321 Bus) was established in June 1999, as a renumbering all of NC 155 and part of mainline US 321 in Catawba County. Traversing through Gaston, Lincoln and Catawba counties, it connects the cities and towns of Dallas, High Shoals, Lincolnton, Maiden, Newton, Conover and Hickory. The highway follows the original US 321 routing through that existed prior to 1994.
===Lincolnton alternate route===

U.S. Route 321 Alternate (US 321A) was established 1956 when mainline US 321 was placed on new bypass east of downtown Lincolnton. It traversed along Aspen Street and around the Lincoln County Civil Court on Court Square Drive. In 1960 it was decommissioned, with Aspen Street becoming secondary roads.
===Granite Falls–Lenoir alternate route===

U.S. Route 321 Alternate (US 321A) was established 1948 as a number swap with US 321 through downtown Lenoir. In 1957, US 321A was extended south, replacing mainline US 321 through Granite Falls and Hudson, ending at its current southern terminus north of the Catawba River. In June 1964, US 321A was placed on one-way splits through downtown Lenoir; northbound continued along Mulberry Street and West Avenue, southbound rerouted along Main Street and College Avenue. In September 2006, US 321A was rerouted to its current northern terminus, just south of downtown Lenoir, via McLean Drive. Its old alignment through downtown Lenoir was carried on by NC 90 until 2012, when it too was rerouted; the old alignment is now under city control.

Traversing through Granite Falls, Sawmills, Hudson and Lenoir US 321A has not changed much over the years. Predominantly a two-lane highway, it parallels a short line railroad and connects to several factories and downtowns.
===Lenoir alternate route===

U.S. Route 321 Alternate (US 321A) was established 1941 as a new alternate route bypassing Lenoir. In 1948, it was replaced by mainline US 321.

===Blowing Rock business loop===

U.S. Route 321 Business (US 321 Bus) was established 1960 as an upgrade to secondary roads through downtown Blowing Rock; which were originally part of mainline US 321 until about 1954, when it was moved onto a new bypass east. The highway traverses along Main Street and shares a concurrency with US 221 for on its northern section.

===Boone truck route===
U.S. Route 321 Truck (US 321 Truck) redirects truckers traveling through the area to go south and around downtown Boone, via NC 105 and NC Highway 105 Bypass (SR-1107). The shares some overlap with US 221 Truck and complete overlap with US 421 Truck.
===Greeneville truck route===
U.S. Route 321 Truck (US 321 Truck) redirects truckers traveling south on US 321 around downtown. It shares a concurrency with US 11E and SR 70. The route begins at US 11E/US 321 and ends later at US 321/SR 70.

<text>U.S. Route 421 (also U.S. Highway 421, US 421) is a diagonal northwest–southeast United States Numbered Highway in the states of North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Kentucky, and Indiana. The highway runs for from Fort Fisher, North Carolina, to US 20 in Michigan City, Indiana. Along its routing, US 421 serves several cities including Wilmington, North Carolina; Greensboro, North Carolina; Bristol, Tennessee and Virginia; Lexington, Kentucky; and Indianapolis, Indiana. US 421 is a spur route of US 21, which it meets west of Yadkinville, North Carolina.

US 421 begins at Fort Fisher, North Carolina, and heads generally to the northwest to Michigan City, Indiana. Along the way, it passes through Bristol, Tennessee and Virginia; Lexington, Kentucky; and Indianapolis, Indiana.

===North Carolina===
US 421 begins near Fort Fisher State Recreation Area and heads through North Carolina&#x27;s southeastern beaches to Wilmington. It then heads in a northwesterly direction through Clinton, Dunn, Lillington, Sanford and Siler City to the Piedmont Triad region. Major highway junctions between north of Wilmington and Greensboro are North Carolina Highway 11 (NC 11), Interstate 95 (I-95), US 401, US 1, US 64 and I-85. In Greensboro, it follows the Greensboro Urban Loop paired with I-85 south of Greensboro, close to Pleasant Garden, and I-73 northwest of Greensboro, close to Colfax. It then departs the urban loop and connects to I-40 towards Forsyth County as it becomes its own freeway along the former Business Loop 40 alignment. Major intersections are NC 150, NC 66, NC 67, US 158 and US 52 between Greensboro and Winston-Salem. After Winston-Salem, it intersects I-40 once again but continues westerly passing through Lewisville, Yadkinville, Wilkesboro and Boone. Major highway junctions between Winston-Salem and Boone are US 601, I-77, NC 16, Blue Ridge Parkway, US 221 and US 321. US 421 continues westerly into Tennessee towards Mountain City, Tennessee. US 421 is a limited-access freeway through Siler City northward. US 421 is a divided highway from north of NC 49 all of the way to Wilkesboro.

===Tennessee===
US 421 enters Tennessee from North Carolina at Trade. It is the oldest crossroads community in Tennessee and is the easternmost part of the state. The road &quot;as the crow would fly&quot; is a short distance in Volunteer State but traverses through two mountain ranges. After Trade, it ventures into Mountain City through a zone while bypassing the downtown area. After Mountain City, begins the two mountain ranges and in between them is the area of Shady Valley. The two ranges are a popular motorcycle route known as &quot;The Snake&quot;. More than 400 curves over an approximately ride. After the second mountain range, it flattens out after the South Fork Holston River heading towards Bristol. US 421 enters Virginia on the Old Dominion side of Bristol. Major highway junctions between the NC and VA state lines are State Route 67 (SR 67) in Mountain City, SR 91 the new Mountain City bypass, SR-394, and US 11E.

===Virginia===

US 421 enters from Tennessee in Bristol and goes west to Weber City, Duffield, and Pennington Gap in Southwest Virginia. The route goes through the Cumberland and Powell Mountains, and goes by Natural Tunnel State Park near Duffield.

===Kentucky===

US 421 enters the Bluegrass State running from the Pennington Gap area in Virginia into Harlan County.

For the distance between the Virginia state line and closer to Hal Rogers Parkway, it is a major north–south two-lane highway. However, its passing zones are largely limited to a stretch after the Virginia line, through Harlan and along US 119. US 421 then crosses Pine Mountain and enters Leslie County, turning west at Hyden and paralleling the Hal Rogers Parkway. Between Manchester and McKee, US 421 functions as more of a local road with many curves.

The roadway improves as it descends from the Cumberland Plateau into the Bluegrass Region at Big Hill in Madison County near Berea. It joins US 25 at the Blue Grass Army Depot south of Richmond and roughly parallels I-75 towards Lexington. Through Lexington, it is Richmond Road, Main Street and Leestown Road. The segment between Lexington and Frankfort was once designated Kentucky Route 50 (KY 50). US 62 runs briefly with US 421 in this section.

In Frankfort, US 421 runs with US 60 on the west side of town, then runs within the city&#x27;s northern bypass, briefly joining US 127. US 421 then traverses the very hilly area of northwest Franklin County, around the Flag Fork community. It then runs through Henry and Trimble counties, exiting the state at Milton, crossing the Ohio River into Madison, Indiana via the Milton–Madison Bridge.

===Indiana===
US 421 winds through the southern part of Indiana as it runs from Madison, in the southeastern part of the state, to Indianapolis. North of Greensburg, US 421 intersects and merges with I-74 west, through the Shelbyville area en route to Indianapolis. Originally, US 421 followed Southeastern Avenue into downtown Indianapolis, where it merged with US 40 (Washington Street) to West Street, then turned north, following West Street, Northwestern Avenue (later MLK Street), and Michigan Road up to the northwest side of the city. US 421 went past the Pyramids, an Indianapolis landmark. North of Indianapolis, US 421 continues to the north-northwest, providing a direct highway link between Indianapolis and Michigan City. US 421 ends at its junction with US 20 on the south side of Michigan City. Originally, the highway&#x27;s end was a few miles north at the junction with US 12 near the shores of Lake Michigan.

==History==
===North Carolina===
US 421 mainly followed the same route between Clinton and Wilmington. However, there are several old alignments from Clinton to the Tennessee state line.

*US 421 bypasses Clinton, old alignment uses local streets.
*Between Dunn and Sanford, uses an old alignment, fully connected.
*Between Goldston and Greensboro, uses several old alignments but not fully connected.
*Between Greensboro and Wilkesboro, uses multiple old alignments of different alignments. In *addition, they are no longer connected consistently.
*US 421 bypasses Wilkesboro, with a special US Business route.
*Between Deep Gap and Boone, uses a new alignment.
*Between Vilas and the Tennessee state line, uses an old alignment.

==Future==
US 421 is projected to be upgraded to a freeway in Indiana from Greensburg to Versailles. US 421 freeway will go near, or pass through Napoleon and Osgood.

<text>U.S. Route 521 (US 521) is a north–south United States Highway that traverses , from Georgetown, South Carolina, to Charlotte, North Carolina. Though numbered as an auxiliary route of US 21, it does not actually intersect its parent &quot;or&quot; any of its sibling routes, though it is in the same general part of the country as other routes from its family. Historically, it once connected to US 21 in Pineville, North Carolina, but various changes have left it terminating a few miles short of the current US 21.

==Route description==
===South Carolina===
Starting at the city of Georgetown, US 521 runs through the town Andrews to Greeleyville. From here to the city of Manning it is known as the Greeleyville Highway. There is a brief section right before Manning where it runs concurrent with SC 261. In Manning SC 261 branches off and US 521 merges with US 301 for a short distance. It crosses over Interstate 95 (I-95) and heads to the city of Sumter. In Sumter, it runs together with US Business 378. Leaving Sumter, US 521 is known as Camden Highway. It passes under I-20 and proceeds to Camden. It then goes on to the town of Kershaw, running concurrent with US 601. The final city it goes through before going into North Carolina is Lancaster.

===North Carolina===
US 521 traverses from the South Carolina state line to I-485. The entire route is a four- to six-lane divided highway, split in naming between Lancaster Highway and Johnston Road.

==History==
Established in 1932, it was overlapped entirely with SC 26, from Georgetown to the North Carolina state line, where it continued with NC 26 into Pineville, where it ended at U.S. Route 21/NC 261 (now NC 51). In 1933, SC 26 was decommissioned; followed in 1934 with the decommissioning of NC 26.

In 1949, US 521 was rerouted in Williamsburg County to run directly from Andrews, through Salters and Greeleyville, to Manning; which replaced SC 171 and part of SC 261, the old alignment became part of SC 377 and SC 261. Between 1962 and 1964, US 521 was rerouted at the Sumter-Kershaw county line to Camden; the old alignment became an extension of SC 261.

In 1969, US 521 was extended north, via South Boulevard, and Wilkinson Blvd, then in 1981, by way of Woodlawn Road, and Billy Graham Parkway, to I-85 in Charlotte.

Between 1986 and 1988, US 521 was moved west onto new highway west of Dalzell, bypassing the town; the old alignment was downgraded to secondary roads.

In 1996, US 521 was rerouted onto I-485, between exits 61 and 65; the old alignment was downgraded to secondary roads. In 2003, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) approved US 521 to be truncated at its current northern terminus at the Johnston Road/I-485 interchange; its old alignment north to I-85 was downgraded to secondary roads.

==Future==
There are plans to make US 521 a four-lane highway from Georgetown to I-95, in Manning. This would improve a route for beach goers traveling toward the Litchfield/Pawleys area.

<text>Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) is an American nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting people living with muscular dystrophy, ALS, and related neuromuscular diseases. Founded in 1950 by Paul Cohen, who lived with Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), MDA accelerates research, advances care, and works to empower families to live longer and more independent lives but is perhaps known for its working relationship with comedian, entertainer and actor Jerry Lewis, its national chairman of 55 years and host of his annual Labor Day-held telethon, aired live each year. The organization&#x27;s headquarters is in Chicago, Illinois.

== History ==
The organization was founded in 1950 by a group with personal connections to muscular dystrophy, including Paul Cohen who lived with Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). Originally known as the Muscular Dystrophy Associations of America, it was renamed to its present name in the 1970s.

In 1954, MDA began its partnership with the International Association of Fire Fighters for its annual Fill the Boot fundraising drive. In 1955, the organization held its first summer camp.

In 1980, American motorcycle manufacturer Harley Davidson became an MDA National Sponsor; in 1987 the MDA Ride For Life program began, a fundraising motorcycle ride held over Labor Day weekend. In 1986, oil and gas provider Citgo became a second national sponsor of the organization.

In 1982, the MDA Shamrocks program launched in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and became a national program one year later. In 1996, MDA and Lewis were jointly honored by the American Medical Association with a lifetime achievement awards for their contributions to the health and welfare of humanity.

Dr. Stanley Appel established Houston Methodist Hospital&#x27;s amyotrophic lateral sclerosis clinic with MDA in 1982, which has evolved into the MDA ALS Research and Clinical Center at the Houston Methodist Neurological Institute. Dr. Appel&#x27;s pioneering work includes the development of an immunotherapy treatment that may slow the progression of ALS. Dr. Appel&#x27;s efforts were recognized by the MDA when he received the MDA&#x27;s Tribute Award in 2022.

In October 2020, the MDA Telethon, which had originally run from 1966 to 2014, was reimagined as &quot;The MDA Kevin Hart Kids Telethon&quot; after a six-year hiatus. The two-hour event was held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and streamed live on the Laugh Out Loud network and its YouTube channel. Celebrity guests for the 2020 telethon included Jack Black, Josh Gad, Michael B. Jordan, and Jillian Mercado.

In November 2020, MDA launched a tool, called the neuroMuscular ObserVational Research (MOVR) Visualization and Reporting Platform (VRP), to help make clinical data more accessible and accelerate the discovery of muscular dystrophy treatments.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, MDA converted several of its traditional programs to virtual formats and introduced new virtual programming. The latter included several Facebook Live events discussing challenges that the pandemic placed on people with disabilities. It also provided COVID-19 resources and recommendations for neuromuscular patients and providers via its online resource center. Throughout stay at home orders due to the COVID-19 pandemic, MDA shared a &quot;joke of the day&quot; from National Ambassador Ethan Lybrand via their social media channels.

In January 2021, MDA announced NFL running back Nyheim Hines as its national spokesperson.

The Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) was established to lead research and support for individuals affected by muscular dystrophy and related diseases. 

In a recent [interview](https://denver-frederick.com/2024/01/12/the-muscular-dystrophy-association-reimagined-a-chat-with-mdas-dr-donald-wood/) with Denver Frederick, Dr. Donald Wood, the current CEO of MDA, discussed the organization&#x27;s founding legacy and its evolving role in reimagining support and research for the muscular dystrophy community. Dr. Wood highlighted MDA&#x27;s commitment to continuing the vision of its founders through expanded programs and initiatives.

=== National Ambassador ===
MDA has a tradition of selecting National Ambassadors who are people living with neuromuscular disease. Since the program&#x27;s inception in 1952, over 45 National Ambassadors have shared their experiences to emphasize the need for funding research and developing treatments and cures for neuromuscular diseases. These representatives engage with partners, volunteers, supporters, and notable figures, gaining exposure through social media channels and national media outlets. Former youth ambassadors have pursued diverse fields in adulthood, advocating for improvements in accessibility, early intervention treatments through newborn screening, and advancements in research and care for MDA families and individuals living with disabilities. MDA&#x27;s National Ambassadors were formerly known as &quot;National Goodwill Ambassadors&quot;, which, until the 1980s, were referred to as &quot;poster children&quot;. In 1952, the MDA inaugurated Michael Danna as its first Poster Child. 

One of the most well-known ambassadors was Mattie Stepanek, the National Goodwill Ambassador from 2002 until his death in 2004, notable for his best-selling &quot;Heartsongs&quot; series of poetry books, and his appearances on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; and &quot;Good Morning America.&quot; Another notable ambassador is Ethan LyBrand, who has Duchenne muscular dystrophy and gained national recognition for his Shorty Award-winning &quot;Joke-A-Day for MDA&quot; campaign during the COVID-19 pandemic.

=== Research ===
In 1986, MDA-funded researcher Louis M. Kunkel identified the dystrophin gene, the gene for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). MDA funded the first gene therapy trial in 1999, followed by the first vector-based gene therapy trial for DMD in 2006.

In 2007, MDA funded Adrian R. Krainer and his colleagues at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in Laurel Hollow, New York for the early-stage development of nusinersen. Nusinersen became FDA approved in 2016 as the first treatment for spinal muscular dystrophy (SMA).

As of 2018, MDA had a total funding commitment of more than $58 million distributed among 312 research grants. By 2019, MDA supported 252 research projects worldwide, totaling a funding commitment of more than $66 million.

MDA is actively involved in supporting the development of gene therapies for rare neuromuscular diseases. In 2023, the association introduced the Kickstart Program to lower the barriers to gene therapy development. The program assembles a team of experts to collaboratively assist selected projects, positioning them for follow-on grant funding. The Kickstart Program was presented at the 2023 MDA Clinical &amp; Scientific Conference, where discussions focused on opportunities to de-risk gene therapies, current barriers to development, collaborative frameworks, and data management.

MDA supported the FDA&#x27;s decision in 2023 to approve an experimental gene therapy developed by Sarepta Therapeutics that aims to slow the progression of Duchenne muscular dystrophy by facilitating the production of a protein called micro-dystrophin in patients&#x27; muscles. Advancements in Duchenne muscular dystrophy treatment have prompted MDA to lobby for newborn screening panels for early detection and treatment initiation.

== Programs and events ==
=== Fill the Boot Drive ===
During National Boot Day, the MDA partners with the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) to launch Fill the Boot fundraising events. These events help support research, care, and advocacy for families affected by muscular dystrophy, ALS, and related neuromuscular diseases in the United States. The partnership between MDA and IAFF dates back to 1954, with IAFF designating MDA as its charity of choice. Firefighters across the country have raised $690 million over nearly seven decades, leading to breakthroughs in research, FDA-approved treatments, and advocacy efforts such as access to care and newborn screening.

MDA&#x27;s annual payments to IAFF, which ranged from $980,000 to $1.4 million between 2015 and 2020 according to U.S. Department of Labor filings, received some scrutiny for their size relative to the charity&#x27;s expenditures.

=== Telethon ===

Debuting in 1966 and held annually on Labor Day weekend until 2014, the telethon was originally hosted by veteran film star, comedian and singer Jerry Lewis, who also served as the MDA&#x27;s national chairman since its inception in 1950 and hosted the show until 2010. In 2005, the MDA made the unprecedented decision to pledge $1 million of the telethon&#x27;s money raised to Hurricane Katrina disaster relief, making the donation specifically to the Salvation Army (though the telethon also urged viewers to give to the American Red Cross). In 2008, the annual televised fundraiser raised a record $65,031,393. Originally broadcast for up to 21½ hours from 1966 to 2010, the event was cut back to six hours in 2011. The 2011 edition of the telethon was originally announced to have been Lewis&#x27; last as host, with him continuing his role as national chairman; however, on August 3, 2011, the MDA announced that Lewis resigned as host and chairman, due to circumstances not revealed. However, in 2016, one year before his death, Lewis broke a five-year silence in a video endorsing MDA&#x27;s redesigned web site and brand, declaring that the work to end muscular dystrophy be continued.

Additionally, Lewis&#x27; support was so ironclad over the years that children and adults assisted by MDA are referred to as &quot;Jerry&#x27;s Kids&quot;. From 2012 to 2014, the show was known as the &quot;MDA Show of Strength&quot;. In early 2015, the organization announced it was discontinuing the show.

On September 9, 2020, MDA executives announced plans to relaunch their annual MDA telethon with a new host, comedian Kevin Hart. Entitled &quot;The MDA Kevin Hart Kids Telethon&quot;, the new two-hour telethon was seen exclusively through participating social media platforms; the event was broadcast October 24, 2020, at 8 p.m. EDT. The special was a dual-charity event, with proceeds going towards both MDA and &quot;Help From The Hart&quot;, an organization founded by the aforementioned new host of the program. Hart&#x27;s charity announced that it will use its portion of funds raised to &quot;support education, health, and social needs programs targeting underserved communities and servicing youth through education scholarships.&quot; The telethon was accompanied by a 10-hour Let&#x27;s Play livestream, called Let&#x27;s Play For A Cure, which featured DJ and producer Zedd, gaming personality missharvey and esports athletes. The live stream was part of a week-long &quot;streamathon&quot;, which featured esports stars playing games including &quot;League of Legends&quot;, Ro&quot;cket Lea&quot;gue, &quot;Fortnite&quot;, &quot;Call of Duty&quot; and &quot;Fall Guys&quot;.

Following the Kevin Hart Kids Telethon was MDA&#x27;s 70th Anniversary Show, hosted by entertainment TV journalists Nancy O&#x27;Dell and Jann Carl.

=== MDA Clinical &amp; Scientific Conference ===
The MDA Clinical &amp; Scientific Conference is a prominent event that gathers over 2,000 professionals, including scientists and clinicians, specializing in neuromuscular diseases. The conference showcases research, fosters collaborations, and promotes the latest advancements in the field. It covers various aspects of research, from pre-clinical to clinical, and supports the development of improved care and treatment for the neuromuscular community. The conference also hosts the Annual Insights in Research Investment Summit, which focuses on research and investment stakeholders in neuromuscular diseases. The 2023 conference featured a keynote address by Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA&#x27;s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, on the growing impact of gene therapies in treating rare disorders.

=== Quest Media ===
MDA publishes a quarterly magazine, Quest, catering to people with neuromuscular diseases and their caretakers. Mindy Henderson, diagnosed with type 2 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and a patient advocate, is the editor-in-chief as of 2023. The magazine, with a circulation of around 100,000, extends its reach through distribution at neurologists&#x27; offices and the MDA&#x27;s network of 150 care centers across the country. Besides focusing on science and research, Quest&#x27;s coverage includes adaptive lifestyles, travel, medical equipment, accessible fashion, employment, and media representation.

=== MDA Summer Camp ===
Every summer, for one week, thousands of children from across the country who have been diagnosed with neuromuscular diseases are able to attend a camp designated for only them. MDA Summer Camp offers children and young adults the opportunity to participate in recreational activities that foster independence, self-confidence, skill development, and friendships. There is a one counselor to one camper ratio and the entire week the children, ages 8–17, are paired with an adult volunteer. They participate in activities and games and stay overnight. The camps are set up locally and are different weeks throughout May through August. The entire camp staff are volunteer members and are required to interview and apply with good recommendations. The camp is offered at no cost to campers and their families; the cost of the camp for the campers and volunteers is covered by the many fundraisers the MDA does each year.
=== Muscle Walk ===
Started in 2010, the MDA Muscle Walk is an annual 1 to 3.1-mile lap event held in over 150 communities across the United States to raise money for research and patient services. In 2022, MDA resumed in-person Muscle Walks in numerous locations, including Phoenix, Chicago, St. Louis, Detroit, Boston, Twin Cities, Houston, and Dallas, while continuing to offer a virtual Muscle Walk option to enhance participation flexibility.

=== Shamrocks retail fundraising campaign ===
Throughout February and March, retailers across the US contributed to the MDA Shamrocks campaign, the largest St. Patrick&#x27;s Day fundraising initiative in the country. They provide customers with the opportunity to either round up their purchases or donate a specific amount, such as $1, $3, or $5. Customers can write their names on paper shamrocks, which are then displayed in stores to show support for MDA&#x27;s mission to empower people with neuromuscular diseases to lead longer, more independent lives.

=== Care Center Network ===
MDA&#x27;s Care Center Network is recognized as the largest network of multidisciplinary clinics specializing in neuromuscular diseases in the United States, with over 150 clinics distributed throughout the country. In addition to offering specialized care, these centers are also active sites of research. 

In 2023, MDA expanded its Resource Center by launching the Gene Therapy Support Network. This network provides resources and guidance about approved gene therapies for people living with neuromuscular diseases, aiming to help the community navigate the complexities of emerging gene therapies. Clinical networking through the MDA Care Center Network contributes additional support by facilitating best practice sharing between different care centers.

== Diseases targeted ==
MDA targets a wide range of neuromuscular diseases, including muscular dystrophies, motor neuron diseases, ion channel diseases, mitochondrial diseases, myopathies, neuromuscular junction diseases, and peripheral nerve diseases. Specific examples include Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a severe form of muscular dystrophy, ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), and Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT), which impacts peripheral nerves. 

MDA also addresses numerous rare disorders, such as Andersen–Tawil syndrome, Laing distal myopathy, and Walker–Warburg syndrome. Additionally, the association covers conditions like Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), congenital muscular dystrophies (CMD), myotonic dystrophy (DM), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and myasthenia gravis (MG).

== Legislation ==
MDA supported the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act of 2013 (H.R. 1281; 113th Congress), a bill that would amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize grant programs and other initiatives to promote expanded screening of newborns and children for heritable disorders. The MDA argued that &quot;many of the drug therapies currently under development for MDA&#x27;s community will be of most benefit if administered either pre-symptomatically or early in the progression of the disease. Thus, for some of the diseases in MDA&#x27;s program, the availability of a newborn screening program at the time of treatment availability presents the best opportunity for impacting optimal and potentially lifesaving treatment outcomes.&quot;

MDA supported the Paul D. Wellstone Muscular Dystrophy Community Assistance, Research and Education Amendments of 2013 (H.R. 594; 113th Congress), a bill that would amend the Public Health Service Act to revise the muscular dystrophy research program of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). MDA argued that &quot;a great deal of work still needs to be done, and increased federal support is needed to ensure that researchers can continue making progress toward finding a cure.&quot;

In December 2021, President Joe Biden signed the Accelerating Access to Critical Therapies for ALS Act into law. The act aimed to speed up the development and approval of therapies for ALS and other neuromuscular diseases. During the signing ceremony, President Biden acknowledged the Muscular Dystrophy Association for playing a crucial role in advocating for the legislation.

In May 2024, MDA supported the reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) through a $105 billion bill passed by Congress. The legislation includes improvements in air travel accessibility for people with disabilities, representing significant progress in this area.

== Independent charity assessments ==
MDA is recognized by the Better Business Bureau&#x27;s Wise Giving Alliance as an accredited charity that meets all 20 Standards for Charity Accountability. As of the year ending December 31, 2022, MDA reported significant funding directed towards patient and community services, professional public health education, and research. The organization&#x27;s financial activities, leadership compensation, and fundraising methods are transparently disclosed, emphasizing their commitment to accountability and ethical practices.

Charity Navigator, which is the largest independent evaluator of charities, gives MDA two out of four stars based on Financial, Accountability, and Transparency Performance Metrics. In 2019, CharityWatch gave MDA a grade of D, citing many financial issues in the organization.

MDA has received the Candid Platinum Seal of Transparency from GuideStar, recognizing its commitment to transparency and accountability.

== Criticism ==

MDA and Lewis have been criticized by disability rights activists for their tendency to paint disabled people as, these advocates say, &quot;pitiable victims who want and need nothing more than a big charity to take care of or cure them.&quot;

<doc id="902661" wikidata="Q1463528" url="?curid=902661" title="Sporran">
<text>The sporran (; Scottish Gaelic for &#x27;purse&#x27;), a traditional part of male Scottish Highland dress, is a pouch that functions as a pocket for the kilt. Made of leather or fur, the ornamentation of the sporran is chosen to complement the formality of dress worn with it. The sporran is worn on a leather strap or chain, conventionally positioned in front of the groin of the wearer.

Since the traditional kilt does not have pockets, the sporran serves as a wallet and container for any other necessary personal items. It is essentially a remnant of the common European medieval belt-pouch, superseded elsewhere as clothing came to have pockets, but continuing in the Scottish Highlands because of the lack of these accessories in traditional dress. The sporran hangs below the belt buckle; and much effort is made to match their style and design. The kilt belt buckle may be very ornate, and contain similar motifs to the sporran cantle and the sgian dubh. Early sporrans would have been worn suspended from the belt or on either of the hips, rather than hung from a separate strap in front of the wearer.
When driving a car, dancing, playing drums, or engaging in any activity where a heavy pouch might encumber the wearer, the sporran may be turned around the waist to let it hang on the hip in a more casual position.

==Types==
=== Day sporrans ===

Day sporrans are usually brown leather shovel pouches with simple adornment. These &quot;day&quot; sporrans often have three or more leather tassels and frequently Celtic knot designs carved or embossed into the leather. This style of traditional purse is convenient to use on a daily basis. This style is often made entirely of leather, with a leather flap, front, and three tassels or more. They are often embossed or hand-tooled with Celtic, thistle, or other designs on the flap and body, and fasten with a stud or hook closure.
=== Dress sporrans ===

Dress sporrans can be larger than the day variety, and are often highly ornate. Victorian examples were usually quite ostentatious, and much more elaborate than the simple leather pouch of the 17th or 18th century. They may have sterling or silver-plated cantles trimming the top of the pouch and a fur-covered face with fur or hair tassels. The cantle may contain intricate filigree or etchings of Celtic knots. The top of the cantle may have a set stone, jewel, or emblems such as Saint Andrew, a thistle, Clan, or Masonic symbols.

====Full-dress sporrans====
This style is regarded as the most formal type of sporran. It is an essential attachment for those who wear kilts in special ceremonies and formal events. It normally contains fur fronts, a fur gusset, 3–6 decorative fur tassels with regular or cross chains, and a metal cantle at the top. The cantle arcs along the top of the pouch and conceals a clasp, ordinarily made from pewter or silver. It might be decorated with Celtic symbols such as the lion rampant, thistle, stag, or Saltire. Some elaborate cantles may include gemstones, such as garnets. This style commonly fastens at the rear with a stud on a small flap that connects the front and rear of the sporran. It allows the wearer to carry a range of items due to the larger size of this sporran.
==== Semi-dress sporrans ====
Semi-dress sporrans combine the same shape and design as the day-wear sporran and a less formal version of the full dress sporran. They are often worn for semi-formal occasions with Argyll outfits. Designs may decorate the leather flap of this style, or a silver clan symbol or other insignia may adorn on the flap. The body fur of this style is normally a hair hide rather than a loftier material reserved for full dress sporrans. The basic figure is commonly included with a fur front, leather gusset, three decorated fur tassels with regular or cross-chains, and a leather flap at the top. Celtic or Scottish designs often are featured on the flap, and may have pewter badges&#x27; decoration to raise the design.

==== Full mask sporrans ====
This style is commonly made from the head of an animal such as the badger, otter, fox, Scottish wildcat, pine marten, or other small animals. The animal&#x27;s head typically forms the front flap of the pouch, and the body of the pouch is made from the same pelt. This style displays the Scottish tradition, since the earliest pouches probably included the head with the pelt. Today, people do not wear this style very often for standard formal occasions, though it may be worn in historic re-enactments and festivals as a costume accessory.
==== Horsehair sporrans ====
This style is most commonly worn as part of regimental attire for the pipers or the drummers. In general, it is one of the most dramatic and biggest of dress-sporrans with a very formal style. A traditional horsehair pouch extends just below the belt to just below the hem of the kilt. The most ordinary pattern contains black horsehair tassels on a white horsehair background. Pewter or silver cantle is also carved on the sporran. This style made from horsehide rather than tail hair, are more able to keep with the compact shape and decor of less showy, semi-dress versions.
== Materials and law ==

As sporrans are typically made of animal skin, their production, ownership, and transportation across borders may be regulated by legislation set to control the trade of protected and endangered species. A 2007 BBC report on legislation introduced by the Scottish Executive stated that sporran owners may need licences to prove that the animals used in construction of their pouch conformed to these regulations.

In 2009, European politicians voted to ban the sale of seal products putting an end to the use of seal in sporran production.

==Tradition in Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Regiment==
===Tradition===
Soldiers did not wear sporrans very often in daily life. The main function of sporrans were used as haversack, for each Highlander carried his own provision of oatmeal—eating it if necessary, raw, or mixed with a little cold water—as did Montrose in the dawn before the Battle of Inverlochy. To have enough comfort for a soldier to be able to walk, the sporran usually would be worn as high as possible. Soldiers normally could get a sporran from the regimental office free of charge, as long as they gave it back when they left the Regiment. However, some officers and sergeants had to pay and book their own unique styles of sporrans. That sporran was their private property, no matter if they still stayed and served in the Regiments.

For most highlander regiments, they used different number of tassels to distinguish their own unique symbol. For example, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders regiment used six tassels on sporrans to differ with other highlanders&#x27; regiments. The general rules for six tassels are: two at the top in a line, two under them in a line, and two in the centre to hang below these, so that a line drawn across the bottom of the side tassels would pass through the centre of the centre tassels. The sporran-belt when on the man is to be cut to three inches from the buckle, and to be cut to a point in the shoemaker&#x27;s shop—it is not to be doubled into the keeper; one keeper will be sufficient—and the point of strap will be in the direction of the right hip, and the buckle will be worn exactly over the spine and not to one side.

The tradition of wearing sporran in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Regiment is a bit different from the daily wearing of other highlanders. The official description of the dress sporran is &quot;engraved gilt top, five sided, square edges, with centre in black enamel. On the centre, Boar&#x27;s head and scroll. Princess&#x27; Coronet on top with her Cypher, the cat and scroll similar to full dress headdress. Six small gold bullion tassels.&quot;

Here are the dress regulations to indicate; the dress sporran was not to exceed eleven inches in length, and the badger-skin sporran no more than thirteen inches. The dress sporran was not to have more than six tassels. Officers were permitted to wear undress sporran resembling the men&#x27;s. Goatskins with silver tassels were differed as the style of the officers&#x27; sporran with other ranks. The knobs (i.e. the bells) on the tassels of the officer&#x27;s purse were ordered to the gilt. The rank-and-file purse was of black hair with white tassels, and was still larger and broader than formerly.

===Typical types===
In terms of historic records, there are six different types of sporran which were used in the regimental events. The Badger-head sporrans were typically used by the officers and sergeants. The horsehair sporrans were widely used in different ranks. The swinging six sporrans were extremely popular for the soldiers.

Badger-head sporran typically forms as the front flap of the pouch, and the body of the pouch is made from the same pelt. From the year 1800, the badger skin probably was a widely used material for sporrans and became a new fashion trend for the officers and sergeants as in most Highland corps, opening in front, with a straight narrow silver or brass top, edged with crimson leather, two rows of small white tassels and silver bells, mounted on red leather and suspended by twisted white leather thongs or cords. In ordinary occasions, officers and sergeants started to wear a sporran of badger skin with the head and narrow brass curved top, edged with black leather, and six white tassels in brass cups.

The rank and file wore similar ones of black or grey goatskin, but the white tassels had red cords. The sporran had a white buff leather strap and was somewhat smaller and squarer than the modern pattern. It was worn in the old fashion, well braced up, close to the jacket. These sporrans, unlike the present day ones, had a large roomy pouch, the opening being concealed by the flat top.

Horsehair sporran was normally worn by pipers and drummers of the Regimental music band. The most ordinary pattern contains black horsehair tassels on a white horsehair background. Pewter or silver cantle is also carved on the sporran. Sometimes, the pattern thistle decorated cantle and tassel tops. It&#x27;s widely distinguished as the most popular pattern of an officer&#x27;s sporran with white horsehair background, and normal soldier&#x27;s with black horsehair background.

Swinging six sporran is generally known as a &quot;swinging six&quot; due to the six white horse hair tassels which hang from the front of the sporran, made of black goatskin. Behind the brass cantle is a leather purse to keep money or personal items in. The style of sporran was adopted as part of the Sutherland Highlanders&#x27; uniform between 1823 and 1826 and was later worn as part of the uniform of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Regiment after the 93rd and 91st amalgamated in 1881. This type of sporran was commonly worn by the sergeants and soldiers.

White sporran was issued as a buff coloured leather sporran that had to be coated in a white liquid which dried to form a white surface (This often rubbed off onto the front of the kilt). A regimental sporran badge was then attached to the front. This style was only worn on limited occasions and did not replace the swinging six sporrans or the other plain leather one, both of which continued to be worn throughout this period. Most soldiers were happy when the white sporran was no longer issued as part of the uniform of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders.

Civilian sporran worn by General Duncan Campbell of Lochnell. The sporran has a silver cantle, a border decorated with thistle foliage, and a central coat of arms of the Campbell of Lochnell family; six silver thread tassels; and, a white goat hair covering on a white/light tan leather sporran edged in black leather.

Plain leather sporran has become very popular today, as it is convenient to wear daily. This style concentrates on practical function more than aesthetic value, it only keeps the Regimental badge without six tassels and another decorative pattern. This style is an essential accessory for the kilt to hold money, keys, etc.

<text>This list of nearest bright stars is a table of stars found within 15 parsecs (48.9 light-years) of the nearest star, the Sun, that have an absolute magnitude of +8.5 or brighter, which is approximately comparable to a listing of stars more luminous than a red dwarf. Right ascension and declination coordinates are for the epoch J2000. The distance measurements are based on the Hipparcos Catalogue and other astrometric data. In the event of a spectroscopic binary, the combined spectral type and absolute magnitude are listed in &quot;italics&quot;.
The list is ordered by increasing distance.

==Stars within 10 parsecs==
These stars are estimated to be within 32.6 light-years of the Sun.


==Stars between 10 and 13 parsecs==
These stars are estimated to be from 32.7 to 42.4 light years distant from the Sun.


==Stars between 13 and 15 parsecs==
These stars are estimated to be from 42.5 to 48.9 light years distant from the Sun. A value of 48.9 light years corresponds to a minimum parallax of 66.7 mas.

<doc id="902667" wikidata="Q450890" url="?curid=902667" title="Anjem Choudary">
<text>Anjem Choudary (, aka Abu Luqman; born 18 January 1967) is a British Islamist who has been described as &quot;the face&quot; of militant Islamism or the &quot;best known&quot; Islamic extremist in Britain. He was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2024 after being found guilty of directing a terror organisation.

Members of his group have been accused of being linked to between 25 and 40% of terrorist events in Britain up to 2015 according to various researchers, journalists and others, and of inspiring more than 100 foreign fighters to fight in jihad according to the UK government. After staying &quot;just within the law&quot; for many years, in summer of 2014 Choudary pledged allegiance to the Islamic State&#x27;s &quot;caliphate&quot;, and its &quot;caliph&quot; Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi by Skype. Two years later he was convicted under the Terrorism Act 2000 of inviting support for a proscribed organisation, namely the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. He was subsequently subject to sanctions by both the U.S. State Department and the U.N. Security Council freezing his assets. He has been heavily criticised in the UK media.

In 1996, Choudary, with Omar Bakri Muhammad, helped form the Islamist al-Muhajiroun organisation in Britain. The group organised several anti-Western demonstrations, including a banned protest march in London for which Choudary was summoned to appear in court. The UK government banned Al-Muhajiroun in 2010 and Choudary subsequently founded or helped found a series of organizations considered by many to be Al-Muhajiroun under new names—such as Al Guraba&#x27;, Islam4UK, Sharia4UK, Sharia4Belgium. Among the controversial causes espoused and statements made by Choudary and the group include implementation of Sharia throughout the UK, &quot;Europe, and the wider world&quot;; the conversion of famous British landmarks (Buckingham Palace, Nelson&#x27;s Column) into palaces for a caliph, minarets, and mosques; praise for those responsible for the 11 September 2001 and 7 July 2005 attacks; calling for the execution of the Pope for criticizing the Islamic prophet Muhammad; and declaring that Muslims reject the concepts of freedom of expression,&lt;ref name=&quot;Pandey-IBT-8/6/2015&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; democracy, and human rights.

Choudary was convicted of inviting support for a proscribed organisation on 6 September 2016, and was sentenced to five years and six months in prison. He was released automatically on licence in October 2018 with restrictions on speaking in public or to the media. On 18 July 2021, his ban on speaking in public was lifted after his licence ended, and as of October 2021 he had reportedly resumed his online campaigns. Following a further prosecution, he was found guilty in July 2024 of directing a terror organisation (Al-Muhajiroun), after an investigation involving police and intelligence forces in the UK, USA and Canada. On 30 July 2024, he was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 28 years.

==Early life==
Anjem Choudary was born in on 18 January 1967. The son of market trader, his parents were Punjabi Muslims who migrated to what became Pakistan from East Punjab during the Partition of India in 1947. He attended Mulgrave Primary School, in Woolwich.

In 1996, Choudary married Rubana Akhtar (or Akhgar), who had recently joined al-Muhajiroun, which he led at the time. She later became the group&#x27;s head of women. The couple have four children.

He enrolled as a medical student at Barts Medical School. While attending university, he was reputed to have indulged in drink and drugs. Responding to claims that he was a &quot;party animal&quot; who joined his friends in &quot;getting stoned&quot;, in 2014 Choudary commented &quot;I admit that I wasn&#x27;t always practising... I committed many mistakes in my life.&quot;

He switched to law at the University of Southampton and spent his final year as a legal student (1990–1991) at Guildford, before moving to London to teach ESL. He found work at a legal firm and completed his legal qualifications to become a lawyer. In the early 1990s, he worked in his spare time as an organizer for preacher/scholar Omar Bakri Muhammad, who also supported the reestablishment of the Sunni caliphate.

Choudary became the chairman of the Society of Muslim Lawyers, but was removed from the roll of solicitors (the official register of legal practitioners) in 2002.

==Jihadist military training in Britain==
On 7 November 1999, &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; reported that Muslims were receiving weapons training at secret locations in Britain. Most of those who trained at these centres would then fight for Osama bin Laden&#x27;s International Islamic Front in Chechnya, while others would fight in such places as Kosovo, Sudan, Somalia, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Kashmir. The report identified Anjem Choudary as a key figure in recruiting for these training centres.

==Organisations==
Choudary&#x27;s first organization, Al-Muhajiroun, was established in Britain in 1996 and banned in 2010.
Choudary was present at the launch of its intended successor, Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah, and after that he helped form Al Ghurabaa, which was banned in July 2006. Choudary then became the spokesman for Islam4UK until it was proscribed in 2010. While some sources refer to the Al Guraba&#x27;, Islam4UK, etc., as successors of Al-Muhajiroun, others describe them as &quot;other names the organisation [Al-Muhajiroun] goes by&quot; to circumvent the ban on the original group.

===Al-Muhajiroun===
Choudary embraced Islamism and, with the Islamist militant leader Omar Bakri Muhammed, co-founded al-Muhajiroun, a Salafi organisation. The two men had met at a local mosque, where Bakri was giving a tafsir. In 2002, following a bazaar organised by al-Muhajiroun, Choudary gave a talk on education in Slough. His lecture outlined his ideas for a parallel system of Islamic education in the UK and included elements of the group&#x27;s ideology. In the same year, although they were refused a permit by the then Mayor of London Ken Livingstone, on 25 August the group held a rally in London. Choudary was summonsed to Bow Street Magistrates&#x27; Court in January 2003, on charges which included &quot;exhibiting a notice, advertisement or any other written or pictorial matter&quot;, &quot;using apparatus for the amplification of sound&quot;, &quot;making a public speech or address&quot; and &quot;organising an assembly&quot;.

In 2003 or 2004, he organised an Islamic-themed camping trip, at which Bakri lectured, on the grounds of the Jameah Islamiyah School in East Sussex. Advertised by word-of-mouth, the trip was attended by 50 Muslim men, most of whom were members of al-Muhajiroun. Bakri later claimed the camp&#x27;s activities included lectures on Islam, football and paintballing. In September 2006, following allegations that it was used in the training and recruitment of terrorists, police searched the school. According to testimony from Al Qaeda suspects held at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, in 1997 and 1998, Abu Hamza and groups of around 30 of his followers held training camps at the school, which included training with AK47 rifles and handguns, and a mock rocket launcher. No arrests were made, and students and faculty were allowed to return on 23 September 2006, the first day of Ramadan.

The UK government had investigated expelling Bakri even before the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, and in July 2003 the headquarters of al-Muhajiroun, and the homes of Bakri and Choudary, were raided by the police. The following year, under new anti-terrorist legislation, the government announced that it wanted to ban al-Muhajiroun. In 2005, Bakri learned that he was at risk of prosecution for his support of the 7 July 2005 London bombers, and in August left the UK for Lebanon, where he claimed that he was on holiday. After leaving a television station where he said &quot;I will not return to Britain unless I want to go there as a visitor or as a tourist&quot;, he was detained by Lebanon&#x27;s general security department and held in a Beirut prison. Several days later, Bakri was excluded from returning to Britain by the Home Secretary, Charles Clarke, on the grounds that his presence in Britain was &quot;not conducive to the public good.&quot; Choudary condemned the decision and demanded to know what Bakri had done to justify the ban. He claimed that ministers were inventing rules to ensure that Bakri could not return. In November, Choudary and three other followers of Bakri were deported from Lebanon and returned to the UK. Choudary blamed the Foreign and Commonwealth Office for orchestrating their deportations, claiming that the four were there to help Bakri set up a madrasah.

Following his deportation, Choudary attended the launch in London of Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah, the intended successor organisation to al-Muhajiroun. Choudary said that Bakri was not on the committee of the new group, but that &quot;we would love for the sheikh to have a role.&quot; The organisation operates mainly through an invitation-only internet forum, to which Choudary contributes under the screen name Abou Luqman. A reporter visiting the site found calls for holy war, and recordings by Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and Omar Bakri Mohammed.

Al-Muhajiroun attempted a relaunch in June 2009 at Conway Hall, in Holborn. Several speakers were invited to share a platform with Choudary, but some later claimed that they had been invited under false pretences. When the group refused to allow women into the meeting, the chairman of the society that runs the hall cancelled the event. He was heckled by many of those in the audience. Choudary took the microphone from the chairman and led chants of &quot;Sharia for UK&quot;, saying in reference to the exclusion of women: &quot;Jews and Christians will never make peace with you until you either become like them or adopt their ways.&quot; Outside the hall, Choudary criticised British society, predicting that Muslims would make up the majority within one or two decades. When asked why, if society were so bad, he lived here, he replied: &quot;We come here to civilise people, get them to come out of the darkness and injustice into the beauty of Islam.&quot;

===Al Ghurabaa===
Choudary was also a spokesman for Al Ghurabaa, believed to have been an offshoot of al-Muhajiroun. It was proscribed in 2006 by the then Home Secretary John Reid. Choudary was outraged: &quot;The easy option when one is losing an argument is to ban the opposition voice. ... We [al-Ghurabaa] are not a military organisation; we have only been vociferous in our views—views concerning everything from the government&#x27;s foreign policy in Iraq and Afghanistan to the host of draconian laws, which they&#x27;ve introduced against us in this country.&quot;

===Islam4UK===
In November 2008, Choudary organised a meeting of the then recently formed Islam4UK, which, according to its website, was &quot;established by sincere Muslims as a platform to propagate the supreme Islamic ideology within the United Kingdom as a divine alternative to man-made law&quot;, and to &quot;convince the British public about the superiority of Islam ... thereby changing public opinion in favour of Islam in order to transfer the authority and power ... to the Muslims in order to implement the Sharee&#x27;ah (here in Britain)&quot;.

According to Ed Husain, co-founder of the counter-terrorism think-tank the Quilliam Foundation, Islam4UK was a &quot;splinter group of al-Muhajiroun and Hizb ut-Tahrir, the originators of extremism in Britain.&quot; Islam4UK was &quot;previously known as al-Muhajiroun, al-Ghurabaa and Muslims Against Crusades&quot;, according to the Dutch intelligence agency AIVD. The meeting, advertised as a conference to &quot;rise to defend the honour of the Muslims&quot;, was held at the Brady Arts and Community Centre in Tower Hamlets. Choudary then announced that Bakri would be speaking, via a video-conference link, although technical problems meant that his address was instead given over a telephone line. When asked by a Muslim woman how the comments of one of the event&#x27;s speakers could be justified, with regard to Islam being a religion of peace, Choudary stated, &quot;Islam is not a religion of peace ... It is a religion of submission. We need to submit to the will of Allah.&quot;

With the announcement by Islam4UK that it planned to hold a protest march through Wootton Bassett (known for the military funeral repatriations of dead British soldiers returning from the war in Afghanistan), Choudary said &quot;You may see one or two coffins being returned to the UK every other day, but when you think about the people of Afghanistan its a huge number [being killed] in comparison ... I intend to write a letter to the parents of British soldiers telling them the reality of what they died for.&quot; Choudary&#x27;s open letter was published on 3 January 2010. It explained his reasons for proposing the march, endorsed his religious beliefs, and claimed that UK politicians had been lying about the war. Choudary wrote that the proposed march was to &quot;engage the British public&#x27;s minds on the real reasons why their soldiers are returning home in body bags and the real cost of the war.&quot; In an interview with Sky News, he stated that the location was chosen to effect a level of media attention which &quot;it would not have gained anywhere else&quot;. The proposal was condemned by the British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, who said that to offend the families of dead or wounded troops would be &quot;completely inappropriate&quot;. The Minhaj-ul-Quran International UK centre in Forest Gate also condemned the proposal, as did the Muslim Council of Britain, which stated that it &quot;condemns the call by the fringe extremist group Islam4UK for their proposed march in Wootton Bassett.&quot; The planned march was cancelled by the group on 10 January 2010.

From 14 January 2010, Islam4UK was proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000, making membership illegal and punishable by imprisonment. Choudary condemned the order. In an interview on BBC Radio he said &quot;we are now being targeted as an extremist or terrorist organisation and even banned for merely expressing that&quot; and &quot;I feel this is a failure of the concept of democracy and freedom.&quot; Following his arrest and subsequent release in September 2014 on suspicion of encouraging terrorism, Choudary claimed he was questioned about his membership of or support for proscribed groups including Islam4UK and Need4Khalifah, both of which the government believes are successors to al-Muhajiroun.

==Activism==
Choudary has regularly attended public marches and, following a protest march outside the Danish Embassy in London on 3 February 2006, held in response to the &quot;Jyllands-Posten&quot; Muhammad cartoons controversy. As a member of a panel of interviewees on the BBC news programme &quot;Newsnight&quot; he claimed that the police had inspected and allowed the controversial placards used in the demonstration. Choudary was criticised by his fellow panellists, who included Ann Cryer (then MP for Keighley), Humera Khan (al-Nisa Muslim Women&#x27;s Group, who accused him of demonising Islam), Sayeeda Warsi (vice-chair of the Conservative Party), Professor Tariq Ramadan (who claimed that Choudary&#x27;s actions were designed to evoke a strong response from the media), and Roger Knapman (leader of the UK Independence Party).

On 15 March 2006, he was among five men arrested in connection with the demonstration, which had been organised by al Ghurabaa. He was arrested again on 4 May at Stansted Airport for an alleged breach of bail, and charged with organising the protest without notifying police. He was bailed to appear before Bow Street Magistrates&#x27; Court on 11 May. On 4 July 2006 he was convicted and fined £500 with £300 court costs.

The following day, at an Al Ghurabaa press conference at the Al Badr centre in Leyton, Choudary claimed that the blame for the London bombings lay with the British government, and said that the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, had &quot;blood on his hands&quot;. He also urged Muslims to defend themselves against perceived attacks by &quot;whatever means they have at their disposal&quot;, and referred to the 2 June 2006 Forest Gate raid in which Mohammed Abdul Kahar was shot in the shoulder. He encouraged Muslims not to cooperate with the police under any circumstances. Local council leader Clyde Loakes criticised Choudary&#x27;s comments, stating &quot;I am sure the vast majority of Waltham Forest residents do not support these views.&quot;

Several days later, on 9 June 2006, Choudary organised a demonstration outside the Forest Gate police station in London, to protest against the arrest of the two Forest Gate men. The men&#x27;s families said that an extremist protest would &quot;only give another opportunity for our community to be portrayed in a negative light&quot; and sent a statement to more than twenty mosques (read to worshippers during prayers) urging them to disassociate themselves from the event. About 35 men and 15 women attended the demonstration.

In September 2006, Pope Benedict XVI gave a speech on the question of the &quot;reasonableness&quot; of the Christian faith, to the University of Regensburg in Germany. In the Regensburg lecture he spoke about rationality in faith, and cited comments by the fourteenth-century Byzantine emperor Manuel II Palaiologos, who, as the Pope put it, said &quot;show me just what Mohamed brought that was new, and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached.&quot; The citation attracted severe criticism from Muslims around the world, including the parliament of Pakistan, which condemned the Pope for his comments and sought an apology from him. Following the speech, on 17 September Choudary led a protest outside Westminster Cathedral, where he told reporters &quot;Whoever insults the message of Mohammed is going to be subject to capital punishment.&quot; The Metropolitan Police investigated his comments, but concluded that &quot;no substantive offences&quot; were committed during the demonstration. The Shadow Home Secretary, David Davis, who had called for action to be taken against Choudary, said: &quot;It is quite disgraceful. It sends out a message to Muslim extremists that we, as a country, do not have the moral courage to stand up to them.&quot; However, unnamed sources claim that UK law enforcement had, on multiple occasions, sufficient evidence to make an arrest. They were prevented from doing so as he was allegedly being monitored by British Security Services.

He attempted to enter France to demonstrate against the French government&#x27;s decision to ban the burka, but was stopped at the port of Calais. His passport was seized and he was issued documents banning him from France indefinitely.

On 13 December 2013, Choudary led a march in Brick Lane, organised by the east London-based Sharia Project, demanding a ban on alcohol being sold by Muslim establishments. An East London Mosque official, speaking of the patrols, identified The Shariah Project as &quot;strongly linked&quot; to Anjem Choudary&#x27;s banned group Al-Muhajiroun. Abu Rumaysah of The Shariah Project had predicted &quot;hundreds&quot; would join the demonstration, claiming that groups of Muslims would come from as far away as the Midlands to take part. In the event, only a few dozen protesters took part in the march.

Choudary afterwards explained its purpose: &quot;What we did is we posted a notice to the shop owners saying that under Sharia and under the Koran the sale of alcohol is prohibited and if one were to also drink alcohol, that would be 40 lashes. We were there to teach them that just because they are living among non-Muslims is no excuse because Sharia law will be implemented in Britain, and so they should be aware that just because it is not Sharia today, they can&#x27;t just do whatever they like.&quot; He said the Shariah Project group would be arranging many more such rallies.

==Support for ISIS and conviction==
For decades, Choudary had &quot;stayed [on] the right side of the law&quot;—other than a minor conviction for failing to notify police of a demonstration. But in June 2014, the terror group ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) broke through the border between Syria and Iraq. They declared their leader a caliph, their law Sharia, and themselves &quot;The&quot; Islamic State. Since Choudary had called for the establishment of an Islamic state for many years in his lectures, &quot;he came under intense sustained pressure from his acolytes&quot;, to declare his support for the new state. In a private social media message, one supporter, Abu Rumaysah al-Britani, demanded, &quot;We have to declare our position – enough stalling!&quot; Shortly afterwards, Choudary pledged allegiance to the Islamic State&#x27;s &quot;caliphate,&quot; and its &quot;caliph&quot; (Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi) &quot;&#x27;via Skype, text and phone&#x27; during dinner at a restaurant in London.&quot;

But there were legal implications to swearing allegiance. Journalist Dominic Casciani pointed out that Choudary might circumvent laws on terrorism if &quot;he was supporting a political concept&quot; (&quot;an&quot; Islamic state) – &quot;not the proscribed terrorist group behind it&quot; (&quot;the&quot; Islamic State). Choudary believed he had, but British detectives &quot;found the evidence — including a crucial IS oath of allegiance published by one of his Indonesian supporters that could be traced back to private social media conversations&quot;.

On 5 August 2015, Choudary was charged with one offence under section 12 of the Terrorism Act 2000 for inviting support of a proscribed organisation, namely Islamic State, between June 2014 and March 2015. The trial was postponed to 27 June 2016, and was expected to last no more than four weeks. Choudary was convicted on 28 July 2016. At the Old Bailey on 6 September 2016, Mr Justice Holroyde sentenced Choudary to five years and six months in prison, telling him that he had &quot;crossed the line between the legitimate expression of your own views and a criminal act&quot;.

==Post-release and later conviction for directing a terrorist organisation==
Choudary was released from prison on 19 October 2018. Shortly after his release, it was reported that Choudary would be placed in a probation hostel in London Borough of Camden for six months where he would be required to abide by a number of conditions, such as ban from preaching at or attending certain mosques, he would only be allowed to associate with people who have been approved by the authorities, he would be allowed one phone and was banned from using an internet-enabled device without permission, use of the internet was to be supervised, he was restricted from travel outside Greater London&#x27;s M25 and he was to not be able to leave the UK without permission.

In mid-May 2019, Choudary was released from a probation hostel and began &quot;the gradual process of becoming a free man&quot;. Other members of his organization were also released around that time, and began to &quot;remobilize&quot; their campaign to replace democracy in the UK with a caliphate ruled by Shariah law. Their area of focus (according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;), included East London and Bedfordshire (including the town of Luton). Their methods included &quot;lower-profile tactics, ... encrypted apps&quot;; instead of recruiting with &quot;provocative public preaching and demonstrations&quot;, they now employ &quot;secret internet forums and smaller group meetings in inconspicuous locations&quot;. These meeting are legal if the group holding the meeting uses a name that has not been &quot;identified as that of a terrorist outfit&quot; or otherwise banned.

On 18 July 2021, Choudary&#x27;s ban on speaking in public was lifted—though he was banned from Twitter almost immediately. &quot;The Independent&quot; reported in October 2021 that he had resumed his online campaigns.

On 17 July 2023, Choudary was arrested by Metropolitan Police counter terrorism officers, along with Khaled Hussein of Canada. The investigation was multi-national and had involved the Metropolitan Police&#x27;s counter-terrorism unit, MI5, the New York Police Department and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. On 23 July, Choudary was charged with membership of a proscribed organisation and directing and encouraging support for a proscribed organisation, all contrary to section 56 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Hussein was charged with membership of a proscribed organisation. The court case began in June 2024 and was held at Woolwich Crown Court. On 23 July 2024, he was found guilty of &quot;directing an organisation concerned with the commission of acts of terrorism&quot; and is the first person in the UK to be convicted of this charge. At Woolwich Crown Court on 30 July 2024, Mr Justice Wall sentenced Choudary to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 28 years.

==Views==

Choudary referred to the hijackers in the 11 September attacks as &quot;magnificent martyrs&quot;. In 2003, he said that al-Muhajiroun would &quot;encourage people to fulfil their Islamic duties and responsibilities&quot;, although he also said that the group was a political movement and not responsible for individual actions. In 2004, he said that a terror attack on British soil was &quot;a matter of time&quot;. He refused to condemn the 7 July 2005 London bombings, but accused the Muslim Council of Britain (who had) of &quot;selling their souls to the devil&quot;. He blamed the 2013 murder of Lee Rigby, an off-duty British soldier, on British foreign policy.

Choudary has voiced support for the Muslim community in Somalia, who, he claims, have been &quot;violated&quot; by Christian-backed Ethiopians, and has also called for other members to fight jihad.

&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; describes Choudary as a supporter of &quot;the fundamentalist strain of Islamic teaching known as Salafism&quot;. He believes in the primacy of Islam over all other faiths, and the implementation of Sharia law, in its entirety, in the UK. In 2001, he stated that his allegiance is to Islam, and not a country. He believes that, for a true Muslim, &quot;a British passport is no more than a travel document.&quot;

In October 2006, Choudary addressed an audience at Trinity College, Dublin to oppose the motion that &quot;This house believes that Islamist violence can never be justified&quot;. In February 2008 the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, commented that &quot;as a matter of fact certain provisions of sharia are already recognised in our society and under our law&quot;. Choudary responded by saying that Sharia &quot;has to be adopted wholesale&quot;, and that &quot;it will come either by embracing Islam because it is the fastest growing religion in the country, or by an Islamic country conquering Britain or by elements embracing Islam and imposing it.&quot;

In 2008, Choudary spoke of the &quot;flag of Sharia&quot; flying over Downing Street by 2020, claimed that some Muslim families in east London were having &quot;10 or 12 children each&quot;, and that hundreds were converting to Islam each day. Choudary has spoken against elements of the Christian faith. In December 2008, he posted a sermon on an Islamic website, in which he stated: &quot;Every Muslim has a responsibility to protect his family from the misguidance of Christmas, because its observance will lead to hellfire. Protect your Paradise from being taken away – protect yourself and your family from Christmas&quot;.

In an interview with Iran&#x27;s Press TV (which was subsequently posted online on 11 April 2013), Choudary stated &quot;As Muslims, we reject democracy, we reject secularism, and freedom, and human rights. We reject all of the things that you espouse as being ideals ... There is nothing called a republic in Islam. When we talk about the shari&#x27;a, we are talking about only the shari&#x27;a. We are talking about rejecting the U.N., the IMF, and the World Bank.&quot;

In September 2014, Choudary described Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, as &quot;the caliph of all Muslims and the prince of the believers&quot;.

Facing a court sentence for inciting terrorism, Choudhary wanted to move to the Islamic State, and said that he thought it a much better society in terms of welfare benefits and other factors.

===Rationale for doctrine===
In interviews with Graeme Wood, Choudary gave explanations for some of his beliefs on the necessity of Sharia, terror and caliphate government.

According to Choduary, Sharia provides the best form of law enforcement, because many of its punishments (hand chopping, head chopping, stoning, etc.) though severe, deter crime; while its exemptions (stolen goods must be non-perishable and of significant value, the thief cannot be very poor, etc.) and provisions for preventing false conviction, mean the punishments are seldom enforced, and so demonstrate mercy.

However, &quot;maybe 85% of the Shariah&quot; is &quot;in abeyance until we have &quot;khilafah&quot;&quot; (caliphate). Sharia punishments, for example, cannot be done by vigilantes but require legal system, &quot;with courts and an executive&quot;, which a caliphates provides. While it is true the Islamic State has been criticised for administering stonings, beheadings and amputations at a much higher rate than in classical Muslim times, this is to be expected because &quot;the Islamic State is new and the people living under it have spent many years under &quot;kafir&quot; governments&quot;, so it really should not be &quot;any surprise that they would require correction&quot; 

Another distinction between Islam without a caliphate and Islam with, is that &quot;defensive&quot; jihad can be performed without a caliphate, but &quot;offensive&quot; jihad (&quot;jihad al talab&quot;) to forcibly expand the realm of true Islam into countries ruled by non-Muslims (in fact all countries, since &quot;Muslim&quot; countries are actually ruled by apostates), requires a caliphate. And offensive jihad will not be an option for the caliphate but an obligation. &quot;The caliph must wage war to expand the domain of Islam, or remove obstacles to its practice, at least once a year&quot;, with its goal being world conquest. Because the caliphate should be working to gain territory from neighboring countries, is forbidden by Islamic law (according to Choduary) to have fixed borders with them, and forbidden to have treaties and ceasefires with the enemy lasting more than a decade, (treaties may be renewed but &quot;may not be applied to all enemies at once&quot;).

&quot;Shirk&quot; — polytheism — the worst sin in Islam, is found in a great many things that others might find innocent of that vice (according to Choduary) — diplomacy, sending an ambassador to the United Nations, voting in UK elections. This is because these things &quot;recognize an authority other than God&#x27;s&quot;.

The brutality of terrorism is justified because it leads to &quot;less suffering&quot;. By striking terror into the enemy with slaughter and enslavement, jihadis will hasten victory and thus prevent a long drawn out war with more suffering.

==Terrorist designation and influence==
===Designation===
On 30 March 2017, Choudary was declared a Specially Designated Global Terrorist by the United States Department of State. The designation blocks his assets and prohibits him from engaging in trade or financial transactions with US persons.

On 15 October 2018, Choduary was added into the Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee list of the United Nations Security Council. The designation means that each UN member state is legally obliged to freeze financial assets belonging to Choudary, prevent him from entering or transiting their countries and stop any weapons reaching him.

===Influence===
&quot;It is hard to overstate the role Mr. Choudary has played in motivating Islamic extremists&quot;, in the words of Ceylan Yeğinsu.
According to journalist Graeme Wood, quoting Raffaello Pantucci, &quot;members of Choudary&#x27;s group have been linked to 23 out of 51&quot; terrorist events in Britain as of circa 2015. These include the murder of Lee Rigby in Woolwich in 2013 and the 7 July 2005 bombings in London which killed 52. &quot;The New York Times&quot; estimates Choudary&#x27;s group, was linked to &quot;25% of all Islamist terrorism-related convictions in Britain between 1998 and 2015&quot;.
Usman Khan, a convicted terrorist and the main perpetrator in the London Bridge terrorist attack on 29 November 2019, was said to be a member of his group. In 2019, the BBC reported that Abdul Lathief Jameel Mohamed, one of the attackers in the 2019 Sri Lanka Easter bombings, that killed more than 250 people, was radicalized by Choudary after attending his sermons in the U.K. in 2006.

The British government estimates that &quot;Choudary and his followers&quot; have &quot;inspired or influenced&quot; more than 100 foreign fighters to fight in jihad.
According to the head of Scotland Yard&#x27;s counter-terrorism command, Dean Haydon,
&quot;These men have stayed just within the law for many years, but there is no one within the counter-terrorism world that has any doubts of the influence that they have had, the hate they have spread and the people that they have encouraged to join terrorist organisations.
&quot;Over and over again we have seen people on trial for the most serious offences who have attended lectures or speeches given by these men.&quot;

AIVD, the Dutch intelligence agency, also assessed Choudary &quot;to be a key influence in the spread of the jihadi movement in the Netherlands&quot;. Groups led by Choudary were &quot;the single biggest gateway to terrorism in recent British history&quot;, according to &quot;the leftwing group Hope Not Hate&quot;. In 2013, Hope not Hate presented a report which identified Choudary as &quot;a serious player on the international Islamist scene&quot;, saying that although there was no evidence that he was directly responsible for instigating any terrorist plots, &quot;he helped shape the mindset of many of those behind them&quot; and &quot;through his networks linked them up to terror groups and supporters across the world.&quot; Choudary dismissed the claims as &quot;fanciful&quot;, saying that if they were true, UK security services would have arrested him.

==Public reception and criticism==

Choudary has enjoyed wide exposure in the UK through &quot;frequent media appearances&quot;, and according to Graeme Wood, &quot;accepting absolutely every media request that he receives&quot;.

He has been heavily criticised by most UK newspapers, some of which describe him as an extremist, or radical cleric or preacher. In January 2010, British Muslim &quot;Guardian&quot; contributor Mehdi Hasan wrote: &quot;Is Choudary an Islamic scholar whose views merit attention or consideration? No. Has he studied under leading Islamic scholars? Nope. Does he have any Islamic qualifications or credentials? None whatsoever. So what gives him the right to pontificate on Islam, British Muslims or &#x27;the hellfire&#x27;? Or proclaim himself a &#x27;sharia judge&#x27;?&quot; Hasan also claimed that Choudary was &quot;as unrepresentative of British Muslim opinion, as he is of British anti-war opinion.&quot;

The Conservative Party leader David Cameron said that Choudary &quot;is one of those people who needs to be looked at seriously in terms of the legality of what he&#x27;s saying because he strays, I think, extremely close to the line of encouraging hatred, extremism and violence.&quot;

Salma Yaqoob, then leader of the Respect Party, said in 2010 of Choudary: &quot;He is a bigot whose goal in life is to provoke division. He engages in these provocations because he is deeply hostile to any coming together of Muslims and non-Muslims. For him, the fact that a majority of the British people – Muslim and non-Muslim – oppose the war in Afghanistan is not something to be celebrated, but is something to be feared.&quot;

Rod Liddle, writing in &quot;The Spectator&quot;, said: &quot;Anjem Choudray ... is one of those thick-as-mince gobby little chancers who could only possibly come from Britain.&quot; Conservatives in the United States have also been critical of Choudary. Fox News host Sean Hannity invites Choudary on &quot;regularly&quot; (according to journalist Graeme Wood), where he &quot;plays to type&quot; serving as a &quot;howling weird-beard of radical Islam ... in the villain-hero dichotomy of pro wrestling, a Muslim &#x27;heel&#x27; to Sean Hannity&#x27;s Christian &#x27;face&#x27;.&quot; (Hannity has called Choudary &quot;one sick, miserable, evil S.O.B.&quot; during a segment on his show discussing the 2011 Egyptian protests).

Choudary has been denounced by mainstream Muslim groups. However, in January 2010, Jamie Bartlett, a writer for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, speculated that he might have &quot;some&quot; support among the minority of Muslims in the UK who could be considered to hold similar views. The following year, Peter Oborne, defending Baroness Warsi&#x27;s criticism of how British Muslims have been treated, singled out Choudary as an exception to the majority that were &quot;decent people&quot;. According to journalist Graeme Wood, despite his &quot;genius for publicity&quot;, Choudary has &quot;considerable ignorance&quot; of Islam and the language of its scriptures – Arabic. When &quot;confronted on fine details of Islamic law, his main tactic is to change the subject&quot;. According to Wood, his Muslim critics &quot;destroy&quot; him in public debate, and Wood quotes one British Muslim as saying, &#x27;How the hell he passes himself off as a Shariah court judge, I&#x27;ll never know.&#x27; At least one fellow Islamic State supporter (Musa Cerantonio) has criticized him and his followers on doctrinal grounds—for their acceptance of qiyas (eye-for-an-eye punishment), their veneration of Omar Bakri Muhammad (whom they consider a &quot;mujaddid&quot;), and failure to emigrate to the Islamic State (&quot;we say, &#x27;Some of you have got passports! Why are you still there?&#x27;&quot;).

Tabloid criticism of Islam4UK and Choudary since news of the proposed march first became public has, generally, been vitriolic, calling him a &quot;hate preacher&quot;.

Among the claims made about him is that he collects Jobseeker&#x27;s Allowance (with four children he collects £25,000, or almost US$39,000 per year), and has explained &quot;to followers how to receive government assistance they can use to fund a Muslim holy war&quot;. In a &quot;secretly recorded video&quot; he called the allowance &quot;Jizya&quot; (protection money or tribute paid to Muslims by non-Muslims) &quot;which is ours anyway&quot;.

==Publications==
He has written many pamphlets and articles, including &quot;Human Rights: Comparison between the Declaration of Human Rights and Divine Rights in Islam&quot; and &quot;Groups and Parties in Islam: The Islamic Verdict.&quot;

<doc id="902683" wikidata="Q143977" url="?curid=902683" title="Dental braces">
<text>Dental braces (also known as orthodontic braces, or simply braces) are devices used in orthodontics that align and straighten teeth and help position them with regard to a person&#x27;s bite, while also aiming to improve dental health. They are often used to correct underbites, as well as malocclusions, overbites, open bites, gaps, deep bites, cross bites, crooked teeth, and various other flaws of the teeth and jaw. Braces can be either cosmetic or structural. Dental braces are often used in conjunction with other orthodontic appliances to help widen the palate or jaws and to otherwise assist in shaping the teeth and jaws.

== Process ==

The application of braces moves the teeth as a result of force and pressure on the teeth. Traditionally, four basic elements are used: brackets, bonding material, arch wire, and ligature elastic (also called an &quot;O-ring&quot;). The teeth move when the arch wire puts pressure on the brackets and teeth. Sometimes springs or rubber bands are used to put more force in a specific direction.

Braces apply constant pressure which, over time, moves teeth into the desired positions. The process loosens the tooth after which new bone grows to support the tooth in its new position. This is called bone remodelling. Bone remodelling is a biomechanical process responsible for making bones stronger in response to sustained load-bearing activity and weaker in the absence of carrying a load. Bones are made of cells called osteoclasts and osteoblasts. Two different kinds of bone resorption are possible: direct resorption, which starts from the lining cells of the alveolar bone, and indirect or retrograde resorption, which occurs when the periodontal ligament has been subjected to an excessive amount and duration of compressive stress. Another important factor associated with tooth movement is bone deposition. Bone deposition occurs in the distracted periodontal ligament. Without bone deposition, the tooth will loosen, and voids will occur distal to the direction of tooth movement.

== Types ==

* &quot;Traditional metal wired braces&quot; (also known as &quot;train track braces&quot;) are stainless-steel and are sometimes used in combination with titanium. Traditional metal braces are the most common type of braces. These braces have a metal bracket with elastic ties (also known as rubber bands) holding the wire onto the metal brackets. The second-most common type of braces is self-ligating braces, which have a built-in system to secure the archwire to the brackets and do not require elastic ties. Instead, the wire goes through the bracket. Often with this type of braces, treatment time is reduced, there is less pain on the teeth, and fewer adjustments are required than with traditional braces.
* Gold-plated stainless steel braces are often employed for patients allergic to nickel (a basic and important component of stainless steel), but may also be chosen for aesthetic reasons.
* &quot;Lingual braces&quot; are a cosmetic alternative in which custom-made braces are bonded to the back of the teeth making them externally invisible. 
* &quot;Titanium braces&quot; resemble stainless-steel braces but are lighter and just as strong. People with allergies to nickel in steel often choose titanium braces, but they are more expensive than stainless steel braces.
* Customized orthodontic treatment systems combine high technology including 3-D imaging, treatment planning software and a robot to custom bend the wire. Customized systems such as this offer faster treatment times and more efficient results. 
* Progressive, clear removable aligners may be used to gradually move teeth into their final positions. Aligners are generally not used for complex orthodontic cases, such as when extractions, jaw surgery, or palate expansion are necessary.

== Fitting procedure ==

Orthodontic services may be provided by any licensed dentist trained in orthodontics. In North America, most orthodontic treatment is done by orthodontists, who are dentists in the diagnosis and treatment of &quot;malocclusions&quot;—malalignments of the teeth, jaws, or both. A dentist must complete 2–3 years of additional post-doctoral training to earn a specialty certificate in orthodontics. There are many general practitioners who also provide orthodontic services.

The first step is to determine whether braces are suitable for the patient. The doctor consults with the patient and inspects the teeth visually. If braces are appropriate, a records appointment is set up where X-rays, moulds, and impressions are made. These records are analyzed to determine the problems and the proper course of action. The use of digital models is rapidly increasing in the orthodontic industry. Digital treatment starts with the creation of a three-dimensional digital model of the patient&#x27;s arches. This model is produced by laser-scanning plaster models created using dental impressions. Computer-automated treatment simulation has the ability to automatically separate the gums and teeth from one another and can handle malocclusions well; this software enables clinicians to ensure, in a virtual setting, that the selected treatment will produce the optimal outcome, with minimal user input.

Typical treatment times vary from six months to two and a half years depending on the complexity and types of problems. Orthognathic surgery may be required in extreme cases. About 2 weeks before the braces are applied, orthodontic spacers may be required to spread apart back teeth in order to create enough space for the bands.

Teeth to be braced will have an adhesive applied to help the cement bond to the surface of the tooth. In most cases, the teeth will be banded and then brackets will be added. A bracket will be applied with dental cement, and then cured with light until hardened. This process usually takes a few seconds per tooth. If required, orthodontic spacers may be inserted between the molars to make room for molar bands to be placed at a later date. Molar bands are required to ensure brackets will stick. Bands are also utilized when dental fillings or other dental works make securing a bracket to a tooth infeasible. Orthodontic tubes (stainless steel tubes that allow wires to pass through them), also known as molar tubes, are directly bonded to molar teeth either by a chemical curing or a light curing adhesive. Usually, molar tubes are directly welded to bands, which is a metal ring that fits onto the molar tooth. Directly bonded molar tubes are associated with a higher failure rate when compared to molar bands cemented with glass ionomer cement. Failure of orthodontic brackets, bonded tubes or bands will increase the overall treatment time for the patient. There is evidence suggesting that there is less enamel decalcification associated with molar bands cemented with glass ionomer cement compared with orthodontic tubes directly cemented to molars using a light cured adhesive. Further evidence is needed to withdraw a more robust conclusion due to limited data.

An archwire will be threaded between the brackets and affixed with elastic or metal ligatures. Ligatures are available in a wide variety of colours, and the patient can choose which colour they like. Arch wires are bent, shaped, and tightened frequently to achieve the desired results.

Modern orthodontics makes frequent use of nickel-titanium archwires and temperature-sensitive materials. When cold, the archwire is limp and flexible, easily threaded between brackets of any configuration. Once heated to body temperature, the arch wire will stiffen and seek to retain its shape, creating constant light force on the teeth.

Brackets with hooks can be placed, or hooks can be created and affixed to the arch wire to affix rubber bands. The placement and configuration of the rubber bands will depend on the course of treatment and the individual patient. Rubber bands are made in different diameters, colours, sizes, and strengths. They are also typically available in two versions: Coloured or clear/opaque.

The fitting process can vary between different types of braces, though there are similarities such as the initial steps of moulding the teeth before application. For example, with clear braces, impressions of a patient&#x27;s teeth are evaluated to create a series of trays, which fit to the patient&#x27;s mouth almost like a protective mouthpiece. With some forms of braces, the brackets are placed in a special form that is customized to the patient&#x27;s mouth, drastically reducing the application time.

In many cases, there is insufficient space in the mouth for all the teeth to fit properly. There are two main procedures to make room in these cases. One is extraction: teeth are removed to create more space. The second is expansion, in which the palate or arch is made larger by using a palatal expander. Expanders can be used with both children and adults. Since the bones of adults are already fused, expanding the palate is not possible without surgery to separate them. An expander can be used on an adult without surgery but would be used to expand the dental arch, and not the palate.

Sometimes children and teenage patients, and occasionally adults, are required to wear a headgear appliance as part of the primary treatment phase to keep certain teeth from moving (for more detail on headgear and facemask appliances see Orthodontic headgear). When braces put pressure on one&#x27;s teeth, the periodontal membrane stretches on one side and is compressed on the other. This movement needs to be done slowly or otherwise, the patient risks losing their teeth. This is why braces are worn as long as they are and adjustments are only made every so often.

Braces are typically adjusted every three to six weeks. This helps shift the teeth into the correct position. When they get adjusted, the orthodontist removes the coloured or metal ligatures keeping the arch wire in place. The arch wire is then removed and may be replaced or modified. When the archwire has been placed back into the mouth, the patient may choose a colour for the new elastic ligatures, which are then affixed to the metal brackets. The adjusting process may cause some discomfort to the patient, which is normal.

Patients may need post-orthodontic surgery, such as a fiberotomy or alternatively a gum lift, to prepare their teeth for retainer use and improve the gumline contours after the braces come off. After braces treatment, patients can use a transparent plate to keep the teeth in alignment for a certain period of time. After treatment, patients usually use transparent plates for 6 months. In patients with long and difficult treatment, a fixative wire is attached to the back of the teeth to prevent the teeth from returning to their original state.

=== Retainers ===
In order to prevent the teeth from moving back to their original position, retainers are worn once the treatment is complete. Retainers help in maintaining and stabilizing the position of teeth long enough to permit the reorganization of the supporting structures after the active phase of orthodontic therapy. If the patient does not wear the retainer appropriately and/or for the right amount of time, the teeth may move towards their previous position. For regular braces, Hawley retainers are used. They are made of metal hooks that surround the teeth and are enclosed by an acrylic plate shaped to fit the patient&#x27;s palate. For Clear Removable braces, an Essix retainer is used. This is similar to the original aligner; it is a clear plastic tray that is firmly fitted to the teeth and stays in place without a plate fitted to the palate. There is also a bonded retainer where a wire is permanently bonded to the lingual side of the teeth, usually the lower teeth only.

=== Headgear ===

Headgear needs to be worn between 12 and 22 hours each day to be effective in correcting the overbite, typically for 12 to 18 months depending on the severity of the overbite, how much it is worn and what growth stage the patient is in. Typically the prescribed daily wear time will be between 14 and 16 hours a day and is frequently used as a post-primary treatment phase to maintain the position of the jaw and arch. Headgear can be used during the night while the patient sleeps.

Orthodontic headgear usually consists of three major components:

# Facebow: the facebow (or J-Hooks) is fitted with a metal arch onto headgear tubes attached to the rear upper and lower molars. This facebow then extends out of the mouth and around the patient&#x27;s face. J-Hooks are different in that they hook into the patient&#x27;s mouth and attach directly to the brace (see photo for an example of J-Hooks).
# Head cap: the head cap typically consists of one or a number of straps fitting around the patient&#x27;s head. This is attached with elastic bands or springs to the facebow. Additional straps and attachments are used to ensure comfort and safety (see photo).
# Attachment: typically consisting of rubber bands, elastics, or springs—joins the facebow or J-Hooks and the head cap together, providing the force to move the upper teeth, jaw backwards.
The headgear application is one of the most useful appliances available to the orthodontist when looking to correct a Class II malocclusion. See more details in the section Orthodontic headgear.

=== Pre-finisher ===
The pre-finisher is moulded to the patient&#x27;s teeth by use of extreme pressure on the appliance by the person&#x27;s jaw. The product is then worn a certain amount of time with the user applying force to the appliance in their mouth for 10 to 15 seconds at a time. The goal of the process is to increase the exercise time in applying the force to the appliance. If a person&#x27;s teeth are not ready for a proper retainer the orthodontist may prescribe the use of a preformed finishing appliance such as the pre-finisher. This appliance fixes gaps between the teeth, small spaces between the upper and lower jaw, and other minor problems.

== Complications and risks ==
A group of dental researchers, Fatma Boke, Cagri Gazioglu, Selvi Akkaya, and Murat Akkaya, conducted a study titled &quot;Relationship between orthodontic treatment and gingival health.&quot; The results indicated that some orthodontist treatments result in gingivitis, also known as gum disease. The researchers concluded that functional appliances used to harness natural forces (such as improving the alignment of bites) do not usually have major effects on the gum after treatment. However, fixed appliances such as braces, which most people get, can result in visible plaque, visible inflammation, and gum recession in a majority of the patients. The formation of plaques around the teeth of patients with braces is almost inevitable regardless of plaque control and can result in mild gingivitis. But if someone with braces does not clean their teeth carefully, plaques will form, leading to more severe gingivitis and gum recession.

Experiencing some pain following fitting and activation of fixed orthodontic braces is very common and several methods have been suggested to tackle this. Pain associated with orthodontic treatment increases in proportion to the amount of force that is applied to the teeth. When a force is applied to a tooth via a brace, there is a reduction in the blood supply to the fibres that attach the tooth to the surrounding bone. This reduction in blood supply results in inflammation and the release of several chemical factors, which stimulate the pain response. Orthodontic pain can be managed using pharmacological interventions, which involve the use of analgesics applied locally or systemically. These analgesics are divided into four main categories, including opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), paracetamol and local anesthesia. The first three of these analgesics are commonly taken systemically to reduce orthodontic pain.

A Cochrane Review in 2017 evaluated the pharmacological interventions for pain relief during orthodontic treatment. The study concluded that there was moderate-quality evidence that analgesics reduce the pain associated with orthodontic treatment. However, due to a lack of evidence, it was unclear whether systemic NSAIDs were more effective than paracetamol, and whether topical NSAIDs were more effective than local anaesthesia in the reduction of pain associated with orthodontic treatment. More high-quality research is required to investigate these particular comparisons.

The dental displacement obtained with the orthodontic appliance determines in most cases some degree of root resorption. Only in a few cases is this side effect large enough to be considered real clinical damage to the tooth. In rare cases, the teeth may fall out or have to be extracted due to root resorption.

== History ==

=== Ancient ===

According to scholars and historians, braces date back to ancient times. Around 400–300 BC, Hippocrates and Aristotle contemplated ways to straighten teeth and fix various dental conditions. Archaeologists have discovered numerous mummified ancient individuals with what appear to be metal bands wrapped around their teeth. Catgut, a type of cord made from the natural fibres of an animal&#x27;s intestines, performed a similar role to today&#x27;s orthodontic wire in closing gaps in the teeth and mouth.

The Etruscans buried their dead with dental appliances in place to maintain space and prevent the collapse of the teeth during the afterlife. A Roman tomb was found with a number of teeth bound with gold wire documented as a ligature wire, a small elastic wire that is used to affix the arch wire to the bracket. Even Cleopatra wore a pair. Roman philosopher and physician Aulus Cornelius Celsus first recorded the treatment of teeth by finger pressure. Unfortunately, due to a lack of evidence, poor preservation of bodies, and primitive technology, little research was carried out on dental braces until around the 17th century, although dentistry was making great advancements as a profession by then.

=== 18th century ===

Orthodontics truly began developing in the 18th and 19th centuries. In 1669, French dentist Pierre Fauchard, who is often credited with inventing modern orthodontics, published a book entitled &quot;The Surgeon Dentist&quot; on methods of straightening teeth. Fauchard, in his practice, used a device called a &quot;Bandeau&quot;, a horseshoe-shaped piece of iron that helped expand the palate. In 1754, another French dentist, Louis Bourdet, dentist to the King of France, followed Fauchard&#x27;s book with &quot;The Dentist&#x27;s Art&quot;, which also dedicated a chapter to tooth alignment and application. He perfected the &quot;Bandeau&quot; and was the first dentist on record to recommend extraction of the premolar teeth to alleviate crowding and improve jaw growth.

=== 19th century ===
Although teeth and palate straightening and/or pulling were used to improve the alignment of remaining teeth and had been practised since early times, orthodontics, as a science of its own, did not really exist until the mid-19th century. Several important dentists helped to advance dental braces with specific instruments and tools that allowed braces to be improved.

In 1819, Christophe François Delabarre introduced the wire crib, which marked the birth of contemporary orthodontics, and gum elastics were first employed by Maynard in 1843. Tucker was the first to cut rubber bands from rubber tubing in 1850. Dentist, writer, artist, and sculptor Norman William Kingsley in 1858 wrote the first article on orthodontics and in 1880, his book, &quot;Treatise on Oral Deformities&quot;, was published. A dentist named John Nutting Farrar is credited for writing two volumes entitled, &quot;A Treatise on the Irregularities of the Teeth and Their Corrections&quot; and was the first to suggest the use of mild force at timed intervals to move teeth.

=== 20th century ===
In the early 20th century, Edward Angle devised the first simple classification system for malocclusions, such as Class I, Class II, and so on. His classification system is still used today as a way for dentists to describe how crooked teeth are, what way teeth are pointing, and how teeth fit together. Angle contributed greatly to the design of orthodontic and dental appliances, making many simplifications. He founded the first school and college of orthodontics, organized the American Society of Orthodontia in 1901 which became the American Association of Orthodontists (AAO) in the 1930s, and founded the first orthodontic journal in 1907. Other innovations in orthodontics in the late 19th and early 20th centuries included the first textbook on orthodontics for children, published by J.J. Guilford in 1889, and the use of rubber elastics, pioneered by Calvin S. Case, along with Henry Albert Baker.

Today, space age wires (also known as dental arch wires) are used to tighten braces. In 1959, the Naval Ordnance Laboratory created an alloy of nickel and titanium called Nitinol. NASA further studied the material&#x27;s physical properties. In 1979, Dr. George Andreasen developed a new method of fixing braces with the use of the Nitinol wires based on their superelasticity. Andreasen used the wire on some patients and later found out that he could use it for the entire treatment. Andreasen then began using the nitinol wires for all his treatments and as a result, dental doctor visits were reduced, the cost of dental treatment was reduced, and patients reported less discomfort.

<doc id="902685" wikidata="Q120995" url="?curid=902685" title="Grubenmann">
<text>Several members of the Swiss family Grubenmann were famous as carpenters and civil engineers in the 18th century. The sons were innovators in bridge construction.

 (1668 – 27 June 1736) lived all his life in Gstalden, Appenzell Ausserrhoden where he fathered three sons:
* (10 January 1694 – 5 October 1758), died in Hombrechtikon, Zürich;
*[[Johannes Grubenmann]] (15 June 1707 – 10 June 1771), died in Teufen; and
* (23 March 1709 – 22 January 1783), died in Teufen.

The brothers were village carpenters in Teufen. The principal structures are known to be:
*Crossing of the Rhine at Schaffhausen in two spans of 52 m and 59 m respectively, (Hans Ulrich, 1757);
*A single-span of 67 m at Reichenau, (Johannes, 1757);
*Crossing of the Limmat at Wettingen, a 60 m span thought to be the first use of a true arch in a timber bridge, (Hans Ulrich and Johannes, 1778).

Very few of their bridges have survived, those at Schaffhausen and Wettingen being burnt by the French in the war of 1799, but their designs were influential, making use of novel combinations of arches and trusses. The surviving bridges include:
*Rümlangbrücke, Oberglatt, 27.5 m span
*Hundwilertobel, 30 m span
*Kubelbrücke, Herisau, 30 m span

<text>U.S. Route 222 (US 222) is a U.S. Highway that is a spur of US 22 in the states of Maryland and Pennsylvania. It runs for from US 1 in Conowingo, Maryland, north to the junction of Interstate 78 (I-78) and Pennsylvania Route 309 (PA 309) in Dorneyville, Pennsylvania. US 222 is almost entirely in Pennsylvania, and serves as the state&#x27;s principal artery between the Lancaster and Reading areas in the west and the Lehigh Valley in the east.

US 222 heads north from US 1 in Conowingo and soon crosses from Maryland into Pennsylvania, continuing north through rural areas and passing through Quarryville and Willow Street before reaching Lancaster. The route passes through Lancaster on a one-way pair of city streets before becoming a freeway at US 30 north of the city. The US 222 freeway heads northeast, crossing US 322 in Ephrata and coming to an indirect interchange with the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-76).

US 222 bypasses Reading to the west, where it forms a concurrency with US 422. The freeway section ends past Reading and the route continues northeast through rural areas, with a freeway bypass of Kutztown. US 222 bypasses Trexlertown on a multilane divided expressway before coming to its northern terminus at I-78/PA 309 in Dorneyville, where the road continues into Allentown as PA 222.

==Route description==
===Conowingo to Lancaster===

US 222 begins at an intersection with US 1 in Conowingo in Cecil County, Maryland. Following US 1 southwest to the Conowingo Dam across the Susquehanna River leads to the northern terminus of MD 222. From this intersection, the route heads northwest on two-lane undivided Rock Springs Road, passing through a mix of fields and woods with some homes. The road curves to the north through woodland and passes east of Oakwood. US 222 turns to the northeast and runs through fields and woods with some development, passing to the southeast of the Rock Springs Generation Facility in Rock Springs before it comes to the Mason–Dixon line, which marks the border between Maryland and Pennsylvania.

Upon crossing the Mason–Dixon line, US 222 enters Fulton Township in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and heads north as Robert Fulton Highway, passing between woodland to the west and farm fields to the east. The route turns to the north-northwest and runs through agricultural areas with some trees and homes, passing through New Texas Lyles. The road continues through rural areas and curves to the north, heading into Wakefield and coming to an intersection with PA 272. At this point, PA 272 turns north for a concurrency with US 222 along Robert Fulton Highway, running through a mix of farms and homes. PA 272 splits from US 222 in Penn Hill by heading northwest, and US 222 continues northeast through wooded areas. The road heads into a mix of fields and woods and reaches Goshen, where it turns to the north. The route runs through farmland with some woods and homes, curving northeast before heading back to the north and passing to the east of the Robert Fulton Birthplace. US 222 continues north-northeast through rural land and passes through Bethel, where it crosses into Little Britain Township. The road heads north and enters East Drumore Township, continuing through farmland with some trees and residences and passing through the communities of Unicorn and Mechanics Grove. The route passes east of Solanco High School and bends to the north-northwest as it runs through more rural land.

US 222 enters the borough of Quarryville and becomes South Church Street, heading north past homes. The route comes to an intersection with PA 372, at which point it turns west-southwest to join that route on West State Street, running through more residential areas. US 222 splits from PA 372 by heading northwest onto West 4th Street, passing between businesses to the southwest and homes to the northeast before running through more residential areas, cutting through a corner of East Drumore Township before heading into Providence Township. At this point, the route enters the Pennsylvania Dutch Country of eastern Lancaster County, which is home to many Amish farms. In Providence Township, the route becomes Beaver Valley Pike and passes under the Enola Low Grade Trail before it runs through a mix of farmland, woodland, and residential and commercial development. The road crosses the Big Beaver Creek into Strasburg Township and heads northwest through more rural land with some development, with the creek parallel to the southwest. The creek bends away to the west and US 222 continues into agricultural areas with occasional homes, passing through Martinsville and turning to the west-northwest. The route passes to the northeast of Refton and curves northwest, crossing the Pequea Creek into West Lampeter Township. The road heads north through farmland and bends northwest to reach an intersection with PA 741. Here, PA 741 becomes concurrent with US 222 and the two routes curve to the west-southwest, passing between farm fields to the north and residential and commercial development to the south and heading into Willow Street, where the road comes to an intersection with PA 272, which is split into a one-way pair at this point.

At this point, US 222 splits from PA 741 by turning north to join PA 272 along Willow Street Pike, a one-way pair which carries two lanes in each direction. PA 272 becomes unsigned along the US 222 concurrency. Both directions of Willow Street Pike rejoin and it continues north as a two-lane undivided road past commercial development before it runs through wooded residential areas, passing through Hollinger. US 222/PA 272 crosses Mill Creek and heads through Lyndon. The road briefly gains a center left-turn lane as it continues through wooded areas of development and passes to the west of a golf course. US 222/PA 272 splits into a one-way pair, with two lanes in each direction, and crosses the Conestoga River into Lancaster Township.

===Lancaster to Reading===

After crossing the Conestoga River, northbound US 222/PA 272 becomes Highland Avenue and southbound US 222/PA 272 is called South Prince Street. The southbound direction intersects PA 324 in Engleside before the two routes continue into the city of Lancaster, heading into urban residential and commercial areas. A short distance after entering Lancaster, northbound US 222/PA 272 intersects the end of one-way northbound PA 324 and heads onto South Queen Street. The two routes continues past urban rowhouses along South Queen Street northbound and South Prince Street southbound, with South Queen Street passing to the west of Woodward Hill Cemetery. Northbound US 222/PA 272 splits from South Queen Street by heading northeast onto Church Street, which carries three lanes of one-way traffic, while northbound PA 72 starts along South Queen Street. Just south of downtown Lancaster, the northbound direction of the route turns north onto South Lime Street, which carries two lanes of one-way traffic. US 222/PA 272 heads into the commercial downtown of Lancaster and crosses eastbound PA 462 at King Street. Past this, the route becomes North Lime Street northbound and North Prince Street southbound, crossing eastbound PA 23 at Chestnut Street and westbound PA 23/PA 462 at Walnut Street. The two routes leave the downtown area and run through urban areas of homes and businesses. The northbound direction passes to the east of Lancaster General Hospital between East James and East Frederick streets while the southbound direction passes to the east of Clipper Magazine Stadium, home of the Lancaster Stormers baseball team, north of the Harrisburg Avenue/West James Street intersection. At the intersection with Liberty Street, northbound US 222/PA 272 shifts west a block onto four-lane undivided North Duke Street, a two-way road, while the one-way pair continues into Manheim Township. A block later, at McGovern Avenue, both directions of US 222/PA 272 rejoin along North Duke Street. Southbound US 222/PA 272 follows McGovern Avenue west between North Duke Street and North Prince Street, forming the border between a portion of the city of Lancaster that is home to the Lancaster station along Amtrak&#x27;s Keystone Corridor railroad line to the north and Manheim Township to the south. The roadway is a three-lane road with two westbound lanes that carry southbound US 222/PA 272 and one eastbound lane. McGovern Avenue reaches an intersection with northbound PA 72 at North Queen Street, where northbound PA 72 turns west to join southbound US 222/PA 272 along the road. At North Prince Street, southbound US 222/PA 272 turn south while PA 72 becomes two-way heading north.
Both directions of US 222/PA 272 continue north along four-lane undivided North Duke Street and the road reaches the Thaddeus Stevens Bridge over Amtrak&#x27;s Keystone Corridor, where it becomes the border between Manheim Township to the west and Lancaster to the east. At Keller Avenue, the road name changes to Lititz Pike and it fully enters Manheim Township, running through commercial areas as a five-lane road with a center left-turn lane. Northbound US 222 and PA 272 head northeast onto Oregon Pike, with PA 272 becoming signed again, while southbound US 222 and PA 501 continue north along Lititz Pike. The two routes continue northeast as a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane and runs past businesses and a few homes before it comes to an interchange with the US 30 freeway. Here, US 222 splits from PA 272, which becomes signed again, by heading east concurrent with US 30 on an eight-lane freeway, passing near developed areas. US 222 splits from US 30 at a trumpet interchange and heads north onto a four-lane freeway. The route curves northeast and runs through a mix of farmland and residential and commercial development. The freeway comes to a northbound exit and entrance with Butter Road, which provides access to PA 272 via Jake Landis Road, and a southbound exit and entrance with PA 272. Past this interchange, US 222 continues through a mix of farm fields and woodland, passing through a corner of Warwick Township before crossing the Cocalico Creek into West Earl Township.

The route passes near farmland before heading near homes and businesses, reaching a partial cloverleaf interchange with PA 772 north of Brownstown. Past here, the freeway runs northeast through agricultural areas. Farther along, US 222 curves to the north and comes to a diverging diamond interchange with US 322 southeast of the borough of Ephrata, at which point it crosses into Ephrata Township. The route passes near businesses at the interchange before it turns northeast and runs through wooded areas with some nearby residential development and farm fields. The freeway heads into East Cocalico Township and runs through more woodland before it passes to the southeast of Reamstown. US 222 passes through farmland and comes to a diamond interchange with Colonel Howard Boulevard, which heads west to provide access to PA 272 and east to provide access to the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-76). Following this, the route passes over the Pennsylvania Turnpike and crosses into Brecknock Township, running through a mix of farm fields and woods with some nearby residential and commercial development as it passes to the southeast of the borough of Adamstown.

The US 222 freeway enters Brecknock Township in Berks County and continues north, passing a northbound weigh station before coming to a partial cloverleaf interchange serving the northern terminus of PA 272 and the western terminus of PA 568. Past this interchange, the route crosses into Spring Township and runs through wooded areas with some fields and homes, curving to the northeast and reaching a diamond interchange at Mohns Hill Road to the west of Gouglersville. Here, the freeway crosses into Cumru Township and runs north-northeast through more rural areas, coming to a diamond interchange that connects to Grings Hill Road west of the borough of Mohnton.

===Reading to Allentown===

A short distance later, US 222 comes to a northbound exit and southbound entrance with the southern terminus of US 222 Bus., a business route that passes through the city of Reading, which US 222 bypasses to the west. From here, the route curves to the north and crosses back into Spring Township, passing near suburban residential development and coming to a partial cloverleaf interchange with PA 724 in a business area. The freeway turns to the northeast and passes through residential areas and some woodland between West Wyomissing to the north and Lincoln Park to the south. US 222 briefly forms the border between Spring Township to the north and the borough of Wyomissing to the south before it bends to the north-northeast into Spring Township. The route crosses into Wyomissing and comes to an interchange with US 422 and the western terminus of US 422 Bus., at which point it also passes over Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Harrisburg Line. At this interchange, US 422 becomes concurrent with US 222, and the two routes continue east-northeast along the six-lane Warren Street Bypass freeway, running between residential areas to the northwest and the Norfolk Southern tracks to the southeast. The freeway curves north into business areas and comes to a partial cloverleaf interchange with State Hill Road. Following this, US 222/US 422 passes between the Berkshire Mall to the west and commercial areas to the east before it reaches an interchange with Paper Mill Road and Crossing Drive, where it curves to the northeast and runs near more businesses. The freeway comes to an interchange where US 222 splits to the northwest, US 422 immediately afterward splits southeast along the West Shore Bypass, and, straight ahead, PA 12 begins northeast along the Warren Street Bypass.

Past this interchange, US 222 heads northwest as a four-lane freeway, crossing back into Spring Township and running between a farm field to the southwest and the Penn State Berks university campus to the northeast before reaching a diamond interchange with Broadcasting Road. The route between US 422 and the northern end of this expressway portion is known as the Outer Bypass, the POW/MIA Memorial Highway by an act of the Pennsylvania General Assembly, or the &quot;Road to Nowhere&quot; as it was known while incomplete and to this day. The route runs between a shopping center to the southwest and Tulpehocken Valley County Park to the northeast prior to reaching the Spring Ridge Drive exit. At this point, the freeway turns north and crosses the Tulpehocken Creek into Bern Township and runs north-northeast through wooded areas with some nearby homes and commercial development, coming to a partial cloverleaf interchange with PA 183. Following this, US 222 curves northeast, passing to the northwest of Reading Regional Airport and running through farm fields before crossing the Schuylkill River into Muhlenberg Township. The route passes near residential neighborhoods and some commercial development, passing over the Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad&#x27;s Reading Division line and reaching a partial cloverleaf interchange with PA 61. The freeway passes under another Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad line and Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Evansville Industrial Track railroad line, crossing into Ontelaunee Township. At this point, US 222 heads northeast through industrial areas, with Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Reading Line parallel to the southeast. The freeway comes to an end at a trumpet interchange, where US 222 intersects the northern terminus of US 222 Bus. and merges onto that road.
From here, US 222 heads north-northeast on four-lane divided Allentown Pike past a few businesses. The route enters Maidencreek Township and becomes a five-lane road with a center left-turn lane, running through a mix of fields and woods with some homes. The road curves northeast and passes commercial development, coming to an intersection with PA 73 in Maiden Creek. Past this intersection, US 222 runs past a mix of residential development and businesses with some farm fields, meeting Tamarack Boulevard/Genesis Drive and Schaeffer Road at a roundabout. At this point, the route narrows to three lanes with a center left-turn lane and heads into the agricultural East Penn Valley in northeastern Berks County, which is home to an Old Order Mennonite community. US 222 continues northeast through farmland with some trees, residences, and businesses, passing through Kirbyville and crossing into Richmond Township, where the name becomes Kutztown Road. Farther northeast, the road heads past businesses and comes to a roundabout with PA 662 in Moselem Springs. US 222 continues through farmland with some development, passing to the southeast of a golf course in Kempville.

The route becomes a four-lane freeway called the Kutztown Bypass, which bypasses the borough of Kutztown to the northwest, with a northbound exit and southbound entrance at Kutztown Road providing access to Kutztown. The freeway heads northeast through agricultural areas and crosses into Maxatawny Township, where it comes to a southbound exit and northbound entrance at Crystal Cave Road that provides access to Crystal Cave and Virginville. From here, the route heads through more rural land before it passes through a section of Kutztown and runs near residential areas and farmland north of the Kutztown University of Pennsylvania campus. US 222 crosses back into Maxatawny Township and curves east, passing over the Sacony Creek and coming to a partial cloverleaf interchange with the southern terminus of PA 737 that provides access to Kutztown. The freeway crosses back into Kutztown and passes near homes before it reenters Maxatawny Township and the Kutztown Bypass ends at a southbound exit and northbound entrance with Kutztown Road that serves the borough. From here, US 222 becomes two-lane undivided Kutztown Road and runs east-northeast through farmland before heading past businesses near the Long Lane intersection. The route gains a center left-turn lane and passes through Monterey before it continues through agricultural areas. Farther east, the road heads into Maxatawny, where it is lined with homes and a few businesses.
US 222 enters Upper Macungie Township in Lehigh County, which is in the Lehigh Valley, and becomes Hamilton Boulevard, a five-lane road with a center left-turn lane that passes through farmland with some businesses and comes to a roundabout with the southern terminus of PA 863, Schantz Road, and Farmington Road. The route narrows to three lanes with a center left-turn lane and continues east through farm fields with some homes and businesses, heading to the south of an office park. Residential and commercial development along the road increases as it passes to the north of Breinigsville. A bit further east, US 222 diverges from Hamilton Boulevard at a northbound exit and southbound entrance onto a four-lane divided expressway called the Frederick J. Jaindl Jr. Memorial Highway, immediately reaching a partial interchange with the PA 100 bypass of Trexlertown, where Hamilton Boulevard continues east into Trexlertown, northbound US 222 merges with northbound PA 100, and southbound US 222 splits from southbound PA 100. All other connections between PA 100 and US 222 are provided by Hamilton Boulevard and Weilers Road. US 222 and PA 100 continue north concurrent along the expressway, passing near homes and intersecting Grim Road/Cetronia Road at-grade. The road curves northeast and runs between warehouses to the northwest and housing developments to the southeast. PA 100 splits from US 222 at a diamond interchange, at which point PA 100 continues north and Trexlertown Road heads south. US 222 continues past industrial areas and farmland, coming to a bridge over Norfolk Southern&#x27;s C&amp;F Secondary. The route bends east and runs past more farmland before heading near residential neighborhoods, crossing over Cetronia Road on a bridge before intersecting Grange Road/Mill Creek Road at-grade.

US 222 crosses into Lower Macungie Township and curves to the east-northeast, passing north of a shopping center and intersecting North Krocks Road at an at-grade intersection with a northbound exit and entrance ramp for right turns and access to and from the shopping center. Past this, the route has a southbound exit to Brookside Road north of Wescosville. The road comes to a bridge over the Pennsylvania Turnpike Northeast Extension (I-476) and runs between industrial development to the north and businesses to the south, reaching an intersection with Hamilton Boulevard and Cedarbrook Road/Kressler Road. Here, US 222 widens to six lanes and becomes Hamilton Boulevard again, heading east-northeast to the north of a park and ride lot before it comes to its northern terminus at a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-78/PA 309 in Dorneyville. Past this interchange, Hamilton Boulevard continues as PA 222 toward the city of Allentown.

==History==
The first stretch of highway between Perryville and Conowingo in Maryland that became part of US 222 to be improved was in Perryville, where Cecil County constructed with state aid a macadam road from the Aikin station on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad south toward the Post Road, which is present-day MD 7, by 1910. Cecil County extended the macadam road to the Post Road by 1919. The highway from the Aikin railroad crossing to Port Deposit was paved as a concrete road in two sections: from the railroad to near Port Deposit by 1921 and through Port Deposit by 1923. The section of Rock Springs Road between present-day US 1 and Old Conowingo Road/Ragan Road was constructed by the state of Maryland as a macadam road by 1921.
US 222 was first designated 1926, it traveled from Lancaster to Reading.

In 1927, the designation was extended south from Lancaster to Conowingo to replace US 230. A concurrency with PA 41 was also created between Lancaster and Reading and PA 42 through downtown Reading.

The portion of US 222 between Old Conowingo Road/Ragan Road and the Pennsylvania border was built by the state as a concrete road in 1928. In addition, the concurrent PA 41 designation between Lancaster and Reading was replaced with PA 240, and a PA 73 concurrency was created with US 222/PA 240 between New Holland Avenue, where it split south, and downtown Reading.

The road was extended south to US 1 in Conowingo from 1929 to 1930. The PA 240 designation was also removed, and road realigned though and near Reading.
By 1930, the portion of US 22 in Lebanon became problematic for motorists along the current US 422; Reading via US 22 and US 222; and Allentown on Hamilton Street (US 22). PA 43 had been aligned as a bypass between Allentown and Harrisburg. On June 8, 1931, the American Association of State Highway Officials came to a resolution to the traffic problem, by replacing the PA 43 corridor with US 22 and the William Penn Highway name to match. The state truncated PA 43 to Susquehanna Street from Allentown to Bethlehem. US 222 replaced the former US 22 alignment from Reading to Allentown. Hamilton Street was numbered as US 222, west of Center City Allentown, where it turned north onto 15th Street. This portion of US 222 was seven blocks long, ending at Tilghman Street, which was then US Route 22. Signs were changed to reflect the new designations on May 31, 1932, with the new route designations officially in place on June 1, 1932.

The portion from Port Deposit to US 1 at Conowingo Dam was paved in 1933; the construction work included rebuilding a railroad bridge across Octoraro Creek into a highway bridge.

The bridge over the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was constructed in 1934, replacing an at-grade crossing. The old highway approaching the Aikin grade crossing became MD 449.

In 1936, US 222 was extended north to Brownstown.

The MD 268 concurrency was removed from the portion between US 1 at Conowingo to US 40 (now MD 7) in Perryville in 1937.

In 1938, the route was widened to four lanes from Maiden Creek to Trexlertown as well as from Wescoesville to Allentown.

In 1940, a widening to four lanes took place from Lancaster to PA 501, in Adamstown, and Reading to North Temple Boulevard. Additionally, the road was shifted to follow 5th Street north through Reading and the 5th Street Highway through Muhlenberg Township, US 122 and PA 722 replaced the PA 42 concurrency south of Reading and the US 120 concurrency north of it, and new concurrences with PA 324, PA 324, and PA 501 was created.

In 1941, the road was widened from Shillington to Reading.

In 1942, the road was rebuilt in Maryland.

The road was proposed to be widened to from US 40 to US 1 as early as 1934. However this construction did not occur untill 1944. The work was done in order to improve access to United States Naval Training Center Bainbridge.

In 1945, a realignment in Ephrata opened. The new alignment included a new cloverleaf interchange with US 322.

A widening project took place from North Temple Boulevard to Maiden Creek, as well as from Trexlertown to Wescoesville. Both of these were competed in 1946.

In 1950, an intersection with the Pennsylvania Turnpike opened and part of the road was mildly realigned. 

In 1953, a cloverleaf interchange was built with the freeway bypass of US 230.

With the construction of the Lehigh Valley Thruway in 1954 and the relocation of US 22 to that route, US 222 was extended. The route was also widened between Gouglersville and Shillington. 

Work on a project to truncate US 222 was competed by 1956. From the south, US 222 left Hamilton Boulevard and turned north onto the freeway. US 222 terminated at an interchange with US 22, US 309, and PA 29 in South Whitehall Township.

In 1958, the road was signed on the original route and northbound on Conestoga Street and Queen Street and a median was installed from Reading to Elizabeth Avenue. Additionally, the Susquehanna River Road section was transferred from state to county maintenance through a road transfer agreement.

In 1949, plans were made to build a four-lane bridge across Tulpehocken Creek at Warren Street. As part of this plan, Warren Street was to be widened from the proposed bridge to Schuylkill Avenue. This widened Warren Street was envisioned to become part of a bypass route of Reading for US 222. The bridge and widening were approved with the provision that Warren Street only be widened as far as Schuylkill Avenue as not to build a bypass route through a residential area. Construction on the bridge and the Warren Street Bypass between US 422 (Harrisburg Pike, now Penn Avenue) and PA 83 (now PA 183, Schuylkill Avenue) began in 1950. In 1953, the Park Avenue Extension (which extended Park Avenue in Wyomissing to the bypass) and the Warren Street Bypass from US 422 in Wyomissing to Tulpehocken Creek, along with the Tulpehocken Creek bridge, was finished, with a continuation of the Warren Street Bypass northeast from PA 83 to US 222 (Allentown Pike, now 5th Street Highway) proposed. Construction on the rest of the Warren Street Bypass began in 1956 with the process of widening of the existing Warren Street. The PA 83 bridge over the bypass was built in 1957. In 1959, the Warren Street Bypass extension to US 222 was opened to traffic with the portion of Warren Street between Tulpehocken Creek and PA 83 widened to four lanes. The Warren Street Bypass included an interchange with the under-construction Reading Bypass (now US 422, West Shore Bypass) southwest of Tulpehocken Creek when it opened.

In 1960, the concurrency with PA 501 was eliminated.

In 1961, a median was installed in Ephrata. Northbound traffic also shifted to Laurel Street and Fifth Street in Reading, while The original routing became southbound only, the Susquehanna River Road portion was also restored to state level maintenance.

In 1962, the US 122 concurrency was removed from US 222 in Reading as part of the elimination of US 122. In addition, the southbound road was relocated onto McGovern Avenue and in Reading northbound traffic was moved again to follow Bingaman Street and Fifth Street while southbound was realigned off Fifth Street to follow Chestnut Street and Fourth Street. 

The road in Maryland was widened between what is now the MD 222–MD 275—MD 824 intersection and Port Deposit from 1959 to 1962. The road also mildy realigned when a new diamond interchange with I-95 was built the following year. The old alignment of US 222 east of its I-95 interchange became Maryland Route 824.

The bypass of Allentown, originally concurrent with PA 29, had this designation removed in 1966. Additionally, the PA 73 concurrency were removed from the portion in Lancaster.

In 1968, the road was truncated to end at the cloverleaf Interchange with PA 309.

The highway was resurfaced with bituminous concrete from MD 7 to US 40 and reconstructed with wider lanes from US 40 to the southern MD 824 intersection in 1969. The work included rebuilding the bridge across the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.

In 1970, the road was widened to four lanes and a median barrier installed from PA 741 to Locust Lane.

In 1972, the southern terminus was truncated to US 40 in Perryville, with MD 222 replacing the route along Aiken Avenue between MD 7 and US 40.

In 1970, construction began on a freeway bypass around Kutztown. The new alignment was opened to traffic on May 25, 1973, with a ribbon-cutting ceremony held.

In 1973, construction began on a project to widen the Warren Street Bypass to six lanes. This included replacement of overpasses and underpasses. Work on the project was completed in 1976.
Studies for a limited-access highway connecting Lancaster and Reading began in the early 1950s. In 1962, construction began on a four-lane highway between Spring Township and Bern Township that would eventually connect to US 222. After construction stopped, this stretch became known as &quot;The Road to Nowhere.&quot; In 1973, the federal government approved the relocation of homes and businesses along the path of the proposed US 222 freeway between Lancaster and Reading. On November 15, 1975, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) approved for this. In July 1977, the final section of the US 222 freeway between Lancaster and the Berks County border opened to traffic. PA 272 was given a concurrency with the road.

In 1984, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) announced plans to extend the road to PA 145 in Allentown. Traffic engineer Samuel D. Darrohh said that Allentown is one of few Pennsylvania cities without a traffic route going through it. After the plan was introduced, he said that motorists might be aided if US 222 were extended along Hamilton Boulevard to connect with the proposed PA 145 corridor. PennDOT originally planned the road as US 222 but AASHTO denied the extension, stating that the route &quot;is not the shortest or best available route between major control points on the system, and therefore, does not adhere to the policies established under AASHTO&#x27;s &#x27;Purpose and Policy Statement for U.S. Numbered Highways&#x27;&quot;. In addition, the route did not meet the criteria for a business route.

The bridge over the Baltimore and Ohio railroad was reconstructed from 1987 to 1989.

In 1980, I-78 became part of the freeway that occupied PA 309. With this, the interchange with I-78 and PA 309 was rebuilt from a cloverleaf interchange into a partial cloverleaf interchange and partial diamond interchange from 1989 to 1990.

The I-95 interchange was rebuilt from a diamond interchange to a four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange in 1994.

AASHTO approved truncating the southern terminus from US 40 in Perryville to US 1 in Conowingo at their April 1995 spring meeting. The Maryland State Highway Administration proposed and AASHTO approved the redesignation of US 222 to MD 222 from US 40 in Perryville to US 1 in Conowingo in February 1996; however, this had already been enacted officially and marked publicly in 1995.

In 1995, construction began on the Park Road Corridor to connect US 222/US 422 at the junction of the West Shore Bypass and Warren Street Bypass to the Road to Nowhere. Construction of the Park Road Corridor was completed in October 1998. As a result, US 222 was shifted to follow the Park Road Corridor and the Road to Nowhere to bypass the Reading area, replacing SR 3055 along the Road to Nowhere. The former alignment of US 222 that was bypassed became PA 12 along the Warren Street Bypass between US 222/US 422 and US 222 Bus. and a northern extension of US 222 Bus. along 5th Street Highway and Allentown Pike through Muhlenberg Township.

From 1997 to 2004, reconstruction of the US 30 interchange onto and from the at-grade section in Lancaster from a cloverleaf interchange into a collector distributor roadway was undertaken. The road subsequently rerouted onto the newly created Chester Road and York Road. 

On January 29, 2005, the service road at the PA 272 and the Pennsylvania Turnpike interchange was officially named Colonel Howard Boulevard.

In 1998, construction began on a US 222 freeway bypass of Reading. The first portion opened between PA 724 and US 422 in 2000. In 2004, construction was completed on the section of the US 222 freeway between Grings Hill Road and PA 724. As a result, US 222 was shifted to follow the new freeway between Grings Hill Road and US 422 and run concurrent with US 422 on the Warren Street Bypass north to the interchange with the West Shore Bypass and PA 12. The former alignment of US 222 along Lancaster Avenue became a southern extension of US 222 Bus. In June 2006, the US 222 freeway was completed between the Lancaster County border and Grings Hill Road. This completed the project.
In 2002, construction began on a bypass route for US 222 and PA 100 around Trexlertown. On September 29, 2005, PA 100 was rerouted to bypass Trexlertown to the west along the four-lane divided Trexlertown Bypass. US 222 was moved onto the bypass on September 28, 2007, following the completion of the bypass. The construction cost $144 million. The former alignment of US 222 through Trexlertown along Hamilton Boulevard was designated SR 6222. The new road was officially named the Fred Jaindl Memorial Highway, in honor of Fred Jaindl.

In 2008, construction was competed on a new northbound ramp connecting to Paper Mill Road, replacing the ramp onto Spring Ridge Drive.

In 2011, an new northbound ramp was opened connecting to Park Drive at the Interchange with Business Route 222 in Reading.

On July 5, 2012, a portion of the southbound roadbed near the Berks County line had to close due to an 8-inch buckle in the road surface caused by the hot weather. Repairs were completed the next day.

The PA 183 and PA 51 interchanges were both reconstructed starting in 2010. This project saw ramps and the overpass rebuilt, and left turn ramps reach ed by right turn ramps and existing ramps midyied to remove said connections. New previously nonexistent connections were also added. Initially set for completion in August 2012, it was not completed until early 2013.

In March 2013, construction began on a new bridge to carry the road over the Amtrak tracks in Lancaster. The bridge project cost $26.6 million, with $12.7 million of that figure the actual construction costs of the bridge. The new bridge, which is four lanes wide and connects Lititz Pike directly with North Duke Street, opened to traffic on July 9, 2014, with the old bridge demolished. The bridge was named the Thaddeus Stevens Bridge in honor of Thaddeus Stevens, a 19th-century abolitionist and United States Representative who was from Lancaster. Concurrent with the construction of the new bridge, McGovern Avenue was converted to a two-way road between North Queen Street and North Duke Street to provide improved access to Lancaster station.

A roundabout was planned to replace the intersection with PA 662 in Richmond Township in order to reduce traffic congestion. The project, which cost $6.6 million, replaced the signalized intersection between the two routes with a roundabout, with US 222 widened to four lanes at the roundabout. Construction of the roundabout began on September 6, 2016. The roundabout opened a few lanes to traffic on May 22, 2018, with the rest opened on July 20.

In 2010, officials in Berks County pushed for PennDOT to widen a portion of the two-lane road to four lanes due to traffic and safety issues. In June 2018, plans to widen a portion of US 222 in Maidencreek Township near the PA 73 intersection to five lanes with a center left-turn lane received approval from township supervisors. The widening project was completed in 2020.

In 2019, construction began to convert the interchange with US 322 near Ephrata into a diverging diamond. The work, which cost $10.9 million and received federal funding, opened on May 17, 2021, one year ahead of schedule. No overpasses needed to be replaced.

On September 9, 2019, construction began on a $26 million project to widen the road at the PA 73 intersection along with adding roundabouts at Genesis Drive and Schaeffer Road. The roundabout at Schaeffer Road opened in December 2021. The construction project widening US 222 in Maidencreek Township and adding two roundabouts was completed in June 2022.

Work began in April 2022 to reconstruct the road between Reading Boulevard and Paper Mill Road. It was completed that November.

A portion of the road in Lancaster county was renamed in September 2024 as the Senator Noah W. Wenger Memorial Highway.

The US 30 interchange is being reconstructed as part of a project. This will include widening the stretch north to six lanes, as well as lowering the roadbed near bridges and replacing some of them to increase clearances. It is expected to be completed on September 3, 2027.

In 2021, preliminary design began on a project to widen US 222 between Maidencreek Township and the southern end of the Kutztown Bypass to a four-lane road with a median barrier preventing left turns and cross traffic. Along this stretch, roundabouts will be constructed at Pleasant Hill Road and Richmond Road. Construction contracts are planned to be awarded in 2024 with completion expected in 2026. In 2022, construction will begin on a roundabout at Long Lane in Maxatawny Township. Preliminary engineering to widen US 222 between the northern end of the Kutztown Bypass and the Lehigh County line is not expected to take place until the late 2020s.

There are plans to construct a roundabout at the intersection with Schantz Road in Upper Macungie Township.

==Major intersections==


















==Special routes==

===Former Maryland truck route===
U.S. Route 222 Truck was a truck bypass of US 222 from US 222 in Perryville to US 1 and US 222 in Conowingo. The signed route followed MD 275 from US 222 in Perryville north to MD 276 in Woodlawn. US 222 Truck continued north on MD 276 from Woodlawn north to US 1 west of Rising Sun. The truck route then headed west on US 1 to US 222 in Conowingo. US 222 Truck was downgraded to MD 222 Truck when US 222 became MD 222 between Perryville and Conowingo.
===Reading business loop===
U.S. Route 222 Business (US 222 Bus.) is a business route of US 222 located in Reading, Pennsylvania. The southern terminus is at US 222 in Cumru Township. Its northern terminus is at US 222 in Ontelaunee Township. The route begins at the US 222 freeway and heads through the southwestern suburbs of Reading as Lancaster Avenue, intersecting PA 724 in Shillington. US 222 Bus. continues into Reading on Lancaster Avenue and intersects the northern termini of PA 625 and PA 10 before reaching an interchange with the US 422 freeway. The business route crosses the Schuylkill River and becomes Bingaman Street. US 222 Bus. turns north on 5th Street and intersects US 422 Bus. in downtown Reading and the southern terminus of PA 61 to the north of downtown. The route interchanges with the PA 12 freeway and continues north through suburban Muhlenberg Township as 5th Street Highway. US 222 Bus. reaches Temple and continues northeast to its northern terminus as Allentown Pike. US 222 Bus. is the only auxiliary route of US 222 in Pennsylvania.

With the creation of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, the road between Reading and Lancaster was designated US 222 while the road between Reading and Allentown was part of US 22, which ran along what was designated the William Penn Highway in 1916 and PA 3 in 1924. In the late 1920s, US 222 briefly ran concurrent with PA 41 and PA 240 at different times. PA 42 originally ran north–south through Reading starting in 1927. By 1930, the concurrent state route designations were removed from US 222 and US 22. US 222 entered Reading along with PA 73 along Lancaster Avenue and Bingaman Street before turning north on 9th Street along with PA 83 to end at US 22 and US 422 at Penn Street. US 22 continued north on 9th Street out of Reading and continued along Kutztown Road through Temple toward Allentown. US 120 began at US 222 at Bingaman Street and headed north on 4th Street and Center Street out of Reading. In 1931, US 22 was moved to a more direct alignment between Harrisburg and Allentown, and US 222 was extended north along the former alignment between Reading and Allentown. US 222 was shifted to use Lancaster Avenue, Bingaman Street, and 5th Street and 5th Street Highway through the Reading area in the 1930s, running concurrent with US 122 through downtown Reading. The US 122 and PA 73 concurrencies were removed by 1966. In 1975, US 222 was rerouted to bypass Reading on the West Shore Bypass and the Warren Street Bypass, with the former alignment through the city becoming US 222 Bus. In 1998, US 222 Bus. was extended north to its current terminus following the rerouting of US 222 to a new outer bypass of Reading. The business route was extended south to its current endpoint in 2004 with the completion of the US 222 freeway south of Reading to Mohnton.

<text>U.S. Route 322 (US 322) is a , east–west United States Highway, traversing Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. The road is a spur of US 22 and one of the original highways from 1926. A portion of it at one time was concurrent with the Lakes-to-Sea Highway.

===Ohio===
US 322 begins at the intersection of Superior Avenue and East Roadway at Public Square in Downtown Cleveland, just northeast of the junction of U.S. Routes US 6, US 42, and State Route 3 (Superior Avenue) with US 422 and State Route 8, State Route 14, State Route 43, and State Route 87 (Ontario Street). East of Public Square, the route runs eastward through midtown Cleveland conjoined with US 6 along Superior Avenue. Northwest of Cleveland State University, US 322 turns south onto 13th Street and runs eastward (as Chester Avenue) through Playhouse Square. Exiting the commercial district, US 322 interchanges Interstate 90, at exit 173. In University Circle, US 322 is briefly concurrent with U.S. Route 20 (Euclid Avenue), running through the campus of Case Western Reserve University. The overlap terminates at the eastern edge of University Circle, where US 322 splits off to the south by southwest, becoming Mayfield Road as it enters Little Italy, and through the eastern suburbs of Cleveland Heights, South Euclid, Lyndhurst, Mayfield Heights, and Gates Mills, continuing on as Mayfield until the Geauga County/Ashtabula County line.

In Geauga County, US 322 passes through suburban Chester Township and into Ohio&#x27;s second largest Amish community, which includes the rural townships of Claridon, Huntsburg, Windsor Township and the west side of Orwell Township. In Ashtabula County, US 322 crosses through Windsor Township, Orwell Township, the village of Orwell, Colebrook Township, Wayne Township and Williamsfield Township before crossing the Ohio-Pennsylvania state line south of Pymatuning Reservoir.

===Pennsylvania===

US 322 enters Pennsylvania from Ohio in West Shenango Township. From this point, the road continues east, forming a concurrency with U.S. Route 6 between Conneaut Lake and Meadville, interchanging with Interstate 79 and intersecting U.S. Route 19 in Meadville. In Franklin, the route crosses U.S. Route 62. Continuing east, US 322 interchanges with Interstate 80 near Clarion before meeting U.S. Route 119 and U.S. Route 219 south of DuBois. US 322 heads southeast as a surface road before merging onto the Interstate 99/U.S. Route 220 freeway in Port Matilda, following that east to State College. The US 322 freeway continues past I-99 before ending to the east of State College. Near Potters Mills, US 322 becomes a freeway again and intersects U.S. Route 22 and U.S. Route 522 in Lewistown, forming a long concurrency with the former.

The US 22/US 322 freeway continues across the Appalachian Mountains, meeting U.S. Route 11/U.S. Route 15 prior to crossing the Susquehanna River by way of the Clarks Ferry Bridge. The road continues south along the east bank of the river to Harrisburg, where US 322 splits from US 22 by heading east onto Interstate 81 and then south onto Interstate 83. At the interchange between I-83 and the northern terminus of Interstate 283, US 322 turns east and heads to Hershey, intersecting U.S. Route 422. From this point, US 322 heads southeast through the Pennsylvania Dutch Country, intersecting U.S. Route 222 at a diverging diamond interchange near Ephrata. In Downingtown, the route crosses U.S. Route 30 before heading to West Chester. Here, US 322 bypasses the town and merges onto a freeway alignment along with U.S. Route 202 that ends to the south of West Chester. US 322 follows US 202 until Painters Crossing, where it turns east onto U.S. Route 1. In Concordville, US 322 splits from US 1 and heads southeast to Chester. In Chester, the route forms a brief concurrency with Interstate 95 before heading southeast and interchanging with U.S. Route 13 prior to the Commodore Barry Bridge over the Delaware River.

===New Jersey===
US 322 enters New Jersey via the Commodore Barry Bridge just north of Delaware and interchanges with Interstate 295 and the New Jersey Turnpike before entering historic Mullica Hill. In Glassboro, it bisects Rowan University. At Williamstown, US 322 goes onto the Black Horse Pike (picking up where Route 42 ends) and follows it the rest of the way to Atlantic City, being concurrent with U.S. Route 40 from Mays Landing on east. In the 1960s and 1970s, the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) had planned for a freeway bypass of U.S. Route 322 around Glassboro. Later it was planned as a New Jersey Turnpike extension, but all plans were dropped due to budget cuts and mounting opposition.

<doc id="902703" wikidata="Q544651" url="?curid=902703" title="William Kirby (entomologist)">
<text>William Kirby (19 September 1759 – 4 July 1850) was an English entomologist, an original member of the Linnean Society and a Fellow of the Royal Society, as well as a country rector, so that he was an eminent example of the &quot;parson-naturalist&quot;. The four-volume &quot;Introduction to Entomology&quot;, co-written with William Spence, was widely influential.

== Family origins and early studies ==

Kirby was a grandson of the Suffolk topographer John Kirby (author of &quot;The Suffolk Traveller&quot;) and nephew of artist-topographer Joshua Kirby (a friend of Thomas Gainsborough&#x27;s). He was also a cousin of the children&#x27;s author Sarah Trimmer. His parents were William Kirby, a solicitor, and Lucy Meadows. He was born on 19 September 1759 at Witnesham, Suffolk, and studied at Ipswich School and Caius College, Cambridge, where he graduated in 1781. Taking holy orders in 1782, he spent his entire working life in the peaceful seclusion of an English country parsonage at Barham in Suffolk, working at the parish church of St Mary&#x27;s for 68 years, first as curate, then as rector from 1797. He assisted in the publication of pamphlets against Thomas Paine during the 1790s.

Kirby was brought to the study of natural history by Nicholas Gwynn (a friend of Boerhaave&#x27;s), who introduced him to Sir James Edward Smith in 1791. Soon afterwards, he corresponded with Smith, seeking advice on the foundation of a natural history museum at Ipswich. Among his early friends were the naturalists Charles Sutton and Thomas Marsham, with whom he made lengthy scientific excursions, as later with William Jackson Hooker and others, becoming a leading parson-naturalist. His name appears on the original list of Fellows of the Linnean Society. He delivered the first of his many papers on 7 May 1793, on &quot;Three New Species of Hirudo&quot; (&quot;Linn. Trans.&quot; II, 316).

== Major publications ==
Kirby produced his first major work, the &quot;Monographia Apum Angliae&quot; (Monograph on the Bees of England), in 1802. His purpose was both scientific and religious:

&#x27;The author of Scripture is also the author of Nature: and this visible world, by types indeed, and by symbols, declares the same truths as the Bible does by words. To make the naturalist a religious man – to turn his attention to the glory of God, that he may declare his works, and in the study of his creatures may see the loving-kindness of the Lord – may this in some measure be the fruit of my work…&#x27; (Correspondence, 1800)

This, the first scientific treatise on English bees, brought him to the notice of leading entomologists in Britain and abroad. Extensive correspondence followed with scientists including Alexander Macleay, Walkenaer, Johan Christian Fabricius and Adam Afzelius. 153 of the bee species, including &quot;Lasioglossum malachurum&quot;, came from Kirby&#x27;s own parish.

Kirby began planning his &quot;Introduction to Entomology&quot;, a celebrated title, in 1808. This was the practical result of a friendship formed in 1805 with William Spence and appeared in four volumes between 1815 and 1826. Much of the work fell to Kirby owing to Spence&#x27;s ill health. The book was illustrated by John Curtis. It reached its seventh edition in 1856. In 1830 he was invited to write one of the &quot;Bridgewater Treatises&quot;, his subject being &quot;The History, Habits, and Instincts of Animals&quot; (2 vols., 1835).

With Edward Sabine and J.E. Gray, Kirby prepared the natural history supplement for Captain William Parry&#x27;s 1819–1820 polar expedition to seek the North-West Passage: his work formed the insect section of the &quot;Account of the Animals seen by the late Northern Expedition while within the Arctic Circle&quot; 1821. His friend W.J. Hooker established his contact with John Richardson to involve him in the publication of findings from Sir John Franklin&#x27;s 1st and 2nd expeditions, the insect section in the &quot;Fauna Boreali-Americana&quot; in 1837.

== Institution-founding activities ==
In 1815, Kirby took his MA with the intention of applying for the Professorship of Botany at the University of Cambridge when it should become vacant. A dispute arose as to whether this appointment lay in the grant of the Senate or the Crown. Kirby&#x27;s Tory political complexion proved a stumbling-block, and in the event John Stevens Henslow was appointed.

In 1827, Kirby assisted Henry Denny in arranging the natural history specimens at Norwich Museum. In 1832, he helped to establish an early museum in Ipswich under the aegis of the town&#x27;s Literary Institute, and presented a herbarium and a group of fossils. With Spence, he helped to found the Entomological Society of London in 1833, with John Westwood as Secretary, and became its Honorary President for life. On that occasion, he presented his own cabinet of insects, collected over more than 40 years, which contained many of the specimens figured in his papers.

Kirby was the original President of the Ipswich Museum, 1847–50, fulfilling a project which he had advocated since 1791, and appeared with William Buckland and others at the opening ceremony. The lithograph by T.H. Maguire was copied from the oil portrait by Friedrich Henry Bischoff commissioned for and still displayed in the Museum. Professor Henslow succeeded him in this office.

==Works==
Besides the books already mentioned he was the author of many papers in the Transactions of the Linnean Society, the Zoological Journal and other periodicals; &quot;Strictures on Sir James Smith&#x27;s Hypothesis respecting the Lilies of the Field of our Saviour and the Acanthus of Virgil&quot; (1819) and &quot;Seven Sermons on our Lords Temptations&quot; (1829).
