<text>The Metamorphoses (, from : &quot;Transformations&quot;) is a Latin narrative poem from 8 CE by the Roman poet Ovid. It is considered his &quot;magnum opus&quot;. The poem chronicles the history of the world from its creation to the deification of Julius Caesar in a mythico-historical framework comprising over 250 myths, 15 books, and 11,995 lines.

Although it meets some of the criteria for an epic, the poem defies simple genre classification because of its varying themes and tones. Ovid took inspiration from the genre of metamorphosis poetry. Although some of the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; derives from earlier treatment of the same myths, Ovid diverged significantly from all of his models.

The &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; is one of the most influential works in Western culture. It has inspired such authors as Dante Alighieri, Giovanni Boccaccio, Geoffrey Chaucer, and William Shakespeare. Numerous episodes from the poem have been depicted in works of sculpture, painting, and music, especially during the Renaissance. There was a resurgence of attention to Ovid&#x27;s work near the end of the 20th century. The &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; continues to inspire and be retold through various media. Numerous English translations of the work have been made, the first by William Caxton in 1480.

==Sources and models==
Ovid&#x27;s decision to make myth the primary subject of the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; was influenced by Alexandrian poetry. In that tradition myth functioned as a vehicle for moral reflection or insight, yet Ovid approached it as an &quot;object of play and artful manipulation&quot;. The model for a collection of metamorphosis myths was found in the metamorphosis poetry of the Hellenistic tradition, which is first represented by Boios&#x27; &quot;Ornithogonia&quot;—a now-fragmentary poem of collected myths about the metamorphoses of humans into birds.

There are three examples of &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; by later Hellenistic writers, but little is known of their contents. The &quot;Heteroioumena&quot; by Nicander of Colophon is better known, and clearly an influence on the poem: 21 of the stories from this work are treated in the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. However, in a way that was typical for writers of the period, Ovid diverged significantly from his models. The &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; was longer than any previous collection of metamorphosis myths (Nicander&#x27;s work consisted of probably four or five books) and positioned itself within a historical framework.

Some of the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; derives from earlier literary and poetic treatment of the same myths. This material was of varying quality and comprehensiveness; while some of it was &quot;finely worked&quot;, in other cases Ovid may have been working from limited material. In the case of an oft-used myth such as that of Io in Book I, which was the subject of literary adaptation as early as the 5th century BCE, and as recently as a generation prior to his own, Ovid reorganises and innovates existing material in order to foreground his favoured topics and to embody the key themes of the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;.

==Contents==
Scholars have found it difficult to place the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; in a genre. The poem has been considered as an epic or a type of epic (for example, an anti-epic or mock-epic); a that pulls together a series of examples in miniature form, such as the epyllion; a sampling of one genre after another; or simply a narrative that refuses categorization.

The poem is generally considered to meet the criteria for an epic; it is considerably long, relating over 250 narratives across fifteen books; it is composed in dactylic hexameter, the meter of both the ancient &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;, and the more contemporary epic &quot;Aeneid&quot;; and it treats the high literary subject of myth. However, the poem &quot;handles the themes and employs the tone of virtually every species of literature&quot;, ranging from epic and elegy to tragedy and pastoral. Commenting on the genre debate, Karl Galinsky has opined that &quot;... it would be misguided to pin the label of any genre on the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;&quot;.

The &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; is comprehensive in its chronology, recounting the creation of the world to the death of Julius Caesar, which had occurred only a year before Ovid&#x27;s birth; it has been compared to works of universal history, which became important in the 1st century BCE. In spite of its apparently unbroken chronology, scholar Brooks Otis has identified four divisions in the narrative:
* Book I – Book II (end, line 875): The Divine Comedy
* Book III – Book VI, 400: The Avenging Gods
* Book VI, 401 – Book XI (end, line 795): The Pathos of Love
* Book XII – Book XV (end, line 879): Rome and the Deified Ruler

Ovid works his way through his subject matter, often in an apparently arbitrary fashion, by jumping from one transformation tale to another, sometimes retelling what had come to be seen as central events in the world of Greek mythology and sometimes straying in odd directions. It begins with the ritual &quot;invocation of the muse&quot;, and makes use of traditional epithets and circumlocutions. But instead of following and extolling the deeds of a human hero, it leaps from story to story with little connection.

The recurring theme, as with nearly all of Ovid&#x27;s work, is love—be it personal love or love personified in the figure of &quot;Amor&quot; (Cupid). Indeed, the other Roman gods are repeatedly perplexed, humiliated, and made ridiculous by Amor, an otherwise relatively minor god of the pantheon, who is the closest thing this putative mock-epic has to a hero. Apollo comes in for particular ridicule as Ovid shows how irrational love can confound the god out of reason. The work as a whole inverts the accepted order, elevating humans and human passions while making the gods and their desires and conquests objects of low humor.

The &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; ends with an epilogue (Book XV.871–879), one of only two surviving Latin epics to do so (the other being Statius&#x27; &quot;Thebaid&quot;). The ending acts as a declaration that everything except his poetry—even Rome—must give way to change:

==Themes==
The different genres and divisions in the narrative allow the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; to display a wide range of themes. Scholar Stephen M. Wheeler notes that &quot;metamorphosis, mutability, love, violence, artistry, and power are just some of the unifying themes that critics have proposed over the years&quot;.

===Metamorphosis===

Metamorphosis or transformation is a unifying theme amongst the episodes of the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. Ovid raises its significance explicitly in the opening lines of the poem: &quot;In nova fert animus mutatas dicere formas / corpora;&quot; (&quot;I intend to speak of forms changed into new entities;&quot;). Accompanying this theme is often violence, inflicted upon a victim whose transformation becomes part of the natural landscape. This theme amalgamates the much-explored opposition between the hunter and the hunted and the thematic tension between art and nature.

There is a great variety among the types of transformations that take place: from human to inanimate objects (Nileus), constellations (Ariadne&#x27;s Crown), animals (Perdix), and plants (Daphne, Baucis and Philemon); from animals (ants) and fungi (mushrooms) to human; from one sex to another (hyenas); and from one colour to another (pebbles). The metamorphoses themselves are often located metatextually within the poem, through grammatical or narratorial transformations. At other times, transformations are developed into humour or absurdity, such that, slowly, &quot;the reader realizes he is being had&quot;, or the very nature of transformation is questioned or subverted. This phenomenon is merely one aspect of Ovid&#x27;s extensive use of illusion and disguise.

==Influence==


The &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; has exerted a considerable influence on literature and the arts, particularly of the West; scholar A. D. Melville says that &quot;It may be doubted whether any poem has had so great an influence on the literature and art of Western civilization as the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;.&quot; Although a majority of its stories do not originate with Ovid himself, but with such writers as Hesiod and Homer, for others the poem is their sole source.

The influence of the poem on the works of Geoffrey Chaucer is extensive. In &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, the story of Coronis and Phoebus Apollo (Book II 531–632) is adapted to form the basis for The Manciple&#x27;s Tale. The story of Midas (Book XI 174–193) is referred to and appears—though much altered—in The Wife of Bath&#x27;s Tale. The story of Ceyx and Alcyone (from Book XI 266-345) is adapted by Chaucer in his poem &quot;The Book of the Duchess&quot;, written to commemorate the death of Blanche, Duchess of Lancaster and wife of John of Gaunt.

The &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; was also a considerable influence on William Shakespeare. His &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; is influenced by the story of Pyramus and Thisbe (&quot;Metamorphoses&quot; Book IV); and, in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, a band of amateur actors performs a play about Pyramus and Thisbe. Shakespeare&#x27;s early erotic poem &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot; expands on the myth in Book X of the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. In &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;, the story of Lavinia&#x27;s rape is drawn from Tereus&#x27; rape of Philomela, and the text of the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; is used within the play to enable Titus to interpret his daughter&#x27;s story. Most of Prospero&#x27;s renunciative speech in Act V of &quot;The Tempest&quot; is taken word-for-word from a speech by Medea in Book VII of the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. Among other English writers for whom the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; was an inspiration are John Milton—who made use of it in &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, considered his &quot;magnum opus&quot;, and evidently knew it well—and Edmund Spenser. In Italy, the poem was an influence on Giovanni Boccaccio (the story of Pyramus and Thisbe appears in his poem &quot;L&#x27;Amorosa Fiammetta&quot;) and Dante.
During the Renaissance and Baroque periods, mythological subjects were frequently depicted in art. The &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; was the greatest source of these narratives, such that the term &quot;Ovidian&quot; in this context is synonymous for mythological, in spite of some frequently represented myths not being found in the work. Many of the stories from the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; have been the subject of paintings and sculptures, particularly during this period. Some of the most well-known paintings by Titian depict scenes from the poem, including &quot;Diana and Callisto&quot;, &quot;Diana and Actaeon&quot;, and &quot;Death of Actaeon&quot;. These works form part of Titian&#x27;s &quot;poesie&quot;, a collection of seven paintings derived in part from the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, inspired by ancient Greek and Roman mythologies, which were reunited in the Titian exhibition at The National Gallery in 2020. Other famous works inspired by the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; include Pieter Brueghel&#x27;s painting &quot;Landscape with the Fall of Icarus&quot; and Gian Lorenzo Bernini&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Apollo and Daphne&quot;. The &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; also permeated the theory of art during the Renaissance and the Baroque style, with its idea of transformation and the relation of the myths of Pygmalion and Narcissus to the role of the artist.

Though Ovid was popular for many centuries, interest in his work began to wane after the Renaissance, and his influence on 19th-century writers was minimal. Towards the end of the 20th century his work began to be appreciated once more. Ted Hughes collected together and retold twenty-four passages from the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; in his &quot;Tales from Ovid&quot;, published in 1997. In 1998, Mary Zimmerman&#x27;s stage adaptation &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; premiered at the Lookingglass Theatre, and the following year there was an adaptation of &quot;Tales from Ovid&quot; by the Royal Shakespeare Company. In the early 21st century, the poem continues to inspire and be retold through books, films and plays. A series of works inspired by Ovid&#x27;s book through the tragedy of Diana and Actaeon have been produced by French-based collective LFKs and his film/theatre director, writer and visual artist Jean-Michel Bruyere, including the interactive 360° audiovisual installation &quot;Si poteris narrare, licet&quot; (&quot;if you are able to speak of it, then you may do so&quot;) in 2002, 600 shorts and &quot;medium&quot; film from which 22,000 sequences have been used in the 3D 360° audiovisual installation &quot;La Dispersion du Fils&quot; from 2008 to 2016 as well as an outdoor performance, &quot;Une Brutalité pastorale&quot; (2000).

==Manuscript tradition==
In spite of the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;″ enduring popularity from its first publication (around the time of Ovid&#x27;s exile in 8 AD) no manuscript survives from antiquity. From the 9th and 10th centuries there are only fragments of the poem; it is only from the 11th century onwards that complete manuscripts, of varying value, have been passed down.

The poem retained its popularity throughout late antiquity and the Middle Ages, and is represented by an extremely high number of surviving manuscripts (more than 400); the earliest of these are three fragmentary copies containing portions of Books 1–3, dating to the 9th century.

But the poem&#x27;s immense popularity in antiquity and the Middle Ages belies the struggle for survival it faced in late antiquity. The &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; was preserved through the Roman period of Christianization. Though the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; did not suffer the ignominious fate of the &quot;Medea&quot;, no ancient scholia on the poem survive (although they did exist in antiquity), and the earliest complete manuscript is very late, dating from the 11th century.

Influential in the course of the poem&#x27;s manuscript tradition is the 17th-century Dutch scholar Nikolaes Heinsius. During the years 1640–52, Heinsius collated more than a hundred manuscripts and was informed of many others through correspondence.

Collaborative editorial effort has been investigating the various manuscripts of the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, some forty-five complete texts or substantial fragments, all deriving from a Gallic archetype. The result of several centuries of critical reading is that the poet&#x27;s meaning is firmly established on the basis of the manuscript tradition or restored by conjecture where the tradition is deficient. There are two modern critical editions: William S. Anderson&#x27;s, first published in 1977 in the Teubner series, and R. J. Tarrant&#x27;s, published in 2004 by the Oxford Clarendon Press.

==In English translation==

The full appearance of the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; in English translation (sections had appeared in the works of Chaucer and Gower) coincides with the beginning of printing, and traces a path through the history of publishing. William Caxton produced the first translation of the text on 22 April 1480; set in prose, it is a literal rendering of a French translation known as the &quot;Ovide Moralisé&quot;.

In 1567, Arthur Golding published a translation of the poem that would become highly influential, the version read by Shakespeare and Spenser. It was written in rhyming couplets of iambic heptameter. The next significant translation was by George Sandys, produced from 1621 to 1626, which set the poem in heroic couplets, a metre that would subsequently become dominant in vernacular English epic and in English translations.

In 1717, a translation appeared from Samuel Garth bringing together work &quot;by the most eminent hands&quot;: primarily John Dryden, but several stories by Joseph Addison, one by Alexander Pope, and contributions from Tate, Gay, Congreve, and Rowe, as well as those of eleven others including Garth himself. Translation of the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; after this period was comparatively limited in its achievement; the Garth volume continued to be printed into the 1800s, and had &quot;no real rivals throughout the nineteenth century&quot;.

Around the later half of the 20th century a greater number of translations appeared as literary translation underwent a revival. This trend has continued into the twenty-first century. In 1994, a collection of translations and responses to the poem, entitled &quot;After Ovid: New Metamorphoses&quot;, was produced by numerous contributors in emulation of the process of the Garth volume.

=== The 1557 edition ===
One of the most famous translations of the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; published in France dates back to 1557. Published under the title &quot;La Métamorphose d&#x27;Ovide figurée&quot; (The Illustrated Metamorphosis of Ovid) by the Maison Tournes (1542–1567) in Lyon, it is the result of a collaboration between the publisher Jean de Tournes and Bernard Salomon, an important 16th-century engraver. The publication is edited octavo format and presents Ovid&#x27;s texts accompanied by 178 engraved illustrations.

In the years 1540–1550, the spread of contemporary translations led to a true race to publish the ancient poet&#x27;s texts among the city of Lyon&#x27;s various publishers. Therefore, Jean de Tournes faced fierce competition, which also published new editions of the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. He published the first two books of Ovid in 1456, a version that was followed by an illustrated reprint in 1549. His main competitor was Guillaume Roville, who published the texts illustrated by Pierre Eskrich in 1550 and again in 1551. In 1553, Roville published the first three books with a translation by Barthélémy Aneau, which followed the translation of the first two books by Clément Marot. However, the 1557 version published by Maison Tournes remains the version that enjoys the greatest fortune, as testified by historiographical mentions.

The 16th-century editions of the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; constitute a radical change in the way myths are perceived. In previous centuries, the verses of the ancient poet had been read above all in function of their moralising impact, whereas from the 16th century onwards their aesthetic and hedonistic quality was exalted. The literary context of the time, marked by the birth of the Pléiade, is indicative of this taste for the beauty of poetry.

&quot;The disappearance of the and the marks the end of a Gothic era in Ovidian publishing, just as the publication in 1557 of the Métamorphose figurée marks the appropriation by the Renaissance of a work that is as much in line with its tastes as the moralizing of the Metamorphoses had been with the aspirations of the 14th and 15th centuries&quot;.

The work was republished in French in 1564 and 1583, although it had already been published in Italian by Gabriel Simeoni in 1559 with some additional engravings.

Some copies from 1557 are today held in public collections, namely the National Library of France, the Municipal Library of Lyon, the Brandeis University Library in Waltham (MA) and the Library of Congress in Washington D.C., USA. A digital copy is available on Gallica. It would also appear that a copy has been auctioned at Sotheby&#x27;s.

==== Illustrations ====
The 1557 edition published by Jean de Tournes features 178 engravings by Bernard Salomon accompanying Ovid&#x27;s text. The format is emblematic of the collaboration between Tournes and Salomon, which has existed since their association in the mid-1540s: the pages are developed centred around a title, an engraving with an octosyllabic stanza and a neat border.

The 178 engravings were not made all at once for the full text, but originate from a reissue of the first two books in 1549. In 1546, Jean de Tournes published a first, non-illustrated version of the first two books of the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, for which Bernard Salomon prepared twenty-two initial engravings. Salomon examined several earlier illustrated editions of the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; before working on his engravings, which nevertheless display a remarkable originality.

In the book &quot;Bernard Salomon. Illustrateur lyonnais&quot;, Peter Sharratt states that the plates in this edition, along with that of the &quot;Bible&quot; illustrated by the painter in 1557, are Salomon&#x27;s works that most emphasise the illustrative process based on &quot;a mixture of memories&quot;. Among the earlier editions consulted by Salomon, one in particular stands out: &quot;Metamorphoseos Vulgare&quot;, published in Venice in 1497. The latter shows similarities in the composition of some episodes, such as the &#x27;Creation of the World&#x27; and &#x27;Apollo and Daphne&#x27;. In drawing his figures, Salomon also used Bellifontaine&#x27;s canon, which testifies to his early years as a painter. Among other works, he created some frescoes in Lyon, for which he drew inspiration from his recent work in Fontainebleau.

Better known in his lifetime for his work as a painter, Salomon&#x27;s work in &quot;La Métamorphose d&#x27;Ovide figurée&quot; nevertheless left a mark on his contemporaries. These illustrations contributed to the celebration of the Ovidian texts in their hedonistic dimension. In this respect, Panofsky speaks of &quot;extraordinarily influential woodcuts&quot; and the American art historian Rensselaer W. Lee describes the work as &quot;a major event in the history of art&quot;.

In the Musée des Beaux-arts et des fabrics in Lyon, it is possible to observe wooden panels reproducing the model of Salomon&#x27;s engravings for Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; of 1557.

<text>In Greek mythology, Thanatos (; , &quot;Thánatos&quot;, pronounced in &quot;Death&quot;, from θνῄσκω &quot;thnēskō&quot; &quot;(I) die, am dying&quot;) was the personification of death. He was a minor figure in Greek mythology, often referred to but rarely appearing in person.

His name is transliterated in Latin as &quot;Thanatus&quot;, but his counterpart in Roman mythology is Mors or Letum.

== In myth and poetry ==
The Greek poet Hesiod established in his &quot;Theogony&quot; that Thánatos has no father, but is the son of Nyx (Night) and brother of Hypnos (Sleep).

Homer earlier described Hypnos and Thanatos as twin brothers in his epic poem, the &quot;Iliad&quot;, where they were charged by Zeus via Apollo with the swift delivery of the slain hero Sarpedon to his homeland of Lycia.

Counted among Thanatos&#x27; siblings were other negative personifications such as Geras (Old Age), Oizys (Suffering), Moros (Doom), Apate (Deception), Momus (Blame), Eris (Strife), and Nemesis (Retribution). Thanatos was loosely associated with the three Moirai (for Hesiod, also daughters of Night), particularly Atropos, who was a goddess of death in her own right. He is also, at times, specified as being exclusive to a peaceful death, while the bloodthirsty Keres embodied violent death. His duties as a Guide of the Dead were sometimes superseded by Hermes Psychopompos.

The god&#x27;s character is established by Hesiod in the following passage of the Theogony:

Thanatos was thus regarded as merciless and indiscriminate, hated by – and hateful towards — mortals and gods alike. But in myths which feature him, Thanatos could occasionally be outwitted, a feat that the sly King Sisyphus of Korinth twice accomplished. When it came time for Sisyphus to die, Zeus ordered Thanatos to chain Sisyphus up in Tartarus. Sisyphus cheated death by tricking Thanatos into his own shackles, thereby preventing the demise of any mortal while Thanatos was so enchained.

Eventually Ares, the bloodthirsty god of war, grew frustrated with the battles he incited, since neither side could suffer any casualties. He released Thanatos and handed his captor over to the god. Sisyphus would evade Death a second time by convincing Persephone to allow him to return to his wife stating that she never gave him a proper funeral. This time, Sisyphus was forcefully dragged back to the Underworld by Hermes, where he was sentenced to an eternity of frustration in Tartarus, rolling a boulder up a hill only to have it roll back down when he got close to the top.

A fragment of Alcaeus, a Greek lyric poet of the 6th century BC, refers to this episode:

As the son of Aeolus (and thus a descendant of the Titan Prometheus), Sisyphus was a more-than-mortal figure: when it came to ordinary humans, Thanatos was usually thought of as inexorable. The sole time he was successfully prevented from claiming a mortal life was by the intervention of the hero Heracles, a son of Zeus. Thanatos had come to take the soul of Alkestis, who had offered her life in exchange for the continued life of her husband, King Admetos of Pherai. Heracles was an honored guest in the House of Admetos at the time and offered to repay the king&#x27;s hospitality by contending with Death itself for Alkestis&#x27; life. When Thanatos ascended from Hades to claim Alkestis, Heracles sprung upon the god and overpowered him, winning the right to have Alkestis remain, while Thanatos fled, cheated of his quarry.

Euripides, in &quot;Alcestis&quot;:

== In art==
An Orphic Hymn that invoked Thanatos, here given in late 18th century translation:
&lt;poem&gt;To Death, Fumigation from Manna.

Hear me, O Death, whose empire unconfin&#x27;d
extends to mortal tribes of ev&#x27;ry kind.
On thee, the portion of our time depends,
whose absence lengthens life, whose presence ends.

Thy sleep perpetual bursts the vivid folds
by which the soul, attracting body holds:
common to all, of ev&#x27;ry sex and age,
for nought escapes thy all-destructive rage.

Not youth itself thy clemency can gain,
vigorous and strong, by thee untimely slain.
In thee the end of nature&#x27;s works is known,
in thee all judgment is absolved alone.
No suppliant arts thy dreadful rage controul,
no vows revoke the purpose of thy soul.
O blessed power, regard my ardent prayer,
and human life to age abundant spare.&lt;/poem&gt;

In later eras, as the transition from life to death in Elysium became a more attractive option, Thanatos came to be seen as a beautiful Ephebe. He became associated more with a gentle passing than a woeful demise. Many Roman sarcophagi depict him as a winged boy, very much akin to Cupid: &quot;Eros with crossed legs and torch reversed became the commonest of all symbols for Death&quot;, observes Arthur Bernard Cook.

Thanatos has also been portrayed as a slumbering infant in the arms of his mother Nyx, or as a youth carrying a butterfly (the ancient Greek word &quot;ψυχή&quot; can mean soul or butterfly, or life, amongst other things) or a wreath of poppies (poppies were associated with Hypnos and Thanatos because of their hypnogogic traits and the eventual death engendered by overexposure to them).

He is often shown carrying an inverted torch (holding it upside down in his hands), representing a life extinguished. He is usually described as winged and with a sword sheathed at his belt. In Euripides&#x27; &quot;Alcestis&quot; (438 BCE), he is depicted dressed in black and carrying a sword. Thanatos was rarely portrayed in art without his twin brother Hypnos.

Thanatos is also famously shown on the Euphronios Krator where he and his brother Hypnos are shown carrying the body of Sarpedon to his home for burial. Here he is pictured as a full-grown and bearded man with wings, as is his brother.

== In psychology and medicine ==

According to Sigmund Freud, humans have a life instinct—which he named &quot;Eros&quot;—and a death drive, which is commonly called (though not by Freud himself) &quot;Thanatos&quot;. This postulated death drive allegedly compels humans to engage in risky and self-destructive acts that could lead to their own death. Behaviors such as thrill-seeking and aggression are viewed as actions which stem from this Thanatos instinct.

However, some scientists argue that there is little evidence that most people have a specific drive toward self-destruction. According to them, the behaviors Freud studied can be explained by simpler, known processes, such as salience biases (e.g., a person abuses drugs because the promise of immediate pleasure is more compelling than the intellectual knowledge of harm sometime in the future) and risk calculations (e.g., a person drives recklessly or plays dangerous sports because the increases in status and reproductive success outweigh the risk of injury or death).

Thanatophobia is the fear of things associated with or reminiscent of death and mortality, such as corpses or graveyards. It is related to necrophobia, although the latter term typically refers to a specific fear of dead bodies rather than a fear of death in general.

Thanatology is the academic and scientific study of death among human beings. It investigates the circumstances surrounding a person&#x27;s death, the grief experienced by the deceased&#x27;s loved ones, and larger social attitudes towards death such as ritual and memorialization. It is primarily an interdisciplinary study, frequently undertaken by professionals in nursing, psychology, sociology, psychiatry, social work and veterinary science. It also describes bodily changes that accompany death and the after-death period.

Thanatophoric dysplasia, so named because of its lethality at birth, is the most common lethal congenital skeletal dysplasia with an estimated prevalence of one in 6,400 to one in 16,700 births. Its name &quot;Thanatophoros&quot;, means &quot;death-bearing&quot; in Greek.

Euthanasia, &quot;good death&quot; in Greek, is the act or practice of ending the life of an individual who would otherwise experience severe, incurable suffering or disability. It typically involves lethal injection or the suspension of extraordinary medical treatment. Doctor Jack Kevorkian named his euthanasia device the Thanatron.

<doc id="83103" wikidata="Q1287983" url="?curid=83103" title="Jimmy Webb">
<text>Jimmy Layne Webb (born August 15, 1946) is an American songwriter, composer, and singer. He achieved success at an early age, winning the Grammy Award for Song of the Year at the age of 21. During his career, he established himself as one of America&#x27;s most successful and honored songwriter/composers. 

Webb has written numerous platinum-selling songs, including &quot;Up, Up and Away&quot;, &quot;By the Time I Get to Phoenix&quot;, &quot;MacArthur Park&quot;, &quot;Wichita Lineman&quot;, &quot;Worst That Could Happen&quot;, &quot;Galveston&quot; and &quot;All I Know&quot;. He had successful collaborations with Glen Campbell, Michael Feinstein, Linda Ronstadt, the 5th Dimension, the Supremes, Art Garfunkel and Richard Harris.

Webb was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1986 and the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1990. He received the National Academy of Songwriters Lifetime Achievement Award in 1993, the Songwriters Hall of Fame Johnny Mercer Award in 2003, the ASCAP &quot;Voice of Music&quot; Award in 2006 and the Ivor Novello Special International Award in 2012. According to BMI, his song &quot;By the Time I Get to Phoenix&quot; was the third most performed song in the 50 years between 1940 and 1990. Webb is the only artist ever to receive Grammy Awards for music, lyrics and orchestration.

==Early life==
Webb was born on August 15, 1946, in Elk City, Oklahoma, and raised in Laverne, Oklahoma. He grew up in a religiously conservative family; His father, Robert Lee Webb, was a Baptist minister and veteran of the United States Marine Corps who presided over rural churches in southwestern Oklahoma and west Texas. With his mother&#x27;s encouragement, Webb learned piano and organ and by the age of 12 was playing in the choir of his father&#x27;s churches, accompanied by his father on guitar and his mother on accordion. His father restricted radio listening to country music and white gospel.

During the late 1950s, Webb began applying his creativity to the music he was playing at his father&#x27;s church, frequently improvising and rearranging the hymns. He began to write religious songs at this time, but his musical direction was soon influenced by the new music being played on the radio, including the music of Elvis Presley. In 1961, at the age of 14, he bought his first record, &quot;Turn Around, Look at Me&quot;, by Glen Campbell. Webb said he was drawn to the singer&#x27;s distinctive voice and they became friends a few years later.

In 1964, Webb and his family moved to Southern California, where he attended San Bernardino Valley College, studying music. During this time, he lived in Colton, with his family. Following the death of his mother, Sylvia, in 1964, his father made plans to return to Oklahoma. Webb decided to stay in California to continue his music studies and to pursue a career as a songwriter in Los Angeles. He would later recall his father warning him about his musical aspirations, saying that &quot;This songwriting thing is going to break your heart.&quot; Seeing that his son was determined, however, he gave him $40, saying &quot;It&#x27;s not much, but it&#x27;s all I have.&quot;

==Career==
===Early success, 1965–1969===
After transcribing other people&#x27;s music for a small music publisher in Hollywood, Webb was signed to a songwriting contract with Jobete Music, the publishing arm of Motown Records. The first commercial recording of a Jimmy Webb song was &quot;My Christmas Tree&quot; by The Supremes, which appeared on their 1965 &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; album. The following year, Webb met singer and producer Johnny Rivers, who signed him to a publishing deal and recorded his song &quot;By the Time I Get to Phoenix&quot; on his 1966 album &quot;Changes&quot;. 

In 1967, Rivers released &quot;Rewind&quot;, an album featuring seven Webb songs, including &quot;Do What You Gotta Do&quot; and &quot;Tunesmith&quot;, a song also recorded that year by Vikki Carr for her album &quot;It Must Be Him&quot;. That same year, Rivers turned to Webb for material for a new group Rivers was producing called the 5th Dimension. Webb contributed five songs to their debut album, &quot;Up, Up and Away&quot;, including the title track, which was released as a single in May 1967 and reached the Top Ten. The group&#x27;s follow-up album, &quot;The Magic Garden&quot;, was also released in 1967 and featured eleven additional Webb songs, including &quot;Worst That Could Happen&quot;.

In November 1967, Glen Campbell released his version of &quot;By the Time I Get to Phoenix&quot;, which reached number 26. At the 1968 Grammy Awards, &quot;Up, Up and Away&quot; was named Record of the Year (1967) and Song of the Year (1967). &quot;Up, Up and Away&quot; and &quot;By the Time I Get to Phoenix&quot; received eight Grammy Awards between them. 

In 1968, &quot;Time&quot; acknowledged Webb&#x27;s range, proficiency, and &quot;gift for strong, varied rhythms, inventive structures, and rich, sometimes surprising harmonies&quot;. That year, the string of successful Webb songs continued with the 5th Dimension&#x27;s &quot;Paper Cup&quot; and &quot;Carpet Man&quot; reaching the Top 40, Glen Campbell&#x27;s &quot;Wichita Lineman&quot; selling over a million copies, and Johnny Maestro &amp; the Brooklyn Bridge scoring a gold record with &quot;Worst That Could Happen&quot;, a song originally recorded by the 5th Dimension. 

Webb formed his own production and publishing company that year, Canopy, and scored a hit with its first project, an unlikely album with Irish actor Richard Harris singing an album of all Webb songs. One of the songs, &quot;MacArthur Park&quot;, was a long, complex piece with multiple movements that was originally rejected by the group the Association. Despite the song&#x27;s seven minutes and twenty-one seconds length, Harris&#x27;s version reached No. 2 on the Hot 100 on June 22, 1968, and No. 4 on the UK Singles Chart on July 24. The album, &quot;A Tramp Shining&quot;, stayed on the charts for almost a year. Webb and Harris produced a follow-up album, &quot;The Yard Went On Forever&quot;, which was also successful. 

Further raising Webb&#x27;s stature as a songwriter, &quot;By the Time I Get to Phoenix&quot; was performed by Frank Sinatra on the latter&#x27;s 1968 album &quot;Cycles&quot;. Sinatra would go on to praise &quot;By the Time I Get to Phoenix&quot; as &quot;the greatest torch song ever written&quot;. 

At the 1969 Grammy Awards, Webb accepted awards for &quot;By the Time I Get to Phoenix&quot;, &quot;Wichita Lineman&quot;, and &quot;MacArthur Park&quot;. In 2019 &quot;Wichita Lineman&quot; was added to the National Recording Registry.

In 1969, Glen Campbell continued the streak of Webb hits with the gold record &quot;Galveston&quot; and &quot;Where&#x27;s the Playground Susie&quot;. Webb and Campbell had first met during the production of a General Motors commercial. Webb arrived at the recording session with his Beatle-length hair and approached the conservative singer, who looked up from his guitar and said, &quot;Get a haircut.&quot; That same year, two Webb songs became hits for the second time with Isaac Hayes&#x27; soulful version of &quot;By the Time I Get to Phoenix&quot; and Waylon Jennings&#x27; Grammy-winning country version of &quot;MacArthur Park&quot;. On Frank Sinatra&#x27;s 1969 album &quot;My Way&quot;, the singer dove deeper into Webb&#x27;s songbook with a version of &quot;Didn&#x27;t We?&quot;, a number that was originally done by Richard Harris in 1968 and released as the B-side of &quot;MacArthur Park&quot;. Webb finished the year by writing, arranging, and producing Thelma Houston&#x27;s first album, &quot;Sunshower&quot;. 

As the decade came to a close, so too did Webb&#x27;s string of hit singles. He began to withdraw from the formulaic process in which he worked and began to experiment with his music. He started work on a semi-autobiographical Broadway musical called &quot;His Own Dark City&quot;, which reflected the emotional displacement he felt at the time. He also wrote music for the films &quot;How Sweet It Is!&quot; and &quot;Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here&quot;.

===Singer-songwriter years, 1970–1982===
Webb&#x27;s career as a singer-songwriter got off to a rough start with the &quot;counterfeit&quot; album &quot;Jim Webb Sings Jim Webb&quot;, released by Epic Records in 1968. According to Webb, the album was produced &quot;by a bunch of ruffians from some old demos of mine and tarted up to sound like &#x27;MacArthur Park&#x27;&quot;. Beginning in 1970, Webb released six original albums of his own songs: &quot;Words and Music&quot; (1970), &quot;And So: On&quot; (1971), &quot;Letters&quot; (1972), &quot;Land&#x27;s End&quot; (1974), &quot;El Mirage&quot; (1977), and &quot;Angel Heart&quot; (1982). Despite the critical reception that followed each of these projects, Webb has never been as successful as a performer as he has been as a songwriter and arranger. Each album was noted for its inventive music and memorable lyrics.

Webb&#x27;s debut album as a performer, &quot;Words and Music&quot;, was released on Reprise Records in late 1970 to critical acclaim. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer Jon Landau called one of the album&#x27;s cuts, &quot;P.F. Sloan&quot;, a &quot;masterpiece [that] could not be improved upon&quot;. The album also features the ambitious song trilogy &quot;Music for an Unmade Movie&quot;. Webb&#x27;s 1971 follow-up album, &quot;And So: On&quot;, proved equally appealing to critics. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; declared the album &quot;another impressive step in the conspiracy to recover his identity from the housewives of America and rightfully install him at the forefront of contemporary composers/performers.&quot; The album features the songs &quot;Met Her on a Plane&quot;, &quot;All My Love&#x27;s Laughter&quot;, and &quot;Marionette&quot;. Also in 1971, the Three Degrees are featured in the movie &quot;The French Connection&quot; giving a rendition of Webb&#x27;s song &quot;Everybody Gets To Go To The Moon&quot;, originally recorded in 1969 by Thelma Houston.

Webb&#x27;s 1972 album &quot;Letters&quot;, which features his own rendition of &quot;Galveston&quot;, met with similar praise. Music critic Bruce Eder called &quot;Letters&quot; the &quot;most surprising, diverse, and possibly the most satisfying of all of Jimmy Webb&#x27;s early solo LPs&quot; and &quot;arguably the best of Webb&#x27;s solo albums&quot;. In his review of the album, Peter Reilly of &quot;Stereo Review&quot; wrote, &quot;Jimmy Webb is the most important pop music figure to emerge since Bob Dylan.&quot; The album also features the songs &quot;Campo de Encino&quot;, an homage to his park-like residence in Encino, California, during the 1970s, &quot;When Can Brown Begin&quot;, and &quot;Piano&quot;. 
He also produced in 1972 album, &quot;The Supremes Produced And Arranged By Jimmy Webb.&quot; for The Supremes, featuring Jean Terrell, Mary Wilson and Linda Lawrence. The album sold poorly and did not chart successfully.

In 1974, Webb released &quot;Land&#x27;s End&quot; on Asylum Records. Unlike his previous albums, which tended to be underproduced, Webb was able to achieve a more heavily produced pop/rock sound on &quot;Land&#x27;s End&quot;, which was recorded in England with the help of an all-star session band that included Joni Mitchell, Ringo Starr, and Nigel Olsson. The album contains &quot;a thematic consistency in that most of its songs were tales of romantic discord&quot;. While Webb continued to improve as a singer, he &quot;still hadn&#x27;t found an identity as a solo artist&quot;. The album features the songs &quot;Ocean in His Eyes&quot;, &quot;Just This One Time&quot;, and &quot;Crying in My Sleep&quot;.

In 1977, Webb released &quot;El Mirage&quot; on Atlantic Records. Produced, arranged, and conducted by The Beatles&#x27; former producer, George Martin, the album was Webb&#x27;s &quot;most polished effort yet as a performer&quot;. William Ruhlmann observed, &quot;These were lush tracks full of tasty playing and warm string charts on which Webb&#x27;s thin tenor was buoyed by numerous background vocalists, the whole an excellent example of the style known as &#x27;West Coast pop&#x27;.&quot; The album contains several strong compositions, including &quot;The Highwayman&quot;, which would later become a number one country hit for Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash, and Kris Kristofferson, who named their super group The Highwaymen after the song. Their version of &quot;The Highwayman&quot; won a Grammy Award for Best Country Song. &quot;El Mirage&quot; also features the songs &quot;If You See Me Getting Smaller I&#x27;m Leaving&quot;, a newly arranged version of &quot;P.F. Sloan&quot;, and &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot;, which had already been recorded by Joe Cocker, Glen Campbell, and Judy Collins. Despite the positive critical response to the album, &quot;El Mirage&quot; did not succeed in redefining Webb as a performer as he had hoped.

Webb&#x27;s final solo album from this period, &quot;Angel Heart&quot;, was released in 1982 on Lorimar Records. Like its predecessor, the album drew upon the talents of top Los Angeles session musicians to produce a classic West Coast pop sound, enhanced by guest vocal harmonies by Gerry Beckley, Michael McDonald, Graham Nash, Kenny Loggins, Daryl Hall, and Stephen Bishop. Unlike his previous solo albums, however, &quot;Angel Heart&quot; lacked the quality material usually associated with the composer. Apart from &quot;Scissors Cut&quot; and &quot;In Cars&quot;, which were previously recorded by Art Garfunkel, the album offered few high points, despite its polished production. A decade would pass before Webb released his next solo album.

Throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s, Webb&#x27;s songs continued to be recorded by some of the industry&#x27;s most successful artists. In 1972, Jimmy Webb produced The Supremes&#x27; last album featuring Jean Terrell as lead singer, &quot;The Supremes Produced and Arranged by Jimmy Webb&quot;. Webb is quoted as saying he had a crush on Mary Wilson when he wrote and produced &quot;I Keep It Hid&quot; featuring her on lead vocals. In 1977, the initial release of Art Garfunkel&#x27;s &quot;Watermark&quot; album consisted exclusively of songs by Webb. In 1978, Donna Summer&#x27;s disco version of &quot;MacArthur Park&quot; became a multi-million selling vinyl single that was number one on the American pop music charts for three weeks. In 1980, Thelma Houston recorded &quot;Before There Could Be Me&quot;, &quot;Breakwater Cat&quot;, &quot;Gone&quot;, &quot;Long Lasting Love&quot;, and &quot;What Was that Song&quot; on her album &quot;Breakwater Cat&quot;. Leah Kunkel recorded &quot;Never Gonna Lose My Dream of Love Again&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Begin&quot; for her album &quot;I Run with Trouble&quot;. The latter was performed live in 1980 by the born-again Bob Dylan. Tanya Tucker recorded &quot;Tennessee Woman&quot; on her album &quot;Dreamlovers&quot;. And Frank Sinatra did his own cover of &quot;MacArthur Park&quot; on the 1980 album &quot;&quot;.

In 1981, Art Garfunkel recorded &quot;Scissors Cut&quot;, &quot;In Cars&quot;, and &quot;That&#x27;s All I&#x27;ve Got to Say&quot; for his album &quot;Scissors Cut&quot;, and Arlo Guthrie recorded &quot;Oklahoma Nights&quot; on his album &quot;Power of Love&quot;. In 1982, Linda Ronstadt recorded &quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot; and &quot;Easy for You to Say&quot; on her album &quot;Get Closer&quot;. That same year, Joe Cocker recorded &quot;Just Like Always&quot; on his album &quot;Sheffield Steel&quot;, and the Everly Brothers recorded &quot;She Never Smiles Anymore&quot; on their album &quot;Living Legends&quot;.

In 1981 Webb moved to New York state, and said, &quot;One day I wondered what happened to the Seventies and all those grandiose schemes.&quot;

===Large-scale projects, 1982–1992===
From 1982 to 1992, Webb turned his focus from solo performing to large-scale projects, such as film scores, Broadway musicals, and classical music. In 1982, he produced the soundtrack for the film &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot;, an animated children&#x27;s tale, with the musical group America performing five new Jimmy Webb songs: &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot;, &quot;Man&#x27;s Road&quot;, &quot;In the Sea&quot;, &quot;Now That I&#x27;m a Woman&quot;, and &quot;That&#x27;s All I&#x27;ve Got to Say&quot;. The rest of the album contains instrumental music composed, arranged, and conducted by Webb. That same year, he composed the soundtrack to all episodes of the TV series &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot;.

The theme music for the 1984-85 TV sitcom &quot;E/R&quot; was written by Webb. Then in 1985, Glen Campbell recorded Webb&#x27;s &quot;Cowboy Hall of Fame&quot; and &quot;Shattered&quot; for the album &quot;It&#x27;s Just a Matter of Time&quot;. And heavyweights Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, and Kris Kristofferson recorded &quot;Highwayman&quot; on the album &quot;Highwayman&quot;. In 1988, Toto recorded &quot;Home of the Brave&quot; on the album &quot;The Seventh One&quot;. Kenny Rankin recorded &quot;She Moves, Eyes Follow&quot; for the album &quot;Hiding in Myself&quot;. And in 1989, Linda Ronstadt recorded the album &quot;Cry Like a Rainstorm, Howl Like the Wind&quot;, which featured four Jimmy Webb songs: &quot;Still Within the Sound of My Voice&quot; (with Webb playing piano), &quot;Adios&quot; (with orchestral arrangement by Webb), &quot;I Keep It Hid&quot; (with Webb playing piano), and &quot;Shattered&quot;. In 1990, John Denver recorded &quot;Postcard from Paris&quot; on the album &quot;The Flower That Shattered the Stone&quot;. In 1991, Kenny Rogers recorded &quot;They Just Don&#x27;t Make Em Like You Anymore&quot; on the album &quot;Back Home Again&quot;.

In 1986, Webb produced a cantata, &quot;The Animals&#x27; Christmas&quot;, with Art Garfunkel, Amy Grant, and the London Symphony Orchestra. The cantata tells the Christmas story from the perspective of animals.

In 1987, Webb produced the soundtrack for the film &quot;The Hanoi Hilton&quot;. That same year, he reunited with Campbell for the album &quot;Still Within the Sound of My Voice&quot;, for which he wrote the title song. They followed this up in 1988 with an album composed almost entirely of Jimmy Webb songs, &quot;Light Years&quot;. The album included the title song, as well as &quot;Lightning in a Bottle&quot;, &quot;If These Walls Could Speak&quot; (which was also recorded by Amy Grant that year) and &quot;Our Movie&quot;. Two songs from 1982&#x27;s &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; also appear on the album. The record also included the songs &quot;Other People&#x27;s Lives&quot;, &quot;Wasn&#x27;t There A Moment&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know How To Love You Anymore&quot;, and &quot;Is There Love After You&quot;. Several of these songs later ended up on Webb solo albums.

In 1992, Webb completed a musical called &quot;Instant Intimacy&quot;, which he developed with the Tennessee Repertory Theatre. The musical contained new songs that he and others would later record, including &quot;What Does a Woman See in a Man&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know How to Love You Anymore&quot;, and &quot;Is There Love After You&quot;. That same year, Webb performed live at the club Cinegrill, performing &quot;What Does a Woman See in a Man&quot; and introducing several additional new songs, including &quot;Sandy Cove&quot; and an old folk hymn, &quot;I Will Arise&quot;.

===Solo artist, 1993–present===
Since 1993, Webb has produced five critically acclaimed solo albums: &quot;Suspending Disbelief&quot; (1993), &quot;Ten Easy Pieces&quot; (1996), &quot;Twilight of the Renegades&quot; (2005), &quot;Just Across the River&quot; (2010), and &quot;Still Within the Sound of My Voice&quot; (2013). He has continued to expand his creative landscape to include musicals, commercial jingles, and film scores.

In 1994, Webb teamed with Nanci Griffith to contribute the song &quot;If These Old Walls Could Speak&quot; to the AIDS benefit album &quot;Red Hot + Country&quot; produced by the Red Hot Organization.

In 1997, Webb co-produced Carly Simon&#x27;s &quot;Film Noir&quot; album and contributed his vocals, orchestration, and piano skills to the project, which was filmed for an AMC documentary (which premiered in September 1997). He also co-wrote the song &quot;Film Noir&quot; with Simon and reprised his role as arranger and co-producer on Simon&#x27;s 2008 album, &quot;This Kind of Love&quot;.

In 1998, Webb completed his first book, &quot;Tunesmith: Inside the Art of Songwriting&quot;, which was published by Hyperion Books. It was well-received by songwriters and performers and became a best-seller. One book reviewer described it as &quot;a companion every serious songwriter should read, and read again, and keep handy for referral&quot;.
In 2007, he released a live album of his show &quot;Live and at Large&quot;, which was recorded in the United Kingdom. The album included personal stories and anecdotes about Richard Harris, Waylon Jennings, Harry Nilsson, Glen Campbell, Art Garfunkel, Frank Sinatra, and Rosemary Clooney.

Webb appears in the 2008 documentary &quot;The Wrecking Crew&quot; providing thoughtful and descriptive insights into the world of California session musicians in the 1960s.

In June 2010, Webb released &quot;Just Across the River&quot;, an album of newly arranged Webb songs that featured guest appearances by Vince Gill, Billy Joel, Willie Nelson, Lucinda Williams, Jackson Browne, Glen Campbell, Michael McDonald, Mark Knopfler, JD Souther, and Linda Ronstadt.

In 2011, Webb was unanimously elected chairman of the Songwriters Hall of Fame, replacing Hal David who retired after ten years in the position.

In May 2012, Webb traveled to London to receive the Ivor Novello Special International Award, which recognizes non-British writers and composers who have made an extraordinary contribution to the global musical landscape. In September 2012, Fantasy Records released &quot;Glen Campbell and Jimmy Webb: In Session&quot;, a collaborative album by Campbell and Webb. The album and its accompanying DVD were filmed and recorded in December 1988 at the Hamilton, Ontario, studios of CHCH-TV as part of the Canadian concert series &quot;In Session&quot;.

Decades after he sold his first song, Webb&#x27;s influence on his fellow musicians is ongoing. Rock singer-songwriter Bruce Springsteen has acknowledged that his 2019 album &quot;Western Stars&quot; was profoundly impacted by Webb&#x27;s music, and country music singer Keith Urban cites Webb as his earliest songwriting inspiration.

Webb continues to perform throughout the United States and abroad. In 2017 he published an autobiography, &quot;The Cake and the Rain: A Memoir&quot;.

In 2024, Webb&#x27;s song &quot;MacArthur Park&quot; by both Donna Summer and Richard Harris was included in the &quot;Beetlejuice Beetlejuice&quot; soundtrack.

==Emotional content of songs==
While some of Webb&#x27;s songs are happy, such as &quot;Up, Up and Away&quot;, he has said that &quot;The territory I tend to inhabit is that sort of &#x27;crushed lonely hearts&#x27; thing. The first part of a relationship is usually that white-hot centre when all the happy songs come. When that&#x27;s gone it can be devastating, and that&#x27;s when the sorrowful songs come.&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1967 Webb wrote &quot;MacArthur Park&quot;; the inspiration for the song was his relationship and breakup with Susie Horton. The breakup was also the primary influence for his composition &quot;By the Time I Get to Phoenix&quot;.

Webb married cover girl Patricia &quot;Patsy&quot; Sullivan, the mother of his 17-month-old son Christiaan, in 1974. The youngest child of screen actor Barry Sullivan and Swedish actress and model Gita Hall, Sullivan was 12 years old and Webb was 22 when they met on a photo shoot for the cover of &quot;Teen Magazine&quot; in 1968. Webb became romantically involved with Sullivan, the face of Yardley Cosmetics, a year later. She gave birth to their son Christiaan, the first of their six children, when she was 16 years old. They married on July 13, 1974, in a wedding held at Jim Messina&#x27;s Ojai, California, ranch. Musicians who attended the wedding included Joe Cocker, Kenny Loggins, Joni Mitchell, Harry Nilsson, and Ike Turner, plus actors Beau Bridges, Lynda Carter, Andrew Prine, Jessica Walter, and Jack Warden. They were divorced in 1996. 

Two sons, Christiaan and Justin, formed a rock band, the Webb Brothers. Their brother, James, later joined the band. Webb collaborated with his sons on the album &quot;Cottonwood Farm&quot;, which also featured his father Bob Webb.

In 2004, Webb married Laura Savini, a host and producer for the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). From 1996 to 2011, Savini was vice president of marketing and communications at WLIW, a PBS station on Long Island, New York. The couple first met backstage on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1999 at Billy Joel&#x27;s 2000 Years: The Millennium Concert at Madison Square Garden. Webb said, &quot;I was drunk at the time ... I met her again a couple of years later and barely remembered meeting her the first time.&quot; Their second meeting took place when Savini interviewed Webb for her series on the arts.

===Friendships===
Webb had close personal relationships with Glen Campbell and actor Richard Harris, both of whom had great success singing his songs. Hearing Campbell on the radio singing &quot;Turn Around, Look at Me&quot; inspired him when he was 15 years old in 1961. A life-long friend, Webb thought of Campbell as a &quot;big brother&quot;.

He said of Richard Harris, the Irish actor with a reputation as a serious alcoholic and substance abuser, &quot;Richard was a major figure in my life at a time when I needed someone like him to show me how to smoke a cigarette and drink whisky. It was kind of learning how men really live, and we had the time of our lives.&quot;

===Substance abuse===
In his memoir and in interviews with the press, Webb has been frank about his problems with substance abuse, which included frequent use of cocaine, marijuana, and alcohol. He stated that using cocaine was pervasive in the music industry during the 1970s as recording sessions typically were long and cocaine provided the energy to keep on recording. &quot;[Cocaine] had become legal tender. You could get studio musicians with it. You could get a date for the evening. Cocaine was in the executive suites of all the major record companies. It became cool; there was no social stigma attached to it. Au contraire: Most people didn&#x27;t set off for an evening&#x27;s dinner engagement and party after without your stash.&quot;

Webb suffered a near-fatal overdose of phencyclidine in 1973 while snorting the drug with his friend, singer-songwriter Harry Nilsson. He used cocaine with Nilsson and John Lennon during the former Beatle&#x27;s &quot;Lost Weekend&quot; and often supplied Lennon with drugs. He ceased his cocaine habit in the early 1990s. He gave up alcohol and marijuana and cocaine after his divorce and revived his performing career. A heavy user of both substances, Webb has been clean and sober since 2000.

Webb once owned Carroll Shelby&#x27;s 427 AC Cobra Super Snake, a twin of the Cobra that Bill Cosby talked about on his album &quot;200 M.P.H.&quot;.

<text>The 5th Dimension is an American vocal group. Their music encompasses Sunshine Pop, Pop Soul, and Psychedelic Soul. They were an important crossover music act of the 1960s and 1970s, although both praised and derided for their particular musical approach and mass appeal. During the original group&#x27;s heyday, they were twice invited to perform at the U.S. White House, and accepting the invitations was controversial during that era of social upheaval.

Formed as the Versatiles in late 1965, the group changed its name to &quot;The 5th Dimension&quot; by 1966. Between 1967 and 1973, they charted with 20 &quot;Top 40&quot; hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, two of which – &quot;Up, Up and Away&quot; (No. 7, 1967) and the 1969 No. 1 &quot;Medley: Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In (The Flesh Failures)&quot; — won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year. Other big hits include &quot;Stoned Soul Picnic&quot; (No. 3), &quot;Wedding Bell Blues&quot; (No. 1), &quot;One Less Bell to Answer&quot; (No. 2), a cover of &quot;Never My Love&quot; (Pop chart, No. 12/Easy Listening No. 1), &quot;(Last Night) I Didn&#x27;t Get to Sleep at All&quot; (No. 8), and &quot;If I Could Reach You&quot; (Pop chart No. 10/Easy Listening No. 1). Three of their records reached the Top Ten of &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Rhythm &amp; Blues/Soul chart. 5 of their 19 &quot;Top 20&quot; hits on the Easy Listening chart reached the No. 1 position.

The five original members were Lamonte McLemore, Marilyn McCoo, Florence LaRue, Ronald Townson, and Billy Davis Jr. Their earliest recordings were on the Soul City record label, which was started by recording artist Johnny Rivers. The group later recorded for Bell/Arista Records, ABC Records, and Motown Records. 

=== Contribution of the composers ===
Some of the songwriters who worked with The 5th Dimension went on to establish successful performance careers of their own, notably Ashford &amp; Simpson, who wrote the song &quot;California Soul&quot;. The group is also notable for having more success with the songs of Laura Nyro than Nyro did herself, particularly with &quot;Stoned Soul Picnic&quot;, &quot;Sweet Blindness&quot;, &quot;Wedding Bell Blues&quot;, &quot;Blowin&#x27; Away&quot; and &quot;Save the Country&quot;. The group also recorded songs by well-known songwriters including Burt Bacharach and Hal David (&quot;One Less Bell to Answer&quot; et al.) and Jimmy Webb, who wrote their first significant hit, &quot;Up, Up and Away&quot;. The group&#x27;s 1967 LP, &quot;The Magic Garden&quot;, features an 11 track song-cycle composed by Webb. In all, the original lineup of The 5th Dimension recorded 24 different Jimmy Webb compositions by the end of 1975.

=== Contribution of producer &quot;Bones&quot; Howe ===
All but two of The 5th Dimension&#x27;s original albums were produced by Bones Howe, who had been a sound engineer for the likes of Frank Sinatra, Bobby Darin, Mel Torme, Johnny Rivers and Phil Spector, before producing and engineering hits for a number of young, contemporary acts, including The Association, The Turtles and The Mamas &amp; the Papas. Howe employed members of the &quot;Wrecking Crew&quot; on all of The 5th Dimension recordings under his direction. (The Wrecking Crew provided backing or replacement instrumentation for many bands recording in Los Angeles whose own musicianship skills were deemed not of a professional level by their record producer - a common practice of the era). In the case of The 5th Dimension, there were no backing musicians for the vocal group so the Wrecking Crew became their defacto accompanists and instrumental arrangers. The contributions of the rhythm section in particular (consisting of Joe Osborn on bass, Hal Blaine on drums, and Larry Bunker on percussion) on these recordings are notable: Osborn and Blaine opting to be the rhythm section on most every 5th Dimension album and single recorded up through 1975. And their Wrecking Crew cohort, keyboardist/guitarist Larry Knechtel, was a constant presence as well. Being able to rely upon the same producer and group of musicians helped to give The 5th Dimension recordings a distinct and cohesive sound from album to album. Most other purely vocal groups of the time were stuck working with whoever got assigned to individual recording sessions - and didn&#x27;t have much say in it.

Vocal arrangements on The 5th Dimension albums were handled by Bob Alcivar, an American music producer, arranger, composer, conductor and keyboard player.

==Career==
===Formation===
In 1963, LaMonte McLemore and Marilyn McCoo got together with three fellow vocalists from Los Angeles—Harry Elston, Lawrence Summers, and Fritz Baskett—to form a Jazz-oriented vocal group called The Hi-Fi&#x27;s. Ray Charles signed The Hi-Fi&#x27;s as his touring opening act in 1963. The vocal group&#x27;s name was changed to The Vocals, and they recorded a single, &quot;Lonesome Mood&quot; on Tangerine Records in 1963. When The Vocals broke up in 1964, McLemore and McCoo teamed up with two of McLemore&#x27;s childhood acquaintances from St. Louis (now looking for music opportunities in Los Angeles): aspiring Opera singer Ron Townson, and Gospel and R&amp;B singer Billy Davis Jr. And a second female singer was recruited: Florence LaRue, who — like McCoo — had won the Grand Talent award in the annual Miss Bronze beauty pageant, and had also been photographed by McLemore for the event.

The members began rehearsing as The Versatiles in late 1965. McLemore had been a staff photographer at Motown West in Los Angeles for a short period, so he connected with Marc Gordon, Motown&#x27;s Senior Vice President in Los Angeles, to arrange for a meeting. Gordon gave The Versatiles permission to record some existing Motown songs as a demo tape, but it was left to McLemore to fly to Detroit and meet with Motown head, Berry Gordy and play the audition tape for him. According to McLemore, Gordy&#x27;s response to the tape was non-committal:
&quot;Man, you all sound great, but I don&#x27;t hear no hit. So just go back and cut some more.&quot;
Although Gordy had not immediately offered a recording contract to The Versatiles, Marc Gordon believed they had something special, and offered to manage the group. Gordon brought them to the attention of popular singer Johnny Rivers, who had just started his own label, Soul City Records. Soul City signed the group on the spot, but Rivers insisted on a new name. Townson and his wife came up with &quot;The 5th Dimension,&quot; and as Davis recalled later, &quot;We all heard it, we all agreed right away, &#x27;That&#x27;s got to be it!&#x27;&quot; In November 1966, Soul City released their first single as The 5th Dimension, &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Lovin&#x27; You Forever&quot;, with a decidedly Motown-flavored arrangement. However, the song failed to chart.

===Major hits===

In 1967 The 5th Dimension recorded &quot;Go Where You Wanna Go,&quot; which became a breakthrough hit for them. The song was a John Phillips tune and reached No. 16 on the US Hot 100 chart. The group followed this with &quot;Up, Up and Away&quot;, which reached No. 7 later that same year and went on to win five Grammy Awards. The following year, the group scored major hit singles with Laura Nyro&#x27;s songs &quot;Stoned Soul Picnic&quot; (U.S. No. 3) and &quot;Sweet Blindness&quot; (U.S. No. 13). The group received a gold record for their album &quot;Stoned Soul Picnic&quot;.

That album included &quot;California Soul&quot;, which peaked at No. 25 in February 1969. Weeks later the group&#x27;s success broke wide open, with &quot;Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In&quot; from the musical &quot;Hair&quot; topping the Hot 100 for six straight weeks in April and May and another Nyro song, &quot;Wedding Bell Blues&quot;, doing the same for the first three full weeks in November. Their cover of Neil Sedaka&#x27;s &quot;Workin&#x27; On a Groovy Thing&quot; went to No. 20 in between. Those four singles kept the group on the Hot 100 for all but four weeks in 1969. By some reckonings, &quot;Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In&quot; was the biggest hit single for 1969.

Later top 20 hits included 1970&#x27;s &quot;One Less Bell to Answer&quot; (U.S. No. 2), 1971&#x27;s &quot;Love&#x27;s Lines, Angles and Rhymes&quot; (U.S. No. 19) and &quot;Never My Love&quot; (U.S. No. 12), and 1972&#x27;s &quot;(Last Night) I Didn&#x27;t Get to Sleep at All&quot; (U.S. No. 8) and &quot;If I Could Reach You&quot; (U.S. No. 10). The group had seven other top 40 hits, the last being 1973&#x27;s &quot;Living Together, Growing Together&quot; (U.S. No. 32) from the film &quot;Lost Horizon&quot;.

===TV and film appearances===

===Regrouping===
In 1975, McCoo and Davis, who had married on July 26, 1969, left the group to do collective and individual projects. The duo had success with &quot;Your Love&quot; and the chart topper &quot;You Don&#x27;t Have to Be a Star (To Be in My Show)&quot;, which won them their seventh Grammy award as well as their own television variety show, The Marilyn McCoo &amp; Billy Davis Jr. show. Marilyn McCoo served a lengthy 1980s stint as the host of the TV show &quot;Solid Gold&quot;.

===21st century===

, the group was actively touring as &quot;The 5th Dimension featuring Florence LaRue,&quot; led by LaRue, with Willie Williams, Leonard Tucker, Patrice Morris and Floyd Smith.

On June 21, 2016, The 5th Dimension featuring Florence LaRue performed in The Villages, Florida just days after the Orlando nightclub shooting. LaRue took the opportunity to share her thoughts on the shooting: &quot;We will not be terrorized. We know what&#x27;s happening in the world, but this is a song about good health, love, peace and happiness. We still believe in those things today,&quot; she stated before the group performed &quot;Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In&quot;.

In November 2017, The 5th Dimension appeared for 18 performances at the Andy Williams Performing Arts Centre in Branson, Missouri, in the Andy Williams Christmas Extravaganza hosted by Jimmy Osmond.

== Legacy and critical reception ==

David Brown:For a brief period in the late 1960s, the 5th Dimension fully realized the post-racial crossover success that [Motown&#x27;s] Gordy had imagined for his stars, while raising the legitimate question of what it means to sound Black in music.
To listen to the 5th Dimension was to hear a mélange of middle-of-the road Pop, show-tunes, folk music, with flourishes of Jazz, Soul, and a tinge of Gospel. If music were to sound like America, it might sound like the 5th Dimension – at least in the 1960s.

Mark Anthony Neal:But in a scenario that&#x27;s nearly impossible to imagine for a modern act, the 5th Dimension also became victims of their own success. In an extended &quot;Summer of Soul&quot; [film] segment, Davis and Marilyn McCoo, the group&#x27;s most prominent female member, rewatch the footage with equal degrees pride and pain. &quot;We were constantly being attacked because we weren&#x27;t &#x27;black enough,&#x27;&quot; McCoo says. &quot;Sometimes we were called the black group with the white sound, and we didn&#x27;t like that. … Our voices sound the way they sound. How do you color a sound?&quot; As Davis adds, &quot;Everyone thought we were a white act until they saw pictures.&quot; Those poignant moments recall similar put-downs that Whitney Houston endured two decades later, after she began pulling in both black and white audiences with her first two albums.

Caroline Sullivan:Playing a show at the White House for president Richard Nixon in 1970 only cemented the idea that they were part of the establishment, though LaRue – the only original member who still tours under the 5th Dimension name – has said they were no fans of Nixon. &quot;It was an honour to perform for the president of the United States, [but he] wasn&#x27;t necessarily the president of our choice.&quot; No matter; they couldn&#x27;t undo what we would now call the reputational damage, despite the fact that one of the songs they played at the White House was &quot;The Declaration&quot;, a powerful folk-pop appeal for racial unity.

[The medley of &quot;The Declaration / A Change Is Gonna Come / People Gotta Be Free&quot; was recorded for the &quot;Portrait&quot; album. The U.S. Declaration of Independence as written by Thomas Jefferson is sung by the group before segueing into Sam Cooke&#x27;s socially-conscious &quot;A Change Is Gonna Come.&quot; The musical treatment of &quot;The Declaration&quot; was first created for the play &quot;Bread, Beans and Things.&quot; The recorded version by The 5th Dimension was refused play on Armed Forces radio during the Vietnam era &quot;as they felt it depicted overthrowing the government&quot;.]

==Honors==
The group was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2002.

The 5th Dimension was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2003 for the 1967 single, &quot;Up, Up and Away.&quot; 

The original lineup of The 5th Dimension performed for the U.S. president, staff and invitees at the White House in 1970 and 1972.

The Florence LaRue-led group later performed again at the White House in September of 1982.

The group was invited by the U.S. State Department to represent the country as part of the US Cultural Exchange Program in 1973. This involved a Goodwill Tour of Eastern Europe, giving concerts and talks in Ankara and Istanbul, Turkey, Bucharest and Ploesti, Romania, Warsaw and Katowice, Poland, and Ostrava, Bratislava and Prague in Czechoslovakia.

They have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, inducted August 9, 1991, and the St. Louis Walk of Fame, inducted on March 18, 2010.

<doc id="83108" wikidata="Q301818" url="?curid=83108" title="Aaron Carter">
<text>Aaron Charles Carter (December 7, 1987November 5, 2022) was an American singer and rapper. He came to fame as a teen pop singer in the late 1990s, establishing himself as a star among preteen and teenage audiences during the first years of the 21st century, with his four studio albums.

Carter began performing at age seven, after the formation of his brother Nick&#x27;s group the Backstreet Boys, and released his self-titled debut album in 1997 at age nine, selling a million copies worldwide. His second album &quot;Aaron&#x27;s Party (Come Get It)&quot; (2000) sold three million copies in the United States, and Carter began making guest appearances on Nickelodeon and touring with the Backstreet Boys shortly after the record&#x27;s release. Carter&#x27;s next album, &quot;Oh Aaron&quot;, also went platinum, and in 2002 he released what would be his last studio album for over 15 years, &quot;Another Earthquake!&quot;, followed by his 2003 &quot;Most Requested Hits&quot; collection.

Carter appeared on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, and in the Broadway musical &quot;Seussical&quot; and the off-Broadway musical &quot;The Fantasticks&quot;, and made several one-off performances. In 2014, he released a single featuring rapper Pat SoLo, &quot;Ooh Wee&quot;. Carter released the single &quot;Fool&#x27;s Gold&quot; in 2016, and an EP titled &quot;Love&quot; in 2017. His fifth studio album, also titled &quot;Love&quot;, was released in 2018. A sixth album, &quot;Blacklisted&quot;, was released two days after his accidental drug-related death.

==Early life==
Aaron Charles Carter was born on December 7, 1987, in Tampa, Florida. His parents, Jane Eleonora Schneck (née Spaulding, previously Carter) and Robert Gene Carter (1952–2017), ran a retirement home. He had an older brother, Nick, a member of the Backstreet Boys, and three sisters: his twin, Angel, a model; Bobbie Jean (BJ) (1982–2023); and Leslie (1986–2012). In addition to his full siblings, he also had an older half-sister, Ginger Lee Carter (1972–2023), and a younger half-brother, Kaden Carter. The family was originally from Jamestown, New York. Carter attended Frank D. Miles Elementary School and the Ruskin School in Florida.

Carter&#x27;s parents divorced in 2004; he was told about the divorce one hour before filming his &quot;MTV Cribs&quot; episode. In accordance with the California Child Actor&#x27;s Bill, Carter&#x27;s parents were supposed to put 15% of his earnings into a Coogan account. As per Carter, &quot;I got[...] $2 million when I turned 18 years old. I should have had at least $20 million in my account.&quot; After he turned 18 in 2005, Carter learned that he owed $4 million in back taxes. Carter claimed that his earnings had helped his parents purchase 30 cars and 15 houses; however, he did not receive any portion of the profits when they sold the properties. He also claimed that his father fired a .44 Magnum near his ear to coerce him into signing a $256,000 check. This left Carter with 70% deafness in one ear.

Carter also had a tumultuous relationship with his siblings, with many of their feuds playing out on social media in later years. In September 2019, Carter leveled allegations of sexual abuse against his sister Leslie, who died of a drug overdose in 2012. Carter reported that the abuse began when he was ten years old, ended when he was 13, and occurred when Leslie would fail to take prescribed medication for her bipolar disorder. He also accused his brother Nick of life-long abuse, and implied that Nick also abused a female family member. Nick&#x27;s legal team denied the allegations, which surfaced after Nick and their sister Angel sought restraining orders against Aaron, who reportedly confessed to thoughts of killing Nick&#x27;s then-pregnant wife, Lauren.

==Career==
===1997–1999: Music beginnings and self-titled debut album===
Carter began his career as the lead singer of Dead End as a 7-year-old. He left the band after two years because he wanted to perform pop music, while the other members were interested in alternative rock.

Carter made his first solo appearance at age 9, singing The Jets&#x27; &quot;Crush on You&quot; when opening for the Backstreet Boys in Berlin in March 1997. The performance was followed by a record contract, and in the fall of 1997, he released his first single &quot;Crush on You&quot;. Carter&#x27;s self-titled debut studio album was released on December 1, 1997. The album achieved gold status in Canada, Denmark, Germany, Norway, and Spain, and was released in the United States on June 16, 1998.

The album included the hit singles, &quot;I Want Candy&quot;, &quot;Aaron&#x27;s Party (Come Get It)&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s How I Beat Shaq&quot;, and &quot;Bounce&quot;, all of which received airplay on Disney Channel and Nickelodeon.

On March 13, 2003, Pearlman was declared in contempt of court for ignoring a court order to produce documents relating to royalty payments; however, the suit itself was settled out of court.

A real-life motocross racer, Carter also appeared in the 2005 film &quot;Supercross&quot;.

On March 21, 2006, Trans Continental filed a lawsuit against Carter with the Los Angeles County Superior Court, citing that Carter reneged on a recording deal. Carter signed the contract on December 7, 2004, when he was 17; his attorney argued that Carter had the right to &quot;cancel or void various agreements&quot; that were signed when he was a minor.

An album of the same name was released as his fifth studio album on February 16, 2018.

Two days after his death on November 5, 2022, &quot;Blacklisted&quot; was released on all music platforms by its producers as a tribute to Carter. The album was originally to be released on December 7, which would have been Carter&#x27;s 35th Birthday.

He was cremated, and his ashes were left in the care of his twin sister Angel. The cause of death was not immediately publicized, but the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner later ruled that Carter&#x27;s death was accidental: drowning after inhaling difluoroethane and taking alprazolam.

Carter&#x27;s ashes were interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills).

<doc id="83109" wikidata="Q6497053" url="?curid=83109" title="Rig (sailing)">
<text>A sailing vessel&#x27;s rig is its arrangement of masts, sails and rigging. Examples include a schooner rig, cutter rig, junk rig, etc. A rig may be broadly categorized as &quot;fore-and-aft&quot;, &quot;square&quot;, or a combination of both. Within the fore-and-aft category there is a variety of triangular and quadrilateral sail shapes. Spars or battens may be used to help shape a given kind of sail. Each rig may be described with a sail plan—formally, a drawing of a vessel, viewed from the side.

Modern examples of single-person sailing craft, such as windsurfers, iceboats, and land-sailing craft, typically have uncomplicated rigs with a single sail on a mast with a boom.

== Introduction ==
In the English language, ships were usually described, until the end of the eighteenth century, in terms of their type of hull design. Using the type of rig as the main type identifier for a vessel became common only in the nineteenth century. This is illustrated by the terminology for ships in the large fleet of colliers that traded to London from the coal ports of the Northeast of England (of which was a well-known example). Many of these full-rigged ships (square rigged on all of three masts) had the hull type &quot;bark&quot;another common classification was &quot;cat&quot;. In the second half of the eighteenth century, the square sails on the mizzen were often eliminated. The resulting rig acquired the name of the hull type: initially as &quot;bark&quot; and soon as &quot;barque&quot;. This explains the Royal Navy&#x27;s description of &quot;Endeavour&quot; as a &quot;cat-built bark&quot;.

== Design ==
Each rig may be described with a sail plan—a drawing of a vessel, viewed from the side, depicting its sails, the spars that carry them and some of the rigging that supports the rig. By extension, &quot;sail plan&quot; describes the arrangement of sails on a vessel. A well-designed sail plan should be balanced, requiring only light forces on the helm to keep the sailing craft on course. The fore-and-aft center of effort on a sail plan is usually slightly behind the center of resistance of the hull, so that the sailing craft will tend to turn into the wind if the helm is unattended. The height of the sail plan&#x27;s center of effort above the surface is limited by the sailing craft&#x27;s ability to avoid capsize, which is a function of its hull shape, ballast, or hull spacing (in the case of catamarans and trimarans).

===Types of rig===
* &quot;Fore-and-aft rig&quot; features sails that run fore and aft (along the length of the sailing craft), controlled by lines called &quot;sheets&quot;, that changes sides, as the bow passes through the wind from one side of the craft to the other. Fore-and-aft rig variants include:
**&quot;Bermuda rig&quot; (also known as a &quot;Marconi rig&quot;) features a three-sided mainsail.
**&quot;Gaff rig&quot; features a four-sided mainsail with the upper edge made fast to a spar called a gaff.
** &quot;Spritsail rig&quot; features a four-sided mainsail with the aft upper corner supported by a diagonal spar, called a sprit, whose lower end meets the mast near the foot of the sail.
**&quot;Lateen rig&quot; features a three-sided sail set on a long yard, mounted at an angle on the mast and running in a fore-and-aft direction.
**&quot;Crab claw sail&quot; (also known as &quot;Oceanic sprit&quot; or &quot;Oceanic lateen&quot;) features a three-sided sail with spars on both the foot and the head. It&#x27;s either mastless, supported by a &quot;prop&quot;, or mounted on removable or fixed masts.
**&quot;Tanja sail&quot; (also known as &quot;canted square/rectangular sail&quot;, &quot;balance lugsail&quot;, or &quot;boomed lugsail&quot;) features a four-sided sail with spars on both the foot and the head. It&#x27;s mounted on removable or fixed masts.
* &quot;Square rig&quot; uses square sails as the major sails on a vessel. It is common for square rigged vessels to include some fore and aft sails, such as staysails. A mast may be referred to as a square rigged mast where square sails predominatethis would differentiate from other masts on the same vessel being fore-and-aft rigged, for example in a barque.&lt;br&gt;Square sails are generally suspended from yards which, when at rest, are at right angles (&quot;square&quot;) to the centre-line of the vessel. This differentiates them from fore-and-aft sails, which are aligned along the centre-line when at rest. Operationally, this means that square sails always present the same surface of the sail to the wind when propelling a vessel forward: they have a front and a back. Fore-and-aft sails can have either of their surfaces facing the wind when in use. Hence either vertical edge of a square sail may be the front (when sailing to windward) but fore-and-aft sails always have the same vertical edge at the front.

=== Types of sail ===
Each form of rig requires its own type of sails. Among them are:
* A &quot;staysail&quot; (pronounced stays&#x27;l) is a fore-and-aft sail whose leading edge (or luff) is hanked to a stay.
* A &quot;headsail&quot; is any sail forward of the foremost mast on a sailing boat. It is usually a fore-and-aft sail, but on older sailing ships would include a square-sail on a bowsprit.
* A &quot;jib&quot; is a headsail that is set in front of any other headsails, or in modern usage, may be the only headsail. It may be hanked to a stay, used in roller reefing or set flying (as in the more traditional cutter rigs). In a large vessel with many headsails, you may, for example, find a flying jib, outer-jib, inner-jib and then the fore-staysail.
* A &quot;genoa&quot; is a large jib that increases area by extending rearward of the mast.
* A &quot;spinnaker&quot; is a full sail of light material for use when sailing downwind in light airs. When in use, the jib or genoa would be lowered.
* A &quot;gennaker&quot; is a sail that is a cross between a genoa and a spinnaker.
* A &quot;mainsail&quot; (&quot;mains&#x27;l&quot;) is a sail attached to the main mast. The principal types include:
*# A square-rig mainsail is a square sail attached at the bottom of the main mast.
*# A Bermuda-rig mainsail is a triangular sail with the luff attached to the mast with the foot or lower edge generally attached to a boom.
*# A gaff-rig mainsail is a quadrilateral sail whose head is supported by a gaff.
*# A spritsail-rig mainsail is a quadrilateral sail whose aft head is supported by a sprit.
* A &quot;lug sail&quot; is an asymmetric quadrilateral sail suspended on a spar and hoisted up the mast as a fore-and-aft sail.
* A &quot;mizzen sail&quot; is a small triangular or quadrilateral sail at the stern of a boat.
* A &quot;steadying sail&quot; is a mizzen sail on motor vessels such as old-fashioned drifters and navy ships (such as ). The sail&#x27;s prime function is to reduce rolling rather than to provide drive.


== European and American vessels ==
Ships that sailed from Europe and the Americas could be categorized in a variety of ways, by number of masts and by sailing rig.

Single-masted sailing vessels include the catboat, cutter and sloop. Two-masted vessels include the bilander, brig, brigantine, ketch, schooner, snow, and yawl. Three-masted vessels include the barque, barquentine, polacre and full-rigged ship. Luggers could have one or two masts and schooners could have two or more masts.

=== Square-rigged masts ===

A three-masted vessel has, from front to back, a foremast, mainmast and mizzenmast. A two-masted vessel has a mainmast, the other being a foremast or mizzen. Ships with more than three masts may simply number them or use another scheme, as with the five-masted Preussen.

On a square-sailed vessel, the sails of each mast are named by the mast and position on the mast. For instance, on the mainmast (from bottom to top): 
* main course
* main topsail
* main topgallant (&quot;t&#x27;gallant&quot;)
* main royal
* main skysail
* main moonraker. 

On many ships, sails above the top (a platform just above the lowest sail on the fore, main and mizzens masts) were mounted on separate mast segments—&quot;topmasts&quot; or &quot;topgallant masts&quot;—held in wooden sockets called &quot;trestletrees&quot;. These masts and their stays could be rigged or struck as the weather conditions required, or for maintenance and repair.

In light breezes, the working square sails would be supplemented by &quot;studding sails&quot; (&quot;stuns&#x27;l&quot;) out on the ends of the yardarms. These were called as a regular sail, with the addition of &quot;studding&quot;. For example, the &quot;main top studding sail&quot;.

Between the main mast and mizzen as well as between main mast and foremast, the staysails between the masts are named from the sail immediately &quot;below&quot; the highest attachment point of the stay holding up that staysail. Thus, the mizzen topgallant staysail can be found dangling from the stay leading from &quot;above&quot; the &quot;mizzen&quot; (third) mast&#x27;s &quot;topgallant&quot; sail (i.e., from the mizzen topgallant yard) to at least one and usually two sails down from that on the &quot;main&quot; mast (the slope of the top edge of all staysail lines runs from a higher point nearer the stern to a lower point towards the bow).

The jibs (the staysails between the foremast and the bowsprit) are named (from inner to outer most) fore topmast staysail (or foretop stay), inner jib, outer jib and flying jib. Many of the jibs&#x27; stays meet the foremast just above the fore topgallant. A fore royal staysail may also be set.

== Austronesian and East Asian vessels ==

Austronesian rigs include what are generally called crab claw (also misleadingly called the &quot;oceanic lateen&quot; or the &quot;oceanic sprit&quot;) and tanja rigs. They were used for double-canoe (catamaran), single-outrigger (on the windward side), or double-outrigger boat configurations, in addition to monohulls. These rigs were independently developed by the Austronesian peoples during the Neolithic, beginning with the crab claw sail at around 1500 BCE. They are used throughout the range of the Austronesian Expansion, from Maritime Southeast Asia, to Micronesia, Island Melanesia, Polynesia, and Madagascar. 

=== Crab claw===
There are several distinct types of crab claw rigs, but unlike western rigs, they do not have fixed conventional names. Crab claw sails are rigged fore-and-aft and can be tilted and rotated relative to the wind. They evolved from V-shaped perpendicular square sails in which the two spars converge at the base of the hull. The simplest form of the crab claw sail (also with the widest distribution) is composed of a triangular sail supported by two light spars (sometimes erroneously called &quot;sprits&quot;) on each side. They were originally mastless, and the entire assembly was taken down when the sails were lowered.

The need to propel larger and more heavily laden boats led to the increase in vertical sail. However this introduced more instability to the vessels. In addition to the unique invention of outriggers to solve this, the sails were also leaned backwards and the converging point moved further forward on the hull. This new configuration required a loose &quot;prop&quot; in the middle of the hull to hold the spars up, as well as rope supports on the windward side. This allowed more sail area (and thus more power) while keeping the center of effort low and thus making the boats more stable. The prop was later converted into fixed or removable canted masts where the spars of the sails were actually suspended by a halyard from the masthead. This type of sail is most refined in Micronesian proas which could reach very high speeds. These configurations are sometimes known as the &quot;crane sprit&quot; or the &quot;crane spritsail&quot;.

Another evolution of the basic crab claw sail is the conversion of the upper spar into a fixed mast. In Polynesia, this gave the sail more height while also making it narrower, giving it a shape reminiscent of crab pincers (hence &quot;crab claw&quot; sail). This was also usually accompanied by the lower spar becoming more curved.

Micronesian, Island Melanesian, and Polynesian single-outrigger vessels also used the canted mast configuration to uniquely develop shunting. In shunting vessels, both ends are alike, and the boat is sailed in either direction, but it has a fixed leeward side and a windward side. The boat is shunted from beam reach to beam reach to change direction, with the wind over the side, a low-force procedure. The bottom corner of the crab claw sail is moved to the other end, which becomes the bow as the boat sets off back the way it came. The mast usually hinges, adjusting the rake or angle of the mast. The crab claw configuration used on these vessels is a low-stress rig, which can be built with simple tools and low-tech materials, but it is extremely fast. On a beam reach, it may be the fastest simple rig.

===Tanja===

The conversion of the prop to a fixed mast in the crab claw sail led to the much later invention of the tanja sail (also known variously and misleadingly as the canted square sail, canted rectangular sail, boomed lugsail, or balance lugsail). Tanja sails were rigged similarly to crab claw sails and also had spars on both the head and the foot of the sails; but they were square or rectangular with the spars not converging into a point. They are generally mounted on one or two (rarely three or more) bipod or tripod masts, usually made from thick bamboo. The masts have curved heads with grooves for attaching the halyards. The lower part of two of the bamboo poles of the mast assembly have holes that are fitted unto the ends of a cross-wise length of timber on the deck, functioning like a hinge. The forward part of the mast assembly had a forelock. By unlocking it, the mast can be lowered across the ship.

Despite the similarity of its appearance to western square rigs, the tanja is a fore-and-aft rig similar to a lugsail. The sail was suspended from the upper spar (&quot;yard&quot;), while the lower spar functioned like a boom. When set fore-and-aft, the spars extend forward of the mast by about a third of their lengths. When running before the wind, they are set perpendicular to the hull, similar to a square rig. The sail can be rotated around the mast (lessening the need for steering with the rudders) and tilted to move the center of pull forward or aft. The sail can even be tilted completely horizontally, becoming wing-like, to lift the bow above incoming waves. The sail is reefed by rolling it around the lower spar.

In addition to the tanja sails, ships with the tanja rigs also have bowsprits set with a quadrilateral headsail, sometimes also canted as depicted in the Borobudur ships. In the colonial era, these were replaced by triangular western-style jibs (often several in later periods), and the tanja sails themselves were slowly replaced with western rigs like gaff rigs.

===Junk===
The oldest undisputed depiction of the junk rig is from the Bayon temple () of Angkor Thom, Cambodia, which shows a ship with a keel and a sternpost and identifies it as Southeast Asian. Historians Paul Johnstone and Joseph Needham suggest an Austronesian (specifically Indonesian) origin of the rig. Junk rigs were adopted by the Chinese by around the 12th century. Iconographic remains show that Chinese ships before the 12th century used square sails. It also further diffused into other East Asian shipbuilding traditions, notably Japan. 

In its most traditional form the junk rig is carried on an unstayed mast (i.e. a mast without shrouds or stays, supported only on the step at the keelson and the partners); however, standing rigging of some kind is not uncommon. It is typical to run the halyards (lines used to raise and lower the sail) and sheets (lines used to trim the sail) to the companionway on a junk-rigged boat. This means that typical sailhandling can be performed from the relative safety of the cockpit, or even while the crew is below deck.

Junk sails are typically carried on a mast which rakes (slants) forward a few degrees from vertical. This causes the sail to swing outwards, absent wind pushing it, which makes the use of a preventer (a line to keep the sail extended) unnecessary.

==South Asian and Middle Eastern vessels==

===Dhow===
Unlike European ships, South Asian and Middle Eastern vessels are not named based on the type of rigging, but are named based on hull shapes. All of them are rigged similarly, and thus most of these vessels are classified as dhows in European terminology. Dhows are believed to have originated from India. They have loose-footed quadrilateral settee sails (sometimes also fully triangular lateen sails). The sails could not be reefed, instead two main sails were usually carried by the ship, one for night and bad weather, and another for daytime and fair weather. The yard was usually very long in comparison to the actual length of the boat, and they are sometimes made of two pieces of timber joined by a strengthening piece. The halyard was threaded into two holes on the yard to prevent it slipping along the length. The mast was slotted into a mast step fitted over the deck.

<doc id="83110" wikidata="Q7801388" url="?curid=83110" title="Tiger Beat">
<text>Tiger Beat was an American teen fan magazine published by The Laufer Company and marketed primarily to adolescent girls. The magazine had a paper edition that was sold at stores until December 2018, and afterward was published exclusively online until 2021.

==History and profile==
&quot;Tiger Beat&quot; was founded in September 1965 by Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Laufer, his brother Ira Laufer, and television producer and host Lloyd Thaxton. The magazine featured teen idol gossip and carried articles on movies, music and fashion. Charles Laufer described the magazine&#x27;s content as &quot;guys in their 20s singing &#x27;La La&#x27; songs to 13-year-old girls.&quot;

A distinctive element of &quot;Tiger Beat&quot; was its covers, which featured cut-and-paste collaged photos – primarily head shots – of current teen idols. For the first twelve issues, Thaxton&#x27;s face appeared at the top corner of the cover (at first the magazine was titled &quot;Lloyd Thaxton&#x27;s Tiger Beat&quot;), and he also contributed a column. After 2016, the magazine cover featured a single image of a celebrity.

During the 1960s, The Laufer Company leveraged the teen market dominated by &quot;Tiger Beat&quot; with similar magazines, including &quot;FaVE&quot; and &quot;Monkee Spectacular.&quot; In 1998, &quot;Tiger Beat&quot; was sold by publisher Sterling/MacFadden to Primedia, which in 2003 sold the magazine to Scott Laufer, the son of magazine founder Charles Laufer. Until 2014, Laufer also produced the similar teen magazine &quot;Bop&quot;. After 2015, &quot;Tiger Beat&quot; was published by Los Angeles–based Tiger Beat Media, Inc.

==In popular culture==
Jude Doyle founded the blog Tiger Beatdown (a punning reference to &quot;Tiger Beat&quot;) in 2008. It concluded in 2013.

<doc id="83111" wikidata="Q4355416" url="?curid=83111" title="Fibber McGee and Molly">
<text>Fibber McGee and Molly (1935–1959) was a longtime American husband-and-wife team radio comedy program.

The situation comedy was a staple of the NBC Red Network from 1936 on, after originating on NBC Blue in 1935. One of the most popular and enduring radio series of its time, it ran as a stand-alone series from 1935 to 1956, and then continued as a short-form series as part of the weekend &quot;Monitor&quot; from 1957 to 1959. The title characters were created and portrayed by Jim and Marian Jordan, a husband-and-wife team that had been working in radio since the 1920s.

&quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; followed up the Jordans&#x27; previous radio sitcom &quot;Smackout&quot;. It featured the misadventures of a working-class couple: habitual storyteller Fibber McGee and his sometimes terse but always loving wife Molly, living among their numerous neighbors and acquaintances in the community of Wistful Vista. As with radio comedies of the era, &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; featured an announcer, house band and vocal quartet for interludes. At the peak of the show&#x27;s success in the 1940s, it was adapted into a string of feature films. A 1959 attempt to adapt the series to television with a different cast and new writers was both a critical and commercial failure, which, coupled with Marian Jordan&#x27;s death shortly thereafter, brought the series to a finish.

==Husband and wife in real life==
The stars of the program were husband-and-wife team Jim Jordan (1896–1988) and Marian Driscoll Jordan (1898–1961), who were natives of Peoria, Illinois.

Jordan was the seventh of eight children born to James Edward Jordan, a farmer, and Mary (née Tighe) Jordan, while Driscoll was the twelfth of thirteen children born to Daniel P., a coalminer, and wife Anna (née Carroll) Driscoll.

Jim wanted to be a singer, and Marian wanted to be a music teacher. Both attended the same Catholic church, where they met at choir practice. Marian&#x27;s parents had attempted to discourage her professional aspirations. When she started seeing Jim Jordan, the Driscolls were far from approving of either him or his ideas. Jim&#x27;s voice teacher gave him a recommendation for work as a professional in Chicago, and he followed it. He was able to gain steady employment, but soon tired of the life on the road. In less than a year, Jim came back to Peoria and went to work for the Post Office. Marian&#x27;s parents now found Jim (and his career) to be acceptable, and they stopped objecting to the couple&#x27;s marriage plans. The pair married in Peoria, August 31, 1918.

Five days after the wedding, Jim received his draft notice. He was sent to France, and became part of a military touring group which entertained the armed forces after World War I. When Jim came home from France, he and Marian decided to try their luck with a vaudeville act. They had 2 children, Kathryn Therese Jordan (1920–2007) and James Carroll Jordan (1923–1998). Marian returned home for the birth of Kathryn, but went back to performing with Jim, leaving her with Jim&#x27;s parents. After Jim Jr. was born, Marian stayed with the children for a time, while Jim performed a solo act. Marian and the children joined him on the road for a short time, but the couple had to admit defeat when they found themselves in Lincoln, Illinois in 1923 with 2 small children and no funds. The couple&#x27;s parents had to wire them money for their return to Peoria. Jim went to work at a local department store, but still felt an attraction of being in show business. He and Marian went back into vaudeville.

While staying with Jim&#x27;s brother in Chicago in 1924, the family was listening to the radio; Jim said he and Marian could do better than the musical act currently on the air. Jim&#x27;s brother bet him $10 (equal to $ today) they could not. To win the bet, Jim and Marian went to WIBO, where they were immediately put on the air. At the end of the performance, the station offered the couple a contract for a weekly show, which paid $10 a week. The show&#x27;s sponsor was Oh Henry! candy, and they appeared for 6 months on &quot;The Oh Henry! Twins&quot; program, switching to radio station WENR by 1927.

When it seemed to the couple they were financially succeeding, they built a home in Chicago, which was a replica of their rented home, complete to building it on the lot next door. For their 1939 move to the West Coast, the Jordans selected an inconspicuous home in Encino. Some of Jim Jordan&#x27;s investments included the bottling company for Hires Root Beer in Kansas City.

==From vaudeville to &quot;Smackout&quot;==

&quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; originated when the small-time husband-and-wife vaudevillians began their third year as Chicago-area radio performers. Two of the shows they did for station WENR beginning in 1927, both written by Harry Lawrence, bore traces of what was to come and rank as one of the earliest forms of situation comedy. In their &quot;Luke and Mirandy&quot; farm-report program, Jim played a farmer who was given to tall tales and face-saving lies for comic effect. In a weekly comedy, &quot;The Smith Family&quot;, Marian&#x27;s character was an Irish wife of an American police officer. These characterizations, plus the Jordans&#x27; change from being singers/musicians to comic actors, pointed toward their future; it was at this time when Marian developed and perfected the radio character &quot;Teeny&quot;. It was also at WENR where the Jordans met Donald Quinn, a cartoonist who was then working in radio, and the couple hired him as their writer in 1931. They regarded Quinn&#x27;s contribution as important and included him as a full partner; the salary for &quot;Smackout&quot; and &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; was split between the Jordans and Quinn.

While working on the WENR farm report, Jim Jordan heard a true story about a shopkeeper from Missouri whose store was brimming with stock, yet he claimed to be &quot;smack out&quot; of whatever a customer would ask him for, though he always had tall tales in stock. The story reached the halls of nearby Columbia College, and the students began visiting the store, which they called &quot;Smackout&quot;, to hear the owner&#x27;s incredible stories.

For station WMAQ in Chicago, beginning in April 1931, the trio created &quot;Smackout&quot;, a 15-minute daily program that centered on a general store and its proprietor, Luke Grey (Jim Jordan), a storekeeper with a penchant for tall tales and a perpetual dearth of whatever his customers wanted: He always seemed &quot;smack out of it&quot;. Marian Jordan portrayed both a lady named Marian and a little girl named Teeny, as well as accompanying the program on piano. During the show&#x27;s run, Marian Jordan voiced a total of 69 different characters. &quot;Smackout&quot; was picked up by NBC in April 1933 and broadcast nationally until August 1935.

One of the S. C. Johnson company&#x27;s owners, Henrietta Johnson Lewis, recommended that her husband, John, Johnson Wax&#x27;s advertising manager, try the show out on a national network. The terms of the agreement between S.C. Johnson and the Jordans awarded the company ownership of the names &quot;Fibber McGee&quot; and &quot;Molly&quot;.

==From &quot;Smackout&quot; to Wistful Vista==

If &quot;Smackout&quot; proved the Jordan-Quinn union&#x27;s viability, their next creation proved their most enduring. Amplifying Luke Grey&#x27;s tall talesmanship to Midwestern braggadocio, Quinn developed &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; with Jim as the foible-prone Fibber and Marian playing his patient, common sense, honey-natured wife. In its earliest incarnation, &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; put focus on Fibber&#x27;s tall tales and extended monologues. During these earliest episodes of the series, Molly had a pronounced Irish dialect. while Fibber&#x27;s voice was somewhat higher and more cartoonish; both of the Jordans eventually switched to more realistic, Americanized dialects closer to their own natural tones over the course of the late 1930s as the series evolved into the more familiar domestic sitcom format. The show premiered on NBC April 16, 1935, and though it took three seasons to become an irrevocable hit, it became the country&#x27;s top-rated radio series. In 1935, Jim Jordan won the Burlington Liars&#x27; Club championship with a story about catching an elusive rat.

Existing in a kind of Neverland where money never came in, schemes never stayed out for very long, yet no one living or visiting went wanting, 79 Wistful Vista (the McGees&#x27; address from show No. 20, August 1935 onward) became the home Depression-exhausted Americans visited to remind themselves that they were not the only ones finding cheer in the middle of struggle and doing their best not to make it overt. The McGees won their house in a raffle from Mr. Hagglemeyer&#x27;s Wistful Vista Development Company, with lottery ticket #131,313, happened upon by chance while on a pleasure drive in their car. With blowhard McGee wavering between mundane tasks and hare-brained schemes (like digging an oil well in the back yard), antagonizing as many people as possible, and patient Molly indulging his foibles and providing loving support, not to mention a tireless parade of neighbors and friends in and out of the quiet home, &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; built its audience steadily, but once it found the full volume of that audience in 1940, they rarely let go of it.

Marian Jordan took a protracted absence from the show from November 1937 to April 1939 to deal with a lifelong battle with alcoholism, although this was attributed to &quot;fatigue&quot; in public statements at the time. The show was retitled Fibber McGee and Company during this interregnum, with scripts cleverly working around Molly&#x27;s absence (Fibber making a speech at a convention, etc.). Comedian ZaSu Pitts appeared on the &quot;Fibber McGee and Company&quot; show, as did singer Donald Novis.

While his wife was ill, Jim Jordan had been closing his radio shows by saying &quot;Goodnight, Molly.&quot; In early 1938, the Federal Communications Commission ordered him to stop, claiming it violated a rule about using public airwaves for personal communications. After a few weeks&#x27; deliberation, the Commission found that no regulations had been broken, because Molly was a fictional character. Jordan then resumed using the &quot;Goodnight, Molly&quot; signoff. In January 1939, the show moved from NBC Chicago to the new West Coast Radio City in Hollywood.

==Cast and characters==

&quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; was one of the earliest radio comedies to use an ensemble cast of regular characters played by actors other than the leads, nearly all of whom had recurring phrases and running gags, in addition to numerous other peripheral characters unheard from over the course of the series.

===Main===
* Fibber McGee (Jim Jordan) – a habitual storyteller and the central figure of the series. Originally portrayed with a cartoonish accent, the character settled into using Jordan&#x27;s own natural voice by the early 1940s.
* Molly McGee (Marian Jordan) – Fibber&#x27;s Irish wife and the straight woman of the double act. Her traditional putdown, &quot;&#x27;Tain&#x27;t funny McGee!&quot;, appears in the very first episode.

===Recurring===
* Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve (Harold Peary) – the pompous next-door neighbor with whom Fibber enjoyed twitting and arguing. Introduced in 1939. Gildersleeve went through several incarnations and first names, all voiced by Peary, before settling on Throckmorton. Many of his interactions with Fibber include the catchphrase &quot;You&#x27;re a hard man, McGee&quot;, in response to a harsh or critical statement from Fibber. Throckmortons&#x27;s wife is frequently mentioned, never heard, and dropped when Peary moved on to his own show. However, the wife of Homer Gildersleeve (again played by Peary) was briefly heard from in one episode.
* The Old-Timer (Bill Thompson) – a hard-of-hearing senior citizen with a penchant for distorting jokes, prefacing each one by saying, &quot;That ain&#x27;t the way I heer&#x27;d it!&quot; For no apparent reason, he refers to Fibber as &quot;Johnny&quot; and Molly as &quot;Daughter&quot;. A recurring joke is that he refuses to tell his real name; he uses various aliases before his real name, Adleton P. Bagshaw, is revealed in one of the 15-minute episodes near the end of the series. The Old-Timer&#x27;s girlfriend is named Bessie, and she usually refers to him as &quot;O.T.&quot; In the December 10, 1940 episode &quot;Mailing Christmas Packages&quot;, his sister refers to him as &quot;Roy&quot;.
* Tini, also known as &quot;Little Girl&quot; and &quot;Sis&quot; (Marian Jordan) – a precocious youngster who frequently tried to cadge loose change from Fibber (often in cahoots with her rarely heard best friend Willie Toops). She often ended her sentences with &quot;I betcha!&quot;, and when someone mentioned food, or a word that sounded like a food, she usually responded &quot;I&#x27;m hungry.&quot; Tini was also known to lose track of her own conversations. When Fibber showed interest in what she was saying, she would forget all about it, and her conversation would switch from telling to asking. After Fibber repeated everything she had been telling him, Tini would reply &quot;I know!&quot; or &quot;I know it!&quot; in a condescending way. Her appearances were sometimes foreshadowed by Molly excusing herself to the kitchen or to have a nap. Fibber would wistfully deliver a compliment to her, saying, &quot;Ah, there goes a good kid&quot;, upon which the doorbell would ring and Tini would appear, usually greeting Fibber with &quot;Hi, mister!&quot; On rare occasions Molly and Tini would interact. During the 1944 season&#x27;s episode titled &quot;Aunt Sarah&#x27;s Picture&quot;, Fibber asks Tini what her real name is. Tini responded, &quot;When I was a little baby my daddy called me Martini and then they just started calling me Tini I guess&quot;. Fibber responds, &quot;Why did your daddy call you Martini when you were a baby?&quot;, to which Tini replied, &quot;He said I was never dry enough to suit him&quot;. In the December 21, 1948 broadcast Fibber learns that her real name is &quot;Elizabeth&quot; from a Christmas card she had sent him, and in the episode &quot;Fibber Gets Stuck In Fresh Pavement&quot;, she reveals her last name is Whiticomb. She was perpetually a child, and her permanent youth was only mentioned once; Fibber asked her how old she was, to which she responded, &quot;six&quot;. Then he asked how long she had been coming over to visit him and Molly. &quot;Nine years&quot;, she answered. Then, after a pause, she asked, &quot;Ain&#x27;t it a wonderful world, mister?&quot;
* Mayor Homer La Trivia (Gale Gordon) – the mayor of Wistful Vista, whose name was inspired by New York City&#x27;s famous mayor Fiorello La Guardia. In later episodes, Fibber occasionally addresses the mayor as &quot;Homer&quot; and in one episode, we learn that Fifi Tremaine&#x27;s pet name for the mayor is &quot;Chuckie&quot;. The McGees&#x27; regular routine with La Trivia entailed Fibber and Molly misunderstanding a figure of speech, in much the same vein as Abbott &amp; Costello&#x27;s &quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot; routine. La Trivia would slowly progress from attempting patient explanation to tongue-tied rage, in Gale Gordon&#x27;s classic slow-burn. Occasionally, after La Trivia exited a scene, Fibber and Molly&#x27;s dialogue makes it clear that they were deliberately winding him up.
* Foggy Williams (Gordon) – local weatherman and next-door neighbor who tells fanciful stories, lets Fibber borrow his tools, and takes credit or blame for the present weather conditions. He is known for his extensive use of tentative language and usually exits with the line &quot;Good day... probably.&quot;
* Dr. George Gamble (Arthur Q. Bryan) – a local physician and surgeon with whom Fibber had a long-standing rivalry and friendship. The two often come up with creative insults for each other&#x27;s excessive weight. Before Bryan joined the cast, Gale Gordon played the part of the town doctor in several episodes.
* Ole Swenson (Richard LeGrand, who also played Mr. Peavey on &quot;The Great Gildersleeve&quot;) – a Swedish-born janitor at the Elks Club, often complaining that he was &quot;joost donatin&#x27; my time!&quot; His wife&#x27;s name is Helga, and their children include Kristina, Sven, Lars, and Ole.
* Mrs. Abigail Uppington (Isabel Randolph) – a snooty society matron whose pretensions Fibber delighted in deflating. Fibber often addressed her as &quot;Uppy&quot;. In the episode &quot;Fibber Hires A Surveyor&quot; (March 26, 1940) it is revealed that she is having a romantic relationship with orchestra leader Billy Mills, and in the episode &quot;Gildersleeve&#x27;s Diary&quot; (October 22, 1940), we learn that she also has a romantic past with Gildersleeve. She also has a relationship with Horatio K. Boomer in a few episodes, and the McGees assume he is using her for her money. In several episodes, there are references to the fact that Mrs. Uppington wasn&#x27;t always rich. In the episode &quot;The Circus Comes to Town&quot; (May 28, 1940), it is revealed that she met the wealthy Mr. Uppington when she was a circus bareback rider known as Mademoiselle Tootsie Latour. Her horse got scared during a trick, and she accidentally did a double back flip into Mr. Uppington&#x27;s lap, and he proposed on the spot.
* Mrs. Millicent Carstairs (Bea Benaderet) – another of Wistful Vista&#x27;s high society matrons, known to Fibber as &quot;Carsty&quot;. Like Mrs. Uppington, Mrs. Carstairs doesn&#x27;t come from a wealthy lineage. In &quot;Fibber Thinks He&#x27;s the Governor&#x27;s Pal&quot; (December 11, 1945), she lets slip that before she met Mr. Carstairs she was a blackjack dealer in a gambling joint.
* Wallace Wimple (Thompson) – Wimple was a soft-spoken man in the Caspar Milquetoast vein. He would enter the episode uttering his mush-mouth catchphrase, &quot;Hello, folks!&quot; Wimple might recite a verse he&#x27;d written but more often would recount the latest incident in his ongoing battle with the unheard Sweetie-Face, his massive and abusive &quot;big old wife&quot;. &quot;Wimp&quot;, as Fibber called him, often reported provoking an overreaction from Sweetie-Face, followed by his attempt at revenge in a way that could be prankish, painful, or in some stories potentially fatal. One day (March 9, 1948) when he asked Sweetie-Face what she was doing, Wallace said she told him she was &quot;practicing her weight-lifting&quot;. Wallace said he told Sweetie-Face, &quot;My goodness, you do that every time you get up out of a chair.&quot; “Uh oh,&quot; fretted Molly. &quot;And then when I regained consciousness,&quot; continued Wimple, &quot;she&#x27;d left the room.&quot; With a typically evil chuckle, Wallace said that he got even by bolting her 200-pound barbell to the floor, causing her to strain so hard the next time she lifted weights that she popped her girdle. Though the term &quot;wimp&quot; as used to describe a weak-willed person predated &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot;, the Wimple character and Fibber&#x27;s nickname for him may have contributed to a surge in popular use. Mr. Wimple had originated on &quot;Don McNeill&#x27;s Breakfast Club&quot; in 1934 before he joined the &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; cast and would later use the voice and some of his deceptively devious mannerisms for the cartoon character Droopy.
* Alice Darling (Shirley Mitchell) – a ditzy and boy-crazy young aircraft-plant worker who boarded with the McGees during the war.
* Horatio K. Boomer (Thompson) – a con artist with a W. C. Fields-like voice and delivery. His appearances typically included him rummaging through a pocket or bag or other container and listing the things inside, usually ending with &quot;a check for a short beer&quot;.
* Nick Depopulis (Thompson) – a Greek-born restaurateur with a tendency toward verbal malapropisms. He normally refers to Fibber and Molly as &quot;Fizzer and Kewpie&quot;.
* Milt Spilkt – the nephew of Kramer from Kramer&#x27;s Drugstore.
* The Toops Family – Mort and Mabel Toops, and their son Willie, live in the McGees&#x27; neighborhood next door to Dr. Gamble. They are rarely heard on the show, but have occasional lines (for example, Mabel has several lines during &quot;Fibber Cooks Dinner for Molly&#x27;s Birthday&quot; (October 23, 1951), Mort has some lines in &quot;Halloween Party&quot; (October 28, 1935), and Willie is heard in &quot;Soapbox Derby Racer for Teeny&quot; (April 24, 1951)). Willie Toops is most often mentioned in conjunction with Teeny, who sometimes refers to him as her boyfriend or future husband. The character of Beulah first appeared when she stopped at the McGees&#x27; on her way to her first day of work at the Toops&#x27; house. Mort was a regular on the Jordans&#x27; previous series &quot;Smackout&quot;, where Jim Jordan had voiced him.
* Myrtle, also known as &quot;Myrt&quot; – an almost-never-heard-from telephone operator (she makes a brief appearance in the June 22, 1943 episode) that Fibber is friends with. A typical Myrt sketch started with Fibber picking up the phone and demanding, &quot;Operator, give me number 32Oooh, is that you, Myrt? How&#x27;s every little thing, Myrt? What say, Myrt?&quot; Commonly, this was followed with Fibber relaying what Myrt was telling him to Molly, usually news about Myrt&#x27;s family, and always ending with a bad pun. Myrtle made one brief on-air appearance on June 22, 1943, when she visited the McGees to wish them a good summer—the McGees did not recognize her in person.
* Fred Nitney – another never-heard character, until episode 715, which aired January 6, 1953. They meet and chat briefly at the train station. Fibber&#x27;s old vaudeville partner from Starved Rock, Illinois.
* Aunt Sarah – Molly&#x27;s rich aunt who always sends useless gifts for Christmas, a silent character.
* Fifi Tremaine – another never-heard-from character, Fifi was an actress and was courted by both Doc Gamble and Mayor La Trivia, and Fibber enjoyed pitting the two against each other in their competition for Fifi&#x27;s affections.
* Herbert Appel – a stock boy at the hardware store, his character is distinguished by his odd speech patterns. By putting non-standard emphasis on syllables and sounds, his sentences can be confusing and/or humorous (what would now be considered mondegreen). For example, &quot;I had to get up at eight o&#x27;clock&quot; is heard by Fibber and Molly as &quot;I had to get a potato clock&quot;, &quot;I got up too early&quot; comes out as &quot;I got up twirly&quot;, and his own name sounds like &quot;Herber Tapple&quot; (in &quot;Fibber Puts Up Christmas Lights&quot;, December 20, 1949).
* Beulah – the McGees&#x27; black maid and possibly the series&#x27; most unusual character. Unlike the situation on &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;, where black actor Eddie Anderson played &quot;Rochester&quot;, Beulah was voiced by a white male, Marlin Hurt. The character&#x27;s usual opening line, &quot;Somebody bawl fo&#x27; Beulah??&quot;, often provoked a stunned, screeching sort of laughter among the live studio audience; many of them, seeing the show performed for the first time in person, did not know that the actor voicing Beulah was neither black nor female, and expressed their surprise when Hurt delivered his line. Her other catchphrase, typically delivered after a fit of laughter over a Fibber gag, was, &quot;Love that man!&quot; Hurt had created the Beulah character independently and had portrayed her occasionally on other shows prior to his joining the &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; cast.
* Lena – the McGees&#x27; second maid during the series, she replaced Beulah after the character was spun off into her own show. Like Beulah, Lena was played by male actor Gene Carroll.
* Uncle Dennis (Ransom Sherman) – Molly&#x27;s hard-drinking uncle, Dennis Driscoll, who was the subject of a running gag (see below) and was generally never heard. He did appear in a few episodes in 1943–44, including &quot;Renting Spare Room&quot; (October 5, 1943), &quot;Fibber Makes His Own Chili Sauce&quot; (November 9, 1943), and &quot;Dinner Out to Celebrate&quot; (January 25, 1944).
* Sigmund &quot;Sig&quot; Wellington (Sherman) – the manager of the Bijou Theater

===As themselves===
* Billy Mills – wisecracking leader of &quot;Billy Mills and the Orchestra&quot;, who led the show&#x27;s ensemble through musical numbers in each episode. In addition to standards and popular tunes, Mills occasionally showcased his own original compositions, including &quot;I&#x27;m in Love with the Sound Effects Man&quot; (in the episode &quot;Amusement Park&quot; (June 17, 1941) and later covered by Spike Jones), and &quot;The Cocky Cuckoo&quot; (in the episode &quot;Businessmen&#x27;s Symphony&quot;, (06/12/51)). Mills also was the composer of the show&#x27;s theme song, &quot;Wing to Wing&quot;, that was used from 1940 until the series&#x27; end.
* Rico Marcelli – the original bandleader prior to Mills&#x27;s arrival. Unlike Mills, Marcelli had no non-musical role in the series.
* Harlow Wilcox – announcer for the series, whom Fibber regularly interrupts during commercial breaks.

==After the program aired and rehearsal==
The radio show was run on a tight schedule, considered to be one of the best organized broadcasts on the networks. Perhaps because or despite his having a good memory, Jim Jordan insisted that everyone affiliated with the program must take a two-day rest, following the Tuesday broadcast. Nothing was done about the following Tuesday&#x27;s show until Friday morning, when Jim and Marian Jordan got together with writer Don Quinn and agency producer Cecil Underwood to talk through the following weeks&#x27; script. They worked in a business office because they were convinced a businesslike and efficient atmosphere helped them get the work done in 2 hours. By Saturday morning, Quinn had the first draft of the script ready, which &quot;Fibber&quot; read, and then Quinn revised into the final, working script. He did this Sunday night, working all night and finishing Monday morning, when the cast would gather at NBC&#x27;s Hollywood studios, and rehearse for 2 hours. After this, Quinn made any final changes. Tuesday morning the entire cast (including Billy Mills&#x27; orchestra) would run through the script about 4 times, ending with a complete run-through at 3 pm. At 5:30 p.m. (Pacific time), the show went on the air. This pattern of preparation never varied by much more than an hour from week-to-week.
==Show format==
 For most of the show&#x27;s history, the usual order of the show was the introduction followed by a Johnson Wax plug by Harlow then his introduction to the first part of the script (usually 11 minutes). Billy Mills usually followed with an instrumental (or accompanied by Martha Tilton in 1941). The musical interlude would segue into the second part of the script, followed by a performance (by the vocal group, the Kings Men – occasionally featuring a solo by leader Ken Darby). The final act would then begin, with the last line usually being the lesson learned that day. A final commercial, then Billy Mills&#x27; theme song to fade. Later, Harlow would meet up and visit with the McGees, and work in a Johnson Wax commercial, sometimes assisted by Fibber and Molly.

==Ratings==
==Running gags==

Much of the show&#x27;s humor relied on recurring gags, unseen regulars and well-timed punch lines. The 30-minute show usually opened with the audience in full laughter as announcer Harlow Wilcox called out &quot;The Johnson Wax Program with Fibber McGee and Molly!&quot; To McGee&#x27;s periodic bad jokes Molly often answered &quot;T&#x27;ain&#x27;t funny, McGee!&quot;, which became a familiar catchphrase during the 1940s. Molly&#x27;s Uncle Dennis, who lives with the couple, is apparently a dedicated alcoholic and a punch line for many Fibber jokes; at times he was the main subject of some shows in which he &quot;disappeared&quot;.

That Fibber lacked a regular job led to numerous references and jokes: Mayor La Trivia often offered McGee mundane jobs at City Hall using flowery descriptions such as &quot;looking in on the higher-ups at City Hall&quot; (a window-cleaning job). Another was for Fibber to work in disguise for days at a time as the Wistful Vista Santa Claus.

&quot;Fibber&quot; McGee is overly proud of past misdeeds, sometimes recalling nicknames acquired; many involved a bad pun. An accusation of being a glib talker became &quot;Ad Glib McGee&quot;. And making expressions with his eyes led to the nickname &quot;Eyes-a-muggin&#x27; McGee&quot; (a play on the popular Stuff Smith swing tune &quot;I&#x27;se A-muggin). The opening involved much boastful alliteration.

The couple&#x27;s Peoria schoolmate (and Molly&#x27;s earlier boyfriend) Otis Cadwallader is the subject of a longstanding one-sided grudge by Fibber. The &quot;corner of 14th and Oak&quot; in downtown Wistful Vista was routinely given as a location for various homes, places of business and government buildings throughout the show&#x27;s run. Whenever someone asks the time it is always half-past.

McGee has a reputation for telling tall tales, and there are occasional jokes linking this propensity to his name &quot;Fibber&quot;. In the episode &quot;Fibber Changes His Name&quot; (March 25, 1941), he goes so far as to claim that &quot;Fibber&quot; is his actual given name and not just a nickname. According to McGee, &quot;I was named after my fourth cousin, Walpole J. Fimmer ... but the minister who christened me had a cold in his head.&quot;

===The Hall Closet===

None of the show&#x27;s other running gags was as memorable or enduring as the overstuffed hall closet. The gag involved McGee&#x27;s frequently opening a cacophonous closet, with the bric-a-brac it contained clattering down and out and, often enough, over McGee&#x27;s or Molly&#x27;s heads. &quot;I gotta get that closet cleaned out one of these days&quot; was the usual McGee observation once the racket subsided. Naturally, &quot;one of these days&quot; almost never arrived. A good thing, too: in one famous instance, when a burglar (played by Bob Bruce) tied up McGee, McGee informed him cannily that the family&#x27;s silver was &quot;right through that door, bud... just yank it open, bud!&quot; Naturally, the burglar took the bait and naturally, he was buried in the inevitable avalanche, long enough for the police to apprehend him.

This gag appears to have begun with the March 5, 1940, show, &quot;Cleaning the Closet&quot;. Molly opens the closet looking for the dictionary and is promptly buried in Fibber&#x27;s &quot;stuff&quot; (&quot;arranged in there just the way I want it&quot;). Cleaning out the closet becomes the show&#x27;s plot, inventorying much of the contents along the way: a photo album, a rusty horseshoe, a ten-foot pole. After repacking the closet, Fibber realizes the dictionary has been put away too—and he opens the closet again, causing an avalanche. This episode also features a cameo by Gracie Allen, running for president on the Surprise Party ticket. Toward the end of the September 30, 1941 show, &quot;Back from Vacation; Gildy Says Goodbye&quot;, next-door nemesis Gildersleeve—who has moved to Summerfield to finish raising his orphaned niece and nephew (and already begun his successful spin-off show &quot;The Great Gildersleeve&quot;)—has come back to Wistful Vista to wind up his affairs there. In a farewell to the show that made him famous, Gildersleeve opens the closet to be buried in the usual avalanche.

On at least one occasion, the gag is flipped, and the closet is silent: in &quot;Man&#x27;s Untapped Energies&quot; (broadcast March 11, 1947), visiting Dr. Gamble makes to leave. Molly warns, &quot;No, Doctor, not through that door, that&#x27;s the hall closet!&quot; As the audience chuckles slightly in anticipation, Fibber explains: &quot;Oh, I forgot to tell you, Molly, I straightened out the hall closet this morning!&quot; This was certainly not the end of the gag, though, as the closet soon became cluttered once again, leading to many more disasters.

Like many such trademarks, the clattering closet began as a one-time stunt, but &quot;the closet&quot; was developed carefully, not being overused (it rarely appeared in more than two consecutive installments, though it never disappeared for the same length, either, at the height of its identification, and it rarely collapsed at exactly the same time from show to show), and it became the best-known running sound gag in American radio&#x27;s classic period. Jack Benny&#x27;s basement vault alarm ran a distant second. Both of these classic sound effects were performed by Ed Ludes and Virgil Rhymer, the Hollywood-based NBC staff sound effects creators. Exactly &quot;what&quot; tumbled out of McGee&#x27;s closet each time was never clear (except to these sound-effects men), but what signaled the end of the avalanche was always the same sound: a clear, tiny, household hand bell and McGee&#x27;s inevitable post-collapse lament. &quot;Fibber McGee&#x27;s closet&quot; entered the American vernacular as a catchphrase synonymous with household clutter.

==Sponsors==
Each episode also featured an appearance by announcer Harlow Wilcox, whose job it was to weave the second ad for the sponsor into the plot without having to break the show for a real commercial. Wilcox&#x27;s introductory pitch lines were usually met with groans or humorously sarcastic lines by Fibber. During the many years that the show was sponsored by Johnson Wax, Fibber nicknamed Wilcox &quot;Waxy&quot;, due to Wilcox&#x27;s constant praises of their various products, and during the years the show was sponsored by Pet Milk, Fibber changed the nickname to &quot;Milky&quot;. In a style not unusual for the classic radio years, the show was typically introduced as, &quot;The Johnson Wax Program, with Fibber McGee and Molly&quot;. Johnson Wax sponsored the show through 1950; Pet Milk through 1952; and, until the show&#x27;s final half-hour episode in mid-1953, Reynolds Aluminum. Fibber sometimes referred to Harlow as &quot;Harpo&quot;.

The show also used two musical numbers per episode to break the comedy routines into sections. For most of the show&#x27;s run, there would be one vocal number by The King&#x27;s Men (a vocal quartet: Ken Darby, Rad Robinson, Jon Dodson and Bud Linn), and an instrumental by The Billy Mills Orchestra. For a short time in the early 1940s, Martha Tilton would sing what was formerly the instrumental.

Before and during America&#x27;s involvement in World War II, references to or about the war and the members of the Axis Powers were commonplace on the show. Just after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Jim Jordan, out of character, soberly ended the &quot;Fibber McGee&quot; show by inviting the studio audience to sing &quot;America&quot;. During the show of December 9, the Mayor is seeking a globe in order to keep up with current events. Molly asks him, &quot;Do you want one with Japan on it?&quot; The mayor says, &quot;Why, of course.&quot; &quot;Then you better get one quick,&quot; Molly says, receiving thunderous applause from the studio audience.

Also commonplace were calls to action to buy war bonds (both through announcements and subtle references written into the script), and condemnation of food and supply hoarding. On the other hand, the Jordans gladly cooperated in turning the show over to a half-hour devoted entirely to patriotic music on the day of the D-Day invasion in 1944, with the couple speaking only at the opening and the closing of the broadcast. This show remains available to collectors amidst many a &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; packaging.

When the shows were broadcast overseas by the Armed Forces Radio Service (AFRS), all three commercials were eliminated from the program. Harlow Wilcox&#x27;s middle ad was edited out, and the two advertisements at the beginning and end of the show were replaced by musical numbers, so that the show on AFRS would have two numbers by Billy Mills and the Orchestra, and two by The King&#x27;s Men.

The Jordans were experts at transforming the ethnic humor of vaudeville into more rounded comic characters, no doubt due in part to the affection felt for the famous supporting cast members who voiced these roles, including Bill Thompson (as the Old Timer and Wimple), Harold Peary (as Gildersleeve), Gale Gordon (as La Trivia), Arthur Q. Bryan (as Dr. Gamble; Bryan also voiced Elmer Fudd for the Warner Brothers Looney Tunes cartoons, which also borrowed lines from &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; from time to time), Isabel Randolph (as Mrs. Uppington), Marlin Hurt (a white male who played in dialect the McGee&#x27;s maid, Beulah), and others. They were also expert at their own running gags and catchphrases, many of which entered the American vernacular: &quot;That ain&#x27;t the way &quot;I&quot; heeard it!&quot;; &quot;&#x27;T&#x27;ain&#x27;t funny, McGee!&quot; and &quot;Heavenly days!&quot; were the three best known.

==Spin-offs==
&quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; spun two supporting characters off into their own shows. By far the most successful and popular was Harold Peary&#x27;s Gildersleeve, spun into &quot;The Great Gildersleeve&quot; in 1941. This show introduced single parenthood of a sort to creative broadcasting: the pompous, previously married Gildersleeve now moved to Summerfield, became single (although the missing wife was never explained), and raised his orphaned, spirited niece and nephew, while dividing his time between running his manufacturing business and (eventually) becoming the town water commissioner. In one episode, the McGees arrived in Summerfield for a visit with their old neighbor with hilarious results: McGee inadvertently learns Gildersleeve is engaged, and he practically needs to be chloroformed to perpetuate the secret a little longer.

Peary returned the favor in a memorable 1944 &quot;Fibber McGee &amp; Molly&quot; episode in which neither of the title characters appeared: Jim Jordan was recovering from a bout of pneumonia (this would be written into the show the following week, when the Jordans returned), and the story line involved Gildersleeve and nephew Leroy hoping to visit the McGees at home during a train layover in Wistful Vista, but finding Fibber and Molly not at home. At the end of the episode, Gildersleeve discovers the couple had left in a hurry that morning when they received &quot;Gildy&#x27;s&quot; letter saying he would be stopping over in Wistful Vista.

Marlin Hurt&#x27;s &quot;Beulah&quot; was also spun off, leading to both a radio and television show that would eventually star Hattie McDaniel and Ethel Waters.

Jim and Marian Jordan themselves occasionally appeared on other programs, away from their Fibber and Molly characters. One memorable episode of &quot;Suspense&quot; (&quot;Backseat Driver&quot;, February 3, 1949) cast the Jordans as victims of a car-jacking; Jim Jordan&#x27;s tense, interior monologues were especially dramatic.

==Films==
The Jordans portrayed their characters in four films. In the early years of the radio show, they were supporting characters in the 1937 Paramount film &quot;This Way Please&quot;, starring Charles &quot;Buddy&quot; Rogers and Betty Grable. Once the show hit its stride, they had leading roles in the RKO Radio Pictures films &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Laughing&quot; (1941), &quot;Here We Go Again&quot; (1942), and &quot;Heavenly Days&quot; (1944).

The first two RKO films are generally considered the best, as they co-star fellow radio stars Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy. Harold Peary also appears in both as Gildersleeve, with Arthur Q. Bryan, Bill Thompson, Harlow Wilcox, Gale Gordon, and Isabel Randolph appearing in both their show roles and as other characters. Bill Thompson in &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Laughing&quot; played two parts: The pushy sales-man, and the man who shouted &quot;It&#x27;s Hillary Horton&quot;. Gale Gordon played Otis Cadwalader, Molly&#x27;s ex-boyfriend in &quot;Here We Go Again&quot;. Arthur Q. Bryan played the Mayor&#x27;s aide in &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Laughing&quot;. The Jordans&#x27; participation in &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Laughing&quot; was set up in the Fibber McGee &amp; Molly episode &quot;Amusement Park&quot; (June 17, 1941), in which Gale Gordon played an RKO pictures representative who followed the McGees around the amusement park and chose the McGees as a representative American couple to star in a movie with Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy. The day before the film&#x27;s real-life premiere in San Francisco, the movie had its fictional opening in Wistful Vista during that week&#x27;s radio episode, and Bergen and McCarthy made a guest appearance (&quot;Premiere of Look Who&#x27;s Laughing&quot; (November 11, 1941)).

&quot;Look Who&#x27;s Laughing&quot; has been released on VHS and DVD as part of the &quot;Lucille Ball RKO Collection&quot;. &quot;Here We Go Again&quot; has been released on VHS and was released on DVD on January 14, 2014, through Warner Archives. &quot;Heavenly Days&quot; was also included in the January 2014 DVD release of &quot;Here We Go Again&quot; as part of a &quot;double feature&quot; DVD. &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Laughing&quot;, &quot;Here We Go Again&quot; and &quot;Heavenly Days&quot; have been featured on Turner Classic Movies.

In addition to the feature films, the McGees appeared in character in the 1945 film &quot;The All-Star Bond Rally&quot;, a promotional film for war bonds. The characters appear as bookends to the film, attending a stage presentation hosted by Bob Hope, who knows and recognizes them. &quot;The All-Star Bond Rally&quot; lapsed into the public domain in 1973 and is widely available.

Other films featured the McGees&#x27; neighbors. The first film was called &quot;Comin&#x27; Round the Mountain&quot; (1940) and featured the McGees&#x27; neighbors The Old-Timer (played by Bill Thompson) and Gildersleeve, as the mayor of the town. Gildersleeve&#x27;s character was in many other films before &quot;The Great Gildersleeve&quot; show and movies. Abigail Uppington is in the film &quot;County Fair&quot; along with Harold Peary, and his future radio show co-star Shirley Mitchell (who also played Leila Ransom in &quot;The Great Gildersleeve&quot;); the Uppington character also appeared in &quot;Barnyard Follies&quot;.

==Changes==
NBC, taking stock of its most valuable broadcast properties and anticipating the lucrative new field of television, regarded &quot; Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; as being essential to its future plans. In 1948 the network offered to buy the franchise outright from its owners: Jim Jordan, Marian Jordan, and Don Quinn. The owners agreed to the buyout, and &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; officially became the property of NBC.

The network had high hopes of converting the radio show to television. These hopes were not shared by the Jordans, who preferred to remain in radio. &quot;They were trying to push us into TV, and we were reluctant,&quot; Jim Jordan told an interviewer many years later. &quot;Our friends advised us, &#x27;Don&#x27;t do it until you need to. You have this value in radio--milk it dry.&#x27;&quot; The Jordans grudgingly agreed to film a TV pilot when their longtime sponsor S. C. Johnson requested it, but the video adaptation was abandoned. The sponsor, anxious to devote more advertising dollars to television, parted company with &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; amicably. Pet Milk took over the sponsorship of the radio show in 1950 (for two years), followed by Reynolds Aluminum, which subsidized the show until the end of the primetime run on June 30, 1953.

NBC wanted to keep its property going, so the show was retooled as a daily 15-minute show, aired Monday through Friday twice a day (afternoons and evenings). The retooling had new economies taking their toll on the original format. The studio audience was dispensed with, leaving the Jordans to record their dialogue in a quiet studio. All five of each week&#x27;s episodes were recorded in a single session. (This proved a special boon to Marian Jordan, who found the new surroundings more comfortable and convenient.) The musical sections of the half-hour format were removed, leaving a quarter-hour of continuous comedy. Although announcer Harlow Wilcox and character comedian Gale Gordon did not participate in the daily shows, Bill Thompson and Arthur Q. Bryan continued making appearances alongside the Jordans, along with familiar radio performers Virginia Gregg, Herb Vigran, Robert Easton, and Mary Jane Croft, among others. The new format began airing on October 5, 1953, and was successful; NBC Radio kept &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; in its weekday lineup through March 23, 1956.

NBC had launched an ambitious new format for its weekend programming in 1955: &quot;Monitor&quot;. This was designed especially to demonstrate the immediacy and importance of radio, with a mixture of news, sports, music, comedy, human interest, and special events running continuously throughout the weekend hours. In 1957 NBC, still valuing its &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; property, invited Jim and Marian Jordan to record new comedy routines for &quot;Monitor&quot;. These interludes, aired as &quot;Just Molly and Me&quot;, featured the Jordans (alone, with no supporting cast) in five-minute sketches written by &quot;Monitor&quot; staffer (and Bob and Ray writer) Tom Koch. Koch caught the spirit of the series beautifully, bringing back many of the familiar hallmarks of the half-hour series and cleverly fashioning new stories in five-part serial form. A 1959 strip, &quot;Autumn Drive,&quot; has Fibber and Molly planning to look at the fall foliage: episode one has the couple enthusing about the trip; episode two has McGee explaining foliage to Teeny; episode three has the McGees loading their car for any contingency; episode four has them on the road; and episode five has them reviewing the photographs they took on the tour. Radio historian Gerald S. Nachman has written that the Jordans anticipated renewing their contract with NBC for another three years when Marian&#x27;s battle against ovarian cancer ended with her death in 1961.

==Television==
After the last of the &quot;Just Molly and Me&quot; radio shorts ceased production, there were two attempts at getting the McGees onto television. Only one came to fruition. The &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; TV series began production on March 15, 1959, for broadcast beginning in September 1959. Initial press releases stated that Jim Jordan Jr. would be the director, but he became a consultant, along with the radio show&#x27;s original creator, Don Quinn. The TV version was produced by William Asher for NBC (and co-sponsored by Singer Corporation and Standard Brands). Neither of the Jordans, nor Phil Leslie (the head writer by the end of the radio series), took part in the series. The decision was made to recast both roles, with younger actors Bob Sweeney and Cathy Lewis as Fibber and Molly respectively; Lewis had previously played Jane Stacy, a very similar straight-woman character, on the radio version of &quot;My Friend Irma&quot;. Bill Davenport served as head writer for this series. The only radio alumnus to appear as a regular cast member was Harold Peary, who took the role of Mayor La Trivia.

The TV version&#x27;s main asset was character comic Bob Sweeney, who caught the spirit and cadence of Jim Jordan&#x27;s &quot;Fibber&quot; delivery, alternating between cheerful, boastful, and fretful. Veteran screen actor Addison Richards made a good foil as Doc Gamble. The series had solid comedy situations, and might have succeeded as a typical domestic comedy if the characters had been named anything &quot;but&quot; Fibber and Molly, but it could not replicate the flavor and humor of the original &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot;. The TV series did not survive its first season, ending its run in January 1960. The pilot episode and at least three episodes of the television series have lapsed into the public domain.

The second TV venture only got as far as the planning stages. NBC approached Jay Ward, producer of the &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; TV cartoons, to film a series of half-hour &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; cartoons. This was probably an attempt by NBC to reactivate its property to compete with ABC&#x27;s then-new cartoon sitcom &quot;The Flintstones&quot;. Ward declined, and NBC&#x27;s &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; franchise finally came to an end.

==Jim Jordan later in life==
In the 1970s, Jim Jordan briefly returned to acting. An episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Chico and the Man&quot; featured a surprise appearance by Jordan as a friendly neighborhood mechanic. Jordan also lent his voice to Disney&#x27;s animated film, &quot;The Rescuers&quot; (1977) and reprised his role as Fibber McGee (complete with the closet gag) in an advertisement for AARP. He died in 1988—a year before &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame.

Jim Jordan married Gretchen Stewart (the widow of Yogi Yorgesson) after Marian&#x27;s death. Gretchen and the Jordan children donated the manuscripts of &quot;Smackout&quot; and &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; to Chicago&#x27;s Museum of Broadcast Communications after his death in 1988. Perhaps fittingly for his longtime radio alter ego, Jordan died on April Fool&#x27;s Day.

The show has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame next to the NBC studios where the show was performed. The S.C. Johnson Company has preserved more than 700 shows it sponsored for fifteen years.

<text>The 1972 Summer Olympics (), officially known as the Games of the XX Olympiad () and officially branded as Munich 1972 (; ), were an international multi-sport event held in Munich, West Germany, from 26 August to 11 September 1972. It was the second Summer Olympics to be held in Germany, after the 1936 Games in Berlin, which had taken place under the Nazi rule. Germany became only the second country at that point after the United States to have two different cities host the Summer Olympics.

The West German government had been eager to have the Munich Olympics present a democratic and optimistic Germany to the world, as shown by the Games&#x27; official motto, &quot;Die Heiteren Spiele&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;DER SPIEGEL 35/1972&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;the cheerful Games&quot;. The logo of the Games was a blue solar logo (the &quot;Bright Sun&quot;) by Otl Aicher, the designer and director of the visual conception commission. The hostesses wore sky-blue dirndls as a promotion of Bavarian cultural heritage. The Olympic mascot, the dachshund &quot;Waldi&quot;, was the first officially named Olympic mascot. The Olympic Fanfare was composed by Herbert Rehbein. The Soviet Union won the most gold and overall medals.

The Olympic Park (&quot;Olympiapark&quot;) was based on Frei Otto&#x27;s plans and became a Munich landmark after the Games. The competition sites, designed by architect Günther Behnisch, included the Olympic swimming hall, the Olympics Hall (&quot;Olympiahalle&quot;, a multipurpose facility) and the Olympic Stadium (&quot;Olympiastadion&quot;), and an Olympic village very close to the park. The design of these stadia was considered revolutionary, with sweeping canopies of acrylic glass stabilized by metal ropes, used on such a large scale for the first time.

The event was overshadowed by the Munich massacre in the second week, in which 11 Israeli athletes and coaches and a West German police officer at the Olympic Village were killed by the Palestinian militant organisation Black September.

== Host city selection ==

Munich won its Olympic bid on 26 April 1966, at the 64th IOC Session in Rome, Italy, over bids presented by Detroit, Madrid, and Montréal. Montréal would eventually host the following Olympic Games in 1976.

== Munich massacre ==
The Games were largely overshadowed by what has come to be known as the &quot;Munich massacre&quot;. Just before dawn on 5 September, a group of eight members of the Palestinian Black September militant organization broke into the Olympic Village and took eleven Israeli athletes, coaches and officials hostage in their apartments. Two of the hostages who resisted were killed in the first moments of the break-in; the subsequent standoff in the Olympic Village lasted for almost 18 hours.

Late in the evening of 5 September that same day, the terrorists and their nine remaining hostages were transferred by helicopter to the military airport of Fürstenfeldbruck, ostensibly to board a plane bound for an undetermined Arab country. The German authorities planned to ambush them there, but underestimated the numbers of their opposition and were thus undermanned. During a botched rescue attempt, all of the Israeli hostages were killed. Four of them were shot, then incinerated when one of the terrorists detonated a grenade inside the helicopter in which the hostages were sitting. The 5 remaining hostages were then shot and killed with a machine gun.
All but three of the terrorists were killed as well. Although arrested and imprisoned pending trial, they were released by the West German government on 29 October 1972, in exchange for the hijacked Lufthansa Flight 615. Two of those three were supposedly hunted down and assassinated later by the Mossad. Jamal Al-Gashey, who is believed to be the sole survivor, is still living today in hiding in an unspecified African country with his wife and two children. The Olympic events were suspended several hours after the initial attack for the first time in the modern Olympic Games history, but once the incident was concluded, Avery Brundage, the International Olympic Committee president, declared that &quot;the Games must go on&quot;. A memorial ceremony was then held in the Olympic stadium, and the competitions resumed after a stoppage of 34 hours. Due to the suspension, the Games that were originally to close on 10 September were rescheduled to 11 September. The attack prompted heightened security at subsequent Olympics beginning with the 1976 Winter Olympics.

The massacre led the German federal government to re-examine its anti-terrorism policies, which at the time were dominated by a pacifist approach imposed after World War II. This led to the creation of the elite counter-terrorist unit GSG 9, similar to the British SAS. It also led Israel to launch the Mossad assassinations following the Munich massacre, in which those suspected of involvement were systematically tracked down and assassinated.

The events of the Munich massacre were chronicled in the Oscar-winning documentary, &quot;One Day in September&quot;. An account of the aftermath is also dramatized in three films: the 1976 made-for-TV movie &quot;21 Hours at Munich&quot;, the 1986 made-for-TV movie &quot;Sword of Gideon&quot; and Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 2005 film &quot;Munich&quot;. In her film &quot;1972&quot;, Artist Sarah Morris interviews Georg Sieber, a former police psychiatrist who advised the Olympics&#x27; security team, about the events and aftermath of Black September.

== Highlights ==

* These were the final Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of Avery Brundage.
* American Mark Spitz set a world record when he won seven gold medals (while on the way to setting a new world record for each of his seven gold medals) in a single Olympics, bringing his lifetime total to nine (he had won two golds in Mexico City&#x27;s Games four years earlier). Being Jewish, Spitz was asked to leave Munich before the closing ceremonies for his own protection, after fears arose that he would be an additional target of those responsible for the Munich massacre. Spitz&#x27;s record stood until 2008, when it was beaten by Michael Phelps who won eight gold medals in the pool.
* Olga Korbut, a Soviet gymnast, became a media star after winning a gold medal in the team competition event, failing to win in the individual all-around after a fall (she was beaten by teammate Lyudmilla Turischeva), and finally winning two gold medals in the balance beam and the floor exercise events.
* In the final of the men&#x27;s basketball, the United States lost to the Soviet Union in what is widely considered as the most controversial game in international basketball history. In a close-fought match, the U.S. team appeared to have won by a score of 50–49. However, the final three seconds of the game were replayed three times by judges until the Soviet team came out on top and claimed a 51–50 victory. Ultimately the U.S. team refused to accept their silver medals, which are believed to be held in a vault in Lausanne, Switzerland. It has come to light since that five of the medals are missing and believed to be in the hands of a German Olympic official with Nazi ties.
* Lasse Virén of Finland won the 5,000 and 10,000 m (the latter after a fall), a feat he repeated in the 1976 Summer Olympics.
* Valeriy Borzov of the Soviet Union won both the 100 m and 200 m in track and field. 
* The 100 metres event was notable for the absence of favorites and world record holders Eddie Hart and Rey Robinson for their quarterfinal heats. American sprint coach Stan Wright, had been given the wrong starting time. All three qualified American athletes were at the ABC television headquarters watching what they thought were replays of their morning preliminary races. In fact, they were watching live coverage of the races they should have been in. Hart and Robinson, scheduled in the first two races, missed their heats. The athletes rushed to the stadium, with Robert Taylor hurrying to take off his warm up uniform before running the later heat.
* Two American 400 m runners, Vincent Matthews (gold medalist) and Wayne Collett (silver medalist), staged a protest on the victory podium, talking to each other and failing to stand at attention during the medal ceremony. They were banned by the IOC, as Tommie Smith and John Carlos had been in the 1968 Summer Olympics. Since John Smith had pulled a hamstring in the final and had been ruled unfit to run, the United States were forced to scratch from the 4×400 m relay where they would have been heavily favored to win.
* Dave Wottle won the men&#x27;s 800 m, after being last for the first 600 m, at which point he started to pass runner after runner up the final straightaway, finally grabbing the lead in the final 18 metres to win by 0.03 seconds ahead of the favorite, the Soviet Yevgeny Arzhanov. At the victory ceremony, Wottle forgot to remove his golf cap. This was interpreted by some as a form of protest against the Vietnam War, but Wottle later apologized.
* Australian swimmer Shane Gould won three gold medals, a silver, and a bronze medal at the age of 15.
* Hurdler Abdalá Bucaram carried the Ecuadorian flag at the opening ceremony. 24 years later he became the President of Ecuador. In Munich, he had to pull out of his event due to injury.
* Handball (last held in 1936) and Archery (last held in 1920) returned as Olympic sports after a long absence.
* Slalom canoeing was held for the first time at the Olympics.
* Dan Gable won the gold medal in wrestling without having a single point scored against him. No other athlete has ever accomplished such a feat in Olympic wrestling.
* Wim Ruska became the first judoka to win two gold medals.
* For the first time, the Olympic Oath was taken by a representative of the referees.
* American Frank Shorter, who was born in Munich, became the first from his country in 64 years to win the Olympic marathon. As Shorter was nearing the stadium, German student Norbert Sudhaus entered the stadium wearing a track uniform, joined the race and ran the last kilometre; thinking he was the winner, the crowd began cheering him before officials realized the hoax and security escorted Sudhaus off the track. Arriving seconds later, Shorter was understandably perplexed to see someone ahead of him and to hear the boos and catcalls meant for Sudhaus. This was the third time in Olympic history that an American had won the marathon (after Thomas Hicks 1904 and Johnny Hayes 1908) — and in none of those three instances did the winner enter the stadium first.

* Rick DeMont of the United States originally won the gold medal in the men&#x27;s 400 metre freestyle swimming. Following the race, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) stripped DeMont of his gold medal after his post-race urinalysis tested positive for traces of the banned substance ephedrine contained in his prescription asthma medication, Marax. The positive test following the 400-meter freestyle final also deprived him of a chance at multiple medals, as he was not permitted to swim in any other events at the 1972 Olympics, including the 1,500-meter freestyle for which he was the then-current world record-holder. Before the Olympics, DeMont had properly declared his asthma medications on his medical disclosure forms, but the U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) had not cleared them with the IOC&#x27;s medical committee. The United States Olympic Committee (USOC) has recognized his gold medal performance in the 1972 Summer Olympics in 2001, but only the IOC has the power to restore his medal, and it has refused to do so as of 2020.
* The men&#x27;s pole vault field event at the games took place on 1 &amp; 2 September. Controversy arose when the new Cata-Pole, used by defending champion American Bob Seagren and Sweden&#x27;s Kjell Isaksson, was declared to be illegal, by the IAAF, on 25 July. The pole was banned based on the fact that the pole contained carbon fibers; after an East German-led protest revealed that it contained no carbon fibers, the ban was lifted on 27 August. Three days later the IAAF reversed itself again, reinstating the ban. The poles were then confiscated from the athletes. Seagren and Isaksson believed this gave other athletes, like the eventual gold medalist, Wolfgang Nordwig, an unfair advantage. Seagren and Isaksson were given substitute poles which they had never used before to jump with. Isaksson, who had lost the world record to Seagren only two months earlier, didn&#x27;t clear a height in the qualifying round and was eliminated. After Seagren&#x27;s last vault he was so incensed by the way IAAF officials handled the event, he took the pole he had been forced to vault with and handed it back to IAAF President Adriaan Paulen. This was the first Olympics where the pole vault had not been won by an American. Prior to 1972, the United States had won 16 straight. Since 1972, the United States has won the men&#x27;s pole vault only twice, equalling the record of Poland and former republics of the Soviet Union. France has won three times since 1984.
* Badminton and water skiing were demonstration sports.

==Cost==
&quot;The Oxford Olympics Study&quot; established the outturn cost of the Munich 1972 Summer Olympics at US$1.0 billion in 2015-dollars. This includes sports-related costs only, that is, (i) &quot;operational costs&quot; incurred by the organizing committee for the purpose of staging the Games, e.g., expenditures for technology, transportation, workforce, administration, security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services, and (ii) &quot;direct capital costs&quot; incurred by the host city and country or private investors to build, e.g., the competition venues, the Olympic village, international broadcast center, and media and press center, which are required to host the Games. Indirect capital costs are &quot;not&quot; included, such as for road, rail, or airport infrastructure, or for hotel upgrades or other business investment incurred in preparation for the Games but not directly related to staging the Games. The cost for Munich 1972 compares with costs of US$4.6 billion for Rio 2016, US$15 billion for London 2012 (the most costly Summer Olympics to date) and US$51 billion for Sochi 2014 — the most expensive Olympic Games in history. Average cost for Summer Games since 1960 is US$5.2 billion.

== Participating National Olympic Committees ==
Eleven nations made their first Olympic appearance in Munich: Albania, Dahomey (now Benin), Gabon, North Korea, Lesotho, Malawi, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Swaziland, Togo, Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso).

Rhodesia&#x27;s invitation to take part in the 1972 Summer Games was withdrawn by the International Olympic Committee four days before the opening ceremony, in response to African countries&#x27; (such as Ethiopia and Kenya) protests against the Rhodesian government. (Rhodesia did, however, compete in the 1972 Summer Paralympics, held a little earlier in Heidelberg.) The People&#x27;s Republic of China last competed at the 1952 Summer Games but had since withdrawn from the IOC due to a dispute with the Republic of China over the right to represent China.

==Doping==
The report, titled &quot;Doping in Germany from 1950 to today&quot;, details how the West German government helped fund a wide-scale doping program. Doping of East German athletes also, by the GDR government, was systematic and prevalent at the Munich Games of 1972.

<text>The 1968 Summer Olympics (), officially known as the Games of the XIX Olympiad () and officially branded as Mexico 1968 (), were an international multi-sport event held from 12 to 27 October 1968 in Mexico City, Mexico. These were the first Olympic Games to be staged in Latin America, the first to be staged in a Spanish-speaking country, and the first to be staged in the Global South. Consequently, these games also marked the first time that there would be a gap of two Olympic Games not to be held in Europe. They were also the first Games to use an all-weather (smooth) track for track and field events instead of the traditional cinder track, as well as the first example of the Olympics exclusively using electronic timekeeping equipment.

The 1968 Games were the third to be held in the last quarter of the year, after the 1956 Games in Melbourne and the 1964 Games in Tokyo. The 1968 Mexican Student Movement was crushed days prior, hence the Games were correlated to the government&#x27;s repression.

The United States won the most gold and overall medals for the last time until the 1984 Summer Games.

==Host city selection==
On 18 October 1963, at the 60th IOC Session in Baden-Baden, West Germany, Mexico City finished ahead of bids from Detroit, Buenos Aires and Lyon to host the Games.

==Olympic torch relay==
The 1968 torch relay recreated the route taken by Christopher Columbus to the New World, journeying from Greece through Italy and Spain to San Salvador Island, Bahamas, and then on to Mexico. American sculptor James Metcalf, an expatriate in Mexico, won the commission to forge the Olympic torch for the 1968 Summer Games.

==Visual identity==
The logo is viewed as a Mexican cultural icon. It was the subject of dispute between American designer Lance Wyman and Mexican architect Pedro Ramírez Vázquez over who originated the graphic concepts. Architect Eduardo Terrazas also worked under Ramirez&#x27;s direction to develop the concept. A pink chacmool jaguar, which was sold in souvenir shops, is considered an unofficial mascot. The dove of peace was also a symbol of the Games, which was appropriated by student protesters with a bayonet piercing it.

==Highlights==

* In the medal award ceremony for the men&#x27;s 200 metres race, Black American athletes Tommie Smith (gold) and John Carlos (bronze) took a stand for civil rights by raising their black-gloved fists and wearing black socks in lieu of shoes. The Australian Peter Norman, who had run second, wore an American &quot;human rights&quot; badge as a gesture of support to them on the podium. In response, the IOC banned Smith and Carlos from the Olympic Games for life, and Norman&#x27;s omission from Australia&#x27;s Olympic team in 1972 was allegedly as punishment.
* George Foreman won the gold medal in heavyweight boxing division by defeating Soviet Jonas Čepulis via a second-round TKO. After the victory, Foreman waved a small American flag as he bowed to the crowd.
* The high elevation of Mexico City, at above sea level, influenced many of the events, particularly in track and field. No other Summer Olympic Games before or since have been held at high elevation.
* In addition to high elevation, this was the first Olympics to use a synthetic all-weather surface for track and field events; the &quot;Tartan&quot; surface was originally developed by 3M for horse racing, but did not catch on. The tracks at previous Olympics were conventional cinder.
* For the first time, East and West Germany competed as separate teams, after being forced by the IOC to compete as a combined German team in 1956, 1960, and 1964. 
* Al Oerter won his fourth consecutive gold medal in the discus to become only the second athlete to achieve this feat in an individual event, and the first in athletics.
* Bob Beamon leapt in the long jump, an incredible improvement over the previous world record. It stood as the world record for 23 years, until broken by American Mike Powell in 1991; yet it has stood as the current Olympic record for years. Jim Hines, Tommie Smith and Lee Evans also set long-standing world records in the 100 m, 200 m and 400 m, respectively.
* In the triple jump, the previous world record was improved five times by three different athletes. Winner Viktor Saneev also won in 1972 and 1976, and won silver in 1980.
* Dick Fosbury won the gold medal in the high jump using his unconventional Fosbury flop technique, which quickly became the dominant technique in the event.
* Věra Čáslavská of Czechoslovakia won four gold medals in gymnastics and protested the Soviet invasion of her country.
* Debbie Meyer became the first swimmer to win three individual gold medals, in the 200, 400 and 800 m freestyle events. The 800 m was a new long-distance event for women. Meyer was only 16 years old, a student at Rio Americano High School in Sacramento, California. Meyer was the first of several American teenagers to win the 800 m, with Katie Ledecky being her notable successor.
* American swimmer Charlie Hickcox won three gold medals (200 m IM, 400 m IM, 4 × 100 m medley relay) and one silver medal (100 m backstroke).
* The introduction of doping tests resulted in the first disqualification because of doping: Swedish pentathlete Hans-Gunnar Liljenwall was disqualified for alcohol use (he drank several beers just prior to competing).
* John Stephen Akhwari of Tanzania became internationally famous after finishing the marathon, in the last place, despite a dislocated knee.
* This was the first of three Olympic participation by Jacques Rogge. He competed in yachting and would later become the president of the IOC.
* Norma Enriqueta Basilio de Sotelo of Mexico became the first woman to light the Olympic cauldron with the Olympic flame.
* It was the first games at which there was a significant African presence in men&#x27;s distance running. Africans won at least one medal in all running events from 800 meters to the marathon, and in so doing they set a trend for future games. Most of these runners came from high-altitude areas of countries like Kenya and Ethiopia, and they were well-prepared for the 2240 m elevation of Mexico City.
* Kipchoge Keino of Kenya, competing in spite of unexpected bouts of severe abdominal pain later diagnosed as a gall bladder infection, finished the 10,000 meters in spite of collapsing from pain with two laps to go, won silver in the 5000, and won gold in the 1500 meters.
* It was the first Olympic games in which the closing ceremony was transmitted in color to the world, as well as the events themselves.

==Controversies==

===South Africa===

After being banned from participating in 1964, South Africa - under its new leader John Vorster - had made diplomatic overtures to improve relations with neighboring countries and internationally, suggesting legal changes to allow South Africa to compete with an integrated, multiracial team internationally. The nominal obstacle behind South Africa&#x27;s exclusion thus removed, the country was thus provisionally invited to the Games, on the understanding that all segregation and discrimination in sport would be eliminated by the 1972 Games. However, African countries and African American athletes promised to boycott the Games if South Africa was present, and Eastern Bloc countries threatened to do likewise. In April 1968 the IOC conceded that &quot;it would be most unwise for South Africa to participate&quot;. It was thus the first Olympics where South Africa was positively excluded, which continued until the Olympics of 1992.

===Tlatelolco massacre===

Responding to growing social unrest and protests, the government of Mexico had increased economic and political suppression, against labor unions in particular, in the decade building up to the Olympics. A series of protest marches in the city in August gathered significant attendance, with an estimated 500,000 taking part on 27 August. President Gustavo Díaz Ordaz ordered the police occupation of the National Autonomous University of Mexico in September, but protests continued. Using the prominence brought by the Olympics, students gathered in Plaza de las Tres Culturas in Tlatelolco to call for greater civil and democratic rights and showed disdain for the Olympics with slogans such as &quot;¡No queremos olimpiadas, queremos revolución!&quot; (&quot;We don&#x27;t want Olympics, we want revolution!&quot;).

Ten days before the start of the Olympics, the government ordered the gathering in Plaza de las Tres Culturas to be broken up. Some 5000 soldiers and 200 tankettes surrounded the plaza. Hundreds of protesters and civilians were killed and over 1000 were arrested. At the time, the event was portrayed in the national media as the military suppression of a violent student uprising, but later analysis indicates that the gathering was peaceful prior to the army&#x27;s advance.

===Black Power salute===


On 16 October 1968, African American sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos, the gold and bronze medalists in the men&#x27;s 200-meter race, took their places on the podium for the medal ceremony wearing human rights badges and black socks without shoes, lowered their heads and each raised a black-gloved fist as &quot;The Star Spangled Banner&quot; was played, in solidarity with the Black Freedom Movement in the United States. Both were members of the Olympic Project for Human Rights. International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Avery Brundage deemed it to be a domestic political statement unfit for the apolitical, international forum the Olympic Games were intended to be. In response to their actions, he ordered Smith and Carlos suspended from the US team and banned from the Olympic Village. When the US Olympic Committee refused, Brundage threatened to ban the entire US track team. This threat led to the expulsion of the two athletes from the Games.

Peter Norman, the Australian sprinter who came second in the 200-meter race, also wore an Olympic Project for Human Rights badge during the medal ceremony. Norman was the one who suggested that Carlos and Smith wear one glove each. His actions resulted in him being ostracized by Australian media and a reprimand by his country&#x27;s Olympic authorities. He was not sent to the 1972 games, despite several times making the qualifying time, though opinions differ over whether that was due to the 1968 protest. When Australia hosted the 2000 Summer Olympics, he had no part in the opening ceremony, though the significance of that is also debated. In 2006, after Norman died of a heart attack, Smith and Carlos were pallbearers at Norman&#x27;s funeral.

===Věra Čáslavská and the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia===
In another notable incident in the gymnastics competition, while standing on the medal podium after the balance beam event final, in which Natalia Kuchinskaya of the Soviet Union had controversially taken the gold, Czechoslovakian gymnast Věra Čáslavská quietly turned her head down and away during the playing of the Soviet national anthem. The action was Čáslavská&#x27;s silent protest against the recent Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. Her protest was repeated when she accepted her medal for her floor exercise routine when the judges changed the preliminary scores of the Soviet Larisa Petrik to allow her to tie with Čáslavská for the gold. While Čáslavská&#x27;s countrymen supported her actions and her outspoken opposition to Soviet control (she had publicly signed and supported Ludvik Vaculik&#x27;s &quot;Two Thousand Words&quot; manifesto), the new regime responded by banning her from both sporting events and international travel for many years and made her an outcast from society until the fall of communist regime in Czechoslovakia.

===Demonstration sports===
*

The organizers declined to hold a judo tournament at the Olympics, even though it had been a full-medal sport four years earlier. This was the last time judo was not included in the Olympic games. 

Baseball had been featured as a demonstration sport at the 1964 Tokyo Games, but not in 1968, despite Mexico&#x27;s baseball heritage. Instead, a separate international tournament was held in Mexico City, shortly after the conclusion of the Olympic Games.

==Participating National Olympic Committees==
East Germany and West Germany competed as separate entities for the first time at a Summer Olympiad, and would remain so through 1988. Barbados competed for the first time as an independent country. Also competing for the first time in a Summer Olympiad were British Honduras (now Belize), Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (as Congo-Kinshasa), El Salvador, Guinea, Honduras, Kuwait, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Sierra Leone, and the United States Virgin Islands. Singapore returned to the Games as an independent country after competing as part of the Malaysian team in 1964. Suriname and Libya actually competed for the first time (in 1960 and 1964, respectively, they took part in the Opening Ceremony, but their athletes later withdrew from the competition). The People&#x27;s Republic of China last competed at the 1952 Summer Games but had since withdrawn from the IOC due to a dispute with the Republic of China over the right to represent China.

== Boycotting countries ==
North Korea withdrew from the 1968 Games because of two incidents that strained its relations with the IOC. First, the IOC had barred North Korean track and field athletes from the 1968 Games because they had participated in the rival Games of the New Emerging Forces (GANEFO) in 1966. Secondly, the IOC had ordered the nation to compete under the name &quot;North Korea&quot; in the 1968 Games, whereas the country itself would have preferred its official name: &quot;Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea&quot;.

==Medal count==

These are the top ten nations that won medals at the 1968 Games. Host Mexico won nine medals in total.

<doc id="83117" wikidata="Q170509" url="?curid=83117" title="Henry James">
<text>Henry James ( – ) was an American-British author. He is regarded as a key transitional figure between literary realism and literary modernism, and is considered by many to be among the greatest novelists in the English language. He was the son of Henry James Sr. and the brother of philosopher and psychologist William James and diarist Alice James.

He is best known for his novels dealing with the social and marital interplay between &quot;émigré &quot;Americans, the English, and continental Europeans, such as &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot;. His later works, such as &quot;The Ambassadors&quot;, &quot;The Wings of the Dove&quot; and &quot;The Golden Bowl&quot; were increasingly experimental. In describing the internal states of mind and social dynamics of his characters, James often wrote in a style in which ambiguous or contradictory motives and impressions were overlaid or juxtaposed in the discussion of a character&#x27;s psyche. For their unique ambiguity, as well as for other aspects of their composition, his late works have been compared to Impressionist painting.

His novella &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; has garnered a reputation as the most analysed and ambiguous ghost story in the English language and remains his most widely adapted work in other media. He wrote other highly regarded ghost stories, such as &quot;The Jolly Corner&quot;.

James published articles and books of criticism, travel, biography, autobiography, and plays. Born in the United States, James largely relocated to Europe as a young man, and eventually settled in England, becoming a British citizen in 1915, a year before his death. James was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1911, 1912, and 1916. Jorge Luis Borges said &quot;I have visited some literatures of East and West; I have compiled an encyclopedic compendium of fantastic literature; I have translated Kafka, Melville, and Bloy; I know of no stranger work than that of Henry James.&quot;

==Life==

===Early years, 1843–1883===

James was born at 21 Washington Place (facing Washington Square) in New York City on 15 April 1843. His parents were Mary Walsh and Henry James Sr. His father was intelligent and steadfastly congenial. He was a lecturer and philosopher who had inherited independent means from his father, William James, a farmer from Corkish, County Cavan, Ireland, who had emigrated to Albany and became the second richest man in the state after John Jacob Astor through banking and real estate. Mary came from a wealthy family long settled in New York City. Her sister Katherine lived with her adult family for an extended period of time. Henry Jr. was one of four boys, the others being William, who was one year his senior, and younger brothers Wilkinson (Wilkie) and Robertson. His younger sister was Alice. Both of his parents were of Irish and Scottish descent.

Before he was a year old, his father sold the house at Washington Place and took the family to Europe, where they lived for a time in a cottage in Windsor Great Park in England. The family returned to New York in 1845, and Henry spent much of his childhood living between his paternal grandmother&#x27;s home in Albany, and a house, 58 West Fourteenth Street, in Manhattan. A painting of a view of Florence by Thomas Cole hung in the front parlor of this house on West Fourteenth. His education was calculated by his father to expose him to many influences, primarily scientific and philosophical; it was described by Percy Lubbock, the editor of his selected letters, as &quot;extraordinarily haphazard and promiscuous.&quot; Once, a cousin of the James family came down to the house in Fourteenth Street and, one evening during his stay, read the first installment of &quot;David Copperfield&quot; aloud to the elders of the family: Henry Junior had sneaked down from his bedroom to listen surreptitiously to the reading, until a scene involving the Murdstones led him to &quot;loud[ly] sob,&quot; whereupon he was discovered and sent back to bed.

Between 1855 and 1860, the James household travelled to London, Paris, Geneva, Boulogne-sur-Mer, Bonn, and Newport, Rhode Island, according to the father&#x27;s current interests and publishing ventures, retreating to the United States when funds were low. The James family arrived in Paris in July 1855 and took rooms at a hotel in the Rue de la Paix. Some time between 1856 and 1857, when William was fourteen and Henry thirteen, the two brothers visited the Louvre and the Luxembourg Palace. Henry studied primarily with tutors, and briefly attended schools while the family travelled in Europe. A tutor of the James children in Paris, M. Lerambert, had written a volume of verse that was well reviewed by Sainte-Beuve. Their longest stays were in France, where Henry began to feel at home and became fluent in French. He had a stutter, which seems to have manifested itself only when he spoke English; in French, he did not stutter.

In the summer of 1857, the James family went to Boulogne-sur-Mer, where they set up house at No. 20 Rue Neuve Chaussée, and where Henry was a regular customer at an English lending library. In the autumn of that year, Henry Senior wrote from Boulogne to a friend that &quot;Henry is not so fond of study, properly so-called, as of reading...He is a devourer of libraries, and an immense writer of novels and dramas. He has considerable talent as a writer, but I am at a loss to know whether he will ever accomplish much.&quot; William recorded in a letter to their parents in Paris, while the boys were staying in Bonn, that Henry and Garth Wilkinson would wrestle &quot;when study has made them dull and sleepy.&quot;

In 1860, the family returned to Newport. There, Henry befriended Thomas Sergeant Perry, who was to become a celebrated literary academic in adulthood, and painter John La Farge, for whom Henry sat as a subject, and who introduced him to French literature, and in particular, to Balzac. James later called Balzac his &quot;greatest master&quot;, and said that he had learned more about the craft of fiction from him than from anyone else.

In July 1861, Henry and Thomas Sergeant Perry paid a visit to an encampment of wounded and invalid Union soldiers on the Rhode Island shore, at Portsmouth Grove; he took walks and had conversations with numerous soldiers and in later years compared this experience to those of Walt Whitman as a volunteer nurse. In the autumn of 1861, James received an injury, probably to his back, while fighting a fire. This injury, which resurfaced at times throughout his life, made him unfit for military service in the American Civil War. His younger brothers Garth Wilkinson and Robertson, however, both served, with Wilkinson serving as an officer in the 54th Massachusetts.

In 1864, the James family moved to Boston, Massachusetts, to be near William, who had enrolled first in the Lawrence Scientific School at Harvard and then in the medical school. In 1862, Henry attended Harvard Law School, but realised that he was not interested in studying law. He pursued his interest in literature and associated with authors and critics William Dean Howells and Charles Eliot Norton in Boston and Cambridge and formed lifelong friendships with Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., the future Supreme Court justice, and with James T. Fields and Annie Adams Fields, his first professional mentors. In 1865, Louisa May Alcott visited Boston and dined with the James family; she was to write in her journals that &quot;Henry Jr...was very friendly. Being a literary youth he gave me advice, as if he had been eighty, and I a girl.&quot;

His first published work was a review of a stage performance, &quot;Miss Maggie Mitchell in &quot;Fanchon the Cricket&quot;&quot;, published in 1863. About a year later, &quot;A Tragedy of Error&quot;, his first short story, was published anonymously. James&#x27;s first literary payment was for an appreciation of Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s novels, written for the &quot;North American Review&quot;. He wrote fiction and nonfiction pieces for &quot;The Nation&quot; and &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, where Fields was editor. In 1865, Ernest Lawrence Godkin, the founder of &quot;The Nation&quot;, visited the James family at their Boston residence in Ashburton Place; the purpose of his visit was to solicit contributions from Henry Senior and Henry Junior for the inaugural issue of the journal. Henry Junior was later to describe his friendship with Godkin as &quot;one of the longest and happiest of my life.&quot; In 1871, he published his first novel, &quot;Watch and Ward&quot;, in serial form in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;. The novel was later published in book form in 1878.

During a 14-month trip through Europe in 1869–70, he met John Ruskin, Charles Dickens, Matthew Arnold, William Morris, and George Eliot. Rome impressed him profoundly. &quot;Here I am then in the Eternal City&quot;, he wrote to his brother William. &quot;At last—for the first time—I live!&quot; He attempted to support himself as a freelance writer in Rome and then secured a position as Paris correspondent for the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; through the influence of its editor, John Hay. When these efforts failed, he returned to New York City. During 1874 and 1875, he published &quot;Transatlantic Sketches&quot;, &quot;A Passionate Pilgrim&quot; and &quot;Roderick Hudson&quot;. In 1875, James wrote for &quot;The Nation&quot; every week; he received anywhere from $3 to $10 for brief paragraphs, $12 to $25 for book reviews and $25 to $40 for travel articles and lengthier items. During this early period in his career, he was influenced by Nathaniel Hawthorne.

In the fall of 1875, he moved to the Latin Quarter of Paris. Aside from two trips to America, he spent the next three decades—the rest of his life—in Europe. In Paris, he met Zola, Daudet, Maupassant, Turgenev and others. He stayed in Paris only a year before settling in London, where he established relationships with Macmillan and other publishers, who paid for serial instalments that they published in book form. The audience for these serialised novels was largely made up of middle-class women, and James struggled to fashion serious literary work within the strictures imposed by editors&#x27; and publishers&#x27; notions of what was suitable for young women to read. He lived in rented rooms, but was able to join gentlemen&#x27;s clubs that had libraries and where he could entertain male friends. He was introduced to English society by Henry Adams and Charles Milnes Gaskell, the latter introducing him to the Travellers&#x27; and the Reform Clubs. He was also an honorary member of the Savile Club, St James&#x27;s Club and, in 1882, the Athenaeum Club.

In England, he met the leading figures of politics and culture. He continued to be a prolific writer, producing &quot;The American&quot; (1877), &quot;The Europeans&quot; (1878), a revision of &quot;Watch and Ward&quot; (1878), &quot;French Poets and Novelists&quot; (1878), &quot;Hawthorne&quot; (1879), and several shorter works of fiction. In 1878, &quot;Daisy Miller&quot; established his fame on both sides of the Atlantic. It drew notice perhaps mostly because it depicted a woman whose behaviour is outside the social norms of Europe. He also began his first masterpiece, &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot;, which appeared in 1881.

In 1877, he first visited Wenlock Abbey in Shropshire, home of his friend Charles Milnes Gaskell, whom he had met through Henry Adams. He was much inspired by the darkly romantic abbey and the surrounding countryside, which feature in his essay &quot;Abbeys and Castles&quot;. In particular, the gloomy monastic fishponds behind the abbey are said to have inspired the lake in &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;.

While living in London, James continued to follow the careers of the French realists, Émile Zola in particular. Their stylistic methods influenced his own work in the years to come. Hawthorne&#x27;s influence on him faded during this period, replaced by George Eliot and Ivan Turgenev. The period from 1878 to 1881 had the publication of &quot;The Europeans&quot;, &quot;Washington Square&quot;, &quot;Confidence&quot; and &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot;.

The period from 1882 to 1883 was marked by several losses. His mother died in January 1882, while James was in Washington, D.C., on an extended visit to America. He returned to his parents&#x27; home in Cambridge, where he was together with all four of his siblings for the first time in 15 years. He returned to Europe in mid-1882, but was back in America by the end of the year following the death of his father. Emerson, an old family friend, died in 1882. His brother Wilkie and friend Turgenev both died in 1883.

===Middle years, 1884–1897===

In 1884, James made another visit to Paris, where he met again with Zola, Daudet, and Goncourt. He had been following the careers of the French &quot;realist&quot; or &quot;naturalist&quot; writers, and was increasingly influenced by them. In 1886, he published &quot;The Bostonians&quot; and &quot;The Princess Casamassima&quot;, both influenced by the French writers that he had studied assiduously. Critical reaction and sales were poor. He wrote to Howells that the books had hurt his career rather than helped because they had &quot;reduced the desire, and demand, for my productions to zero&quot;. During this time, he became friends with Robert Louis Stevenson, John Singer Sargent, Edmund Gosse, George du Maurier, Paul Bourget, and Constance Fenimore Woolson. His third novel from the 1880s was &quot;The Tragic Muse&quot;. Although he was following the precepts of Zola in his novels of the &#x27;80s, their tone and attitude are closer to the fiction of Alphonse Daudet. The lack of critical and financial success for his novels during this period led him to try writing for the theatre; His dramatic works and his experiences with theatre are discussed below.

In the last quarter of 1889, &quot;for pure and copious lucre,&quot; he started translating &quot;Port Tarascon&quot;, the third volume of Daudet&#x27;s adventures of Tartarin of Tarascon. Serialized in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Monthly&quot; from June 1890, this translation – praised as &quot;clever&quot; by &quot;The Spectator&quot; – was published in January 1891 by Sampson Low, Marston, Searle &amp; Rivington.

After the stage failure of &quot;Guy Domville&quot; in 1895, James was near despair and thoughts of death plagued him. His depression was compounded by the deaths of those closest to him, including his sister Alice in 1892; his friend Wolcott Balestier in 1891; and Stevenson and Fenimore Woolson in 1894. The sudden death of Fenimore Woolson in January 1894, and the speculations of suicide surrounding her death, were particularly painful for him. Leon Edel wrote that the reverberations from Fenimore Woolson&#x27;s death were such that &quot;we can read a strong element of guilt and bewilderment in his letters, and, even more, in those extraordinary tales of the next half-dozen years, &quot;The Altar of the Dead&quot; and &quot;The Beast in the Jungle&quot;.

The years spent on dramatic works were not entirely a loss. As he moved into the last phase of his career, he found ways to adapt dramatic techniques into the novel form. In the late 1880s and throughout the 1890s, James made several trips through Europe. He spent a long stay in Italy in 1887. In 1888, he published the short novel &quot;The Aspern Papers&quot; and &quot;The Reverberator&quot;.

===Late years, 1898–1916===

In 1897–1898, he moved to Rye, Sussex and wrote &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;; 1899–1900 had the publication of &quot;The Awkward Age&quot; and &quot;The Sacred Fount&quot;. During 1902–1904, he wrote &quot;The Wings of the Dove,&quot; &quot;The Ambassadors&quot;, and &quot;The Golden Bowl&quot;.

In 1904, he revisited America and lectured on Balzac. In 1906–1910, he published &quot;The American Scene&quot; and edited the &quot;New York Edition&quot;, a 24-volume collection of his works. In 1910, his brother William died; Henry had just joined William from an unsuccessful search for relief in Europe, on what turned out to be Henry&#x27;s last visit to the United States (summer 1910 to July 1911) and was near him when he died.

In 1913, he wrote his autobiographies, &quot;A Small Boy and Others&quot; and &quot;Notes of a Son and Brother&quot;. After the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, he did war work. In 1915, he became a British citizen and was awarded the Order of Merit the following year. He died on 28 February 1916, in Chelsea, London, and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium. A memorial was built to him in Chelsea Old Church. He had requested that his ashes be buried in Cambridge Cemetery in Massachusetts. This was not legally possible, but William&#x27;s wife smuggled his ashes onboard a ship and sneaked them through customs, allowing her to bury him in their family plot.

===Sexuality===
James regularly rejected suggestions that he should marry, and after settling in London, proclaimed himself &quot;a bachelor&quot;. F. W. Dupee, in several volumes on the James family, originated the theory that he had been in love with his cousin, Mary (&quot;Minnie&quot;) Temple, but that a neurotic fear of sex kept him from admitting such affections: &quot;James&#x27;s invalidism ... was itself the symptom of some fear of or scruple against sexual love on his part.&quot; Dupee used an episode from James&#x27;s memoir, &quot;A Small Boy and Others,&quot; recounting a dream of a Napoleonic image in the Louvre, to exemplify James&#x27;s romanticism about Europe, a Napoleonic fantasy into which he fled.

Between 1953 and 1972, Leon Edel wrote a major five-volume biography of James, which used unpublished letters and documents after Edel gained the permission of James&#x27;s family. Edel&#x27;s portrayal of James included the suggestion he was celibate, a view first propounded by critic Saul Rosenzweig in 1943. In 1996, Sheldon M. Novick published &quot;Henry James: The Young Master&quot;, followed by &quot;Henry James: The Mature Master&quot; (2007). The first book &quot;caused something of an uproar in Jamesian circles&quot; as it challenged the previous received notion of celibacy, a once-familiar paradigm in biographies of homosexuals when direct evidence was nonexistent. Novick also criticised Edel for following the discounted Freudian interpretation of homosexuality &quot;as a kind of failure.&quot; The difference of opinion erupted in a series of exchanges between Edel (and later Fred Kaplan filling in for Edel) and Novick, which were published by the online magazine &quot;Slate&quot;, with Novick arguing that even the suggestion of celibacy went against James&#x27;s own injunction &quot;live!&quot;—not &quot;fantasize!&quot;

A letter James wrote in old age to Hugh Walpole has been cited as an explicit statement of this. Walpole confessed to him of indulging in &quot;high jinks&quot;, and James wrote a reply endorsing it: &quot;We must know, as much as possible, in our beautiful art, yours &amp; mine, what we are talking about—&amp; the only way to know it is to have lived &amp; loved &amp; cursed &amp; floundered &amp; enjoyed &amp; suffered—I don&#x27;t think I regret a single &#x27;excess&#x27; of my responsive youth&quot;.

The interpretation of James as living a less austere emotional life has been subsequently explored by other scholars. The often intense politics of Jamesian scholarship has also been the subject of studies. Author Colm Tóibín has said that Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick&#x27;s &quot;Epistemology of the Closet&quot; made a landmark difference to Jamesian scholarship by arguing that he be read as a homosexual writer whose desire to keep his sexuality a secret shaped his layered style and dramatic artistry. According to Tóibín, such a reading &quot;removed James from the realm of dead white males who wrote about posh people. He became our contemporary.&quot;

James&#x27;s letters to expatriate American sculptor Hendrik Christian Andersen have attracted particular attention. James met the 27-year-old Andersen in Rome in 1899, when James was 56, and wrote letters to Andersen that are intensely emotional: &quot;I hold you, dearest boy, in my innermost love, &amp; count on your feeling me—in every throb of your soul&quot;. In a letter of 6 May 1904, to his brother William, James referred to himself as &quot;always your hopelessly celibate even though sexagenarian Henry&quot;. How accurate that description might have been is the subject of contention among James&#x27;s biographers, but the letters to Andersen were occasionally quasierotic: &quot;I put, my dear boy, my arm around you, &amp; feel the pulsation, thereby, as it were, of our excellent future &amp; your admirable endowment.&quot;

His numerous letters to the many young homosexual men among his close male friends are more forthcoming. To his homosexual friend Howard Sturgis, James could write: &quot;I repeat, almost to indiscretion, that I could live with you. Meanwhile, I can only try to live without you.&quot; In another letter Sturgis, following a long visit, James refers jocularly to their &quot;happy little congress of two&quot;. In letters to Hugh Walpole, he pursues convoluted jokes and puns about their relationship, referring to himself as an elephant who &quot;paws you oh so benevolently&quot; and winds about Walpole his &quot;well-meaning old trunk&quot;. His letters to Walter Berry printed by the Black Sun Press have long been celebrated for their lightly veiled eroticism.

However, James corresponded in equally extravagant language with his many female friends, writing, for example, to fellow novelist Lucy Clifford: &quot;Dearest Lucy! What shall I say? when I love you so very, very much, and see you nine times for once that I see Others! Therefore I think that—if you want it made clear to the meanest intelligence—I love you more than I love Others.&quot; To his New York friend Mary Cadwalader Rawle Jones: &quot;Dearest Mary Cadwalader. I yearn over you, but I yearn in vain; &amp; your long silence really breaks my heart, mystifies, depresses, almost alarms me, to the point even of making me wonder if poor unconscious &amp; doting old Célimare [Jones&#x27;s pet name for James] has &#x27;done&#x27; anything, in some dark somnambulism of the spirit, which has ... given you a bad moment, or a wrong impression, or a &#x27;colourable pretext&#x27; ... However these things may be, he loves you as tenderly as ever; nothing, to the end of time, will ever detach him from you, &amp; he remembers those Eleventh St. matutinal &quot;intimes&quot; hours, those telephonic matinées, as the most romantic of his life ...&quot; His long friendship with American novelist Constance Fenimore Woolson, in whose house he lived for a number of weeks in Italy in 1887, and his shock and grief over her suicide in 1894, are discussed in detail in Edel&#x27;s biography and play a central role in a study by Lyndall Gordon. Edel conjectured that Woolson was in love with James and killed herself in part because of his coldness, but Woolson&#x27;s biographers have objected to Edel&#x27;s account.

==Works==
===Style and themes===
James is one of the major figures of literature. His works frequently juxtapose characters from the Old World (Europe), embodying a feudal civilisation that is beautiful, often corrupt, and alluring, and from the New World (United States), where people are often brash, open, and assertive, and embody the virtues of the new American society—particularly personal freedom and a more exacting moral character. James explores this clash of personalities and cultures, in stories of personal relationships in which power is exercised well or badly.

His protagonists were often young American women facing oppression or abuse, and as his secretary Theodora Bosanquet remarked in her monograph &quot;Henry James at Work&quot;:


Philip Guedalla jokingly described three phases in the development of James&#x27;s prose: &quot;James I, James II, and The Old Pretender,&quot; and observers do often group his works of fiction into three periods. In his apprentice years, culminating with the masterwork &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot;, his style was simple and direct (by the standards of Victorian magazine writing) and he experimented widely with forms and methods, generally narrating from a conventionally omniscient point of view. Plots generally concern romance, except for the three big novels of social commentary that conclude this period. In the second period, as noted above, he abandoned the serialised novel and from 1890 to about 1897, he wrote short stories and plays. Finally, in his third and last period he returned to the long, serialised novel. Beginning in the second period, but most noticeably in the third; he increasingly abandoned direct statement in favour of frequent double negatives, and complex descriptive imagery. Single paragraphs began to run for page after page, in which an initial noun would be succeeded by pronouns surrounded by clouds of adjectives and prepositional clauses, far from their original referents, and verbs would be deferred and then preceded by a series of adverbs. The overall effect could be a vivid evocation of a scene as perceived by a sensitive observer. It has been debated whether this change of style was engendered by James&#x27;s shifting from writing to dictating to a typist, a change made during the composition of &quot;What Maisie Knew.&quot;

In its intense focus on the consciousness of his major characters, James&#x27;s later work foreshadows extensive developments in 20th-century fiction. Indeed, he might have influenced stream-of-consciousness writers such as Virginia Woolf, who not only read some of his novels but also wrote essays about them. Both contemporary and modern readers have found the late style difficult and unnecessary; his friend Edith Wharton, who admired him greatly, said that some passages in his work were all but incomprehensible. James was harshly portrayed by H. G. Wells as a hippopotamus laboriously attempting to pick up a pea that had got into a corner of its cage. The &quot;late James&quot; style was ably parodied by Max Beerbohm in &quot;The Mote in the Middle Distance&quot;.

More important for his work overall may have been his position as an expatriate, and in other ways an outsider, living in Europe. While he came from middle-class and provincial beginnings (seen from the perspective of European polite society), he worked very hard to gain access to all levels of society, and the settings of his fiction range from working-class to aristocratic, and often describe the efforts of middle-class Americans to make their way in European capitals. He confessed he got some of his best story ideas from gossip at the dinner table or at country house weekends. He worked for a living, however, and lacked the experiences of select schools, university, and army service, the common bonds of masculine society. He was furthermore a man whose tastes and interests were, according to the prevailing standards of Victorian era Anglo-American culture, rather feminine, and who was shadowed by the cloud of prejudice that then and later accompanied suspicions of his homosexuality. Edmund Wilson compared James&#x27;s objectivity to Shakespeare&#x27;s:

Many of James&#x27;s stories may also be seen as psychological thought experiments about selection. In his preface to the New York edition of &quot;The American&quot;, James describes the development of the story in his mind as exactly such: the &quot;situation&quot; of an American, &quot;some robust but insidiously beguiled and betrayed, some cruelly wronged, compatriot...&quot; with the focus of the story being on the response of this wronged man. &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot; may be an experiment to see what happens when an idealistic young woman suddenly becomes very rich. In many of his tales, characters seem to exemplify alternative futures and possibilities, as most markedly in &quot;The Jolly Corner&quot;, in which the protagonist and a ghost-doppelganger live alternative American and European lives; and in others, like &quot;The Ambassadors,&quot; an older James seems fondly to regard his own younger self facing a crucial moment.

===Major novels===
The first period of James&#x27;s fiction, usually considered to have culminated in &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot;, concentrated on the contrast between Europe and America. The style of these novels is generally straightforward and, though personally characteristic, well within the norms of 19th-century fiction. &quot;Roderick Hudson&quot; (1875) is a Künstlerroman that traces the development of the title character, an extremely talented sculptor. Although the book shows some signs of immaturity—this was James&#x27;s first serious attempt at a full-length novel—it has attracted favourable comment due to the vivid realisation of the three major characters: Roderick Hudson, superbly gifted but unstable and unreliable; Rowland Mallet, Roderick&#x27;s limited but much more mature friend and patron; and Christina Light, one of James&#x27;s most enchanting and maddening femmes fatales. The pair of Hudson and Mallet has been seen as representing the two sides of James&#x27;s own nature: the wildly imaginative artist and the brooding conscientious mentor.

In &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot; (1881), James concluded the first phase of his career with a novel that remains his most popular piece of long fiction. The story is of a spirited young American woman, Isabel Archer, who &quot;affronts her destiny&quot; and finds it overwhelming. She inherits a large amount of money and subsequently becomes the victim of Machiavellian scheming by two American expatriates. The narrative is set mainly in Europe, especially in England and Italy. Generally regarded as the masterpiece of his early phase, &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot; is described as a psychological novel, exploring the minds of his characters, and almost a work of social science, exploring the differences between Europeans and Americans, the old and the new worlds.

The second period of James&#x27;s career, which extends from the publication of &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot; through the end of the 19th century, features less popular novels, including &quot;The Princess Casamassima&quot;, published serially in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; in 1885–1886, and &quot;The Bostonians&quot;, published serially in &quot;The Century&quot; during the same period. This period also featured James&#x27;s celebrated Gothic novella, &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; (1898).

The third period of James&#x27;s career reached its most significant achievement in three novels published just around the start of the 20th century: &quot;The Wings of the Dove&quot; (1902), &quot;The Ambassadors&quot; (1903), and &quot;The Golden Bowl&quot; (1904). Critic F. O. Matthiessen called this &quot;trilogy&quot; James&#x27;s major phase, and these novels have certainly received intense critical study. The second-written of the books, &quot;The Wings of the Dove&quot;, was the first published because it was not serialised. This novel tells the story of Milly Theale, an American heiress stricken with a serious disease, and her impact on the people around her. Some of these people befriend Milly with honourable motives, while others are more self-interested. James stated in his autobiographical books that Milly was based on Minny Temple, his beloved cousin, who died at an early age of tuberculosis. He said that he attempted in the novel to wrap her memory in the &quot;beauty and dignity of art&quot;.

===Shorter narratives===

James was particularly interested in what he called the &quot;beautiful and blest &quot;nouvelle&quot;&quot;, or the longer form of short narrative. Still, he produced a number of very short stories in which he achieved notable compression of sometimes complex subjects. The following narratives are representative of James&#x27;s achievement in the shorter forms of fiction.

* &quot;Daisy Miller&quot; (1878), novella
* &quot;The Aspern Papers&quot; (1888), novella
* &quot;The Lesson of the Master&quot; (1888), novella

===Plays===

At several points in his career, James wrote plays, beginning with one-act plays written for periodicals in 1869 and 1871 and a dramatisation of his popular novella &quot;Daisy Miller&quot; in 1882. From 1890 to 1892, having received a bequest that freed him from magazine publication, he made a strenuous effort to succeed on the London stage, writing a half-dozen plays, of which only one, a dramatisation of his novel &quot;The American&quot;, was produced. This play was performed for several years by a touring repertory company, and had a respectable run in London, but did not earn very much money for James. His other plays written at this time were not produced.

In 1893, however, he responded to a request from actor-manager George Alexander for a serious play for the opening of his renovated St. James&#x27;s Theatre, and wrote a long drama, &quot;Guy Domville&quot;, which Alexander produced. A noisy uproar arose on the opening night, 5 January 1895, with hissing from the gallery when James took his bow after the final curtain, and the author was upset. The play received moderately good reviews and had a modest run of four weeks before being taken off to make way for Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;, which Alexander thought would have better prospects for the coming season.

After the stresses and disappointment of these efforts, James insisted that he would write no more for the theatre, but within weeks had agreed to write a curtain-raiser for Ellen Terry. This became the one-act &quot;Summersoft&quot;, which he later rewrote into a short story, &quot;Covering End&quot;, and then expanded into a full-length play, &quot;The High Bid&quot;, which had a brief run in London in 1907, when James made another concerted effort to write for the stage. He wrote three new plays, two of which were in production when the death of Edward VII on 6 May 1910 plunged London into mourning and theatres closed. Discouraged by failing health and the stresses of theatrical work, James did not renew his efforts in the theatre, but recycled his plays as successful novels. &quot;The Outcry&quot; was a best-seller in the United States when it was published in 1911. During 1890–1893, when he was most engaged with the theatre, James wrote a good deal of theatrical criticism, and assisted Elizabeth Robins and others in translating and producing Henrik Ibsen for the first time in London.

Leon Edel argued in his psychoanalytic biography that James was traumatised by the opening-night uproar that greeted &quot;Guy Domville&quot;, and that it plunged him into a prolonged depression. The successful later novels, in Edel&#x27;s view, were the result of a kind of self-analysis, expressed in fiction, which partly freed him from his fears. Other biographers and scholars have not accepted this account, with the more common view being that of F.O. Matthiessen, who wrote: &quot;Instead of being crushed by the collapse of his hopes [for the theatre]... he felt a resurgence of new energy.&quot;

===Nonfiction===
Beyond his fiction, James was one of the more important literary critics in the history of the novel. In his classic essay &quot;The Art of Fiction&quot; (1884), he argued against rigid prescriptions on the novelist&#x27;s choice of subject and method of treatment. He maintained that the widest possible freedom in content and approach would help ensure narrative fiction&#x27;s continued vitality. James wrote many critical articles on other novelists; typical is his book-length study of Nathaniel Hawthorne, which has been the subject of critical debate. Richard Brodhead has suggested that the study was emblematic of James&#x27;s struggle with Hawthorne&#x27;s influence, and constituted an effort to place the elder writer &quot;at a disadvantage.&quot; Gordon Fraser, meanwhile, has suggested that the study was part of a more commercial effort by James to introduce himself to British readers as Hawthorne&#x27;s natural successor.

When James assembled the &quot;New York Edition&quot; of his fiction in his final years, he wrote a series of prefaces that subjected his own work to searching, occasionally harsh criticism.
At 22, James wrote &quot;The Noble School of Fiction&quot; for &quot;The Nation&quot;″s first issue in 1865. He wrote, in all, over 200 essays and book, art, and theatre reviews for the magazine.

For most of his life, James harboured ambitions for success as a playwright. He converted his novel &quot;The American&quot; into a play that enjoyed modest returns in the early 1890s. In all, he wrote about a dozen plays, most of which went unproduced. His costume drama &quot;Guy Domville&quot; failed disastrously on its opening night in 1895. James then largely abandoned his efforts to conquer the stage and returned to his fiction. In his &quot;Notebooks&quot;, he maintained that his theatrical experiment benefited his novels and tales by helping him dramatise his characters&#x27; thoughts and emotions. James produced a small amount of theatrical criticism, including appreciations of Henrik Ibsen.

With his wide-ranging artistic interests, James occasionally wrote on the visual arts. He wrote a favourable assessment of fellow expatriate John Singer Sargent, a painter whose critical status has improved markedly since the mid twentieth century. James also wrote sometimes charming, sometimes brooding articles about various places where he visited and lived. His books of travel writing include &quot;Italian Hours&quot; (an example of the charming approach) and &quot;The American Scene&quot; (on the brooding side).

James was one of the great letter-writers of any era. More than 10,000 of his personal letters are extant, and over 3,000 have been published in a large number of collections. A complete edition of James&#x27;s letters began publication in 2006, edited by Pierre Walker and Greg Zacharias. , eight volumes have been published, covering from 1855 to 1880. James&#x27;s correspondents included contemporaries such as Robert Louis Stevenson, Edith Wharton, and Joseph Conrad, along with many others in his wide circle of friends and acquaintances. The content of the letters range from trivialities to serious discussions of artistic, social, and personal issues.

Very late in life, James began a series of autobiographical works: &quot;A Small Boy and Others&quot;, &quot;Notes of a Son and Brother&quot;, and the unfinished &quot;The Middle Years&quot;. These books portray the development of a classic observer who was passionately interested in artistic creation but was somewhat reticent about participating fully in the life around him.

==Reception==
===Criticism, biographies and fictional treatments===

James&#x27;s work has remained steadily popular with the limited audience of educated readers to whom he spoke during his lifetime, and has remained firmly in the canon, but after his death, some American critics, such as Van Wyck Brooks, expressed hostility towards James for his long expatriation and eventual naturalisation as a British subject. Other critics such as E. M. Forster complained about what they saw as James&#x27;s squeamishness in the treatment of sex and other possibly controversial material, or dismissed his late style as difficult and obscure, relying heavily on extremely long sentences and excessively latinate language. &#x27;Even in his lifetime,&#x27; explains scholar Hazel Hutchinson, &#x27;James had a reputation as a difficult writer for clever readers.&#x27; Oscar Wilde criticised him for writing &quot;fiction as if it were a painful duty&quot;. Vernon Parrington, composing a canon of American literature, condemned James for having cut himself off from America. Jorge Luis Borges wrote about him, &quot;Despite the scruples and delicate complexities of James, his work suffers from a major defect: the absence of life.&quot; And Virginia Woolf, writing to Lytton Strachey, asked, &quot;Please tell me what you find in Henry James. ... we have his works here, and I read, and I can&#x27;t find anything but faintly tinged rose water, urbane and sleek, but vulgar and pale as Walter Lamb. Is there really any sense in it?&quot; Novelist W. Somerset Maugham wrote, &quot;He did not know the English as an Englishman instinctively knows them and so his English characters never to my mind quite ring true,&quot; and argued, &quot;The great novelists, even in seclusion, have lived life passionately. Henry James was content to observe it from a window.&quot; Maugham nevertheless wrote, &quot;The fact remains that those last novels of his, notwithstanding their unreality, make all other novels, except the very best, unreadable.&quot; Colm Tóibín observed that James &quot;never really wrote about the English very well. His English characters don&#x27;t work for me.&quot;

Despite these criticisms, James is now valued for his psychological and moral realism, his masterful creation of character, his low-key but playful humour, and his assured command of the language. In his 1983 book, &quot;The Novels of Henry James&quot;, Edward Wagenknecht offers an assessment that echoes Theodora Bosanquet&#x27;s:

William Dean Howells saw James as a representative of a new realist school of literary art, which broke with the English romantic tradition epitomised by the works of Charles Dickens and William Thackeray. Howells wrote that realism found &quot;its chief exemplar in Mr. James ... A novelist he is not, after the old fashion, or after any fashion but his own.&quot; F. R. Leavis championed Henry James as a novelist of &quot;established pre-eminence&quot; in &quot;The Great Tradition&quot; (1948), asserting that &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot; and &quot;The Bostonians&quot; were &quot;the two most brilliant novels in the language.&quot; James is now prized as a master of point of view who moved literary fiction forward by insisting in showing, not telling, his stories to the reader.

<text>In Greek mythology, Thaumas or Thaumant (; ; ) was a sea god, son of Pontus and Gaia, and the full brother of Nereus, Phorcys, Ceto and Eurybia.

==Mythology==
According to Hesiod, Thaumas&#x27;s wife was Electra (one of the Oceanids, the many daughters of the Titans Oceanus and Tethys), by whom he fathered Iris (the messenger of the gods), Arke (formerly the messenger of the Titans), and the Harpies.

The names of Thaumas&#x27;s Harpy daughters vary. Hesiod and Apollodorus name them: Aello and Ocypete. Virgil, names Celaeno as one of the Harpies. However, while Hyginus, &quot;Fabulae&quot; Preface has the Harpies, Celaeno, Ocypete, and Podarce, as daughters of Thaumas and Electra, at &quot;Fabulae&quot; 14.18, the Harpies are said to be named Aellopous, Celaeno, and Ocypete, and are the daughters of Thaumas and Ozomene.

The 5th-century poet Nonnus gives Thaumas and Electra two children, Iris, and the river Hydaspes.

Plato associates Thaumas&#x27;s name with &quot;θαῦμα&quot; (&quot;wonder&quot;).

Thaumas was also the name of a centaur, who fought against the Lapiths at the Centauromachy.

<doc id="83124" wikidata="Q5976" url="?curid=83124" title="Black dwarf">
<text>A black dwarf is a theoretical stellar remnant, specifically a white dwarf that has cooled sufficiently to no longer emit significant heat or light. Because the time required for a white dwarf to reach this state is calculated to be longer than the current age of the universe (13.8 billion years), no black dwarfs are expected to exist in the universe at the present time. The temperature of the coolest white dwarfs is one observational limit on the universe&#x27;s age.

The name &quot;black dwarf&quot; has also been applied to hypothetical late-stage cooled brown dwarfs substellar objects with insufficient mass (less than approximately 0.07 ) to maintain hydrogen-burning nuclear fusion.

==Formation==
A white dwarf is what remains of a main sequence star of low or medium mass (below approximately 9 to 10 solar masses ()) after it has either expelled or fused all the elements for which it has sufficient temperature to fuse. What is left is then a dense sphere of electron-degenerate matter that cools slowly by thermal radiation, eventually becoming a black dwarf. 

If black dwarfs were to exist, they would be challenging to detect because, by definition, they would emit very little radiation. They would, however, be detectable through their gravitational influence. Various white dwarfs cooled below (equivalent to M0 spectral class) were found in 2012 by astronomers using MDM Observatory&#x27;s 2.4 meter telescope. They are estimated to be 11 to 12 billion years old.

Because the far-future evolution of stars depends on physical questions which are poorly understood, such as the nature of dark matter and the possibility and rate of proton decay (which is yet to be proven to exist), it is not known precisely how long it would take white dwarfs to cool to blackness. Barrow and Tipler estimate that it would take 1015 years for a white dwarf to cool to ; however, if weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) exist, interactions with these particles may keep some white dwarfs much warmer than this for approximately 1025 years. If protons are not stable, white dwarfs will also be kept warm by energy released from proton decay. For a hypothetical proton lifetime of 1037 years, Adams and Laughlin calculate that proton decay will raise the effective surface temperature of an old one-solar-mass white dwarf to approximately . Although cold, this is thought to be hotter than the cosmic microwave background radiation temperature 1037 years in the future.

It is speculated that some massive black dwarfs may eventually produce supernova explosions. These will occur if pycnonuclear (density-based) fusion processes much of the star to nickel-56, which decays into iron via emitting a positron. This would lower the Chandrasekhar limit for some black dwarfs below their actual mass. If this point is reached, it would then collapse and initiate runaway nuclear fusion. The most massive to explode would be just below the Chandrasekhar limit at around 1.41 solar masses and would take of the order of , while the least massive to explode would be about 1.16 solar masses and would take of the order , totaling around 1% of all black dwarfs. One major caveat is that proton decay would decrease the mass of a black dwarf far more rapidly than pycnonuclear processes occur, preventing any supernova explosions.

==Future of the Sun==
Once the Sun stops fusing helium in its core and ejects its layers in a planetary nebula in about 8 billion years, it will become a white dwarf and also, over trillions of years, eventually will no longer emit any light. After that, the Sun will not be visible to the equivalent of the naked human eye, removing it from optical view even if the gravitational effects are evident. The estimated time for the Sun to cool enough to become a black dwarf is at least 1015 (1 quadrillion) years, though it could take much longer than this, if weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) exist, as described above. The described phenomena are considered a promising method of verification for the existence of WIMPs and black dwarfs.

<text>In Greek mythology, Iodame or Iodama (; Ancient Greek: or probably means &#x27;heifer calf of Io&#x27;) was a Thessalian princess as the daughter of King Itonus of Iton in Phthiotis. She was the granddaughter of Amphictyon.

== Family ==
Iodame was the mother of Thebe by Zeus while some authors, adds a son, Deucalion.

== Mythology ==
Iodame was a priestess at the temple of Athena Itonia built by her father. When she trespassed the precinct one night, Athena appeared in front of her; at the sight of Medusa&#x27;s head which was worked in the goddess&#x27; garment, Iodame turned into a block of stone. After this, a priestess lit the fire on the altar every day, repeating thrice: &quot;Iodame lives and demands fire&quot;.

An alternate story of Athene and Iodama relates that both were daughters of Itonius. They became jealous of each other and started fighting, which resulted in Iodame being killed by Athena. The story is similar to that of Athena and Pallas (daughter of Triton).

<text>Ogyges, also spelled Ogygus (Ancient Greek: ), is a primeval mythological ruler in ancient Greece, generally of Boeotia, but an alternative tradition makes him the first king of Attica.

==Etymology==
Though the original etymology and meaning are &quot;uncertain&quot;, the name &quot;Ogyges&quot; may be related to the Greek Okeanos (Ὠκεανός), the Titan who personified the great world ocean. The Greek word &quot;Ogygios&quot; (Ὠγύγιος), meaning &quot;Ogygian&quot;, came to mean &quot;primeval, primal,&quot; or &quot;from earliest ages&quot; and also &quot;gigantic&quot;.

== Family ==
Stories of Ogyges&#x27;s descent differs widely. Besides Ogyges being one of the aborigines of Boeotia, there are tales that regard him as the son of Poseidon (by Alistra), Boeotus or even Cadmus. Theophilus, in the 2nd century (&quot;Apologia ad Autolycum&quot;), says he was one of the Titans.

Ogyges was the husband of Thebe, from whom the land of Thebes in Greece is said to derive its name. His children are listed variously as two sons: Eleusinus (for whom the city Eleusis was named) and Cadmus (noted above as his father in other traditions); and three daughters: Aulis, Alalcomenia, and Thelxinia.

==Mythology==

=== Reign ===
Ogyges is also known as king of the Ectenes, who according to Pausanias were the first inhabitants of Boeotia, where the city of Thebes would later be founded. As such, he became the first ruler of Thebes, which was, in that early time, named &quot;Ogygia&quot; (Ὠγυγία) after him. Subsequently, poets referred to the Thebans as &quot;Ogygidae&quot; (Ὠγυγίδαι). Pausanias, writing from his travels in Boeotia in the 2nd century CE, said: &quot;The first to occupy the land of Thebes are said to have been the Ectenes, whose king was Ogygus, an aboriginal. From his name is derived Ogygian, which is an epithet of Thebes used by most of the poets.&quot;

In yet another version of the story, the Boeotian tradition is combined with that of another part of Greece: Ogyges was king of the Ectenes, who were the first people to occupy Boeotia, but he and his people later settled the area then known as Acte (&quot;Akte&quot;). The land was subsequently called Ogygia in his honor but later known as Mount Athos. Sextus Julius Africanus, writing after 221 CE, adds that Ogyges founded Eleusis. In one account, his predecessor was called Kalydnos, son of Ouranos.

According to Africanus, Ogygus lived at the time of the Exodus of the House of Israel from Egypt.

Ogyges is possibly the namesake for the phantom island Ogygia, mentioned in Homer&#x27;s Odyssey. A long-standing tradition begun by Euhemerus in the late 4th century BC and supported by Callimachus, endorsed by modern Maltese tradition, identifies Ogygia with the island of Gozo, the second largest island in the Maltese archipelago. Another possibility for the island is the Niobid named Ogygia.

The historian Josephus mentions Ogyges as the name of the oak by which the Hebrew patriarch Abram dwelt while he lived near Hebron. Furthermore, Og, also called &quot;Ogias the Giant&quot;, who was king of Bashan in the Old Testament; was described as a giant in Deut 3:11, viewed by the Hebrews as having aided Noah in building the Ark, thus Noah allowed him to stay on the deck of the Ark.

===The deluge of Ogyges===

The first worldwide flood in Greek mythology, the Ogygian deluge occurred during his reign and derives its name from him, though some sources regard it as a local flood, such as an inundation of Lake Copais, a large lake once in the center of Boeotia. Other sources see it as a flood associated with Attica. This latter view was accepted by Africanus, who says &quot;that great and first flood occurred in Attica, when Phoroneus was king of Argos, as Acusilaus relates.&quot;

When this deluge has been considered global, a similarity is noticed with Noah&#x27;s flood in the Bible. Various dates have been assigned to the event, including 2136 BCE (Varro), and 1793 BCE (Africanus).

Ogyges survived the deluge but many people perished. After his death, the devastated Attica was without kings for 189 years, until the time of Cecrops (Cecrops Diphyes). Africanus says, &quot;But after Ogyges, on account of the great destruction caused by the flood, what is now called Attica remained without a king one hundred and eighty-nine years until the time of Cecrops. For Philochorus asserts that that Actaeon who comes after Ogyges, and the fictitious names, never even existed.&quot;

It seems the deluge of Deucalion of Greek-mythology is the Greek version of the older legend. Deucalion and Pyrrha were the only survivors after the great deluge. Their son Hellen, who became ruler of Phthia in southern Thessaly, was the patriarch of the Hellenes.

<text>Jørgen Mohr (Latinised &quot;Georg(ius) Mohr&quot;; 1 April 1640 – 26 January 1697) was a Danish mathematician, known for being the first to prove the Mohr–Mascheroni theorem, which states that any geometric construction which can be done with compass and straightedge can also be done with compasses alone.

==Biography==
Mohr was born in Copenhagen, the son of a tradesman named David Mohrendal. Beginning in 1662 he traveled to the Netherlands, to study mathematics with Christiaan Huygens. In 1672 he published his first book, &quot;Euclides Danicus&quot;, simultaneously in Copenhagen and Amsterdam, in Danish and Dutch respectively. This book, proving the Mohr–Mascheroni theorem 125 years earlier than Lorenzo Mascheroni, would languish in obscurity until its rediscovery in 1928. Mohr served in Franco-Dutch War in 1672–1673, and was taken prisoner by the French. By 1673, he had published his second book, &quot;Compendium Euclidis Curiosi&quot;. A third book was later mentioned by Mohr&#x27;s son; for many years this was believed to be the &quot;Gegenübung auf Compendium Euclidis Curiosi&quot; but argue that it must be a different book, and that the &quot;Gegenübung&quot; has a different author. As well as his work on geometry, Mohr contributed to the theory of nested radicals, with the aim of simplifying Cardano&#x27;s formula for the roots of a cubic polynomial.

While in the Netherlands, Mohr became a friend of Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus. The two visited Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in France and John Collins in England together. Mohr returned to Denmark in 1681; he had dedicated &quot;Euclides Danicus&quot; to Christian V and hoped for a position in exchange, but was offered only a position as a shipyard supervisor, which he declined. He married Elizabeth von der Linde of Copenhagen on 19 July 1687, and soon after returned to Holland; their son, Peter Georg Mohrenthal, eventually settled in Dresden as a bookseller and publisher. In 1695 he took a job with Tschirnhaus, and spent his last few years as a guest in Tschirnhaus&#x27;s house. He died in Kieslingswalde near Görlitz, Germany.

The Georg Mohr competition, which is used to select Danish participants to the International Mathematical Olympiad, is named after Mohr.

<text>Theia (; , also rendered Thea or Thia), also called Euryphaessa (, &quot;wide-shining&quot;), is one of the twelve Titans, the children of the earth goddess Gaia and the sky god Uranus in Greek mythology. She is the Greek goddess of sight and vision, and by extension the goddess who endowed gold, silver, and gems with their brilliance and intrinsic value.

Her brother-consort is Hyperion, a Titan and god of the sun, and together they are the parents of Helios (the Sun), Selene (the Moon), and Eos (the Dawn). She seems to be the same figure as Aethra, who is the consort of Hyperion and mother of his children in some accounts. Like her husband, Theia features scarcely in myth, being mostly important for the children she bore, though she appears in some texts and rare traditions.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Theia&quot; alone means simply &quot;goddess&quot; or &quot;divine&quot;; &quot;Theia Euryphaessa&quot; () brings overtones of extent (, &quot;eurys&quot;, &quot;wide&quot;, root: ) and brightness (, &quot;phaos&quot;, &quot;light&quot;, root: φαεσ-).

== Family ==
Early accounts gave her a primal origin, said to be the eldest daughter of Gaia (Earth) and Uranus (Sky). She is thus the sister of the Titans (Oceanus, Crius, Hyperion, Iapetus, Coeus, Themis, Rhea, Phoebe, Tethys, Mnemosyne, Cronus, and sometimes of Dione), the Cyclopes, the Hecatoncheires, the Giants, the Meliae, the Erinyes, and is the half-sister of Aphrodite (in some versions), Typhon, Python, Pontus, Thaumas, Phorcys, Nereus, Eurybia, and Ceto. By her brother-husband Hyperion, she is the mother of Helios, Selene, and Eos. 

Robert Graves relates that Theia is referred to as the &quot;cow-eyed Euryphaessa&quot; who gave birth to Helios in myths dating to classical antiquity.

== Mythology ==
Once paired in later myths with her Titan brother Hyperion as her husband, &quot;mild-eyed Euryphaessa, the far-shining one&quot; of the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Helios&quot;, was said to be the mother of Helios (the Sun), Selene (the Moon), and Eos (the Dawn). Gaius Valerius Catullus described those three lights of the heavens as &quot;Theia&#x27;s illustrious progeny&quot; in the sixty-sixth of his &quot;carmina&quot;.

Pindar praises Theia in his Fifth Isthmian ode:

She seems here a goddess of glittering in particular and of glory in general, but Pindar&#x27;s allusion to her as &quot;Theia of many names&quot; is telling, since it suggests assimilation, referring not only to similar mother-of-the-sun goddesses such as Phoebe and Leto, but perhaps also to more universalizing mother-figures such as Rhea and Cybele. Furthermore, a scholium on those lines wrote &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Sun came from Theia and Hyperion, and from the Sun came gold&quot;, denoting a special connection of Theia, the goddess of sight and brilliance, with gold as the mother of Helios the sun. Theia was regarded as the goddess from which all light proceeded.

Plutarch wrote a fable-like story, &quot;The Moon and her Mother&quot; (which is sometimes categorized as an Aesop&#x27;s fable), where Theia&#x27;s daughter Selene asked her mother to weave her a garment to fit her measure; the mother, who goes unnamed, then replied that she was unable to do so, as Selene kept changing shape and size, sometimes full, then crescent-shaped and others yet half her size, never staying the same.

According to sixth century BC lyric poet Stesichorus, Theia lives with her son in his palace. In the east Gigantomachy frieze of the Pergamon Altar, the figure of the goddess preserved fighting a youthful giant next to Helios is conjectured to be his mother Theia.

=== Diodorus&#x27;s account ===
An unorthodox version of the myth presented by Diodorus identified Theia as &quot;Basileia&quot; (&quot;queen&quot;, &quot;royal palace&quot;) with the following account:

: To Uranus were also born daughters, the two eldest of whom were by far the most renowned above all the others and were called Basileia and Rhea, whom some also named Pandora. Of these daughters Basileia, who was the eldest and far excelled the others in both prudence and understanding, reared all her brothers, showing them collectively a mother&#x27;s kindness; consequently she was given the appellation of &#x27;Great Mother&#x27;; and after her father had been translated from among men into the circle of the gods, with the approval of the masses and of her brothers she succeeded to the royal dignity, though she was still a maiden and because of her exceedingly great chastity had been unwilling to unite in marriage with any man. But later, because of her desire to leave sons who should succeed to the throne, she united in marriage with Hyperion, one of her brothers, for whom she had the greatest affection. And when there were born to her two children, Helios and Selene, who were greatly admired for both their beauty and their chastity, the brothers of Basileia, they say, being envious of her because of her happy issue of children and fearing that Hyperion would divert the royal power to himself, committed an utterly impious deed; for entering into a conspiracy among themselves they put Hyperion to the sword, and casting Helius, who was still in years a child, into the Eridanus river, drowned him. When this crime came to light, Selene, who loved her brother very greatly, threw herself down from the roof, but as for his mother, while seeking his body along the river, her strength left her and falling into a swoon she beheld a vision in which she thought that Helius stood over her and urged her not to mourn the death of her children; for, he said, the Titans would meet the punishment which they deserve, while he and his sister would be transformed, by some divine providence, into immortal natures, since that which had formerly been called the &#x27;holy fire&#x27; in the heavens would be called by men Helius (&#x27;the sun&#x27;) and that addressed as &#x27;mene&#x27; would be called Selene (&#x27;the moon&#x27;). When she was aroused from the swoon she recounted to the common crowd both the dream and the misfortunes which had befallen her, asking that they render to the dead honours like those accorded to the gods and asserting that no man should thereafter touch her body. And after this she became frenzied, and seizing such of her daughter&#x27;s playthings as could make a noise, she began to wander over the land, with her hair hanging free, inspired by the noise of the kettledrums and cymbals, so that those who saw her were struck with astonishment. And all men were filled with pity at her misfortune and some were clinging to her body, when there came a mighty storm and continuous crashes of thunder and lightning; and in the midst of this Basileia passed from sight, whereupon the crowds of people, amazed at this reversal of fortune, transferred the names and the honours of Helios and Selene to the stars of the sky, and as for their mother, they considered her to be a goddess and erected altars to her, and imitating the incidents of her life by the pounding of the kettledrums and the clash of the cymbals they rendered unto her in this way sacrifices and all other honours.

== Theia in the sciences ==

Theia&#x27;s mythological role as the mother of the Moon goddess Selene is alluded to in the application of the name to a hypothetical planet that, according to the giant impact hypothesis, collided with the Earth and created the Moon, paralleling the mythological Theia&#x27;s role as the mother of Selene.

Theia&#x27;s alternate name &quot;Euryphaessa&quot; has been adopted for a species of Australian leafhoppers &quot;Dayus euryphaessa&quot; (Kirkaldy, 1907).

A Theia figure has been found at the Necropolis of Cyrene.

<text>The Thriae (; ) were nymphs, three virginal sisters, one of a number of such triads in Greek mythology. They were named &quot;Melaina&quot; (&quot;The Black&quot;), &quot;Kleodora&quot; (&quot;Famed for her Gift&quot;), and &quot;Daphnis&quot; (&quot;Laurel&quot;) or &quot;Corycia&quot;.
== Mythology ==
They were the three Naiads (nymphs) of the sacred springs of the Corycian Cave of Mount Parnassus in Phocis, and the patrons of bees. The nymphs had women&#x27;s heads and torsos and lower body and wings of a bee.

The nymph sisters were romantically linked to the gods Apollo and Poseidon; Corycia, the sister after whom the Corycian Cave was named, was the mother of Lycoreus with Apollo, Kleodora was loved by Poseidon, and was the mother by him (or Kleopompos) of Parnassos (who founded the city of Parnassus) while Melaina was also loved by Apollo, and bore him Delphos (although another tradition names Thyia as the mother of Delphos). Her name, meaning &quot;the black,&quot; suggests that she presided over subterranean nymphs.

These three bee maidens with the power of divination and thus speaking truth are described in the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Hermes&quot;, and the food of the gods is &quot;identified as honey&quot;; the bee maidens were originally associated with Apollo, and are probably not correctly identified with the Thriae. Both the Thriae and the Bee Maidens are credited with assisting Apollo in developing his adult powers, but the divination that Apollo learned from the Thriae differs from that of the Bee Maidens. The type of divination taught by the Thriae to Apollo was that of mantic pebbles, the throwing of stones, rather than the type of divination associated with the Bee Maidens and Hermes: cleromancy, the casting of lots. 
Honey, according to a Greek myth, was discovered by a nymph called Melissa (&quot;Bee&quot;); and honey was offered to the Greek gods from Mycenean times. Bees were associated, too, with the Delphic oracle and the prophetess was sometimes called a bee.

<doc id="83133" wikidata="Q536850" url="?curid=83133" title="Thyrsus">
<text>In Ancient Greece a thyrsus () or thyrsos (; ) was a wand or staff of giant fennel (&quot;Ferula communis&quot;) covered with ivy vines and leaves, sometimes wound with &quot;taeniae&quot; and topped with a pine cone, artichoke, fennel, or by a bunch of vine-leaves and grapes or ivy-leaves and berries, carried during Hellenic festivals and religious ceremonies. The &quot;thyrsus&quot; is typically associated with the Greek god Dionysus (and his subsequent Roman equivalent Bacchus) as a symbol of prosperity, fertility, and hedonism.

== Religious and ceremonial use ==
In Greek religion, the staff was carried by the devotees of Dionysus. Euripides wrote that honey dripped from the &quot;thyrsos&quot; staves that the Bacchic maenads carried. The &quot;thyrsus&quot; was a sacred instrument at religious rituals and fêtes.

The fabulous history of Bacchus relates that he converted the &quot;thyrsi&quot; carried by himself and his followers into dangerous weapons, by concealing an iron point in the head of leaves. Hence his &quot;thyrsus&quot; is called &quot;a spear enveloped in vine-leaves&quot;, and its point was thought to incite to madness.

== Symbolism ==
The &quot;thyrsus&quot;, associated with the followers of Dionysus (the satyrs, &quot;thiasus&quot;, and maenads or Bacchantes), is a symbol of prosperity, fertility, hedonism, and pleasure/enjoyment in general. The &quot;thyrsus&quot; was tossed in the Bacchic dance:
&quot;Pentheus&quot;: The &quot;thyrsus&quot;—in my right hand shall I hold it?
::Or thus am I more like a Bacchanal?
&quot;Dionysus&quot;: In thy right hand, and with thy right foot raise it.
Sometimes the &quot;thyrsus&quot; was displayed in conjunction with a &quot;kantharos&quot; wine cup, another symbol of Dionysus, forming a male-and-female combination.

== Literature ==

In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Diomedes, one of the leading warriors of the Achaeans, mentions the &quot;thyrsus&quot; while speaking to Glaucus, one of the Lycian commanders in the Trojan army, about Lycurgus, the king of Scyros:
He it was that/drove the nursing women who were in charge/of frenzied Bacchus through the land of Nysa,/and they flung their &quot;thyrsi&quot; on the ground as/murderous Lycurgus beat them with his oxgoad. The &quot;thyrsus&quot; is explicitly attributed to Dionysus and his followers in Euripides&#x27;s play, &quot;The Bacchae,&quot; a Greek tragedy describing the degradation of Thebes in vindication for the sullied name of Dionysus&#x27;s mortal mother. The story surrounds the murder of the young king and indoctrination of all of the Theban women into Dionysus&#x27;s cult, with the &quot;thyrsus&quot; serving as a badge of sorts for members.
To raise my Bacchic shout, and clothe all who respond/ In fawnskin habits, and put my &quot;thyrsus&quot; in their hands–/ The weapon wreathed with ivy-shoots... Euripides also writes, &quot;There&#x27;s a brute wildness in the fennel-wands—Reverence it well.&quot;Plato describes the hedonistic connotation of the &quot;thyrsus&quot;, and thereby Dionysus, in his philosophical &quot;Phaedo&quot;:
I conceive that the founders of the mysteries had a real meaning and were not mere triflers when they intimated in a figure long ago that he who passes unsanctified and uninitiated into the world below will live in a slough, but that he who arrives there after initiation and purification will dwell with the gods. For &#x27;many&#x27;, as they say in the mysteries, &#x27;are the &quot;thyrsus&quot; bearers, but few are the mystics&#x27;, – meaning, as I interpret the words, the true philosophers.In Part II of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;, Mephistopheles tries to catch a Lamia, only to find out that she is an illusion and instead holds a &quot;thyrsus&quot;. The play contains major themes of sin and hedonism, and makes connection to Dionysus through the &quot;thyrsus&quot;:
Well, then, a tall one I will catch... And now a &quot;thyrsus&quot;-pole I snatch! Only a pine-cone as its head.Robert Browning mentions the &quot;thyrsus&quot; in passing in &quot;The Bishop Orders His Tomb at St Praxed&#x27;s Church&quot;, as the dying bishop confuses Christian piety with classical extravagance. Ovid talks about Bacchus carrying a &quot;thyrsus&quot; and his followers doing the same in his Metamorphoses Book III, which is a retelling of The Bacchae.
The bas-relief in bronze ye promised me,/Those Pans and nymphs ye wot of, and perchance/Some tripod, &quot;thyrsus&quot;, with a vase or so.

<text>Zalmoxis () also known as Salmoxis (Σάλμοξις), Zalmoxes (Ζάλμοξες), Zamolxis (Ζάμολξις), Samolxis (Σάμολξις), Zamolxes (Ζάμολξες), or Zamolxe (Ζάμολξε) is a divinity of the Getae and Dacians (a people of the lower Danube), mentioned by Herodotus in his &quot;Histories&quot; Book IV, 93–96, written before 425 BC.

Said to have been so called from the bear&#x27;s skin (ζάλμος) in which he was clothed as soon as he was born.

According to Jordanes&#x27; &quot;Getica&quot;, he was a learned philosopher, before whom two other learned men existed, by the names of Zeuta and Deceneus.

==Herodotus==
Herodotus writes about Zalmoxis in book 4 of his &quot;Histories&quot;:
93. ... the Getae are the bravest of the Thracians and the most just. 
94. They believe they are immortal forever living in the following sense: they think they do not die and that the one who dies joins Zalmoxis, a divine being; some call this same divine being Gebeleizis. Every four years, they send a messenger to Zalmoxis, who is chosen by chance. They ask him to tell Zalmoxis what they want on that occasion. The mission is performed in the following way: men standing there for that purpose hold three spears; other people take the one who is sent to Zalmoxis by his hands and feet and fling him in the air on the spears. If he dies pierced, they think that the divinity is going to help them; if he does not die, it is he who is accused and they declare that he is a bad person. And, after he has been charged, they send another one. The messenger is told the requests while he is still alive. The same Thracians, on other occasions, when he thunders and lightens, shoot with arrows up in the air against the sky and menace the divinity because they think there is no god other than their own. 

Herodotus asserts that Zalmoxis was originally a human being, a slave who converted the Thracians to his beliefs. The Greeks of the Hellespont and the Black Sea tell that Zalmoxis was a slave of Pythagoras, son of Mnesarchos, on the island of Samos. After being liberated, he gathered huge wealth and, once rich, went back to his homeland. Thracians lived simple hard lives. Zalmoxis had lived among the wisest of Greeks, such as Pythagoras, and had been initiated into Ionian life and the Eleusinian Mysteries. He built a banquet hall, and received the chiefs and his fellow countrymen at a banquet. He taught that neither his guests nor their descendants would ever die, but instead would go to a place where they would live forever in complete happiness. He then dug an underground residence. When it was finished, he disappeared from Thrace, living for three years in his underground residence. The Thracians missed him and wept fearing him dead. The fourth year, he came back among them and thus they believed what Zalmoxis had told them.

Zalmoxis may have lived much earlier than Pythagoras and was rumored either to be a divine being or from the country of the Getae.

&quot;Now I neither disbelieve nor entirely believe the tale about Salmoxis and his underground chamber; but I think that he lived many years before Pythagoras; [2] and as to whether there was a man called Salmoxis or this is some deity native to the Getae, let the question be dismissed.&quot; — Herodotus

Scholars have several different theories about this account by Herodotus the disappearance and return of Zalmoxis:
* Herodotus is mocking the barbarian beliefs of the Getae.
* Zalmoxis created a ritual of passage. This theory is mainly supported by Mircea Eliade, who wrote the first coherent interpretation of the myth about Zalmoxis.
* Zalmoxis is related to Pythagoras, stating that he founded a mystical cult. This theory may be found in Eliade&#x27;s work.
* Zalmoxis is a Christ-like figure who dies and is resurrected. This position was defended by Jean (Ioan) Coman, a professor of patristics and Orthodox priest, who was a friend of Mircea Eliade and published in Eliade&#x27;s journal &quot;Zalmoxis&quot;, which appeared in the 1930s.

, given in both &quot;Ynglingsaga&quot; and &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; of Saxo Grammaticus, particularly &quot;Ynglingsaga&quot; 12 and &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;, in which Frode disappears into the earth for three years after his death.

It is difficult to define the time when a cult to Zalmoxis may have existed. It is only certain that it predates Herodotus. Some scholars have suggested that the archaic doctrine of Zalmoxis points to a heritage from before the times of Indo-Europeans, but this is difficult, if not impossible, to demonstrate.

Plato claims that Zalmoxis was also a great physician who took a holistic approach to healing body and soul (psyche), being thus used by Plato for his own philosophical conceptions.

==Religion of the Getae==
Strabo in his &quot;Geography&quot; mentions a certain Deceneus (Dékainéos) whom he calls a &quot;magician&quot;. According to Strabo, king Burebista (82–44 BC) hired Deceneus, who had been in Egypt, to &quot;tame&quot; his people. As a sign of the people&#x27;s obedience, they consented to destroy all their wines as ordered by Deceneus. The &quot;reform of Deceneus&quot; is the interpretation by the 6th-century bishop and historian Jordanes, who includes the Getae in his history of the Goths (as assumed ancestors of the Goths). Jordanes describes how Deceneus taught the Getae philosophy and physics. Even if it is more probable that Jordanes interjected his own philosophical knowledge into the text, many modern Romanian authors consider that Deceneus was a priest who reformed the religion of the Getae, changing the worship of Zalmoxis into a popular religion and imposing strict religious rules, such as the restriction of wine consumption. Jean Coman deems this prohibition as the origin of the dietary restrictions followed by the modern Orthodox Church during Lent.

According to Iamblichus (280-333 AD), &quot;for instructing the Getae in these things, and for having written laws for them, Zalmoxis was by them considered as the greatest of the gods.&quot;

Aristotle is said, in the brief epitome of his &quot;Magicus&quot; given by Diogenes Laertes, to have compared Zalmoxis with the Phoenician Okhon and Libyan Atlas. Some authors assume Zalmoxis was another name of Sabazius, the Thracian Dionysus, or Zeus. Sabazius appears in Jordanes as Gebelezis. Leaving aside the suffixes &quot;-zius/-zis&quot;, the root &quot;Saba-&quot; = &quot;Gebele-&quot;, suggesting a relationship of the name of the goddess Cybele, as &quot;Cybele&#x27;s Zeus&quot;. Mnaseas of Patrae identified Zalmoxis with Cronos, as does Hesychius, who has &quot;&quot;.

In Plato&#x27;s writings, Zalmoxis is mentioned as skilled in the arts of incantation. Zalmoxis gave his name to a particular type of singing and dancing (Hesych). His realm as a god is not very clear, as some considered him to be a sky-god, a god of the dead, or a god of the Mysteries.

==Zalmoxian religion==
The &quot;Zalmoxian religion&quot; is the subject of a scholarly debate that has continued since the beginning of the 20th century. According to some scholars, such as Vasile Pârvan, Jean Coman, R. Pettazzon, E. Rohde and Sorin Paliga, since ancient sources do not mention any god of the Getae other than Zalmoxis, the Getae were monotheistic. However, Herodotus is the only ancient author who explicitly states that the Getae had only one divinity. The sending of a messenger to Zalmoxis and the fact that Getae shot arrows towards the sky have prompted some authors to believe Zalmoxis was a sky god, but his journey into a cavern has led others to suggest that he was a chthonic divinity.

A third group of scholars believe that the Getae, like other Indo-European peoples, were polytheistic. They draw on ancient authors such as Diodorus Siculus, who states that the Getae worshipped Hestia as well as Zalmoxis.

==Etymology==
A number of etymologies have been given for the name. In his &quot;Vita Pythagorae&quot;, Porphyrius (3rd century) says that he was so named because he had been wrapped in a bearskin at birth, and &quot;zalmon&quot; is the Thracian word for &quot;hide&quot; (). Hesychius (ca. 5th century) has () as a Phrygian word for &quot;foreign slave&quot;.

The correct spelling of the name is also uncertain. Manuscripts of Herodotus&#x27; &quot;Historiae&quot; have all four spellings, viz. &quot;Zalmoxis&quot;, &quot;Salmoxis&quot;, &quot;Zamolxis&quot;, &quot;Samolxis&quot;, with a majority of manuscripts favouring &quot;Salmoxis&quot;. Later authors show a preference for &quot;Zamolxis&quot;. Hesychius quotes Herodotus, using &quot;Zalmoxis&quot;.

The &quot;-m-l-&quot; variant (&quot;Zamolxis&quot;) is favoured by those wishing to derive the name from a conjectured Thracian word for &quot;earth&quot;, . Comparisons have also been made with the name of Zemelo and Žemelė, the Phrygian and Lithuanian goddess of the earth, and with the Lithuanian chthonic god Žemeliūkštis. The Lithuanian word &quot;Žalmuo&quot; means &quot;corn shoot&quot; or &quot;fresh grass&quot;. &quot;Žalmokšnis&quot; is another possible form of it.

The &quot;-l-m-&quot; variant is admitted to be the older form and the correct form by the majority of Thracologists, as this is the form found in the older Herodotus manuscripts and other ancient sources. The &quot;-l-m-&quot; form is further attested in Daco-Thracian in &quot;Zalmodegikos&quot;, the name of a Getic King; and in Thracian , &#x27;hide&#x27;, and , &#x27;hide&#x27; (PIE &quot;*kel-&quot;, &#x27;to cover&#x27;; cf. English &quot;helm&quot;).

The other name for Zalmoxis, Gebeleizis, is also spelled Belaizis and Belaixis in Herodotus manuscripts.

<doc id="83136" wikidata="Q1822211" url="?curid=83136" title="Zibelthiurdos">
<text>Zibelthiurdos is a Thracian god of heaven, lightning and rain, whose name is known mainly from epigraphic monuments. The only known reference to this god so far in ancient literature is in Cicero&#x27;s speech against Pizon, where he is mentioned under the name &quot;Jovi Vrii&quot; (&quot;Iuppiter Urius&quot;). According to Cicero, Jupiter Urius had the most ancient and venerated of the barbarian temples, which was sacked by invading armies and resulted in diseases from which those afflicted never recovered.

There is not enough information to draw clear conclusions about his cult, worship, or functions. The preserved images give reason to connect Zibelthiurdos with the ancient Greek God Zeus the Thunderer; he is depicted holding a lightning bolt in his raised right hand, and to his right an eagle with wings spread out. Some scholars consider Thracian Zbelsourdos as an equivalent and partially linguistic cognate of Getic Gebeleizis and Albanian Shurdh, all theonyms used to refer to the Indo-European sky and weather god.

==Names and epigraphy==
In the epigraphic evidence, the deity&#x27;s name is attested in 12 documents, alternatively written as &quot;Zbelthiourdes&quot;, &quot;Zbelthourdos&quot;, &quot;Zbelsourdos&quot; or &quot;Zbersurdos&quot;, &quot;Zbeltiurdus&quot;, &quot;Svelsurdus&quot;.

Orientalist Wilhelm Tomaschek reported three Thracian inscriptions:

* a dedication from Moesia made by a Mucaporis to a Διί Ζβελθιούρδῳ;
* an inscription in Skopia to a DEO ZBELTHIURDO;
* an inscription from Perinthus to a Διί Ζιβελσούρδῳ.

According to epigraphic evidence, the name of Greek god Zeus is found in Thracian inscriptions associated with &quot;Zbelthiurdos&quot; and variations: Zbelturd, Zbelsurd, Zbeltiurd, Zpelturd. This combination is believed to attest a syncretism between the Greek deity and a local Thracian god of thunder and lightning.

==Etymology==
His name speculatively means &quot;Lightning Carrier&quot; or &quot;Thunderer&quot;, but it is uncertain whether Zibelthiurdos is his name or an epithet. Dimitar Detschew supposed that Zbelturdos and variations are epithets of the Thracian reflex of the Proto-Indo-European sky-god &quot;*Dyēus&quot;.

Tomaschek interpreted that &quot;Zibel-&quot; and &quot;Zbel-&quot; were the same word, although he believed the former to be the older form (cf. Thracian king Ζιβέλμιος, or Zibelmios). He also derived &quot;Zbel-&quot; from a Proto-Indo-European stem &quot;*ģʰeib-&quot; &quot;light, lightning&quot;. Also the Getic theonym &quot;Gebeleizis&quot; has been explained as a compound of &quot;gebele&quot; and &quot;zis&quot;; &quot;gebele&quot; probably is from the same PIE root ; &quot;zis&quot; is a reflex of the PIE day-light-sky god *Dyēus, the same as Messapic Zis (cognate and equivalent of the Greek Zeus). The Thracian theonym Zibelthiurdos or Zbelsurdos appears to contain the same PIE root, but with a different phonetic development – &quot;zebele&quot; instead of &quot;gebele&quot;. The second part of the theonym &quot;Zbelsurdos&quot;, &quot;surdos&quot;, has been equated with the Albanian theonym &quot;Shurdh&quot; used in some regions of northern Albania to refer to the weather god, worshiped until the 20th century and presumably preserved since Illyrian times. This term has been interpreted as meaning either &quot;water donor&quot; or &quot;bellow, hum&quot;. 

In another line of scholarship, Dimitar Detschew assumed that the particles &quot;Zber-&quot; and &quot;Zbel-&quot; derived from a Proto-Indo-European stem &quot;*ģwer-&quot; &#x27;briller, éclairer&#x27;. Furthermore, if the second part of the original form of the Thracian theonym was &quot;thiurdos&quot;, &quot;thurdos&quot;, etc. instead of &quot;surdos&quot;, another etymology has been proposed: derived from a stem &quot;*twer&quot;/&quot;*tur&quot; &#x27;to have&#x27;, while &quot;*dho&quot; would indicate a nomen agentis suffix. In this view &quot;Zbelthiurdos&quot; would mean &#x27;he who has the lightning&#x27;.

=== Related words ===
Per Tomaschek, further descendants of &quot;*ģʰeib-&quot; would include Lithuanian &quot;žaibas&quot; &quot;lightning&quot;, verb &quot;žibėti&quot; &quot;to shine, to glow&quot;, and possibly Croatian &quot;zúblja&quot; &quot;torch&quot; and Slovene &quot;zubelj&quot; &quot;flame&quot;. In the same vein, Bulgarian linguist Vladimir I. Georgiev proposed a connection to Lithuanian &quot;Žiburys&quot; &#x27;light, torch&#x27;.

Bulgarian linguist indicated the word &quot;Zbel-&quot; is related to Latvian &quot;zibele&quot; &quot;lightning&quot;.

==Cultic locales==

Zibelthiurdos shrines have been found near the village of Golemo Selo in the Kyustendil Region – an area inhabited by the Thracian Dentellets tribe – as well as near Kapitan Dimitrievo village in the Pazardzhik Province. His image was discovered in a relief from the Esquiline Hill, where he is depicted along with Yambadula (or Iambadoule), a figure of an unclear nature.

At least three inscriptions to deity &quot;Zbeltiurdus&quot; were found in the ancient Dardanian territory: one in Kaçanik, another in Ljubanac (near Skopje), and the third in Dovezenac, near Kumanovë.

<text>Software-defined radio (SDR) is a radio communication system where components that conventionally have been implemented in analog hardware (e.g. mixers, filters, amplifiers, modulators/demodulators, detectors, etc.) are instead implemented by means of software on a computer or embedded system. While the concept of SDR is not new, the rapidly evolving capabilities of digital electronics render practical many processes which were once only theoretically possible.

A basic SDR system may consist of a computer equipped with a sound card, or other analog-to-digital converter, preceded by some form of RF front end. Significant amounts of signal processing are handed over to the general-purpose processor, rather than being done in special-purpose hardware (electronic circuits). Such a design produces a radio which can receive and transmit widely different radio protocols (sometimes referred to as waveforms) based solely on the software used.

Software radios have significant utility for the military and cell phone services, both of which must serve a wide variety of changing radio protocols in real time. In the long term, software-defined radios are expected by proponents like the Wireless Innovation Forum to become the dominant technology in radio communications. SDRs, along with software defined antennas are the enablers of cognitive radio.

== Operating principles ==
Superheterodyne receivers use a VFO (variable-frequency oscillator), mixer, and filter to tune the desired signal to a common IF (intermediate frequency) or baseband. Typically in SDR, this signal is then sampled by the analog-to-digital converter. However, in some applications it is not necessary to tune the signal to an intermediate frequency and the radio frequency signal is directly sampled by the analog-to-digital converter (after amplification).

Real analog-to-digital converters lack the dynamic range to pick up sub-microvolt, nanowatt-power radio signals produced by an antenna. Therefore, a low-noise amplifier must precede the conversion step and this device introduces its own problems. For example, if spurious signals are present (which is typical), these compete with the desired signals within the amplifier&#x27;s dynamic range. They may introduce distortion in the desired signals, or may block them completely. The standard solution is to put band-pass filters between the antenna and the amplifier, but these reduce the radio&#x27;s flexibility. Real software radios often have two or three analog channel filters with different bandwidths that are switched in and out.

The flexibility of SDR allows for dynamic spectrum usage, alleviating the need to statically assign the scarce spectral resources to a single fixed service.

== History ==
In 1970, a researcher at a United States Department of Defense laboratory coined the term &quot;digital receiver&quot;. A laboratory called the Gold Room at TRW in California created a software baseband analysis tool called Midas, which had its operation defined in software.

In 1982, while working under a US Department of Defense contract at RCA, Ulrich L. Rohde&#x27;s department developed the first SDR, which used the COSMAC (Complementary Symmetry Monolithic Array Computer) chip. Rohde was the first to present on this topic with his February 1984 talk, &quot;Digital HF Radio: A Sampling of Techniques&quot; at the Third International Conference on HF Communication Systems and Techniques in London.

In 1984, a team at the Garland, Texas, Division of E-Systems Inc. (now Raytheon) coined the term &quot;software radio&quot; to refer to a digital baseband receiver, as published in their E-Team company newsletter. A &#x27;Software Radio Proof-of-Concept&#x27; laboratory was developed by the E-Systems team that popularized Software Radio within various government agencies. This 1984 Software Radio was a digital baseband receiver that provided programmable interference cancellation and demodulation for broadband signals, typically with thousands of adaptive filter taps, using multiple array processors accessing shared memory.

In 1991, Joe Mitola independently reinvented the term software radio for a plan to build a GSM base station that would combine Ferdensi&#x27;s digital receiver with E-Systems Melpar&#x27;s digitally controlled communications jammers for a true software-based transceiver. E-Systems Melpar sold the software radio idea to the US Air Force. Melpar built a prototype commanders&#x27; tactical terminal in 1990–1991 that employed Texas Instruments TMS320C30 processors and Harris Corporation digital receiver chip sets with digitally synthesized transmission. The Melpar prototype didn&#x27;t last long because when E-Systems ECI Division manufactured the first limited production units, they decided to &quot;throw out those useless C30 boards&quot;, replacing them with conventional RF filtering on transmit and receive and reverting to a digital baseband radio instead of the SpeakEasy like IF ADC/DACs of Mitola&#x27;s prototype. The Air Force would not let Mitola publish the technical details of that prototype, nor would they let Diane Wasserman publish related software life cycle lessons learned because they regarded it as a &quot;USAF competitive advantage&quot;. So instead, with USAF permission, in 1991, Mitola described the architecture principles without implementation details in a paper, &quot;Software Radio: Survey, Critical Analysis and Future Directions&quot; which became the first IEEE publication to employ the term in 1992. When Mitola presented the paper at the conference, Bob Prill of GEC Marconi began his presentation following Mitola with: &quot;Joe is absolutely right about the theory of a software radio and we are building one.&quot; Prill gave a GEC Marconi paper on PAVE PILLAR, a SpeakEasy precursor. SpeakEasy, the military software radio was formulated by Wayne Bonser, then of Rome Air Development Center (RADC), now Rome Labs; by Alan Margulies of MITRE Rome, NY; and then Lt Beth Kaspar, the original DARPA SpeakEasy project manager and by others at Rome including Don Upmal. Although Mitola&#x27;s IEEE publications resulted in the largest global footprint for software radio, Mitola privately credits that DoD lab of the 1970s with its leaders Carl, Dave, and John with inventing the digital receiver technology on which he based software radio once it was possible to transmit via software.

A few months after the National Telesystems Conference 1992, in an E-Systems corporate program review, a vice-president of E-Systems Garland Division objected to Melpar&#x27;s (Mitola&#x27;s) use of the term &quot;software radio&quot; without credit to Garland. Alan Jackson, Melpar VP of marketing at that time, asked the Garland VP if their laboratory or devices included transmitters. The Garland VP said: &quot;No, of course not — ours is a software radio receiver.&quot; Al replied: &quot;Then it&#x27;s a digital receiver but without a transmitter, it&#x27;s not a software radio.&quot; Corporate leadership agreed with Al, so the publication stood. Many amateur radio operators and HF radio engineers had realized the value of digitizing HF at RF and of processing it with Texas Instruments TI C30 digital signal processors (DSPs) and their precursors during the 1980s and early 1990s. Radio engineers at Roke Manor in the UK and at an organization in Germany had recognized the benefits of ADC at the RF in parallel. Mitola&#x27;s publication of software radio in the IEEE opened the concept to the broad community of radio engineers. His May 1995 special issue of the IEEE Communications Magazine with the cover &quot;Software Radio&quot; was regarded as a watershed event with thousands of academic citations. Mitola was introduced by Joao da Silva in 1997 at the First International Conference on Software Radio as &quot;godfather&quot; of software radio in no small part for his willingness to share such a valuable technology &quot;in the public interest&quot;.

Perhaps the first software-based radio transceiver was designed and implemented by Peter Hoeher and Helmuth Lang at the German Aerospace Research Establishment (DLR, formerly DFVLR) in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany, in 1988. Both transmitter and receiver of an adaptive digital satellite modem were implemented according to the principles of a software radio, and a flexible hardware periphery was proposed.

In 1995, Stephen Blust coined the term &quot;software defined radio&quot;, publishing a request for information from Bell South Wireless at the first meeting of the Modular Multifunction Information Transfer Systems (MMITS) forum in 1996 (in 1998 the name was changed to the Software Defined Radio Forum), organized by the USAF and DARPA around the commercialization of their SpeakEasy II program. Mitola objected to Blust&#x27;s term, but finally accepted it as a pragmatic pathway towards the ideal software radio. Although the concept was first implemented with an IF ADC in the early 1990s, software-defined radios have their origins in the U.S. and European defense sectors of the late 1970s (for example, Walter Tuttlebee described a VLF radio that used an ADC and an 8085 microprocessor), about a year after the First International Conference in Brussels. One of the first public software radio initiatives was the U.S. DARPA-Air Force military project named SpeakEasy. The primary goal of the SpeakEasy project was to use programmable processing to emulate more than 10 existing military radios, operating in frequency bands between 2 and 2000 MHz. Another SpeakEasy design goal was to be able to easily incorporate new coding and modulation standards in the future, so that military communications can keep pace with advances in coding and modulation techniques.

In 1997, Blaupunkt introduced the term &quot;DigiCeiver&quot; for their new range of DSP-based tuners with Sharx in car radios such as the Modena &amp; Lausanne RD 148.

=== SpeakEasy phase I ===
From 1990 to 1995, the goal of the SpeakEasy program was to demonstrate a radio for the U.S. Air Force tactical ground air control party that could operate from 2 MHz to 2 GHz, and thus could interoperate with ground force radios (frequency-agile VHF, FM, and SINCGARS), Air Force radios (VHF AM), Naval Radios (VHF AM and HF SSB teleprinters) and satellites (microwave QAM). Some particular goals were to provide a new signal format in two weeks from a standing start, and demonstrate a radio into which multiple contractors could plug parts and software.

The project was demonstrated at TF-XXI Advanced Warfighting Exercise, and demonstrated all of these goals in a non-production radio. There was some discontent with failure of these early software radios to adequately filter out of band emissions, to employ more than the simplest of interoperable modes of the existing radios, and to lose connectivity or crash unexpectedly. Its cryptographic processor could not change context fast enough to keep several radio conversations on the air at once. Its software architecture, though practical enough, bore no resemblance to any other. The SpeakEasy architecture was refined at the MMITS Forum between 1996 and 1999 and inspired the DoD integrated process team (IPT) for programmable modular communications systems (PMCS) to proceed with what became the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS).

The basic arrangement of the radio receiver used an antenna feeding an amplifier and down-converter (see Frequency mixer) feeding an automatic gain control, which fed an analog-to-digital converter that was on a computer VMEbus with a lot of digital signal processors (Texas Instruments C40s). The transmitter had digital-to-analog converters on the PCI bus feeding an up converter (mixer) that led to a power amplifier and antenna. The very wide frequency range was divided into a few sub-bands with different analog radio technologies feeding the same analog to digital converters. This has since become a standard design scheme for wideband software radios.

=== SpeakEasy phase II ===
The goal was to get a more quickly reconfigurable architecture, &quot;i.e.&quot;, several conversations at once, in an &quot;open&quot; software architecture, with cross-channel connectivity (the radio can &quot;bridge&quot; different radio protocols). The secondary goals were to make it smaller, cheaper, and weigh less.

The project produced a demonstration radio only fifteen months into a three-year research project. This demonstration was so successful that further development was halted, and the radio went into production with only a 4 MHz to 400 MHz range.

The software architecture identified standard interfaces for different modules of the radio: &quot;radio frequency control&quot; to manage the analog parts of the radio, &quot;modem control&quot; managed resources for modulation and demodulation schemes (FM, AM, SSB, QAM, etc.), &quot;waveform processing&quot; modules actually performed the modem functions, &quot;key processing&quot; and &quot;cryptographic processing&quot; managed the cryptographic functions, a &quot;multimedia&quot; module did voice processing, a &quot;human interface&quot; provided local or remote controls, there was a &quot;routing&quot; module for network services, and a &quot;control&quot; module to keep it all straight.

The modules are said to communicate without a central operating system. Instead, they send messages over the PCI computer bus to each other with a layered protocol.

As a military project, the radio strongly distinguished &quot;red&quot; (unsecured secret data) and &quot;black&quot; (cryptographically-secured data).

The project was the first known to use FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays) for digital processing of radio data. The time to reprogram these was an issue limiting application of the radio. Today, the time to write a program for an FPGA is still significant, but the time to download a stored FPGA program is around 20 milliseconds. This means an SDR could change transmission protocols and frequencies in one fiftieth of a second, probably not an intolerable interruption for that task.

=== 2000s ===
The SpeakEasy SDR system in the 1994 uses a Texas Instruments TMS320C30 CMOS digital signal processor (DSP), along with several hundred integrated circuit chips, with the radio filling the back of a truck. By the late 2000s, the emergence of RF CMOS technology made it practical to scale down an entire SDR system onto a single mixed-signal system-on-a-chip, which Broadcom demonstrated with the BCM21551 processor in 2007. The Broadcom BCM21551 has practical commercial applications, for use in 3G mobile phones.

== Military usage ==

=== United States ===
The Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) was a program of the US military to produce radios that provide flexible and interoperable communications. Examples of radio terminals that require support include hand-held, vehicular, airborne and dismounted radios, as well as base-stations (fixed and maritime).

This goal is achieved through the use of SDR systems based on an internationally endorsed open Software Communications Architecture (SCA). This standard uses CORBA on POSIX operating systems to coordinate various software modules.

The program is providing a flexible new approach to meet diverse soldier communications needs through software programmable radio technology. All functionality and expandability is built upon the SCA.

The SCA, despite its military origin, is under evaluation by commercial radio vendors for applicability in their domains. The adoption of general-purpose SDR frameworks outside of military, intelligence, experimental and amateur uses, however, is inherently hampered by the fact that civilian users can more easily settle with a fixed architecture, optimized for a specific function, and as such more economical in mass market applications. Still, software defined radio&#x27;s inherent flexibility can yield substantial benefits in the longer run, once the fixed costs of implementing it have gone down enough to overtake the cost of iterated redesign of purpose built systems. This then explains the increasing commercial interest in the technology.

SCA-based infrastructure software and rapid development tools for SDR education and research are provided by the Open Source SCA Implementation Embedded (OSSIE) project. The Wireless Innovation Forum funded the SCA Reference Implementation project, an open source implementation of the SCA specification. (SCARI) can be downloaded for free.

== Amateur and home use ==

A typical amateur software radio uses a direct conversion receiver. Unlike direct conversion receivers of the more distant past, the mixer technologies used are based on the quadrature sampling detector and the quadrature sampling exciter.

The receiver performance of this line of SDRs is directly related to the dynamic range of the analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) utilized. Radio frequency signals are down converted to the audio frequency band, which is sampled by a high performance audio frequency ADC. First generation SDRs used a 44 kHz PC sound card to provide ADC functionality. The newer software defined radios use embedded high performance ADCs that provide higher dynamic range and are more resistant to noise and RF interference.

A fast PC performs the digital signal processing (DSP) operations using software specific for the radio hardware. Several software radio implementations use the open source SDR library DttSP.

The SDR software performs all of the demodulation, filtering (both radio frequency and audio frequency), and signal enhancement (equalization and binaural presentation). Uses include every common amateur modulation: morse code, single-sideband modulation, frequency modulation, amplitude modulation, and a variety of digital modes such as radioteletype, slow-scan television, and packet radio. Amateurs also experiment with new modulation methods: for instance, the DREAM open-source project decodes the COFDM technique used by Digital Radio Mondiale.

There is a broad range of hardware solutions for radio amateurs and home use. There are professional-grade transceiver solutions, e.g. the Zeus ZS-1 or FlexRadio, home-brew solutions, e.g. PicAStar transceiver, the SoftRock SDR kit, and starter or professional receiver solutions, e.g. the FiFi SDR for shortwave, or the Quadrus coherent multi-channel SDR receiver for short wave or VHF/UHF in direct digital mode of operation.

=== RTL-SDR ===
Eric Fry discovered that some common low-cost DVB-T USB dongles with the Realtek RTL2832U controller and tuner, e.g. the Elonics E4000 or the Rafael Micro R820T, can be used as a wide-band (3 MHz) SDR receiver. Experiments proved the capability of this setup to analyze Perseids meteor shower using Graves radar signals. This project is being maintained at Osmocom.

=== HPSDR ===
The HPSDR (High Performance Software Defined Radio) project uses a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter that provides performance over the range 0 to comparable to that of a conventional analogue HF radio. The receiver will also operate in the VHF and UHF range using either mixer image or alias responses. Interface to a PC is provided by a USB 2.0 interface, although Ethernet could be used as well. The project is modular and comprises a backplane onto which other boards plug in. This allows experimentation with new techniques and devices without the need to replace the entire set of boards. An exciter provides of RF over the same range or into the VHF and UHF range using image or alias outputs.

=== WebSDR ===
WebSDR is a project initiated by Pieter-Tjerk de Boer providing access via browser to multiple SDR receivers worldwide covering the complete shortwave spectrum. De Boer has analyzed Chirp Transmitter signals using the coupled system of receivers.

=== KiwiSDR ===
KiwiSDR is also a via-browser SDR like WebSDR. Unlike WebSDR, the frequency is limited to 3 Hz to 30 MHz (ELF to HF)

== Other applications ==
On account of its increasing accessibility, with lower cost hardware, more software tools and documentation, the applications of SDR have expanded past their primary and historic use cases. SDR is now being used in areas such as wildlife tracking, radio astronomy, medical imaging research, and art.

<text>In communications and electronic engineering, an intermediate frequency (IF) is a frequency to which a carrier wave is shifted as an intermediate step in transmission or reception. The intermediate frequency is created by mixing the carrier signal with a local oscillator signal in a process called heterodyning, resulting in a signal at the difference or beat frequency. Intermediate frequencies are used in superheterodyne radio receivers, in which an incoming signal is shifted to an IF for amplification before final detection is done.

Conversion to an intermediate frequency is useful for several reasons. When several stages of filters are used, they can all be set to a fixed frequency, which makes them easier to build and to tune. Lower frequency transistors generally have higher gains so fewer stages are required. It&#x27;s easier to make sharply selective filters at lower fixed frequencies.

There may be several such stages of intermediate frequency in a superheterodyne receiver; two or three stages are called &quot;double&quot; (alternatively, &quot;dual&quot;) or &quot;triple conversion&quot;, respectively.

==Justification==
Intermediate frequencies are used for three general reasons. At very high (gigahertz) frequencies, signal processing circuitry performs poorly. Active devices such as transistors cannot deliver much amplification (gain). Ordinary circuits using capacitors and inductors must be replaced with cumbersome high frequency techniques such as striplines and waveguides. So a high frequency signal is converted to a lower IF for more convenient processing. For example, in satellite dishes, the microwave downlink signal received by the dish is converted to a much lower IF at the dish so that a relatively inexpensive coaxial cable can carry the signal to the receiver inside the building. Bringing the signal in at the original microwave frequency would require an expensive waveguide.

In receivers that can be tuned to different frequencies, a second reason is to convert the various different frequencies of the stations to a common frequency for processing. It is difficult to build multistage amplifiers, filters, and detectors that can have all stages track the tuning of different frequencies, but it is comparatively easy to build tunable oscillators. Superheterodyne receivers tune in different frequencies by adjusting the frequency of the local oscillator on the input stage, and all processing after that is done at the same fixed frequency: the IF. Without using an IF, all the complicated filters and detectors in a radio or television would have to be tuned in unison each time the frequency was changed as was necessary in the early tuned radio frequency receivers (TRF). A more important advantage is that it gives the receiver a constant bandwidth over its tuning range. The bandwidth of a filter is proportional to its center frequency. In receivers like the TRF in which the filtering is done at the incoming RF frequency, as the receiver is tuned to higher frequencies, its bandwidth increases.

The main reason for using an intermediate frequency is to improve frequency selectivity. In communication circuits, a very common task is to separate out, or extract, signals or components of a signal that are close together in frequency. This is called filtering. Some examples are: picking up a radio station among several that are close in frequency, or extracting the chrominance subcarrier from a TV signal. With all known filtering techniques the filter&#x27;s bandwidth increases proportionately with the frequency. So a narrower bandwidth and more selectivity can be achieved by converting the signal to a lower IF and performing the filtering at that frequency. FM and television broadcasting with their narrow channel widths, as well as more modern telecommunications services such as cell phones and cable television, would be impossible without using frequency conversion.

==Uses==
Perhaps the most commonly used intermediate frequencies for broadcast receivers are around 455 kHz for AM receivers and 10.7 MHz for FM receivers. In special purpose receivers other frequencies can be used. A dual-conversion receiver may have two intermediate frequencies, a higher one to improve image rejection and a second, lower one, for desired selectivity. A first intermediate frequency may even be higher than the input signal, so that all undesired responses can be easily filtered out by a fixed-tuned RF stage.

In a digital receiver, the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) operates at low sampling rates, so input RF must be mixed down to IF to be processed. Intermediate frequency tends to be lower frequency range compared to the transmitted RF frequency. However, the choices for the IF are most dependent on the available components such as mixer, filters, amplifiers and others that can operate at lower frequency. There are other factors involved in deciding the IF, because lower IF is susceptible to noise and higher IF can cause clock jitters.

Modern satellite television receivers use several intermediate frequencies. The 500 television channels of a typical system are transmitted from the satellite to subscribers in the Ku microwave band, in two subbands of 10.7–11.7 and 11.7–12.75 GHz. The downlink signal is received by a satellite dish. In the box at the focus of the dish, called a low-noise block downconverter (LNB), each block of frequencies is converted to the IF range of 950–2150 MHz by two fixed frequency local oscillators at 9.75 and 10.6 GHz. One of the two blocks is selected by a control signal from the set top box inside, which switches on one of the local oscillators. This IF is carried into the building to the television receiver on a coaxial cable. At the cable company&#x27;s set top box, the signal is converted to a lower IF of 480 MHz for filtering, by a variable frequency oscillator. This is sent through a 30 MHz bandpass filter, which selects the signal from one of the transponders on the satellite, which carries several channels. Further processing selects the channel desired, demodulates it and sends the signal to the television.

==History==
An intermediate frequency was first used in the superheterodyne radio receiver, invented by American scientist Major Edwin Armstrong in 1918, during World War I. A member of the Signal Corps, Armstrong was building radio direction finding equipment to track German military signals at the then-very high frequencies of 500 to 3500 kHz. The triode vacuum tube amplifiers of the day would not amplify stably above 500 kHz; however, it was easy to get them to oscillate above that frequency. Armstrong&#x27;s solution was to set up an oscillator tube that would create a frequency near the incoming signal and mix it with the incoming signal in a mixer tube, creating a heterodyne or signal at the lower difference frequency where it could be amplified easily. For example, to pick up a signal at 1500 kHz the local oscillator would be tuned to 1450 kHz. Mixing the two created an intermediate frequency of 50 kHz, which was well within the capability of the tubes. The name &quot;superheterodyne&quot; was a contraction of &quot;supersonic heterodyne&quot;, to distinguish it from receivers in which the heterodyne frequency was low enough to be directly audible, and which were used for receiving continuous wave (CW) Morse code transmissions (not speech or music).

After the war, in 1920, Armstrong sold the patent for the superheterodyne to Westinghouse, who subsequently sold it to RCA. The increased complexity of the superheterodyne circuit compared to earlier regenerative or tuned radio frequency receiver designs slowed its use, but the advantages of the intermediate frequency for selectivity and static rejection eventually won out; by 1930, most radios sold were &#x27;superhets&#x27;. During the development of radar in World War II, the superheterodyne principle was essential for downconversion of the very high radar frequencies to intermediate frequencies. Since then, the superheterodyne circuit, with its intermediate frequency, has been used in virtually all radio receivers.

==Examples==

* down to c. 20 kHz, 30 kHz (A. L. M. Sowerby and H. B. Dent), 45 kHz (first commercial superheterodyne receiver: RCA Radiola AR-812 of 1923/1924), c. 50 kHz, c. 100 kHz, c. 120 kHz
* 110 kHz was used in European AM longwave broadcast receivers.
* 175 kHz (early wide band and communications receivers before introduction of powdered iron cores)
* 260 kHz (early standard broadcast receivers), 250–270 kHz
* Copenhagen Frequency Allocations: 415–490 kHz, 510–525 kHz
* AM radio receivers: 450 kHz, 455 kHz (most common), 460 kHz, 465 kHz, 467 kHz, 470 kHz, 475 kHz, and 480 kHz.
* FM radio receivers: 262 kHz (old car radios), 455 kHz, 1.6 MHz, 5.5 MHz, 10.7 MHz (most common), 10.8 MHz, 11.2 MHz, 11.7 MHz, 11.8 MHz, 13.45 MHz, 21.4 MHz, 75 MHz and 98 MHz. In double-conversion superheterodyne receivers, a first intermediate frequency of 10.7 MHz is often used, followed by a second intermediate frequency of 470 kHz (or 700 kHz with DYNAS). There are triple conversion designs used in police scanner receivers, high-end communications receivers, and many point-to-point microwave systems. Modern DSP chip consumer radios often use a &#x27;low-IF&#x27; of 128 kHz for FM.
* Narrowband FM receivers: 455 kHz (most common), 470 kHz
* Shortwave receivers: 1.6 MHz, 1.6–3.0 MHz, 4.3 MHz (for 40–50 MHz-only receivers). In double-conversion superheterodyne receivers, a first intermediate frequency of 3.0 MHz is sometimes combined with a second IF of 465 kHz.
* Analogue television receivers using system M: 41.25 MHz (audio) and 45.75 MHz (video). Note, the channel is flipped over in the conversion process in an intercarrier system, so the audio IF is lower than the video IF. Also, there is no audio local oscillator; the injected video carrier serves that purpose.
* Analogue television receivers using system B and similar systems: 33.4 MHz for the aural and 38.9 MHz for the visual signal. (The discussion about the frequency conversion is the same as in system M.)
* Satellite uplink-downlink equipment: 70 MHz, 950–1450 MHz (L-band) downlink first IF.
* Terrestrial microwave equipment: 250 MHz, 70 MHz or 75 MHz.
* Radar: 30 MHz.
* RF test equipment: 310.7 MHz, 160 MHz, and 21.4 MHz.

<text>In Greek mythology, Abderus or Abderos (Ancient Greek: Ἄβδηρος) was a divine hero, reputed by some to be one of Heracles&#x27; lovers (eromenoi), and reputedly a son of Hermes by some accounts, and eponym of Abdera, Thrace.

== Family ==
Some sources say he was the son of the god Hermes and a native of Opus in Locris, and according to other writers, he was the son of Thromius the Locrian. Pindar makes Abderus a son of Poseidon and Thronia, while Photius writes that he was brother of Patroclus, and according to Hellanicus (who considers him the son of Hermes), he was Heracles&#x27; lover.

== Mythology ==
Abderus was mostly known for his tragic role in Heracles&#x27; Eighth Labor. Along with others, he helped Heracles capture the four savage mares of Diomedes the king of the Thracian Bistones. Heracles overpowered the grooms and drove the Mares of Diomedes into the sea and left them in the care of Abderus. However, while Heracles was away, the horses devoured Abderus. In revenge, Heracles fed Diomedes alive to his own mares. Heracles founded the city of Abdera near Abderus&#x27;s tomb, where &quot;agones&quot; (Greek: ), athletic games consisting of boxing, pancratium and wrestling were held in his honor (but chariot races were banned in respect of how he died).

In some very different traditions, instead of helping Heracles with his Eighth Labor, Abderus (or Abdertis) was a servant of Diomedes, and was killed by Heracles together with his master and his four men-devouring horses.

His urbane comedies of manners gave him the reputation of being Hollywood&#x27;s most elegant and sophisticated director; as his prestige grew, his films were promoted as having &quot;the Lubitsch touch&quot;. Among his best known works are &quot;Trouble in Paradise&quot; (1932), &quot;Design for Living&quot; (1933), &quot;Ninotchka&quot; (1939), &quot;The Shop Around the Corner&quot; (1940), &quot;To Be or Not to Be&quot; (1942) and &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; (1943).

He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director three times for &quot;The Patriot&quot; (1928), &quot;The Love Parade&quot; (1929), and &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; (1943); his pictures &quot;The Smiling Lieutenant&quot; and &quot;One Hour with You&quot; were also nominated for Outstanding Production in 1932. In 1946, he received an Honorary Academy Award for his distinguished contributions to the art of the motion picture.

==Early life==
Lubitsch was born in 1892 in Berlin, the son of Simon Lubitsch, a tailor, and Anna (née) Lindenstaedt. His family was Ashkenazi Jewish; his father was born in Grodno in the Russian Empire (now Belarus), and his mother was from Wriezen outside Berlin. He turned his back on his father&#x27;s tailoring business to enter the theater, and by 1911 was a member of Max Reinhardt&#x27;s Deutsches Theater.

==Career==

===Early work, 1913–1921===

In 1913, Lubitsch made his film debut as an actor in &quot;The Ideal Wife&quot;. He gradually abandoned acting to concentrate on directing. He appeared in approximately 30 films as an actor between 1912 and 1920. His last film appearance as an actor was in the 1920 drama &quot;Sumurun&quot;, opposite Pola Negri and Paul Wegener, which he also directed.

In 1918, he made his mark as a serious director with &quot;Die Augen der Mumie Ma&quot; (&quot;The Eyes of the Mummy&quot;), starring Pola Negri. Lubitsch alternated between escapist comedies and large-scale historical dramas, enjoying great international success with both. His reputation as a grand master of world cinema reached a new peak after the release of his spectacles &quot;Madame Du Barry&quot; (retitled &quot;Passion&quot;, 1919) and &quot;Anna Boleyn&quot; (&quot;Deception&quot;, 1920). Both of these films found American distributorship by early 1921. They, along with Lubitsch&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; (released as &quot;Gypsy Blood&quot; in the U.S. in 1921) were selected by &quot;The New York Times&quot; on its list of the 15 most important movies of 1921.

With glowing reviews and American money flowing his way, Lubitsch formed his own production company and set to work on the high-budget spectacular &quot;The Loves of Pharaoh&quot; (1921). Lubitsch sailed to the United States for the first time in December 1921 for what was intended as a lengthy publicity and professional factfinding tour, scheduled to culminate in the February premiere of &quot;Pharaoh&quot;. However, with World War I still fresh, and with a slew of German &quot;New Wave&quot; releases encroaching on American movie workers&#x27; livelihoods, Lubitsch was not gladly received. He cut his trip short after little more than three weeks and returned to Germany. But he had already seen enough of the American film industry to know that its resources far outstripped the spartan German companies.

===Hollywood silent films, 1922–1927===

Lubitsch finally left Germany for Hollywood in 1922, contracted as a director by Mary Pickford. He directed Pickford in the film &quot;Rosita&quot;; the result was a critical and commercial success, but director and star clashed during its filming, and it ended up as the only project that they made together. A free agent after just one American film, Lubitsch was signed to a remarkable three-year, six-picture contract by Warner Brothers that guaranteed the director his choice of both cast and crew, and full editing control over the final cut.

Settling in America, Lubitsch established his reputation for sophisticated comedy with such stylish films as &quot;The Marriage Circle&quot; (1924), &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot; (1925), and &quot;So This Is Paris&quot; (1926). But his films were only marginally profitable for Warner Brothers, and Lubitsch&#x27;s contract was eventually dissolved by mutual consent, with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Paramount buying out the remainder. His first film for MGM, &quot;The Student Prince in Old Heidelberg&quot; (1927), was well regarded, but lost money. &quot;The Patriot&quot; (1928), produced by Paramount, earned him his first Academy Award nomination for Best Directing.

===Sound films, 1928–1940===
Lubitsch seized upon the advent of sound films to direct musicals. With his first sound film, &quot;The Love Parade&quot; (1929), starring Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald, Lubitsch hit his stride as a maker of worldly musical comedies (and earned himself another Oscar nomination). &quot;The Love Parade&quot; (1929), &quot;Monte Carlo&quot; (1930), and &quot;The Smiling Lieutenant&quot; (1931) were hailed by critics as masterpieces of the newly emerging musical genre. Lubitsch served on the faculty of the University of Southern California for a time.

His next film was a romantic comedy, written with Samson Raphaelson, &quot;Trouble in Paradise&quot; (1932). Later described (approvingly) as &quot;truly amoral&quot; by critic David Thomson, the cynical comedy was popular both with critics and with audiences. But it was a project that could only have been made before the enforcement of the Production Code, and after 1935, &quot;Trouble in Paradise&quot; was withdrawn from circulation. It was not seen again until 1968. The film was never available on videocassette and only became available on DVD in 2003.
Writing about Lubitsch&#x27;s work, critic Michael Wilmington observed:
Whether with music, as in MGM&#x27;s opulent &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; (1934) and Paramount&#x27;s &quot;One Hour with You&quot; (1932), or without, as in &quot;Design for Living&quot; (1933), Lubitsch continued to specialize in comedy. He made only one other dramatic film, the antiwar &quot;Broken Lullaby&quot; (also known as &quot;The Man I Killed&quot;, 1932).

In 1935, he was appointed Paramount&#x27;s production manager, thus becoming the only major Hollywood director to run a large studio. Lubitsch subsequently produced his own films and supervised the production of films of other directors. But Lubitsch had trouble delegating authority, which was a problem when he was overseeing sixty different films. He was fired after a year on the job, and returned to full-time moviemaking. In 1936, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States.

On July 27, 1935, he married British actress Vivian Gaye. They had one daughter, Nicola Anne Patricia Lubitsch, on October 27, 1938. When war was declared in Europe, Vivian Lubitsch and her daughter were staying in London. Vivian sent her baby daughter, accompanied by her nursemaid, Consuela Strohmeier, to Montreal aboard the Donaldson Atlantic Line&#x27;s , which was sunk by a German submarine on September 3, 1939 with a loss of 118 passengers. The child and the nurse survived.

In 1939, Lubitsch moved to MGM, and directed Greta Garbo in &quot;Ninotchka&quot;. Garbo and Lubitsch were friendly and had hoped to work together on a movie for years, but this would be their only project. The film, co-written by Billy Wilder, is a satirical comedy in which the famously serious actress&#x27; laughing scene was promoted by studio publicists with the tagline &quot;Garbo Laughs!&quot;

In 1940, he directed &quot;The Shop Around the Corner&quot;, a comedy of cross purposes. The film reunited Lubitsch with his &quot;Merry Widow&quot; screenwriter Raphaelson, and starred James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan as a pair of bickering co-workers in Budapest, each unaware that the other is their secret romantic correspondent. David Thomson wrote:
===Later films, 1941–1947===
Lubitsch next directed &quot;That Uncertain Feeling&quot; (1941), a remake of his 1925 film &quot;Kiss Me Again;&quot; an independent production by Lubitsch with Sol Lesser, it was not a commercial success. Lubitsch followed with a film that has become one of his best regarded comedies, &quot;To Be or Not to Be&quot;, a witty, dark and insightful film about a troupe of actors in Nazi-occupied Poland. He spent the balance of his career at 20th Century Fox, but a heart condition curtailed his activity, and he spent much of his time in supervisory capacities. His next picture was &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; (1943), his first color film and another Raphaelson collaboration. The film is about Henry Van Cleve (played by Don Ameche), who presents himself at the gates of Hell to recount his life and the women he has known from his mother onward, concentrating on his happy but sometimes difficult 25 years of marriage to Martha (Gene Tierney).

After &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;, Lubitsch began work on &quot;A Royal Scandal&quot; (1945), a remake of his silent film &quot;Forbidden Paradise&quot;. Edwin Justus Mayer wrote the screenplay for &quot;A Royal Scandal&quot; and had worked with Lubitsch on &quot;To Be or Not to Be&quot; (1942). &quot;A Royal Scandal&#x27;s&quot; pre-production and rehearsals were completed under Lubitsch, the original director of this film. He became ill during shooting, so Lubitsch hired Otto Preminger to finish the film. After &quot;A Royal Scandal&quot;, Lubitsch regained his health, and directed &quot;Cluny Brown&quot; (1946), with Charles Boyer and Jennifer Jones.

In March 1947, Lubitsch was awarded a Special Academy Award for his &quot;25-year contribution to motion pictures&quot;. Presenter Mervyn LeRoy, calling Lubitsch &quot;a master of innuendo&quot;, described some of his attributes as a filmmaker: &quot;He had an adult mind and a hatred of saying things the obvious way.&quot; Lubitsch was the subject of several interviews at that time, and consistently cited &quot;The Shop Around the Corner&quot; as his favorite of his films. Considering his overall career, he mused &quot;I made sometimes pictures which were not up to my standard, but then it can only be said about a mediocrity that all his works live up to his standard.&quot;

===Death===
Lubitsch died of a heart attack on November 30, 1947, in Hollywood at the age of 55. His last film, &quot;That Lady in Ermine&quot; with Betty Grable, was completed by Otto Preminger and released posthumously in 1948.

When leaving Lubitsch&#x27;s funeral, William Wyler said &quot;No more Lubitsch.&quot; Billy Wilder responded &quot;Worse than that. No more Lubitsch pictures.&quot; Lubitsch is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park. On February 8, 1960, Lubitsch received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the motion pictures industry, at 7040 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood.

Biographer Scott Eyman attempted to characterize the famed &quot;Lubitsch touch&quot;:
==Career assessment and legacy==
In 1946, he received an Honorary Academy Award for his distinguished contributions to the art of the motion picture. He was nominated three times for Best Director.

The Ernst-Lubitsch-Prize, a German Comedy prize, was established in 1958 in an effort of Billy Wilder to keep the memory of his friend alive.

<doc id="83146" wikidata="Q2667947" url="?curid=83146" title="Acherusia">
<text>In Greek mythology, Acherusia ( or ) was a name given by the ancients to several lakes or swamps, which, like the various rivers called Acheron, were at some time believed to be connected with the underworld, until at last the Acherusia came to be considered to be in the lower world itself.
== Locations of the lakes ==
The lake to which this belief seems to have been first attached was the Acherusia in Thesprotia, through which the river Acheron flowed. Other lakes or swamps of the same name, and believed to be in connection with the lower world, were near Hermione in Argolis, near Heraclea in Bithynia, between Cumae and cape Misenum in Campania, and lastly in Egypt, near Memphis.
== Acherusia as a cavern ==
In Greek mythology, it was also the name of a cavern through which Heracles dragged Cerberus as one of his Twelve Labors.
== Location of cleansing ==
In Plato&#x27;s &quot;Phaedo&quot;, souls are divided into four different categories. Evil souls are sent to Tartarus; good souls are sent onward to pure places of the world; but neutral souls as well as repentant people who performed great crimes are not immediately sent to their next realm. Neutral souls are cleansed in the Acherusian Lake before proceeding onward, similar to good souls but slower. People who committed great evil yet were repentant can hope their victims invite them into Acherusia where they can undergo the cleansing process.
== Role in Christianity ==
Early Christianity adopted various terms and concepts from Greek mythology, especially among Greek pagans who converted to Pauline Christianity, including the Acherusian Lake, Elysian Fields, and Hades. The early Greek Christian view seem especially influenced by the fate of the 4th group described by Plato, with Acherusia a place for repentant sinners to be cleansed, possibly at the invitation of those whom they wronged. The 2nd century Apocalypse of Peter describes how prayers for the dead by saints in heaven would move God to give a post-mortem baptism or washing of damned souls in hell in the Acherusian Lake, allowing them into paradise after a period of cleansing suffering. The account in the Apocalypse of Peter is quoted in the Sibylline Oracles and several other works. In the 4th century Apocalypse of Paul, the archangel Michael washes souls in the Acherusian Lake before their entry into the City of Christ in Paradise. The 3rd to 5th century Apocalypse of Moses features a story where Adam is washed in the Acherusian Lake before being brought to converse with God, presumably to ensure his ritual purity. The Book of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, by Bartholomew the Apostle, an 8th-9th century work, features a tour of the afterlife; after the narrator passes through the river of fire (which does not actually harm the godly, for whom it seems like a normal river of water), the angel Michael washes him three times in the Acherusian Lake before proceeding deeper into heaven.

<text>In Greek mythology, Danaë (, ; ; , ) was an Argive princess and mother of the hero Perseus by Zeus. She was credited with founding the city of Ardea in Latium during the Bronze Age.

== Family ==
Danae was the daughter and only child of King Acrisius of Argos by his wife Queen Eurydice or Aganippe. In some accounts, she had a sister, Evarete, wife of King Oenomaus of Pisa and mother of Hippodamia.

== Mythology ==
Disappointed by his lack of male heirs, King Acrisius asked the oracle of Delphi if this would change. The oracle announced to him that he would never have a son, but his daughter would, and that he would be killed by his daughter&#x27;s son. At the time, Danaë was childless and, meaning to keep her so, King Acrisius shut her up in a bronze chamber to be constructed under the court of his palace (other versions say she was imprisoned in a tall brass tower with a single richly adorned chamber, but with no doors or windows, just a small air vent as the source of light and air). She was buried in this tomb, with the intent that she be closed off from all others for the rest of her life. However, Zeus, the king of the gods, desired her, and came to her in the form of golden rain which streamed in through the roof of the subterranean chamber and down into her womb. Soon after, their child Perseus was born.

Unwilling to provoke the wrath of the gods or the Furies by killing his offspring and grandchild, King Acrisius cast Danaë and Perseus into the sea in a wooden chest. The sea was calmed by Poseidon and, at the request of Zeus, the pair survived. They were washed ashore on the island of Seriphos, where they were taken in by the fisherman Dictys—the brother of King Polydectes—who raised Perseus to manhood in the temple of Athena. The King was charmed by Danaë, but she had no interest in him. Consequently, he agreed not to marry her only if her son would bring him the head of the Gorgon Medusa. Using Athena&#x27;s shield, Hermes&#x27;s winged sandals and Hades&#x27;s helmet of invisibility, Perseus was able to evade Medusa&#x27;s gaze and decapitate her.

Later, after Perseus brought back Medusa&#x27;s head and rescued Andromeda the princess of Aethiopia, the oracle&#x27;s prophecy came true. He started for Argos, but learning of the prophecy, instead went to Larissa, where athletic games, Olympics, were being held. By chance, an aging Acrisius was there and Perseus accidentally struck him on the head with his javelin (or discus), fulfilling the prophecy.

<text>Dictys (, &quot;Díktus&quot;) was a name attributed to four men in Greek mythology.

* Dictys, a fisherman and brother of King Polydectes of Seriphos, both being the sons of Magnes and a Naiad, or of Peristhenes and Androthoe, or else of Poseidon and Cerebia. He discovered Danaë and Perseus inside a chest that had been washed up on shore (or was caught in his fishing net). He treated them well and raised Perseus as his own son. After Perseus killed Medusa, rescued Andromeda, and later showed Medusa&#x27;s head to Polydectes turning him and the nobles with him to stone, he made Dictys king. Dictys and his wife, Clymene, had an altar within a sacred precinct of Perseus in Athens.
* Dictys, one of the sailors who tried to abduct Dionysus but was turned into a dolphin by the god.
* Dictys, a centaur who attended Pirithous&#x27; wedding and battled against the Lapiths. While fleeing Pirithous, he slipped and fell off of a cliff. He was impaled on the top of an ash tree and died.
* Dictys, the Elean son of Poseidon and Agamede, daughter of Augeas. He was the brother of Actor and Belus.
* &quot;Dictys&quot; is also the title of a lost play by Euripides, which survives in fragmentary form.

<text>In Greek mythology, King Polydectes () was the ruler of the island of Seriphos.

== Family ==
Polydectes was the son of either Magnes and an unnamed naiad, or of Peristhenes and Androthoe, or of Poseidon and Cerebia. His story is largely a part of the myth of Perseus, and runs as follows according to the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; and John Tzetzes. He was the brother of the fisherman Dictys, who succeeded him on the throne.

== Mythology ==

Polydectes fell in love with Danaë when she and her son Perseus were saved by his brother Dictys (see: Acrisius). Perseus, old enough by the time, was very protective of his mother and would not allow Polydectes near her. Therefore, Polydectes hatched a plot to get him out of the way. Under the pretense that he was going to marry Hippodamia, he ordered every man in Seriphos to supply him with suitable gifts. His friends were to provide horses but Perseus failed to bring any, so Polydectes announced that he wanted nothing more than the head of the Gorgon Medusa, since Perseus had previously said he was up to a task so harsh as fetching a Gorgon&#x27;s head. Perseus agreed and Polydectes told him that he could not return to the island without it. Perseus slew Medusa, using a shield supplied by Athena as a mirror to avoid looking at the gorgon.

When Perseus returned to Seriphos with the Gorgon&#x27;s head, he found that, in his absence, his mother was threatened and abused by Polydectes, and had to seek refuge in a temple. Perseus was outraged and strode into the throne room where Polydectes and other nobles were convening. Polydectes was surprised that the hero was still alive and refused to believe Perseus had accomplished the deed he was sent out to do. Perseus protested that he had indeed slain the Gorgon Medusa, and, as proof, revealed her severed head. No sooner had Polydectes and his nobles gazed upon the prize when they were turned to stone. In a version recorded by Hyginus, Polydectes, fearing the courage of Perseus, made a treacherous attempt on his life, and Perseus succeeded in exposing the Gorgon&#x27;s head just in time. Perseus then handed the kingdom of Seriphos over to Dictys.

In an alternate version followed by Hyginus, Polydectes married Danaë as she was brought to him by Dictys, and had Perseus brought up in a temple of Athena. He did not abuse Perseus and Danae, but rather protected them from Acrisius as the latter discovered that they had survived and arrived at Seriphos to kill them. Perseus eventually swore to never kill his grandfather, but Polydectes soon died and at his funeral games Perseus accidentally hit Acrisius with a discus, which resulted in Acrisius&#x27; death.

<text>In Greek mythology, the Perseides, &quot;those born of Perseus&quot; and Andromeda, are the members of the House of Perseus, descended, according to Valerius Flaccus through Perse and Perses.

After the Greek Dark Ages, tradition recalled that Perseus and his descendants the Perseides had ruled Tiryns in Mycenaean times, while the allied branch descended from Perseus&#x27; great-uncle Proetus ruled in Argos.

Perseus and Andromeda had seven sons: Perses, Alcaeus, Heleus, Mestor, Sthenelus, Electryon, and Cynurus, and two daughters, Gorgophone, and Autochthe. Perses was left in Aethiopia and was believed to have become an ancestor of the Persians. The other descendants ruled Mycenae from Electryon down to Eurystheus, after whom Atreus got the kingdom. The most renowned of the Perseides was Greece&#x27;s greatest hero, Heracles son of Zeus and Alcmene, daughter of Electryon.

<text>The Centrale Lyon (), formerly  (, abbr. ECL), is a research university in greater Lyon, France. Founded in 1857 by François Barthélemy Arlès-Dufour in response to the increasing industrialization of France, it is one of the oldest graduate schools in France. The university is part of the &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot;, a prestigious group of French institutions dedicated to engineering, scientific research, and business education. The current 45-acre (18 ha) campus opened in 1967 and is located in the city of Ecully.

The is traditionally known for its research and education in applied science and engineering. It excels in the research fields of acoustics, biosciences and nanotechnology, and is continuously ranked in the top five &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot; for the quality of its engineering graduate programs. The school is well-reputed for educating and training highly skilled engineers through many specialized graduate programs with a strong emphasis on laboratory instruction. Students graduate with a degree known as the &quot;diplôme d&#x27;ingénieur&quot;, which is an academic title protected by the French government and equivalent to a Master of Science, or with a PhD upon completion of their doctoral studies.

The has strong ties with top institutions in Europe including Imperial College London and Darmstadt University of Technology. The university is one of the founding members of the Ecoles Centrales Group network (with campuses in Paris, Nantes, Lille, Marseille, and Beijing). It is also a founding member of University of Lyon&#x27;s center for Research and Higher Education, which has over 120,000 students. Thus, it shares many of its PhD programs with other institutions part of University of Lyon such as INSA Lyon, , and Claude Bernard University Lyon 1.

==History and location==

It was founded in 1857 on a private initiative by Désiré Girardon, who was its first president. The founding vision was to educate multidisciplinary engineers for the emerging industry (&quot;doctors for fabs and plants&quot;). The institution was given to the French State Ministry of Education in 1947. Initially located downtown Lyon, it was transferred to Écully, its current location.

===Growth===
*1857: Birth of the Lyons Central School for Industry and Commerce, on the initiative of Desire Girardon, a professor at La Martiniere School, an institution for the teaching of advanced industrial science and based primarily on the methods of La Martiniere school. The school was located at the corner of the Rue d&#x27;Enghien (later Rue Vauban) and the course of Bourbon (later Castellane dock and pier-General Sarrail).
*3 November 1857: Opening of the school with 14 students, who are promoting an issue, that of 1860.
*1860: The first class graduated, it will be followed by a promotion of 17 students.

==Academics==

The &quot;centralien&quot; program is the main academic program offered by the , as a Centrale Graduate School. It is quite different from typical university or college studies; and specific to the French system of grandes écoles. The engineering degree of (&quot;ingénieur centralien&quot; or &quot;centralien engineer&quot;) is a Master of Science degree.

The defining characteristic of the curriculum is that it is multidisciplinary, with studies focusing on all math and physics derived engineering specialties: mechanics, physics, materials, fluid mechanics, electrical engineering, applied mathematics, civil engineering, aeronautics, computer science, telecommunications and micro-nano-biotechnology.

===Admission===

The large majority of the students are admitted after two to three years of classes préparatoires, known as &quot;mathematics superior&quot; and &quot;mathematics special&quot;, which are an undergraduate courses with almost exclusive emphasis on math and physics. These undergraduate students must then take a nationwide competitive entrance examination (Concours Centrale-Supélec) to enter a Centrale Graduate School, including Ecole centrale de Lyon. Ecole centrale de Lyon recruits among the top 6% of the students in &quot;classes preparatoires&quot;, who represent themselves 7% of higher education students, which makes it a selective and prestigious institution.
A few seats are available each year to select students from French universities after completion of three or four years of post high-school education.
A significant contingent of students also comes from leading international universities which belong to the TIME network.

===Curriculum===

Education at the ECL is multidisciplinary and typically lasts three to four years. During the first two years (&quot;tronc commun&quot;, or &quot;core curriculum&quot;), students take mandatory classes in science (mathematics, physics); in engineering (solid mechanics, heat transfer, digital image processing, computer programming) and in social sciences (economics, management, foreign languages). Students are then offered to sign up for different engineering specialties during their last year at the school. After completing these three years of education, they receive the degree of &quot;ingénieur de l&#x27;École centrale de Lyon&quot;, more commonly called &quot;ingénieur centralien&quot;.

==National and international ties==

The &quot;École centrale de Lyon&quot; belongs to the French Centrale Graduate School, together with École centrale Paris, École centrale de Lille, École centrale de Nantes, École centrale de Marseille and École centrale de Pékin (Beijing, China).

Since 1857, the school has built important international ties. Students come from around the world to study for several years on the school campus. &quot;école centrale&quot; students may also obtain a double diploma at one of several partner schools. Furthermore, the école is one of the founding members of the TIME network. (member list)

A transversal research operation is specifically dedicated to the development of nanocharacterization tools and techniques.

The laboratory is situated on the campuses of École centrale de Lyon, INSA Lyon, University of Lyon 1 and CPE. It comprises 120 permanent staff and approximately 95 non-permanent staff. The annual budget excluding salaries is about 3M€.

===LMFA===
The LMFA is a joint research unit attached to the CNRS, École Centrale de Lyon, Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1 and INSA Lyon. It is a member of the Institut Carnot Engineering at Lyon. The activity of the laboratory is organized around four research groups: Centre for Acoustics, Fluid complex and Transfers Turbomachinery, Turbulence and Stability. The research focuses on the physics and modeling of turbulence, hydrodynamic instabilities, two-phase flows, environmental fluid mechanics, aerodynamics internal thermal phenomena coupled aeroacoustics, acoustic propagation, methods of solving Navier–Stokes equations, the active or passive control of flow, microfluidics. This research lead to numerous collaborations with industry players and institutional areas of transport, environment and energy. The goal is to provide developers with the tools of analysis and modeling to optimize their products or processes and reduce the energy and environmental impact. In the transport sector, the LMFA developed an expertise on turbine (axial compressors of aircraft engines, turbo and centrifugal machines) on the reduction of noise (cars, planes, TGV) and the new engine cars. Research in the environment focuses on mass transfer in the atmosphere, environmental hydraulics, noise and noise pollution, industrial hazards. The study covers the energy sector, particularly in terms of process optimization fluids, nuclear or oil phase flow, hydraulic turbines, new energy sources.

===LTDS===
The Laboratory of Tribology and Systems Dynamics, was created in 1992 and in January 1995 became a Mixed Unit of Research CNRS-MESR (ECL-ENISE) (UMR 5513) which depends on the Scientific Department Engineering and Information Sciences and Technologies, depending on Section 9 of the Evaluation National Committee. LTDS is on two sites: centrale Lyon (main site) and the National School of Engineers at Saint-Etienne.

Its scientific field is broad and covers tribology (study of friction, wear, lubrication, adherence), systems dynamics (control of vibrations and stability of systems and machine parts) Solids Mechanics (structures calculation) and transformation processes (cut, assembly, etc.).

The LTDS&#x27;s existence is due to the succession of the following events:
*1970: Creation of Surfaces Technology Department at Centrale Lyon by J.M. Georges
*1974: Association to CNRS: Surfaces Technology Laboratory, URA 855.
*1991: Proposal of widening to Solids Mechanics Department from Centrale Lyon and to Interfaces Physics Department from ENISE.
*1993: Creation of Laboratory of Tribology and Systems Dynamics, Director J.M. GEORGES. Change of direction: P. Kapsa Director.

===LIRIS===
LIRIS (Laboratoire d’InfoRmatique en Image et Systèmes d’information) was created in 2003 through the merging of several former laboratories involved in Communication and Information Technology research. LIRIS is affiliated to CNRS (Centre National de Recherche Scientifique) under the label UMR 5205.

The laboratory involves 280 people with 94 faculty members and researchers from INSA de Lyon, Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Ecole Centrale de Lyon, Université Lumière Lyon 2 and CNRS.

The laboratory is organized in two departments:

*Image department: It has approximately 40 faculty members (12 professors, 28 associate professors) and 3 permanent researchers. The department incorporates five research teams. The research activities of the department cover a wide variety of methods for sensors (2D, 2D+t, 3D) data analysis, for a better understanding and for multidimensional data modeling. Hence, the research activities cover the areas of image analysis, modeling, simulation and rendering. Various data representation models are investigated, including regular grids of sensors, graphs, mesh, geometric models, procedural models, statistical or physical models. The hybridization of these models can yield to the enrichment of the representation space. The developed techniques rest on competencies of the research teams around image and signal processing, geometric modeling, algorithmic geometry, discrete geometry, topology, graphs, realistic rendering and augmented reality.
*Data, Knowledge and Services (DCS) department: The DCS department is organized around five research teams involving 44 faculty members (11 professors, 33 associate professors). The research activities of the department cover a wide variety of theories, methods, and applications of information technology to the management of data, knowledge and services. It covers the following areas: knowledge discovery (data mining, complex systems modeling, knowledge engineering), data and services engineering (security and confidentiality, modeling, integration and querying, service composition).

The laboratory leads research on fundamental issues in these areas (image, and data, knowledge and services). It also investigates applications with an impact on society:

Culture and heritage (digital libraries, critical edition, digitization of ancient documents, archiving, 3D virtual museums, etc.)
Ambient intelligence (pervasive systems, sensor networks, intelligent video surveillance, secured communicating objects, etc.)
Biology and health (data mining, complex systems modeling and analysis, e-health, etc.)
Human learning (personalization, cognitive assistance, collaborative learning, etc.)
Digital entertainment (video games, animated cinema, multimedia data processing, etc.)

<text> (), or Centrale Nantes, is a grande école – a French engineering school – established in 1919 under the name of &quot;Institut Polytechnique de l&#x27;Ouest&quot;. It provides Bachelor, Graduate, Master, and PhD Programmes based on the latest scientific and technological developments and the best management practices.

Centrale Nantes is a member of the Ecoles Centrale Group, alongside its partner institutions CentraleSupélec, Centrale Lille, Centrale Lyon, Centrale Méditerranée, and Centrale Beijing. It is also a member of the TIME (Top Industrial Managers for Europe) network, that enables student exchanges among the leading engineering institutions in Europe.

==Location==
The Centrale Nantes campus is situated in the heart of Nantes, France in the Pays de la Loire region. Nantes is two hours by train from Paris. Nantes is the sixth largest city in France, located along the banks of the Loire 50 km away from the Atlantic coast.

==History==
Centrale Nantes was founded in 1919 under the name &quot;Institut Polytechnique de l&#x27;Ouest&quot;. It was renamed &quot;Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Mécanique&quot; (ENSM) in 1948 when it became an &quot;Ecole Nationale Supérieure d&#x27;Ingénieurs&quot;. Thirty years later, the school moved to its current site on the banks of the River Erdre. In 1991, it became, by decree published in the Official Journal, the &quot;Ecole Centrale de Nantes&quot;, joining the newly created Ecoles Centrale Group. As a member of this group, it offers a &quot;Centralien&quot; multi-disciplinary engineering programme leading to the award of the French &#x27;diplôme d&#x27;ingénieur&#x27;, as well as programmes at undergraduate, Master&#x27;s (including Erasmus Mundus Joint master&#x27;s degrees), Advanced Master&#x27;s, and PhD level. Executive Education programmes were introduced from 2017.

In 1993 the school became an &#x27;EPCSCP&#x27;, a public institution with a scientific, cultural and professional vocation. Centrale Nantes joined forces with Centrale Lille in 2006 within the Fondation Centrale Initiatives, and with Centrale Lyon in 2009 creating a joint subsidiary for the development of research: Centrale Innovation. In 2011, the school became a member of France AEROTECH. Centrale Nantes formed a structuring alliance with Audencia Business School in 2013 and ensa Nantes (Nantes School of Architecture) in 2014. In January 2022, Centrale Nantes became a component institution of the newly created Nantes University alongside the University of Nantes, Nantes University Hospital, Inserm, ensa Nantes, Nantes Saint-Nazaire School of Fine Arts and IRT Jules Verne.

==Reputation and rankings==
Centrale Nantes is consistently mentioned among the top engineering schools in France in national and international rankings. 
According to the 2022 Times Higher Education World University Rankings by Subject, out of 1,118 establishments ranked worldwide for Engineering and Technology, Centrale Nantes is in the top 250 for 2022. This ranking places the school in third place amongst French engineering schools.

Centrale Nantes has also been ranked in the top 25 global performing universities for student mobility since 2016.

Nationally, Centrale Nantes was ranked 4th French engineering school by L&#x27;Etudiant in 2021.

==Study==

===Undergraduate programmes===
At undergraduate-level, three programmes are offered: a four-year BBA (Bachelor of Business Administration) Big Data and Management co-created with Audencia to offer a joint programme in engineering and management which is taught in English; a three-year Bachelor in Science in Engineering programme which opened in September 2023 and a one-year Foundation Master&#x27;s programme which prepares bachelor-qualified students to meet the challenges of Centrale Nantes Master&#x27;s programmes.

===Engineering programme (diplôme d&#x27;ingénieur)===
Centrale Nantes trains 420 students per year within its general engineering programme leading to the &#x27;diplôme d&#x27;ingénieur&#x27; equivalent to a Master of Science and Engineering. This qualification is awarded to students after a total of five years of higher education. The admissions process is highly selective. French students with excellent high school results spend two years in the intensive &#x27;classes préparatoires aux grandes écoles&#x27; preparing for the &#x27;concours&#x27; – competitive entrance examinations to French engineering schools. Successful candidates then undertake three years of study at Centrale Nantes – corresponding to the senior undergraduate year and two graduate years. International students can join the engineering programme via the fast-track programme, or a double degree or exchange with one of Centrale Nantes partner institutions, or can apply via the Groupe des Ecoles Centrale university entrance examination.

Students follow a multi-disciplinary core curriculum in their first year, followed by a choice of specialisation in each of their second and third years: Advanced Modelling and Analysis of Structures; Aeronautics; Civil Engineering; Computer Science for Information Systems; Computer Science for AI; Data Analysis and Applications in Signal and Image Processing; Digital Sciences for Life Sciences and Healthcare; Energy Control and Management; Energy Production and Management; Engineering Science for Housing and Urban Environment; Health, Innovation, Manufacturing; Industrial Engineering; Low-tech engineering; Mathematics and Applications; Mechanical Engineering for Materials and Manufacturing Processes; Ocean: Hydrodynamics and Marine Engineering; Product Engineering; Propulsion and Transport; Renewable energies and grid integration; Robotics; Smart positioning and sustainable mobility; Virtual Reality.

In their final year students also follow a professional option, honing in on a particular sector of activity or company function: Business Finance; Engineering and digital sciences for art, culture and heritage; Engineering for Ecological Transition; Entrepreneurship; Healthcare and Humanitarian Engineer; International Business Development; Personal Project; Proficiency in project management; Research and Development; Science and Music.

===Master&#x27;s programmes===
Centrale Nantes offers six master&#x27;s of science, technology and health – in marine technology, mechanical engineering, control and robotics, civil engineering, city and urban environment, and industrial engineering. A number of specialisms are proposed within each master&#x27;s programme. They are taught in English.
* Marine Technology (M-TECH):
**Hydrodynamics for Ocean Engineering (M-TECH HOE)
**Atlantic Master on Ship Operation &amp; Naval Engineering (M-TECH AMASONE)
***École Navale and Centrale Nantes have joined forces to offer the Atlantique MAster in Ship Operations and Naval Engineering, an international master&#x27;s degree given in English. This technical training in hydrodynamics and naval energy/propulsion is based on practical experience in ship piloting (part of the training is given on board French Navy ships) and places great emphasis on operational techniques. The AMASONE project has the originality to combine the complementarity of the two establishments and thus cover theory, experimentation and ship&#x27;s conduct. The training includes a large part of experimental sciences and learning about naval operations, which constitutes a unique offer at this level in France and in Europe.

<text>&#x27; (, ECP; also known as &#x27; or Centrale) was a French grande école in engineering and science. It was also known by its official name . In 2015, merged with Supélec to form CentraleSupélec, a constituent college of the University of Paris-Saclay.

Founded in 1829, it was among the most prestigious and selective grandes écoles. Rooted in rich entrepreneurial tradition since the industrial revolution era, it served as the cradle for top-level engineers and executives who continue to constitute a major part of the industry leadership in France. Since the 19th century, its model of education for training generalist engineers inspired the establishment of several engineering institutes around the world, such as the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland, Faculté polytechnique de Mons in Belgium, as well as other member schools of the Ecole Centrales Group alliance in France, Morocco, China, and India.

==History==

École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures was founded in 1829 as a private institute by Alphonse Lavallée, a lawyer and a prominent businessman from Nantes, who put forward most of his personal capital into founding the school, together with three top scientists who became its founding associates: Eugène Peclet, Jean-Baptiste Dumas, and Théodore Olivier. Notably, Lavallée was a shareholder of &quot;Le Globe&quot;, which became in 1831 the official organ of the Saint-Simonian movement.

The founding vision of École Centrale was to train multidisciplinary engineers who will become the first &quot;doctors of factories and mills&quot; of the then-emerging industrial sector in France, at a time when most of the other engineering schools trained students for public service. As the scientific discoveries in this era were beginning to have a major impact on industrial development in Europe, a new breed of engineers with a broad and rigorous knowledge of sciences and mathematics were needed in order for France to develop its industry and consequently compete amongst the world&#x27;s superpowers.

The school was initially located in various premises in Paris, including Hotel Salé (which now hosts the Picasso Museum) and buildings which now belong to Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers. Lavallée served as the first president of École Centrale.

In 1857, Lavallée transferred the ownership of the school to the French state in order to ensure its sustainability. Under Napoleon&#x27;s initiative for an imperial university, the school was then temporarily renamed as École Impériale des Arts et Manufactures.

In 1862, graduates of the school were awarded accredited graduate diplomas in engineering, with the official academic title of &#x27;ingénieur des arts et manufactures&#x27;, which was the first of its kind in France.

The school was transferred in 1969 to a new campus located in Châtenay-Malabry. The Châtenay-Malabry campus was designed by architect , and was inaugurated by President Georges Pompidou, who was accompanied on this occasion by Robert Galley. The school was renamed as École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures.

In 2015, the school formed a strategic alliance with Supélec to create CentraleSupélec, which is part of the University of Paris-Saclay. The new campus is located in Gif-sur-Yvette, approximately 20 km from the center of Paris.

== Partnerships ==
 was one of the Centrale Graduate Schools associated as the &quot;Groupe Centrale&quot; network with its sister institutes (Lille, Lyon, Marseille, Nantes, Beijing, Hyderabad (with Mahindra Group) and Casablanca).

Since 1837, the school had established several international partnerships (double degrees, exchanges, research collaboration) with the world&#x27;s leading universities, such as California Institute of Technology, University of Cambridge, ETH Zurich, Georgia Institute of Technology, Harvard University, Indian Institutes of Technology, KAIST, Princeton University, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Politecnico di Milano, National University of Singapore, Stanford University, University of Toronto, Tsinghua University, TU Delft and Technische Universität München. It was a founding member of the TIME (Top Industrial Managers for Europe) network among top engineering schools in Europe, and also a member of the UniverSud Paris and the CESAER association of European engineering schools.

== Campus ==
Initially located in the &quot;Hôtel de Juigné&quot; (now &quot;Hôtel Salé&quot; and home to the &quot;Musée Picasso&quot;), the main campus of the school was transferred to &quot;rue Montgolfier&quot; in 1884, where it stayed until 1969. Its current location neighbours the &quot;Parc de Sceaux&quot;.

Former location of the &quot;École Centrale, rue Montgolfier&quot; in Paris (3rd arrondissement): 
The school is now located at Châtenay-Malabry, Hauts-de-Seine, a southern suburb of Paris (in the Île-de-France region), next to the &quot;Parc de Sceaux&quot; and its Château de Sceaux. Within the main campus at Châtenay Malabry, ECP hosts eight laboratories:
# Molecular and Macroscopic Energy, Combustion
# System Analysis and Macroeconomics Modeling
# Industrial Engineering
# Chemical Engineering and Materials Processing Laboratory
# Applied Mathematics
# Soil and Structure Mechanics
# Technology and Strategy
# Solids Structure and Properties

Most of the 2000 students at stay in dedicated on-campus student residences, which is located near the research labs and easily accessible via public transport.

Following the merger of the school with Supelec, now forming CentraleSupelec, the progressive move of the campus has started from Chatenay-Malabry to Gif-sur-Yvette.

== Admission ==
Most French students who were admitted to had completed 2 to 3 years of post high school education in sciences through the &quot;classes préparatoires&quot; or &quot;prépas&quot;, which corresponds to freshman and years at US universities. The &quot;classes préparatoires&quot; is itself a selective and academically intensive program that admits less than top 10% of high school graduates in France each year. The entrance examination to the &quot;grandes écoles&quot; including is taken by students only at the end of their second year in &quot;prépas&quot; (&quot;Mathématiques spéciales&quot;).

For its flagship degree program leading to the French engineer&#x27;s degree (Diplôme d&#x27;ingénieur), in 2016 for instance, recruited among the top 4% candidates from &quot;prépas&quot; for a quota of about 400 students, in addition to some 50 international students from top foreign universities after an equivalently selective process.

International students are first selected internally by their respective home universities on the basis of academic performance (within top 10% GPA) and receive additional training in various subjects including mathematics, sciences, computing, and French language for at least 1–2 years on top of their undergraduate degree program requirements. International students then apply and compete for admission to each grande école via written and oral examinations, and the application must include 2 referrals by professors, a record of extracurricular achievements, internship or research/project experiences, and a motivation letter.

Lastly, a small number of places for the engineer degree program is reserved for French university graduates who have excelled in a relevant 3-year bachelor&#x27;s degree program.

== Curriculum ==
The general engineering program at Centrale was multidisciplinary and typically lasted between 3 and 4 years. The curriculum was similar to those offered at other general engineering schools &quot;(écoles d&#x27;ingénieurs généralistes)&quot;. All courses were taught in either French or English.

During the first year (&quot;Tronc Commun&quot;, or &quot;Common Core&quot;), students were required to study several subjects in science (mathematics, quantum physics, biology...), engineering (continuum mechanics, heat transfer, algorithms, programming...), as well as social sciences (economics, management, foreign languages...). In the second year, students were given the option to choose elective courses but with heavy emphasis in science nevertheless. The first two years were also used to train students in various research, startup and industry projects.
In the third year, students could choose to major (specialize) in a particular field depending on their academic and professional interests. Upon graduation, students received the degree of &quot;Diplôme d&#x27;Ingénieur&quot; (equivalent to Master of Science) along with the title of &quot;Ingénieur diplômé&quot;, which was more commonly called &quot;Ingénieur centralien&quot;.

== The Graduate School ==
The school offered a broad range of specialized master&#x27;s programmes in science and engineering (one-year or two-year programs).

It also offered various PhD programmes for holders of a master&#x27;s degree. More than 200 doctoral candidates currently work in one of the eight laboratories of the school.

<text>In Greek mythology, Autonoë (; ) was a Theban princess as the eldest daughter of Cadmus, founder of Thebes in Boeotia, and the goddess Harmonia. She was the wife of Aristaeus and mother of Actaeon and possibly Macris.

== Mythology ==

=== Euripides&#x27; account ===
In Euripides&#x27; play, &quot;The Bacchae&quot;, she and her sisters were driven into a bacchic frenzy by the god Dionysus (her nephew) when Pentheus, the king of Thebes, refused to allow his worship in the city. When Pentheus came to spy on their revels, Agave, the mother of Pentheus and Autonoë&#x27;s sister, spotted him in a tree. They tore him to pieces in their Bacchic fury. The murder of Pentheus was brought by Dionysus as retribution for Pentheus&#x27;s lack of piety for the gods.

Actaeon, the son of Autonoë, was eaten by his own hounds as punishment for glimpsing Artemis naked. At last, grief and sadness at the lamentable fate of the house of her father induced Autonoe to quit Thebes to go to Ereneia, a village of the Megarians, where she died.

=== Oppian&#x27;s account ===
According to Oppian, Autonoe along with her sisters Ino and Agave became the nurses of the infant Dionysus, son of Semele their sister.

: For Ino, scion of Agenor, reared the infant Bacchus and first gave her breast to the son of Zeus, and Autonoe likewise and Agave joined in nursing him, but not in the baleful halls of Athamas, but on the mountain which at that time men called by the name of the Thigh (Μηρός). For greatly fearing the mighty spouse of Zeus and dreading the tyrant Pentheus, son of Echion, they laid the holy child in a coffer of pine and covered it with fawn-skins and wreathed it with clusters of the vine, in a grotto where round the child they danced the mystic dance and beat drums and clashed cymbals in their hands, to veil the cries of the infant. It was around that hidden ark that they first showed forth their mysteries, and with them the Aonian women secretly took paint rites. And they arrayed a gathering of their faithful companions to journey from that mountain out of the Boeotian land. For now, now was it fated that a land, which before was wild, should cultivate the vine at the instance of Dionysus who delivers from sorrow. Then the holy choir took up secret coffer and wreathed it and set it on the back of an ass. And they came unto the shores of the Euripus, where they found a seafaring old man with his sons, and all together they besought the fishermen that they might cross the water in their boats. Then the old man had compassion on them and received on board the holy women. And lo! on the benches of his boat flowered the lush bindweed and blooming vine and ivy wreathed the stern. Now would the fishermen, cowering in god-sent terror, have dived into the sea, but ere that the boat came to land. And to Euboea the women came, carrying the god, and to the abode of Aristaeus, who dwelt in a cave on the top of a mountain at Caryae and who instructed the life of country-dwelling men in countless things; he was the first to establish a flock of sheep; he first pressed the fruit of the oily wild olive, first curdled milk with rennet, and brought the gentle bees from the oak and shut them up in hives. He at that time received the infant Dionysus from coffer of Ino and reared him in his cave and nursed him with the help of the Dryads and the Nymphs that have the bees in their keeping and the maidens of Euboea and the Aonian women.

=== Nonnus&#x27; account ===
In Nonnus, Dionysiaca 5.212, the marriage of Aristaeus and Autonoë and the fate of their son Actaeon was described in the following lines:

: Kadmos (Cadmus) [king of Thebes] now chose husbands for his daughters, and gave them over in four successive bridals, settling their weddings one by one. First Aristaios (Aristaeus) laden with gifts, he of the herds and he of the wilds, as he was named, the flood of allwise Apollon and Kyrene (Cyrene) so ready with her hands, wedded Autonoe according to the rules of lawful marriage. Agenorides (Kadmos son of Agenor) did not refuse his daughter to a good son well acquainted with the art of feeding many; nay, he gave her to a very clever husband, a lifesaving son of Apollon, after he head calmed the pestilential star of fiery Maira [Sirius the Dog Star] by the life-preserving breezes of heaven-sent [Etesian] winds. The wedding-feast also was very rich, since he gave the unyoked maid oxen for her treasure, he gave goats, he gave mountain-bred flocks; many a line of burden-bearers was forced to lift the load of great jars full of olive-oil, his marriage gifts, much travail of the clever honeybee he brought, in the riddled comb her masterpiece . . . [the blessings that Aristaios conferred on man follow, see the Blessings of Aristaios below.]&quot;
: This was he, the Keian (Cean) son of Phoibos (Phoebus), whom Eros (Love) escorted to the Aonian wedding. All the city [of Thebes] wreathed in garlands was busy about the cattle-sacrifice, and the straighcut streets were all busy dancing. Before the gates of the bridal chamber the people twirled their reeling legs for the wedding; the women struck up a lovely sounding noise of melody, the Aionian hoboys tootled with the bridal pipes.
: Afterwards from the bed of Aristaios and Autonoe, arose Aktaion (Actaeon). His passion was for the rocks; and having in him the blood of the Hunter. . . [But he once came across Artemis bathing naked, was transformed into a stag and torn apart by his own hounds.]
: Pheme (Rumour) self born had flown from the hills to Autonoe, proclaiming her son&#x27;s [Aktaion&#x27;s] fate torn to pieces by his dogs . . . Old Kadmos shore off his hoary hair, Harmonia cried aloud; the whole house resounded heavy booming with the noise of women wailing in concert. Autonoe along with Aristaios her husband went in search of the scattered remains of the dead. She saw her son, but knew him not; she beheld the shape of a dappled deer and saw no aspect of a man. Often she passed the bones of a fawn unrecognized, lying on the ground, and did not understand; for her boy was dead, and she looked to find him in human shape . . . Passing over the forest ridges with wandering feet, she trod the rough back of the rugged hill, unshod, with loosened robe, and returned home form the mountain ranging task; grieving for her unsuccessful cares she fell asleep at last beside her husband, unhappy father! Both were haunted by shadowy dreams, their eyes glimpsing the wing of a nightingale sleep.
: The young man&#x27;s ghost stood by his disconsolate father, wearing the shadowy form of a dappled stag; but from his eyelids he poured tears of understanding and spoke with a human voice : ‘You sleep, my father, and you know not my fate. Wake, and recognise my unknown changeling looks; wake, and embrace the horn of a stag you love . . . [Aktaion tells his father the circumstances of his death and requests proper burial.] I heard that Phoibos, the Archeress&#x27;s brother, slept with Kyrene and begat my father, and I thought to draw Artemis to marriage in the family . . .
: So spoke the dream the intelligent pricket, and without warning it was flown and gone. Autonoe&#x27;s husband leapt up, and threw off the wing of this revealing sleep. He aroused his wife much disturbed, and described her boy&#x27;s strong-horned animal form, and recounted the story which the intelligent fawn had told. Then there was more lamentation.

<text>In Greek mythology, Nisos or Nisus (Ancient Greek: Νῖσος) was a King of Megara.

== Family ==
Nisos was one of the four sons of Pandion II, King of Athens, and Pylia, daughter of King Pylas of Megara. He was the brother of Aegeas, Pallas, Lykos and the wife of Sciron. According to Hyginus, Nisus&#x27;s father was the god Ares while other authors affirmed that he was the offspring of Deion.

Nisos was married to Abrota, sister of Megareus, and when she died, Nisos commanded that the Megarian women should wear clothes like she had. His daughter Eurynome, with Poseidon, had the famous son Bellerophon. The second daughter Iphinoe married Megareus, her maternal uncle. Lastly, the third princess Scylla was responsible for Nisos&#x27; death.

== Mythology ==

=== Early days ===
Metion, the uncle of Nisos, had seized the throne from Pandion II. However, upon their father&#x27;s death, Nisos and his brothers returned to Athens and took back control. They drove out the sons of Metion, put Aegeus on the throne, and divided the government in four. Aegeas became king of Athens, and Nisos the King of Megara.

=== War with Minos ===
Minos, King of Crete, attacked Nisos&#x27;s kingdom during a war with Athens over the death of his son Androgeus. Nisos however had a lock of purple hair that kept him safe from harm. Eros caused his daughter Scylla to fall in love with Minos. In one version, Minos tempts Scylla with a golden necklace to betray and kill her father. In another version, she fell in love with Minos from a distance, and after cutting off the purple lock, she presented it to Minos. However, Minos was disgusted with her act, calling her a disgrace. As Minos&#x27;s ships set sail, Scylla attempted to climb up one of them. But Nisos, who had turned into a sea eagle or osprey, attacked her. His daughter transformed into a bird as well. There is also a version with Ares. According to another account Nisos killed himself when he lost his vital lock of hair.

<text>In Greek mythology, Metion (; Ancient Greek: Μητίων, &quot;gen&quot;. Μητίονος) was an Athenian prince as the son of King Erechtheus and Praxithea, daughter of Phrasimus and Diogeneia.

== Family ==
Metion was the brother of Cecrops, Pandorus, Protogeneia, Pandora, Creusa, Procris, Oreithyia and Chthonia. His other possible siblings were Merope, Orneus, Thespius, Eupalamus and Sicyon. 

In some accounts, Metion&#x27;s father was Eupalamus, son of Erechtheus, instead. He had sons known collectively as the Metionadae which probably include Eupalamus, Sicyon, and Daedalus (his son by Iphinoe). These mentioned sons are sometimes credited with other parentages.

== Mythology ==
The Metionids later drove King Pandion II out of Athens into exile. These usurping sons were in turn overthrown by the sons of Pandion: Aegeus, Nisus, Lycus and Pallas.

<text>In Greek mythology, Aethalides (; Ancient Greek: Αἰθαλίδης) was one of the Argonauts together with his paternal step-brothers Erytus and Echion. He was a son of Hermes and Eupolemeia, a daughter of King Myrmidon of Phthia. Aethalides was born near the streams of Amphrysus.

== Mythology ==
Aethalides was the herald of the Argonauts, and had received from his father the faculty of remembering everything, even in Hades. He was further allowed to reside alternately in the upper and in the lower world. As his soul could not forget anything even after death, it remembered that from the body of Aethalides it had successively migrated into those of Euphorbus, Hermotimus, Pyrrhus, and at last into that of Pythagoras, in whom it still retained the recollection of its former migrations.

<doc id="83168" wikidata="Q3083" url="?curid=83168" title="Ain">
<text>Ain (, ; ) is a French department in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, Eastern France. Named after the Ain river, it is bordered by the Saône and Rhône rivers. Ain is located on the country&#x27;s eastern edge, on the Swiss border, where it neighbours the cantons of Geneva and Vaud. In 2019, it had a population of 652,432.

Ain is composed of four geographically different areas (Bresse, Dombes, Bugey and Pays de Gex), each of which contribute to the diverse and dynamic economic development of the department. In Bresse, agriculture and agro-industry are dominated by the cultivation of cereals, cattle breeding, milk and cheese production as well as poultry farming. In Dombes, pisciculture assumes greater importance, as does winemaking in Bugey.

Ain&#x27;s prefecture is Bourg-en-Bresse. It is bordered by Jura to the north; Saône-et-Loire to the northwest; Rhône and the Lyon Metropolis to the southwest; Isère to the south; Savoie, Haute-Savoie and Switzerland to the east.

In the alphabetical ordering of French departments, used for postal and demographic purposes amongst others, Ain comes first and is thus assigned the number 01 as its department number.

== History ==

The first inhabitants settled in the territory of today&#x27;s Ain about 15000 BC. The menhir of in Simandre-sur-Suran dates from the mid-Neolithic era, in the fourth or third millennium BC. The late-second century BC Calendar of Coligny bears the oldest surviving Gaulish inscription.

In 58 BC, Julius Caesar&#x27;s military action against the Helvetians, advancing through Gaul over the territory of today&#x27;s Ain, marked the beginning of the Gallic Wars.

Under the Merovingians, the four historic regions of the modern department belonged to the Kingdom of Burgundy. At the start of the 6th century AD, the diocese of Belley (&quot;Bellicum&quot;) was created as the first bishopric in the region. Abbeys of the order of Saint Benedict were established in the valleys.

In 843, the Treaty of Verdun assigned the territories that comprised Ain to the kingdom of Lothar I (Lotharingia). The first big fiefdoms (&quot;seigneuries&quot;) emerged between 895 and 900 in Bâgé-le-Châtel, which formed the nucleus of the &quot;pays&quot; of Bresse, and in Coligny. Numerous castles were erected in a low rolling terrain that was not otherwise easily defended. In the 12th century, Romanesque architecture flourished.

In the 11th century, the Counts of Savoy and Valromey settled in the region of Belley. In 1272, when Sibylle de Bâgé, sole heir, married Amadeus V, Count of Savoy, they added Bresse to their domains, and – by the Treaties of Paris in 1355 – the territories of Dauphiné and Gex on the right bank of the Rhône.

At the start of the 15th century, almost the whole region of Ain was united under the house of Savoy. New monasteries were founded in the cities and churches were constructed or reshaped in the Gothic style of architecture.
At the start of the 16th century, the Duchy of Savoy was at the peak of its power and Ain was inherited by Margaret of Habsburg, the widow of Philibert II, Duke of Savoy. In Brou, she erected a church and a monastery in late-Gothic style. Bourg-en-Bresse became a bishop&#x27;s see. After Margaret&#x27;s death, Francis I of France, a nephew of the Dukes of Savoy, claimed the Duchy for himself and conquered it in 1536. Following a treaty concluded in 1559 at Savoy, the territory of Ain was restored to the Duke of Savoy, who immediately started fortifying it. During the Franco-Savoyard War of 1600–1601, Henri IV of France reconquered the region, although the citadel of Bourg remained impregnable. The Treaty of Lyon of 17 January 1601 finally ended the conflict. Ain now belonged to Burgundy.

In the 17th century, sculpture, painting, and literature prospered. During the 18th century, streets and small industries emerged. On 28 March 1762, the Count of Eu, son of the Duke of Maine, ceded the region of Dombes to Louis XV.

In 1790, during the French Revolution, the departments of Ain and Léman were created. Ain was subdivided into nine districts, 49 cantons (now 23 cantons) and 501 communes. The Revolution did not claim many victims in the department, but it destroyed numerous valuable historical monuments. During the first French Consulate (1802), the districts were abolished. The Congress of Vienna dissolved the department of Léman and assigned the arrondissement of Gex to the department of Ain. However, 7 communes of Gex was given to Geneva for linking Canton of Geneva with rest of Switzerland after signing second Treaty of Paris signed on November 20, 1815: Bellevue, Collex-Bossy, Meyrin, Pregny, Grand-Saconnex, Vernier and finally Versoix. 

During the French Revolution and the First Empire, a large number of churches were destroyed, but in 1823 the diocese of Belley was refounded. The Curé of Ars became famous. During the Second French Empire, numerous churches were rebuilt, agriculture changed profoundly, and the railways expanded.

Due to its distance from the front line, the department was spared the destruction of World War I (1914–1918). However, the majority of the vineyards could no longer be cultivated, and disappeared. Industrialization of the department began in Oyonnax and Bellegarde. Construction of the Barrage de Génissiat started in 1937.

World War II (1939–1945) vehemently struck the department of Ain and took its toll as 600 people were deported, half whom did not return. Commemorating this tragic era are: the monument of the Maquis in Cerdon, the memorial of the children of Izieu, and the museum of the resistance and deportation in Nantua.

In the second half of the 20th century, industrialisation of the department proceeded, favoured by an expansive road and railway network.

== Geography ==


Ain is a department of geographic contrasts. In the north, the plain of Bresse is bordered by the river Saône and rises slightly towards the north-east. In the south-east, the territory of Dombes has more than a thousand ponds and lakes. In the east, the mountain chain of the southern Jura overlooks the plain of Bresse. The busy transport axes to Italy and Switzerland crisscross the valleys. The Gex region is separated from the rest of the department by the last eastern mountain chain of the Jura where the highest elevation in the department, the Crêt de la Neige (1720 m), can be found. Gex belongs geographically to the Lake Geneva basin.

The river Saône represents the western border of the department. It is fed by three smaller rivers: the Reyssouze (76 km), the Veyle (68 km) and the Chalaronne (52 km). The river Rhône forms the department&#x27;s borders in the east and the south. Its main tributaries are the Suran (50 km) and notably the river Ain (190 km) which is itself fed by 118 small rivers and creeks.

===Principal communes===

The most populous commune is the prefecture Bourg-en-Bresse. As of 2019, there are 8 communes with more than 10,000 inhabitants:

=== Transport networks ===
Ain is situated at the crossroads of a large national and international flow of commodities and is therefore an important transit region. More than 4000 km of transport routes serve the department. In addition to a well-developed transport network of former national roads, which were transferred to the department in 2007, Ain is crisscrossed by 220 km of highway.

For national and international flights, the international airports of Lyon (Saint-Exupéry) and Geneva (Cointrin) are located within a rather short distance. The department of Ain also contains two waterways, the rivers Saône and Rhone, on which building materials, such as gravel, are shipped. The most important harbour is situated in Jassans-Riottier on the river Saône.

The railway network is of great importance, in particular the TGV connections Paris–Geneva (with a stop in Bellegarde-sur-Valserine) and Paris–Lyon (passing by the Saône valley). The upgraded Ligne du Haut-Bugey was opened in 2010, reducing travel time between Paris and Geneva by 20 minutes. The regional TER (train and bus) network is important mainly as concerns the connection to Lyon.

== Demographics ==
The department of Ain is marked by very dynamic demographics. The population has grown from 471,019 inhabitants in 1990 to 638,425 in 2016 (estimates of the French statistics office INSEE). This increase is primarily due to natural growth and secondarily by a slightly positive migration balance.

The average population density is 111 inhabitants/km2 (2016; Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes: 114; metropolitan France: 119). While the Saône valley, the Côtière, Bourg-en-Bresse and the Gex region have a high density of population, the mountainous Bugey area is less populated.

Population development since 1791:

== Higher education and research ==
Several colleges and research institutions are located in Bourg-en-Bresse, as well as one in Bellignat. In Bourg-en-Bresse, they include the Centre for University Studies, Alimentec, the Ecole Supérieure de Plasturgie, the commercial college of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce, and a branch of the Lyon faculty of education. Bellignat is home of the polytechnic for plastics engineering.

The Centre for University Studies, which was relocated from the University Jean Moulin in Lyon to Bourg-en-Bresse, has 540 students who pursue their studies in 6 different branches. They are: modern foreign languages, being English-German and English-Spanish; economic and social administration; business administration; and 3 levels of study in law. Law students may gain a diploma after 2 years of law study, a &#x27;licence&#x27; after 3 years, or a Maîtrise after 4 years. This last corresponds to a master&#x27;s degree in law and offers a specialization in commercial and trade law.

At Alimentec, altogether 700 students attend courses. Two streams of study can be followed, applied nutritional sciences or towards qualification by the commercial college of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce. The research and technology centre for applied nutritional sciences located in Bourg-en-Bresse has faculties for biology, energy sciences, informatics and biotechnology.

Also situated in Bourg-en-Bresse is a branch of the Lyon faculty of education, providing 450 places for future school teachers.

In Bellignat, at the heart of the &#x27;plastics valley&#x27;, a polytechnic university was founded in 1992, under the direct control of the Ministry of youth, education and research. The Ecole Supérieure de Plasturgie provides 140 places for future plastics engineers and utilizes a pluridisciplinary research laboratory which qualifies advanced students, notably PhD students.

Although it is headquartered just across the border in Geneva, most of CERN&#x27;s Large Hadron Collider lies in parts of several communes in the Arrondissement of Gex in Ain.

== Economy ==
=== General data ===
With an unemployment rate of only 5% (compared to 7% in the Rhône-Alpes region and 8% in France), a close-knit community of 11,500 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and a fast-growing, export-oriented economy, mainly to Germany, Italy and Spain, Ain is one of the most dynamic regions in France.

=== Industry ===
Despite its rural image, Ain is highly industrialised. In addition to a multitude of SME&#x27;s, several big enterprises of international reputation are situated in Ain, such as: Roset-Cinna, Grosfillex, Volvo, Carrier, Smoby-Berchet, CIAT, Renault Trucks, Tréfileurope. With more than a third of all employees working in the industrial and public works sector, Ain holds 6th rank of all departments in regards to the degree of industrialisation and is the most industrialised department within the Rhône-Alpes region. The small and medium enterprises contribute most to the industrial development of the department. While enterprises with more than 500 employees represent only 27% of all industrial employment, businesses with less than 100 employees account for 47%.

The plastics industry, which is located mainly around the city of Oyonnax, is a highly productive branch of the economy and enjoys an excellent reputation. &quot;Plastics Valley&quot; comprises 10% of France&#x27;s plastics industry which constitutes the highest concentration of plastics enterprises in Europe. The 349 enterprises which have been established here employ about 11,000 persons, more than a fourth of all employees of the tertiary sector (without public works). In the Oyonnax basin, three of four employments are directly or indirectly depending on the plastics industry.

The agricultural industry, mainly located in Bresse, accounts for more than 5,000 employees. It represents more than a fifth of the employees in the area of Bourg-en-Bresse who work in the meat industry and in tinned food factories. The pillars of the agro-industry are an efficient agriculture providing for a significant number of high quality products as well as the presence of several leading companies of this branch. The emblematic poultry industry in Bresse employs only 350 persons.

In 1992 the city of Bourg-en-Bresse, the department of Ain, and the local Chamber of Industry and Commerce founded the technology platform &quot;Alimentec&quot;. Its tasks are, among others, applied research, technical support, technology transfer and the advanced technical education in the agro-industrial sector. The activities of Alimentec focus on three priorities: ventilation systems, plastics packing and applied hygiene.

The industrial fabric of Ain is also a result of its metal processing (cables, wire drawing, electrical wires) and engineering industry (automobile industry, France&#x27;s most important site for truck production) as shown by the presence of several major companies in this sector (Tréfileurope, Alcatel Cables, Renault Trucks). Foundry, metal processing and electrical industry employ approximately 8,200 workers. Due to the diversity of the activities of these industries and their dispersion over the whole department, polarisation effects similar to those in the plastics sector have not yet been observed.

Counting more than 12,900 employees, the public works sector represents a significant share of the department&#x27;s economy. About a quarter of all industry employees are working in this sector. The future development of the building sector benefits from the department&#x27;s economic and demographic growth.

Thanks to its vast forests (more than a third of the department&#x27;s land area), the timber industry employed (in September 2007) approximately 4,500 workers.

The nuclear industry represents another economic factor. The nuclear power plant in Bugey produces about 4.2% of French electricity, employs more than 1,350 workers and secures moreover numerous employments in the enterprises of the supply chain. Every day between 300 and 1,000 external employees work in the power plant. Its importance for the local economy can not be underestimated.

Ain comprises, finally, several industrial parks. Apart from the aforementioned Plastics Valley and numerous smaller business parks which have been founded by local initiatives, the large industrial park of the plain of Ain has to be mentioned. With 700 ha, this park is forecast to become a centre for heavy industries in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region.

=== Agriculture ===

The diversified agriculture (cattle and poultry breeding, milk and milk products, cereals, vegetables and viticulture) generates products of national and international reputation. In particular are the Bresse poultries (&quot;volaille de Bresse&quot;), blue cheese (&quot;Bleu&quot;) of Gex, Grièges and Bresse, carps and sturgeons of the Dombes region as well as the wine of Bugey.

The total number of farms in the department amounts to 5,170, including 2,750 full-time farms. Over the previous 25 years the number of farms has steadily diminished. While there were 14,600 farms in 1979, only 11,320 were counted in 1988 and 6,320 in 2000. The total farm land of the department amounts to 268,361 ha, containing 150,917 ha arable farm land and 118,000 plant cultures (range land, viticulture, fruit meadows, tree nurseries). The value of the department&#x27;s agricultural production reached €545 million. 52% of this amount (€274 million) is allotted to animal products (cattle, sheep, pigs, poultry, carp, milk) and 44% (€240 million) concern crop (cereals, oil plants, wine, vegetables, flowers).

=== Commerce ===
The commercial sector comprises 5,861 enterprises including 717 wholesalers and distributors (12.2%), 539 automobile dealers and garages as well as 1,643 retailers and repair businesses (28%) (source: Chamber of Industry and Commerce of Ain, 2006).

With a total of 22,973 employees and 9,000 self-employed persons, the commercial sector contributes significantly to overall employment in the department (source: Chamber of Industry and Commerce of Ain, 2006).

More than three-thirds of the expenses of the private households amounting to €4.4 billion per year are feeding the commercial businesses inside the department which stand their ground vis-à-vis external competition.

=== Services ===
The strongly expanding services sector represents 46.6% of all enterprises and about 55,000 employees (source: Chamber of Industry and Commerce of Ain, 2006). Since 2003, the services branch has employed more people than any other economic sector. Within the sector, services for enterprises represent 32.2% of the employees. Consulting and IT services are of growing importance. Educational services as well as health and social services are also sought after. They represent about a quarter of all employees in the services sector.

=== Handcraft ===
More than 9,000 handcraft businesses in Ain highlight the particular economic importance of this sector. The handcraft, which employs approximately 29,000 persons, has always been an essential element of the local economy. Within the sector, the production is of particular importance, followed by the construction, the services and the alimentary sector.

=== Tourism ===
In economic terms, tourism in Ain means €300 million of business volume and 10,000 direct jobs as well as another 10,000 indirect employments. In December 2006, 2.9% of the department&#x27;s employment was related to the tourist sector (source: Committee for Tourism in the Department of Ain, 2006).

In 2006, 700,000 tourists visited sites of interest in the department (museums, castles, religious monuments, gardens and caves). During the winter of 2006/2007, winter sports activity was strongly restrained by the lack of snow. The number of daily skiing tourists amounted to 238,000 (180,500 for alpine skiing and 57,000 for cross-country skiing). The previous average amounted to 465,000 daily tourists per winter.

Angling and cycling tourism (27 circuits with altogether more than 1,500 km) attracts numerous visitors each year. The hotel and hospitality sector counts about 1,100 establishments (hotels, camping grounds, bed and breakfast (so-called &quot;gîtes&quot;), holiday apartments, guest rooms etc.). Their joined capacity amounts to 40,850 beds. During the 2006 season, 2.5 million nights were spent in the department compared to 2.7 million in 2002 (source: Committee for Tourism in the Department of Ain, 2006). 15,000 hunters are registered in the department, 3,000 to 4,000 of whom hunt in Dombes, one of the best hunting regions for water birds in France.

<text>Aisne ( , ; ; ) is a French department in the Hauts-de-France region of northern France. It is named after the river Aisne. In 2020, it had a population of 529,374.

== Geography ==
The department borders Nord (to the north), Somme and Oise (to the west), Ardennes and Marne (east), and Seine-et-Marne (south-west) and Belgium (Province of Hainaut) (to the north-east). The river Aisne crosses the area from east to west, where it joins the Oise. The Marne forms part of the southern boundary of the department with the department of Seine-et-Marne. The southern part of the department is the geographical region known as &quot;la Brie poilleuse&quot;, a drier plateau known for its dairy products and Brie cheese.

According to the 2003 census, the forested area of the department was 123,392 hectares, or 16.6% for an average metropolitan area of 27.4%.

The landscape is dominated by masses of rock which often have steep flanks. These rocks appear all over the region, but the most impressive examples are at Laon and the Chemin des Dames ridge.

===Principal towns===

The department of Aisne includes one medium-sized city (Saint-Quentin) and three small cities (Laon, Soissons and Château-Thierry) to which may be added the conglomeration formed by Chauny and Tergnier. There are many other agglomerations of an urban character because Aisne has been densely populated since before the 19th century. The villages are numerous and rather small. The most populous commune is Saint-Quentin; the prefecture Laon is the third-most populous. As of 2019, there are 7 communes with more than 10,000 inhabitants:

See also: List of the communes of the Aisne department.

===Hydrography===
The Scheldt (which takes its source near Le Catelet), the Aisne, the Marne, the Ourcq, the Vesle, the Somme (which rises in Fonsommes), the Oise, and the Serre. In the south of the department, there is the &quot;Surmelin&quot;, the Verdonnelle, and the &quot;Dhuys&quot; (this river is channeled into the Dhuis Aqueduct, 131 km long, to supply drinking water to Paris since 1 October 1865 and also more recently the Leisure Park of Marne-la-Vallée).

The department is also crossed by numerous canals (e.g. the Canal of Saint-Quentin, 93 km).

===Climate===
There is an average of 500 to 750 mm precipitation annually.

==Transport==
===Railways===
The department is crossed by three railway lines from Paris: the first two from the Gare du Nord and the third from the Gare de l&#x27;Est:
* the line from Paris to Maubeuge, serving cities including Chauny, Tergnier and Saint-Quentin
* the line from Paris to Laon, serving cities including Soissons, Anizy-le-Château, and Laon (prefecture)
* the line from Paris to Strasbourg, serving the city of Château-Thierry.

In 1873, the department of Aisne had 10 railway companies with a total length of 382 km.

== History ==
Aisne developed from the ancient settlement of Acinum, from which its name derives. The Battle of the Axona was fought nearby in 57 BC.

Aisne is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790. It was created from parts of the former provinces of Île-de-France (Laon, Soissons, Noyon, and Valois, which are actually historical and cultural parts of Picardy that were annexed to Île-de-France), Picardy (Thiérache Vermandois), and Champagne (Brie, and Omois).

Most of the old growth forests in the area were destroyed during battles in World War I. The French offensive against the Chemin des Dames in spring 1917 is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Second Battle of the Aisne&quot;.

==Heraldry==
== Economy ==
Agriculture dominates the economy, especially cereal crops. Beet sugar is one of the most important industrial crops of the area. Silk, cotton, and wool weaving flourish in Saint-Quentin and other towns. Saint-Gobain is known for its production of mirrors, which started in the 17th century. Guise is the agricultural centre of the northern area of Aisne. Volkswagen Group France has headquarters in Villers-Cotterêts.

==Politics==
The department is a mixture of rural areas and working-class towns. As a place of residence for some families working in Paris or Île-de-France, Aisne was for many years a department rather oriented to the left, with a majority on the General Council on the left since 1998, and the same for the majority of parliamentary seats representing the department in the National Assembly. However, since the 2000s, Aisne has strongly shifted in favour of the National Rally. Indeed, Aisne is the department that was most favourable to this party during the 2012 presidential elections, having won 26.33% of votes there. 

In 2017, Aisne votes 52.91% in favour of the National Rally during the second round. In 2022, this value was 7 points higher, at 59.91%;

The smaller cities of the northern department such as Guise, Hirson, Vervins and the railway city of Tergnier are sources of support for left-wing parties.

=== Departmental Council ===

The President of the General Council is the Liberal Nicolas Fricoteaux. In the 2021 departmental election, the Departmental Council of Aisne was elected as follows:

=== Presidential elections 2nd round ===

In the second round of the French presidential elections of 2017 Aisne was one of only two departments (along nearby Pas-de-Calais) in which the candidate of the Front National, Marine Le Pen, received a majority of the votes cast: 52.91%. In the second round of the 2022 French presidential election, Aisne was the mainland departement with the highest percentage support for her.

== Representatives in the National Assembly ==
==Administration==
Aisne is divided into five arrondissements and 21 cantons. The department has 798 communes and five parliamentary constituencies.

==Demography==

Aisne lost some of its population in the second half of the 19th century, due to the rural exodus but this was limited by the industrial development in the north of the department (Saint-Quentin, Chaunois, Thiérache).

Greatly affected by the First World War, the department has seen its population grow slightly to the same level as in 1900. For thirty years, the industrial decline has caused stagnation of the population (526,346 in 1968, 535,489 in 1999). Only the south-west of the department, close to the Paris conurbation, has seen much population growth.

Population development since 1791:

==Tourism==


The boat tours relates in part to the Canal de Saint-Quentin with its electric towage and two tunnels (Lesdins and Riqueval/Vendhuile).

In 2007, a large infrastructure for tourist accommodation, the Center Parcs, was built on the Lake of Ailette, close to many tourist attractions such as the Cathedral of Laon, the Chemin des Dames and the Château de Coucy.

Among the many places to explore are:

; Monuments
* Castle of Villers-Cotterets at Château-Thierry

* Dungeon of Septmonts
* Château of Guise

* Quentin de Latour Museum in Saint-Quentin
* Musée du cheminot, the &quot;Familistère de Godin&quot; at Guise.

In 2020, the department had 3.4% of second homes.

== Culture ==
During World War I a number of significant architectural monuments were destroyed. Of the buildings that survived, the medieval churches in Laon, Braine, and Urcel are the most significant. The ruined castle of La Ferté-Milon escaped further damage during the war. Of the castles that survived, some were used as prisons, such as the Castle of Vadancourt, near Saint-Quentin (500 prisoners).

It is thought that the Aisne River was the birthplace of the trench warfare seen in the First World War. The British Expeditionary Force (BEF) had initial early successes driving the Germans back to the Aisne River; the German troops dug in and managed to hold out against both British and French attacks. This German entrenchment was to mould the entire face of World War One as both sides began digging in and fortifying their positions. Thus began the stalemate that became a significant feature of the First World War.

===Languages===
* Picard in the north
* Champenois dialect in the south
* the French of Île-de-France in the centre and the south.

This linguistic variance probably explains the difficulty for residents south of Aisne to identify themselves as belonging to the Picardy region.

===Gastronomy===

* Rustic cuisine. The north of the department is a farming area and there are products made from cow&#x27;s milk such as Maroilles cheese and Dulce de leche. There are also typically Picardy specialties such as &quot;ficelle&quot;, a sort of rolled crêpe with cream cheese, béchamel, ham, and mushrooms. Foie gras is a product developed in Thiérache of the highest quality.
* The cultivation of red fruit (strawberries) is beginning to develop.
* Trade shows for: cheeses (La Capelle), blood sausage (Saint-Quentin).
* Tastings in flea markets and many opportunities to discover local products in a traditional atmosphere.
* In the south there are kidney beans form Soissons and the Tourist route of Champagne where some champagnes produced in the Chateau-Thierry region, like the maroilles, are recognized by the Appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée (AOC).
* Thiérache cider and its eau-de-vie and the production of beer (mostly craft) give the department of Aisne real identity.
* Large swarms of bees mean that the flavours of honey, mead, gingerbread, vinegar etc. can be found.

==Notable people==
* Camille Desmoulins (1760–1794), revolutionary politician and journalist, was from Guise

<text>In Greek mythology, Agamedes (, &quot;Agamēdēs&quot;) was a son of Erginus (or, according to some traditions, the son of Stymphalus and grandson of Arcas).

== Family ==
Agamedes was father of Cercyon by Epicaste, who also brought to him a stepson, Trophonius, who was by some believed to be a son of Apollo. According to others, Agamedes was a son of Apollo and Epicaste, or of Zeus and Iocaste, and father of Trophonius. In the most common accounts, Trophonius was his brother.

== Mythology ==
The two brothers are said to have distinguished themselves as architects, especially in building temples and palaces. They built Apollo&#x27;s temple housing the oracle of Delphi. A tradition mentioned by Pindar states that Agamedes and Trophonius, after having built this temple, prayed to the god to grant them in reward for their labor what was best for men. The oracle told the brothers that they would get their reward after seven days and should do whatsoever they wished for until then. They did and were found dead in their beds on the seventh night. Cicero mentions the same story, only shortening the number of days to three. This may connect to the saying of Menander that “those whom the gods love die young.”

They also built a treasury of Hyrieus, king of Hyria in Boeotia. The scholiast on Aristophanes gives a somewhat different account from Charax of Pergamum, and makes them build the treasury for King Augeas. The story about this treasury in Pausanias bears a great resemblance to that which Herodotus relates of the treasury of the Egyptian king Rhampsinit. In the construction of the treasury of Hyrieus, Agamedes and Trophonius contrived to place one stone in such a manner that it could be taken away outside, and thus formed an entrance to the treasury, without anybody perceiving it. Agamedes and Trophonius constantly robbed the treasury; and the king, seeing that locks and seals were uninjured while his treasures were constantly decreasing, set traps to catch the thief. Agamedes was caught in one of these snares, and with profound grief, Trophonius cut off his head to keep Agamedes&#x27;s identity secret.

After this, Trophonius was immediately swallowed up by the earth and turned into an immortal subterranean god. On this spot there was afterwards, in the grove of Lebadeia, the so-called cave of Agamedes, with a column by the side of it. Here also was the oracle of Trophonius, and those who consulted it first offered a ram to Agamedes and invoked the deified man.

The question as to whether the story about the Egyptian treasury is derived from Greece, or whether the Greek story was an importation from Egypt, has been answered by modern scholars in both ways; but Müller has rendered it very probable that the tradition took its rise among the Minyans, was transferred from them to Augeas, and was known in Greece long before the reign of Psammetichus I, during which the intercourse between the two countries was opened.

==In popular culture==
*In The Dark Prophecy, Agamedes is shown to be an orange-colored ghost with the name of Agamethus. He lives in the Waystation and helps Apollo throughout the book. At the end of the book, he leaves Waystation to find his half-brother, Trophonius.

<text>Laon () is a city in the Aisne department in Hauts-de-France in northern France.

==History==

===Early history===
The Ancient Diocese of Laon, which rises a hundred metres above the otherwise flat Picardy plain, has always held strategic importance. In the time of Julius Caesar there was a Gallic village named Bibrax where the Remis (inhabitants of the country round Reims) had to meet the onset of the confederated Belgae. Whatever may have been the precise locality of that battlefield, Laon was fortified by the Romans, and successively checked the invasions of the Franks, Burgundians, Vandals, Alans and Huns. At that time it was known as &quot;Alaudanum&quot; or &quot;Lugdunum Clavatum&quot;.

Archbishop Remigius of Reims, who baptised Clovis, was born in the Laonnais, and it was he who, at the end of the fifth century, instituted the bishopric of Laon. Thenceforward Laon was one of the principal towns of the kingdom of the Franks, and the possession of it was often disputed. Charles the Bald had enriched its church with the gift of very numerous domains. In about 847 the Irish philosopher John Scotus Eriugena appeared at the court of Charles the Bald, and was appointed head of the palace school. Eriugena spent the rest of his days in France, probably at Paris and Laon.

Laon was the principal city of the late Carolingian kings of France, beginning with Louis IV. After the fall of the Carolingians, Laon took the part of Charles of Lorraine, their heir, and Hugh Capet only succeeded in making himself master of the town by the connivance of the bishop, who, in return for this service, was made second ecclesiastical peer of the kingdom.

Early in the twelfth century the communes of France set about emancipating themselves, and the history of the commune of Laon is one of the richest and most varied. Anselm of Laon&#x27;s school for theology and exegesis rapidly became the most famous in Europe. The citizens had profited by a temporary absence of Bishop Gaudry to secure from his representatives a communal charter, but he, on his return, purchased from the king of France the revocation of this document, and recommenced his oppressions. The consequence was a revolt, in which the episcopal palace was burnt and the bishop and several of his partisans were put to death on 25 April 1112. The fire spread to Laon Cathedral, and reduced it to ashes. Uneasy at the result of their victory, the rioters went into hiding outside the town, which was anew pillaged by the people of the neighbourhood, eager to avenge the death of their bishop.

Thereafter, French monarchs intervened as needed to settle disputes between the bishop and the townspeople until 1331, when the commune was abolished. In the latter stages of the 1337–1453 Hundred Years&#x27; War, Laon was captured by Philip, Duke of Burgundy; he relinquished control to his English allies, who held it until 1429 when it fell to Charles VII of France. The Catholic League used the town as a base during the French Wars of Religion; it was retaken by the former Huguenot Henry IV in August 1594.

===Modern history===
At the Revolution (1789) Laon permanently lost its rank as a bishopric. During the campaign of 1814, Napoleon tried in vain to dislodge Blücher and Bülow from it in the Battle of Laon.

In 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War, an engineer blew up the powder magazine of the citadel at the moment when the German troops were entering the town. Many people died; and the cathedral and the old episcopal palace were damaged. It surrendered to a German force on 9 September 1870.

In the fall of 1914, during World War I, German forces captured the town and held it until the Allied offensive in the summer of 1918.

==Geography==
Located in the middle of Aisne, Laon borders (from the north, clockwise) with the municipalities of Aulnois-sous-Laon, Barenton-Bugny, Chambry, Athies-sous-Laon, Bruyères-et-Montbérault, Vorges, Presles-et-Thierny, Chivy-lès-Étouvelles, Clacy-et-Thierret, Molinchart, Cerny-lès-Bucy, and Besny-et-Loizy. It is from Reims, from Amiens, and from Paris.

==Population==

==Sights==

The city contains numerous medieval buildings, including the cathedral Notre-Dame of Laon, dating mostly from the 12th and 13th centuries. The chapter-house and the cloister contain specimens of early 13th-century architecture. The old episcopal palace, contiguous to the cathedral, is now used as a court-house. The front, flanked by turrets, is pierced by large pointed windows. There is also a Gothic cloister and an old chapel of two storeys, of a date anterior to the cathedral.

The church of St Martin dates from the middle of the 12th century. The old abbey buildings of the same foundation are now used as the hospital. The museum of Laon had collections of sculpture and painting. In its garden there is a chapel of the Templars belonging to the 12th century.

One of the oldest churches in the city is St John the Baptist, in the nearby neighbourhood of Vaux-sous-Laon, which dates from the 11th through 13th centuries and is built in a mixture of Romanesque and Gothic styles.

==Transportation==
Laon railway station offers connections to Reims, Soissons and Paris.

Until August 2016, the town had the only fully automated municipal cable car system in the world, called the Poma 2000. It linked the upper town (the historical centre, located on a plateau) with the lower town, had three stations and ran on rubber tyres. In contrast, the San Francisco cable car system is manually operated, and most other automated cable car systems have restricted operations within airports and hospitals, though another automated cable car called the Minimetrò may be found in the city of Perugia in Italy.

The town&#x27;s transport company TUL (Transports Urbains Laonnois) operates the local bus routes.

<text>Trophonius (; Ancient Greek: Τροφώνιος &quot;Trophōnios&quot;) was a Greek hero or daimon or god—it was never certain which one—with a rich mythological tradition and an oracular cult at Lebadaea (Λιβαδειά; &quot;Levadia&quot; or &quot;Livadeia&quot;) in Boeotia, Greece.

==Etymology and parallel cults==
The name is derived from τρέφω &quot;trepho&quot;, &quot;to nourish&quot;. Strabo and several inscriptions refer to him as Zeus Trephonios. Several other chthonic Zeuses are known from the Greek world, including Zeus Μειλίχιος &quot;Meilikhios&quot; (&quot;honeyed&quot; or &quot;kindly&quot; Zeus), and Zeus Χθόνιος &quot;Chthonios&quot; (&quot;Zeus beneath-the-earth&quot;), which were other names for Hades.

Similar constructions are also found in the Roman world. For example, a shrine at Lavinium in Lazio was dedicated to Aeneas under the title &quot;Iuppiter Indiges&quot; (Jupiter in-the-earth).

== Family ==
Trophonius was a son of Erginus, king of Minyan Orchomenus and brother of Agamedes. But Apollo is said to be his actual divine father.

==Mythology==
=== Temple of Apollo ===
According to the Homeric Hymn to Apollo, he built Apollo&#x27;s temple at the oracle at Delphi with Agamedes. Pindar relates how, once finished, the oracle told the brothers to do whatsoever they wished for six days and, on the seventh, they would get their reward. They did and were found dead on the seventh day. Cicero mentions the same story, only shortening the number of days to three. The maxim by Menander, &quot;those whom the gods love die young&quot;, may have come from this story.

=== Treasury of King Hyrieus ===
Alternatively, according to Pausanias they built a treasure chamber (with a secret entrance only they knew about) for King Hyrieus of Boeotia. Using the secret entrance, they stole Hyrieus&#x27; fortune. The king was aware but did not know who the thief was; he laid a snare. Agamedes was trapped in it; Trophonius cut off his head so that Hyrieus would not know whose body it was. He was then immediately swallowed up by the earth and was turned into an immortal subterranean god.

The cave of Trophonius was not discovered again until the Lebadaeans suffered a plague and consulted the Delphic Oracle. The Pythia advised them that an unnamed hero was angry at being neglected, and that they should find his grave and offer him worship forthwith. Several unsuccessful searches followed, and the plague continued unabated until a shepherd boy followed a trail of bees into a hole in the ground. Instead of honey, he found a &quot;daimon&quot;, and Lebadaea lost its plague while gaining a popular oracle.

=== Other myths ===
The childless Xuthus in Euripides&#x27;s &quot;Ion&quot; consults Trophonius on his way to Delphi.

Apollonius of Tyana, a legendary wise man and seer of Late Antiquity, once visited the shrine and found that, when it came to philosophy, Trophonius was a proponent of sound Pythagorean doctrines.

Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;De Genio Socratis&quot; relates an elaborate dream-vision concerning the cosmos and the afterlife that was supposedly received at Trophonius&#x27; oracle.

==Cult==
Pausanias, in his account of Boeotia (9.39), relates many details about the cult of Trophonius. Whoever desired to consult the oracle would live in a designated house for a period of days, bathing in the River Herkryna (also &quot;Erkina&quot;), named after his daughter who was a childhood friend of Persephone&#x27;s, and living on sacrificial meat. He would then sacrifice, by day, to a series of gods, including Cronus, Apollo, Zeus the king, Hera the Charioteer, and Demeter-Europa. At night, he would cast a ram into a pit sacred to Agamedes, drink from two rivers called Lethe and Mnemosyne, and then descend into a cave. Here, most consultees were frightened out of their wits, and forgot the experience entirely upon coming up.

Afterward, the consultee would be seated upon a chair of Mnemosyne, where the priests of the shrine would record his ravings and compose an oracle out of them.

==In the classical tradition==
&quot;To descend into the cave of Trophonios&quot; became a proverbial way of saying &quot;to suffer a great fright&quot;. This saying is alluded to in Aristophanes&#x27; &quot;Clouds&quot;.

Several ancient philosophers, including Heraclides Ponticus, wrote commentaries on the cult of Trophonios that are now lost. Trophonios has been of interest to classical scholars because the rivers of Lethe and Mnemosyne have close parallels with the Myth of Er at the end of Plato&#x27;s Republic, with a series of Orphic funerary inscriptions on gold leaves, and with several passages about Memory and forgetting in Hesiod&#x27;s Theogony. The Hellfire Club once constructed a &quot;Cave of Trophonius&quot; with obscene wall-paintings in which to conduct their revels. The philosopher Søren Kierkegaard references &quot;the cave of Trophonius&quot; when discussing his childhood and later philosophical revelations in his work Either/Or. The philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche makes a reference to &quot;Trophonius&quot; in the preface to his &quot;Daybreak&quot;, alluding to his labor in the &quot;underground&quot; of moral prejudices.

<text>The Portage Lakes are a group of glacial kettle lakes and reservoirs in Northeast Ohio. The name comes from an old Indian portage path that connected the Cuyahoga River flowing north to Lake Erie and the Tuscarawas River, a tributary of the Muskingum River, which flows south to the Ohio River. This proved advantageous for the Indians and early settlers as navigation from Lake Erie to the Ohio was possible with only an eight-mile portage. Portage Lakes State Park lies at one of the highest points of the state and on a major watershed divide in Ohio. Some water from the lakes reaches Lake Erie and some flows to the Ohio River.

There is an unincorporated community named Portage Lakes in Summit County, near Elevation: , in the area.

The area became an important trading post for settlers and Indians. It was a recognized landmark during the War of 1812, serving as a rendezvous point of American troops. The old Indian portage path was part of the ancient boundary between the Six Nations and the Western Indians.

The city of Akron was laid out in 1825 and was first settled by Irish laborers and others working on the Ohio and Erie Canal. Once the canal was completed, the town flourished. Several important industries brought prosperity to the area including stoneware potteries, sewer pipe manufacturing, the match industry and, most recently, the tire and rubber industry. At one time, the Blue Diamond Match Company in Akron used three million board feet (7,000 m³) of white pine lumber per year for the manufacture of its matches.

Several of the Portage Lakes were built as feeder reservoirs for the canals to maintain the required depth of . The lakes were used for this purpose until the canals were abandoned in 1913. The lakes were then used to meet the water needs of the local industries. Some portions of the remnant canals in the Akron area can still be boated.

The Ohio Department of Public Works maintained the canal lands for recreational purposes until 1949 when the Portage Lakes were transferred to the newly formed Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Parks and Recreation.

<doc id="83178" wikidata="Q2718542" url="?curid=83178" title="Alcimede (mother of Jason)">
<text>In Greek mythology, Alcimede (; Ancient Greek: Ἀλκιμέδη means &#x27;mighty cunning&#x27;) was one of the matrilineal Minyan daughters, the daughter of Clymene, Minyas&#x27; daughter.

== Family ==
Alcimede&#x27;s father was King Phylacus, eponymous founder of Phylace, and sister of Iphiclus and Clymenus.

She was the mother of Jason by Aeson, King of Iolcus. She met Aeson in the caves below Iolcus in Thessaly, a chthonic lair where the rightful king Aeson had been imprisoned by his evil half-brother Pelias. In some accounts, Alcimede was called the daughter of Autolycus; the same was said of Polymele, another possible mother of Jason.

== Mythology ==
The old story of Alcimede&#x27;s son Jason and the quest for the golden fleece is most familiar from a late version, the &quot;Argonautica&quot; of Apollonius of Rhodes.

A hint of matrilineal descent in archaic times among the Boeotian Minyans of Greece is in Apollonius&#x27; aside concerning Jason&#x27;s heritage:

:&quot;So many then were the helpers who assembled to join the son of Aeson. All the chiefs the dwellers thereabout called Minyae, for the most and the bravest avowed that they were sprung from the blood of the daughters of Minyas; thus Jason himself was the son of Alcimede, who was born of Clymene, the daughter of Minyas.&quot;

A further hint of archaic matrilineal descent is that Clymene&#x27;s consort is offered in two versions: she was usually cast as the wife of Phylacus (son of Deioneus, son of Aeolus) or in some versions, Aeson was fathered by Cephalus, otherwise the consort of Procris.

Along with Aeson, Alcimede was forced by the usurping Pelias to commit suicide. She hanged herself or else drank, along with her husband and the child Promachus, of bull&#x27;s blood and so died.

<text>In Greek mythology, Aletes () was the son of Aegisthus and Clytemnestra, the king and queen of Mycenae. He had two sisters: Erigone and Helen.

== Mythology ==
When Aletes and his siblings were young, their parents were killed by Orestes, who was their half-brother and the son of Clytemnestra and Agamemnon (this was in revenge for Clytemnestra killing Agamemnon, which she did in revenge for Agamemnon killing their daughter Iphigenia). The infant Helen was also killed or at least died young.

In most accounts, Orestes leaves Mycenae after he kills his mother and is pursued by the Furies. He wanders, is purified, and eventually marries his cousin Hermione, who lives in Sparta (he is also said to have traveled to Crimea to visit Iphigenia, who in some stories miraculously survived her father&#x27;s attempt to sacrifice her to Artemis).

Meanwhile, Aletes has come of age, and he assumes the throne at Mycenae. Orestes returns with troops, kills Aletes, and takes the throne. Orestes is said to have a son, Penthilus, with his half-sister Erigone, though stories differ as to whether this was by rape or if they married. Some say Erigone hanged herself.
