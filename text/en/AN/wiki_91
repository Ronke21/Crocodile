<text>Trichinosis, also known as trichinellosis, is a parasitic disease caused by roundworms of the &quot;Trichinella&quot; genus. During the initial infection, invasion of the intestines can result in diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Migration of larvae to muscle, which occurs about a week after being infected, can cause swelling of the face, inflammation of the whites of the eyes, fever, muscle pains, and a rash. Minor infection may be without symptoms. Complications may include inflammation of heart muscle, central nervous system involvement, and inflammation of the lungs.
Trichinosis is mainly spread when undercooked meat containing &quot;Trichinella&quot; cysts is eaten. Wild meat is more likely to contain the parasite. In North America this is most often bear, but infection can also occur from pork, boar, and dog meat. Several species of &quot;Trichinella&quot; can cause disease, with &quot;T. spiralis&quot; being the most common. After the infected meat has been eaten, the larvae are released from their cysts in the stomach. They then invade the wall of the small intestine, where they develop into adult worms. After one week, the females release new larvae that migrate to voluntarily controlled muscles, where they form cysts. The diagnosis is usually based on symptoms and confirmed by finding specific antibodies in the blood, or larvae on tissue biopsy.
The best way to prevent trichinosis is to fully cook meat. A food thermometer can verify that the temperature inside the meat is high enough. Infection is typically treated with antiparasitic medication such as albendazole or mebendazole. Rapid treatment may kill adult worms and thereby stop further worsening of symptoms. Both medications are considered safe but have been associated with side effects such as bone marrow suppression. Their use during pregnancy or in children under the age of 2 years is poorly studied but appears to be safe. Treatment with steroids is sometimes also required in severe cases. Without treatment, symptoms typically resolve within three months.
Worldwide, about 10,000 infections occur a year. At least 55 countries including the United States, China, Argentina, and Russia have had recently documented cases. While the disease occurs in the tropics, it is less common there. Rates of trichinosis in the United States have decreased from about 400 cases per year in the 1940s to 20 or fewer per year in the 2000s. The risk of death from infection is low.
==Signs and symptoms==
The great majority of trichinosis infections have either minor or no symptoms and no complications. The two main phases for the infection are enteral (affecting the intestines) and parenteral (outside the intestines). The symptoms vary depending on the phase, species of &quot;Trichinella&quot;, the quantity of encysted larvae ingested, age, sex, and host immunity.

===Enteral phase===
A large burden of adult worms in the intestines promotes symptoms such as nausea, heartburn, dyspepsia, and diarrhea from two to seven days after infection, while small worm burdens generally are asymptomatic. Eosinophilia presents early and increases rapidly.

===Parenteral phase===
The severity of symptoms caused by larval migration from the intestines depends on the number of larvae produced. As the larvae migrate through tissue and vessels, the body&#x27;s inflammatory response results in edema, muscle pain, fever, and weakness. A classic sign of trichinosis is periorbital edema, swelling around the eyes, which may be caused by vasculitis. Splinter hemorrhage in the nails is also a common symptom.

They may very rarely cause enough damage to produce serious neurological deficits (such as ataxia or respiratory paralysis) from worms entering the central nervous system (CNS), which is compromised by trichinosis in 10–24% of reported cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, a very rare form of stroke (three or four cases per million annual incidence in adults). Trichinosis can be fatal depending on the severity of the infection; death can occur 4–6 weeks after the infection, and is usually caused by myocarditis, encephalitis, or pneumonia.

==Cause==

The classical agent is &quot;T. spiralis&quot; (found worldwide in many carnivorous and omnivorous animals, both domestic and sylvatic (wild), but seven primarily sylvatic species of &quot;Trichinella&quot; also are now recognized:

===Species and characteristics===
* &quot;T. spiralis&quot; is most adapted to swine, most pathogenic in humans, and is cosmopolitan in distribution.
* &quot;T. britovi&quot; is the second-most common species to infect humans; it is distributed throughout Europe, Asia, and northern and western Africa, usually in wild carnivores, crocodiles, birds, wild boar, and domesticated pigs.
* &quot;T. murrelli&quot; also infects humans, especially from black bear meat; it is distributed among wild carnivores in North America.
* &quot;T. nativa&quot;, which has a high resistance to freezing, is found in the Arctic and subarctic regions; reservoir hosts include polar bears, Arctic foxes, walruses, and other wild game.
* &quot;T. nelsoni&quot;, found in East African predators and scavengers, has been documented to cause a few human cases.
* &quot;T. papuae&quot; infects both mammals and reptiles, including crocodiles, humans, and wild and domestic pigs; this species, found in Papua New Guinea and Thailand, is also nonencapsulated.
* &quot;T. pseudospiralis&quot; infects birds and mammals, and has demonstrated infection in humans; it is a nonencapsulated species.
* &quot;T. zimbabwensis&quot; can infect mammals, and possibly humans; this nonencapsulated species was detected in crocodiles in Africa.

===Taxonomy===
* Kingdom: Animalia
* Phylum: Nematoda
* Class: Adenophorea
* Order: Trichurida
* Family: Trichinellidae
* Genus: &quot;Trichinella&quot;

===Lifecycle===
The typical lifecycle for &quot;T. spiralis&quot; involves humans, pigs, and rodents. A pig becomes infected when it eats infectious cysts in raw meat, often porcine carrion or a rat (sylvatic cycle). A human becomes infected by consuming raw or undercooked infected pork (domestic cycle). In the stomach, the cysts from infected undercooked meat are acted on by pepsin and hydrochloric acid, which help release the larvae from the cysts into the stomach. The larvae then migrate to the small intestine, and burrow into the intestinal mucosa, where they molt four times before becoming adults.

Thirty to 34 hours after the cysts were originally ingested, the adults mate, and within five days produce larvae. Adult worms can only reproduce for a limited time because the immune system eventually expels them from the small intestine. The larvae then use their piercing mouthpart, called the &quot;stylet&quot;, to pass through the intestinal mucosa and enter the lymphatic vessels, and then enter the bloodstream.

The larvae travel by capillaries to various organs, such as the retina, myocardium, or lymph nodes; however, only larvae that migrate to skeletal muscle cells survive and encyst. The larval host cell becomes a nurse cell, in which the larva will be encapsulated, potentially for the life of the host, waiting for the host to be eaten. The development of a capillary network around the nurse cell completes encystation of the larva. Trichinosis is not soil-transmitted, as the parasite does not lay eggs, nor can it survive long outside a host.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of trichinosis is confirmed by a combination of exposure history, clinical diagnosis, and laboratory testing.

===Exposure history===
An epidemiological investigation can be done to determine a patient&#x27;s exposure to raw infected meat. Often, an infection arises from home preparation of contaminated meat, in which case microscopy of the meat may be used to determine the infection. Exposure determination does not have to be directly from a laboratory-confirmed infected animal. Indirect exposure criteria include the consumption of products from a laboratory-confirmed infected animal or sharing of a common exposure with a laboratory-confirmed infected human.

===Clinical diagnosis===
Clinical presentation of the common trichinosis symptoms may also suggest infection. These symptoms include eye puffiness, splinter hemorrhage, nonspecific gastroenteritis, and muscle pain. The case definition for trichinosis at the European Center for Disease Control states, &quot;at least three of the following six: fever, muscle soreness and pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, facial edema, eosinophilia, and subconjunctival, subungual, and retinal hemorrhages.&quot;

===Laboratory testing===
Blood tests and microscopy can be used to aid in the diagnosis of trichinosis. Blood tests include a complete blood count for eosinophilia, creatine phosphokinase activity, and various immunoassays such as ELISA for larval antigens.

In some cases, muscle biopsies are performed, where &quot;0.2 to 0.5 grams of human or animal skeletal muscle tissue is collected and examined for Trichinella larvae via artificial digestion or histological analysis.&quot;

==Prevention==

===Legislation===
Laws and rules for food producers may improve food safety for consumers, such as the rules established by the European Commission for inspections, rodent control, and improved hygiene. A similar protocol exists in the United States, in the USDA guidelines for farms and slaughterhouse responsibilities in inspecting pork.

===Education and training===
Public education about the dangers of consuming raw and undercooked meat, especially pork, may reduce infection rates. Hunters are also an at-risk population due to their contact and consumption of wild game, including bears. As such, many states, such as New York, require the completion of a course in such matters before a hunting license can be obtained.

===Meat testing===
Testing methods are available for both individual carcasses and monitoring of the herds. Artificial digestion method is usually used for the testing of individual carcasses, while the testing for specific antibodies is usually used for herd monitoring.

===Food preparation===
Larvae may be killed by the heating or irradiation of raw meat. Freezing is normally only effective for &quot;T. spiralis&quot;, since other species, such as &quot;T. nativa&quot;, are freeze-resistant and can survive long-term freezing.
* All meat (including pork) can be safely prepared by cooking to an internal temperature of or higher for 15 seconds or more.
* Wild game: Wild game meat must be cooked thoroughly (see meat preparation above). Freezing wild game does not kill all trichinosis larval worms, because the worm species that typically infests wild game can resist freezing.
* Pork: Freezing cuts of pork less than 6 inches thick for 20 days at 5 °F (−15 °C) or three days at −4 °F (−20 °C) kills &quot;T. spiralis&quot; larval worms; but this will not kill other trichinosis larval worm species, such as &quot;T. nativa&quot;, if they have infested the pork food supply (which is unlikely, due to geography).

Pork can be safely cooked to a slightly lower temperature, provided that the internal meat temperature is at least as hot for at least as long as listed in the USDA table below. Nonetheless, allowing a margin of error for variation in internal temperature within a particular cut of pork, which may have bones that affect temperature uniformity, is prudent. In addition, kitchen thermometers have measurement errors that must be considered. Pork may be cooked for significantly longer and at a higher uniform internal temperature than listed below to be safe.

Unsafe and unreliable methods of cooking meat include the use of microwave ovens, curing, drying, and smoking, as these methods are difficult to standardize and control.

===Pig farming===
Incidence of infection can be reduced by:
* Keeping pigs in clean pens, with floors that can be washed (such as concrete)
* Not allowing hogs to eat carcasses of other animals, including rats, which may be infected with &quot;Trichinella&quot;
* Cleaning meat grinders thoroughly when preparing ground meats
* Control and destruction of meat containing trichinae, e.g., removal and proper disposal of porcine diaphragms before public sale of meat

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention makes the following recommendation: &quot;Curing (salting), drying, smoking, or microwaving meat does not consistently kill infective worms.&quot;
However, under controlled commercial food processing conditions, some of these methods are considered effective by the USDA.

The USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is responsible for the regulations concerning the importation of swine from foreign countries. The Foreign Origin Meat and Meat Products, Swine section covers swine meat (cooked, cured, dried, and fresh). APHIS developed the National Trichinae Certification Program; this is a voluntary &quot;preharvest&quot; program for U.S. swine producers &quot;that will provide documentation of swine management practices&quot; to reduce the incidence of &quot;Trichinella&quot; in swine. The CDC reports 0.013% of U.S. swine are infected with &quot;Trichinella&quot;.

==Treatment==
As with most diseases, early treatment is better and decreases the risk of developing the disease. If larvae do encyst in skeletal muscle cells, they can remain infectious for months to years.

===Primary treatment===
Early administration of anthelmintics, such as mebendazole or albendazole, decreases the likelihood of larval encystation, particularly if given within three days of infection. However, most cases are diagnosed after this time. In humans, mebendazole (200–400 mg three times a day for three days) or albendazole (400 mg twice a day for 8–14 days) is given to treat trichinosis. These drugs prevent newly hatched larvae from developing, but should not be given to pregnant women or children under two years of age.

Medical references from the 1940s described no specific treatment for trichinosis at the time, but intravenous injection of calcium salts was found to be useful in managing symptoms related to severe toxemia from the infection.

===Secondary treatment===
After infection, steroids, such as prednisone, may be used to relieve muscle pain associated with larval migration.

===Vaccine research===
Researchers trying to develop a vaccine for &quot;Trichinella&quot; have tried using either &quot;larval extracts, excretory-secretory antigen, DNA, or recombinant antigen protein.&quot; Currently, no marketable vaccine is available for trichinosis, but experimental mouse studies have suggested possibilities.
* In one study, microwaved &quot;Trichinella&quot; larvae were used to immunize mice (orally or intraperitoneally), which were subsequently infected. Depending on the dosage and frequency of immunization, results ranged from a decreased larval count to complete protection from trichinosis.
* Another study used extracts and excretory-secretory products from first-stage larvae to produce an oral vaccine. To prevent gastric acids from dissolving the antigens before reaching the small intestine, scientists encapsulated the antigens in microcapsules. This vaccine significantly increased CD4+ cell levels, and increased antigen-specific serum IgGq and IgA, resulting in a statistically significant reduction in the average number of adult worms in the small intestines of mice. The significance of this approach is that, if the white blood cells in the small intestine have been exposed to &quot;Trichinella&quot; antigens (through vaccination) when an individual does get infected, the immune system will respond to expel the worms from the small intestine fast enough to prevent the female worms from releasing their larvae.
* A DNA vaccine tested on mice &quot;induced a muscle larva burden reduction in BALB/c mice by 29% in response to &quot;T. spiralis&quot; infection&quot;.

==Epidemiology==

About 11 million humans are infected with &quot;Trichinella&quot;; &quot;T. spiralis&quot; is the species responsible for most of these infections. Infection was once very common, but this disease is now rare in the developed world, but two known outbreaks occurred in 2015. In the first outbreak, around 40 people were infected in Liguria, Italy, during a New Year&#x27;s Eve celebration. The second outbreak in France was associated with pork sausages from Corsica, which were eaten raw, affecting 14 people in total.
The incidence of trichinosis in the U.S. has decreased dramatically in the past century from an average of 400 cases per year mid-20th century down to an annual average of 20 cases per year (2008–10). The number of cases has decreased because of legislation prohibiting the feeding of raw meat garbage to hogs, increased commercial and home freezing of pork, and the public awareness of the danger of eating raw or undercooked pork products.

China reports around 10,000 cases every year and is the country with the highest number of cases. In China, between 1964 and 1998, over 20,000 people became infected with trichinosis, and more than 200 people died.

Trichinosis is common in developing countries where meat fed to pigs is raw or undercooked, but infections also arise in developed countries in Europe where raw or undercooked pork, wild boar, and horse meat may be consumed as delicacies.

In the developing world, most infections are associated with undercooked pork. For example, in Thailand, between 200 and 600 cases are reported annually around the Thai New Year. This is mostly attributable to a particular delicacy, &quot;larb&quot;, which calls for undercooked pork as part of the recipe.

In parts of Eastern Europe, the World Health Organization reports, some swine herds have trichinosis infection rates above 50%, with correspondingly large numbers of human infections.

=== United States ===
Historically, pork products were thought to have the most risk of infecting humans with &quot;T. spiralis&quot;. However, a trichinosis surveillance conducted between 1997 and 2001 showed a higher percentage of cases caused by consumption of wild game (the sylvatic transmission cycle). This is thought to be due to the Federal Swine Health Protection Act (Public Law 96-468) that was passed by Congress in 1980. Before this act, swine were fed garbage that could potentially be infected by&quot; T. spiralis&quot;. This act was put in place to prevent trichinella-contaminated food from being given to swine. Additionally, other requirements were put in place, such as rodent control, limiting commercial swine contact with wildlife, maintaining good hygiene, and removing dead pigs from pens immediately.

Between 2002 and 2007, 11 trichinosis cases were reported to the CDC each year on average in the United States, and 2008–10 averaged 20 cases per year; these were mostly the result of consuming undercooked game (sylvatic transmission) or home-reared pigs (domestic transmission).

===Religious groups===
The kashrut and halal dietary laws of Judaism and Islam prohibit eating pork. In the 19th century, when the association between trichinosis and undercooked pork was first established, this association was suggested to be the reason for the prohibition, reminiscent of the earlier opinion of medieval Jewish philosopher Maimonides that food forbidden by Jewish law was &quot;unwholesome&quot;. This theory was controversial and eventually fell out of favor.

===Reemergence===
The disappearance of the pathogen from domestic pigs has led to a relaxation of legislation and control efforts by veterinary public health systems. Trichinosis has lately been thought of as a re-emerging zoonosis, supplemented by the increased distribution of meat products, political changes, a changing climate, and increasing sylvatic transmission.

Major sociopolitical changes can produce conditions that favor the resurgence of &quot;Trichinella&quot; infections in swine and, consequently, in humans. For instance, &quot;the overthrow of the social and political structures in the 1990s&quot; in Romania led to an increase in the incidence rate of trichinosis.

==History==
As early as 1835, trichinosis was known to have been caused by a parasite, but the mechanism of infection was unclear at the time. A decade later, American scientist Joseph Leidy pinpointed undercooked meat as the primary vector for the parasite, and two decades afterward, this hypothesis was fully accepted by the scientific community.

===Parasite===
The circumstances surrounding the first observation and identification of &quot;T. spiralis&quot; are controversial, due to a lack of records. In 1835, James Paget, a first-year medical student, first observed the larval form of &quot;T. spiralis&quot;, while witnessing an autopsy at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital in London. Paget took a special interest in the presentation of muscle with white flecks, described as a &quot;sandy diaphragm&quot;. Although Paget is most likely the first person to have noticed and recorded these findings, the parasite was named and published in a report by his professor, Richard Owen, who is now credited for the discovery of the &quot;T. spiralis&quot; larval form.

===Lifecycle===
A series of experiments conducted between 1850 and 1870 by the German researchers Rudolf Virchow, Rudolf Leuckart, and Friedrich Albert von Zenker, which involved feeding infected meat to a dog and performing the subsequent necropsy, led to the discovery of the lifecycle of &quot;Trichinella&quot;. Through these experiments, Virchow was able to describe the development and infectivity of &quot;T. spiralis&quot;.

==Research==
The International Commission on Trichinellosis (ICT) was formed in Budapest in 1958. Its mission is to exchange information on the epidemiology, biology, pathophysiology, immunology, and clinical aspects of trichinosis in humans and animals. Prevention is a primary goal. Since the creation of the ICT, its members (more than 110 from 46 countries) have regularly gathered and worked together during meetings held every four years: the International Conference on Trichinellosis.

<text>Ettore Arco Isidoro Bugatti (15 September 1881 – 21 August 1947) was an Italian (naturalized French) automobile designer and manufacturer. He received French citizenship in 1946. He is remembered as the founder and proprietor of the automobile manufacturing company Automobiles E. Bugatti, which he founded in 1909 in the then German town of Molsheim in the Alsace region of what is now France. Bugatti died in Paris, and is buried in Dorlisheim, France.

==Family origin and early life==
Bugatti was born into an artistic family in Milan, Italy. He was the elder son of Carlo Bugatti (1856–1940), an important Italian Art Nouveau furniture and jewellery designer, and his wife, Teresa Lorioli (1862–1935). His younger brother, Rembrandt (1884–1916), was a renowned animal sculptor. His aunt, Luigia Bugatti, was the wife of the painter Giovanni Segantini. His paternal grandfather, Giovanni Luigi Bugatti, was an architect and sculptor.

Bugatti&#x27;s father intended that he follow a conventional technical apprenticeship with one of the Milanese tri-/quadricycle manufacturers, but the boy quickly demonstrated a deep instinctive understanding of the wide range of aspects of motor-vehicle construction, and with Prinetti &amp; Stucchi constructed his &quot;Bugatti Type 1&quot; in 1898.

==Early career==
With financial support from a Count Gulinelli, Bugatti developed a second prototype, the Type 2, which was a prize-winning exhibit at the Milan Trade Fair in the Spring of 1901. His design also caught the eye of Baron Adrien de Turckheim, who offered Bugatti the opportunity to come and design automobiles at his Lorraine-Dietrich car factory in Niederbronn. Frontier changes following the Franco-Prussian War had left De Dietrich with two car factories in two different countries: the Niederbronn plant, to which Bugatti now relocated was in Alsace, which had been part of Germany since 1871, reverting to French control only in 1919. In 1902 Ettore became the head of technology at De Dietrich.

From 1902 through 1904, De Dietrich built his Type 3/4 and Type 5/6/7, identified at the time with the name &quot;De Dietrich, Licence Bugatti&quot;. While working for De Dietrich Bugatti met Émile Mathis. The two became first friends and then business partners, leaving De Dietrich in 1904 in order to produce automobiles of their own, which were identified with the name &quot;Mathis-Hermes (Licence Bugatti)&quot;. This arrangement lasted till 1906 after which the partners went their separate ways, and Bugatti set up a &quot;Research centre&quot; at Illkirch-Graffenstaden, now a suburb on the south-side of Strasbourg. He produced several prototypes, collaborating closely with the Cologne based Deutz company.

In 1907, Bugatti was appointed Production Director (&quot;Directeur des fabrications&quot;) with Deutz. Here he designed the Type 8/9. While employed at Deutz, Bugatti built the Type 10 in the basement of his home. In 1913, Bugatti designed a small car for Peugeot, the Type 19 &quot;Bébé&quot;.

==Automobiles E. Bugatti==

Despite being born in Italy, Bugatti established his automobile company, Automobiles E. Bugatti, in 1909 in the then German town of Molsheim in the Alsace region of what is now France. The maker was known for some of the fastest, most luxurious, and technologically advanced road cars of its day. Exceptional engineering led to success in early Grand Prix motor racing, with a Bugatti being driven to victory in the first Monaco Grand Prix.

While displaced from his home in Alsace by World War I, Bugatti designed aeroplane engines, notably the somewhat baroque 16-cylinder U-16, which was never built in any large number and was installed in only a very few aircraft. Between the wars Bugatti designed a successful motorized railcar dubbed the Autorail Bugatti, and won a government contract to construct an airplane, the Model 100. It was designed by Louis de Monge using two type 50B Bugatti engines but never flew due to the outbreak of World War II. Surgical instruments, designed by Bugatti for a friend who was a professor at a nearby hospital, are still in use to this day.

Bugatti&#x27;s son, Jean, was killed on 11 August 1939 at the age of 30 while testing a Bugatti Type 57 tank-bodied race car near the Molsheim factory. After that, the company&#x27;s fortunes began to decline. World War II ruined the factory in Molsheim, and the company lost control of the property. During the war, Bugatti planned a new factory at Levallois in Paris and designed a series of new cars.

Bugatti&#x27;s concept of customer relations was somewhat eccentric. To a Bugatti owner who complained that his car was difficult to start on cold mornings, he is said to have retorted, &quot;Sir! If you can afford a Type 35, you can surely afford a heated garage!&quot; Another famous line he told to a customer complaining about the brakes in one model was, &quot;I make my cars to go, not stop!&quot; He was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 2000.

==Personal life==
In 1907 Bugatti married Barbara Maria Giuseppina Mascherpa. They had two daughters, L&#x27;Ébé in 1903 and Lidia in 1907, and two sons, Jean in 1909, and Roland in 1922. His wife Barbara died in 1944, and Bugatti remarried in 1946, to Geneviève Marguerite Delcuze. They had a daughter, Thérèse in 1942 and a son, Michel in 1945.

Bugatti died at the American hospital in the inner-Paris suburb of Neuilly, in the late summer of 1947. Afflicted by a paralysis of his mental faculties, he had for several months been confined to the Paris apartment in the rue Boissière, which he had owned since 1916. He was almost certainly unaware of the court decision whereby his property in Alsace, which had been seized by the state in the feverish post-liberation frenzy of anger and retribution which his Italian origins had invited, was restored to him on 20 June 1947; Bugatti died just over two months later, on 21 August without having recovered consciousness. Bugatti was buried in the Bugatti family plot at the municipal cemetery in Dorlisheim, near Molsheim, in the Bas-Rhin department of France. Molsheim&#x27;s Musée de la Chartreuse houses a section dedicated to his life, work, and legacy.

<doc id="83949" wikidata="Q39938" url="?curid=83949" title="Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator">
<text>Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator (, &quot;Ptolemaĩos&quot;; c. 62 BC – 13 January 47 BC) was Pharaoh of Egypt from 51 to 47 BC, and one of the last members of the Ptolemaic dynasty (305–30 BC). He was the son of Ptolemy XII and the brother of and co-ruler with Cleopatra VII. Cleopatra&#x27;s exit from Egypt caused a civil war to break out between the pharaohs. Ptolemy later ruled jointly with his other sister, Arsinoe IV.

==Biography==
=== Co-ruler of Egypt ===


Son of the Egyptian Pharaoh Ptolemy XII (r. 80–58 BC and 55–51 BC), Ptolemy XIII succeeded his father as pharaoh of the Ptolemaic Kingdom in the spring of 51 BC at the age of 11. His father had stipulated that Ptolemy XIII would be married to his older sister Cleopatra (r. 51–30 BC), with the couple ruling as co-rulers. In October 50 BC, Ptolemy XIII was promoted to senior ruler along with her, although the eunuch Pothinus acted as regent for him.

In the spring of 48 BC, Ptolemy XIII and Pothinus attempted to depose Cleopatra due to her increasing status as queen. Her face appeared on minted coins, for example, while Ptolemy XIII&#x27;s name was omitted on official documents. Ptolemy intended to become main ruler, with Pothinus acting as the power behind the throne.

===Civil war===
Ptolemy XIII and Pothinus managed to force Cleopatra to flee to Syria, but she soon organized her own army and a civil war began in Egypt. Soon their other sister started to claim the throne as Arsinoe IV of Egypt (r. 48–47 BC), further complicating the situation.

At this point, defeated Roman general Pompey the Great came to Egypt seeking refuge from his pursuing rival Julius Caesar. Initially, Ptolemy XIII pretended to have accepted his request, but on 29 September 48 BC, he had the general murdered by Achillas and Lucius Septimius in hopes of winning favor with Caesar when the victorious general arrived.

When Caesar arrived he was presented with the head of his deceased rival and former ally, but reportedly, instead of being pleased, Caesar reacted with disgust and ordered that Pompey&#x27;s body be located and given a proper Roman funeral. Cleopatra VII proved more successful in winning Caesar&#x27;s favor and became his lover. Caesar arranged the execution of Pothinus and the official return to the throne of Cleopatra VII, though she had never officially abdicated her marriage to Ptolemy XIII.

Still determined to depose Cleopatra VII, Ptolemy XIII allied himself with Arsinoe IV. Jointly, they organized the factions of the army loyal to them against those loyal to Cleopatra VII and the relatively small part of his army that had accompanied Caesar to Egypt. The battle between the warring factions occurred in mid-December 48 BC inside Alexandria itself (Siege of Alexandria (47 BC)), which suffered serious damage. Around this time, the burning of the Library of Alexandria occurred.

Upon the arrival of Roman reinforcements, the Battle of the Nile (47 BC) ensued and resulted in a victory for Caesar and Cleopatra, forcing Ptolemy XIII to flee the city. He reportedly drowned on 13 January 47 BC while attempting to cross the Nile river. Whether he was attempting to flee or was seeking negotiations remains uncertain from sources of the time. Cleopatra VII remained the unchallenged ruler of Egypt, although she named their younger brother Ptolemy XIV of Egypt (r. 47–44 BC) her new co-ruler.

==Cultural depictions==
Ptolemy appears in George Frideric Handel&#x27;s 1724 opera &quot;Giulio Cesare in Egitto&quot; (&quot;Julius Caesar in Egypt&quot;) and George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s play &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot;, and was played by Richard O&#x27;Sullivan in the 1963 motion picture &quot;Cleopatra&quot;. Ptolemy and his fight with Caesar and Cleopatra for control of Egypt also feature in the HBO TV series &quot;Rome&quot; episode &quot;Caesarion&quot;.

Ptolemy&#x27;s civil war with Cleopatra figures prominently in the 2017 historical video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Origins&quot;, in which he is presented as a weak puppet ruler to the &quot;Order of Ancients&quot; who drove him to depose his sister. At the end of the war, main character Aya draws an arrow to kill him, but holds back as his boat is attacked by crocodiles, causing him to fall into the river and drown.

<text>The is a series of supercomputers deployed at Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology Yokohama Institute of Earth Sciences.

== Earth Simulator (first generation) ==

The first generation of Earth Simulator, developed by the Japanese government&#x27;s initiative &quot;Earth Simulator Project&quot;, was a highly parallel vector supercomputer system for running global climate models to evaluate the effects of global warming and problems in solid earth geophysics. The system was developed for Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute, and Japan Marine Science and Technology Center (JAMSTEC) in 1997. Construction started in October 1999, and the site officially opened on 11 March 2002. The project cost 60 billion yen.

Built by NEC, ES was based on their SX-6 architecture. It consisted of 640 nodes with eight vector processors and 16 gigabytes of computer memory at each node, for a total of 5120 processors and 10 terabytes of memory. Two nodes were installed per 1 metre × 1.4 metre × 2 metre cabinet. Each cabinet consumed 20 kW of power. The system had 700 terabytes of disk storage (450 for the system and 250 for the users) and 1.6 petabytes of mass storage in tape drives. It was able to run holistic simulations of global climate in both the atmosphere and the oceans down to a resolution of 10 km. Its performance on the LINPACK benchmark was 35.86 TFLOPS, which was almost five times faster than the previous fastest supercomputer, ASCI White.

ES was the fastest supercomputer in the world from 2002 to 2004. Its capacity was surpassed by IBM&#x27;s Blue Gene/L prototype on 29 September 2004.

== Earth Simulator (second generation) ==
ES was replaced by the Earth Simulator 2 (ES2) in March 2009. ES2 is an NEC SX-9/E system, and has a quarter as many nodes each of 12.8 times the performance (3.2× clock speed, four times the processing resource per node), for a peak performance of 131 TFLOPS. With a delivered LINPACK performance of 122.4 TFLOPS, ES2 was the most efficient supercomputer in the world at that point. In November 2010, NEC announced that ES2 topped the Global FFT, one of the measures of the HPC Challenge Awards, with the performance number of 11.876 TFLOPS.

== Earth Simulator (third generation) ==
ES2 was replaced by the Earth Simulator 3 (ES3) in March 2015. ES3 is a NEC SX-ACE system with 5120 nodes, and a performance of 1.3 PFLOPS.

ES3, from 2017 to 2018, ran alongside Gyoukou, a supercomputer with immersion cooling that can achieve up to 19 PFLOPS.


== Earth Simulator (fourth generation) ==
The Earth Simulator 4 (ES4) uses AMD EPYC processors, with acceleration by the NEC SX-Aurora TSUBASA Vector Engine and NVIDIA Ampere A100 GPUs.

<doc id="83986" wikidata="Q1195557" url="?curid=83986" title="State Sponsors of Terrorism (U.S. list)">
<text>&quot;State Sponsors of Terrorism&quot; is a designation applied to countries that are alleged to have &quot;repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism&quot; per the United States Department of State. Inclusion on the list enables the United States government to impose four main types of unilateral sanctions: a restriction of foreign aid, a ban on weapons sales, heightened control over the export of dual-use equipment, and other miscellaneous economic sanctions. The State Department is required to maintain the list under section 1754(c) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, section 40 of the Arms Export Control Act, and section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act.

In 1979, the first such list was published by the State Department, designating Iraq, Libya, South Yemen, and Syria as terrorist states. , the list consists of Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria. The countries that were once on the list but have since been removed are: Iraq, Libya, South Yemen (dissolved in 1990), and Sudan. A resolution concerning the addition of Russia to the list was introduced to the senate following Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

==Timeline==
==Countries currently on the list==
===Cuba (1982–2015, 2021–present)===
Cuba was added to the list on March 1, 1982, on the basis that it has a history of supporting revolutionary movements in Spanish-speaking countries and Africa.

Havana openly advocates armed revolution as the only means for leftist forces to gain power in Latin America, and the Cubans have played an important role in facilitating the movement of men and weapons into the region. Havana provides direct support in the form of training, arms, safe havens, and advice to a wide variety of guerrilla groups. Many of these groups engage in terrorist operations.

According to the U.S. Department of State, Cuba &quot;encouraged terrorism in the hope of provoking indiscriminate violence and repression, in order to weaken government legitimacy and attract new converts to armed struggle.&quot; In 1992, after the Soviet collapse, Fidel Castro stressed that his country&#x27;s support for insurgents abroad was a thing of the past.

According to Country Reports on Terrorism 2010: August 18, 2011:

On December 17, 2014, an agreement to restore relations with Cuba was reached (Cuban thaw); President Barack Obama instructed the Secretary of State to immediately launch a review of Cuba&#x27;s inclusion on the list, and provide a report to the President within six months regarding Cuba&#x27;s alleged support for international terrorism. President Barack Obama announced on April 14, 2015, that Cuba was being removed from the list. Cuba would not come off the list until after a 45-day review period, during which the U.S. Congress could try blocking Cuba&#x27;s removal via a joint resolution. Congress did not act, and Cuba was officially removed from the list on May 29, 2015.

Cuba was readded to the list on January 12, 2021, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo citing &quot;repeatedly providing support for acts of international terrorism&quot; by harboring U.S. fugitives as well as Colombian rebel leaders. Cuba&#x27;s support for Nicolás Maduro in the presidential crisis, knowing the Maduro administration created &quot;a permissive environment for international terrorists to live and thrive within Venezuela&quot; was another reason for the redesignation. The redesignation came just eight days before Donald Trump&#x27;s first presidency ended on January 20 at noon.

On January 14, 2025, U.S. President Joe Biden notified Congress of his proposed removal of Cuba from the list of State Sponsors of Terrorism. The proposed removal was part of a Vatican-brokered deal that would see the release of 553 prisoners detained for &quot;diverse crimes,&quot; including those arrested during the 2021 Cuban anti-government protests. According to a senior official of the Biden administration, an assessment on Cuba had been completed and found that there was no information supporting Cuba&#x27;s designation. However, on January 20, 2025, succeeding President Donald Trump revoked the proposed removal of Cuba from the list. The proposed removal never took effect as it required a waiting period of 45 days, which would have been on February 28, 2025.

===Iran (1984–present)===

Iran was added to the list on January 19, 1984. According to &quot;Country Reports on Terrorism 2013&quot;:

Mike Pompeo issued an official statement as the US Secretary of State on 12 January 2021, stating, &quot;al-Qaeda has a new home base: it is the Islamic Republic of Iran.&quot;

===North Korea (1988–2008, 2017–present)===
North Korea was added in 1988, following the 1987 bombing of Korean Air Flight 858 near Myanmar and re-listed again in 2017. North Korea was initially added because it sold weapons to terrorist groups and gave asylum to Japanese Communist League-Red Army Faction members. The country is also responsible for the Rangoon bombing.

According to Country Reports on Terrorism: April 30, 2007:
Terrorology specialist Gus Martin writes in his &quot;Understanding Terrorism: Challenges, Perspectives and Issues&quot; that &quot;it is important to note that the State Department&#x27;s list includes countries that have significantly reduced their involvement in terrorism, such as North Korea and Cuba. For example, North Korea was at one time quite active in attacking South Korean interests. In November 1987, North Korean operatives apparently destroyed Korean Airlines Flight 858, which exploded in Myanmar (Burma). The North Korean government has since renounced its sponsorship of terrorism.&quot;

On April 13, 2008, Pyongyang agreed to dismantle the Yongbyon facility as part of an aid-for-disarmament deal. In response, on June 26, 2008, President George W. Bush announced that he would remove North Korea from the list. On October 11, the country was officially removed from the list for meeting all nuclear inspection requirements. The U.S State Department said it made the decision as Pyongyang had agreed to the verification of all of its nuclear programs, etc.

Despite requests from the South Korean government to put North Korea back on the list after it allegedly sank the Navy ship the ROKS &quot;Cheonan&quot; in 2010, the Obama administration stated that it would not do so because the act was conducted by only the North Korean military and was thus not an act of terror. However, following the incident, the Obama administration also stated that it would then closely monitor North Korea for signs for a return to international terrorism. U.S. State Department spokesman P.J Crowley also said that returning North Korea to the list was under continual review.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated in 2009 that she was considering renaming North Korea on the List of State Sponsors of Terrorism. As of 2016, North Korea, unlike the other countries removed and the designated state sponsor of terrorism Sudan, was still listed as not fully cooperating with the United States to fight terrorism.

In February 2017, following the alleged state-sponsored murder of Kim Jong-nam (Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un&#x27;s half-brother) using the nerve agent VX (banned under the international Chemical Weapons Convention, a convention which the North Korean government has not signed), pressure was placed on the Trump administration to revoke Bush&#x27;s lifting of sanctions. In April 2017, U.S. Congress backed a bill to reinstate North Korea as a state sponsor of terror following the 2017 Shayrat missile strike in Syria, which North Korea had condemned vehemently. In August of the same year, the nation launched a missile that flew over Hokkaido, Japan, promoting severe condemnation from other states. In September, the parents of Otto Warmbier, who had died after being imprisoned in the nation, stated that they want North Korea to be relisted for his apparent murder.
On November 20, 2017, President Trump officially announced the re-listing of North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism.

===Syria (1979–present)===

Ba&#x27;athist Syria was added to the list on December 29, 1979. It is the only country from the original 1979 list to remain on the list, following Libya&#x27;s removal in 2006.
According to 2021 edition of Country Reports on Terrorism published by the United States:

In 2016, the US district court of Columbia declared that the financial and logistical support of the Syrian government was crucial for establishing a well-structured pathway for the fighters of al-Qaeda in Iraq in carrying out anti-American combat operations throughout the Iraqi insurgency. The court further stated that Syria &quot;became a crucial base for AQI&quot;, by hosting several associates of Al-Zarqawi and leading commanders of the insurgency, and stated that Syria&#x27;s policies &quot;led to the deaths of hundreds of Americans in Iraq&quot;. The district court also found evidence of Syrian military intelligence assisting Al-Qaeda in Iraq and giving &quot;crucial material support&quot; to AQI militants who carried out the 2005 Amman bombings.

Following the Fall of the Assad regime in December 2024, it was unclear if the United States planned to drop Syria from the list of the State Sponsors of Terrorism, although Hay&#x27;at Tahrir al-Sham, which contributed to Assad&#x27;s fall and was led by current Syrian president Ahmed al-Sharaa, had been labeled as a terrorist group in 2018.

==Countries under discussion==
===Russia===
In May 2022, Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) announced the introduction of a resolution calling on the Biden administration to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism for its war on Ukraine and conduct elsewhere under Vladimir Putin. &quot;Putin is a terrorist, and one of the most disruptive forces on the planet is Putin&#x27;s Russia,&quot; said Graham, introducing the resolution.

==Countries that have been removed==
=== Iraq (1979–1982, 1990–2004) ===
Iraq was added to the list on December 29, 1979, but was removed in February 1982 to allow US aid to Iraq while it was fighting Iran in the Iran–Iraq War. It was re-added on September 13, 1990, following its Invasion of Kuwait.

=== Libya (1979–2006) ===
Libya was added on December 29, 1979. Then under the rule of Muammar Gaddafi, it was branded a sponsor of terrorism due to the government&#x27;s support for several left-wing militant groups, such as the Provisional Irish Republican Army, the Basque Fatherland and Liberty, the Umkhonto We Sizwe, the Polisario Front, the Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party, the Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, the Palestine Liberation Organization, Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Free Aceh Movement, Free Papua Movement, Fretilin, Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front, Republic of South Maluku and the Moro National Liberation Front of the Philippines. On May 15, 2006, the United States announced that Libya would be removed from the list after a 45-day wait period. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice explained that this was due to &quot;...Libya&#x27;s continued commitment to its renunciation of terrorism&quot;.

=== South Yemen (1979–1990) ===
South Yemen was added to the list on December 29, 1979. It had been branded a sponsor of terrorism due to its support for several left-wing terrorist groups.

The country was dropped from the list in 1990 after it merged with the Yemen Arab Republic (North Yemen) on May 22, 1990, to become the new Republic of Yemen.

=== Sudan (1993–2020) ===
Sudan was added to the list on August 12, 1993. American officials alleged that Sudan harbored members of the Abu Nidal Organization, Hezbollah, and Islamic Jihad.

In October 2020, President Donald Trump announced that the United States would remove Sudan from the list following the ousting and subsequent removal of President Omar Al-Bashir, and an agreement with the new transitional government to pay $335 million in compensation to the families of victims of the 1998 United States embassy bombings.

On December 14, 2020, the United States officially removed Sudan from the list.

==Sanctions==
The sanctions which the US imposes on countries on the list are:
# A ban on arms-related exports and sales.
# Controls over exports of dual-use items, requiring 30-day Congressional notification for goods or services that could significantly enhance the terrorist-list country&#x27;s military capability or ability to support terrorism.
# Prohibitions on economic assistance.
# Imposition of miscellaneous financial and other restrictions, including:
:*Requiring the United States to oppose loans by the World Bank and other international financial institutions;
:*Lifting diplomatic immunity to allow families of terrorist victims to file civil lawsuits in U.S. courts;
:*Denying companies and individuals credits for income taxes paid to terrorist-listed countries;
:*Denial of duty-free treatment of goods exported to the United States;
:*Authority to prohibit any U.S. citizen from engaging in a financial transaction with a terrorist-list government without a Treasury Department license; and
:*Prohibition of Defense Department contracts above $100,000 with companies controlled by terrorist-list states.
:*From January 2016, the countries listed were included in a separate exclusion from the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) under the &quot;Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015&quot;. People who have been in these countries on or after March 1, 2011, or who are nationals of these countries in addition to the nationality that would otherwise entitle them to a visa waiver, are not eligible for the VWP. Instead, they are required to go through the process of obtaining a visa. However, those who traveled to such countries for diplomatic, military, humanitarian, reporting or legitimate business purposes may have this ineligibility waived by the Secretary of Homeland Security.
:*Under the first Trump administration, citizens of these countries (Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Syria) faced partial entry restrictions to the United States under Presidential Proclamation 9645 of the Executive Order 13780. The order was in force from 2017 until its revocation in 2021.
::*Entry of all North Korean and Syrian nationals into the United States as immigrant and non-immigrant was suspended.
::*Entry of all Iranian nationals into the United States as immigrant and non-immigrant was suspended unless they had valid student visas (F, M-1, and M-2 visas) or exchange visitor visas (J-1 and J-2 visas), but might be subject to enhanced screening.
::*Travel restrictions imposed by the United States on citizens of Sudan were removed under Presidential Proclamation 9645.
::*Unlike the previous executive order, these restrictions were conditional and could be lifted if those countries met the required security standards set up by the United States.

==Criticism==
Michael F. Oppenheimer, professor at New York University&#x27;s Center for Global Affairs, considers the State Sponsors of Terrorism list as a &quot;negotiating tool&quot; that, in the case of Iran, serves as a &quot;bargaining chip,&quot; where the United States would &quot;take them off as part of process of alleviating sanctions against Iran in exchange for what we&#x27;re asking for in the nuclear agenda.&quot; Oppenheimer continues:
Countries that wind up on that list are countries we don&#x27;t like [...] Other countries and outside powers support terrorism, and objectively speaking are terrorists, and the ones we don&#x27;t like are on the list, and the ones we&#x27;re allied with are not on the list. It&#x27;s all about double standards.

Linguist and political activist Noam Chomsky wrote that Iraq was removed from the list in 1982 &quot;in order to permit the US to join the UK and others in providing badly needed aid for Saddam Hussein, continuing without concern after he carried out his most horrifying crimes.&quot; About Syria being in the list, Chomsky writes:
Chomsky continued:
Returning to Iraq, when Saddam was removed from the list of states supporting terrorism, Cuba was added to replace it, perhaps in recognition of the sharp escalation in international terrorist attacks against Cuba in the late 1970s, including the bombing of a Cubana airliner killing 73 people and many other atrocities. These were mostly planned and implemented in the US [...] Washington was officially condemning the terrorist acts while harbouring and protecting the terrorist cells on US soil in violation of US law.

David Gewirtz, executive director of the US Strategic Perspective Initiative and a cyber-warfare adviser for the International Association of Counterterrorism &amp; Security Professionals writes: 

==Terrorist safe havens==
The U.S. Country Reports on Terrorism also describes &quot;Terrorist safe havens&quot; which &quot;described in this report include ungoverned, under-governed, or ill-governed physical areas where terrorists are able to organize, plan, raise funds, communicate, recruit, train, transit, and operate in relative security because of inadequate governance capacity, political will, or both&quot;. In the U.S. Annual report published in July 2017, which was mandated by the Congress titled &quot;Country Report on Terrorism&quot;, the State Department listed numerous regions as &quot;Terrorist safe havens.&quot;

=== Somalia, Libya and Mali ===
In Africa, Somalia was listed as a country where Al-Shabaab finds safe haven, particularly in the Jubba River valley. The poorly-governed regions in the Trans-Sahara, in particular in Mali, is where terrorist groups have used territory to &quot;organize, plan, raise funds, communicate, recruit, train, and operate in relative security.&quot; In Libya, porous borders and poorly cohesive security forces along with a large area of ungoverned territory have allowed for a &quot;permissive environment&quot; in which several terrorist groups can operate, such as Ansar al-Sharia, Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Al-Mourabitoun, and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

=== Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen ===
In the Middle East, parts of the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt, operations against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Sinai Province have made the northern part of the peninsula off-limits to tourists. In southern Lebanon, the government was reported to not be in control of &quot;all regions&quot; of the country, nor its borders with Israel and Syria, creating a space for Hezbollah to operate with &quot;relative impunity,&quot; and the government has been noted to have made no attempt to disarm the group. Other groups such as the Al-Nusra Front and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant have been noted to operate in mountainous regions of the country. In Yemen, numerous groups such as Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, ISIL operate due to a &quot;political and security vacuum,&quot; and have been able to exploit the country&#x27;s sectarian divide to gain support among Sunnis.

=== Philippines ===
In South-East Asia, several islands in the Sulawesi Sea and Sulu Archipelago, difficult to govern lands have provided terrorist groups the ability to operate under the cover of &quot;traditional smuggling and piracy groups.&quot; Abu Sayyaf, Jemaah Islamiyah, and the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters also operate in difficult to govern regions on the Mindanao island in the Philippines.

=== Afghanistan and Pakistan ===
In South Asia, the border regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan are labeled &quot;ungoverned areas&quot; which terrorists have been able to exploit in order to conduct terrorist activities in both countries. The State Department stated that terror groups like the LeT and JeM continue to operate, train, organize, and fundraise openly inside Pakistan in 2016. Though the LeT is officially banned in Pakistan, its Jama&#x27;at-ud-Da&#x27;wah and Falah-e-Insaniat wings are not, although the JuD is &quot;under observation&quot; in accordance with the country&#x27;s Schedule Two of the Anti-Terrorism Act.

=== Colombia and Venezuela ===
In the Western hemisphere, Colombia&#x27;s dense rainforests and weak government presence along its international borders were noted to have allowed safe havens for terrorist groups such as the FARC to operate. &quot;Credible reports&quot; have stated that neighboring Venezuela has maintained a &quot;permissive environment&quot; for the activities of &quot;known terrorist groups.&quot; In particular, they blame Nicolás Maduro and associates of using &quot;criminal activities&quot; to foster a &quot;permissive environment&quot; for known terrorist groups, including FARC, Hezbollah, and the National Liberation Army.

<text>Camp is an aesthetic and sensibility that regards something as appealing or amusing because of its heightened level of artifice, affectation and exaggeration, especially when there is also a playful or ironic element. &quot;Camp&quot; is historically associated with LGBTQ culture and especially gay men. Camp aesthetics disrupt modernist understandings of high art by inverting traditional aesthetic judgements of beauty, value, and taste, and inviting a different kind of aesthetic engagement.

Camp art is distinct from but often confused with kitsch&quot;.&quot; The American writer Susan Sontag emphasized its key elements as embracing frivolity, excess and artifice.&quot;&quot; Art historian David Carrier notes that, despite these qualities, it is also subversive and political. &quot;Camp&quot; may be sophisticated, but subjects deemed &quot;camp&quot; may also be perceived as being dated, offensive or in bad taste. &quot;Camp&quot; may also be divided into &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; &quot;camp&quot; (i.e., camp arising from serious versus unserious matters), or alternatively into &quot;naive&quot; and &quot;deliberate camp&quot; (i.e., accidental versus intentional camp). While author and academic Moe Meyer defines &quot;camp&quot; as a form of &quot;queer parody&quot;, journalist Jack Babuscio argues it is a specific &quot;gay sensibility&quot; which has often been &quot;misused to signify the trivial, superficial and &#x27;queer&#x27;&quot;.

&quot;Camp&quot;, as a particular style or set of mannerisms, may serve as a marker of identity, such as in &quot;camp talk&quot;, which expresses a gay male identity. This &quot;camp style&quot; is associated with incongruity or juxtaposition, theatricality, and humour, and has appeared in film, cabaret, and pantomime. Both high and low forms of culture may be &quot;camp&quot;, but where high art incorporates beauty and value, &quot;camp&quot; often strives to be lively, audacious and dynamic. &quot;Camp&quot; can also be tragic, sentimental and ironic, finding beauty or black comedy even in suffering. The humour of &quot;camp&quot;, as well as its frivolity, may serve as a coping mechanism to deal with intolerance and marginalization in society.

== Origins and development ==
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; notes that the word &quot;camp&quot; was used as a verb since at least the 1500s. Writer Bruce Rodgers also traces the term &quot;camp&quot; to the 16th century, specifically to British theatre, where it referred to men dressed as women (drag). &quot;Camp&quot; may have derived from the gay slang Polari, which borrowed the term from the Italian &quot;campare,&quot; or from the French term &quot;se camper&quot;, meaning &quot;to pose in an exaggerated fashion&quot;. A similar sense is also found in French theatre in Molière&#x27;s 1671 play &quot;Les Fourberies de Scapin&quot;.

Writer Susan Sontag and linguist Paul Baker place the &quot;soundest starting point&quot; for the modern sense of &quot;camp&quot;, meaning &quot;flamboyant&quot;, as the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Writer Anthony Burgess theorized it may have emerged from the primary sense of the word&quot;,&quot; as in a military encampment, where gay men would subtly advertize their sexuality in all-male company through a particular style and affectation.

By 1870, British crossdresser Frederick Park referred to his &quot;campish undertakings&quot; in a letter produced in evidence at his examination before a magistrate at Bow Street, London, on suspicion of illegal homosexual acts; the letter does not make clear what these were. In 1874, the &quot;Manchester Courier&quot; printed the description of a ticket for a Salford drag ball, called the &quot;Queen of Camp&quot; ball. According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the first definitive use of &quot;camp&quot; as an adjective in print occurred in the writing of J. R. Ware in 1909. In the UK&#x27;s pre-liberation gay culture, the term was used as a general description of the aesthetic choices and behavior of working-class gay men. The term &quot;camp&quot; is still sometimes used in the UK to describe a gay man who is perceived as outwardly garish or eccentric, such as Matt Lucas&#x27; character Daffyd Thomas in the English comedy skit show &quot;Little Britain&quot;.

From the mid-1940s, numerous representations of &quot;camp speech&quot; or &quot;camp&quot; &quot;talk&quot;, as used by gay men, began to appear in print in America, France and the United Kingdom. By the mid-1970s, camp was defined by the college edition of &quot;Webster&#x27;s New World Dictionary&quot; as &quot;banality, mediocrity, artifice, [and] ostentation ... so extreme as to amuse or have a perversely sophisticated appeal&quot;.In America, the concept of camp was also described by Christopher Isherwood in 1954 in his novel &quot;The World in the Evening&quot;, and later by Susan Sontag in her 1964 essay &#x27;Notes on &quot;Camp&quot;&#x27;. Two key components of the &quot;radical spectacle of camp&quot; were originally feminine performances: swish and drag. With swish&#x27;s extensive use of superlatives and drag&#x27;s exaggerated female impersonation, camp occasionally became extended to all things &quot;over the top&quot;, including women posing as female impersonators (faux queens) such as Carmen Miranda, while also retaining its meaning as &quot;queer parody&quot;.

In her study of drag, cultural anthropologist Esther Newton argued that &quot;camp&quot; has three major features: incongruity, theatricality, and humour. In his 1984, writer George Melly argued that the camp sensibility allowed almost anything to be seen as a &quot;camp&quot;, and that this was a way of projecting one&#x27;s own queer sensibility upon the world to therefore reclaim it. Conversely, he argued, the biggest threat to camp wasn&#x27;t heterosexuals (&quot;who tend to accept it, although usually at a fairly broad and superficial level&quot;), but &quot;a neo-puritanism, a received conformism&quot; emerging among gay people at the time.

The rise of postmodernism and queer theory has made &quot;camp&quot; a common perspective on aesthetics, not solely identified with gay men. Women (especially lesbians), trans people, and people of colour have described new forms of &quot;camp&quot;, such as &quot;dyke camp&quot; (including subcategories such as &quot;cubana&quot; and &quot;high-femme dyke camp&quot;) and &quot;queer of color camp&quot;.

&quot;Camp&quot; has also been a subject of psychoanalytic theory, where it has been portrayed as a form of performance or &quot;masquerade&quot;. Scholar Cynthia Morrill has argued that the conception of &quot;camp-as-masquerade&quot; ignores the specifically queer sensibility of &quot;camp&quot; by interrogating queerness through a heteronormative lens (i.e., solely in relation to the symbol of the phallus).

&quot;Camp&quot; has become prevalent in mainstream popular entertainment such as theatre, cinema, TV and music. In reaction to its popularisation, critics such as Jack Babuscio and Jeanette Cooperman have argued that &quot;camp&quot; requires the alienation of LGBTQ+ people from the mainstream to maintain its edge. Poet and scholar Chris Philpot, like Cooperman, nevertheless argues that &quot;camp&quot; can still be a viable &quot;survival strategy&quot; for marginalized queer people, so long as it evolves with them. Curator Andrew Bolton, after his show &quot;Camp: Notes on Fashion&quot; at the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art, explains that context is also important for understanding the power and relevance of camp: &quot;Camp tends to come to the fore through moments of social and political instability, when our society is deeply polarized. The 1960s is one such moment, as were the 1980s, so, too, are the times in which we&#x27;re living.&quot;

== &quot;Camp&quot; in contemporary culture ==
=== Fashion ===
Patrick Kelly&#x27;s designs have been described as camp and &quot;Radical Cheek&quot; for his ironic use of bold colours, antiquated or incongruous styles, and reclaimed racist symbols. He designed a banana dress in reference to Josephine Baker and dedicated a whole collection to her. He used mismatched buttons when creating his own take on a Chanel suit. By the time he died in 1990, he had dressed noted queer icons such as Grace Jones and Isabella Rossellini. His grave is marked with a stylized golliwog—a reclaimed symbol for his label—featuring big gold earrings and bright red lips.The 2019 Met Gala&#x27;s theme was , co-chaired by Anna Wintour, Serena Williams, Lady Gaga, Harry Styles, and Alessandro Michele. The show featured tributes to queer and camp figures, including a bronze statue of the Vatican&#x27;s Belvedere Antinous, portraits of Louis XIV and Oscar Wilde, and celebrations of Black and Latinx ball culture and the Harlem Renaissance. Dapper Dan—whose luxurious fashion has been credited with camping up the hip-hop genre—designed seven camp outfits for Gucci, worn at the gala by 21 Savage, Omari Hardwick, Regina Hall, Bevy Smith, Ashley Graham and Karlie Kloss (he wore the seventh).

Lady Gaga&#x27;s entrance took 16 minutes, as she arrived to the gala alongside an entourage of five dancers carrying umbrellas, a make up artist, and a personal photographer to snap pictures of Gaga&#x27;s poses. Gaga arrived in a hot pink Brandon Maxwell gown with a 25-foot train and went through a series of four &quot;reveals,&quot; paying homage to drag culture, debuting a new outfit each time, until reaching her final look: a bra and underwear with fishnets and platform heels. Other notable ensembles included Katy Perry wearing a gown that looked like a chandelier, designed by Moschino; and Kacey Musgraves appearing as a life-size Barbie, also by Moschino.

=== Film ===

Melodrama films have been celebrated for their unintentional camp content by gay male culture long before critics and academics first defined the genre in the 1970s. Some writers have even considered the genre to be &quot;cinema made for and by gay men.&quot; In addition to the films of Douglas Sirk (the greatest exponent of melodrama), several works by Minnelli, Nicholas Ray, George Cukor, Billy Wilder and Joseph Losey acquired cult status among gay men because of the &quot;very excessiveness, extreme emotionality, mannered performances, style and very direct sentimental form of address that these films demonstrate&quot;. Several features of the family melodrama, later emphasized by film theorists as integral to the subversive and progressive essence of the genre, were precisely the attributes that gay men found humorous. Several later exponents of gay cinema, like John Waters, Pedro Almodóvar, Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Todd Haynes, among others, have cited campy melodramas as a major influence.

Famous representatives of camp films are, for example, John Waters &quot;(Pink Flamingos, 1972)&quot; and Rosa von Praunheim &quot;(The Bed Sausage, 1971)&quot;, who mainly used this style in the 1970s, and who created films which achieved cult status. The 1972 musical &quot;Cabaret&quot; is also seen as an example of the aesthetic, with film critic Esther Leslie describing the camp in the film thus:Camp thrives on tragic gestures, on lament at the transience of life, on an excess of sentiment, an ironic sensibility that art and artifice is preferable to nature and health, in a Wildean sense.Australian writer/director Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s Red Curtain Trilogy, in particular the film &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; (1992), has been described as camp.
The term camp is also used prominently in the horror genre, with examples including Killer Klowns from Outer Space, or The Evil Dead franchise.

=== Literature ===
&quot;Dandyism&quot; is often seen as a precursor to camp, especially as embodied in Oscar Wilde and his work. The character of Amarinth in Robert Hichens&#x27; &quot;The Green Carnation&quot; (1894), based on Wilde, uses &quot;camp coding&quot; in his &quot;effusive and inverted&quot; use of language.

The scene where Anthony Blanche arrives late to Sebastian Flyte&#x27;s lunch party in Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot;, has been described by writer George Melly as an example of &quot;camp&quot;&#x27;s &quot;alchemical ability&quot; to project a queer sensibility upon the world and unite one&#x27;s peers in that sensibility.

The first post-World War II use of the word in print may be Christopher Isherwood&#x27;s 1954 novel &quot;The World in the Evening&quot;, where he comments: &quot;You can&#x27;t camp about something you don&#x27;t take seriously. You&#x27;re not making fun of it; you&#x27;re making fun &quot;out&quot; of it. You&#x27;re expressing what&#x27;s basically serious to you in terms of fun and artifice and elegance.&quot;

In the American writer Susan Sontag&#x27;s 1964 essay &quot;Notes on &quot;Camp&quot;&quot;, Sontag emphasized the embrace of artifice, frivolity, naivety, pretentiousness, offensiveness, and excess as key elements of camp. Examples cited by Sontag included Tiffany lamps, the drawings of Aubrey Beardsley, Tchaikovsky&#x27;s ballet &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, and Japanese science fiction films such as &quot;Rodan&quot; and &quot;The Mysterians&quot; of the 1950s. However, critics of Sontag&#x27;s description, such as art historian David Carrier, say that it is outdated and that &quot;her celebration of its ecstatic marginality downplays its implicit subversiveness&quot;.

In Mark Booth&#x27;s 1983 book &quot;Camp&quot;, he defines camp as &quot;to present oneself as being committed to the marginal with a commitment greater than the marginal merits&quot;. He makes a distinction between genuine &quot;camp&quot;, and &quot;camp fads and fancies —&quot; things that are not intrinsically camp, but display artificiality, stylization, theatricality, naivety, sexual ambiguity, tackiness, poor taste, stylishness, or camp people, and thus appeal to them.

In his 1984 book &quot;Camp: The Lie That Tells The Truth&quot;, writer and artist Philip Core describes Jean Cocteau&#x27;s autobiography as &quot;the definition of camp&quot;.

In 1993, journalist Russell Davies published comedian Kenneth Williams&#x27; diaries. Williams&#x27; diary entry for 1 January 1947 reads: &quot;Went to Singapore with Stan—very camp evening, was followed, but tatty types so didn&#x27;t bother to make overtures.&quot;

=== Music ===
American singer and actress Cher is one of the artists who received the title of &quot;Queen of Camp&quot; through her colourful on-stage fashion and live performances. She gained this status in the 1970s when she launched her variety shows in collaboration with the costume designer Bob Mackie and became a constant presence on American prime-time television. Madonna is also considered camp and according to educator Carol Queen, her &quot;whole career up to and including &quot;Sex&quot; has depended heavily on camp imagery and camp understandings of gender and sex&quot;. Madonna has also been named &quot;Queen of Camp&quot;.

In public and on stage, Dusty Springfield developed an image supported by her peroxide blonde beehive hairstyle, evening gowns, and heavy make-up that included her much-copied &quot;panda eye&quot; look. Springfield borrowed elements of her look from blonde glamour queens of the 1950s, such as Brigitte Bardot and Catherine Deneuve. This, her singing style and her sexuality made her a &quot;camp icon&quot; and won her a following in the gay community. Besides the prototypical female drag queen, she was presented in the roles of the &quot;Great White Lady&quot; of pop and soul, and the &quot;Queen of Mods&quot;.

Rappers such as Lil&#x27; Kim, Nicki Minaj and Cam&#x27;ron have all been described as camp, often because of the opulence and winking humour of their personas. Dapper Dan has been credited with introducing high fashion and camp to hip hop. In pop and rock, musicians Prince and Jimi Hendrix have also been called camp because of their flamboyance and playful use of artifice.

South Korean rapper Psy, known for his viral internet music videos full of flamboyant dance and visuals, has come to be seen as a 21st-century incarnation of camp style. Geri Halliwell is recognized as a camp icon for her high camp aesthetics, performance style and kinship with the gay community during her time as a solo artist.

Dancer, singer and actress Josephine Baker has been described as &quot;camp.&quot; Her famous banana dress has been noted as particularly camp for its flamboyant, humorous and ironic qualities, as well as the way it makes a political point using outdated but reclaimed imagery.

Lady Gaga, a contemporary exemplar of camp, uses music and dance to make social commentary on pop culture, as in the &quot;Judas&quot; music video. Her clothes, makeup, and accessories, created by high-end fashion designers, are integral to the narrative structure of her performances. Katy Perry has also been described as camp, with outlets like &quot;Vogue&quot; describing her as another &quot;Queen of Camp&quot;.

The British tradition of the &quot;Last Night of the Proms&quot; has been said to glory in &quot;nostalgia, camp, and pastiche&quot;. &quot;Camp&quot; still forms a strong element in UK culture, and many so-called gay icons and objects are chosen as such because they are camp, including musicians such as Elton John, Kylie Minogue, Lulu, and Mika.

Musicologist Philip Brett has highlighted campness in the work of Benjamin Britten and has also argued for a camp reading of French composer Francis Poulenc&#x27;s &quot;Concerto for Two Pianos in D minor&quot;, noting its combination of a Balinese gamelan with a sense of &quot;musical resignation and longing&quot;.

Musicologist Raymond Knapp has compared &quot;musical camp&quot; to jazz, especially in camp&#x27;s playfulness and admiration for its subjects, which can seem mocking but often borders on veneration. He argues that musical camp draws attention to its performativity and inspirations, while engaging the audience interactively in the process of creating meaning.

=== Photography ===
Thomas Dworzak published a collection of &quot;last portrait&quot; photographs of young Taliban soldiers about to depart for the front, found in Kabul photo studios. The book, titled &quot;Taliban&quot;, attests to a campy aesthetic, quite close to the gay movement in California or a Peter Greenaway film.

=== Television ===
The Comedy Central television show &quot;Strangers with Candy&quot; (1999–2000), starring comedian Amy Sedaris, was a camp spoof of the &quot;ABC Afterschool Special&quot; genre. Inspired by the work of George Kuchar and his brother Mike Kuchar, ASS Studios began making a series of short, no-budget camp films. Their feature film &quot;Satan, Hold My Hand&quot; (2013) features many elements recognized in camp pictures.

Since 2000, the Eurovision Song Contest, an annually televised competition of song performers from different countries, has shown an increasing element of camp—since the contest has shown an increasing attraction within the LGBTQ+ communities—in their stage performances. This is especially true during the televised finale, which is screened live across Europe. As it is a visual show, many Eurovision performances attempt to attract the attention of voters through means other than the music, which sometimes leads to bizarre onstage gimmicks, and what some critics have called &quot;the Eurovision kitsch drive&quot;, with almost cartoonish novelty acts performing.

=== Theatre ===
The Australian theatre and opera director Barrie Kosky is renowned for his use of camp in interpreting the works of the Western canon, including Shakespeare, Wagner, Molière, Seneca and Kafka. His 2006 eight-hour production for the Sydney Theatre Company &quot;The Lost Echo&quot; was based on Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; and Euripides&#x27;s &quot;The Bacchae&quot;. In the first act (&quot;The Song of Phaeton&quot;), for instance, the goddess Juno takes the form of a highly stylized Marlene Dietrich, and the musical arrangements feature Noël Coward and Cole Porter. Kosky&#x27;s use of camp is also effectively employed to satirize the pretensions, manners, and cultural vacuity of Australia&#x27;s suburban middle class, which is suggestive of the style of Dame Edna Everage. For example, in &quot;The Lost Echo&quot;, Kosky employs a chorus of high school students: one girl in the chorus takes leave from the goddess Diana, and begins to rehearse a dance routine, muttering to herself in a broad Australian accent, &quot;Mum says I have to practice if I want to be on &quot;Australian Idol&quot;.&quot;

In the UK, the music hall tradition of pantomime, which often uses drag and other features of &quot;camp&quot;, remains a popular form of entertainment for families and young children. Most towns and cities in the UK stage at least one pantomime between November and February, drawing in an estimated £146 million in 2014.

== Distinguishing between kitsch and camp ==
The words &quot;camp&quot; and &quot;kitsch&quot; are often used interchangeably, though they are distinct. &quot;Camp&quot; is rooted in a specifically queer sensibility, informed by queer identity and culture, whereas &quot;kitsch&quot; is rooted in the rise of mass-produced art and popular culture for the mainstream. Both terms may relate to an object or work that carries aesthetic value, but &quot;kitsch&quot; refers specifically to the work itself, whereas &quot;camp&quot; is a sensibility as well as a mode of performance. A person may consume &quot;kitsch&quot; intentionally or unintentionally, but &quot;camp&quot;, as Susan Sontag observed, is always a way of consuming or performing culture &quot;in quotation marks&quot;.

Sontag also distinguishes between &quot;naïve&quot; and &quot;deliberate&quot; &quot;camp&quot;, and examines Christopher Isherwood&#x27;s distinction between &quot;low camp —&quot; which he associated with cross-dressing and drag performances — and &quot;high camp&quot; — which included &quot;the whole emotional basis of the Ballet, for example, and of course of Baroque art&quot;. &quot;High camp&quot; has also been used to describe drag that is more subtle or ironic, as opposed to drag that is more parodic and obvious (and thus &quot;low camp&quot;).

According to sociologist Andrew Ross, &quot;camp&quot; combines outmoded and contemporary forms of style, fashion, and technology. Often characterized by the reappropriation of a &quot;throwaway Pop aesthetic&quot;, camp works to intermingle the categories of &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; culture. Objects may become camp objects because of their historical association with a power now in decline. As opposed to kitsch, camp reappropriates culture in an ironic fashion, whereas kitsch is indelibly sincere. Additionally, kitsch may be seen as a quality of an object, while camp &quot;tends to refer to a subjective process&quot;. Those who identify objects as &quot;camp&quot; note the distance often apparent in the process through which &quot;unexpected value can be located in some obscure or exorbitant object.&quot;

In its subversiveness and irony, camp can also suggest the possibility of overturning the status quo, making it a far more &quot;radical spectacle&quot; than &quot;kitsch&quot;. Musicologist Philip Brett has described camp as:a strategy which confronts un-queer ontology [states of being] and homophobia with humor and which by those same means may also signal the possibility of the overturn of that ontology—as when, on a famous night in 1969, the evening of the funeral of Judy Garland, the mood of a group of gays and drag queens reveling in the spectacle of their own arrest by members of the New York City Vice Squad at the Stonewall Bar turned to one of rage and produced the event that solidified the lesbian and gay movement.

<doc id="84018" wikidata="Q16736999" url="?curid=84018" title="Politics of Tuvalu">
<text>The politics of [[Tuvalu]] takes place in a framework of a parliamentary representative democratic monarchy, whereby the monarch is the head of state, represented by the governor-general, while the prime minister is the head of government. Executive power is exercised by the government.

The &quot;Constitution of Tuvalu&quot; states that it is &quot;the supreme law of Tuvalu&quot; and that &quot;all other laws shall be interpreted and applied subject to this Constitution&quot;; it sets out the Principles of the Bill of Rights and the Protection of the Fundamental Rights and Freedoms. In 1986 the Constitution adopted upon independence was amended in order to give attention to Tuvaluan custom and tradition as well as the aspirations and values of the Tuvaluan people. The changes placed greater emphasis on Tuvaluan community values rather than Western concepts of individual freedom. The Constitution of Tuvalu Act 2023, further addressed the role of Tuvaluan culture, and also referred to the climate crisis, and Tuvalu’s statehood and national boundaries.

Tuvalu follows the Westminster system of representative democracy although Tuvalu is a non-partisan democracy and elections in Tuvalu take place without reference to formal political parties. At the date of independence there were 12 members of the Parliament of Tuvalu. Amendments to the Electoral Provisions (Parliament) Act in 1999 &amp; 2000 increased the membership of parliament to 15 MPs. The Electoral Provisions (Parliament) Amendment Act 2019 increased the number of elected representatives for the electorate of Nukulaelae to become 2 MPs. So that each of the 8 island electorates is represented by 2 MPs, with Niulakita being represented by the MPs from Niutao.

The 16 members of the current parliament are elected from eight two-seat constituencies via plurality block voting.

Tuvaluans participated in the political institutions of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony during the transition to self-determination. A referendum was held in December 1974 to determine whether the Gilbert Islands and Ellice Islands should each have their own administration. As a consequence of the referendum the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony ceased to exist on 1 January 1976 and the separate British colonies of Kiribati and Tuvalu came into existence.

In 2008 Tuvaluans rejected a constitutional referendum that proposed replacing the queen of Tuvalu, with an elected president as the head of state.

==Executive branch==

|Governor-General
| The Rev. Sir Tofiga Vaevalu Falani 
|28 September 2021
|Prime Minister

|26 February 2024
King Charles III—as the King of Tuvalu—is the head of state, represented by the governor-general, who is appointed by the King on advice of the Prime Minister of Tuvalu. The prime minister is elected by the members of the parliament. The members also elect the Speaker of the Parliament of Tuvalu who is the presiding officer of the parliament. The ministers that form the cabinet are appointed by the governor-general on the advice of the prime minister. The Attorney-General sits in parliament, but does not vote: the parliamentary role of the Attorney-General is purely advisory. The current Attorney-General is Laingane Italeli Talia.

The Office of the Prime Minister supports the prime minister and the deputy prime minister and also has responsibility for the public service, the police, immigration, broadcasting and media. The Cabinet of Tuvalu consists of the Prime Minister and eight ministers, who are allocated the portfolios made up of the government departments that each minister supervises.

During the governments of Bikenibeu Paeniu, Ionatana Ionatana, and Faimalaga Luka, members of parliament who were not ministers were appointed to positions described variously as ‘Special Ministerial Advisers” and “Parliamentarians with Special Responsibilities” and, in one case, as Chairman of a Public Service Reform Committee. A decision of the High Court of Tuvalu in 2003 determined that “Cabinet did not have the power to make these appointments and the purported use of such a power was unlawful.”

==Judicial branch==

Tuvalu maintains an independent judiciary consisting of a High Court, Magistrates Court on Funafuti and Island Courts and Lands Courts on each island. Appeals in relation to land disputes are made to the Lands Courts Appeal Panel. Appeals from the Island Courts and the Lands Courts Appeal Panel are made to the Magistrates Court, which has jurisdiction to hear civil cases involving up to $10,000. The superior court is the High Court of Tuvalu as it has unlimited original jurisdiction and hears appeals from the lower courts. The senior judicial officer is the Chief Justice of Tuvalu. Rulings of the High Court can be appealed to the Court of Appeal of Tuvalu. From the Court of Appeal there is a right of appeal to Her Majesty in Council, i.e., the Privy Council in London.

The law of Tuvalu comprises the Acts voted into law by the Parliament of Tuvalu and statutory instruments that become law; certain Acts passed by the Parliament of the UK (during the time Tuvalu was either a British protectorate or British colony); the common law; and customary law (particularly in relation to the ownership of land).

==Legislative branch==

The legislative branch is the unicameral Parliament of Tuvalu or &quot;Palamene o Tuvalu&quot; has 16 members, elected for a four-year term in 8 double-seat constituencies, so that each of the 8 island electorates is represented by 2 MPs, with (Niulakita is represented by the MPs from Niutao). During the time that Tuvalu was a British Dependency the parliament was called the House of Assembly or &quot;Fale I Fono&quot;.

==Ombudsman==
In 2014 the office of the Chief Ombudsman was established, with the appointment of Sa&#x27;aga Talu Teafa. The primary role of the Chief Ombudsman is to work to achieve good governance through the enforcement of the Leadership Code Act.

==Democratic values in Tuvalu==
===Democratic, non-partisan politics===
Democratic values in Tuvalu are strong with free elections every 4 years by universal adult suffrage. There are no formal political parties so all candidates are non-partisan, and election campaigns are largely on the basis of personal/family ties and reputation. Tuvalu has &quot;about 6,000 eligible voters&quot; – a little over half the country&#x27;s population.

Members of parliament have very close ties to the island they represent. Often the northern islands in the country compete against the southern islands with the center holding the balance of power. Traditional chiefs also still play a significant role in influencing island affairs, particularly on the outer islands. A long-held distinction between chiefs and commoners is slowly disappearing, and chiefs are now more often selected on merit rather than by birth.

&quot;Te Kakeega II&quot; is the statement of the national strategy for the sustainable development of Tuvalu, with goals intended to be achieved in the period 2005 to 2015. After consultations on each islands the National Summit on Sustainable Development (NSSD), was held at the &quot;Tausoalima Falekaupule&quot; in Funafuti from 28 June to 9 July 2004. The meeting resulted in the &quot;Malefatuga&quot; Declaration, which is the foundation of &quot;Te Kakeega II&quot;.

In November 2020 the name &quot;Te Kakeega” was replaced by “Te Kete” which is the name of a domestic traditional basket woven from green or brown coconut leaves. Symbolically, “Te Kete” has biblical significance for Tuvaluan Christian traditions by referencing to the basket or the cradle that saved the life of Moses.

===Representation of women===
Throughout the history of the Parliament of Tuvalu three women have been elected: Naama Maheu Latasi, from 1989 to 1997; and Pelenike Isaia who was elected in a by-election in 2011, serving until the 2015 general election; and Dr Puakena Boreham was elected to represent Nui in the 2015 general election, serving until the 2024 general election.

The under-representation of women in the Tuvalu parliament was discussed during a consultation entitled &quot;Promoting Women in Decision Making&quot; was held in Funafuti in May 2010. The outcome was a recommendation for the introduction of two new seats, to be reserved for women. The Tuvaluan Ministry for Home Affairs, which has responsibility for women&#x27;s affairs, stated that steps would be taken to consider the recommendation.

===The frequent use of the motion of non-confidence in the prime minister===
Tuvalu does not face serious governance issues. The frequent use of the parliamentary vote of no confidence, engendering many changes of government in relatively short periods, has sometimes been on issues which reflect on the relations between personalities rather than on pressing national issues. The apparent reasons for the resort to motions of no confidence in the prime minister in the period 1999 to 2004 were: the PM straying from policies supported by the majority caucus; claims that the PM was inefficient or ineffective; and accusations of corruption in making appointments.

During this period of time the terms of the prime minister were short. Bikenibeu Paeniu resigned as prime minister following the vote on a motion of no confidence on 27 April 1999. Ionatana Ionatana was elected as prime minister. After the death of prime minister Ionatana on 8 December 2000, Lagitupu Tuilimu was acting prime minister from 8 December 2000 to 24 February 2001. Faimalaga Luka became the prime minister on 24 February 2001 until he was replaced by Koloa Talake after a vote of no confidence on 14 December 2001. Koloa Talake was appointed prime minister until he was voted out of office as a result of the vote at the 2002 Tuvaluan general election.

Following the elections held on 25 July 2002 six of the 15 members elected to parliament were serving for the first time. Saufatu Sopoanga, a former civil servant, became prime minister in August 2002. It was expected that Tuvalu would have a period of political stability. However the Sopoanga government lost its majority in May 2003, following the results of the 2003 Nanumea by-election and the 2003 Niutao by-election. Amasone Kilei, the leader of the opposition, wrote to the governor-general on 10 May 2003 advising that he commanded the support of a majority of the members of parliament and they were ready to form a government. On 20 June 2003 Amasone Kilei commenced an action in the High Court of Tuvalu seeking order regarding the appointment of a speaker and the calling of parliament. As it happened, the governor-general had, on 19 June 2003, issued a notice for the meeting to elect a speaker. In June 2003 opposition MP Faimalaga Luka became speaker of parliament. However parliament was not called. On 6 August 2003 the High Court declined to make the declaration that the prime minister must resign; however the Chief Justice delivered directions as to how the governor-general should proceed to take any action he considers to be appropriate under Section 116(1), acting in his own deliberate judgment, rather than as advised by the cabinet. That is, the governor-general could consider whether it was appropriate to exercise his reserve powers in calling parliament.

On 9 September Sopoanga arranged to appointed opposition MP Faimalaga Luka as governor general, depriving the opposition of its crucial one-seat majority and triggering the 2003 Nukufetau by-election. The winner of the October by-election, Elisala Pita, joined the government&#x27;s benches, enabling it to survive a while longer. The Sopoanga government was eventually brought down by an eight-to-six motion of no confidence in August 2004. Saufatu Sopoanga resigned as prime minister and member of parliament on 25 August 2004. Two government members, Elisala Pita and Otinielu Tausi, crossed the floor to vote against Sopoanga. The 2004 Nukufetau by-election was held on 7 October and Saufatu Sopoanga regained his seat. Maatia Toafa was elected prime minister on 11 October 2004 with a vote of 8:7; and Saufatu Sopoanga became deputy prime minister and minister for works transport and communication.

Apisai Ielemia became prime minister following the 2006 Tuvaluan general election that was held on 3 August 2006. Many of the incumbent government ministers under the previous government of Maatia Toafa lost their re-election bids for the Tuvaluan parliament. While Apisai Ielemia was re-elected as a member of parliament in the 2010 Tuvaluan general election, he was not re-elected as the prime minister.

These frequent motions of non-confidence and changes of prime minister have been described as having a number of possible explanations: a new generation of politicians who were less deferential to the prime minister as compared to the immediate post-independence parliaments; politicians who were more willing to engage in tactical voting; and competition for the portfolios that come with higher salaries compared to that of an ordinary MP. The larger than usual turnover of MPs at the 2002 and 2006 elections may have indicated a reaction by the electorate to the frequent changes of PM.

There were three prime ministers in the period from 2010 to 2019.

==Recent general elections==
===The 2024 general election===
Voting in the general election that was held on 26 January 2024 began at 8:00 local time (UTC+12:00), and ended at 16:00.

Six new MPs were elected to Tuvalu&#x27;s 16-member parliament. Significant changes to the composition of the parliament include the former Prime Minister Kausea Natano not retaining his seat; the former Governor General Sir Iakoba Italeli Taeia was elected as an MP and also Feleti Teo, who was the former Executive Director of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC).

Enele Sopoaga, the prime minister from 2013 to 2019, was re-elected in the Nukufetau electorate. Former foreign minister Simon Kofe retained his seat in the Funafuti electorate. No candidates contested the sitting MPs Seve Paeniu, who was the finance minister, and Namoliki Sualiki in the electorate of Nukulaelae, so they were automatically returned to parliament.

Feleti Teo was appointed as prime minister on 26 February 2024, after he was elected unopposed by the parliament. On 27 February, Sir Iakoba Italeli was elected as the Speaker of the Parliament of Tuvalu in an uncontested ballot.

===The 2019 general election===
The 2019 general election was held on 9 September 2019. In the Nukufetau electorate the caretaker prime minister, Enele Sopoaga, was returned to parliament, however Satini Manuella, Taukelina Finikaso and Maatia Toafa, who were ministers, were not returned. Seven new members of Parliament were elected.

On 19 September 2019, in a secret ballot, the members of parliament elected Kausea Natano from Funafuti as prime minister with a 10-6 majority, ending the six-year premiership of Enele Sopoaga. Samuelu Teo was elected as Speaker of the Parliament of Tuvalu.

===The 2015 general election===
The general election was held in Tuvalu on 31 March 2015. The state of emergency created by Cyclone Pam resulted in the election being delayed twice. The election was originally scheduled for 19 March, then after Cyclone Pam caused damage to the islands, the election was rescheduled.

In the Nukufetau electorate the caretaker prime minister, Enele Sopoaga, and the caretaker natural resources minister, Elisala Pita, were not opposed by other candidates. Namoliki Sualiki, the caretaker minister for home affairs and rural development, was not opposed in the Nukulaelae electorate. The other islands had contested ballots. The candidates in the constituencies of Niutao and Nui included former members of parliament. On Nui Pelenike Isaia and Leneuoti Matusi were not returned to parliament. On Nuitao Vete Sakaio, the deputy-prime minister, was not elected; the election was otherwise a good result for the government of Enele Sopoaga. Enele Sopoaga was sworn in as prime minister and appointed the ministers to the cabinet on 10 April.

===The 2010 general election===

Parliament was dissolved on 13 August 2010, and registration began on 28 August 2010. Twenty-six candidates, including all sitting members of parliament, stood for the fifteen seats in Parliament. In total, ten MPs were re-elected, while five incumbent MPs lost their seats.

==Changes in government (2010-2019)==

===Election of the Maatia Toafa government in September 2010===

Approximately one and a half weeks after the 2010 general election, a secret ballot was held on 29 September 2010 to determine the country&#x27;s next prime minister. The incumbent prime minister Apisai Ielemia was not returned to a second term. Maatia Toafa won the ballot with eight votes to seven and become Tuvalu&#x27;s prime minister. Toafa narrowly defeated Kausea Natano, who received the votes of seven MPs in the ballot. The election results were announced by governor-general Iakoba Italeli and Toafa took office the same day.

===Maatia Toafa government succeeded by the Willy Telavi government in December 2010===

On 24 December 2010, a motion of no confidence against Maatia Toafa was carried by eight votes to seven. On 25 December 2010 Willy Telavi was elected prime minister with an (8:7) majority over Enele Sopoaga.

Minister of Works Isaia Italeli died suddenly in July 2011, which led to a by-election in the Nui constituency in the following month. The election was won by his widow, Pelenike Isaia, who became only the second woman ever to have sat in the Tuvaluan parliament. The by-election was described as &quot;pivotal&quot;, as Italeli&#x27;s death had deprived Prime Minister Willy Telavi of his government&#x27;s one seat majority in parliament. Pelenike Isaia&#x27;s election restored it, strengthening the government.

===The dismissal of the government of Willy Telavi in August 2013===

Lotoala Metia, the Minister of Finance, died on 21 December 2012. The calling of a by-election was delayed until the High Court of Tuvalu ordered the prime minister to issue a notice to hold the by-election. The 2013 Nukufetau by-election was held on 28 June. The Nukufetau by-election was won by the opposition candidate Elisala Pita. A constitutional crisis developed when prime minister Telavi responded that, under the Constitution, he was only required to convene parliament once a year, and was thus under no obligation to summon it until December 2013.

Tuvalu&#x27;s opposition then requested the governor-general Iakoba Italeli to intervene against the prime minister&#x27;s decision. On 3 July the governor-general exercised his reserve powers in ordering parliament to convene.

The parliament convened on 30 July 2013. In an attempt to avoid a vote of no confidence, prime minister Willy Telavi tabled a motion to dissolve parliament, but this was subsequently defeated by the opposition by 8 votes to 5. The same day Taom Tanukale, the health minister, resigned from the parliament (and thus also from the government). His resignation appeared to be political manoeuvre as Willy Telavi responded by insisting that parliament should be suspended until a by-election was held and declined to call the by-election. In Tuvalu a by-election can only be called when requested by the prime minister.

The governor-general then proceeded to exercise his reserve powers to order Mr Telavi&#x27;s removal and the appointment of Enele Sopoaga as interim prime minister. The governor-general also ordered that parliament sit on Friday 2 August to allow a vote of no-confidence in Mr Telavi and his government. Telavi then proceeded to write to Queen Elizabeth II (as the head of state of Tuvalu) informing her that he was dismissing Mr Italeli from his position as governor-general. The Queen gave no indication of her reaction to Telavi&#x27;s letter, leaving Italeli&#x27;s position secure.

On Friday 2 August Willy Tevali faced a motion of no confidence; the voting was eight for the motion, four against and one abstention - the speaker of parliament abstained from voting on the motion.

=== The government of Enele Sopoaga 2013-2019 ===
On Sunday 4 August 2013 the parliament elected Enele Sopoaga as prime minister; and Vete Sakaio was subsequently appointed deputy prime minister and minister for public utilities, Maatia Toafa was appointed the minister of finance and economic development and Taukelina Finikaso was appointed the foreign minister.

The 2013 Nui by-election was held on 10 September. Leneuoti Maatusi was declared the winner, polling 297 of the 778 registered voters. Maatusi has been a civil servant and served as the secretary of the Nui Falekaupule. He beat Palemene Anelu, a recent graduate of the University of the South Pacific, who received 206 votes and Taom Tanukale, the sitting member, whose resignation from parliament caused the by-election, who received 160 votes. The government of Enele Sopoaga had a majority of two going into the by-election. After the by-election Leneuoti Maatusi committed to support prime minister Enele Sopoaga.

In December 2013 a vacancy for the constituency of Nanumaga was declared by the governor-general in accordance with Section 99 (2) of the Tuvalu Constitution following an assessment of Falesa Pitoi&#x27;s health. The 2014 Nanumaga by-election occurred on 14 January. The candidates were Halo Tuavai, Otinielu Tausi and Pai Teatu. Otinielu Tausi was the successful candidate. Tausi supported prime minister Enele Sopoaga, which gave the government a two-thirds majority of the members of parliament. On 3 March 2014 Tausi was elected as the speaker of the parliament.

In 2015 the parliament was dissolved with a general 2015 general election set down for 19 March 2015. Following the election Enele Sopoaga was sworn in as prime minister. The Sopoaga Ministry lasted until the 2019 general election; following which the Natano Ministry became the government.

<text>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is a standards organization that oversees global IP address allocation, autonomous system number allocation, root zone management in the Domain Name System (DNS), media types, and other Internet Protocol–related symbols and Internet numbers.

Currently it is a function of ICANN, a nonprofit private American corporation established in 1998 primarily for this purpose under a United States Department of Commerce contract. ICANN managed IANA directly from 1998 through 2016, when it was transferred to Public Technical Identifiers (PTI), an affiliate of ICANN that operates IANA today. Before it, IANA was administered principally by Jon Postel at the Information Sciences Institute (ISI) of the University of Southern California (USC) situated at Marina Del Rey (Los Angeles), under a contract USC/ISI had with the United States Department of Defense.

In addition, five regional Internet registries delegate number resources to their customers, local Internet registries, Internet service providers, and end-user organizations. A local Internet registry is an organization that assigns parts of its allocation from a regional Internet registry to other customers. Most local Internet registries are also Internet service providers.

==Responsibilities==
IANA is broadly responsible for the allocation of globally unique names and numbers that are used in Internet protocols that are published as Request for Comments (RFC) documents. These documents describe methods, behaviors, research, or innovations applicable to the working of the Internet and Internet-connected systems. IANA maintains a close liaison with the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and RFC Editorial team in fulfilling this function.

In the case of the two major Internet namespaces, namely IP addresses and domain names, extra administrative policy and delegation to subordinate administrations is required because of the multi-layered distributed use of these resources.

IANA is responsible for assignment of Internet numbers, which are numerical identifiers assigned to an Internet resource or used in the networking protocols of the Internet Protocol Suite. Examples include IP addresses and autonomous system (AS) numbers.

===IP addresses===

IANA delegates allocations of IP address blocks to regional Internet registries (RIRs). Each RIR allocates addresses for a different area of the world. Collectively the RIRs have created the Number Resource Organization formed as a body to represent their collective interests and ensure that policy statements are coordinated globally.

The RIRs divide their allocated address pools into smaller blocks and delegate them to Internet service providers and other organizations in their operating regions. Since the introduction of the CIDR system, IANA has typically allocated address space in the size of /8 prefix blocks for IPv4 and /23 to/12 prefix blocks from the 2000::/3 IPv6 block to requesting regional registries as needed. Since the exhaustion of the Internet Protocol Version 4 address space, no further IPv4 address space is allocated by IANA.

===Domain names===
IANA administers the data in the root nameservers, which form the top of the hierarchical Domain Name System (DNS) tree. This task involves liaising with top-level domain &quot;Registrar-of-Record&quot;s, the root nameserver operators, and ICANN&#x27;s policy making apparatus.

Since the root zone was cryptographically signed in 2010, IANA is also responsible for vital parts of the key management for the DNSSEC operations (specifically, it is the &quot;Root Zone KSK Operator&quot;). Among other things, this involves regularly holding signing ceremonies where members of a group of Trusted Community Representatives (TCR) physically meet at a predefined location and go through scripted procedures to generate key material and signing keys. The TCRs cannot be affiliated with ICANN, PTI (an ICANN affiliate) or Verisign because of these organizations&#x27; operational roles in the key management, but are chosen from the broader DNS community. Past and present TCRs include Vinton Cerf, Dan Kaminsky, Dmitry Burkov, Anne-Marie Eklund Löwinder and John Curran.

IANA operates the int registry for international treaty organizations, the arpa zone for Internet infrastructure purposes, including reverse DNS service, and other critical zones such as root-servers.

===Protocol assignments===
IANA maintains protocol registries in tables of protocols and their parameters and coordinates registration of protocols. As of 2015 there were over 2,800 registries and subregistries.

===Time zone database===
The &quot;IANA time zone database&quot; holds the time zone differences and rules for the various regions of the world and allows this information to be mirrored and used by computers and other electronic devices to maintain proper configuration for timekeeping.

IANA assumed responsibility for the database on October 16, 2011, after the &quot;Astrolabe, Inc. v. Olson et al.&quot; decision caused the shutdown of the FTP server which had previously been the primary source of the database.

===Language subtag registry===

The IANA Language Subtag Registry was defined by IETF RFC5646 and maintained by IANA.

==History==
IANA was established informally as a reference to various technical functions for the ARPANET, that Jon Postel and Joyce K. Reynolds performed at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) and at the University of Southern California&#x27;s Information Sciences Institute.
On March 26, 1972, Vint Cerf and Jon Postel at UCLA called for establishing a socket number catalog in RFC 322. Network administrators were asked to submit a note or place a phone call, &quot;describing the function and socket numbers of network service programs at each HOST&quot;. This catalog was subsequently published as RFC 433 in December 1972. In it Postel first proposed a registry of assignments of port numbers to network services, calling himself the &quot;czar of socket numbers&quot;.

The first reference to the name &quot;IANA&quot; in the RFC series is in RFC 1083, published in December 1988 by Postel at USC-ISI, referring to Joyce K. Reynolds as the IANA contact. However, the function, and the term, was well established long before that; RFC 1174 says that &quot;Throughout its entire history, the Internet system has employed a central Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)...&quot;

In 1995, the National Science Foundation authorized Network Solutions to assess domain name registrants a $50 fee per year for the first two years, 30 percent of which was to be deposited in the Intellectual Infrastructure Fund (IIF), a fund to be used for the preservation and enhancement of the intellectual infrastructure of the Internet. There was widespread dissatisfaction with this concentration of power (and money) in one company, and people looked to IANA for a solution. Postel wrote up a draft on IANA and the creation of new top-level domains. He was trying to institutionalize IANA. In retrospect, this would have been valuable, since he unexpectedly died about two years later.

In January 1998, Postel was threatened by US Presidential science advisor Ira Magaziner with the statement &quot;You&#x27;ll never work on the Internet again&quot; after Postel collaborated with root server operators to test using a root server other than Network Solutions&#x27; &quot;A&quot; root to act as the authority over the root zone. Demonstrating that control of the root was from the IANA rather than from Network Solutions would have clarified IANA&#x27;s authority to create new top-level domains as a step to resolving the DNS Wars, but he ended his effort after Magaziner&#x27;s threat, and died not long after.

Jon Postel managed the IANA function from its inception on the ARPANET until his death in October 1998. By his almost 30 years of &quot;selfless service&quot;, Postel created his de facto authority to manage key parts of the Internet infrastructure. After his death, Joyce K. Reynolds, who had worked with him for many years, managed the transition of the IANA function to ICANN.

Starting in 1988, IANA was funded by the U.S. government under a contract between the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Information Sciences Institute. This contract expired in April 1997, but was extended to preserve IANA.

On December 24, 1998, USC entered into a transition agreement with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ICANN, transferring the IANA project to ICANN, effective January 1, 1999, thus making IANA an operating unit of ICANN.

In June 1999, at its Oslo meeting, IETF signed an agreement with ICANN concerning the tasks that IANA would perform for the IETF; this is published as RFC 2860.

On February 8, 2000, the Department of Commerce entered into an agreement with ICANN for ICANN to perform the IANA functions.

On October 7, 2013 the Montevideo Statement on the Future of Internet Cooperation was released by the leaders of a number of organizations involved in coordinating the Internet&#x27;s global technical infrastructure, loosely known as the &quot;I*&quot; (or &quot;I-star&quot;) group. Among other things, the statement &quot;expressed strong concern over the undermining of the trust and confidence of Internet users globally due to recent revelations of pervasive monitoring and surveillance&quot; and &quot;called for accelerating the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions, towards an environment in which all stakeholders, including all governments, participate on an equal footing&quot;. This desire to move away from a United States centric approach is seen as a reaction to the ongoing NSA surveillance scandal. The statement was signed by the heads of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the Internet Engineering Task Force, the Internet Architecture Board, the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Society, and the five regional Internet address registries (African Network Information Center, American Registry for Internet Numbers, Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre, Latin America and Caribbean Internet Addresses Registry, and Réseaux IP Européens Network Coordination Centre).

In October 2013, Fadi Chehadé, current President and CEO of ICANN, met with Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff in Brasilia. Upon Chehadé&#x27;s invitation, the two announced that Brazil would host an international summit on Internet governance in April 2014. The announcement came after the 2013 disclosures of mass surveillance by the U.S. government, and President Rousseff&#x27;s speech at the opening session of the 2013 United Nations General Assembly, where she strongly criticized the American surveillance program as a &quot;breach of international law&quot;. The &quot;Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance (NET mundial)&quot; will include representatives of government, industry, civil society, and academia. At the IGF VIII meeting in Bali in October 2013 a commenter noted that Brazil intends the meeting to be a &quot;summit&quot; in the sense that it will be high level with decision-making authority. The organizers of the &quot;NET mundial&quot; meeting have decided that an online forum called &quot;/1net&quot;, set up by the I* group, will be a major conduit of non-governmental input into the three committees preparing for the meeting in April.

In April 2014 the NetMundial Initiative, a plan for international governance of the Internet, was proposed at the Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance (GMMFIG) conference (23–24 April 2014)
and later developed into the NetMundial Initiative by ICANN CEO Fadi Chehade along with representatives of the World Economic Forum (WEF)
and the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee (Comitê Gestor da Internet no Brasil), commonly referred to as &quot;CGI.br&quot;.

The meeting produced a nonbinding statement in favor of consensus-based decision-making. It reflected a compromise and did not harshly condemn mass surveillance or include the words &quot;net neutrality&quot;, despite initial support for that from Brazil. The final resolution says ICANN should be under international control by September 2015.
A minority of governments, including Russia, China, Iran and India, were unhappy with the final resolution and wanted multi-lateral management for the Internet, rather than broader multi-stakeholder management.

A month later, the Panel On Global Internet Cooperation and Governance Mechanisms (convened by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and the World Economic Forum (WEF) with assistance from The Annenberg Foundation), supported and included the NetMundial statement in its own report.

==Oversight==
IANA was managed by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) under contract with the United States Department of Commerce (DOC) and pursuant to an agreement with the IETF from 1998 to 2016. The Department of Commerce also provided an ongoing oversight function, whereby it verified additions and changes made in the DNS root zone to ensure IANA complied with its policies. The Internet Architecture Board (IAB), on behalf of the IETF, could terminate the agreement under which ICANN performs IANA functions with six months&#x27; notice.

ICANN and the Department of Commerce made an agreement for the &quot;joint development of the &quot;mechanisms methods, and procedures necessary to effect the transition of Internet domain name and addressing system (DNS) to the private sector&quot; via a &quot;Joint Project Agreement&quot; in 1998.

On January 28, 2003, the Department of Commerce, via the Acquisition and Grants Office of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, issued a notice of intent to extend the IANA contract for three years. In August 2006, the U.S. Department of Commerce extended the IANA contract with ICANN by an additional five years, subject to annual renewals.

Since ICANN is managing a worldwide resource, while the IANA function is contracted to ICANN by the US Department of Commerce, various proposals have been brought forward to decouple the IANA function from ICANN.

On October 1, 2009 the &quot;Joint Project Agreement&quot; between ICANN and U.S. Department of Commerce expired, replaced by an &quot;Affirmation of Commitments&quot;. On March 14, 2014, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced its intent to transition key Internet domain name functions to a global multi-stakeholder community.

In August 2016 ICANN incorporated Public Technical Identifiers, a non-profit affiliate corporation in California, to take over the IANA functions once the current contract expired at the end of September. The Department of Commerce confirmed that its criteria for transitioning IANA Stewardship to the Internet multistakeholder community had been met, and that it intended to allow its contract with ICANN to expire on September 30, 2016, allowing the transition to take effect. On October the contract between the United States Department of Commerce and ICANN to perform the IANA functions was allowed to expire and the stewardship of IANA functions was officially transitioned to the private-sector.

<doc id="84024" wikidata="Q1136773" url="?curid=84024" title="Matrilineality">
<text>Matrilineality, also called matriliny, is the tracing of kinship through the female line. It may also correlate with a social system in which each person is identified with their matriline, their mother&#x27;s lineage, and which can involve the inheritance of property and titles. A matriline is a line of descent from a female ancestor to a descendant of either gender in which the individuals in all intervening generations are mothers. In a matrilineal descent system, an individual is considered to belong to the same descent group as their mother. This ancient matrilineal descent pattern is in contrast to the currently more popular pattern of patrilineal descent from which a family name is usually derived. The &quot;matriline&quot; of historical nobility was also called their enatic or uterine ancestry, corresponding to the patrilineal or &quot;agnatic&quot; ancestry.

== Early human kinship ==
In the late 19th century, almost all prehistorians and anthropologists believed, following Lewis H. Morgan&#x27;s influential book &quot;Ancient Society&quot;, that early human kinship everywhere was matrilineal. This idea was taken up by Friedrich Engels in &quot;The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State&quot;. The Morgan-Engels thesis that humanity&#x27;s earliest domestic institution was not the family but the matrilineal clan soon became incorporated into communist orthodoxy. In reaction, most 20th century social anthropologists considered the theory of matrilineal priority untenable, although during the 1970s and 1980s, a range of feminist scholars often attempted to revive it.

In recent years, evolutionary biologists, geneticists and palaeoanthropologists have been reassessing the issues, many citing genetic and other evidence that early human kinship may have been matrilineal after all. One crucial piece of indirect evidence has been genetic data suggesting that over thousands of years, women among sub-Saharan African hunter-gatherers have chosen to reside postmaritally not with their husbands&#x27; family but with their own mother and other natal kin. Another line of argument is that when sisters and their mothers help each other with childcare, the descent line tends to be matrilineal rather than patrilineal. Biological anthropologists are now widely agreed that cooperative childcare was a development crucial in making possible the evolution of the unusually large human brain and characteristically human psychology. Although others refute the claims of supporters of the universality of matrilocality or patrilocality, pointing out that hunter-gatherer societies have a flexible philopatry or practice multilocality, which in turn leads to a more egalitarian society, since both men and women have the right to choose with whom to live. According to some data, pastoralists and farmers strongly gravitate towards patrilocality, so patrilocality is a common phenomenon among non-Pygmies. But among some hunter-gatherers, patrilocality is less common than among farmers. So for example, among the pygmies of Aka, which includes Biaka and Benzene, a young couple usually settles in her husband&#x27;s camp after the birth of their first child. However, the husband can stay in the wife&#x27;s community, where one of his brothers or sisters can join him. This can happen in societies where the bride&#x27;s service is practiced, or in any other societies. According to the data above, some scientists also say that kinship and residence in hunter-gatherer societies are complex and multifaceted. For example, when re-checking past data (which were not very reliable), the researchers note that about 40% of the groups were bilocal, 22.9% were matrilocal and 25% were patrilocal. A number of scientists also advocate multilocality, refuting the concepts of exceptional matrilocality (matrilineality) or patrilocality (patrilineality).

== Matrilineal surname == 
&quot;Matrilineal&quot; surnames are names transmitted from mother to daughter, in contrast to the more familiar &quot;patrilineal surnames&quot; transmitted from father to son, the pattern most common among family names today. For clarity and for brevity, the scientific terms &quot;patrilineal surname&quot; and &quot;matrilineal surname&quot; are usually abbreviated as &quot;patriname&quot; and &quot;matriname&quot;.

== Cultural patterns ==
There appears to be some evidence for the presence of matrilineality in Pre-Islamic Arabia, in a very limited number of the Arabian peoples (first of all among the Amorites of Yemen, and among some strata of Nabateans in Northern Arabia);

A modern example from South Africa is the order of succession to the position of the Rain Queen in a culture of matrilineal primogeniture: not only is dynastic descent reckoned through the female line, but only females are eligible to inherit.

In some traditional societies and cultures, membership in their groups was – and, in the following list, still &quot;is&quot; if shown in &quot;italics&quot; – inherited matrilineally. Examples include the Cherokee, Choctaw, &quot;Gitksan&quot;, Haida, Hopi, Iroquois, Lenape, Navajo and Tlingit of North America; the &quot;Cabécar&quot; and &quot;Bribri&quot; of Costa Rica; the &quot;Naso&quot; and &quot;Kuna people&quot; of Panama; the &quot;Kogi&quot;, &quot;Wayuu&quot; and Carib of South America; the &quot;Minangkabau&quot; people of West Sumatra, Indonesia and Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia; the &quot;Trobrianders&quot;, &quot;Dobu&quot; and &quot;Nagovisi&quot; of Melanesia; the Nairs, some Thiyyas &amp; Muslims of Kerala and the Mogaveeras, Billavas &amp; the Bunts of Karnataka in south India; the &quot;Khasi&quot;, &quot;Jaintia&quot; and &quot;Garo&quot; of Meghalaya in northeast India and Bangladesh; the &quot;Ngalops&quot; and &quot;Sharchops&quot; of Bhutan; the &quot;Mosuo&quot; of China; the &quot;Kayah&quot; of Southeast Asia, the Picti of Scotland, the Basques of Spain and France; the Ainu of Japan, the &quot;Akan&quot; including the &quot;Ashanti&quot;, &quot;Bono&quot;, &quot;Akwamu&quot;, &quot;Fante&quot; of Ghana; most groups across the so-called &quot;matrilineal belt&quot; of south-central Africa; the Nubians of Southern Egypt &amp; Sudan and the &quot;Tuareg&quot; of west and north Africa; the &quot;Serer&quot; of Senegal, The Gambia and Mauritania.

=== Clan names vs. surnames ===
Most of the example cultures in this article are based on (matrilineal) clans. Any clan might possibly contain from one to several or many &quot;descent groups&quot; or &quot;family groups&quot; – i.e., any matrilineal clan might be descended from one or several or many unrelated female ancestors. Also, each such descent group might have its own family name or &quot;surname&quot;, as one possible cultural pattern. The following two example cultures each follow a different pattern, however:

Example 1. Members of the (matrilineal) clan culture Minangkabau do not even have a &quot;surname&quot; or &quot;family name&quot;, see this culture&#x27;s own section below. In contrast, members do have a &quot;clan name&quot;, which is important in their lives although not included in the member&#x27;s name. Instead, one&#x27;s name is just one&#x27;s given name.

Example 2. Members of the (matrilineal) clan culture Akan, see its own section below, also do not have matrilineal &quot;surnames&quot; and likewise their important &quot;clan name&quot; is not included in their name. However, members&#x27; names do commonly include second names which &quot;are called surnames&quot; but which are &quot;not&quot; routinely passed down from either father or mother to all their children as a &quot;family name&quot;.

Note well that if a culture did include one&#x27;s &quot;clan name&quot; in one&#x27;s name and routinely handed it down to all children in the &quot;descent group&quot; then it would automatically be the &quot;family name&quot; or &quot;surname&quot; for one&#x27;s descent group (as well as for all other descent groups in one&#x27;s clan).

=== Care of children ===
While a &quot;mother&quot; normally takes care of her own children in all cultures, in some matrilineal cultures an &quot;uncle-father&quot; will take care of his nieces and nephews instead: in other words &quot;social fathers&quot; here are uncles. There is not a necessary connection between the role of father and genitor. In many such matrilineal cultures, especially where residence is also matrilocal, a man will exercise guardianship rights not over the children he fathers but over his sisters&#x27; children, who are viewed as &#x27;his own flesh&#x27;. These children&#x27;s biological father – unlike an uncle who is their mother&#x27;s brother and thus their caregiver – is in some sense a &#x27;stranger&#x27; to them, even when affectionate and emotionally close.

According to Steven Pinker, attributing to Kristen Hawkes, among foraging groups matrilocal societies are less likely to commit female infanticide than are patrilocal societies.

== Matrilineality in specific ethnic groups ==
===Africa ===
==== Akan ====

Some 20 million Akan live in Africa, particularly in Ghana and Ivory Coast. (See as well their subgroups, the Ashanti, also called Asante, Akyem, Bono, Fante, Akwamu.) Many but not all of the Akan still (2001) practice their traditional matrilineal customs, living in their traditional extended family households, as follows. The traditional Akan economic, political and social organization is based on maternal lineages, which are the basis of inheritance and succession. A lineage is defined as all those related by matrilineal descent from a particular ancestress. Several lineages are grouped into a &quot;political unit&quot; headed by a chief and a council of elders, each of whom is the elected head of a lineage – which itself may include multiple extended-family households. Public offices are thus vested in the lineage, as are land tenure and other lineage property. In other words, lineage property is inherited only by matrilineal kin.

&quot;The principles governing inheritance stress sex, generation and age – that is to say, men come before women and seniors before juniors.&quot; When a woman&#x27;s brothers are available, a consideration of generational seniority stipulates that the line of brothers be exhausted before the right to inherit lineage property passes down to the next senior genealogical generation of sisters&#x27; sons. Finally, &quot;it is when all possible male heirs have been exhausted that the females&quot; may inherit.

Each lineage controls the lineage land farmed by its members, functions together in the veneration of its ancestors, supervises marriages of its members, and settles internal disputes among its members.

The political units above are likewise grouped into eight larger groups called &quot;abusua&quot; (similar to clans), named Aduana, Agona, Asakyiri, Asenie, Asona, Bretuo, Ekuona and Oyoko. The members of each &quot;abusua&quot; are united by their belief that they are all descended from the same ancient ancestress. Marriage between members of the same &quot;abusua&quot; is forbidden. One inherits or is a lifelong member of the lineage, the political unit, and the &quot;abusua&quot; of one&#x27;s mother, regardless of one&#x27;s gender and/or marriage. Note that members and their spouses thus belong to different &quot;abusuas&quot;, mother and children living and working in one household and their husband/father living and working in a different household.

According to this source of further information about the Akan, &quot;A man is strongly related to his mother&#x27;s brother (wɔfa) but only weakly related to his father&#x27;s brother. This must be viewed in the context of a polygamous society in which the mother/child bond is likely to be much stronger than the father/child bond. As a result, in inheritance, a man&#x27;s nephew (sister&#x27;s son) will have priority over his own son. Uncle-nephew relationships therefore assume a dominant position.&quot;

Certain other aspects of the Akan culture are determined patrilineally rather than matrilineally. There are 12 patrilineal Ntoro (which means spirit) groups, and everyone belongs to their father&#x27;s Ntoro group but not to his (matrilineal) family lineage and &quot;abusua&quot;. Each patrilineal Ntoro group has its own surnames, taboos, ritual purifications, and etiquette.

A recent (2001) book provides this update on the Akan: Some families are changing from the above &quot;abusua&quot; structure to the nuclear family. Housing, childcare, education, daily work, and elder care etc. are then handled by that individual family rather than by the &quot;abusua&quot; or clan, especially in the city. The above taboo on marriage within one&#x27;s abusua is sometimes ignored, but &quot;clan membership&quot; is still important, with many people still living in the &quot;abusua&quot; framework presented above.

====Guanches====

The Berber inhabitants of Gran Canaria island had developed a matrilineal society by the time the Canary Islands and their people, called Guanches, were conquered by the Spanish.

==== Serer ====

The Serer people of Senegal, the Gambia and Mauritania are patrilineal (&quot;simanGol&quot; in Serer language) as well as matrilineal (&quot;tim&quot;). There are several Serer matriclans and matriarchs. Some of these matriarchs include Fatim Beye (1335) and Ndoye Demba (1367) – matriarchs of the Joos matriclan which also became a dynasty in Waalo (Senegal). Some matriclans or maternal clans form part of Serer medieval and dynastic history, such as the Guelowars. The most revered clans tend to be rather ancient and form part of Serer ancient history. These proto-Serer clans hold great significance in Serer religion and mythology. Some of these proto-Serer matriclans include the &quot;Cegandum&quot; and &quot;Kagaw&quot;, whose historical account is enshrined in Serer religion, mythology and traditions.

In Serer culture, inheritance is both matrilineal and patrilineal. It all depends on the asset being inherited – i.e. whether the asset is a paternal asset – requiring paternal inheritance (&quot;kucarla&quot; ) or a maternal asset – requiring maternal inheritance (&quot;den yaay&quot; or &quot;ƭeen yaay&quot;). The actual handling of these maternal assets (such as jewelry, land, livestock, equipment or furniture, etc.) is discussed in the subsection Role of the Tokoor of one of the above-listed main articles.

==== Tuareg ====
The Tuareg (Arabic:طوارق, sometimes spelled Touareg in French, or Twareg in English) are a large Berber ethnic confederation found across several nations in north Africa, including Niger, Mali and Algeria. The Tuareg are &quot;clan&quot;-based, and are (still, in 2007) &quot;largely matrilineal&quot;. The Tuareg are Muslim, but mixed with a &quot;heavy dose&quot; of their pre-existing beliefs including matrilineality.

Tuareg women enjoy high status within their society, compared with their Arab counterparts and with other Berber tribes: Tuareg social status is transmitted through women, with residence often matrilocal. Most women could read and write, while most men were illiterate, concerning themselves mainly with herding livestock and other male activities. The livestock and other movable property were owned by the women, whereas personal property is owned and inherited regardless of gender. In contrast to most other Muslim cultural groups, men wear veils but women do not. This custom is discussed in more detail in the Tuareg article&#x27;s clothing section, which mentions it may be the protection needed against the blowing sand while traversing the Sahara desert.

===Americas ===
==== Bororo ====

The Bororo people of Brazil and Bolivia live in matrilineal clans, with husbands moving to live with their wives&#x27; extended families.

==== Bribri ====

The clan system of the Bribri people of Costa Rica and Panama is matrilineal; that is, a child&#x27;s clan is determined by the clan his or her mother belongs to. Only women can inherit land.

==== Cabécar ====

The social organization of the Cabécar people of Costa Rica is predicated on matrilineal clans in which the mother is the head of household. Each matrilineal clan controls marriage possibilities, regulates land tenure, and determines property inheritance for its members.

==== Guna ====

In the traditional culture of the Guna people of Panama and Colombia, families are matrilinear and matrilocal, with the groom moving to become part of the bride&#x27;s family. The groom also takes the last name of the bride.

==== Hopi ====

The Hopi (in what is now the Hopi Reservation in northeastern Arizona), according to Alice Schlegel, had as its &quot;gender ideology ... one of female superiority, and it operated within a social actuality of sexual equality.&quot; According to LeBow (based on Schlegel&#x27;s work), in the Hopi, &quot;gender roles ... are egalitarian ... [and] [n]either sex is inferior.&quot; LeBow concluded that Hopi women &quot;participate fully in ... political decision-making.&quot; According to Schlegel, &quot;the Hopi no longer live as they are described here&quot; and &quot;the attitude of female superiority is fading&quot;. Schlegel said the Hopi &quot;were and still are matrilinial&quot; and &quot;the household ... was matrilocal&quot;.

Schlegel explains why there was female superiority as that the Hopi believed in &quot;life as the highest good ... [with] the female principle ... activated in women and in Mother Earth ... as its source&quot; and that the Hopi &quot;were not in a state of continual war with equally matched neighbors&quot; and &quot;had no standing army&quot; so that &quot;the Hopi lacked the spur to masculine superiority&quot; and, within that, as that women were central to institutions of clan and household and predominated &quot;within the economic and social systems (in contrast to male predominance within the political and ceremonial systems)&quot;, the Clan Mother, for example, being empowered to overturn land distribution by men if she felt it was unfair, since there was no &quot;countervailing ... strongly centralized, male-centered political structure&quot;.

==== Iroquois ====

The Iroquois Confederacy or League, combining five to six Native American Haudenosaunee nations or tribes before the U.S. became a nation, operated by The Great Binding Law of Peace, a constitution by which women retained matrilineal-rights and participated in the League&#x27;s political decision-making, including deciding whether to proceed to war, through what may have been a matriarchy or &quot;gyneocracy&quot;. The dates of this constitution&#x27;s operation are unknown: the League was formed in approximately 1000–1450, but the constitution was oral until written in about 1880. The League still exists.

Other Iroquoian-speaking peoples such as the Wyandot and the Meherrin, that were never part of the Iroquois League, nevertheless have traditionally possessed a matrilineal family structure.

==== Kogi ====

The Kogi people of northern Colombia practice bilateral inheritance, with certain rights, names or associations descending matrilineally.

==== Lenape ====

Occupied for 10,000 years by Native Americans, the land that is present-day New Jersey was overseen by clans of the Lenape, who farmed, fished, and hunted upon it. The pattern of their culture was that of a matrilineal agricultural and mobile hunting society that was sustained with fixed, but not permanent, settlements in their &quot;matrilineal clan&quot; territories. Leadership by men was inherited through the maternal line, and the women elders held the power to remove leaders of whom they disapproved.

Villages were established and relocated as the clans farmed new sections of the land when soil fertility lessened and when they moved among their fishing and hunting grounds by seasons. The area was claimed as a part of the Dutch New Netherland province dating from 1614, where active trading in furs took advantage of the natural pass west, but the Lenape prevented permanent settlement beyond what is now Jersey City.

&quot;Early Europeans who first wrote about these Indians found matrilineal social organization to be unfamiliar and perplexing. As a result, the early records are full of &#x27;clues&#x27; about early Lenape society, but were usually written by observers who did not fully understand what they were seeing.&quot;

==== Mandan ====

The Mandan people of the northern Great Plains of the United States historically lived in matrilineal extended family lodges.

==== Naso ====

The Naso (Teribe or Térraba) people of Panama and Costa Rica describe themselves as a matriarchal community, although their monarchy has traditionally been inherited in the male line.

==== Navajo ====

The Navajo people of the American southwest are a matrilineal society in which kinship, children, livestock and family histories are passed down through the female. In marriage the groom moved to live with the brides family. Children also came from their mother&#x27;s clan living in hogans of the females family. 

==== Tanana Athabaskan ====

The Tanana Athabaskan people, the original inhabitants of the Tanana River basin in Alaska and Canada, traditionally lived in matrilineal semi-nomadic bands.

==== Tsenacommacah (Powhatan Confederacy) ====

The Powhatan and other tribes of the Tsenacommacah, also known as the Powhatan Confederacy, practiced a version of male-preference matrilineal seniority, favoring brothers over sisters in the current generation (but allowing sisters to inherit if no brothers remained), but passing to the next generation through the eldest female line. In &quot;A Map of Virginia&quot; John Smith of Jamestown explains:His [Chief Powhatan&#x27;s] kingdome descendeth not to his sonnes nor children: but first to his brethren, whereof he hath 3 namely Opitchapan, Opechancanough, and Catataugh; and after their decease to his sisters. First to the eldest sister, then to the rest: and after them to the heires male and female of the eldest sister; but never to the heires of the males.

==== Upper Kuskokwim ====

The Upper Kuskokwim people are the original inhabitants of the Upper Kuskokwim River basin. They speak an Athabaskan language more closely related to Tanana than to the language of the Lower Kuskokkwim River basin. They were traditionally hunter-gatherers who lived in matrilineal semi-nomadic bands.

==== Wayuu ====

The Wayuu people of Colombia and Venezuela live in matrilineal clans, with paternal relationships in the background.

===Asia ===
==== China ==== 
Originally, Chinese surnames were derived matrilineally, although by the time of the Shang dynasty (1600 to 1046 BCE) they had become patrilineal.

Archaeological data supports the theory that during the Neolithic period (7000 to 2000 BCE) in China, Chinese matrilineal clans evolved into the usual patrilineal families by passing through a transitional patrilineal clan phase. Evidence includes some &quot;richly furnished&quot; tombs for young women in the early Neolithic Yangshao culture, whose multiple other collective burials imply a matrilineal clan culture. Toward the late Neolithic period, when burials were apparently of couples, &quot;a reflection of patriarchy&quot;, an increasing elaboration of presumed chiefs&#x27; burials is reported.

Relatively isolated ethnic minorities such as the Mosuo (Na) in southwestern China are highly matrilineal. 

==== India ====
Of communities recognized in the national Constitution as Scheduled Tribes, &quot;some ... [are] matriarchal and matrilineal&quot; &quot;and thus have been known to be more egalitarian.&quot; Some Hindu communities in Southwest India practiced matrilineality, especially the Nair (or &quot;Nayar&quot;), Tiyyas and some Namboothiri Brahmins in the state of Kerala, and the Bunts and Billava in the state of Karnataka. The system of inheritance was known as Marumakkathayam in the &quot;Nair&quot; community or Aliyasantana in the &quot;Bunt&quot; and the &quot;Billava&quot; community, and both communities were subdivided into clans. This system was exceptional in the sense that it was one of the few traditional systems in India that gave women some liberty and the right to property.

In the matrilineal system of Kerala, southern India, the family lived together in a tharavadu which was composed of a mother, her brothers and younger sisters, and her children in a system called as Marumakkathayam. The oldest male member was known as the Karnavar and was the head of the household, managing the family estate. Lineage was traced through the mother, and the children belonged to the mother&#x27;s family. The surname would be from the maternal side and all family property was jointly owned. In the event of a partition, the shares of the children were clubbed with that of the mother. The Karnavar&#x27;s property was inherited by his sisters&#x27; sons rather than his own sons. Almost all the kingdoms in Kerala practised this system, with the Karnavar of the family becoming the king. The Arakkal kingdom of Kerala followed a similar matrilineal system of descent: the eldest member of the family, whether male or female, became its head and ruler. (For further information see the articles on Nair, Ambalavasi, Bunts and Billava). Amitav Ghosh has stated that, although there were numerous other matrilineal succession systems in communities of the south Indian coast, the Nairs &quot;achieved an unparalleled eminence in the anthropological literature on matrilineality&quot;.

In the northeast Indian state Meghalaya, the Khasi, Garo, Jaintia people have a long tradition of a largely matrilinear system in which the youngest daughter inherits the wealth of the parents and takes over their care.

==== Indonesia ====

In the Minangkabau matrilineal clan culture in Indonesia, a person&#x27;s clan name is important in their marriage and their other cultural-related events. Two totally unrelated people who share the same clan name can never be married because they are considered to be from the same clan mother (unless they come from distant villages). Likewise, when Minangs meet total strangers who share the same clan name, anywhere in Indonesia, they could theoretically expect to feel that they are distant relatives. Minang people do not have a family name or surname; neither is one&#x27;s important clan name included in one&#x27;s name; instead one&#x27;s given name is the only name one has.

The Minangs are one of the world&#x27;s largest matrilineal societies/cultures/ethnic groups, with a population of 4 million in their home province West Sumatra in Indonesia and about 4 million elsewhere, mostly in Indonesia. The Minang people are well known within their country for their tradition of matrilineality and for their &quot;dedication to Islam&quot; – despite Islam being &quot;supposedly patrilineal&quot;. This well-known accommodation, between their traditional complex of customs, called adat, and their religion, was actually worked out to help end the Minangkabau 1821–37 Padri War. 

The Minangkabau are a prime example of a matrilineal culture with female inheritance. With Islamic religious background of complementarianism and places a greater number of men than women in positions of religious and political power. Inheritance and proprietorship pass from mother to daughter. 

Besides Minangkabau, several other ethnics in Indonesia are also matrilineal and have similar culture as the Minangkabau. They are Suku Melayu Bebilang, Suku Kubu and Kerinci people. Suku Melayu Bebilang live in Kota Teluk Kuantan, Kabupaten Kuantan Singingi (also known as Kuansing), Riau. They have similar culture as the Minang. Suku Kubu people live in Jambi and South Sumatera. They are around 200 000 people. Suku Kerinci people mostly live in Kabupaten Kerinci, Jambi. They are around 300 000 people 

====Kurds====
Matrilineality was occasionally practiced by mainstream Sorani, Zaza, Feyli, Gorani, and Alevi Kurds, though the practice was much rarer among non-Alevi Kurmanji-speaking Kurds.

The Mangur clan of the, Culturally, Mokri tribal confederation and, politically, Bolbas Federation is an enatic clan, meaning members of the clan can only inherit their mothers last name and are considered to be a part of the mothers family. The entire Mokri tribe may have also practiced this form of enaticy before the collapse of their emirate and its direct rule from the Iranian or Ottoman state, or perhaps the tradition started because of depopulation in the area due to raids.

==== Malaysia ====

A culture similar to lareh bodi caniago, practiced by the Minangkabau, is the basis for &quot;adat perpatih&quot; practices in the state of Negeri Sembilan and parts of Malacca as a product of West Sumatran migration into the Malay Peninsula in the 15th century.

==== Sri Lanka ====

Matrilineality among the Muslims and Tamils in the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka arrived from Kerala, India via Muslim traders before 1200 CE. Matrilineality here includes kinship and social organization, inheritance and property rights. For example, &quot;the mother&#x27;s dowry property and/or house is passed on to the eldest daughter.&quot; The Sinhalese people are the third ethnic group in eastern Sri Lanka, and have a kinship system which is &quot;intermediate&quot; between that of matrilineality and that of patrilineality, along with &quot;bilateral inheritance&quot;, intermediate between matrilineal and patrilineal inheritance. While the first two groups speak the Tamil language, the third group speaks the Sinhala language. The Tamils largely identify with Hinduism, the Sinhalese being primarily Buddhist. The three groups are about equal in population size.
Patriarchal social structures apply to all of Sri Lanka, but in the Eastern Province are mixed with the matrilineal features summarized in the paragraph above and described more completely in the following subsection:

According to Kanchana N. Ruwanpura, Eastern Sri Lanka &quot;is highly regarded even among&quot; feminist economists &quot;for the relatively favourable position of its women, reflected&quot; in women&#x27;s equal achievements in Human Development Indices &quot;(HDIs) as well as matrilineal and&quot; bilateral &quot;inheritance patterns and property rights&quot;.
She also conversely argues that &quot;&quot;feminist economists&quot; need to be cautious in applauding Sri Lanka&#x27;s gender-based achievements and/or matrilineal communities&quot;, because these matrilineal communities coexist with &quot;&quot;patriarchal&quot; structures and ideologies&quot; and the two &quot;can be strange but ultimately compatible bedfellows&quot;, as follows:

She &quot;positions Sri Lankan women within gradations of &quot;patriarchy&quot; by beginning with a brief overview of the main religious traditions,&quot; Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam, &quot;and the ways in which patriarchal interests are promoted through religious practice&quot; in Eastern Sri Lanka (but without being as repressive as classical patriarchy). Thus, &quot;feminists have claimed that Sri Lankan women are relatively well positioned in the&quot; South Asian region, despite &quot;patriarchal institutional laws that ... are likely to work against the interests of women,&quot; which is a &quot;co-operative conflict&quot; between women and these laws. (Clearly &quot;female-heads have no legal recourse&quot; from these laws which state &quot;patriarchal interests&quot;.) For example, &quot;the economic welfare of female-heads [heads of households] depends upon networks&quot; (&quot;of kin and [matrilineal] community&quot;), &quot;networks that mediate the patriarchal-ideological nexus.&quot; She wrote that &quot;some female heads possessed&quot; &quot;feminist consciousness&quot; and, at the same time, that &quot;in many cases female-heads are not vociferous feminists ... but rather &#x27;victims&#x27; of patriarchal relations and structures that place them in precarious positions... [while] they have held their ground ... [and] provided for their children&quot;.

On the other hand, she also wrote that feminists including Malathi de Alwis and Kumari Jayawardena have criticized a romanticized view of women&#x27;s lives in Sri Lanka put forward by Yalman, and mentioned the Sri Lankan case &quot;where young women raped (usually by a man) are married-off/required to cohabit with the rapists!&quot;

==== Vietnam====
Most ethnic groups classified as &quot;(Montagnards, Malayo-Polynesian and Austroasian)&quot; are matrilineal.

On North Vietnam, according to Alessandra Chiricosta, the legend of Âu Cơ is said to be evidence of &quot;the presence of an original &#x27;matriarchy&#x27; ... and [it] led to the double kinship system, which developed there ... [and which] combined matrilineal and patrilineal patterns of family structure and assigned equal importance to both lines.&quot;

===Australia===
The Arabana people of South Australia are described by Francis Gillen and Walter Baldwin Spencer in their 1899 book The Native Tribes of Central Australia (in which the name is spelled Urabunna) as counting their descent &quot;in the female line&quot;.

The Diyari people of South Australia are described by Francis James Gillen and Walter Baldwin Spencer in their 1899 book The Native Tribes of Central Australia (in which the name is spelled Dieri) as counting their descent &quot;in the female line&quot;.

The Tiwi people living on the Tiwi Islands of Australia&#x27;s Northern Territory base their social structure on matrilineal kinship groups. Traditional marriage practices have persisted in spite of the presence of Christian missionaries on the islands.

===Europe===
====Ancient Greece====
While men held positions of religious and political power, the Spartan constitution mandated that inheritance and proprietorship pass from mother to daughter.

====Ancient Scotland====
In Pictish society, succession in leadership (later kingship) was matrilineal (through the mother&#x27;s side), with the reigning chief succeeded by either his brother or perhaps a nephew but not through patrilineal succession of father to son.

===Oceania ===
Some oceanic societies, such as the Marshallese and the Trobrianders, the Palauans, the Yapese and the Siuai, are characterized by matrilineal descent. The sister&#x27;s sons or the brothers of the decedent are commonly the successors in these societies.

== Matrilineal identification within Judaism ==

Matrilineality in Judaism or matrilineal descent in Judaism is the tracing of Jewish descent through the maternal line. Close to all Jewish communities have followed matrilineal descent from at least early Tannaitic (c. 10–70 CE) times through modern times.

The origins and date-of-origin of matrilineal descent in Judaism are uncertain. Orthodox Judaism maintains that matrilineal descent is an Oral Law from at least the time of the Receiving of the Torah on Mount Sinai (c. 1310 BCE). According to some modern academic opinions, it was likely instituted in either the early Tannaitic period (c. 10–70 CE) or the time of Ezra (c. 460 BCE).

In practice, Jewish denominations define &quot;Who is a Jew?&quot; via descent in different ways. All denominations of Judaism have protocols for conversion for those who are not Jewish by descent.

Orthodox Judaism and Conservative Judaism still practice matrilineal descent. Karaite Judaism, which rejects the Oral Law, generally practices patrilineal descent. Reconstructionist Judaism has recognized Jews of patrilineal descent since 1968.

In 1983, the Central Conference of American Rabbis of Reform Judaism passed a resolution waiving the need for formal conversion for anyone with at least one Jewish parent, provided that either (a) one is raised as a Jew, by Reform standards, or (b) one engages in an appropriate act of public identification, formalizing a practice that had been common in Reform synagogues for at least a generation. This 1983 resolution departed from the Reform Movement&#x27;s previous position requiring formal conversion to Judaism for children without a Jewish mother. However, the closely associated Israel Movement for Reform and Progressive Judaism has rejected this resolution and requires formal conversion for anyone without a Jewish mother.

==Exception for the enslaved in the United States==
In the United States, the offspring of enslaved women inherited their mother&#x27;s status. A significant consequence of this is that children resulting from rape or unions between enslaved women and their owners did not have any of the rights of the father as they would have had under the patrilineal succession that applied to everyone but the enslaved.

== In mythology ==
Certain ancient myths have been argued to expose ancient traces of matrilineal customs that existed before historical records.

The ancient historian Herodotus is cited by Robert Graves in his translations of Greek myths as attesting that the Lycians of their times &quot;still reckoned&quot; by matrilineal descent, or were matrilineal, as were the Carians.

In Greek mythology, while the royal function was a male privilege, power devolution often came through women, and the future king inherited power through marrying the queen heiress. This is illustrated in the Homeric myths where all the noblest men in Greece vie for the hand of Helen (and the throne of Sparta), as well as the Oedipian cycle where Oedipus weds the recently widowed queen at the same time he assumes the Theban kingship.

This trend also is evident in many Celtic myths, such as the (Welsh) mabinogi stories of Culhwch and Olwen, or the (Irish) Ulster Cycle, most notably the key facts to the Cúchulainn cycle that Cúchulainn gets his final secret training with a warrior woman, Scáthach, and becomes the lover of her daughter; and the root of the Táin Bó Cuailnge, that while Ailill may wear the crown of Connacht, it is his wife Medb who is the real power, and she needs to affirm her equality to her husband by owning chattels as great as he does.

The Picts are widely cited as being matrilineal.

A number of other Breton stories also illustrate the motif. Even the King Arthur legends have been interpreted in this light by some. For example, the Round Table, both as a piece of furniture and as concerns the majority of knights belonging to it, was a gift to Arthur from Guinevere&#x27;s father Leodegrance.

Arguments also have been made that matrilineality lay behind various fairy tale plots which may contain the vestiges of folk traditions not recorded.

For instance, the widespread motif of a father who wishes to marry his own daughter—appearing in such tales as &quot;Allerleirauh&quot;, &quot;Donkeyskin&quot;, &quot;The King who Wished to Marry His Daughter&quot;, and &quot;The She-Bear&quot;—has been explained as his wish to prolong his reign, which he would lose after his wife&#x27;s death to his son-in-law. More mildly, the hostility of kings to their daughter&#x27;s suitors is explained by hostility to their successors. In such tales as &quot;The Three May Peaches&quot;, &quot;Jesper Who Herded the Hares&quot;, or &quot;The Griffin&quot;, kings set dangerous tasks in an attempt to prevent the marriage.

Fairy tales with hostility between the mother-in-law and the heroine—such as &quot;Mary&#x27;s Child&quot;, &quot;The Six Swans&quot;, and Perrault&#x27;s Sleeping Beauty—have been held to reflect a transition between a matrilineal society, where a man&#x27;s loyalty was to his mother, and a patrilineal one, where his wife could claim it, although this interpretation is predicated on such a transition being a normal development in societies.

== Matrilineality nation ==
===The Republic of China and the Beginning of Matrilineality===

In the 21st century, when the awareness of gender equality began to develop in various countries, the Republic of China is different from other countries or regions because in the Republic of China, with the massive development of radical feminism in the 1960s [49th year of the Republic of China] and society and religion, it has been developing towards equality between women and men. It has not stopped until 2020 [109th year of the Republic of China]. Today, it has directly changed from patriarchal to matriarchal, becoming the world&#x27;s first It is also the only matriarchal country currently.

<text>In music, metre (British spelling) or meter (American spelling) refers to regularly recurring patterns and accents such as bars and beats. Unlike rhythm, metric onsets are not necessarily sounded, but are nevertheless implied by the performer (or performers) and expected by the listener.

A variety of systems exist throughout the world for organising and playing metrical music, such as the Indian system of &quot;tala&quot; and similar systems in Arabic and African music.

Western music inherited the concept of metre from poetry, where it denotes the number of lines in a verse, the number of syllables in each line, and the arrangement of those syllables as long or short, accented or unaccented. The first coherent system of rhythmic notation in modern Western music was based on rhythmic modes derived from the basic types of metrical unit in the quantitative metre of classical ancient Greek and Latin poetry.

Later music for dances such as the pavane and galliard consisted of musical phrases to accompany a fixed sequence of basic steps with a defined tempo and time signature. The English word &quot;measure&quot;, originally an exact or just amount of time, came to denote either a poetic rhythm, a bar of music, or else an entire melodic verse or dance involving sequences of notes, words, or movements that may last four, eight or sixteen bars.

Metre is related to and distinguished from pulse, rhythm (grouping), and beats:
==Metric structure==
The term &quot;metre&quot; is not very precisely defined. Stewart MacPherson preferred to speak of &quot;time&quot; and &quot;rhythmic shape&quot;, while Imogen Holst preferred &quot;measured rhythm&quot;. However, Justin London has written a book about musical metre, which &quot;involves our initial perception as well as subsequent anticipation of a series of beats that we abstract from the rhythm surface of the music as it unfolds in time&quot;. This &quot;perception&quot; and &quot;abstraction&quot; of rhythmic bar is the foundation of human instinctive musical participation, as when we divide a series of identical clock-ticks into &quot;tick–tock–tick–tock&quot;. &quot;Rhythms of recurrence&quot; arise from the interaction of two levels of motion, the faster providing the pulse and the slower organizing the beats into repetitive groups. In his book &quot;The Rhythms of Tonal Music&quot;, Joel Lester notes that, &quot;[o]nce a metric hierarchy has been established, we, as listeners, will maintain that organization as long as minimal evidence is present&quot;.
&quot;&quot;Meter&quot; may be defined as a regular, recurring pattern of strong and weak beats. This recurring pattern of durations is identified at the beginning of a composition by a meter signature (time signature). ... Although meter is generally indicated by time signatures, it is important to realize that meter is not simply a matter of notation&quot;. A definition of musical metre requires the possibility of identifying a repeating pattern of accented pulses – a &quot;pulse-group&quot; – which corresponds to the foot in poetry. Frequently a pulse-group can be identified by taking the accented beat as the first pulse in the group and counting the pulses until the next accent.

Frequently metres can be subdivided into a pattern of duples and triples. 

For example, a metre consists of three units of a pulse group, and a metre consists of two units of a pulse group. In turn, metric bars may comprise &#x27;metric groups&#x27; - for example, a musical phrase or melody might consist of two bars x .

The level of musical organisation implied by musical metre includes the most elementary levels of musical form. Metrical rhythm, measured rhythm, and free rhythm are general classes of rhythm and may be distinguished in all aspects of temporality:
* Metrical rhythm, by far the most common class in Western music, is where each time value is a multiple or fraction of a fixed unit (beat, see paragraph below), and normal accents reoccur regularly, providing systematic grouping (bars, divisive rhythm).
* Measured rhythm is where each time value is a multiple or fraction of a specified time unit but there are not regularly recurring accents (additive rhythm).
* Free rhythm is where the time values are not based on any fixed unit; since the time values lack a fixed unit, regularly recurring accents are no longer a possibility.
Some music, including chant, has freer rhythm, like the rhythm of prose compared to that of verse. Some music, such as some graphically scored works since the 1950s and non-European music such as Honkyoku repertoire for shakuhachi, may be considered ametric. The music term &quot;senza misura&quot; is Italian for &quot;without metre&quot;, meaning to play without a beat, using time (e.g. seconds elapsed on an ordinary clock) if necessary to determine how long it will take to play the bar.

Metric structure includes metre, tempo, and all rhythmic aspects that produce temporal regularity or structure, against which the foreground details or durational patterns of any piece of music are projected. Metric levels may be distinguished: the beat level is the metric level at which pulses are heard as the basic time unit of the piece. Faster levels are division levels, and slower levels are multiple levels. A rhythmic unit is a durational pattern which occupies a period of time equivalent to a pulse or pulses on an underlying metric level.

==Frequently encountered types of metre==

===Metres classified by the number of beats per measure===
====Duple and quadruple metre====

In duple metre, each measure is divided into two beats, or a multiple thereof (quadruple metre).

For example, in the time signature , each bar contains two (2) quarter-note (4) beats. In the time signature , each bar contains two dotted-quarter-note beats.

Corresponding quadruple metres are , which has four quarter-note beats per measure, and , which has four dotted-quarter-note beats per bar.

====Triple metre====

Triple metre is a metre in which each bar is divided into three beats, or a multiple thereof. For example, in the time signature , each bar contains three (3) quarter-note (4) beats, and with a time signature of , each bar contains three dotted-quarter beats.

==== More than four beats ====
Metres with more than four beats are called &quot;quintuple metres&quot; (5), &quot;sextuple metres&quot; (6), &quot;septuple metres&quot; (7), etc.

In classical music theory it is presumed that only divisions of two or three are perceptually valid, so a metre not divisible by 2 or 3, such as quintuple metre, say , is assumed to either be equivalent to a measure of followed by a measure of , or the opposite: then . Higher metres which &quot;are&quot; divisible by 2 or 3 are considered equivalent to groupings of duple or triple metre measures; thus, , for example, is rarely used because it is considered equivalent to two measures of . See: hypermetre and additive rhythm and divisive rhythm.

Higher metres are used more commonly in analysis, if not performance, of cross-rhythms, as lowest number possible which may be used to count a polyrhythm is the lowest common denominator (LCD) of the two or more metric divisions. For example, much African music is recorded in Western notation as being in , the LCD of 4 and 3.

===Metres classified by the subdivisions of a beat===

Simple metre and compound metre are distinguished by the way the beats are subdivided.

====Simple metre====

Simple metre (or simple time) is a metre in which each beat of the bar divides naturally into two (as opposed to three) equal parts. The top number in the time signature will be 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.

For example, in the time signature , each bar contains three quarter-note beats, and each of those beats divides into two eighth notes, making it a simple metre. More specifically, it is a simple &quot;triple&quot; metre because there are three beats in each measure; simple duple (two beats) or simple quadruple (four) are also common metres.

====Compound metre==== 

Compound metre (or compound time), is a metre in which each beat of the bar divides naturally into three equal parts. That is, each beat contains a triple pulse. The top number in the time signature will be 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 24, etc.

Compound metres are written with a time signature that shows the number of &quot;divisions&quot; of beats in each bar as opposed to the number of beats. For example, compound duple (two beats, each divided into three) is written as a time signature with a numerator of six, for example, . Contrast this with the time signature , which also assigns six eighth notes to each measure, but by convention connotes a simple triple time: 3 quarter-note beats.

Examples of compound metre include (compound duple metre), (compound triple metre), and (compound quadruple metre).

Although and are not to be confused, they use bars of the same length, so it is easy to &quot;slip&quot; between them just by shifting the location of the accents. This interpretational switch has been exploited, for example, by Leonard Bernstein, in the song &quot;America&quot;:
Compound metre divided into three parts could theoretically be transcribed into musically equivalent simple metre using triplets. Likewise, simple metre can be shown in compound through duples. In practice, however, this is rarely done because it disrupts conducting patterns when the tempo changes. When conducting in , conductors typically provide two beats per bar; however, all six beats may be performed when the tempo is very slow.

Compound time is associated with &quot;lilting&quot; and dancelike qualities. Folk dances often use compound time. Many Baroque dances are often in compound time: some gigues, the courante, and sometimes the passepied and the siciliana.

==Metre in song==

The concept of metre in music derives in large part from the poetic metre of song and includes not only the basic rhythm of the foot, pulse-group or figure used but also the rhythmic or formal arrangement of such figures into musical phrases (lines, couplets) and of such phrases into melodies, passages or sections (stanzas, verses) to give what calls &quot;the time pattern of any song&quot;.

Traditional and popular songs may draw heavily upon a limited range of metres, leading to interchangeability of melodies. Early hymnals commonly did not include musical notation but simply texts that could be sung to any tune known by the singers that had a matching metre. For example, The Blind Boys of Alabama rendered the hymn &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; to the setting of The Animals&#x27; version of the folk song &quot;The House of the Rising Sun&quot;. This is possible because the texts share a popular basic four-line (quatrain) verse-form called &quot;ballad metre&quot; or, in hymnals, &quot;common metre&quot;, the four lines having a syllable-count of 8–6–8–6 (Hymns Ancient and Modern Revised), the rhyme-scheme usually following suit: ABAB. There is generally a pause in the melody in a cadence at the end of the shorter lines so that the underlying musical metre is 8–8–8–8 beats, the cadences dividing this musically into two symmetrical &quot;normal&quot; phrases of four bars each.

In some regional music, for example Balkan music (like Bulgarian music, and the Macedonian  metre), a wealth of irregular or compound metres are used. Other terms for this are &quot;additive metre&quot; and &quot;imperfect time&quot;.

==Metre in dance music==

Metre is often essential to any style of dance music, such as the waltz or tango, that has instantly recognizable patterns of beats built upon a characteristic tempo and bar. The Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing defines the tango, for example, as to be danced in time at approximately 66 beats per minute. The basic slow step forwards or backwards, lasting for one beat, is called a &quot;slow&quot;, so that a full &quot;right–left&quot; step is equal to one bar.

But step-figures such as turns, the corte and walk-ins also require &quot;quick&quot; steps of half the duration, each entire figure requiring 3–6 &quot;slow&quot; beats. Such figures may then be &quot;amalgamated&quot; to create a series of movements that may synchronise to an entire musical section or piece. This can be thought of as an equivalent of prosody (see also: prosody (music)).

==Metre in classical music==
In music of the common practice period (about 1600–1900), there are four different families of time signature in common use:
*Simple duple: two or four beats to a bar, each divided by two, the top number being &quot;2&quot; or &quot;4&quot; (, , ... , , ...). When there are four beats to a bar, it is alternatively referred to as &quot;quadruple&quot; time.
*Simple triple: three beats to a bar, each divided by two, the top number being &quot;3&quot; (, , ...)
*Compound duple: two beats to a bar, each divided by three, the top number being &quot;6&quot; (, , ...) Similarly compound quadruple, four beats to a bar, each divided by three, the top number being &quot;12&quot; (, , ...)
*Compound triple: three beats to a bar, each divided by three, the top number being &quot;9&quot; (, , )

If the beat is divided into two the metre is &quot;simple&quot;, if divided into three it is &quot;compound&quot;. If each bar is divided into two it is &quot;duple&quot; and if into three it is &quot;triple&quot;. Some people also label quadruple, while some consider it as two duples. Any other division is considered additively, as a bar of five beats may be broken into duple+triple (12123) or triple+duple (12312) depending on accent. However, in some music, especially at faster tempos, it may be treated as one unit of five.

===Changing metre===

In 20th-century concert music, it became more common to switch metre—the end of Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; (shown below) is an example. This practice is sometimes called &quot;mixed metres&quot;.

A metric modulation is a modulation from one metric unit or metre to another.

The use of asymmetrical rhythms – sometimes called &quot;aksak&quot; rhythm (the Turkish word for &quot;limping&quot;) – also became more common in the 20th century: such metres include quintuple as well as more complex additive metres along the lines of time, where each bar has two 2-beat units and a 3-beat unit with a stress at the beginning of each unit. Similar metres are often used in Bulgarian folk dances and Indian classical music.

==Hypermetre==

Hypermetre is large-scale metre (as opposed to smaller-scale metre). Hypermeasures consist of hyperbeats. &quot;Hypermeter is metre, with all its inherent characteristics, at the level where bars act as beats&quot;. For example, the four-bar hypermeasures are the prototypical structure for country music, in and against which country songs work. In some styles, two- and four-bar hypermetres are common.

The term was coined, together with &quot;hypermeasures&quot;, by Edward T. , who regarded it as applying to a relatively small scale, conceiving of a still larger kind of gestural &quot;rhythm&quot; imparting a sense of &quot;an extended upbeat followed by its downbeat&quot; contends that in terms of multiple and simultaneous levels of metrical &quot;entrainment&quot; (evenly spaced temporal events &quot;that we internalize and come to expect&quot;, p. 9), there is no in-principle distinction between metre and hypermetre; instead, they are the same phenomenon occurring at different levels.

 and Middleton have described musical metre in terms of deep structure, using generative concepts to show how different metres (, , etc.) generate many different surface rhythms. For example, the first phrase of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, excluding the syncopation on &quot;night&quot;, may be generated from its metre of :
The syncopation may then be added, moving &quot;night&quot; forward one eighth note, and the first phrase is generated.

==Polymetre==

With polymetre, the bar sizes differ, but the beat remains constant. Since the beat is the same, the various metres eventually agree. (Four bars of = seven bars of ). An example is the second moment, titled &quot;Scherzo polimetrico&quot;, of Edmund Rubbra&#x27;s Second String Quartet (1951), in which a constant triplet texture holds together overlapping bars of , , and , and barlines rarely coincide in all four instruments.

With polyrhythm, the number of beats varies within a fixed bar length. For example, in a 4:3 polyrhythm, one part plays while the other plays , but the beats are stretched so that three beats of are played in the same time as four beats of . More generally, sometimes rhythms are combined in a way that is neither tactus nor bar preserving—the beat differs and the bar size also differs. See Polytempi.

Research into the perception of polymetre shows that listeners often either extract a composite pattern that is fitted to a metric framework, or focus on one rhythmic stream while treating others as &quot;noise&quot;. This is consistent with the Gestalt psychology tenet that &quot;the figure–ground dichotomy is fundamental to all perception&quot;. In the music, the two metres will meet each other after a specific number of beats. For example, a metre and metre will meet after 12 beats.

In &quot;Toads of the Short Forest&quot; (from the album &quot;Weasels Ripped My Flesh&quot;), composer Frank Zappa explains: &quot;At this very moment on stage we have drummer A playing in , drummer B playing in , the bass playing in , the organ playing in , the tambourine playing in , and the alto sax blowing his nose&quot;. &quot;Touch And Go&quot;, a hit single by The Cars, has polymetric verses, with the drums and bass playing in , while the guitar, synthesizer, and vocals are in (the choruses are entirely in ). Magma uses extensively on (e.g. Mëkanïk Dëstruktïẁ Kömmandöh) and some other combinations. King Crimson&#x27;s albums of the eighties have several songs that use polymetre of various combinations.

Polymetres are a defining characteristic of the music of Meshuggah, whose compositions often feature unconventionally timed rhythm figures cycling over a base.

<doc id="84029" wikidata="Q116980063" url="?curid=84029" title="Euclidean planes in three-dimensional space">
<text>In Euclidean geometry, a plane is a flat two-dimensional surface that extends indefinitely. 
Euclidean planes often arise as subspaces of three-dimensional space formula_1.
A prototypical example is one of a room&#x27;s walls, infinitely extended and assumed infinitesimal thin.
While a pair of real numbers formula_2 suffices to describe points on a plane, the relationship with out-of-plane points requires special consideration for their embedding in the ambient space formula_1.

==Derived concepts==
A &#x27; or &#x27; (or simply &quot;plane&quot;, in lay use) is a planar surface region; it is analogous to a line segment.
A &quot;bivector&quot; is an oriented plane segment, analogous to directed line segments.
A &quot;face&quot; is a plane segment bounding a solid object.
A &quot;slab&quot; is a region bounded by two parallel planes.
A &quot;parallelepiped&quot; is a region bounded by three pairs of parallel planes.

==Background==
Euclid set forth the first great landmark of mathematical thought, an axiomatic treatment of geometry. He selected a small core of undefined terms (called &quot;common notions&quot;) and postulates (or axioms) which he then used to prove various geometrical statements. Although the plane in its modern sense is not directly given a definition anywhere in the &quot;Elements&quot;, it may be thought of as part of the common notions. Euclid never used numbers to measure length, angle, or area. The Euclidean plane equipped with a chosen Cartesian coordinate system is called a &quot;Cartesian plane&quot;; a non-Cartesian Euclidean plane equipped with a polar coordinate system would be called a &quot;polar plane&quot;.


A plane is a ruled surface.

===Euclidean plane===
==Representation==
This section is solely concerned with planes embedded in three dimensions: specifically, in .

===Determination by contained points and lines===
In a Euclidean space of any number of dimensions, a plane is uniquely determined by any of the following:
* Three non-collinear points (points not on a single line).
* A line and a point not on that line.
* Two distinct but intersecting lines.
* Two distinct but parallel lines.

===Properties===
The following statements hold in three-dimensional Euclidean space but not in higher dimensions, though they have higher-dimensional analogues:
* Two distinct planes are either parallel or they intersect in a line.
* A line is either parallel to a plane, intersects it at a single point, or is contained in the plane.
* Two distinct lines perpendicular to the same plane must be parallel to each other.
* Two distinct planes perpendicular to the same line must be parallel to each other.

===Point–normal form and general form of the equation of a plane===
In a manner analogous to the way lines in a two-dimensional space are described using a point-slope form for their equations, planes in a three dimensional space have a natural description using a point in the plane and a vector orthogonal to it (the normal vector) to indicate its &quot;inclination&quot;.

Specifically, let be the position vector of some point , and let be a nonzero vector. The plane determined by the point and the vector consists of those points , with position vector , such that the vector drawn from to is perpendicular to . Recalling that two vectors are perpendicular if and only if their dot product is zero, it follows that the desired plane can be described as the set of all points such that
formula_4
The dot here means a dot (scalar) product.&lt;br&gt;
Expanded this becomes
formula_5
which is the &quot;point–normal&quot; form of the equation of a plane. This is just a linear equation
formula_6
where
formula_7
which is the expanded form of formula_8

In mathematics it is a common convention to express the normal as a unit vector, but the above argument holds for a normal vector of any non-zero length.

Conversely, it is easily shown that if , , , and are constants and , , and are not all zero, then the graph of the equation
formula_6
is a plane having the vector as a normal. This familiar equation for a plane is called the &quot;general form&quot; of the equation of the plane or just the &quot;plane equation&quot;.

Thus for example a regression equation of the form (with ) establishes a best-fit plane in three-dimensional space when there are two explanatory variables.

===Describing a plane with a point and two vectors lying on it===
Alternatively, a plane may be described parametrically as the set of all points of the form
formula_10
where and range over all real numbers, and are given linearly independent vectors defining the plane, and is the vector representing the position of an arbitrary (but fixed) point on the plane. The vectors and can be visualized as vectors starting at and pointing in different directions along the plane. The vectors and can be perpendicular, but cannot be parallel.

===Describing a plane through three points===
Let , , and be non-collinear points.

====Method 1====
The plane passing through , , and can be described as the set of all points (&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;) that satisfy the following determinant equations:
formula_11

====Method 2====
To describe the plane by an equation of the form formula_12, solve the following system of equations:
formula_13
formula_14
formula_15

This system can be solved using Cramer&#x27;s rule and basic matrix manipulations. Let
formula_16

If is non-zero (so for planes not through the origin) the values for , and can be calculated as follows:
formula_17
formula_18
formula_19

These equations are parametric in &quot;d&quot;. Setting &quot;d&quot; equal to any non-zero number and substituting it into these equations will yield one solution set.

====Method 3====
This plane can also be described by the prescription above. A suitable normal vector is given by the cross product
formula_20
and the point can be taken to be any of the given points , or (or any other point in the plane).

==Operations==

===Distance from a point to a plane===
===Line–plane intersection===
===Line of intersection between two planes===
===Sphere–plane intersection===
==Occurrence in nature==

A plane serves as a mathematical model for many physical phenomena, such as specular reflection in a plane mirror or wavefronts in a traveling plane wave.
The free surface of undisturbed liquids tends to be nearly flat (see flatness).
The flattest surface ever manufactured is a quantum-stabilized atom mirror.
In astronomy, various &quot;reference planes&quot; are used to define positions in orbit.
&quot;Anatomical planes&quot; may be lateral (&quot;sagittal&quot;), frontal (&quot;coronal&quot;) or transversal.
In geology, &quot;beds&quot; (layers of sediments) often are planar.
Planes are involved in different forms of imaging, such as the &quot;focal plane&quot;, &quot;picture plane&quot;, and &quot;image plane&quot;. 
=== Miller indices ===
The attitude of a lattice plane is the orientation of the line normal to the plane, and is described by the plane&#x27;s Miller indices. In three-space a family of planes (a series of parallel planes) can be denoted by its Miller indices (&quot;hkl&quot;), so the family of planes has an attitude common to all its constituent planes.

=== Strike and dip ===
Many features observed in geology are planes or lines, and their orientation is commonly referred to as their &quot;attitude&quot;. These attitudes are specified with two angles.

For a line, these angles are called the &quot;trend&quot; and the &quot;plunge&quot;. The trend is the compass direction of the line, and the plunge is the downward angle it makes with a horizontal plane.

For a plane, the two angles are called its &quot;strike (angle)&quot; and its &quot;dip (angle)&quot;. A &quot;strike line&quot; is the intersection of a horizontal plane with the observed planar feature (and therefore a horizontal line), and the strike angle is the &quot;bearing&quot; of this line (that is, relative to geographic north or from magnetic north). The dip is the angle between a horizontal plane and the observed planar feature as observed in a third vertical plane perpendicular to the strike line.

<doc id="84043" wikidata="Q2165643" url="?curid=84043" title="Ronald Howard (British actor)">
<text>Ronald Howard (7 April 191819 December 1997) was an English actor and writer. He appeared as Sherlock Holmes in a weekly television series of the same name in 1954. He was the son of the actor Leslie Howard.

==Early life and education==
Ronald Howard was born on 7 April 1918 in South Norwood, London, the son of actor Leslie Howard and Ruth Evelyn (née Martin). 

He attended Tonbridge School. After graduating from Jesus College, Cambridge, Howard became a newspaper reporter for a while, but then decided to become an actor.

==Film career==
His first movie role was an uncredited bit part in &quot;Pimpernel Smith&quot; (1941), a film directed by and starring his father in the title role, though young Howard&#x27;s part ended up on the cutting room floor. In the early 1940s, Howard gained acting experience in regional theatre, the London stage and eventually films; his official debut was in 1947&#x27;s &quot;While the Sun Shines&quot;. Howard received varying degrees of exposure in some well-known films, such as &quot;The Queen of Spades&quot; (1949) and &quot;The Browning Version&quot; (1951). Howard played Will Scarlet in the episode of the same name of the 1950s British television classic &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; starring Richard Greene. The character of Scarlet was later portrayed by Paul Eddington.

The 1954 &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; television series, based on the Arthur Conan Doyle characters and produced by Sheldon Reynolds, ran for 39 episodes starring Howard as Holmes and Howard Marion-Crawford as Watson. In addition to 21st century DVD releases, in 2006 and 2014 this series was broadcast in the UK on the satellite channel Bonanza, before being repeated in May 2021 on Talking Pictures TV.

Howard continued mainly in British &quot;B&quot; films throughout the 1950s and 1960s, most notably &quot;The Curse of the Mummy&#x27;s Tomb&quot; (1964), along with a few plum television guest roles in British and American television in the 1960s, including the TV series, &quot;Combat!&quot; s.2 ep.25: &quot;What Are the Bugles Blowin&#x27; For?&quot; - Pt.1 &amp; 2 (1964) Wing Commander Hayes in the 1967 &quot;Cowboy in Africa&quot; TV show with Chuck Connors and Tom Nardini; two episodes of Boris Karloff&#x27;s TV series &quot;Thriller&quot;, S1 E23 &quot;Well of Doom&quot; and S2 E5 &quot;God Grante that She Lye Stille&quot; (both 1961). Of his career in British B films the film historians Steve Chibnall and Brian McFarlane wrote, &quot;Despite his blond good looks (and resemblance to his father) and his agreeable demeanour, he lacked genuine star quality.&quot;

Additionally in 1960 he appeared in the television series &quot;Danger Man&quot; in the episode entitled &quot;The Traitor&quot; as Noel Goddard.

In the mid-1970s, he reluctantly put aside his acting career to run an art gallery.

==&quot;In Search of My Father&quot;==
In the 1980s he wrote &quot;In Search of My Father: A Portrait of Leslie Howard&quot;, a biography covering the career and mysterious death of his father, whose plane was shot down over the Bay of Biscay on 1 June 1943. His conclusion (which remains in dispute) was that the Germans&#x27; goal in shooting down the plane was to kill his father, who was Jewish and who had been travelling through Spain and Portugal, ostensibly lecturing on film, but also meeting with local activists and shoring up support for the Allied cause.

The Nazis suspected surreptitious activities since German agents were active throughout Spain and Portugal, which, like Switzerland, was a crossroads for persons from both sides of the conflict, but even more accessible to Allied citizens.

The book explores in detail written German orders to the Ju 88 &quot;Staffel&quot; based in France which was assigned to intercept the aircraft, as well as communiqués on the British side that verify intelligence reports of the time indicating a deliberate attack on Howard. Ronald Howard was convinced that the order to shoot down the airliner came directly from Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi Minister of Propaganda, who had been ridiculed in one of Leslie Howard&#x27;s films, and who believed him to be the most dangerous British propagandist.

==Personal life==
Howard married Patricia Horsman in 1941, which ended in divorce in 1945. He married Jean Millar in 1946.

==Death==
He died on 19 December 1997 in Dorset.

<doc id="84047" wikidata="Q182104" url="?curid=84047" title="Jessica Tandy">
<text>Jessie Alice Tandy (7 June 1909 – 11 September 1994) was a British actress. She appeared in over 100 stage productions and had more than 60 roles in film and TV, receiving an Academy Award, four Tony Awards, a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Primetime Emmy Award. She won a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for playing Blanche DuBois in the original Broadway production of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; in 1948, also winning for &quot;The Gin Game&quot; and &quot;Foxfire&quot;. Her films included &quot;The Birds&quot;, &quot;Cocoon&quot;, &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot;, and &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fool&quot;. At 80, she became the oldest actress to win the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot;.

==Early life==
The youngest of three siblings, Tandy was born in Geldeston Road in Hackney, London, to Harry Tandy and his wife, Jessie Helen Horspool. Her mother was from a large Fenland family in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, and the head of a school for disabled children, and her father was a travelling salesman for a rope manufacturer. She was educated at Dame Alice Owen&#x27;s School in Islington.

Her father died when she was 12, and her mother subsequently taught evening courses to earn an income. Her brother Edward was later a prisoner of war of the Japanese in Asia.

==Career==
Tandy was 18 years old when she made her professional debut on the London stage in 1927. During the 1930s, she acted in many plays in London&#x27;s West End, playing Ophelia (opposite John Gielgud&#x27;s legendary Hamlet) and Katherine (opposite Laurence Olivier&#x27;s Henry V).

She entered films in Britain, but after her marriage to Jack Hawkins failed, she moved to the United States hoping to find better roles. During her time as a leading actress on the stage in London, she often had to fight over roles with her two rivals, Peggy Ashcroft and Celia Johnson. In the following years, she played supporting roles in several Hollywood films. 

Like many stage actors, Tandy also worked in radio. Among other programs, she was a regular on &quot;Mandrake the Magician&quot; (as Princess Narda), and then with her second husband Hume Cronyn in &quot;The Marriage&quot; which ran on radio from 1953 to 1954, and then segued onto television. 

She made her American film debut in &quot;The Seventh Cross&quot; (1944; appearing alongside Cronyn). She had supporting appearances in &quot;The Valley of Decision&quot; (1945), &quot;The Green Years&quot; (1946, as Cronyn&#x27;s daughter), &quot;Dragonwyck&quot; (1946) starring Gene Tierney and Vincent Price and &quot;Forever Amber&quot; (1947). She appeared as the insomniac murderess in &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Vengeance&quot; (1948), a film noir adapted by Aldous Huxley from his short story &quot;The Gioconda Smile&quot;.

Over the next three decades, her film career continued sporadically while she found better roles on the stage. Her roles during this time included &quot;The Desert Fox: The Story of Rommel&quot; (1951) opposite James Mason, &quot;The Light in the Forest&quot; (1958), and a role as a domineering mother in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s film &quot;The Birds&quot; (1963).
On Broadway, she won a Tony Award for her performance as Blanche Dubois in the original Broadway production of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; in 1948. After this (she lost the film role to actress Vivien Leigh), she concentrated on the stage. In 1976, she and Cronyn joined the acting company of the Stratford Festival, and returned in 1980 to debut Cronyn&#x27;s play &quot;Foxfire&quot;. In 1977, she earned her second Tony Award, for her performance (with Cronyn) in &quot;The Gin Game.&quot; The following year the production transferred to London&#x27;s Lyric Theatre, where Tandy was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Actress of the Year in a New Play. Her third Tony came in 1982 for her performance, again with Cronyn, in &quot;Foxfire&quot;.

The beginning of the 1980s saw a resurgence in her film career, with character roles in &quot;The World According to Garp&quot; (with Cronyn), &quot;Best Friends&quot;, &quot;Still of the Night&quot; (all 1982) and &quot;The Bostonians&quot; (1984). She and Cronyn were now working together more regularly on stage and television, including the films &quot;Honky Tonk Freeway&quot; (1981), &quot;Cocoon&quot; (1985), &quot;*batteries not included&quot; (1987), &quot;&quot; (1988), and the Emmy Award winning television film &quot;Foxfire&quot; (1987, recreating her Tony winning Broadway role).

However, it was her colourful performance in &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; (1989), as an aging, stubborn Southern Jewish matron, that earned her an Oscar.

She received a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her work in the grassroots hit &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot; (1991) and co-starred in &quot;The Story Lady&quot; (1991 TV film, with her daughter Tandy Cronyn), &quot;Used People&quot; (1992, as Shirley MacLaine&#x27;s mother), television film &quot;To Dance with the White Dog&quot; (1993, with Cronyn), and &quot;Camilla&quot; (1994, with Cronyn). &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fool&quot; (1994) proved to be her last performance, at the age of 84.

==Personal life and death==

In 1932, Tandy married English actor Jack Hawkins and together they had a daughter, Susan Hawkins. Susan became an actress and was the daughter-in-law of John Moynihan Tettemer, a former Passionist monk who authored &quot;I Was a Monk: The Autobiography of John Tettemer&quot;, and was cast in small roles in &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; and &quot;Meet John Doe&quot;. 

Tandy and Hawkins divorced in 1940. She married Canadian actor Hume Cronyn in 1942. Prior to moving to Connecticut, she and Cronyn lived for many years in nearby Pound Ridge, New York, and they remained together until her death in 1994. They had two children, daughter Tandy Cronyn, an actress who co-starred with her mother in the TV film &quot;The Story Lady&quot;, and son Christopher Cronyn. Tandy became a naturalised citizen of the US in 1952. 

In 1990, Tandy was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, and she also suffered from angina and glaucoma. Despite her illnesses and advancing age she continued working. On September 11, 1994, she died at home in Easton, Connecticut, at the age of 85.

<doc id="84048" wikidata="Q2022317" url="?curid=84048" title="Hounslow">
<text>Hounslow ( ) is a large suburban district of West London, England, west-southwest of Charing Cross. It is the administrative centre of the London Borough of Hounslow, and is identified in the London Plan as one of the 14 metropolitan centres in Greater London.

It is bounded by Isleworth to the east, Twickenham to its south, Feltham to its west and Southall to its north.

The Hounslow post town covers the TW3, TW4, TW5 and TW6 postcodes. Most of the post town is in the London Borough of Hounslow, but parts fall within the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames and the London Borough of Hillingdon, notably including Heathrow Airport.

== History ==

=== Etymology ===
In old records, Hounslow is spelt &#x27;Hundeslow&#x27; which points to the Anglo-Saxon phrase &quot;&#x27;Hundes hlāw&quot;&#x27;, translating to &#x27;the Hound&#x27;s barrow&#x27; or more accurately &#x27;the barrow of a man named or nicknamed Hound&#x27;.

=== Hounslow Town ===
Hounslow was centred around the Holy Trinity Priory founded in 1211. The priory developed what had been a small village into a town with regular markets and other facilities for travellers heading to and from London. Although the priory was dissolved in 1539, the town remained an important staging post on the Bath Road.

The construction of the Great Western Railway line from London to Bristol from 1838 reduced long-distance travel along the Bath Road. By 1842, the local paper was reporting that the &#x27;formerly flourishing village&#x27; (which used to stable 2000 horses) was suffering a &#x27;general depreciation of property&#x27;. The Hounslow Loop Line was constructed in 1850 - which prompted new development. Hounslow Hospital opened in 1876 and closed in 1978. Hanworth Road drill hall (now the Treaty Lodge Hotel) was built for the 2nd Volunteer Battalion, The Middlesex Regiment.

The construction of the Great West Road (a by-pass for the Bath Road, around Brentford, Isleworth and Hounslow town centres) in the 1920s attracted the building of factories and headquarters of large companies and led to a great deal of housing development. After a decline in the 1970s, offices largely replaced factories and further expansion in hotel and housing stock started to take place.

=== Hounslow Heath ===
Hounslow Heath has a continuous recorded history dating back to the Norman period, in which it lent its name to the hamlet of Heathrow. It was infamously known for the numbers of highwaymen and footpads in the area, who targeted wealthy individuals and noblemen.

The Heath once had strategic importance as its routes acted as a throughway from London to the west and southwest of Britain. The present northern boundary of the Heath - Staines Road - was the Roman Road later known as the Devils Highway. There are several historic references to Roman camps surrounding the Heath. Both Oliver Cromwell and James II used the heath as a military encampment.

In 1784 the first accurate measurements were made on the heath to establish the base line for the Ordnance Survey trigonometrical survey of Great Britain. The event was attended by King George IV and Joseph Banks, president of the Royal Society.

In 1793, the Cavalry Barracks were constructed and were extended with the Beavers Lane Camp. Between 1914 and 1920 the heath became Hounslow Heath Aerodrome.

Hounslow Heath Aerodrome was a grass airfield and was operational from 1910 to 1920. It was in the London borough of Hounslow, and in 1919 was where the first scheduled daily international commercial air services began.

== Emergency services ==
The territorial police force is the Metropolitan Police. Hounslow Police Station is located on Montague Road, adjacent to the High Street.

The statutory fire and rescue service in Hounslow is the London Fire Brigade (LFB), with the nearest fire station in Isleworth on London Road.

The nearest accident and emergency hospital is West Middlesex University Hospital, in Isleworth, which is part of the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and a teaching hospital of the Imperial College School of Medicine. London Ambulance Service provides emergency ambulance services.

== Governance ==
Hounslow forms part of the London Borough of Hounslow, governed by Hounslow Council based at Hounslow House at 7 Bath Road. As part of Greater London it is also covered by the London Assembly and Mayor of London for certain strategic functions.

The original settlement of Hounslow grew up on the boundary between the ancient parishes of Heston and Isleworth, both in the Isleworth Hundred of Middlesex. Hounslow was made its own ecclesiastical parish in 1835, whilst continuing to straddle Heston and Isleworth for civil purposes.

In 1875 a local government district was created covering the whole of the two civil parishes, governed by an elected local board. The district was initially divided into three electoral wards: Heston, Hounslow and Isleworth. Such local government districts were converted into urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894.

A referendum of local electors was held in 1927 on whether to change the urban district&#x27;s name from Heston and Isleworth to Hounslow. A significant majority of those who voted supported the change of name (6,778 in favour, 3,775 against), but it was vetoed by Middlesex County Council. The urban district was incorporated to become the Municipal Borough of Heston and Isleworth in 1932.

The borough of Heston and Isleworth was abolished in 1965. Its area was transferred from Middlesex to Greater London and merged with the abolished Municipal Borough of Brentford and Chiswick and Feltham Urban District to become the London Borough of Hounslow.

== Geography ==
Hounslow is separated from Twickenham by Hanworth Road (A314) Nelson Road, Hounslow Road (B361) and Whitton Dene/ Murray Park.

Hall Road, Bridge Road, the Hounslow Loop Line, Thornbury Park, Worton Way, the Piccadilly Line, Stucley Road and Osterley Park separate Hounslow and Isleworth.

The Norwood Green estate and Industrial area in North Hyde, separate Hounslow and Southall whilst the River Crane and Cranford Park form a natural boundary between Hounslow and Hayes

Historically, Hounslow&#x27;s traditional western boundary followed the River Crane; however, it now extends to the Bath Road (A4), Duke of Northumberlands River and Great South-West Road (A30) and back to the river (to include Heathrow Airport).

== Demography ==
The suburban district of Hounslow, including its localities Cranford, Heston, Hounslow West and Lampton, was 103,337 in the 2011 census, whereas the wider borough had a population of 254,000.

Hounslow has a high proportion of people who identify themselves as BAME (Black, Asian and minority Ethnic), and it is the borough&#x27;s most diverse town. In seven of Hounslow&#x27;s eight electoral wards, the BAME proportion is above 70%. The town has a large British Asian and Somali community.

== Economy ==
Hounslow is an economic hub within the west of the capital city, with it having a large shopping centre which adjoins its high street and many restaurants, cafés and small businesses, many of which are associated with product assembly, marketing, telecommunications and Heathrow Airport, which has many businesses and public sector jobs in and around it to which the local population commute. The settlement is also partially employed in the Commuter Belt with access between 45 and 60 minutes from most of Central London.

DHL Air UK has its head office in the Orbital Park in Hounslow.

Hounslow Town Centre is a busy predominantly retail centre, with a small number of commercial offices and civic buildings. There is a large shopping centre called the Treaty Centre which opened in 1987, containing JD, Next, H&amp;M and many large branches of chain stores found in British high streets. It includes a food court along with over 50 shops. There is a large ASDA superstore located within the Blenheim Centre complex (which was completed in 2006) along with B&amp;M, a Barnado&#x27;s charity shop, a local health centre, a gym run by The Gym Group and Jungle V.I.P (a children&#x27;s indoor play area).

A new retail area, the High Street Quarter, will be located near Hounslow High Street and is set to contain a 27-storey residential tower along with many shops, restaurants, and a ten-screen Cineworld cinema multiplex.

== Culture and community ==
Hounslow Heath is a large public open space and local nature reserve to the west of Hounslow, a London borough. It now covers about and is only the residue of the historic Hounslow Heath that once covered over .

Bell Square is an outdoor performance space next to the Bell pub. Hounslow Community Land Project was a community garden and sports area on a derelict piece of land on Hanworth Road.

=== Twinning ===
Hounslow is twinned with the following settlements around the world:

* Issy-les-Moulineaux, France
* Lahore, Pakistan
* Ramallah, Palestine
* Jalandhar, India

The London Borough of Hounslow also has a sister district agreement with Leningradsky District in Krasnodar Krai, Russia.

== Landmarks ==
One of the earliest surviving houses in the town is The Lawn, in front of the former Civic Centre with its public tennis courts, in brown brick with three double-hung sash windows set back in reveals with flat arches, roof with parapet and porch of fluted doric columns, pilasters, entablature and semi-circular traceried fanlight. The similar example of 44–50 Bath Road: also in brown brick and as is sometimes seen, has been painted.

Nearby country houses include Osterley House, Syon House, Hanworth Park House and Worton Hall.

== Transport ==
=== Major roads ===
There are three major roads in Hounslow. The east–west roads, the A4 &#x27;Great West Road&#x27; and the &#x27;Bath Road&#x27; that connects Hounslow to Central London and Slough, and the A30 &#x27;Great South West Road&#x27; that connects it to Staines-upon-Thames, which meet at Henlys Roundabout in Hounslow West. There is also the north–south road, the A312 &#x27;The Causeway&#x27; and &#x27;The Parkway&#x27;, which connects Hounslow to Hampton in the south and Harrow to the north.

Additionally, A and B roads in Hounslow include the A314 &#x27;Hanworth Road&#x27; that starts in Hounslow and finishes in Hanworth, Feltham. The historic A315 &#x27;London Road&#x27;, &#x27;Hounslow High Street&#x27;, &#x27;Hanworth Road&#x27;, &#x27;Grove Road&#x27; and &#x27;Staines Road&#x27;; which starts in Central London and ends in Bedfont, Feltham. In doing this, it connects Hounslow to towns and districts such as Kensington, Hammersmith, Chiswick, Brentford and Isleworth.

===East-west roads===
The A4 Great West Road joins with the A3006 Bath Road (from the A315) before Henlys Roundabout, which is in Hounslow West. From there a WNW route passes Heathrow Airport, terminals 1 to 3 and terminal 5 as the &quot;Bath Road&quot; and a WSW route, the A30, passes terminal 4, bypasses Staines and reaches the M25; the remainder is a mostly-minor route to Land&#x27;s End, Cornwall.

The M4 motorway is two miles north; its nearest junction, J3, being northwest along the A312.

The A315 is the historic WSW road out of London, on which Hounslow&#x27;s High Street is placed. To the east, it bisects Isleworth, Brentford and Chiswick. To the west it bisects North Feltham and Bedfont before joining the A30.

===North-south roads===
The north–south A312, &quot;The Parkway&quot;, to the west of Hounslow leads south to Hampton or north to Harrow passing Waggoners&#x27; Roundabout (WNW of Henlys Roundabout in Hounslow West), Hayes, Yeading and Northolt.

Three minor roads converge on Heston from the A315 in parts of Hounslow, the A3063, A3005 and B363. The single road re-divides just north in Norwood Green into a northwest road to Southall (the A3005) and into the A4127 that passes by Hanwell, briefly using the A4020 west before bypassing Dormers Wells, passing Greenford to reach Sudbury, the town immediately to the west of Wembley and North Wembley.

For longer journeys north, the M4, A4 or A30 then M25 provides the best routes. For longer journeys south, Hanworth Road leads to the A316 that becomes the M3 motorway.

===Trains and Underground===

There are three main London Underground stations in the town; Hounslow East, Hounslow Central and Hounslow West, with all the stations being on the Piccadilly line. The District line used to operate services to Hounslow, and the town also has abandoned stations on the old line, such as Hounslow Town.

Hounslow railway station, operated by South Western Railway, is on the line to London Waterloo, or westwards to Reading, Weybridge, Woking or Windsor. The line also offers services on the Hounslow Loop Line, opened 1850, further around the loop to Twickenham and Richmond. It is situated a fair distance from the town centre and is used far less than the Underground stations.

===Bus services===

Hounslow bus garage and an adjoining bus station are close to the High Street. In 1962, as a result of the final stage of the London trolleybus programme of conversion to motor bus operation, when Isleworth garage was closed, the staff from that depot (coded IH) were transferred to Hounslow. The property is owned by the RATP Group, which took it over with the purchase of London United from Transdev. 

In addition to its frequent and regular daytime services throughout the surrounding areas, Hounslow is served by the N9 night service from Heathrow Airport to Central London.

== Education ==

St Mark&#x27;s Catholic School is on Bath Road. Lampton School was previously Spring Grove Grammar School, in the area of Lampton. Kingsley Academy was formerly known as Hounslow Manor School and Hounslow Heath School, formally known as Hounslow Heath Infant and Nursery School and Hounslow Heath Junior School before they merged, in Selwyn Close.

<doc id="84065" wikidata="Q128799" url="?curid=84065" title="Ricky Martin">
<text>Enrique Martin Morales (born December 24, 1971) is a Puerto Rican singer, songwriter and actor. He is known for his musical versatility, with his discography incorporating a wide variety of many elements, such as Latin pop, dance, reggaeton, salsa, and other genres. Born in San Juan, Martin began appearing in television commercials at age nine and began his musical career at twelve, as a member of Puerto Rican boy band Menudo. He began his solo career in 1991 while in Sony Music Mexico, gaining recognition in Latin America with the release of his first two studio albums, &quot;Ricky Martin&quot; (1991) and &quot;Me Amaras&quot; (1993), both of which were focused on ballads.

Martin&#x27;s third album, &quot;A Medio Vivir&quot; (1995), helped him rise to prominence in European countries. The chart-topping single &quot;María&quot; incorporated a mixture of Latin music genres and became his first international hit. His international success was further solidified with his fourth album, &quot;Vuelve&quot; (1998). The album, which earned Martin his first Grammy Award, spawned songs &quot;Vuelve&quot; and &quot;La Copa de la Vida&quot;. Martin performed the latter at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards. His first English album, &quot;Ricky Martin&quot; (1999) became his first US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 number one. The lead single &quot;Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca&quot; topped both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart. Martin&#x27;s success in the late 1990s is generally seen as the beginning of the &quot;Latin explosion&quot;. He has been credited for propelling the Latin pop music genre to mainstream recognition, paving the way for a large number of Latin artists to achieve global success.

Martin has since released several successful albums, including &quot;Almas del Silencio&quot; (2003) and &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; (2006), as well as Grammy Award winner &quot;A Quien Quiera Escuchar&quot; (2015). Notable singles in this period include &quot;She Bangs&quot;, &quot;Nobody Wants to Be Lonely&quot;, &quot;Tal Vez&quot;, &quot;Tu Recuerdo&quot;, &quot;La Mordidita&quot;, &quot;Vente Pa&#x27; Ca&quot;, and &quot;Canción Bonita&quot;. As an actor, Martin took a role in the hit soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot; (1994–1996), while his portrayal of Antonio D&#x27;Amico in &quot;The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story&quot; (2018) garnered him an Emmy nomination. He also starred as Ché in the Broadway revival of the musical &quot;Evita&quot; in 2012.

Martin is one of the best-selling Latin music artists of all time, having sold over 70 million records worldwide. He has scored 11 &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Songs number-one songs, and won two Grammy Awards, five Latin Grammy Awards, five MTV Video Music Awards, two American Music Awards, three Latin American Music Awards, three &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, nine &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Music Awards, eight World Music Awards, fourteen Lo Nuestro Awards, a &quot;Guinness World Record&quot;, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. His philanthropy and activism focus on LGBT rights and fighting against human trafficking; in 2004, he founded The Ricky Martin Foundation, a non-profit, non-governmental organization that focuses on denouncing human trafficking and educating about the crime&#x27;s existence.

== Early life ==

Enrique Martin Morales was born on December 24, 1971, in San Juan, Puerto Rico. His mother, Doña Nereida Morales, is a former accountant; his father, Enrique Martín Negroni, is a former psychologist who previously worked as a regional supervisor for a Puerto Rican mental-health agency. His parents divorced when he was two years old, and although his mother had custody of Martin, he could also move freely between his father&#x27;s house in the middle-class suburb of University Gardens in San Juan, and his paternal grandmother&#x27;s house nearby. In an interview with &quot;People&quot;, he told the magazine that he &quot;never had to make decisions&quot; about who he loved more, and he was &quot;always happy&quot;. Martin has two older maternal half-brothers, Fernando and Ángel Fernández, two younger paternal half-brothers, Eric and Daniel Martín, and a younger paternal half-sister, Vanessa Martín. Martin has Spanish heritage of Basque and Canarian descent. As he explained to &quot;ABC&quot;, the paternal Martins traveled from Segovia, Spain to Puerto Rico in 1779. He also has some Corsican origins through his paternal grandmother.

Martin grew up Catholic. The people closest to him called him &quot;Kiki&quot; (a nickname that comes from Enrique). He began singing at age six, using wooden kitchen spoons as make-believe microphones; he often sang songs by Puerto Rican boy band Menudo, as well as English-language rock groups such as Led Zeppelin, Journey, and REO Speedwagon. His mother&#x27;s side of the family was musically inclined and his maternal grandfather was a poet. Martin later reflected on his time spent with his family as a child: &quot;Every time I find myself in front of an audience, be it twenty people or one hundred thousand, once again I feel the energy that consumed me back at the family gatherings of my youth.&quot; He attended Colegio Sagrado Corazón, a bilingual Catholic grade school in University Gardens since fourth grade and was an &quot;average&quot; student there. When he was nine years old, he began appearing in television commercials for products such as soft drinks, toothpaste, and fast food restaurants, including Orange Crush and Burger King. In a year and a half, he starred in 11 commercials.

==Career==
=== 1984–1989: Menudo ===
After achieving moderate fame in Puerto Rico for his appearances in television commercials, Martin auditioned for membership in Menudo. Formed in Puerto Rico in 1977, Menudo members were usually replaced when they hit 16 to keep the band &quot;full of fresh-faced members&quot;. Although the executives enjoyed his dancing and singing at his first two auditions, Martin was rejected because he was too short. By the third audition, his persistence impressed executives, and in 1984, 12-year-old Martin became a member. He replaced member Ricky Melendez at Menudo. A month after joining Menudo, he made his debut performance with the group at the Luis A. Ferré Performing Arts Center in San Juan (he had previously sung at a Menudo concert, at Ricky Melendez&#x27;s last concert as a member of the band on September 16, 1984). During this performance, he inadvertently disobeyed the choreography by walking around the stage, when it was planned that he would stay still, and was chastised by the band manager after the show: &quot;The mistake was such a big deal that from that moment on, never again did I move when I wasn&#x27;t supposed to move. That was the discipline of Menudo: You either did things the way you were told or you were not part of the group.&quot; Although Martin enjoyed traveling and performing onstage with Menudo, he found the band&#x27;s busy schedule and strict management exhausting, and later reflected that the experience &quot;cost&quot; him his childhood. Despite this, Martin acknowledged his &quot;opportunity to have so many amazing experiences with so many amazing people&quot; during his time with the group.

During his time with Menudo, he became a &quot;key-member of the group&quot; and a &quot;fan-favorite&quot;, while the band released 11 albums, including the Grammy-nominated &quot;Evolución&quot; () (1984) and their highest-charting and longest-running album on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, &quot;Menudo&quot; (1985). The former featured Martin&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Rayo de Luna&quot; () and the latter included the hit single &quot;Hold Me&quot;. &quot;Hold Me&quot; became the group&#x27;s first and only entry on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, peaking at number 62. It was ranked among the &quot;100 Greatest Boy Band Songs of All Time&quot; by &quot;Billboard&quot;, the &quot;75 Greatest Boy Band Songs of All Time&quot; by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and the &quot;30 Best Boy Band Songs&quot; by &quot;Complex&quot;. Besides the musical career, Martin appeared with other members of Menudo in the American romantic comedy/drama television series, &quot;The Love Boat&quot; (1985), and the Argentine soap opera, &quot;Por Siempre Amigos&quot; (1987). He also developed an interest in philanthropy when the group became UNICEF ambassadors.

Finally, Martin left the band in July 1989, at age 17, hoping to rest and evaluate his career path; he stayed a few extra months after his &quot;age-mandated retirement&quot; came around. He performed his final show with the group at the same venue where he had performed his first performance as a member. Martin returned to Puerto Rico to &quot;get a break from the pressures of the group, the promotional tours, and the constant stress of work.&quot; He graduated from high school, and 13 days after turning 18, he moved to New York City to celebrate his financial independence; since he was a minor during his time with Menudo, Martin was not allowed to access his own bank accounts.

=== 1990–1994: Acting and first solo albums ===
Martin was accepted into New York University&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts in 1990, but before classes began, his friend invited him to Mexico City. He attended the musical comedy play, &quot;Mama Ama el Rock&quot; () there, and was offered to stay and replace one of the actors. He accepted the offer, dropped out of university and moved from New York to Mexico City to perform in the play. While he was performing onstage in &quot;Mama Ama el Rock&quot;, a producer in the audience took notice of Martin&#x27;s acting and offered him a role in the Mexican telenovela &quot;Alcanzar una estrella&quot; () (1990). Martin also joined the cast for the second season of the show, titled &quot;Alcanzar una estrella II&quot; (1991). A film based on the TV series, titled &quot;Más que alcanzar una estrella&quot; () (1992), was also produced in which Martin starred, and earned him an El Heraldo Award for his role.

A Sony Discos executive noticed Martin&#x27;s acting in the soap operas and offered him his first solo music recording contract. Eager to record his first solo album and hustled by the executive, Martin signed the contract without reading its conditions and inadvertently signed a deal in which he would only be paid one cent for each album sold. Despite viewing the contract as unfair, Martin referred to the record as &quot;the start of something phenomenal&quot; for him. After working &quot;around the clock&quot; to finish filming &quot;Alcanzar una estrella II&quot; and recording music, he released his debut solo album, &quot;Ricky Martin&quot;, on November 26, 1991. The album peaked at number five on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Pop Albums chart and spent a total of 41 weeks on the list. It sold over 500,000 copies worldwide, was certified gold in several countries, and spawned his first solo hit singles, &quot;Fuego Contra Fuego&quot; (), &quot;El Amor de Mi Vida&quot; (), and &quot;Dime Que Me Quieres&quot; (). Both &quot;Fuego Contra Fuego&quot; and &quot;El Amor de Mi Vida&quot; reached the top 10 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Tracks. To promote the album, Martin embarked on a successful Latin American tour, breaking box office records, which the singer referred to as &quot;an indescribable feeling, almost like coming home&quot;.

After the success of &quot;Ricky Martin&quot; and its subsequent tour, Martin&#x27;s record company met him with the Spanish musician Juan Carlos Calderón to work on his second studio album, &quot;Me Amaras&quot; () (1993). Although Martin felt &quot;very grateful&quot; for the opportunity to work with Calderón, he noted, &quot;I always felt that that record was more his than mine.&quot; The album sold over one million copies worldwide and was certified triple-platinum in Chile. 

During 1993, Martin suffered two harrowing incidents: he was injured in a car accident and also almost got involved in a plane crash, when a plane that flew him to San Diego, California for an interview, crashed right after dropping him off.

In 1994, Martin&#x27;s agent encouraged him to move to Los Angeles to act in an American sitcom called &quot;Getting By&quot;. The show was canceled after two seasons, but soon afterward, Martin was given the role of Miguel Morez on the popular hit soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;; Morez, a bartender and singer, known for his long and flowing hair, was a Puerto Rican citizen hiding in the United States from his lover&#x27;s criminal mastermind father and created a love triangle with his fiancé Lily Rivera and Brenda. Martin portrayed the role for two years and gained huge popularity and stardom, becoming &quot;one of the most-talked about actors on the soap opera&quot;. Despite this, Martin felt he lacked chemistry with the rest of the &quot;General Hospital&quot; cast and observed that people treated him differently because of his Puerto Rican accent. At the time, it was relatively uncommon for Latin actors to appear on American television, and people suggested that he take accent reduction classes, which he refused.

=== 1995–1997: Breakthrough with &quot;A Medio Vivir&quot; ===

In 1995, Martin refocused on his music career, and began working on his third studio album, &quot;A Medio Vivir&quot; (). The album was released in September 1995, and became a huge success; it sold over three million copies worldwide. being certified gold in the United States, platinum in France, 4× platinum in Spain, as well as many other certifications in Latin American countries. It spawned several successful hits, including &quot;Te Extraño, Te Olvido, Te Amo&quot; (), &quot;María&quot;, and &quot;Volverás&quot; (). On &quot;María&quot;, which was released as the second single from the album, Martin allowed himself &quot;to go into a very Latin, African sound&quot;. He created a mix of different Latin music genres instead of singing a romantic ballad, the style that he focused on it in his first two albums, while Latin pop music in general was mainly made up of it at the time. Although Martin was satisfied with the track and he describes it as a song that he is &quot;extremely proud of&quot;, the first time he played it for a record label executive, the man said: &quot;Are you crazy? You have ruined your career! I can&#x27;t believe you are showing me this. You&#x27;re finished — this is going to be your last album.&quot; Despite this, the track became Martin&#x27;s breakthrough song and his first international hit. It topped the charts in 20 countries, and has sold over five million physical copies worldwide. As a result, the song was featured in the 1999 edition of &quot;The Guinness Book of Records&quot; as the biggest Latin hit.

In Australia, &quot;María&quot; spent six weeks at number one, topped the country&#x27;s year-end chart in 1998, and was certified platinum. The song also spent nine weeks at number one in France, and was certified diamond, selling over 1.4 million copies there. Additionally, the track reached the top 10 in the United Kingdom, and became Martin&#x27;s first entry on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. To promote &quot;A Medio Vivir&quot;, he embarked on the worldwide A Medio Vivir Tour, that lasted for more than two years, through which he performed 63 shows and visited Europe, Latin America and the United States. During an interview with &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; in 1996, Martin expressed an interest in performing on Broadway. In a few days, he received a phone call from producer Richard Jay-Alexander, and was offered the role of Marius Pontmercy in the play &quot;Les Misérables&quot;. After the conclusion of the A Medio Vivir Tour in Latin America, Martin returned to New York to appear in the play in an eleven-week run. He greatly enjoyed the experience, calling his time in the play an &quot;honor&quot; and &quot;the role of [his] life&quot;. Martin continued to tour after the conclusion of the show&#x27;s run, and noted that his audiences were growing in both size and enthusiasm.

=== 1998–1999: &quot;Vuelve&quot; ===
While the A Medio Vivir Tour had not been concluded yet, Martin returned to the studio to record his fourth album &quot;Vuelve&quot; (). He called the experience of touring and recording at the same time &quot;brutal and incredibly intense&quot;. As he was finishing the record in 1997, &quot;María&quot; caught the attention of FIFA. They contacted Martin and asked him to create a song as the 1998 FIFA World Cup anthem. He stated about the request: &quot;I have to admit that the challenge made me a bit nervous, but the massive growth potential for my career was such that I decided to accept.&quot; Following his acceptance, musicians K.C. Porter, Robi Rosa, and Desmond Child joined him and they started working on a song titled &quot;La Copa de la Vida&quot; (English: &quot;The Cup of Life&quot;). Martin wrote about the recording:

&quot;La Copa de la Vida&quot; was included on &quot;Vuelve&quot;, released February 12, 1998. The album became a huge success; it sold over eight million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling Spanish-language album in history, according to his label. Also, some sources have reported the album&#x27;s sales as six million copies worldwide. It spent 26 weeks atop the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Latin Albums chart and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In Canada, the album peaked at number three and was certified double platinum. &quot;Vuelve&quot; spawned big hits, including the title track, &quot;La Copa de la Vida&quot;, &quot;Perdido Sin Ti&quot; (), and &quot;La Bomba&quot; (). &quot;La Copa de la Vida&quot; grew to be an international success, appearing on the charts in more than 60 countries, and reaching number one in 30 countries, Both &quot;Vuelve&quot; and &quot;Perdido Sin Ti&quot; peaked at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Tracks chart; the former also reached number one in eight countries. On July 12, 1998, Martin performed &quot;La Copa de la Vida&quot; as the official anthem at the 1998 FIFA World Cup Final in France, in front of more than a billion TV viewers around the world.

To promote &quot;Vuelve&quot;, Martin embarked on the worldwide Vuelve Tour; he performed in Asia, Australia, Europe, Mexico, South America, and the United States. Although Latin music was not important to the Recording Academy or the mainstream music industry at the time, Tommy Mottola, then-chief of Columbia Records, was certain about Martin&#x27;s stardom and pushed hard to have him on the Grammy Awards ceremony. Finally, on February 24, 1999, cavorting with a 15-piece band alongside and a large number of dancers and percussionists, Martin performed a bilingual version of &quot;La Copa de La Vida&quot; at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards, which was greeted with a standing ovation and met with acclaim from music critics. At the same night, &quot;Vuelve&quot; earned Martin his first Grammy award, for Best Latin Pop Performance.

===1999–2000: Crossover to English===

In October 1998, CNN confirmed that Martin has been working on his first English language album, following the huge success of &quot;Vuelve&quot;. The album was titled &quot;Ricky Martin&quot; and was released on May 11, 1999, two weeks ahead of schedule, because of the huge interest in the disc, following Martin&#x27;s performance at the Grammy Awards. Tim Devin, the general manager of Tower Records stated about Martin: &quot;He&#x27;s always been one of our strongest Latin artists, but interest in him has picked up considerably since that performance.&quot; &quot;Ricky Martin&quot; debuted atop the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 661,000 copies, becoming the largest sales week by any album in 1999. It also broke the record as the largest first-week sales for any pop or Latin artist in history, as well as any Columbia Records artist during the SoundScan era. With this album, Martin became the first male Latin act in history to debut at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. It was certified 7× platinum by RIAA, denoting shipments of over seven million copies in the US and breaking the record as the best-selling album by a Latin artist in the country.

The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca&quot; () topped the charts in more than 20 countries and is considered to be Martin&#x27;s biggest hit, and one of the best-selling singles of all time.

Additionally, it broke several records on &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. It also spent eight consecutive weeks atop the Canada Top Singles chart and topped the country&#x27;s year-end chart.

In February 2001, Martin released a Spanish compilation album entitled &quot;La Historia&quot; (), which spent five weeks at number one on the Top Latin Albums chart, topped the charts in Argentina and Sweden, and was certified quadruple Latin platinum in the United States. Later that year it was also announced that he would star in a remake of Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; alongside Jennifer Lopez, but this did not eventuate.
Following the success of &quot;Ricky Martin&quot; and &quot;Sound Loaded&quot;, he initially planned to release the third English-language album as his seventh studio album, which was supposed to be his first complete work in the field of songwriting. Despite Sony Music Entertainment&#x27;s original plan after a two-year hiatus he decided to release a Spanish-language album: &quot;I woke up five months ago, and I said &#x27;We&#x27;re doing an album in Spanish.&#x27; Everyone went nuts. They said, &#x27;You don&#x27;t have time; you have to release an album in English because of timing issues with your career.&#x27; And that&#x27;s fine. But I told them, &#x27;In five months, you&#x27;ll have a kick-ass album&#x27; [in Spanish]. Martin&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;Almas del Silencio&quot; () was released in May 2003. It debuted atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Latin Albums chart with first-week sales of 65,000 copies, according to data compiled by Nielsen SoundScan, breaking the record as the largest first-week sales for a Spanish-language album in the US.

&quot;Almas del Silencio&quot; spawned three Hot Latin Tracks chart-topper hits: &quot;Tal Vez&quot; (), &quot;Jaleo&quot;, and &quot;Y Todo Queda en Nada&quot; (). &quot;Tal Vez&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Tracks chart on the week of April 12, 2003, marking the first number one debut since February 1998, and becoming the sixth song overall in the chart&#x27;s history to do so. It spent a total of 11 weeks at this position, surpassing &quot;Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca&quot; as Martin&#x27;s longest number-one single on the chart, and was the longest-running number one of 2003. It also topped the charts in several Latin American markets. In October 2005, Martin released his third English album, &quot;Life&quot;. He commented on the album: &quot;I was really in touch with my emotions. I think this album is very multi-layered, just like life is. It&#x27;s about feeling anger. It&#x27;s about feeling joy. It&#x27;s about feeling uncertainty. It&#x27;s about feeling. And all my emotions are part of this production&quot;. To promote &quot;Life&quot;, Martin embarked on the worldwide One Night Only with Ricky Martin tour.

===2006–2012: &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;, &quot;Música + Alma + Sexo&quot;, and &quot;Evita&quot;===

== Artistry ==
=== Influences ===

As a child, Martin used to sing songs by Menudo and rock bands such as Led Zeppelin, Journey, and REO Speedwagon, which were what his &quot;older siblings were listening to at the time&quot;. While Martin and his brothers spent their time listening to classic rock, their mother would interrupt them to make them listen to Latin music. She brought him CDs of Fania All-Stars, Celia Cruz, El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico, and Gilberto Santa Rosa that slowly made him appreciate the richness of Puerto Rican culture. Also, she once took them to a Fania All-Stars concert, which Martin is &quot;beyond grateful&quot; for. He expresses that thanks to her mother, those influences had a &quot;profound effect&quot; on his musical career. Martin has also cited Elvis Presley, the Beatles, Michael Jackson, and Madonna for teaching him &quot;the beauty of pop&quot;. He stated about Madonna: &quot;I was very influenced by her and her music. I know every choreography of Madonna.&quot; Additionally, he mentions Carlos Santana, José Feliciano, Celia Cruz, and Gloria Estefan as the artists who paved the way for him, naming Feliciano as one of the people who inspired him when he was a teenager: &quot;I was always fascinated with his music.&quot; In addition to the musical influences, Martin is inspired by David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;ambiguous sexuality&quot;. While growing up, he used to ask himself if he wanted to be like the openly gay singer Elton John or he just liked him, admiring his music, colors, and wigs. He has also cited Barbra Streisand as an entertainer he wants to be like: &quot;I want to be an entertainer, not just a singer.&quot;

Considered to be a versatile artist, Martin describes his music as Latin pop, saying: &quot;When you say &#x27;Latin pop&#x27;, the spectrum is so broad, It&#x27;s inevitable to not be influenced by everything that&#x27;s happening in the industry, but always keeping your identity firm by knowing who you are.&quot; He has also described his music as fusion, while noting that he does not &quot;ride the waves that are in fashion at the moment&quot;. Martin sings in Spanish, English, Portuguese, Italian, and French. About his lyrics, Martin has emphasized that although his music will always make the listener dance, it does not mean his lyrics &quot;have to be meaningless&quot; and he sings about love and heartbreak, as well as &quot;things that are good for a society&quot;, such as &quot;freedom, freedom of expression, and social justice&quot;. He has also declared that as a Latino, he is not afraid of sexuality and sings about sexuality and sensuality, bringing his culture with him onstage.

=== Voice ===
Martin possesses a dramatic tenor vocal range. Peter Gilstrap from &quot;Variety&quot; commented that his &quot;powerful voice&quot; is &quot;capable of belt or lilt&quot;, while &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;″s Noa Amouyal described his voice as &quot;soulful&quot; and &quot;very powerful&quot;. In 1995, Enrique Lopetegui of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted Martin&#x27;s &quot;improved vocal skills&quot; on &quot;A Medio Vivir&quot;. Also from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Ernesto Lechner later praised his vocal for being &quot;charismatic enough to handle both ballads and up-tempo tunes&quot;. Similarly, &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Chuck Taylor expressed &quot;She&#x27;s All I Ever Had&quot; boasts &quot;a versatility that contrasts nicely&quot; with Martin&#x27;s previous single, &quot;Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca&quot;, labeling his vocal on the former &quot;tender and heartfelt&quot;. Steve Gerrard of the &quot;Montreal Rocks&quot; complimented &quot;his vocal maturity&quot; on &quot;A Quien Quiera Escuchar&quot;.

=== Music videos ===
&quot;Billboard&quot; labeled Martin &quot;a video icon&quot;, and ranked him as the 79th Greatest Music Video Artist of All Time in 2020, stating: &quot;From the moment he sashayed up to the mic in &#x27;Livin La Vida Loca&#x27; all dressed in black, and gave us that look, the Menudo alum became the most memorable and watchable drop-dead handsome guy in pop music.&quot; He has collaborated with various directors to produce his music videos, including Carlos Perez, Wayne Isham, Jessy Terrero, Simón Brand, Gustavo Garzón, Nigel Dick, Kacho Lopez, and Memo del Bosque. &quot;Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca&quot; was nominated for Video of the Year at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards, making Martin the first Latin artist in history to receive a nomination in this category. It won a total of five awards at the ceremony, making it rank among the videos with most wins in the history of the MTV Video Music Awards. The explicit sexual scenes of the music video for &quot;She Bangs&quot; were met with criticism from the audience; several American television stations cut the scenes when airing the video. According to the &quot;Daily Record&quot;&#x27;s John Dingwall, with the visual, Martin ditched his teen idol image by transforming to a more mature one. It was consequently banned in several Latin American countries, such as the Dominican Republic. Martin told MTV News that the video represented freedom rather than his sexuality. The video was awarded Best Music Video at the 2nd Annual Latin Grammy Awards, Best Clip of the Year – Latin at the 2001 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Video Awards, and Video of the Year at the 13th Lo Nuestro Awards.

==Public image==
Martin became a teen idol with his debut as a member of Menudo, and a pop icon following global fame as a solo artist. &quot;Metro Puerto Rico&quot; stated that he &quot;raised the name of Puerto Rico internationally&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; described him as &quot;Puerto Rico&#x27;s arguably most famous son&quot; in 2021. He is ranked as the most famous Latin music artist in the United States, according to YouGov surveys in 2023.

During the 2000s, Martin was known for &quot;guarding his private life&quot; and being &quot;uncomfortable discussing intimate aspects of his personal life&quot;; he used to insist on asking public to focus on his music and &quot;steered interviewers away from his personal life&quot;. However, he chose to live both his &quot;professional and personal life&quot;, making his private life public since the early 2010s. In 2021, he went on the cover of &quot;People&quot; with the title &quot;No More Secrets&quot; and told the magazine that he is &quot;a man with no secrets&quot;, stating that he is &quot;more comfortable in his own skin than ever before&quot;.

Martin is considered to be a sex symbol. 

==Personal life==
===Sexual orientation and early relationships===
In his early life, Martin had relationships with both men and women. In 2000, American broadcast journalist Barbara Walters asked Martin about his sexuality on national television: &quot;You could stop these rumors. You could say, &#x27;Yes I am gay or no I&#x27;m not. Martin, who answered with &quot;I just don&#x27;t feel like it&quot; at the time, later revealed that her question had made him feel &quot;violated&quot;, since he &quot;was just not ready to come out&quot; and was &quot;very afraid&quot;; he said that it resulted in &quot;a little fake PTSD&quot; that &quot;still haunts him&quot;.

In August 2008, Martin became a father to twin boys named Matteo and Valentino, born via gestational surrogacy. He explained that he chose surrogacy to become a parent for being &quot;intriguing and faster&quot; than adoption, which was complicated and could take a long time. In March 2010, Martin publicly came out as gay via a message on his website, stating: &quot;I am proud to say that I am a fortunate homosexual man. I am very blessed to be who I am.&quot; In an interview with &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, he declared: &quot;There was love, passion. I do not regret anything, any of the relationships I lived, they taught me a lot, both men and women.&quot; Martin also told &quot;Fama!&quot;: &quot;I know that I like both men and women, I&#x27;m against sexual labels, we are simply human beings with emotional and sexual needs. I like to enjoy sex in total freedom, so I&#x27;m open to having sex with a woman if I feel desire.&quot; Despite this, he expressed that he would not be interested in &quot;an ongoing relationship with a woman&quot;, stating: &quot;Men are my thing&quot;. Martin dated Puerto Rican economist Carlos González Abella from 2010 to 2014, as his first relationship with a man after coming out as gay.

===Marriage===

Syrian-Swedish painter Jwan Yosef shared a photo of himself and Martin on Instagram on March 30, 2016, with the caption: &quot;Obviously we&#x27;re starting a band.&quot; In January 2018, Martin confirmed that he had secretly married Yosef: &quot;I&#x27;m a husband...&quot; On December 31, 2018, they announced that they had welcomed their first daughter together, named Lucia Martin-Yosef. In September 2019, while accepting an award at the 23rd annual Human Rights Campaign (HRC) National Dinner, he announced that they were expecting their fourth child. On October 29, 2019, he shared a photo of himself, Yosef, and their newborn son, named Renn Martin-Yosef, with the caption: &quot;Our son Renn Martin-Yosef has been born.&quot; In July 2023, Martin and Yosef announced they had separated and were divorcing after six years of marriage.

===Beliefs and religion===
During an interview with &quot;People&quot; in 2002, Martin expressed that he believes in &quot;love&quot;, &quot;the power of healing&quot;, and &quot;God&quot;, thanks to his parents. The name he chose for his son Matteo means &quot;gift from God&quot;. According to his statements in a 2021 interview, he still believes in God. He was raised Catholic but he said is not &quot;the person who would ever look down upon one religion&quot;. He expressed that he also admires and likes Buddhist philosophy.

===Real estate===
In March 2001, Martin purchased a house in Miami Beach for $6.4 million; he sold the unit for $10.6 million in 2005. In September 2004, he paid $11.9 million for an 11,000-square-foot Mediterranean-style villa in Los Angeles, which he sold in 2006 for $15 million. In May 2005, he purchased a 9,491-square-foot house in Miami Beach for $10 million; he sold the villa for $10.6 million in 2012. In 2007, he paid $16.2 million for a mansion in Golden Beach. He sold the property in 2012 for $12.8 million, incurring a loss. In the same year, he bought a 3,147-square-foot condominium in New York City for $5.9 million; he sold the condo for $7.1 million in 2017. In 2014, he rented a 900-square-metre mansion in Sydney, which became famous as &quot;the Bronte Wave House&quot; and was sold for $16 million in May 2015, marking one of the most expensive properties sold in the city that year. In December 2016, he purchased an 11,300-square-foot mansion in Beverly Hills. The estate, which is Martin&#x27;s current house, has seven bedrooms and eight bathrooms with outdoor seating areas scattered throughout 33,000 square feet. It is a &quot;private getaway in the middle of the city&quot;, located up the street from the Beverly Hills Hotel. Martin also owns a property in Puerto Rico and a private 19.7-acre island in Brazil. He purchased the latter for $8 million in 2008. In 2022, &quot;La Nación&quot; estimated his net worth at US$130 million.

==Influence==
Martin has been called the &quot;King of Latin Pop&quot; by various publications.

Martin&#x27;s song &quot;María (Pablo Flores Remix)&quot;, which was ranked among the &quot;Greatest Latin Pop Songs of All Time&quot; by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and &quot;11 remixes of classic Latin hits&quot; by &quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;launched the Latin and dance music crossover of the &#x27;90s&quot;, according to the latter. Olivier Pérou from &quot;Le Point&quot; commented that &quot;some have even learned, thanks to him, to count to three in Spanish&quot; following the popularity of the song. &quot;La Copa de la Vida&quot;, which has been hailed as the Best World Cup Anthem of All-Time by multiple sources, became a &quot;musical template&quot; for World Cup anthems, and Martin&#x27;s Latin and dance crossover style has been much copied in the anthems, as well as soccer chant &quot;Ole! Ole! Ole!&quot; in the lyrics, according to &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;.

Martin is known as the pioneer in getting Latin pop music genre to mainstream recognition. Following his performance of &quot;The Cup of Life&quot; at the Grammys, and the success of &quot;Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca&quot; and &quot;Ricky Martin&quot; (1999), he opened the gates for many Latin artists such as Jennifer Lopez, Shakira, Christina Aguilera, Marc Anthony, Santana, and Enrique Iglesias who released their crossover albums and followed him onto the top of the charts. His performance of &quot;The Cup of Life&quot; at the Grammys not only changed the course of his career, but also altered how people regard Latin music in America. It has been known as a game-changer for Latin music worldwide, that effectively ushered in the &quot;Latin explosion&quot;. Then-United Talent Agency head Rob Prinz described the rendition as &quot;the single biggest game changing moment for any artist in the history of the Grammys&quot;. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, it has been cited as the beginning of the &quot;Latin Pop invasion&quot;, which powerfully affected the US mainstream. According to &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;, &quot;Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca&quot; paved the way for a large number of other Latin artists, and is &quot;credited as the song that helped other Latin artists break through to English-speaking markets&quot;. According to &quot;The Independent&quot;, the single is &quot;widely regarded as the song that began the first Latin pop explosion.&quot;

===Portrayal in television===

In July 2019, SOMOS Productions, Endemol Shine Boomdog, and Piñolywood Studios announced the production of a biographical web television series about Menudo, titled &quot;Subete a Mi Moto&quot;. Consisting of 15 episodes of 60 minutes each, the series premiered on Amazon Prime Video on October 9, 2020, in Mexico, Latin America, and Spain. It was filmed in Mexico and Puerto Rico, and Martin was portrayed by actors Felipe Albors and Ethan Schwartz. The series premiered in the United States on February 14, 2021, on Estrella TV. On the review aggregation website Tomatazos, the first season has a positive score of 75%. The website&#x27;s critical consensus summary states, &quot;A good trip to the past that recalls a band that defined the youth of a certain public, but that doesn&#x27;t ignore the darkest moments in the lives of its members.&quot;

==Books==
On August 19, 2010, Martin announced that he had been working on his memoir, mentioning its title as &quot;Me&quot; and publish date as November 2, 2010. He expressed that writing the book was &quot;one of the reasons&quot; he decided to come out earlier that year. The book also had a Spanish edition title &quot;Yo&quot; (), which was published simultaneously by Celebra. &quot;Me&quot; spent several weeks at number one on the New York Times Best Seller list. Martin&#x27;s first children&#x27;s book &quot;Santiago the Dreamer in Land Among the Stars&quot; was published by Celebra and illustrated by Patricia Castelao in November 2013 for ages between five and nine. Its Spanish-language edition, &quot;Santiago El Soñador en Entre Las Estrellas&quot;, was published simultaneously. Martin expressed that the book was inspired by his &quot;personal life, with fantasy added to it&quot;, as well as &quot;a lot of cartoons&quot;.

== Activism ==
=== Philanthropy ===

In 2004, Martin launched the Ricky Martin Foundation, a non-profit, non-governmental organization that focuses on human trafficking. In January 2005, following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, Martin visited Thailand to assess the needs of the minor survivors who were &quot;extremely vulnerable to traffickers&quot;. Later that year, the Ricky Martin Foundation signed an alliance in partnership with Habitat for Humanity to construct 224 homes for the tsunami-affected families. The project was completed in December 2006. In March 2006, the foundation collaborated with the International Organization for Migration in the Llama y Vive () campaign, which focuses on facilitating &quot;the prevention of human trafficking and the protection of young people, victims of child trafficking and prosecution of traffickers&quot;. In 2012, the foundation participated in the making of the Child Protection Model Law on the International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children.

=== Politics ===

On January 20, 2001, during the first inauguration of George W. Bush, Martin performed &quot;The Cup of Life&quot; and danced with him. Martin&#x27;s view of Bush changed over the Iraq War, as expressed in his declaration to BBC News that he will &quot;always condemn war and those who promulgate it&quot;. At the 2010 &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Music Awards, Martin expressed his disagreement with the Arizona SB 1070 bill, a proposed law that would have required police officers to request documents from individuals whom they suspected to be illegal immigrants. Martin has supported Democratic presidential candidates Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Joe Biden. In May 2021, Martin demonstrated his support for the Ni una menos movement, condemning femicides and violence against women in Puerto Rico, while calling authorities to protect women.

In October 2024, Martin endorsed Kamala Harris for president after a rally held by former U.S. president Donald Trump at Madison Square Garden, in which comedian Tony Hinchcliffe compared Puerto Rico to a &quot;floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean&quot;.

=== LGBT advocacy ===

As a gay man, Martin actively supports LGBT rights worldwide since his coming out in 2010. Even before coming out, he was noted by the mainstream media for being popular among gay men and having a large gay fan base. He also went on the cover of the American LGBTQ-interest magazine &quot;The Advocate&quot; in July 1999. Despite this, he admitted that he felt homosexuality was evil since he was raised as a Catholic and targeted his anger toward others, especially gay men: &quot;I was very angry, very rebellious. I used to look at gay men and think, &#x27;I&#x27;m not like that, I don&#x27;t want to be like that, that&#x27;s not me.&#x27; I was ashamed.&quot; He added that he &quot;had internalized homophobia&quot; back then. He is currently considered to be a gay icon, with &quot;PinkNews&quot; labeling him &quot;a strong advocate of LGBT rights&quot; who &quot;expressed support for equal marriage&quot; since coming out.

As the first mainstream Latin music artist to come out, Martin&#x27;s coming out was a game-changer for &quot;Latin Pride&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Lucas Villa stated: &quot;With Martin&#x27;s announcement, gay artists, who had long kept their sexual identities a secret, finally had a beacon of hope. If Martin could come out with his career unscathed, there was hope for other artists in Latin music to start doing the same.&quot; He added that since then, &quot;a growing number of Latin artists have either come out after years in the spotlight, or many have simply started their careers by embracing their gay identities&quot;. Suzy Exposito from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; argued that with risking his career and coming out, Martin &quot;set the scene for Bad Bunny to be free in many ways that, during his own breakthrough moment, he could not&quot;.

In June 2019, he published an open letter slamming a religious liberty bill, saying: &quot;As a defender of human rights and a member of the LGBTT community, I am vehemently opposed to the proposed measure imposed upon us under the guise of religious freedom, that projects us to the world as a backwards country.&quot; Puerto Rico&#x27;s then-governor backed down and withdrew his support of the bill following Martin&#x27;s statement.

Several of Martin&#x27;s music videos feature diversity in sexual orientations and same-sex couples, including &quot;The Best Thing About Me Is You&quot;, &quot;Disparo al Corazón&quot;, &quot;Fiebre&quot;, and &quot;Tiburones&quot;. For his activism and advocacy for LGBTQ community, Martin has been honored with numerous accolades, including the GLAAD Vito Russo Award, the Gala Vanguard Award by the Los Angeles LGBT Center, the International Icon Award by the British LGBT Awards, the National Visibility Award by the Human Rights Campaign, the Trailblazer Award by the LGBT Center Dinner, the Celebrity Activist of the Year by &quot;LGBTQ Nation&quot;, and the Legacy Award by &quot;Attitude&quot; Awards.

==Recognition==

Throughout his career, Martin has won over 200 awards (most awarded male Latin artist), including two Grammy Awards, five Latin Grammy Awards, five MTV Video Music Awards (tied for most wins by a Latin artist), two American Music Awards, three Latin American Music Awards, three &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, a &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Video Award, nine &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Music Awards, eight World Music Awards, fourteen Lo Nuestro Awards (including the Excellence Award), and a &quot;Guinness World Record&quot;. As an actor, he was nominated for an Emmy Award. In 2007, Martin was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, located at 6901 Hollywood Blvd.

On October 11, 2007, then-mayor of Miami Beach, Florida David Dermer awarded him the key to the city of Miami Beach. Puerto Rico named August 31 the &quot;International Ricky Martin Day&quot; in 2008. The Government of Spain granted Spanish nationality to Martin in 2011, for being &quot;recognized in different artistic facets&quot;. In 2018, in recognition of &quot;his dedication to the island and people of Puerto Rico, his philanthropic work to eliminate human trafficking across the Caribbean, and his commitment to the arts&quot;, the singer received a proclamation naming June 7 the &quot;Ricky Martin Day&quot; in New York City. Throughout his career, Martin has sold over 70 million records making him one of the best-selling Latin music artists of all time.

<text>Gildas (English pronunciation: , Breton: &quot;Gweltaz&quot;; ) — also known as Gildas Badonicus, Gildas fab Caw (in Middle Welsh texts and antiquarian works) and Gildas Sapiens (Gildas the Wise) — was a 6th-century British monk best known for his religious polemic , which recounts the history of the Britons before and during the coming of the Saxons. He is one of the best-documented figures of the Christian church in the British Isles during the sub-Roman period, and was renowned for his Biblical knowledge and literary style. In his later life, he emigrated to Brittany, where he founded a monastery known as Saint-Gildas-de-Rhuys.

==Hagiography==

===Birthplace===
Differing versions of the &quot;Life of Saint Gildas&quot; exist, but both agree that he was born at a place called &quot;Arecluta&quot; which is described by the author as taking its name from a &quot;certain river called the Clut, by which that district is, for the most part, watered.&quot; This was long taken by historians to mean that Gildas was born in what is now Scotland on the banks of the River Clyde.

He is now thought to have his origins farther south. His writing suggests a lack of familiarity with the geography of Strathclyde, but is more accurate with regards to southern Britain. Furthermore, Gildas shows a familiarity with classical Latin texts that historians such as Nick Higham and E.A. Thompson view as more likely to have been acquired further south, within the bounds of former Roman Britain. Thompson suggested Chester as a possible birthplace, while the linguist Andrew Breeze suggests Arclid, near Sandbach in Cheshire, based on its plausible derivation from &quot;Arecluta&quot;.

===Life===
In his own work, he claims to have been born the same year as the Battle of Mount Badon. He was educated at a monastic centre, the College of St. Illtud, where he chose to forsake his royal heritage and embrace monasticism. He became a renowned teacher, converting many to Christianity and founding numerous churches and monasteries throughout Britain and Ireland. He is thought to have made a pilgrimage to Rome before emigrating to Brittany, where he took on the life of a hermit. However, his life of solitude was short-lived, and pupils soon sought him out and begged him to teach them. He eventually founded a monastery for these students at Saint-Gildas-de-Rhuys in Brittany, where he wrote &quot;De Excidio Britanniae,&quot; criticising British rulers and exhorting them to put off their sins and embrace true Christian faith. He is thought to have died at Rhuys and was buried there.

===Biographies===
The First &quot;Life&quot; of Gildas was written in the 9th century by an unnamed monk at the monastery which Gildas founded in Rhuys, Brittany. According to this tradition, Gildas is the son of Caunus, king of Alt Clud in the &quot;Hen Ogledd&quot;, the Brythonic-speaking region of northern Britain. He had four brothers; his brother Cuillum ascended to the throne on the death of his father, and the rest became monks. Gildas was sent as a child to the College of St. Illtud in Glamorgan, under the care of St Illtud, and was a companion of St Samson of Dol and St Paul Aurelian. His master Illtud loved him tenderly and taught him with special zeal. He was supposed to be educated in liberal arts and divine scripture, but elected to study only holy doctrine, and to forsake his noble birth in favour of a religious life.

After completing his studies under Illtud, Gildas went to Ireland where he was ordained as a priest. He returned to his native lands in northern Britain where he acted as a missionary, preaching to the pagan people and converting many of them to Christianity. He was then asked by Ainmericus, high king of Ireland (Ainmuire mac Sétnai, 566–569), to restore order to the church in Ireland, which had altogether lost the Christian faith. Gildas obeyed the king&#x27;s summons and travelled all over the island, converting the inhabitants, building churches, and establishing monasteries. He then travelled to Rome and Ravenna where he performed many miracles, including slaying a dragon while in Rome. Intending to return to Britain, he instead settled on the Isle of Houat off Brittany where he led a solitary, austere life. At around this time, he also preached to Nonnita (Non), the mother of Saint David, while she was pregnant with the saint. He was eventually sought out by those who wished to study under him, and was entreated to establish a monastery in Brittany, which he did at a place now known as Saint-Gildas-de-Rhuys.

The second &quot;Life&quot; of Gildas was written by Caradoc of Llancarfan, a friend of Geoffrey of Monmouth and his Norman patrons. This is an entirely fictional account intended to associate Gildas with Glastonbury Abbey. It also associates him with King Arthur. Arthur kills Gildas&#x27;s brother Hueil, which causes enmity between them for a time. Hueil&#x27;s enmity with Arthur is also mentioned in the Welsh prose tale &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;, written around 1100. A tradition in north Wales places Hueil&#x27;s execution at Ruthin, and the supposed execution stone, Maen Huail, is preserved in the town square. The Llancarfan life also contains the earliest surviving appearance of the abduction of the Guinevere episode, common in later Arthurian literature. Gildas secures the release of Guinevere after she had been abducted by Melvas, king of the &quot;Summer Country&quot;, preventing war between him and Arthur.

==&quot;De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae&quot;==

Gildas is best known for his polemic , which recounts the sub-Roman history of Britain, and which is the only substantial source for history of this period written by a near-contemporary, although it is not intended to be an objective chronicle.

The work is a sermon in three parts condemning the acts of his contemporaries, both secular and religious. The first part consists of Gildas&#x27; explanation for his work and a brief narrative of Roman Britain from its conquest under the Principate to Gildas&#x27; time. He describes the doings of the Romans and the Groans of the Britons, in which the Britons make one last request for military aid from the departed Roman military. He excoriates his fellow Britons for their sins, while at the same time lauding heroes such as Ambrosius Aurelianus, whom he is the first to describe as a leader of the resistance to the Saxons. He mentions the victory at the Battle of Mons Badonicus, a feat attributed to King Arthur in later texts, though Gildas does not mention who led the battle.

Part two consists of a condemnation of five British kings, Constantine, Aurelius Conanus, Vortiporius, Cuneglasus, and Maelgwn. As it is the only contemporary information about them, it is of particular interest to scholars of British history. Part three is a similar attack on the clergy of the time.

The works of Gildas, including the &quot;Excidio&quot;, can be found in volume 69 of the &quot;Patrologia Latina.&quot;

&quot;De Excidio&quot; was usually dated to the 540s, but the historian Guy Halsall inclines to an &quot;early Gildas&quot; c. 490. Cambridge historian Karen George offered a date range of c. 510–530 AD. Gildas states that he was 44 when he wrote the work.

==Veneration==
Gildas&#x27; relics were venerated in the abbey which he founded in Rhuys, until the 10th century, when they were removed to Berry. In the 18th century, they were said to be moved to the cathedral at Vannes and then hidden during the French Revolution. The various relics survived the revolution and have all since been returned to Saint-Gildas-de-Rhuys where they are visible at various times of the year at a dedicated &quot;treasury&quot; in the village. The body of Saint Gildas (minus the pieces incorporated into various reliquaries) is buried behind the altar in the church of Saint Gildas de Rhuys.

The gold and silver covered relics of Saint Gildas include:

* A reliquary head containing parts of the saint&#x27;s skull 
* An arm reliquary containing bone pieces, topped with a blessing hand 
* A reliquary femur and knee 

The embroidered mitre supposedly worn by Gildas is also kept with these relics. Gildas is the patron saint of several churches and monasteries in Brittany, and his feast day is celebrated on 29 January.

===Further traditions===
Gildas is credited with a hymn called the &quot;Lorica&quot;, or &quot;Breastplate&quot;, a prayer for deliverance from evil, which contains specimens of Hiberno-Latin. A proverb is also attributed to &quot;Gildas mab y Gaw&quot; in the &quot;Englynion y Clyweid&quot; in Llanstephan MS. 27.

In &quot;Bonedd y Saint&quot;, Gildas is recorded as having three sons and a daughter. Gwynnog ap Gildas and Noethon ap Gildas are named in the earliest tracts, together with their sister Dolgar. Another son, Tydech, is named in a later document. Iolo Morganwg adds Saint Cenydd to the list.

The scholar David Dumville suggests that Gildas was the teacher of Finnian of Moville, who in turn was the teacher of St Columba of Iona.

<text>Tarn ( or ; ) is a department in the Occitania region in Southern France. Named after the river Tarn, it had a population of 389,844 as of 2019. Its prefecture and largest city is Albi; it has a single subprefecture, Castres. In French, the inhabitants of Tarn are known as (masculine) and (feminine). Its INSEE and postcode number is 81.

==History==
Tarn is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790, through application of the Law of 22 December 1789. It was created from part of the former province of Languedoc, and comprised the dioceses of Albi and Castres (which found themselves merged in 1817).
The new department had five districts: Albi, Castres, Lavaur, Gaillac, Lacaune. The capitals (now prefectures) were, alternatively, Albi and Castres but, from 1790 to 1797, the capital was only Albi; in 1797, the capital was moved to Castres. In 1800, Albi became again the capital of the department and the arrondissements were created; the department had four arrondissements: Albi, Castres, Gaillac and Lavaur. In 1926, the arrondissements of Gaillac and Lavaur were eliminated.

By the law of 28 Pluviôse Year 5, the departments of Hérault and of Tarn exchanged the canton of Anglès (which had been part of the diocese of Saint-Pons, but which has remained in Tarn) for that of Saint-Gervais-sur-Mare (which had been part of the diocese of Castres, but which today remains in Hérault).

== Geography ==

Tarn is part of the Occitanie region and has an area of . The department is surrounded by five departments, all belonging to the region Occitanie: Hérault to the southeast, Aude to the south, Aveyron to the north and east, Haute-Garonne to the southwest and west, as well as Tarn-et-Garonne to the northwest. It is one of two French departments surrounded entirely by other departments of the same region.

The slope of the department is from east to west, and its general character is mountainous or hilly. Tarn&#x27;s three principal ranges lying to the south-east are: the Mountains of Lacaune, the Sidobre and the Montagne Noire, belonging to the Cévennes.

The stony and wind-blown slopes of the Mountains of Lacaune (&quot;Monts de Lacaune&quot;) are used for pasture. The highest point of the range and of the department is the &quot;Puech Montgrand&quot;, high; several other summits are not much short of this. The granite-strewn plateaux of the Sidobre, from high, separate the valley of the river Agout from that of its western tributary, the Thoré River. The Montagne Noire, on the southwestern border of the department, derives its name from the forests on its northern slope. Its highest point is the Pic de Nore at high.

The limestone and sandstone foot-hills are clothed with vines and fruit trees, and are broken by deep alluvial valleys of particular fertility. With the exception of a small portion of the Montagne Noire, which drains into the river Aude, the whole department belongs to the basin of the Garonne.

<text>Thai numerals (, , ) are a set of numerals traditionally used in Thailand, although the Arabic numerals are more common due to extensive westernization of Thailand in the modern Rattanakosin period. Thai numerals follow the Hindu–Arabic numeral system commonly used in the rest of the world. In Thai language, numerals often follow the modified noun and precede a measure word, although variations to this pattern occur.

==Usage==
The Thai language lacks grammatical number. A count is usually expressed in the form of an uninflected noun followed by a number and a classifier. &quot;Five teachers&quot; is expressed as &quot;teacher five person&quot; ( or with the numeral included .) &quot;person&quot; is a type of referent noun that is also used as the Thai part of speech called in English a linguistic classifier, or measure word. In Thai, counting is &quot;kannap&quot; (; &quot;nap&quot; is &quot;to count&quot;, &quot;kan&quot; is a prefix that forms a noun from a verb); the classifier, &quot;laksananam&quot; ( from &quot;laksana&quot; characteristic, form, attribute, quality, pattern, style; and &quot;nam&quot; name, designation, appellation.) Variations to this pattern do occur, and there really is no hierarchy among Thai classifiers.
A partial list of Thai words that also classify nouns can be found in Wiktionary category: 

==Main numbers==

===Zero to ten===
Thai (zero) is written as oval 0 (number) when using Arabic numerals, but a small circle when using traditional numerals, and also means &quot;&quot; in other contexts. It is from Sanskrit &quot;śūnya&quot;, as are the (context-driven) alternate names for numbers one to four given below; but not the counting 1 (number). 

Thai names for &quot;N&quot; +1 and the regular digits 2 through 9 as shown in the table, below, resemble those in Chinese varieties (e.g., Cantonese and Min Nan) as spoken in Southern China, the homeland of the overseas Chinese living in South East Asia. In fact, the etymology of Thai numerals 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 is Middle Chinese, while the etymology of Thai numeral 5 is Old Chinese, as illustrated in the table below.

Numerical digit characters, however, are almost identical to Khmer numerals. Thai and Lao words for numerals are almost identical, however, the numerical digits vary somewhat in shape. Shown above is a comparison between three languages using Cantonese and Minnan characters and pronunciations. Shown below is a comparison between three languages using Khmer numerals: Thai, Khmer, and Lao. The Thai transliteration uses the Royal Thai General System of Transcription (RTGS).

===Ten to a million===
Sanskrit lakh designates the place value of a digit (&quot;tamnaeng khong tua lek&quot;, ตําแหน่งของตัวเลข), which are named for the powers of ten: the unit&#x27;s place is &quot;lak nuai&quot; (หลักหน่วย); ten&#x27;s place, &quot;lak sip&quot; (หลักสิบ); hundred&#x27;s place, &quot;lak roi&quot; (หลักร้อย), and so forth. The number one following any multiple of &quot;sip&quot; becomes &quot;et&quot; (Cantonese: 一, yat1; Minnan: 一, it4). The number ten (&quot;sip&quot;) is the same as Literary Hokkien 十 (si̍p). Numbers from twenty to twenty nine begin with &quot;yi sip&quot; (Cantonese: 二十 (yi6sap6); Hokkien: 二十 (lī-cha̍p / jī-cha̍p / gī-cha̍p); Teochew: 二十 (jĭ tsa̍p)). Names of the &quot;lak sip&quot; for 30 to 90, and for the &quot;lak&quot; of 100, 1000, 10,000, 100,000 and million, are almost identical to those of the like Khmer numerals. 

For the numbers twenty-one through twenty-nine, the part signifying twenty: &quot;yi sip&quot; (ยี่สิบ), may be colloquially shortened to &quot;yip&quot; (ยีบ). See the alternate numbers section below.

The hundreds are formed by combining &quot;roi&quot; with the tens and ones values. For example, two hundred and thirty-two is &quot;song roi sam sip song&quot;. The words &quot;roi&quot;, &quot;phan&quot;, &quot;muen&quot;, and &quot;saen&quot; should occur with a preceding numeral (&quot;nueng&quot; is optional), so two hundred ten, for example, is &quot;song roi sip&quot;, and one hundred is either &quot;roi&quot; or &quot;nueng roi&quot;. &quot;Nueng&quot; never precedes &quot;sip&quot;, so &quot;song roi nueng sip&quot; is incorrect. Native speakers will sometimes use &quot;roi nueng&quot; (or &quot;phan nueng&quot;, etc.) with different tones on &quot;nueng&quot; to distinguish one hundred from one hundred and one. However, such distinction is often not made, and ambiguity may follow. To resolve this problem, if the number 101 (or 1001, 10001, etc.) is intended, one should say &quot;roi et&quot; (or &quot;phan et&quot;, &quot;muen et&quot;, etc.).

===Numbers above a million===
Numbers above a million are constructed by prefixing &quot;lan&quot; with a multiplier. For example, ten million is &quot;sip lan&quot;, and a trillion (1012, a long scale billion) is &quot;lan lan&quot;.

===Decimal and fractional numbers===
Colloquially, decimal numbers are formed by saying &quot;chut&quot; (จุด, dot) where the decimal separator is located. For example, 1.01 is &quot;nueng chut sun nueng&quot; (หนึ่งจุดศูนย์หนึ่ง).

Fractional numbers are formed by placing &quot;nai&quot; (ใน, in, of) between the numerator and denominator or using &quot;[set] x suan y&quot; ([เศษ] x ส่วน y, x parts of the whole y) to clearly indicate. For example, is &quot;nueng nai sam&quot; (หนึ่งในสาม) or &quot;[set] nueng suan sam&quot; ([เศษ]หนึ่งส่วนสาม). The word &quot;set&quot; (เศษ) can be omitted.

The word &quot;khrueng&quot; (ครึ่ง) is used for &quot;half&quot;. It precedes the measure word if used alone, but it follows the measure word when used with another number. For example, &quot;kradat khrueng phaen&quot; (กระดาษครึ่งแผ่น) means &quot;half sheet of paper&quot;, but &quot;kradat nueng phaen khrueng&quot; (กระดาษหนึ่งแผ่นครึ่ง) means &quot;one and a half sheets of paper&quot;.

===Negative numbers===
Negative numbers are formed by placing &quot;lop&quot; (ลบ, minus) in front of the number. For example, −11 is &quot;lop sip et&quot; (ลบสิบเอ็ด).

===Ordinal numbers===
Ordinal numbers are formed by placing &quot;thi&quot; (ที่, place) in front of the number. They are not considered a special class of numbers, since the numeral still follows a modified noun, which is &quot;thi&quot; in this case.
==Alternative numbers==

===Ai===
Ai () is used for &quot;first born (son)&quot; or for the first month, &quot;duean ai&quot; (เดือนอ้าย), of the Thai lunar calendar.

=== Ek ===
 () is from Pali &quot;ḗka&quot;, &quot;one&quot; &quot;Ek&quot; is used for &quot;one&quot; (quantity); &quot;first&quot; (rank), more prominent than &quot;tho&quot; โท &quot;second&quot;, in tone marks, education degrees and military ranks; and for the lead actor in a role. In antiquity, a seventh daughter was called &quot;luk ek&quot; (ลูกเอก), though a seventh son was &quot;luk chet&quot; (ลูกเจ็ด).

===Et===
Et (, Cantonese: 一, jat1; Minnan: 一, it4), meaning &quot;one&quot;, is used as last member in a compound number (see the main numbers section above).

=== Tho ===
Tho () is from Pali &quot;dūā&quot;, &quot;two&quot;. &quot;Tho&quot; is used for &quot;two&quot; and for the &quot;second-level rank&quot; in tone marks, education degrees and military ranks.

===Yi===
Yi (, Cantonese: 二, ji6; Minnan: 二, ji7) is still used in several places in Thai language for the number two, apart from &quot;song&quot; (สอง): to construct twenty (two tens) and its combinations twenty-one through twenty-nine; to name the second month, &quot;duean yi&quot; (เดือนยี่), of the traditional Thai lunar calendar; and in the Thai northern dialect &quot;thin pha yap&quot; (ถิ่นพายัพ), in which it refers to the Year of the Tiger.

===Tri &amp; Trai===
Tri () and trai () are from Sanskrit &quot;trāyaḥ&quot;, &quot;three&quot;. These alternatives are used for &quot;three&quot;; &quot;third rank&quot; in tone marks, education degrees and military ranks; and as a prefix meaning &quot;three(fold)&quot;.

===Chattawa===
Chattawa () is the Pali numeral four; used for the fourth tone mark and as a prefix meaning fourth in order or quadruple in number.

===Lo===
Lo () means a dozen or twelve. It is usually used for trade. It may also mean jar or bottle.

===Yip===
Yip () in colloquial Thai is an elision or contraction of &quot;yi sip&quot; (ยี่สิบ) at the beginning of numbers twenty-one through twenty-nine. Therefore, one may hear &quot;yip et&quot; (ยีบเอ็ด, ยิบเอ็ด), &quot;yip song&quot; (ยีบสอง, ยิบสอง), up to &quot;yip kao&quot; (ยีบเก้า, ยิบเก้า). &quot;Yip&quot; may have a long vowel (ยีบ) or be elided further into a short vowel (ยิบ).

===Sao===
Sao () is twenty in the Thai northern dialect and in the Isan language. It is related to &quot;xao&quot; (ຊາວ), the word for twenty in the Lao language.

===Kurut===
Kurut () means a dozen dozen or 144. It is usually used for trade. It is a loanword from gross.

===Kot===
Kot () is ten million used in religious context. It comes from Pali/Sanskrit &quot;kōṭi&quot;. See also crore.

== Tone marks, education degrees and military ranks ==
The alternate set of numerals used to name tonal marks (ไม้, &quot;mai&quot;), educational degrees (ปริญญา, &quot;parinya&quot;), and military rankings derive from names of Sanskrit numerals.

<doc id="84075" wikidata="Q59734" url="?curid=84075" title="Demetrius I Poliorcetes">
<text>Demetrius I Poliorcetes (; , , ; ) was a Macedonian Greek nobleman and military leader who became king of Asia between 306 and 301 BC, and king of Macedon between 294 and 288 BC. A member of the Antigonid dynasty, he was the son of its founder, Antigonus I Monophthalmus, and his wife Stratonice, as well as the first member of the family to rule Macedon in Hellenistic Greece. 

In 307 BC, Demetrius successfully ousted Cassander&#x27;s governor of Athens and after defeating Ptolemy I at the Battle of Salamis (306 BC) he gave his father the title of &quot;basileus&quot; (&quot;king&quot;) over a land spanning from the Aegean Sea to the Middle East. He acquired the title &quot;Poliorcetes&quot; (&quot;the besieger&quot;) after the unsuccessful siege of Rhodes in 305. While Antigonus I and Demetrius planned a revival of the Hellenic League with themselves as dual hegemons, a coalition of the diadochi; Cassander, Seleucus I, Ptolemy I, and Lysimachus defeated the two at the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC, in which Antigonus I was killed and the Asian territory of his empire was lost. In 294, Demetrius managed to successfully seize control of Athens and establish himself as king of Macedon. He ruled until 288 when he was eventually driven out by Pyrrhus and Lysimachus and later surrendered to Seleucus I in Cilicia, dying there in 283. After a long period of instability, Demetrius&#x27;s son, Antigonus II Gonatas, managed to solidify the dynasty in the kingdom and establish its hegemony over much of Hellenistic Greece.

Demetrius was particularly involved in innovations in poliorcetics, and although not all of his sieges were successful—such as the siege of Rhodes—he left his mark on the history of global siege warfare. This was notably through the extensive use of siege engines, the establishment of effective logistical procedures to support sieges on a much larger scale than previously, the widespread use of amphibious warfare and finally the very quick pace of execution of his sieges. Demetrius also used his skills as a military architect to fortify cities with defensive architectural innovations, such as, notably, Athens, Sicyon or Corinth. He can be considered one of the main Epigoni, the heirs of the Diadochi.

==Biography==

===Early career===
Demetrius served with his father, Antigonus I Monophthalmus, during the Second War of the Diadochi. He participated in the Battle of Paraitakene where he commanded the cavalry on the right flank. Despite the Antigonid left flank, commanded by Peithon, being routed, and the center, commanded by Antigonus, being dealt heavy losses at the hands of the famous Silver Shields, Demetrius was victorious on the right, and his success there ultimately prevented the battle from being a complete loss.

Demetrius was again present at the conclusive Battle of Gabiene. Directly after the battle, while Antigonus held the betrayed Eumenes, Demetrius was one of the few who implored his father to spare the Greek successor&#x27;s life.

At the age of twenty-one he was left by his father to defend Syria against Ptolemy the son of Lagus. He was defeated at the Battle of Gaza, but soon partially repaired his loss by a victory in the Battle of Myus, against a general of Ptolemy, Cilles. In the spring of 310, he was soundly defeated when he tried to expel Seleucus I Nicator from Babylon; his father was defeated in the autumn. As a result of this Babylonian War, Antigonus lost almost two thirds of his empire: all eastern satrapies fell to Seleucus.

After several campaigns against Ptolemy on the coasts of Cilicia and Cyprus, Demetrius sailed with a fleet of 250 ships to Athens. He freed the city from the power of Cassander and Ptolemy, expelled the garrison which had been stationed there under Demetrius of Phalerum, and besieged and took Munychia (307 BC). After these victories he was worshipped by the Athenians as a tutelary deity under the title of &quot;Soter&quot; (, &quot;Saviour&quot;). At this time Demetrius married Eurydike, an Athenian noblewoman who was reputed to be descendant from Miltiades; she was the widow of Ophellas, Ptolemy&#x27;s governor of Cyrene. Antigonus sent Demetrius instructions to sail to Cyprus and attack Ptolemy&#x27;s positions there.

Demetrius sailed from Athens in the spring of 306 BC and in accordance with his father&#x27;s orders he first went to Caria where he summoned the Rhodians in an unsuccessful attempt to support his naval campaign. In the campaign of 306 BC, he defeated Ptolemy and Menelaus, Ptolemy&#x27;s brother, in the naval Battle of Salamis, completely destroying the naval power of Ptolemaic Egypt. Demetrius conquered Cyprus in 306 BC, capturing one of Ptolemy&#x27;s sons. Following the victory, Antigonus assumed the title &quot;king&quot; and bestowed the same upon his son Demetrius. In 305 BC, he endeavoured to punish the Rhodians for having deserted his cause; his ingenuity in devising new siege engines in his (ultimately unsuccessful) attempt to reduce the capital gained him the title of Poliorcetes. Among his creations were a battering ram long, requiring 1000 men to operate it; and a wheeled siege tower named &quot;Helepolis&quot; (or &quot;Taker of Cities&quot;) which stood tall and wide, weighing . After failing to conquer Rhodes the weapons were abandoned. With the bronze from these weapons used by the Rhodians to construct the Colossus of Rhodes.
In 304 BC, he returned a second time to Greece as liberator, and reinstated the Corinthian League, but his licentiousness and extravagance made the Athenians long for the government of Cassander. Among his outrages was his courtship of a young boy named Democles the Handsome. The youth kept on refusing his attention but one day found himself cornered at the baths. Having no way out and being unable to physically resist his suitor, he took the lid off the hot water cauldron and jumped in. His death was seen as a mark of honor for himself and his country. In another instance, Demetrius waived a fine of 50 talents imposed on a citizen in exchange for the favors of Cleaenetus, that man&#x27;s son. He also sought the attention of Lamia, a Greek courtesan. He demanded 250 talents from the Athenians, which he then gave to Lamia and other courtesans to buy soap and cosmetics.

He also roused the jealousy of Alexander&#x27;s Diadochi; Seleucus, Cassander and Lysimachus united to destroy him and his father. The hostile armies met at the Battle of Ipsus in Phrygia (301 BC). Antigonus was killed, and Demetrius, after sustaining severe losses, retired to Ephesus. This reversal of fortune stirred up many enemies against him—the Athenians refused even to admit him into their city. But he soon afterwards ravaged the territory of Lysimachus and effected a reconciliation with Seleucus, to whom he gave his daughter Stratonice in marriage. Athens was at this time oppressed by the tyranny of Lachares—a popular leader who made himself supreme in Athens in 296 BC—but Demetrius, after a protracted blockade, gained possession of the city (294 BC) and pardoned the inhabitants for their misconduct in 301 BC in a great display of mercy, a trait Demetrius highly valued in a ruler.

After Athens&#x27; capitulation, Demetrius formed a new government which espoused a major dislocation of traditional democratic forms, which anti Macedonian democrats would have called oligarchy. The cyclical rotation of the secretaries of the Council and the election of archons by allotment, were both abolished. In 294/3 - 293/2 BC, two of the most prominent men in Athens were designated by the Macedonian king, Olympiordoros and Phillipides of Paiania. Their appointment by the King is implied by Plutarch who says that &quot;he established the archons which were most acceptable to the Demos.&quot;

===King of Macedonia===

In 294 BC, he established himself on the throne of Macedonia by murdering Alexander V, the son of Cassander. He faced rebellion from the Boeotians but secured the region after capturing Thebes in 291 BC. That year he married Lanassa, the former wife of Pyrrhus, but his new position as ruler of Macedonia was continually threatened by Pyrrhus, who took advantage of his occasional absence to ravage the defenceless part of his kingdom (Plutarch, &quot;Pyrrhus&quot;, 7 ff.); at length, the combined forces of Pyrrhus, Ptolemy and Lysimachus, assisted by the disaffected among his own subjects, obliged him to leave Macedonia in 288 BC.

After besieging Athens without success he passed into Asia and attacked some of the provinces of Lysimachus with varying success. Famine and pestilence destroyed the greater part of his army, and he solicited Seleucus&#x27; support and assistance. However, before he reached Syria hostilities broke out, and after he had gained some advantages over his son-in-law, Demetrius was totally forsaken by his troops on the field of battle and surrendered to Seleucus.

His son Antigonus offered all his possessions, and even his own person, in order to procure his father&#x27;s liberty, but all proved unavailing, and Demetrius died after a confinement of three years (283 BC). His remains were given to Antigonus and honoured with a splendid funeral at Corinth. His descendants remained in possession of the Macedonian throne until the time of Perseus, when Macedon was conquered by the Romans in 168 BC.

=== Military legacy ===

==== Besieger and logistician ====

During his 30-year military career, from the Battle of Paraitakene in 317 BC to his final defeat, Demetrius proved to be a hugely effective commander during sieges. Notably, he managed to use the innovations introduced by Alexander, scaling them up to greater extents. Thus, besides the massive and widespread use of siege engines, which he standardized in Hellenistic warfare, Demetrius was an excellent logistician, able to maintain sieges on unprecedented scales. The Antigonid also engaged in amphibious siege warfare, frequently conducting sieges both by sea and land. Finally, despite some failed sieges, especially the siege of Rhodes where Demetrius did not appear to make significant tactical or strategic errors, he employed a siege warfare strategy sometimes described as &#x27;blitzkrieg&#x27;. During his campaigns in 304-303 BC and 294-291 BC in Greece, after rapid &#x27;bursts&#x27;, he captured cities one after another in a matter of months; for example, in 304-303 BC, he successively seized Panactum, Phyle, Kechries, Epidaurus, Sicyon, Corinth, Bura, Scirus (Arcadia), Argos, and Orchomenus. According to Plutarch, Demetrius would have commanded 110,000 soldiers under his leadership in 288 BCE before facing complete defeat. This figure is almost certainly exaggerated by the ancient author and would represent the largest concentration of manpower in the entire Hellenistic period, more than two times larger than the force Alexander led in his initial conquests. Even if the figure is overstated, it demonstrates that Demetrius was capable of assembling significant armies, some of which were remembered as the largest of the era.

==== Military engineer and builder ====
Demetrius also emerged as an important military engineer and fortifier of cities. Firstly, he established effective strategies and developed new siege engines to address specific challenges during certain sieges or to experiment with new methods of siege warfare. In addition to his interest in military engineering, Demetrius distinguished himself by constructing and erecting numerous fortifications, significantly influencing this discipline and leaving his mark on the history of the Greek world. 

For instance, in 307-306 BC, after his first capture of Athens, he undertook one of the most significant fortification projects in the city&#x27;s history. In 303 BC, after capturing Sicyon and noticing the weaknesses in its defenses, he decided to completely relocate the city to a more defensible position and, according to Plutarch, personally worked on the construction of the new city.

Corinth also appears to have undergone substantial fortification work initiated by Demetrius after he conquered the city, as suggested by archaeological discoveries related to the urbanization of the city at that time. These elements also highlight his impact on the history of defensive siege warfare and paint the picture of a builder king.

=== Literary references ===

==== Plutarch ====
Plutarch wrote a biography of Demetrius, in which he is paired with Mark Antony.

==== Hegel ====

Hegel, in the &quot;Lectures on the History of Philosophy&quot;, says of another Demetrius, Demetrius Phalereus, that &quot;Demetrius Phalereus and others were thus soon after [Alexander] honoured and worshipped in Athens as God.&quot; What the exact source was for Hegel&#x27;s claim is unclear. Diogenes Laërtius in his short biography of Demetrius Phalereus does not mention this. Apparently Hegel&#x27;s error comes from a misreading of Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Life of Demetrius&quot; which is about Demetrius Poliorcetes and not Demetrius of Phalereus. Plutarch describes in the work how Demetrius Poliorcetes conquered Demetrius Phalereus at Athens. Then, in chapter 12 of the work, Plutarch describes how Demetrius Poliorcetes was given honors due to the god Dionysus. This account by Plutarch was confusing not only for Hegel, but for others as well.

==== Others ====
Plutarch&#x27;s account of Demetrius&#x27;s departure from Macedonia in 288 BC inspired Constantine Cavafy to write &quot;King Demetrius&quot; (ὁ βασιλεὺς Δημήτριος) in 1906, his earliest surviving poem on an historical theme.

Demetrius is the main character of the opera Demetrio a Rodi (Turin, 1789) with libretto by Giandomenico Boggio and Giuseppe Banti. The music is set by Gaetano Pugnani (1731-1798).

Demetrius appears (under the Greek form of his name, Demetrios) in L. Sprague de Camp&#x27;s historical novel,&quot; The Bronze God of Rhodes&quot;, which largely concerns itself with his siege of Rhodes.

Alfred Duggan&#x27;s novel &quot;Elephants and Castles&quot; provides a lively fictionalised account of his life.

==Family==
Demetrius was married five times:

* His first wife was Phila daughter of Regent Antipater by whom he had two children: Stratonice of Syria and Antigonus II Gonatas. 
* His second wife was Eurydice of Athens, by whom he is said to have had a son called Corrhabus. 
* His third wife was Deidamia, a sister of Pyrrhus of Epirus. Deidamia bore him a son called Alexander, who is said by Plutarch to have spent his life in Egypt, probably in an honourable captivity.
* His fourth wife was Lanassa, the former wife of his brother-in-law Pyrrhus of Epirus. 
* His fifth wife was Ptolemais, daughter of Ptolemy I Soter and Eurydice of Egypt, by whom he had a son called Demetrius the Fair.

He also had a relationship with a celebrated courtesan called Lamia of Athens, by whom he had a daughter called Phila.

<text>Tufts University is a private research university in Medford and Somerville, Massachusetts, United States, with additional facilities in Boston and Grafton, as well as Talloires, France. Tufts also has several Doctor of Physical Therapy programs located in Boston, Phoenix and Seattle. It was founded in 1852 as Tufts College by Christian universalists who sought to provide a nonsectarian institution of higher learning. Tufts remained a small liberal arts college until the 1970s, when it transformed into a large research university offering doctorates in several disciplines. The corporate name of the university is &quot;Trustees of Tufts College&quot;. 

Tufts offers over 90 undergraduate and 160 graduate programs across ten schools in the greater Boston area and Talloires, France. It has the country&#x27;s oldest graduate school of international relations, the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. The largest school is the School of Arts and Sciences, which includes both the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts University, which is affiliated with the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The School of Engineering offers an entrepreneurial focus through its Gordon Institute and maintains close connections with the original college. It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot; and is a member of the Association of American Universities.

Tufts has a campus in Downtown Boston that houses the medical, dental, and nutrition schools and the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, affiliated with several medical centers in the area. Joint undergraduate degree programs are offered with the New England Conservatory, the College of Europe, and Sciences Po Paris.

==History==
===19th century===

In the 1840s, the Universalist Church wanted to open a college in New England, and Charles Tufts donated 20 acres to the church in 1852 to help them achieve this goal. Charles Tufts had inherited the land, a barren hill which was one of the highest points in the Boston area, called Walnut Hill, and when asked by a family member what he intended to do with the land, he said &quot;I will put a light on it.&quot; His 20-acre donation (then valued at $20,000) is still at the heart of Tufts&#x27; now-150-acre campus, straddling Somerville and Medford. It was also in 1852 that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts chartered Tufts College, noting the college should promote &quot;virtue and piety and learning in such of the languages and liberal and useful arts as shall be recommended.&quot; During his tenure, Hosea Ballou spent a year travelling and studying in the United Kingdom. The methods of instruction which he initiated were based on the tutorials that were conducted in the University of Oxford and the University of Edinburgh. Now more than 170 years old, Tufts is the third-oldest college in the Boston area.

Having been one of the biggest influences in the establishment of the college, Hosea Ballou II became the first president in 1853, and College Hall, the first building on campus, was completed the following year. That building now bears Ballou&#x27;s name. The campus opened in August 1854. President Ballou died in 1861 and was succeeded by Alonzo Ames Miner. Though not a college graduate, his presidency was marked by several advances. These include the establishment of preparatory schools for Tufts which include Goddard Seminary, Westbrook Seminary, and Dean Academy. During the Civil War the college actively supported the Union cause. The mansion of Major George L. Stearns which stood on part of the campus was a station on the Underground Railroad. In addition to having the largest classes spring up, 63 graduates served in the Union army. The first course of a three-year program leading to a degree in civil engineering was established in 1865, the same year MIT was founded. By 1869, the Crane Theological School was organized.

Miner&#x27;s successor Elmer Capen was the first president to be a Tufts alumnus. During his time, one of the earliest innovators was Amos Dolbear. In 1875, as chair of the physics department, he installed a working telephone which connected his lab in Ballou Hall to his home on Professors Row. Two years later Alexander Graham Bell would receive the patent. Dolbear&#x27;s work in Tufts was later continued by Marconi and Tesla. Other famous scholars include William Leslie Hooper who in addition to serving as acting president, designed the first slotted armature for dynamos. His student at the college, Frederick Stark Pearson, would eventually become one of America&#x27;s pioneers of the electrical power industry. He became responsible for the development of the electric power and electric streetcar systems which many cities in South America and Europe used. Another notable figure is Stephen M. Babcock who developed the first practical test to determine the amount of butterfat in milk. Since its development in the college, the Babcock Test has hardly been modified. Expansion of the chemistry and biology departments were largely led by scholars Arthur Michael, who was one of the first organic chemists in the U.S., and John Sterling Kingsley, who was one of the first scholars of comparative anatomy.

P. T. Barnum was one of the earliest benefactors of Tufts College, and the Barnum Museum of Natural History (Barnum Hall) was constructed in 1884 with funds donated by him to house his collection of animal specimens and the stuffed hide of Jumbo the elephant, who would become the university&#x27;s mascot. The building stood until April 14, 1975, when a fire gutted Barnum Hall, destroying the entire collection.

On July 15, 1892, the Tufts Board of Trustees voted &quot;that the College be opened to women in the undergraduate departments on the same terms and conditions as men.&quot; Metcalf Hall opened in 1893 and served as the dormitory for women. At the same meeting, the trustees voted to create a graduate school faculty and to offer the PhD degree in biology and chemistry. In 1893 the Medical School opened and in 1899 the Boston Dental College was integrated into the university. In 1890, the Department of Electrical Engineering was created, and in 1892–1893 the course of three-year program in civil engineering was extended to four years. With the advent of the four-year program the degrees granted were bachelor of civil or electrical engineering. Tufts College added the Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Department of Chemical Engineering in 1894 and 1898, respectively. In 1898, the trustees voted to formally establish an undergraduate College of Engineering.

===20th century===
The Jackson College for Women was established in 1910 as a coordinate college adjacent to the Tufts campus. In 1980 it was integrated with the College of Liberal Arts but is still recognized in the formal name of the undergraduate arts and sciences division, the &quot;College of Liberal Arts and Jackson College&quot;. Undergraduate women in arts and sciences continued to receive their diplomas from Jackson College until 2002.

Tufts expanded in 1933 with the opening of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, the first graduate school of international affairs in the United States. The Fletcher School began as a joint effort between Tufts and Harvard University, funded by an endowment from longtime Tufts benefactor and alumnus Austin Barclay Fletcher. Tufts assumed full administration of the Fletcher School in 1935, and strong linkages between the two schools remain.

During World War II, Tufts College was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission.

Due to travel restrictions imposed by World War II, the Boston Red Sox conducted spring training for the 1943 Major League season at Tufts College. In 1955, continued expansion was reflected in the change of the school&#x27;s name to Tufts University, though the corporate name remains as &#x27;Trustees of Tufts College&#x27;.

The university experienced some growth during the presidency of Jean Mayer (1976–1992). Mayer established Tufts&#x27; veterinary, nutrition, and biomedical schools and acquired the Grafton and Talloires campuses, at the same time lifting the university out of its dire financial situation by increasing the size of the endowment by a factor of 15.

The College of Engineering added graduate study to its curriculum beginning in 1961, with master&#x27;s degrees available in four departments. It added PhD programs in mechanical engineering in 1963, electrical engineering in 1964, engineering design in 1981, and civil engineering in 1985. In 1984, CEO and chairman of Analogic Corporation and NeuroLogica Corporation Bernard Marshall Gordon founded the Tufts Gordon Institute as the first educational institution created to foster entrepreneurship in the engineering fields. In 1991 the New England Association of Schools and Colleges accredited the institute to confer the degree of Master of Science in Engineering Management and in 1992 the Gordon Institute became part of the College of Engineering. In 1999, the College of Engineering became the School of Engineering, when oversight of graduate engineering programs was transferred from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. As part of the same reorganization the Faculty of Arts and Science became the Faculty of Arts, Sciences, and Engineering (AS&amp;E).

===21st century===

Under President Larry Bacow, Tufts started a capital campaign in 2006 with the goal of raising $1.2 billion to implement full need-blind admission by 2011. the campaign raised $1.14 billion. Tufts received the largest donations in its history since 2005, including a $136 million bequest to its endowment upon the dissolution of a charitable trust set up by 1911 alumnus Frank C. Doble, a $100 million (~$ in ) gift from eBay founder Pierre Omidyar to establish the Omidyar-Tufts Microfinance Fund, and a number of $40 million (~$ in )-plus gifts to specific schools.

Anthony P. Monaco, formerly of Oxford University, became Tufts&#x27; thirteenth president on October 21, 2011.

As of October 15, 2015, Computer Science surpassed International Relations as the largest major at the university, with 466 declared majors.

On December 22, 2015, the university announced that it would acquire the School of the Museum of Fine Arts. The merger was completed on June 30, 2016. One of the key figures in the merger, Nancy Bauer, became the dean of the museum school.

In December 2015, the university completed a reconstruction of the Memorial Stairs. A new Central Energy Plant was under construction and set to finish in the summer of 2016. It will replace an aging 60-year-old plant and provide new efficiency boilers which in addition to providing the university directly with electricity, heated and chilled water, will help the university cut emissions. The university also completed construction of the Science and Engineering Complex (SEC) in 2017. The SEC features laboratories and fosters interdisciplinary research between the neuroscience and environmental science departments. The SEC joins the newly rehabilitated 574 Boston Avenue in the expansion of classroom and laboratory facilities for the engineering school. In the spring of 2022, the university plans to open the newly constructed Joyce Cummings Center, an interdisciplinary academic building which will house the computer science and economics departments, among others.

In 2016, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen pledged a $10 million (~$ in ) donation over four years for the creation of the Allen Discovery Centers at Tufts and Stanford. The centers would fund research that would read and write the morphogenetic code. Tufts biologist Michael Levin will lead the center with research focusing on communications between cells and the causation of birth defects, cancer, traumatic injuries and degenerative diseases.

In 2020, Tufts announced that it would pay the MBTA $2 million (~$ in ) over 10 years to rename the adjacent Green Line Extension station from &quot;College Avenue&quot; to &quot;.&quot; The Medford Branch opened to Medford/Tufts on December 12, 2022.

After twelve years as president, Anthony Monaco retired in 2023. Sunil Kumar, previously the provost of Johns Hopkins University, became the university&#x27;s 14th president on July 1, 2023.

On April 7, 2024, Tufts students joined other campuses across the United States in protests and setting up encampments in protest against the Israel–Hamas war. The protestors demands included disclosure of University investments and divestment from Israel. The encampment ended after a month with Tufts Students for Justice in Palestine rejecting what it called “a bad-faith deal” offered by the administration. More than 250 members of the graduating class threatened to boycott commencement and called for an end to &quot;Tuft University’s financial complicity in the ongoing devastation of Gaza&quot;.

Tufts&#x27; main campus is located on Walnut Hill in Medford and Somerville, about from Boston on the site of the original farm of Charles Tufts, the university&#x27;s namesake. This campus houses all undergraduates in Arts &amp; Sciences and Engineering, the graduate programs at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy and all of the graduate programs in Arts &amp; Sciences and Engineering. While the majority of the campus is in Medford, the Somerville line intersects it, placing parts of the lower campus in Somerville and leading to the common terms &quot;Uphill&quot; and &quot;Downhill&quot;.

The &quot;Uphill&quot; portion of the campus comprises the academic and the residential &quot;Rez&quot; quad (built on the former reservoir site) and is enclosed by a wrought-iron fence. Classes that contributed to the building of the fence are commemorated along its length. The academic quad contains the earliest buildings and was primarily built from the middle of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century. One of Tufts&#x27; first buildings, Ballou Hall was constructed from 1852 to 1854 and was designed in the Italianate style by the well-known Boston architect Gridley James Fox Bryant. Ballou Hall was later restored by McKim, Mead, and White in 1955–56, and houses the offices of the president, the provost, and several vice presidents and deans. Other notable buildings include: Packard Hall (1856), East Hall (1860), West Hall (1871), Goddard Chapel (1882), Goddard Hall (1883), Barnum Hall (1884), and Eaton Hall (1908). The New York firm Whitfield &amp; King was responsible for the design of Eaton Hall.The &quot;Uphill&quot; residential quad contains more modern buildings. The most notable building is Carmichael Hall (1954), designed by Arland A. Dirlam. Dirlam also designed Bendetson Hall (1947) on the academic quad. Adjacent to both quads is the Cabot Intercultural Center designed by ARC/Architectural Resources Cambridge, Inc. one of the Fletcher School&#x27;s buildings. Many points on the hill have noted views of the Boston skyline, particularly the patio on the Tisch Library roof. It has been ranked one of the prettiest college campuses in the United States.The &quot;Uphill&quot; portion can be accessed with the memorial stairs. Designed by the Olmsted Brothers in the 1920s, the memorial stairs form one of the main entrances to the university and allows direct access to the engineering school from the academic quad. The engineering school is part of the Tufts&#x27;s &quot;Downhill&quot; portion of campus. Notable buildings around the engineering school include Bromfield-Pearson Hall (1893), Robinson Hall (1899), and Curtis Hall (1894). Boston architect George Albert Clough is responsible for the design of Curtis Hall and Goddard Hall. Additionally, Arland Dirlam is responsible for the designs of many buildings downhill. These include Cohen Auditorium (1950), Hodgdon Hall (1954), and Jackson Gymnasium (1947). Other notable buildings downhill include the Mayer Campus Center and the Dewick Macphie Dining Hall. Administrative offices also occupy the surrounding neighborhoods and nearby Davis Square, where Tufts makes payments in lieu of taxes on some of its tax-exempt (educational) properties.

===Boston===
The School of Medicine, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, School of Dental Medicine, and the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy are located on the Tufts Boston Health Science campus in the Chinatown neighborhood of Boston, adjacent to Tufts Medical Center, a 451-bed academic medical institution. All full-time Tufts Medical Center physicians hold clinical faculty appointments at Tufts School of Medicine.

The School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts University (SMFA) is located on the Tufts Boston Fine Arts campus in the Fenway neighborhood of Boston, next door to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. The late-2022 opening of the Green Line Extension of the MBTA Green Line E branch light rail transit route offers a one-seat direct connection between the SMFA and the main campus of Tufts University in Medford.

===Grafton===
The Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine is located in Grafton, Massachusetts, west of Boston, on a campus. The school also maintains the Ambulatory Farm Clinic in Woodstock, Connecticut and the Tufts Laboratory at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole on Cape Cod.

===Talloires===

Tufts has a satellite campus in Talloires, France at the Tufts European Center, a former Benedictine priory built in the 11th century. The priory was purchased in 1958 by Donald MacJannet and his wife Charlotte and used as a summer camp site for several years before the MacJannets gave the campus to Tufts in 1978.

Each year the center hosts a number of summer study programs, and enrolled students live with local families. The Tufts Summit Program is for American high school students during the month of July. Tufts in Talloires is a 6-week program for Tufts undergraduates that extends from the middle of May until the end of June. Additionally, Tufts in Annecy is a 4-week program which provides French language learners a chance to practice and learn the language. The site is frequently the host of international conferences and summits, most notably the Talloires Declaration which united 22 universities toward a goal of sustainability. The Talloires campus has been ranked as one of the best branch campuses by the National Association of Branch Campus Administrators.

==Organization and administration==

Tufts University is an independent, privately supported, nonsectarian institution of higher education. Its official corporate name is &quot;The Trustees of Tufts College&quot;. The university is governed by up to forty-one trustees and no fewer than twenty-eight. The board is self-perpetuating, with trustees responsible for choosing their successors. In addition to the president, the university appoints charter trustees (up to 30 members) who are elected by the board and alumni trustees (up to 10 members) who serve for up to five years. Generally, charter trustees are elected by majority vote of the members and alumni trustees are elected by alumni. The officers of the corporation include the chair of the board, three vice chairs, the treasurer, the secretary, the provost, the president, who serves ex officio, and the executive vice president.

The president of Tufts University, who is elected by the trustees, is the chief executive officer of the university. Assisting the president in administering the university are the provost, the executive vice president, the treasurer, and the secretary, all of whom are appointed by the trustees on the nomination of the president and serve at their pleasure. The 14th president, Sunil Kumar, became president on July 1 and was installed in a formal ceremony on October 6, 2023.

Tufts is organized into ten schools. Each school has its own faculty and is led by a dean appointed by the president and the provost with the consent of the board of trustees. The School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Engineering are the only schools that award both undergraduate and graduate degrees. The schools offering undergraduate education are the School of Arts and Sciences (the liberal arts college offering both the Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degree as well as the Bachelor of Fine Arts degree at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts), the School of Engineering (which offers the Bachelor of Science degree), and the School of Special Studies. The Jonathan M. Tisch College of Citizenship and Public Service and the Experimental College are non-degree granting.

The Film and Media Studies program (FMS), formerly known as Communications and Media Studies (CMS), is the university&#x27;s largest interdisciplinary minor program, which offers undergraduate majors and minors in film and media studies. It is affiliated with the Experimental College of Tufts University. Since 1997, FMS has awarded minors to nearly 1,000 students. Additionally, FMS supports student internships for academic credit at various global media companies. FMS also sponsors awards and events, such as The Edward R. Murrow Forum on Issues in Journalism, The Eliot-Pearson Awards for Excellence in Children&#x27;s Media, and the P.T. Barnum Awards for Excellence in Entertainment.

The Tisch College was founded in 2000 &quot;to educate for active citizenship&quot; with the help of a $10 million (~$ in ) gift from eBay founder Pierre Omidyar and his wife Pam. The school was renamed in 2006 after a $40 million (~$ in ) gift from Jonathan Tisch. It has been called the &quot;most ambitious attempt by any research university to make public service part of its core academic mission&quot;. The college facilitates and supports a wide range of community service, civic engagement programs, research, and teaching initiatives across the university. The university runs on a semester-based calendar with most undergraduate students finishing within four years, however, Tisch College provides an innovative 1+4 Bridge year program where students have the opportunity to take a community service-based gap year before starting in Tufts. Current projects undertaken by Bridge Year Fellows involve serving as mentors and teachers to children, caring for rescued wild animals, contributing to renewable energy and sustainability projects. Current projects are based in Brazil, Nicaragua, and Spain.

==Academics==
===Rankings===
In the 2025 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report Best Colleges Ranking&quot;, Tufts ranked 37th in the nation.

&quot;Forbes&quot; ranked the undergraduate school 36th among private colleges in its 2024-25 America&#x27;s Top Colleges ranking, which includes 500 military academies, national universities, and liberal arts colleges. Tufts University is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.

Tufts was named by &quot;Newsweek&quot; as one of the &quot;25 New Ivies&quot; in 2006. In &quot;The Princeton Review&quot; 2010–2011 &quot;Best 363 Colleges&quot;, Tufts was ranked 14th for the happiest students and its study abroad program was ranked third in the country. According to the October 2010 rankings compiled by &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot;, Tufts ranked 12th in the country (tied with both Harvard and Johns Hopkins) with 17 Fulbright scholars. Tufts also ranks fourth among medium-sized schools for the number of Teach for America volunteers it produces. Because of its continual growth as an institution, Tufts was ranked as the fifth &quot;hottest school&quot; of the decade from 2000 to 2010. Tufts was ranked the 450th top college in the United States by Payscale and CollegeNet&#x27;s Social Mobility Index college rankings.

===Admissions===
====Undergraduate admissions====
&quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; names Tufts&#x27; undergraduate admission as &quot;most selective&quot;. For the class of 2027, Tufts admitted 10% of 34,002 applicants. The number of places in the freshmen class is set at approximately 1,600 students. For the class of 2024, the interquartile range of SAT scores was 1420–1550 while for the ACT it was 33–35.

Since 2006 Tufts has incorporated experimental criteria into the application process for undergraduates to test &quot;creativity and other non-academic factors&quot;, including inviting applicants to submit YouTube videos to supplement their application. Calling it the &quot;first major university to try such a departure from the norm&quot;, &quot;Inside Higher Ed&quot; also notes that Tufts continues to consider the SAT and other traditional criteria. Tufts accepts illegal immigrant students with and without Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). Undocumented students are not considered international students, but rather domestic students.

In 1856, shortly after Tufts opened, its admissions application asked for statements of good character and for students to complete examinations in Greek, history, Latin, and mathematics. As part of these examinations, they were asked to study a list of relevant textbooks. By 1905 the admissions requirements became lengthier, and the examinations became more complex; the latter required students to write essays and translations. Julia Ryan of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; wrote that because students certified by the New England College Entrance Certificate Board, ones who attended private preparatory schools in New England, were exempt from the examinations, &quot;perhaps only a few students were even taking [the entrance examinations].&quot; By 1925 Tufts set an admission quota of 650 males; the examinations were of a similar length of the 1905 ones but the entry requirements decreased in size to a level comparable of that of the 1856 ones. Standardized testing, admissions interviews, and other features of current university admissions processes were in place by 1946.

===Collaborations===

Students can pursue a five-year program with the New England Conservatory. The Cosmology department also offers joint seminars with MIT. Organized by Alan Guth and Alexander Vilenkin, the seminars are open to all students. The Fletcher School also operates dual degree programs with Harvard Law School, Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth, and UC Berkeley School of Law, among others. Several academic consortiums allow for research collaboration between local schools. Examples exist with the Program on Negotiation, the ROTC, the Tufts-New England Medical Center, the Center for European Studies, and the School of Engineering. Several exchange programs allow students to study at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva and the Sciences Po in Paris. Cross registration exists for undergraduate students with schools in the Boston Consortium. Fletcher and other graduate students may cross register with the graduate schools at Harvard and MIT.

Tufts has offered study abroad programs with various universities for the past 40 years. Tufts has semester and year long programs with Pembroke College of the University of Oxford, University College London, Royal Holloway University of London, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of Paris, Sciences Po Paris, École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts, University of Tübingen, Zhejiang University, and University of Hong Kong. Every year more than 500 undergraduate students study abroad, with most doing it during their junior and senior years.

===Archives, libraries, and museums===
Completed in 1908, Tufts&#x27; first library building, Eaton Memorial Library (now Eaton Hall), was made possible with a donation from Andrew Carnegie. Carnegie&#x27;s wife requested that the building be named after a Tufts graduate, Reverend Charles Eaton, who had presided over her wedding. The building received an extension in 1950 with the construction of the War Memorial Library in honor of the Tufts alumni who served in World War II. By 1965 the collection outgrew the building and was moved to a new library named Wessell Library. Additionally, the demand for more square footage prompted the expansion of Wessell. In 1995, with the addition of , the library was renamed Tisch Library.

Today the Tufts University Library System contains over three million volumes. The main library, Tisch Library, holds about 2.7 million volumes, with other holdings dispersed at subject libraries including the Hirsh Health Sciences Library on the Boston campus, the Edwin Ginn Library at the Fletcher School, and Webster Family Library at the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine on the Grafton campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tufts University Fact Book 2015/2016&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Students have access to the academic libraries of institutions in the Boston Consortium. Tufts is also a member of SHARES, which allows students to have library access in participating members such as Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Caltech, Dartmouth, Johns Hopkins, Northwestern, Princeton, Stanford, UPenn and Yale. Furthermore, students may apply for privileges to Harvard&#x27;s Library System. Tufts also runs the Perseus Project, a digital library project that assembles digital collections of humanities resources.

In addition to the Barnum Museum of Natural History, Tufts had established a permanent art collection which includes a wide range of art from antiquity to the present. The Collection comprises 2,000 works from ancient Mediterranean and pre-Hispanic cultures to modern and contemporary painting, sculpture, and photography. Notable highlights in the permanent collection include works by John Singer Sargent, Albrecht Dürer, Isamu Noguchi, Auguste Rodin, Andy Warhol, Milton Resnick, Salvador Dalí, and Pablo Picasso among others. Exhibitions of the collection rotate annually in the Aidekman Arts Center.

==Student life==
===Student body===
According to the Princeton Review the undergraduate student body is ethnically and socioeconomically diverse. &quot;The Advocate&quot; ranks Tufts as one of the top 20 gay-friendly campuses. Of those accepted for admission to the undergraduate Class of 2019, 27 percent are Asian, Hispanic, African American, or two or more races. There were 145 international students and 6 DACA students Of domestic students admitted, some 31 percent self-identified as one or more races other than Caucasian, including Asian Americans, African Americans, Hispanic Americans and Native Americans. International students make up 15 percent of the undergraduate student population. Students come from all 50 states and represent 71 countries. The top 10 countries represented are China, Greece, Hong Kong, India, Turkey, Singapore, Canada, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam.

====Student government====
There are three forms of student government at Tufts University: The Tufts Community Union (TCU) Senate, the TCU Judiciary (TCUJ) and the CSL (Committee on Student Life). The Senate is chaired by the student body president and led by a six-person executive board consisting of Vice President, Treasurer, Historian, Parliamentarian, and Diversity and Community Affairs Officer.

====&quot;Deadly Exchange&quot; and accusations of antisemitism====
In 2020, Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) proposed a student referendum on ending the campus police department&#x27;s exchange program with Israeli police forces and military, dubbed by activists as the &quot;Deadly Exchange&quot;. Max Price, a member of TCUJ, a sevenmember group tasked with fact checking and removing bias from student government legislation, said that the proposed referendum and campaign rested on mistruths and needed to be revised before it could be approved for the student ballot. The SJP first demanded his removal from the discussion, and then his impeachment from the TCUJ altogether. Price sought legal assistance, which garnered national attention and resulted in the cancellation of the impeachment hearing. In a report by the Jewish News Syndicate, Price stated that he had been the victim of harassment by the SJP for his Zionist beliefs. In the same article, Price&#x27;s lawyers stated that the Senate of the student governing body had harassed him by making him &quot;sit through meetings by Tufts studentgovernment leadership questioning his personal beliefs and identity as a proIsrael Jew&quot;. 

The SJP, some of whose leading figures are Jewish, reported that its members had faced harassment, threats to publish their identities and &quot;false accusations in the right-wing media&quot; during the intense media attention following Price&#x27;s complaint. The revised referendum on the issue garnered record voter turnout and passed with 68% of the vote, but university administration did not respond to its demands.

In 2021, because of ongoing concerns about antisemitism, the University conducted a campus wide survey of antisemitic incidents at Tufts. The survey found that more than half of Jewish student respondents reported to have observed some form of antisemitism at Tufts. Then Tufts President Monaco said in a statement, &quot;Disturbingly we also heard from some Jewish students who felt that, in order to be welcome in student organizations supporting social justice, they had to hide their Jewish identities.&quot;

====Publications and broadcasting====
The &quot;Tufts Daily&quot; is the daily student newspaper, and the &quot;Tufts Observer&quot;, established in 1895, is the school&#x27;s biweekly magazine and the oldest publication on campus. The Zamboni is Tufts&#x27; monthly humor and satire magazine. &quot;The Princeton Review&quot; has named Tufts&#x27; college newspaper as one of the best in the country, currently ranking it No. 10. Tufts has a television station (TUTV) which has produced and broadcast films, news, soap operas, and comedy sketch pieces. TUTV has also gone to release web series such as &quot;Jules and Monty&quot;. The station went operational in April 1977, from Curtis Hall and consists of 40 student volunteers. Curtis Hall is also home to Tufts&#x27; own radio station WMFO, which streams locally on 91.5 FM. The station first aired in 1970 and is funded by the university. The university publishes its alumni magazine, &quot;Tufts Magazine&quot;, twice per year, as well as four magazines for the university&#x27;s professional schools (&quot;Tufts Nutrition&quot;, &quot;Tufts Dental Medicine&quot;, &quot;Tufts Medicine&quot; and &quot;Tufts Veterinary Medicine&quot;).

====Activism====
In 1969, Tufts was the center for Civil Rights activism due to the controversy surrounding the construction of Lewis Hall. Students staged a work strike to protest racist hiring policies practiced by the construction company Tufts had commissioned to build the residence hall. In addition to writing letters, students sat in Ballou and East Halls, and collaborated with black workers. These demonstrations eventually attracted support from major metropolitan areas in the Northeast. In 1970, Tufts adopted new hiring policies which were subsequently adopted by other universities. It led to the creation of training programs for minority employees on campus, in addition to the foundation of the Africana Center.

====Greek life====
About 18% of the student body is involved in Greek life. There are four fraternities on campus, four sororities, one co-ed independent fraternity, and four active city-wide, multicultural organizations. &quot;Id&quot;.

===Athletics===
Tufts competes in the New England Small College Athletic Conference—the NESCAC—in NCAA Division III. Their mascot is Jumbo, which is one of two college mascots to appear in Webster&#x27;s Dictionary with the other being the Billiken of St. Louis University. The mascot comes from P. T. Barnum&#x27;s circus, as Barnum was one of the original trustees of Tufts College. According to legend, Jumbo the Elephant heroically jumped in front of a train, sacrificing himself to save a younger elephant from dying. Jumbo&#x27;s stuffed skin was donated to the school and was displayed until a 1975 fire destroyed the body, except for the tail, which had been removed for conservation work. Now, a statue of the elephant is a prominent landmark on the quad, near Barnum Hall, the Biology building. Some of Jumbo&#x27;s ashes were recovered in a peanut butter jar that has remained in the athletics director&#x27;s office where students continue to rub it for good luck.

Recently, Tufts has become one of the top athletic schools in Division III. The school has consistently ranked in the top ten of the Learfield Director&#x27;s Cup, which ranks the top Division I, II, and III athletic programs in the country by awarding points in a pre-determined number of sports for men and women. In 2022, Tufts won the Learfield Director&#x27;s Cup. In 2015–16, Tufts ranked 4th in the country, and in 2014–15 Tufts ranked 9th. Tufts men&#x27;s lacrosse team won the school&#x27;s first ever NCAA team championship in 2010, beating Salisbury State University in the championship game. They lost in 2011 to Salisbury in the championship. In 2012, the women&#x27;s field hockey team won their first national championship, beating Montclair State University 2–1 in the finals. Coach Tina McDavitt won DIII National Coach of the Year in 2012, as well. The field hockey team had previously been national runners-up in 2008. The women&#x27;s softball team won three consecutive NCAA Division III National Championships in 2013, 2014 and 2015. The men&#x27;s lacrosse team won their second NCAA Division III National Championship in 2014 and their third Championship in 2015, beating Lynchburg. On December 6, 2014, the men&#x27;s soccer team won its first-ever DIII National Championship, defeating Wheaton College 4–2. The Jumbos repeated this feat two years later, winning the DIII National Championship in 2016 by defeating Calvin College 1–0. The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s squash teams have been historically successful, ranking within the top 30 teams in the nation. The Men&#x27;s Varsity Swim and Dive team won the first NESCAC Championship in school history in 2018 and the team placed 7th in the nation at the National Championship meet that same year.

Performed at most football games, &quot;Tuftonia&#x27;s Day&quot;, the Tufts fight song, was written in 1912 by Elliot W. Hayes. It can also be heard at Tufts&#x27; numerous a capella concerts and at homecoming.

In 2024, twenty-four students who participated in a Tufts University men’s lacrosse team workout developed rhabdomyolysis, also known as rhabdo.

==Traditions==
===A Cappella===
Tufts maintains a capella groups, including the Beelzebubs, which has performed on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Sing-Off&quot; and &quot;Glee&quot;, where the group arranged several of the songs performed by the fictional a cappella group The Warblers. Other groups include the Amalgamates and the Jackson Jills, Tufts&#x27; oldest female group.

===Naked Quad Run===
Every winter just prior to final exams, students would run naked laps on the Academic Quad as a way to relieve the stress of finals, much akin to similar traditions such as the Primal Scream at Harvard. Due to increasing scrutiny from the administration and injuries incurred by slipping on the icy roads, the tradition was banned in 2011 by then-President Lawrence Bacow, much to students&#x27; dismay. A protest run took place the following year, with some students donning nude colored leotards and others taking the opposite tack calling their event the &quot;Excessively Overdressed Quad Stroll&quot;. Starting in 2016, the tradition was revitalized for spring finals week and briefly became an annual tradition once more. The run has not regained popularity since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, though in 2022, the administration reminded students that the run violated the Student Code of Conduct, Sexual Misconduct Policy, and local laws. Several students informally organized a nighttime run in underwear in response.

<doc id="84078" wikidata="Q599900" url="?curid=84078" title="List of rulers in Wales">
<text>This is a list of rulers in Wales (; and neighbouring regions) during the Middle Ages, between . The rulers were monarchs who ruled their respective realms, as well as those who briefly ruled the Principality of Wales. These former territories are now within the boundaries of modern-day Wales and the neighbouring Welsh Marches in England (both in the United Kingdom).

Before the Conquest of Wales, completed in 1283, Wales consisted of several independent realms, the most important being Gwynedd, Powys, Deheubarth (originally Ceredigion, Seisyllwg and Dyfed) and Morgannwg (Glywysing and Gwent). Boundary changes and the custom of dividing patrimonies between heirs meant that few princes ever came close to ruling the whole of Wales.

The names of those known to have ruled over one or more areas are listed below. Boundaries changed frequently. The only person known to have ruled all of Wales as a modern territory was Gruffydd ap Llywelyn (c. 1010–1063), a Prince of Gwynedd who became King of Wales from 1055 to 1063. However, some Welsh Princes sporadically claimed the medieval title of &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; between the 13th to 15th centuries. The title remains in use but is usually given to heir apparents of English and British monarchs.

== History of the medieval kingdoms in Wales ==
Wales during the medieval age was a land of kingdoms and dynasties. Petty kingdoms, such as Ceredigion and Gwent, were established some time after Britain ceased to be part of the Roman empire in the late 5th century. By the time of the Norman invasion of Wales in the 11th century, most of these realms were combined or incorporated into greater territories, thus making up the four major Kingdoms of Wales. Those Kingdoms were Gwynedd, Powys, Deheubarth, and Morgannwg. Unlike the others, Deheubarth was formed later by the merging of Ceredigion, Dyfed, and Ystrad Tywi. Some minor (petty) kingdoms stayed independent from the big four kingdoms, only to be taken over by the Anglo-Normans in the 13th century, such as Rhwng Gwy a Hafren, and Meirionnydd, and others.

<text>Demetrius II (Greek: Δημήτριος, &quot;Demetrios;&quot; 275 - 229 BC), also known as Demetrius Aetolicus, was king of the Ancient Greek kingdom of Macedonia from 239 until his death in 229 BC.

==Biography==
Demetrius was born in either 275 or 274 BC and was the only child of King Antigonus II Gonatas by Phila, the daughter of Seleucus I. He had an elder half-brother named Halcyoneus, but he died in an unknown battle sometime before the death of Antigonus in 239 BC. He had already distinguished himself during his father&#x27;s lifetime by defeating Alexander II of Epirus at Derdia and so saving Macedonia There is a possibilitythat his father had already elevated him to position of power equal to his own before his death. If this had occurred it would be in 256 or 257 BC.

On his accession, Demetrius faced a coalition of enemies which included the two great leagues. Usually rivals, the Aetolian and Achaean Leagues now became allies against the Macedonian power. He succeeded in dealing this coalition severe blows, wresting Boeotia from their alliance. The revolution in Epirus, which substituted a republican league for the monarchy, gravely weakened his position.

During his reign, his kingdom extended into Euboea, Magnesia, Thessaly and its environs, excluding Dolopia and possibly Peparethos and Achaea Phthiotis.

In 236 BC, he invaded Boeotia, making the Boeotians submit immediately.

In 234 BC, due to a federal republic replacing the monarchy in Epirus, which led to the events of 231 BC, Demetrius hired Agron for military aid against the advancing Aetolians. His kingdom was not threatened by the Illyrian Ardiaei, ruled by Agron, despite them having gathered the greatest force in their history ( 231 BC), but Epirus needed some sort of force to deter them.

At some point in 230–229 BC in an unknown location in north-west Macedonia, the Dardani defeated Demetrius who died shortly the next spring at the age of 45. His nine year old successor, the future Philip V, was deemed too young to rule by the Macedonian nobility and so Demetrius&#x27; half-cousin, Antigonus III Doson, was made regent. The exact location of Demetrius&#x27; tomb remains unknown, but was likely in Beroea or Aegae.

==Marriage and family==
Demetrius married four times, though the chronology of these marriages is a matter of dispute.

* Stratonice of Macedon, his aunt/cousin, the daughter of the Seleucid king Antiochus I and his aunt Stratonice, by whom he had a daughter called Apama III who married Prusias I of Bithynia. Stratonice left him after he married his second wife.
* Nicaea, the widow of his cousin Alexander of Corinth, 245/244 BC.
* Phthia (239 BC), daughter of Alexander II of Epirus, and possibly the mother of Philip V of Macedon (Chryseis has also been suggested as his mother).
* Chryseis, probably a former war prisoner turned concubine, whom he married around 237 BC. After Demetrius&#x27; death, she married his successor, Antigonus.

Information regarding the life of Demetrius is drawn mainly from inscriptions, as only Plutarch writes of him, in Life of Aratus, and Polybius makes scarce mention of him.

<text>Brookfield is a town in Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States, situated within the southern foothills of the Berkshire Mountains. The population was 17,528 at the 2020 census. The town is located northeast of New York City, making it part of the New York-Newark, NY-NJ-CT-PA combined statistical area. The town is part of the Western Connecticut Planning Region. In July 2013, &quot;Money&quot; magazine ranked Brookfield the 26th-best place to live in the United States, and the best place to live in Connecticut.

Colonists settled in what is now known as Brookfield in 1710, led by John Muirwood and other colonial founders including Hawley, Peck and Merwin. They bartered for the land from the Wyantenuck and the Potatuck Nations who were ruled under the Sachems Waramaug and Pocono. Sachem Pocono&#x27;s village was in an enormous palisade along the Still River. Colonists first established the area as the Parish of Newbury, incorporating parts of neighboring Newtown and Danbury. The parish later was renamed and incorporated as the town of Brookfield in 1788, named for Rev. Thomas Brooks, the first minister of the parish&#x27;s Congregational church.

==History==

Early people who lived in Brookfield were subsistence farmers, gatherers, and hunters. The main food sources were corn, beans, squash and wild foods found in the rocky, heavily forested foothills of the Berkshire Mountains of Brookfield and New Milford. Such wild foods that were harvested were white oak acorns, American chestnuts, shag bark hickory nuts, may apples, beach nuts and Solomon&#x27;s seal. The hunted animals that were taken from the forest and rivers were deer, passenger pigeon, turkey, bass, trout, crawfish, squirrel, rabbit and others. In the 18th century the community was called &quot;Newbury&quot;, a name that came from the three towns from which its land was taken—New Milford, Newtown, and Danbury.

As traveling to surrounding churches was difficult in winter, in 1752 the General Assembly granted the community the right to worship in area homes from September through March. In 1754, the General Assembly granted permission for the Parish of Newbury to build its own meeting house and recruit its own minister. On September 28, 1757, the first Congregational Church building was dedicated. The Reverend Thomas Brooks was ordained as the first settled minister. When incorporated in 1778, the town&#x27;s name was changed to Brookfield in honor of Brooks, who was still the minister.

Along the Still River, mills were in operation as early as 1732 in an area that became known as the Iron Works District. Brookfield was a thriving town with iron furnaces, grist mills, sawmills, comb shops, carding and cotton mills, a paper mill, a knife factory, hat factories, stage-coach shops, lime kilns, harness shops and other plants in operation. The grist mill still stands, as the Brookfield Craft Center. The Iron Works Aqueduct Company, formed in 1837 to supply water from mountain springs to the Iron Works District, still supplies water as the Brookfield Water Company.

Before 1912, the town had two train stations: one in the Iron Works District near the present Brookfield Market and a second, Junction Station, near the corner of Junction Road and Stony Hill Road.

The Danbury &amp; Bethel Gas and Electric Company brought electricity to Brookfield in 1915. The .475 Wildey Magnum gun, later made famous in the 1985 Charles Bronson movie &quot;Death Wish 3&quot;, was developed by Wildey J. Moore in Brookfield in the early 1970s (the factory has since moved to Warren, Connecticut).

In the early 1970s, the town was home to the headquarters of Lego USA.

Throughout the 1970s and late 20th century, Brookfield saw a massive influx in its population. This is attributed to New Yorkers who began relocating from the city to the suburbs. This created rapid real estate development in Brookfield, and turned Brookfield into a popular commuter town for those who work in and around New York City. The top professions of residents today are in the fields of professional, scientific, and technical services, health care, and finance and insurance. As of 2022, 88.7% of residents in the workforce hold white-collar jobs, and about 20% work remotely full-time.

The Board of Finance approves financial measures, including the town budget; the Board of Education controls the town&#x27;s public schools; the Representative Town Meeting is the main legislative body of the town. The three selectmen are elected on a town-wide basis, although each person can only vote for two members. This assures that there will almost always be one Democrat and two Republicans or two Democrats and one Republican. Many of the town committees have equal representation between Democrats and Republicans, regardless of the vote breakdown, since each individual can only vote for half as many seats as are available.

==Downtown redevelopment project==
For years, despite being a major economic center for retail in Fairfield County, Brookfield had lacked a walkable downtown area. Most of the large economic activity was centered on the southern portion of Federal Road near Danbury. In 2016, construction began on a project known as &quot;Brookfield Village&quot;, which will create a downtown district consisting of sidewalks, a pocket park, street lamps, and parallel parking. Dozens of retail storefronts and residential apartment buildings (more than 150 units) are also being developed in this area, which has gained attention from retailers and will promote further development in the area. In conjunction with other retail developments on Federal Road and with the completion of Phase I of the newly revitalized district, many new restaurants, stores and boutiques have recently opened in the Town Center District.

The current library was constructed in 1975, and is 9,600 square feet. At this time, the former &quot;Joyce Memorial Library&quot; was renamed &quot;The Brookfield Library&quot;. Several proposals have been made to construct a new library in Brookfield, due to the significant increase in population since 1975 when the current facility was constructed. In 2002, the Library Board of Trustees began the planning stage for a new library, and in 2009, a one million dollar state grant was awarded for the construction of a new library. A referendum was held in February 2018 over whether or not to begin construction on a 36,000 square foot library at a cost of 14.7 million dollars, although the motion did not pass. The Library Committee is now revising the plan, with hopes to bring a revised plan to referendum.

==Rankings==

Known as an affluent Fairfield County suburb, Brookfield has regularly placed high in various rankings. Brookfield was selected as the best small town in Connecticut by &quot;Money&quot; magazine in 2013. It was selected as the 26th best town to live in nationwide by &quot;Money.com&quot; in 2013. In 2017, &quot;MarketWatch&quot; ranked the Greater Danbury area as the 10th most expensive place to raise a family in the United States. Brookfield Public Schools are frequently ranked as one of the best school districts in Connecticut. Brookfield is also frequently ranked as one of the safest towns in Connecticut, due to its extremely low crime rates. In 2015, &quot;Connecticut Magazine&quot; rated Brookfield as one of the best among towns in Connecticut with median home values over $325,000. The rating considers education, crime, economy, community engagement, and culture/leisure.

==Notable people==

Partially due to Brookfield&#x27;s close proximity to New York City, Brookfield has seen many notable residents ranging from famous golfer Gene Sarazen to Connecticut&#x27;s 87th governor Jodi Rell. Many finance and business executives also reside in Brookfield, due to the centralization of investment firms and hedge funds in Fairfield County, as well as many &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 companies.

==In popular culture==
*In the 2010 film &quot;All Good Things&quot;, starring Ryan Gosling and Kirsten Dunst, several scenes used a Brookfield lake house on Lake Lillinonah as the set.
*The 2021 movie &quot;The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It&quot; is based on the 1981 trial of Arne Cheyenne Johnson. This was the first murder case in all of Brookfield&#x27;s history.
*Scenes from the 1968 movie &quot;Rachel, Rachel&quot; were filmed in Brookfield.
*The 1988–1989 TV series &quot;Michaels&#x27; Movie Madness&quot; was shot in Brookfield.
*The short film &quot;Innocence&quot; was mostly filmed in Brookfield.
*In the 1941 film &quot;The Lady Eve&quot;, starring Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck, Fonda&#x27;s character hosts lavish parties in a fictional town called Bridgefield, Connecticut, right outside of New York.

==Transportation==
===Highways===
Interstate 84 and U.S. Route 7 are the main highways in Brookfield. From the South, US 7 and US 202 jointly exit Interstate 84 at Exit 7 near Danbury. To the South, US 7 connects to the Merritt Parkway and Interstate 95 in Norwalk. US 202 then splits from US 7 at Exit 11, and runs parallel north through town before reconnecting with US 7 near the New Milford border. For many years, US 7 and US 202 ran concurrently through Brookfield but, after decades of discussion and planning, the US 7 Bypass officially opened in November 2009. The Governor of Connecticut at the time was Jodi Rell (R), a Brookfield resident.

Connecticut Route 133 connects Brookfield to its eastern neighbor Bridgewater over the iconic Southville Bridge, which spans the Housatonic River. Connecticut Route 25 also connects Brookfield with Newtown and its Hawleyville neighborhood to the southeast, passing by Interstate 84 and terminating at US 6. Interstate 84 passes through the southern tip of Brookfield, but is most directly accessible through Exit 9 in Hawleyville.

Brookfield is located along U.S. Bicycle Route 7, which runs from Norwalk, Connecticut, to the border between Vermont and Quebec.

===Buses===
The town is part of the &quot;4 Route&quot;, &quot;7 Route&quot; and &quot;New Milford Loop&quot;, which are operated by Housatonic Area Regional Transit (HART). A park and ride is located at 67 White Turkey Road Ext., and offers connections to nearby bus and train stations as well as nearby airports. HART operates a direct shuttle for commuters between the park and ride and Brewster station from 5 AM to 10 PM on weekdays.

===Railroad===

Until 1971, the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad (later the Penn Central Railroad) operated commuter service between Grand Central Terminal and Pittsfield, Massachusetts, which included a stop in Brookfield. Brookfield&#x27;s station building is currently occupied by the Brookfield Craft Center, which ceased to operate as a station in 1971 when service ended. There was also a station on Stony Hill Road known as Brookfield Junction, which closed in 1925.

Proposals have been made to extend the New Haven Line&#x27;s Danbury Branch to New Milford, which would include a Brookfield Metro-North station. The Danbury Branch provides commuter rail service between Danbury, to South Norwalk, Stamford, and Grand Central Terminal in New York City. The tracks north of Danbury are currently used by the Housatonic Railroad for freight service. This extension would give Brookfield&#x27;s significant population of commuters another way to travel to Lower Fairfield County and New York City, since they must currently leave from the nearby Danbury station or other stations along the New Haven or Harlem Lines, such as Brewster station (located 12 miles from Brookfield).

===Airports===
The closest public airport to Brookfield is Danbury Municipal Airport, being located in neighboring Danbury. Brookfield is within close proximity of several airports with commercial service, including Westchester County Airport, Bradley International Airport, Tweed New Haven Airport and NYC airports of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

==Emergency services==
===Fire Department and EMS===
The town of Brookfield has two volunteer fire companies in town staffing three stations, with the headquarters for the Brookfield Volunteer Fire Company being at 92 Pocono Rd, the Center Company at 6 Obtuse Hill Rd and the Brookfield Volunteer Fire Department Candlewood Company at 18 Bayview Dr. The department was founded in 1934, and is composed entirely of volunteers.

===Police Department===

The Brookfield Police Department Headquarters is located at 63 Silvermine Rd, adjacent to the Brookfield Municipal Center. The department was established on July 1, 1977, and as of 2017, consists of 34 full-time officers, 6 special officers and 12 full and part-time civilian personnel. The Department Command Staff consists of the chief of police, a major and a captain. There is a Patrol Division, a Detective Division, including a youth officer and two school resource officers, and part-time SCUBA Team, Accident Investigation Team, tactical response technicians with the Danbury Police Department, and part-time evidence technicians. Brookfield has plans to expand the current police headquarters, citing a growth in the population served, as well as the size of the police force.

==Media==
*WINE-AM 940; 1,000 watts; CBS Sports Radio affiliated station
*WRKI-FM 95.1; 50,000 watts; the station has a &quot;mainstream rock&quot; format and covers Fairfield, Litchfield, New Haven counties in Connecticut and Putnam, Dutchess, Westchester counties in New York
*&quot;The News-Times&quot; is the most prominent newspaper serving the Greater Danbury area, and reports on local news in Brookfield.&quot;The Brookfield Daily Voice&quot; and &quot;The Brookfield Patch&quot; are the two most prominent local online newspapers.
*Brookfield&#x27;s public-access channels are channels 162 (education) and 164 (community), and are made available by Charter Spectrum.

<text>Demetrius I Soter (, &quot;Dēmḗtrios ho Sōtḗr,&quot; &quot;Demetrius the Saviour&quot;; 185 – June 150 BC) reigned as king of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire from November 162 to June 150 BC. Demetrius grew up in Rome as a hostage, but returned to Greek Syria and overthrew his young cousin Antiochus V Eupator and regent Lysias. Demetrius took control during a turbulent time of the Empire, and spent much of his time fighting off revolts and challenges to his power from threats such as Timarchus and Alexander Balas.

==Biography==
===Early confinement and escape===
Demetrius was born around 185 BC. He was sent to Rome as a hostage at a young age during the reign of his father Seleucus IV Philopator and his mother Laodice IV. Rome taking prominent Seleucid family members hostage was one of the terms of the Treaty of Apamea that had ended the Roman-Seleucid War. His father was likely murdered by his finance minister Heliodorus in 175 BC; his uncle Antiochus IV Epiphanes overthrew Heliodorus and took the throne himself. While the throne should have gone to Demetrius, he was both too young and also still held as a hostage in Rome. Antiochus IV died around October–November 164 BC while on campaign in Babylonia and Persia. His 9-year-old son Antiochus V Eupator became king, although real power rested in the regent Antiochus IV had left in Antioch, Lysias. Demetrius was then 22 years old. He requested the Roman Senate to restore the Syrian throne to him, but was rejected, since the Romans preferred a weak Syria and would rather it be ruled by a boy rather than a man. Two years later, Antiochus V was greatly weakened because Rome sent an emissary to sink his ships and hamstring his elephants using the terms of the Treaty of Apamea as cause. Demetrius again petitioned the Senate on the grounds that his captivity would do little to inspire Antiochus V to heed Rome, but the appeal was again unsuccessful, as Rome preferred the perceived weak child over him. With the help of the Greek historian Polybius, Demetrius escaped from confinement and made his way to the Seleucid capital Antioch. There he successfully gained the support of the local aristocracy and was welcomed back on the Syrian throne around November 162 BC. He immediately executed Antiochus V and Lysias.

This phase of Demetrius&#x27;s life is unusually well-chronicled, as Polybius was an active participant and advisor to Demetrius, and his book &quot;The Histories&quot; survived out of antiquity rather than being a lost book.

===Reign as King===

The Romans were not enthusiastic about Demetrius&#x27;s new rule. They offered their indirect support and encouragement to any who would seek to divide the Seleucid Empire, and hence weaken it. Notably, this included the satrap Timarchus; the Jewish Maccabees; Ptolemaeus of Commagene; and Artaxias I of Armenia.

In Judea, Demetrius instituted measure to suppress the Maccabean Revolt which were recorded in the books of the Maccabees. Demetrius is recorded as sending a new High Priest to Judea, Alcimus, shortly after his reign started. Alcimus was able to successfully bring back at least some Jews to following the government. Demetrius also dispatched an expedition under Bacchides which broke Maccabee influence over the Judean cities. Bacchides and his forces defeated and killed the rebel leader Judas Maccabaeus at the Battle of Elasa in 160 BC, restoring Seleucid control to the province for a number of years. 

Demetrius acquired his surname of &quot;Soter&quot;, Savior, from the Babylonians, where he defeated the rebellious Median satrap Timarchus. Timarchus, who had distinguished himself by defending Media against the emergent Parthians, seems to have treated Demetrius&#x27; accession as an excuse to declare himself an independent king and extend his realm into Babylonia. His forces were, however, not enough to stand against the new Seleucid king: Demetrius defeated and killed Timarchus in 160 BC, and dethroned Ariarathes, king of Cappadocia. The Seleucid empire was temporarily united again. 

Demetrius may have married his sister Laodice V, by whom he had three sons: Demetrius II Nicator, Antiochus VII Sidetes, and Antigonus.

===Downfall and death===

Demetrius&#x27; downfall may be attributed to Heracleides, a surviving brother of the defeated rebel Timarchus, who championed the cause of Alexander Balas, a boy who claimed to be a natural son of Antiochus IV Epiphanes. Heracleides convinced the Roman Senate to support the young pretender against Demetrius I. Balas&#x27;s mercenary army landed and occupied Ptolemais, and started a reign proclaiming himself as king of the Seleucids in Seleucid year 160 (153–152 BC). The Seleucids now had two kings locked in civil war.

While the Jews were a minor part of Demetrius I&#x27;s empire, their story was unusually well preserved. Jonathan Apphus, the brother of Judas and the new leader of the Maccabees, was able to negotiate a deal with Demetrius I that would allow him to remove some of the Seleucid forces from Judea to use against Balas. However, Jonathan promptly broke his temporary truce with Demetrius after Alexander Balas offered an even better deal to them. Balas allied with Jonathan: he appointed him as High Priest of Judea and &quot;strategos&quot;, and Jonathan agreed to send Jewish troops to support Balas&#x27;s cause. Jonathan, who was born of a priestly family but not from Zadok, the high priestly stock, took the title in Tishri, 152 BC. When Demetrius heard of it, he wrote a letter offering more privileges to Jonathan (1 Macc. 10:25-45). Jonathan did not accept the offer, whether from trust in Balas, distrust in Demetrius, belief that Balas was likely to win the civil war, or a combination of all three.

Balas defeated and killed Demetrius I in 150 BC, becoming the sole king of Syria.

==Legacy==
In 1919 Constantine Cavafy published a poem about Demetrius&#x27;s time as a hostage in Rome.

<text>In classical mythology, Hylas () was a youth who served Heracles (Roman Hercules) as companion and servant. His abduction by water nymphs was a theme of ancient art, and has been an enduring subject for Western art in the classical tradition.

== Genealogy ==

In Greek mythology, Hylas was the son of King Theiodamas of the Dryopians and the nymph Menodice, daughter of Orion. In some accounts, his father was Euphemus or King Ceyx of Trachis.

== Mythology ==
=== Heracles ===
After Heracles killed Theiodamas in battle, he took on Hylas as his arms-bearer and taught him to be a warrior. The poet Theocritus (about 300 BC) wrote about the love between Heracles and Hylas:

=== Argonauts ===
Heracles took Hylas with him on the Argo, thus making him one of the Argonauts. Hylas was kidnapped by Naiads of the spring of Pegae in Mysia when they fell in love with him, and he vanished into the water with a cry. His disappearance greatly upset Heracles, who, along with Polyphemus, searched for him for a great length of time. The ship soon set sail without them. According to the Latin &quot;Argonautica&quot; of Valerius Flaccus, they never found Hylas because the latter had fallen in love with the nymphs and remained &quot;to share their power and their love&quot;. In the version told by Apollonios Rhodios, the sea-god Glaucus informs the Argonauts that &quot;a nymph has lost her heart to him and made him her husband&quot;. Theocritus, on the other hand, has the nymphs shutting his mouth underwater to stifle his screams for Heracles. Antoninus Liberalis says that the nymphs changed him into an echo which again and again echoed back the cries of Heracles.

== Literature ==
The story of Hylas and the nymphs is alluded to in Book 3 of Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;, Canto XII, Stanza 7:

&lt;poem&gt;Or that same daintie lad, which was so deare
To great Alcides, that when as he dyde
He wailed womanlike with many a teare,
And every wood, and every valley wyde
He fild with Hylas name; the Nymphes eke &quot;Hylas&quot; cryde.&lt;/poem&gt;

Hylas is also mentioned in Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s play &quot;Edward II&quot;: &quot;Not Hylas was more mourned for of Hercules / Than thou hast been of me since thy exile&quot; (Act I, Scene I, line 142-3).

Oscar Wilde mentions Hylas at least six times in his published works.
In &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;, Chapter 11: &quot;...and gilded a boy that he might serve at the feast as Ganymede or Hylas.&quot; 
In his sonnet, &quot;Santa Decca&quot;, lamenting the death of gods: &quot;Young Hylas seeks the water-springs no more;&quot; 
In &quot;The Garden of Eros&quot;: &quot;There are the flowers which mourning Herakles / Strewed on the tomb of Hylas&quot;. 
In &quot;Charmides&quot;: 
&lt;poem&gt;Some woodmen saw him lying by the stream
And marvelled much that any lad so beautiful could seem,

Nor deemed him born of mortals, and one said,
 ‘It is young Hylas, that false runaway
Who with a Naiad now would make his bed
 Forgetting Herakles,’&lt;/poem&gt;
In &quot;Canzonet&quot;:
&lt;poem&gt;Hylas is dead,
Nor will he e’er divine
 Those little red
Rose-petalled lips of thine.&lt;/poem&gt;
In &quot;Ravenna&quot;:
&lt;poem&gt;Long time I watched, and surely hoped to see
Some goat-foot Pan ...
Or Hylas mirrored in the perfect stream.&lt;/poem&gt;
And in &quot;De Profundis&quot; Wilde wrote (to Lord Alfred Douglas), &quot;I compare you to Hylas, or Hyacinth, Jonquil or Narcisse, or someone whom the great god of Poetry favoured, and honoured with his love.&quot;

Hylas is referred to in Chapter 18 of Charles Kingsley&#x27;s novel &quot;Hypatia&quot;, when the Prefect Orontes, rescued by the Goths, is taken for safety into a house largely populated by women, and fancies himself as &quot;A second Hylas&quot;.

&quot;Hylas&quot; is a poem by Madison Cawein, including the lines &quot;Hylas, the Argonaut, the lad Beloved of Herakles, was I&quot;

Hylas is the name of one of the two characters in George Berkeley&#x27;s &quot;Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous&quot;. He represents the materialist position against which Berkeley (through Philonous) argues. In this context, the name is derived from ὕλη, the classical Greek word for &quot;matter.&quot; Stanisław Lem adopted these characters in his 1957 non-fiction, philosophical book &quot;Dialogi&quot; (&quot;Dialogues&quot;).

Hylas is also mentioned in Thomas Hardy&#x27;s &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot;: &quot;He called again: the valleys and farthest hills resounded as when the sailors invoked the lost Hylas on the Mysian shore; but no sheep.&quot;

== Cinema ==
Hylas is a character in &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot; (1963), played by John Cairney.

&quot;Hylas und die Nymphen&quot; (Switzerland, 2013) is an 11-minute short, based on the myth: &quot;The body of a young man (Kai Albrecht) floats in a lily pond. Three young female suspects (Annina Euling, Lina Hoppe, Magdalena Neuhaus) are found and interrogated - the nymphs of our generation.&quot;

&quot;Hylas&quot; (USA, 2021) is a four-minute horror short with Benito Borjas-Fitzpatrick as Hylas and Dan O&#x27;Reilly as a Naiad.

<doc id="84083" wikidata="Q727897" url="?curid=84083" title="Gruffudd ap Llywelyn">
<text>Gruffudd ap Llywelyn ( – 5 August 1063) was the first and only Welsh king to unite all of Wales under his rule from 1055 to 1063. He had also previously been King of Gwynedd and Powys from 1039 to 1055. Gruffudd was the son of Llywelyn ap Seisyll, King of Gwynedd, and Angharad, daughter of Maredudd ab Owain, King of Deheubarth, and the great-great-grandson of Hywel Dda. After his death, Wales was again divided into separate kingdoms.

== Genealogy and early life ==
Gruffudd was the son of Llywelyn ap Seisyll, who had been able to rule both Gwynedd and Powys, and of Angharad ferch Maredudd. On Llywelyn&#x27;s death in 1023, a member of the House of Aberffraw, Iago ab Idwal ap Meurig, became ruler of Gwynedd and began his rise to power in Powys.

== King of Gwynedd and Powys (1039–1055) ==
In 1039, Iago, King of Gwynedd, was killed (supposedly by his own men), his son Cynan was forced into exile in Dublin, and Gruffudd was made King. Soon after gaining power, he surprised a Mercian army at Rhyd y Groes near Welshpool and defeated it, killing Edwin, brother of Leofric, Earl of Mercia. He then attacked Dyfed, which his father had ruled but which was now under Hywel ab Edwin. Gruffudd again defeated Hywel in the Battle of Pencader in 1041 (halfway between Carmarthen and Lampeter but did not win entirely until 1042 at &quot;Pwlldyfach&quot; (near Carmarthen) and carried off Hywel&#x27;s wife. Gruffudd seems to have been able to drive Hywel (and his Irish fleet of &quot;Black Gentiles / Pagans&quot;) out of the south, for in 1044 Hywel is again recorded returning to the River Towy with a fleet from Ireland; Gruffudd, however, defeated and killed Hywel.

Gruffudd ap Rhydderch of Gwent was able to expel Gruffudd ap Llywelyn from Deheubarth in 1047 and became King of Deheubarth himself. Afterwards the nobles of Ystrad Tywi had attacked and killed 140 of Gruffudd ap Llywelyn&#x27;s household guards, Gruffudd exacted his revenge in Towy and Dyfed. Gruffudd ap Llywelyn was active on the Welsh border in 1052 when he attacked Herefordshire with an army consisting of a fleet of 18 ships from Ireland; they defeated a mixed force of Normans and Anglo-Saxons in the Battle of Leominster.

== Ruler of all Wales (1055–1063) ==
According to &quot;Brut y Tywysogion&quot;, Sweyn Godwinson was called in to help Gruffudd&#x27;s brother Rhys against Gruffudd ap Rhydderch in 1045 to keep hold of Deheubarth. Gruffudd raided Leominster in 1052, resulting in the Battle of Llanllieni, the Welsh fighting against Normans and Anglo-Saxons.

In 1055 Gruffudd ap Llywelyn killed his rival Gruffudd ap Rhydderch in battle and recaptured Deheubarth. Gruffudd allied himself with Ælfgar, son of Leofric, Earl of Mercia, who had been deprived of his earldom of East Anglia by Harold Godwinson and his brothers. They marched on Hereford and were opposed by a force led by the Earl of Hereford, Ralph the Timid, then set Hereford on fire. This force was mounted and armed in the Norman fashion, but on 24 October 1055 Gruffudd and Ælfgar defeated it. They then sacked the city and destroyed its motte-and-bailey castle. Earl Harold was given the task of counter-attacking, but Gruffudd and Ælfgar had retreated to 
South Wales whilst Harold ventured no further than Hereford. He seems here to have built a fortification at Longtown in Herefordshire before refortifying Hereford. Shortly afterwards, Ælfgar was restored to his earldom and a peace treaty concluded.

Around this time Gruffudd was also able to seize Morgannwg and Gwent, along with extensive territories along the border with England.

The historian John Davies stated that Gruffudd was

:&quot;The only Welsh king ever to rule over the entire territory of Wales... Thus, from about 1057 until his death in 1063, the whole of Wales recognised the kingship of Gruffudd ap Llywelyn. For about seven brief years, Wales was one, under one ruler, a feat with neither precedent nor successor&quot;.

During this time, between 1053 and 1063, Wales lacked any internal strife and was at peace. The later &quot;Brut y Tywysogion&quot; described him as being &quot;the head and shield of the Britons&quot;. John of Worcester referred to him, several decades later, as &quot;Rex Walensium&quot;, &#x27;King of the Welsh&#x27;.

== Death and aftermath ==
Gruffudd reached an agreement with Edward the Confessor, but the death of his ally Ælfgar in 1062 left him more vulnerable. In late 1062 Harold Godwinson obtained the English king&#x27;s approval for a surprise attack on Gruffudd&#x27;s court at Rhuddlan. Gruffudd was nearly captured, but was warned in time to escape out to sea in one of his ships, though his other ships were destroyed. In the spring of 1063 Harold&#x27;s brother Tostig Godwinson led an army into North Wales while Harold led the fleet first to south Wales and then north to meet his brother&#x27;s army. Gruffudd was forced to take refuge in Snowdonia, where he met his death. Gruffudd&#x27;s head and the figurehead of his ship were sent to Harold. The Ulster Chronicle states that he was killed in 1064 by Cynan, whose father Iago had been put to death by Gruffudd in 1039. Gruffudd had probably made enemies in the course of uniting Wales under his rule. According to Walter Map, Gruffudd said of this:

:&quot;Speak not of killing; I but blunt the horns of the offspring of Wales lest they should injure their dam.&quot;

Following Gruffudd&#x27;s death, Harold married his widow Ealdgyth, who was to be widowed again three years later. Gruffudd&#x27;s realm was divided again into the traditional kingdoms. Bleddyn ap Cynfyn and his brother Rhiwallon came to an agreement with Harold and were given the rule of Gwynedd and Powys. Thus when Harold was defeated and killed at the Battle of Hastings in 1066, the Normans reaching the borders of Wales were confronted by the traditional kingdoms rather than a single king. Gruffudd left two sons who in 1069 challenged Bleddyn and Rhiwallon at the Battle of Mechain in an attempt to win back part of their father&#x27;s kingdom. However, they were defeated, one being killed and the other dying of exposure after the battle.

== Family ==
Gruffudd married Ealdgyth, daughter of Earl Ælfgar of Mercia after he abducted, and married, the wife (name unknown( of Hywel ab Edwin in 1041. Gruffudd had at least three children: two sons called Maredudd and Idwal, both of whom died at the Battle of Mechain in 1069, and a daughter, Nest ferch Gruffudd, who married Osbern fitzRichard of Richard&#x27;s Castle. Their daughter Nest ferch Osbern (Nesta of Hereford) married Bernard de Neufmarché. Gruffudd may have had another son, Owain ap Gruffudd, who died in 1059.

<doc id="84085" wikidata="Q580014" url="?curid=84085" title="Antiochus IV of Commagene">
<text>Gaius Julius Antiochus IV Epiphanes (, before 17 AD – after 72 AD), the last king of Commagene, reigned between 38 and 72 as a client king to the Roman Empire. The epithet &quot;Epiphanes&quot; means &quot;the Glorious&quot;.

==Life==
Antiochus was born a prince of the royal family of Commagene. His parents King Antiochus III of Commagene and Queen Iotapa were full-blooded siblings who had married each other. The younger Antiochus himself would marry his full-blooded sister Iotapa. Antiochus was of Armenian descent. Through his ancestor from Commagene, Queen Laodice VII Thea, who was the mother of King Antiochus I of Commagene, he was a direct descendant of the Greek Seleucid kings.

Antiochus appears to have been very young when his father died in 17. The Roman emperor Tiberius agreed with the citizens of Commagene to make their kingdom a part of the Roman province of Syria. Between 17 and 38, Antiochus seems to have gained Roman citizenship. He lived and was raised in Rome, along with his sister. While he and his sister were growing up in Rome, they were part of the remarkable court of Antonia Minor, a niece of the first Roman emperor Augustus and the youngest daughter of the triumvir Mark Antony. Antonia Minor was a very influential woman and supervised her circle of various princes and princesses. Her circle assisted in the political preservation of the Roman Empire&#x27;s borders and affairs of the client states.

In 38, Antiochus received his paternal dominion from Antonia&#x27;s grandson, the Roman emperor Caligula. In addition, the emperor enlarged Antiochus&#x27; territory with a part of Cilicia bordering on the seacoast. Caligula also gave him the whole amount of the revenues of Commagene during the twenty years that it had been a Roman province. The reasons for providing a client king with such vast resources remain unclear; it was perhaps a stroke of Caligula&#x27;s well-attested eccentricity. Antiochus was on most intimate terms with Caligula, and he and King Agrippa I are spoken of as the instructors of the emperor in the art of tyranny. This friendship, however, did not last very long, for he was subsequently deposed by Caligula.

Antiochus did not regain his kingdom till the accession of Roman Emperor Claudius in 41. In 43 his first son, C. Julius Archelaus Antiochus Epiphanes, was betrothed to Drusilla, a daughter of Agrippa I. Apart from Epiphanes, Antiochus had another two children with Iotapa: Callinicus and a younger Iotapa. In 53, Antiochus put down an insurrection of some barbarous tribes in Cilicia, called Clitae. In 55 he received orders from the Roman emperor Nero to levy troops to make war against the Parthians, and in the year 59 he served under General Cn. Domitius Corbulo against King Tiridates I of Armenia, brother of the Parthian King Vologases I of Parthia. In consequence of his services in this war, in the year 61 he obtained parts of Armenia.

He took the side of Vespasian when the latter was proclaimed Roman emperor in 70; and he is then spoken of as the richest of the tributary kings. In the same year he sent forces, commanded by his son Epiphanes, to assist prince Titus in the siege of Jerusalem. During his reign as king, he founded the following cities: Germanicopolis, Iotapa and Neronias.

Antiochus&#x27; downfall came only two years afterwards, in 72, when he was accused by L. Caesennius Paetus, the governor of Syria, of conspiring with the Parthians against the Romans. He was therefore deprived of his kingdom, after a reign of thirty-four years from his first appointment by Caligula. Antiochus&#x27; sons, the princes Epiphanes and Callinicus, fled to Parthia after a brief encounter with Roman troops. Antiochus himself retired first to Sparta and then to Rome, where he passed the remainder of his life with his sons Epiphanes and Callinicus and was treated with great respect. Among the grandchildren of Antiochus and Iotapa was the prominent Athenian citizen Philopappos who lived in Greece between the 1st and 2nd centuries.

==Coinage==
There are several coins of this king extant, and their die-marks prove he did rule large parts of Cappadocia and Cilicia as well as Commagene proper. In one of those coins he is called ΒΑΣΙΛΕΥΣ ΜΕΓΑΣ ΑΝΤΙΟΧΟΣ (&quot;Great King Antiochus&quot;), a testament to his political ambitions. On the reverse of that coin a scorpion is represented, surrounded with the foliage of the laurel, and inscribed ΚΟΜΜΑΓΗΝΩΝ (&quot;of the Commagenians&quot;). From his coins we also learn the name of his wife, Iotapa.

<doc id="84088" wikidata="Q935433" url="?curid=84088" title="Elpenor">
<text>In Greek mythology, Elpenor (; Ancient Greek: Ἐλπήνωρ, gen.: Ἐλπήνορος), also spelled Elpinor , was the youngest comrade of Odysseus. While on the island of Circe, he became drunk and decided to spend the night on the roof. In the morning he slipped on the ladder, fell, and broke his neck, dying quickly. 

==Mythology==
Elpenor was not especially notable for his intelligence or strength, but he survived the Trojan War, and appears in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. He is the youngest man to survive the Laestrygonians. While Odysseus was staying on Aeaea, Circe&#x27;s island, Elpenor became drunk and climbed onto the roof of Circe&#x27;s palace to sleep. The next morning, waking upon hearing his comrades making preparations to travel to Hades, he forgot he was on the roof and fell, breaking his neck, and died in the act. Odysseus and his men apparently noticed his absence, but they were too busy to look for him. When Odysseus arrived in Hades, Elpenor was the first shade to meet Odysseus, and pleaded with him to return to Aeaea and give him a proper cremation and burial. After finishing his task in the underworld, Odysseus returned to Aeaea and cremated Elpenor&#x27;s body, then buried him with his armour and marked the grave with an oar of his ship.

==Later historic uses==
The story of Elpenor can be described as a mirror to the story of Palinurus in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;. In the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Palinurus, one of Aeneas&#x27; men, falls overboard and ends up swimming to an island nearby. He is killed on the island by the natives that live there. Later on in the story, Aeneas travels to the underworld where he sees Palinurus. There, Palinurus pleads with Aeneas to give him a proper burial.

The story of Elpenor might be the basis of the story of Eutychus in the New Testament.

==Modern uses==
The character of Patrick &quot;Paddy&quot; Dignam, whose funeral is the focus of Episode 6 (&quot;Hades&quot;) of &quot;Ulysses&quot; by James Joyce, is a modern counterpart to Elpenor. This chapter of &quot;Ulysses&quot; is a main inspiration for the film &quot;Bye Bye Braverman&quot;.

Elpenor is the subject of the short novel &quot;Elpénor&quot; by Jean Giraudoux, published in 1919, which retells some of the stories of the &quot;Odyssey&quot; in humorous fashion.

Derek Mahon suggests Elpenor (but does not name him specifically) in his poem &quot;Lives&quot;. Mahon talks of a decaying oar, planted in a beach, thinking of Ithaca. Ezra Pound references Elpenor in his poem Hugh Selwyn Mauberley by having the eponymous poet&#x27;s grave marked by an oar, with an epitaph that recalls Elpenor&#x27;s. Pound also makes use of Elpenor in the first of his Cantos: &quot;But first Elpenor came, our friend Elpenor / Unburied, cast on the wide earth, / Limbs that we left in the house of Circe, / Unwept, unwrapped in sepulchre, since toils urged other.&quot;

Archibald MacLeish wrote a poem about Elpenor published in 1933. Nobel laureate Giorgos Seferis wrote a poem &quot;Sensual Elpenor&quot;. Takis Sinopoulos also wrote a poem called &quot;Elpenor&quot;. Helen Dunmore included a poem &quot;Odysseus to Elpenor&quot; in her last published collection &quot;Inside the Wave&quot;, 2017 Bloodaxe Books Ltd.

The video game &quot;Rock of Ages 3: Make &amp; Break&quot;, has a story mode where Elpenor is the main protagonist, after Odysseus (the traditional hero of Homer&#x27;s epic poem the Odyssey) is flattened by the eponymous Rock of Ages.

<text>A mandala (, ) is a geometric configuration of symbols. In various spiritual traditions, mandalas may be employed for focusing attention of practitioners and adepts, as a spiritual guidance tool, for establishing a sacred space and as an aid to meditation and trance induction. In the Eastern religions of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Shinto it is used as a map representing deities, or especially in the case of Shinto, paradises, kami or actual shrines.

==Hinduism==
In Hinduism, a basic mandala, also called a &quot;yantra&quot;, takes the form of a square with four gates containing a circle with a centre point. Each gate is in the general shape of a T. Mandalas often have radial balance.

A &quot;yantra&quot; is similar to a mandala, usually smaller and using a more limited colour palette. It may be a two- or three-dimensional geometric composition used in &quot;sadhanas&quot;, puja or meditative rituals, and may incorporate a mantra into its design. It is considered to represent the abode of the deity. Each &quot;yantra&quot; is unique and calls the deity into the presence of the practitioner through the elaborate symbolic geometric designs. According to one scholar, &quot;Yantras function as revelatory symbols of cosmic truths and as instructional charts of the spiritual aspect of human experience&quot;

Many situate &quot;yantras&quot; as central focus points for Hindu tantric practice. &quot;Yantras&quot; are not representations, but are lived, experiential, nondual realities. As Khanna describes:
The term &#x27;mandala&#x27; appears in the Rigveda as the name of the sections of the work, and Vedic rituals use mandalas such as the Navagraha mandala to this day. 

For each tantric tradition, its mandala is the most important visual form. Abhinavagupta in his &quot;Tantrāloka&quot; textually describes the four key mandalas of the Trika tradition, which were translated, decoded and illustrated by Christian de Vietri in his book &quot;Trika Maṇḍala Prakāśa&quot;.

==Buddhism==

===Vajrayana===
In Vajrayana Buddhism, mandalas have been developed also into sandpainting. They are also a key part of Anuttarayoga Tantra meditation practices.

====Visualisation of Vajrayana teachings====

The man mandala can be shown to represent in visual form the core essence of the Vajrayana teachings. The mandala represents the nature of the Pure Land, Enlightened mind.

An example of this type of mandala is &quot;Vajrabhairava mandala&quot; a silk tapestry woven with gilded paper depicting lavish elements like crowns and jewelry, which gives a three-dimensional effect to the piece.

=====Mount Meru=====

A mandala can also represent the entire universe, which is traditionally depicted with Mount Meru as the axis mundi in the center, surrounded by the continents. One example is the &quot;Cosmological Mandala with Mount Meru&quot;, a silk tapestry from the Yuan dynasty that serves as a diagram of the Tibetan cosmology, which was given to China from Nepal and Tibet.

=====Wisdom and impermanence=====

In the mandala, the outer circle of fire usually symbolises wisdom. The ring of eight charnel grounds represents the Buddhist exhortation to be always mindful of death, and the impermanence with which &quot;samsara&quot; is suffused: &quot;such locations were utilized in order to confront and to realize the transient nature of life&quot;. Described elsewhere: &quot;within a flaming rainbow nimbus and encircled by a black ring of dorjes, the major outer ring depicts the eight great charnel grounds, to emphasize the dangerous nature of human life&quot;. Inside these rings lie the walls of the mandala palace itself, specifically a place populated by deities and Buddhas.

=====Five Buddhas=====
One well-known type of mandala is the mandala of the &quot;Five Buddhas&quot;, archetypal Buddha forms embodying various aspects of enlightenment. Such Buddhas are depicted depending on the school of Buddhism, and even the specific purpose of the mandala. A common mandala of this type is that of the Five Wisdom Buddhas (a.k.a. Five &quot;Jinas&quot;), the Buddhas Vairocana, Aksobhya, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha and Amoghasiddhi. When paired with another mandala depicting the Five Wisdom Kings, this forms the Mandala of the Two Realms.

====Practice====

Mandalas are commonly used by tantric Buddhists as an aid to meditation.

The mandala is &quot;a support for the meditating person&quot;, something to be repeatedly contemplated to the point of saturation, such that the image of the mandala becomes fully internalised in even the minutest detail and can then be summoned and contemplated at will as a clear and vivid visualized image. With every mandala comes what Tucci calls &quot;its associated liturgy ... contained in texts known as tantras&quot;, instructing practitioners on how the mandala should be drawn, built and visualised, and indicating the mantras to be recited during its ritual use.

By visualizing &quot;pure lands&quot;, one learns to understand experience &quot;itself&quot; as pure, and as the abode of enlightenment. The protection that we need, in this view, is from our own minds, as much as from external sources of confusion. In many tantric mandalas, this aspect of separation and protection from the outer samsaric world is depicted by &quot;the four outer circles: the purifying fire of wisdom, the vajra circle, the circle with the eight tombs, the lotus circle&quot;. The ring of &quot;vajras&quot; forms a connected fence-like arrangement running around the perimeter of the outer mandala circle.

As a meditation on impermanence (a central teaching of Buddhism), after days or weeks of creating the intricate pattern of a sand mandala, the sand is brushed together into a pile and spilled into a body of running water to spread the blessings of the mandala.

Kværne in his extended discussion of sahaja, discusses the relationship of sadhana interiority and exteriority in relation to mandala thus:

====Offerings====
A &quot;mandala offering&quot; in Tibetan Buddhism is a symbolic offering of the entire universe. Every intricate detail of these mandalas is fixed in the tradition and has specific symbolic meanings, often on more than one level.

Whereas the above mandala represents the pure surroundings of a Buddha, this mandala represents the universe. This type of mandala is used for the mandala-offerings, during which one symbolically offers the universe to the Buddhas or to one&#x27;s teacher. Within Vajrayana practice, 100,000 of these mandala offerings (to create merit) can be part of the preliminary practices before a student even begins actual tantric practices. This mandala is generally structured according to the model of the universe as taught in a Buddhist classic text the &quot;Abhidharma-kośa&quot;, with Mount Meru at the centre, surrounded by the continents, oceans and mountains, etc.

=== Theravada Buddhism ===
Various Mandalas are described in many Pali Buddhist texts. Some of the examples of the Theravada Buddhist Mandalas are:

* Mandala of Eight Disciples of Buddha describing the Shakyamuni Buddha at center and Eight great disciple in eight major directions.
* Mandala of Buddhas is the mandala consisting of nine major Buddhas of the past and the present Gautama Buddha occupying the ten directions.
* Mandala of Eight Devis includes the eight Devis occupying and protecting the eight corners of the Universe.

In Sigālovāda Sutta, Buddha describes the relationships of a common lay persons in Mandala style.

===Shingon Buddhism===

One Japanese branch of Mahayana Buddhism – Shingon Buddhism – makes frequent use of mandalas in its rituals as well, though the actual mandalas differ. When Shingon&#x27;s founder, Kūkai, returned from his training in China, he brought back two mandalas that became central to Shingon ritual: the Mandala of the Womb Realm and the Mandala of the Diamond Realm.

These two mandalas are engaged in the &quot;abhiseka&quot; initiation rituals for new Shingon students, more commonly known as the (). A common feature of this ritual is to blindfold the new initiate and to have them throw a flower upon either mandala. Where the flower lands assists in the determination of which tutelary deity the initiate should follow.

=== Nichiren Buddhism ===

The mandala in Nichiren Buddhism is a (), which is a paper hanging scroll or wooden tablet whose inscription consists of Chinese characters and medieval-Sanskrit script representing elements of the Buddha&#x27;s enlightenment, protective Buddhist deities, and certain Buddhist concepts. Called the &quot;Gohonzon&quot;, it was originally inscribed by Nichiren, the founder of this branch of Japanese Buddhism, during the late 13th Century. The &quot;Gohonzon&quot; is the primary object of veneration in some Nichiren schools and the only one in others, which consider it to be the supreme object of worship as the embodiment of the supreme Dharma and Nichiren&#x27;s inner enlightenment. The seven characters Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō, considered to be the name of the supreme Dharma, as well as the invocation that believers chant, are written down the center of all Nichiren-sect &quot;Gohonzons&quot;, whose appearance may otherwise vary depending on the particular school and other factors.

===Pure Land Buddhism===
Mandalas have sometimes been used in Pure Land Buddhism to graphically represent Pure Lands, based on descriptions found in the &quot;Larger Sutra&quot; and the &quot;Contemplation Sutra&quot;. The most famous mandala in Japan is the Taima mandala, dated to about 763 CE. The Taima mandala is based on the &quot;Contemplation Sutra&quot;, but other similar mandalas have been made subsequently. Unlike mandalas used in Vajrayana Buddhism, it is not used as an object of meditation or for esoteric ritual. Instead, it provides a visual representation of the Pure Land texts, and is used as a teaching aid.

Also in Jodo Shinshu Buddhism, Shinran and his descendant, Rennyo, sought a way to create easily accessible objects of reverence for the lower-classes of Japanese society. Shinran designed a mandala using a hanging scroll, and the words of the &quot;nembutsu&quot; () written vertically. This style of mandala is still used by some Jodo Shinshu Buddhists in home altars, or &quot;butsudan&quot;.

=== Bodhimandala ===
Bodhimaṇḍala is a term in Buddhism that means &quot;circle of awakening&quot;.

== Sand mandalas ==
Sand mandalas are colorful mandalas made from sand that are ritualistically destroyed. They originated in India in the 8th–12th century but are now practiced in Tibetan Buddhism. Each mandala is dedicated to specific deities. In Buddhism Deities represent states of the mind to be obtained on the path to enlightenment, the mandala itself is representative of the deity&#x27;s palace which also represents the mind of the deity. Each mandala is a pictorial representation of a tantra. for the process of making Sand mandalas they are created by monks who have trained for three–five years in a monastery. These sand mandalas are made to be destroyed to symbolize impermanence, the Buddhist belief that death is not the end, and that one&#x27;s essence will always return to the elements. It is also related to the belief that one should not become attached to anything. To create these mandalas, the monks first create a sketch, then take colorful sand traditionally made from powdered stones and gems into copper funnels called Cornetts and gently tap sand out of them to create the sand mandala. Each color represents attributes of deities. While making the mandalas the monks will pray and meditate, each grain of sand represents a blessing. Monks will travel to demonstrate this art form to people, often in museums.

==Western psychological interpretations==

The re-introduction of mandalas into modern Western thought is largely credited to psychologist Carl Gustav Jung. In his exploration of the unconscious through art, Jung observed the common appearance of a circle motif across religions and cultures. He hypothesized that the circle drawings reflected the mind&#x27;s inner state at the moment of creation and were a kind of symbolic archetype in the collective unconscious. Familiarity with the philosophical writings of India prompted Jung to adopt the word &quot;mandala&quot; to describe these drawings created by himself and his patients. In his autobiography, Jung wrote:


Jung claimed that the urge to make mandalas emerges during moments of intense personal growth. He further hypothesized their appearance indicated a &quot;profound re-balancing process&quot; is underway in the psyche; the result of the process would be a more complex and better integrated personality. 
American art therapist Joan Kellogg later created the MARI card test, a free response measure, based on Jung&#x27;s work.

Transpersonal psychologist David Fontana proposed that the symbolic nature of a mandala may help one &quot;to access progressively deeper levels of the unconscious, ultimately assisting the meditator to experience a mystical sense of oneness with the ultimate unity from which the cosmos in all its manifold forms arises.&quot;

==In architecture==

Buddhist architecture often applied mandala as the blueprint or plan to design Buddhist structures, including temple complex and stupas. A notable example of mandala in architecture is the 9th century Borobudur in Central Java, Indonesia. It is built as a large stupa surrounded by smaller ones arranged on terraces formed as a stepped pyramid, and when viewed from above, takes the form of a giant tantric Buddhist mandala, simultaneously representing the Buddhist cosmology and the nature of mind. Other temples from the same period that also have mandala plans include Sewu, Plaosan and Prambanan. Similar mandala designs are also observable in Cambodia, Thailand and Myanmar.

==In science==

Circular diagrams are often used in phylogenetics, especially for the graphical representation of phylogenetic relationships. Evolutionary trees often encompass numerous species that are conveniently shown on a circular tree, with images of the species shown on the periphery of a tree. Such diagrams have been called phylogenetic mandalas.

==In art==

Mandala as an art form first appeared in Buddhist art that were produced in India during the first century B.C.E. These can also be seen in Rangoli designs in Indian households.

==In archaeology==

One of the most intense archaeological discoveries in recent years that could redefine the history of eastern thought and tradition of mandala is the discovery of five giant mandalas in the valley of Manipur, India, made with Google Earth imagery. Located in the paddy field in the west of Imphal, the capital of Manipur, the Maklang geoglyph is perhaps the world&#x27;s largest mandala built entirely of mud. The site wasn&#x27;t discovered until 2013 as its whole structure could only be visible via Google Earth satellite imagery. The whole paddy field, locally known as Bihu Loukon, is now protected and announced as historical monument and site by the government of Manipur in the same year. The site is situated 12 km aerial distance from Kangla with the GPS coordinates of 24° 48&#x27; N and 93° 49&#x27; E. It covers a total area of around 224,161.45 square meters. This square mandala has four similar protruding rectangular ‘gates’ in the cardinal directions guarded each by similar but smaller rectangular ‘gates’ on the left and right. Within the square there is an eight petalled flower or rayed-star, recently called as Maklang ‘Star fort’ by the locals, in the centre covering a total area of around 50,836.66 square meters. The discovery of other five giant mandalas in the valley of Manipur is also made with Google Earth. The five giant mandalas, viz., Sekmai mandala, Heikakmapal mandala, Phurju twin mandalas and Sangolmang mandala are located on the western bank of the Iril River. Another two fairly large mandala shaped geoglyph at Nongren and Keinou are also reported from Manipur valley, India, in 2019. They are named as Nongren mandala and Keinou mandala.

==In politics==
The &quot;Rajamandala&quot; (or &quot;Raja-mandala&quot;; circle of states) was formulated by the Indian author Kautilya in his work on politics, the &quot;Arthashastra&quot; (written between 4th century BCE and 2nd century BCE). It describes circles of friendly and enemy states surrounding the king&#x27;s state.

In historical, social and political sense, the term &quot;mandala&quot; is also employed to denote traditional Southeast Asian political formations (such as federation of kingdoms or vassalized states). It was adopted by 20th century Western historians from ancient Indian political discourse as a means of avoiding the term &#x27;state&#x27; in the conventional sense. Not only did Southeast Asian polities not conform to Chinese and European views of a territorially defined state with fixed borders and a bureaucratic apparatus, but they diverged considerably in the opposite direction: the polity was defined by its centre rather than its boundaries, and it could be composed of numerous other tributary polities without undergoing administrative integration. Empires such as Bagan, Ayutthaya, Champa, Khmer, Srivijaya and Majapahit are known as &quot;mandala&quot; in this sense.

==In contemporary use==

Fashion designer Mandali Mendrilla designed an interactive art installation called Mandala of Desires (Blue Lotus Wish Tree) made in peace silk and eco friendly textile ink, displayed at the China Art Museum in Shanghai in November 2015. The pattern of the dress was based on the Goloka Yantra mandala, shaped as a lotus with eight petals. Visitors were invited to place a wish on the sculpture dress, which will be taken to India and offered to a genuine living Wish Tree.

<doc id="84091" wikidata="Q356055" url="?curid=84091" title="Teleplay">
<text>A teleplay is a screenplay or script used in the production of a scripted television program or series. In general usage, the term is most commonly seen in reference to a standalone production, such as a television film, a television play, or an episode of an anthology series. In internal industry usage, however, all television scripts (including episodes of ongoing drama or comedy series) are teleplays, although a &quot;teleplay by&quot; credit may be classified into a &quot;written by&quot; credit depending on the circumstances of its creation.

The term first surfaced during the 1950s, as television was gaining cultural significance, to distinguish teleplays from stage plays written for theater and screenplays written for films. All three have different formats, conventions, and constraints.

==Usage==
According to current Writers Guild of America guidelines, a television script consists of two distinct parts: &quot;story&quot; and &quot;teleplay&quot;. The story comprises &quot;basic narrative, idea, theme or outline indicating character development and action&quot;, while the teleplay consists of &quot;individual scenes and full dialogue or monologue (including narration in connection therewith), and camera set-ups, if required&quot;. Simply put, the script distinguishes the contribution of ideas toward the story from the actual writing of the dialogue and stage directions present on the page in the finished product. 

Accordingly, story and teleplay will appear as distinct credits on a television script if different people played those roles in the script&#x27;s creation; if the same person or people performed both roles equally (unless they also worked on the concept with one or more people not directly involved in writing the script or developing the story concept), then the story and teleplay credits will not be used and instead a merged &quot;written by&quot; credit will be given. However, a &quot;written by&quot; credit may be given to at most only three people; if more than three people were involved, then the credits &quot;must&quot; distinguish those who were &quot;story&quot; contributors from those who were &quot;teleplay&quot; contributors.

== Format and style ==
The format is structured like a traditional screenplay, but it varies with what type of television show the script is written for. It distinguishes interchangeably between a sitcom and a drama series with how the production of the two takes place. Two types of productions being the multi-camera or a single-camera teleplay. 

===Multi-camera teleplay===
Shows that use multi-camera teleplays are typically filmed in front of a live studio audience. Guidelines for these scripts include making all dialogue double-spaced, stage directions being printed in all-caps, and making all the scenes numbered on the top of each page. Unlike in film screenplays where one page can translate to one minute, a page on a teleplay translates to 30 seconds of screen time. Other guidelines include starting each new scene on a new page, as well as making sure each scene includes a list of characters who will appear in a particular scene. Sitcoms are traditionally filmed using a multi-camera setup.

===Single-camera teleplay===
The format of single-camera scripts are written in a &quot;cinematic-style&quot; similar to a film screenplay. The format is written with the dialogue single-spaced, and the stage directions printed in lowercase. But, like Multi-Camera Teleplays, there are act breaks that start a new scene in the next page.

==== Run-time ====
The length or run-time of a show varies for what type of production the script is writing for. Usually, a teleplay can run for 22 minutes or 45 minutes with extra time due to commercials. 

==History==
On the hour-long TV anthology drama shows of the Golden Age of Television, such as &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot;, &quot;The Goodyear Television Playhouse&quot;, &quot;The Philco Television Playhouse&quot;, &quot;The Alcoa Hour&quot;, &quot;Armstrong Circle Theatre&quot;, and &quot;Studio One&quot;, productions often were telecast live from studios with limited scenery and other constraints similar to theatrical presentations. These constraints made a teleplay quite different from a screenplay.

However, television dramatists, such as Paddy Chayefsky, JP Miller and Tad Mosel, turned such limitations to their advantage by writing television plays with intimate situations and family conflicts characterized by naturalistic, slice of life dialogue. When seen live, such productions had a real-time quality not found in films (shot out of sequence), yet they employed tight close-ups, low-key acting and other elements not found in stage productions. For many viewers, this was equivalent to seeing live theater in their living rooms, an effect enhanced when television plays expanded from 60-minute time slots to a 90-minute series with the introduction of &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; in the late 1950s.

Notable examples:
* &quot;The Comedian&quot; (1957)
* &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot; (1958)
* &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; (1956–1960)

<doc id="84096" wikidata="Q168261" url="?curid=84096" title="Ptolemy I Soter">
<text>Ptolemy I Soter (; , &quot;Ptolemaîos Sōtḗr&quot;, &quot;Ptolemy the Savior&quot;; c. 367 BC – January 282 BC) was a Macedonian Greek general, historian, and successor of Alexander the Great who went on to found the Ptolemaic Kingdom centered on Egypt. Ptolemy was &quot;basileus&quot; and pharaoh of Ptolemaic Egypt from 305/304 BC to his death in 282 BC, and his descendants continued to rule Egypt until 30 BC. During their rule, Egypt became a thriving bastion of Hellenistic civilization and Alexandria a great seat of Greek culture.

Ptolemy I was the son of Arsinoe of Macedon by either her husband Lagus or Philip II of Macedon, the father of Alexander. However, the latter is unlikely and may be a myth fabricated to glorify the Ptolemaic Dynasty. Ptolemy was one of Alexander&#x27;s most trusted companions and military officers. After the death of Alexander in 323 BC, Ptolemy retrieved his body as it was en route to be buried in Macedon, placing it in Memphis instead, where it was later moved to Alexandria in a new tomb. Afterwards he joined a coalition against Perdiccas, the royal regent over Philip III of Macedon. The latter invaded Egypt but was assassinated by his own officers in 320 BC, allowing Ptolemy I to consolidate his control over the country. After a series of wars between Alexander&#x27;s successors, Ptolemy gained a claim to Judea in southern Syria, which was disputed with the Seleucid king Seleucus I. He also took control of Cyprus and Cyrenaica, the latter of which was placed under the control of Ptolemy&#x27;s stepson Magas. Ptolemy also commanded the construction of the Library of Alexandria and of the Lighthouse of Alexandria, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.

Ptolemy I may have married Thaïs, his mistress during the life of Alexander; he is known to have married the Persian noblewoman Artakama on Alexander&#x27;s orders. He later married Eurydice, daughter of the Macedonian regent Antipater; their sons Ptolemy Keraunos and Meleager ruled in turn as kings of Macedon. Ptolemy&#x27;s final marriage was to Eurydice&#x27;s cousin and lady-in-waiting, Berenice I. Upon his death, he was succeeded by his son with Berenice, Ptolemy II.

==Early life and career==

Ptolemy was born in 367 BC in the ancient kingdom of Macedon. His mother was Arsinoe. According to Satyrus the Peripatetic, Arsinoe was a descendant of Alexander I of Macedon and thus a member of the Argead dynasty, claiming ultimate descent from Heracles. Ostensibly, Ptolemy&#x27;s father was Lagus, a Macedonian nobleman from Eordaea, but many ancient sources claim that he was actually an illegitimate son of Philip II of Macedon. If true, this would have made Ptolemy the half-brother of Alexander the Great. It is probable that this is a later myth fabricated to glorify the Ptolemaic dynasty. However, through his mother Ptolemy may have been a great-grandson of Amyntas I of Macedon, making him a member of the Argead royal house and a distant relative of Alexander, who was a great-great-grandson of Amyntas.

Ptolemy served with Alexander from his first campaigns, and was among the seven &quot;somatophylakes&quot; (bodyguards) of Alexander. He played a principal part in the later campaigns in Afghanistan and India. He participated in the Battle of Issus, commanding troops on the left wing under the authority of Parmenion. Later he accompanied Alexander during his journey to the Oracle in the Siwa Oasis where he was proclaimed a son of Zeus. Ptolemy had his first independent command during the campaign against the rebel Bessus whom his own guards captured and handed over to Ptolemy, who then handed him over to Alexander for execution.

==Successor of Alexander==

When Alexander died in 323 BC, Ptolemy is said to have instigated the settlement of the empire made at Babylon. Through the Partition of Babylon, he was appointed satrap of Egypt, under the nominal kings Philip III and the infant Alexander IV; the former satrap, the Greek Cleomenes, stayed on as his deputy. Ptolemy quickly moved, without authorization, to subjugate Cyrenaica.

By custom, kings in Macedonia asserted their right to the throne by burying their predecessor. Probably because he wanted to pre-empt Perdiccas, the imperial regent, from staking his claim in this way, Ptolemy took great pains in acquiring the body of Alexander the Great. On his deathbed, Alexander wished to be buried at the Temple of Zeus Ammon in the Siwa Oasis of ancient Libya instead of the royal tombs of Aigai in Macedon. However, his successors including Perdiccas attempted to bury his body in Macedon instead. In late 322 or early 321 BC, Alexander&#x27;s body was in Syria, on its way to Macedon, when it was captured by Ptolemy I. He brought Alexander&#x27;s remains back to Egypt, interring them at Memphis, but they were later moved to Alexandria where a tomb was constructed for them. Shortly after this event, Ptolemy openly joined the coalition against Perdiccas. Perdiccas appears to have suspected Ptolemy of aiming for the throne himself, and may have decided that Ptolemy was his most dangerous rival. Ptolemy executed Cleomenes for spying on behalf of Perdiccas; this removed the chief check on his authority, and allowed Ptolemy to obtain the huge sum that Cleomenes had accumulated.

==Rivalry and wars==

In 321 BC, Perdiccas attempted to invade Egypt, only to fall at the hands of his own men. Ptolemy&#x27;s decision to defend the Nile against Perdiccas ended in fiasco for Perdiccas, with the loss of 2,000 men. This failure was a fatal blow to Perdiccas&#x27; reputation, and he was murdered in his tent by two of his subordinates. Ptolemy immediately crossed the Nile, to provide supplies to what had the day before been an enemy army. Ptolemy was offered the regency in place of Perdiccas, but he declined. Ptolemy was consistent in his policy of securing a power base, while never succumbing to the temptation of risking all to succeed Alexander.

In the long wars that followed between the different Diadochi, Ptolemy&#x27;s first goal was to hold Egypt securely, and his second was to secure control in the outlying areas: Cyrenaica and Cyprus, as well as Syria, including the province of Judea. His first occupation of Syria was in 318, and he established at the same time a protectorate over the petty kings of Cyprus. When Antigonus I, master of Asia in 315, showed expansionist ambitions, Ptolemy joined the coalition against him, and on the outbreak of war, evacuated Syria. In Cyprus, he fought the partisans of Antigonus, and re-conquered the island (313). A revolt in Cyrene was crushed the same year.

In 312, Ptolemy and Seleucus, the fugitive satrap of Babylonia, both invaded Syria, and defeated Demetrius I, the son of Antigonus, in the Battle of Gaza. Again he occupied Syria, and again—after only a few months, when Demetrius had won a battle over his general, and Antigonus entered Syria in force—he evacuated it. In 311, a peace was concluded between the combatants. Soon after this, the surviving 13-year-old king, Alexander IV, was murdered in Macedonia on the orders of Cassander, leaving the satrap of Egypt absolutely his own master.

The peace did not last long, early in 310 he was informed that his ally Nicocles of Paphos was planning to defect to Antigonus; he sent some agents, who together with his brother Menelaus, who was still on Cyprus with an army, dealt with the situation, they surrounded Nicocles palace and forced him to commit suicide. In 309 Ptolemy personally commanded a fleet which detached the coastal towns of Phaselis, Xanthos, Kaunos, Iasos and Myndus in Lycia and Caria from Antigonus, then crossed into Greece, where he took possession of Corinth, Sicyon and Megara (308 BC). In 306, a great fleet under Demetrius attacked Cyprus, and Ptolemy&#x27;s brother Menelaus was defeated and captured in another decisive Battle of Salamis. Ptolemy&#x27;s complete loss of Cyprus followed.

The satraps Antigonus and Demetrius now each assumed the title of king; Ptolemy, as well as Cassander, Lysimachus and Seleucus I Nicator, responded by doing the same. In the winter of 306 BC, Antigonus tried to follow up his victory in Cyprus by invading Egypt; but Ptolemy was strongest there, and successfully held the frontier against him. Ptolemy led no further overseas expeditions against Antigonus. However, he did send great assistance to Rhodes when it was besieged by Demetrius (305/304). The Rhodians granted divine honors to Ptolemy as a result of the lifting of the siege.

When the coalition against Antigonus was renewed in 302, Ptolemy joined it, and invaded Syria a third time, while Antigonus was engaged with Lysimachus in Asia Minor. On hearing a report that Antigonus had won a decisive victory there, he once again evacuated Syria. But when the news came that Antigonus had been defeated and slain by Lysimachus and Seleucus at the Battle of Ipsus in 301, he occupied Syria a fourth time.

The other members of the coalition had assigned all Syria to Seleucus, after what they regarded as Ptolemy&#x27;s desertion, and for the next hundred years, the question of the ownership of southern Syria (i.e., Judea) produced recurring warfare between the Seleucid and Ptolemaic dynasties. Henceforth, Ptolemy seems to have involved himself as little as possible in the rivalries between Asia Minor and Greece; he lost what he held in Greece, but reconquered Cyprus in 295/294. Cyrenaica, after a series of rebellions, was finally subjugated in about 300 and placed under his stepson Magas.

==Marriages, children, and succession==
While Alexander was alive, Ptolemy had three children with his mistress Thaïs, who may also have been his wife: Lagus; Leontiscus; and Eirene, who was given in marriage to Eunostos of Soloi in Cyprus. During the Susa weddings, Ptolemy married Persian noblewoman Artakama, as ordered by Alexander the Great. Around 322 BC, he married Eurydice, daughter of Antipater, regent of Macedonia. They had five children before she was repudiated: three sons–Ptolemy Ceraunus, king of Macedon from 281 BC to 279 BC; his brother and successor Meleager, who ruled for two months in 279 BC; and a &#x27;rebel in Cyprus&#x27; who was put to death by his half-brother Ptolemy II–as well as the daughters Ptolemais, who married Demetrius I of Macedon, and Lysandra, first married to Alexander V of Macedon and after to Lysimachus&#x27; son Agathocles. Ptolemy married once more to Berenice, Eurydice&#x27;s cousin, who had come to Egypt as Eurydice&#x27;s lady-in-waiting with the children from her first marriage to Philip. Their children were Arsinoe II, Philotera, and Ptolemy II. Their eldest child Arsinoe married Lysimachus, then her half-brother Ptolemy Keraunos, and finally her full brother Ptolemy II.

In 285, Ptolemy made his son Ptolemy II his co-regent. His eldest legitimate son, Ptolemy Keraunos, fled to the court of Lysimachus. Ptolemy I died in January 282 aged 84 or 85. Shrewd and cautious, he had a compact and well-ordered realm to show at the end of forty years of war. His reputation for good nature and liberality attached the floating soldier-class of Macedonians and other Greeks to his service, and was not insignificant; nor did he wholly neglect conciliation of the natives. He was a ready patron of letters, founding the Great Library of Alexandria. The Ptolemaic dynasty which he founded ruled Egypt for nearly three hundred years. It was a Hellenistic kingdom known for its capital Alexandria, which became a center of Greek culture. Ptolemaic rule ended with the death of Cleopatra VII in 30 BC.

==Historian==
Ptolemy himself wrote an eyewitness history of Alexander&#x27;s campaigns (now lost). In the second century AD, Ptolemy&#x27;s history was used by Arrian of Nicomedia as one of his two main primary sources (alongside the history of Aristobulus of Cassandreia) for his own extant &quot;Anabasis&quot; of Alexander, and hence large parts of Ptolemy&#x27;s history can be assumed to survive in paraphrase or précis in Arrian&#x27;s work. Arrian cites Ptolemy by name on only a few occasions, but it is likely that large stretches of Arrian&#x27;s &quot;Anabasis&quot; reflect Ptolemy&#x27;s version of events. Arrian once names Ptolemy as the author &quot;whom I chiefly follow&quot;, and in his Preface writes that Ptolemy seemed to him to be a particularly trustworthy source, &quot;not only because he was present with Alexander on campaign, but also because he was himself a king, and hence lying would be more dishonourable for him than for anyone else&quot;.

Ptolemy&#x27;s lost history was long considered an objective work, distinguished by its straightforward honesty and sobriety, but more recent work has called this assessment into question. R. M. Errington argued that Ptolemy&#x27;s history was characterised by persistent bias and self-aggrandisement, and by systematic blackening of the reputation of Perdiccas, one of Ptolemy&#x27;s chief dynastic rivals after Alexander&#x27;s death. For example, Arrian&#x27;s account of the fall of Thebes in 335 BC (&quot;Anabasis&quot; , a rare section of narrative explicitly attributed to Ptolemy by Arrian) shows several significant variations from the parallel account preserved in Diodorus Siculus (17.11–12), most notably in attributing a distinctly unheroic role in proceedings to Perdiccas. More recently, J. Roisman has argued that the case for Ptolemy&#x27;s blackening of Perdiccas and others has been much exaggerated.

==Euclid==
Ptolemy personally sponsored the great mathematician Euclid. He found Euclid&#x27;s seminal work, the &quot;Elements&quot;, too difficult to study, so he asked if there were an easier way to master it. According to Proclus, Euclid famously quipped: &quot;Sire, there is no Royal Road to geometry.&quot;

<text>Ptolemy II Philadelphus (, &quot;Ptolemaîos Philádelphos&quot;, &quot;Ptolemy, sibling-lover&quot;; 309 – 28 January 246 BC) was the pharaoh of Ptolemaic Egypt from 284 to 246 BC. He was the son of Ptolemy I, the Macedonian Greek general of Alexander the Great who founded the Ptolemaic Kingdom after the death of Alexander, and Queen Berenice I, originally from Macedon.

During Ptolemy II&#x27;s reign, the material and literary splendour of the Alexandrian court was at its height. He promoted the Museum and Library of Alexandria. In addition to Egypt, Ptolemy&#x27;s empire encompassed much of the Aegean and Levant. He pursued an aggressive and expansionist foreign policy with mixed success. From 275 to 271 BC, he led the Ptolemaic Kingdom against the rival Seleucid Empire in the First Syrian War and extended Ptolemaic power into Cilicia and Caria, but lost control of Cyrenaica after the defection of his half-brother Magas. In the Chremonidean War (–261 BC), Ptolemy confronted Antigonid Macedonia for control of the Aegean and suffered serious setbacks. This was followed by a Second Syrian War (260–253 BC) against the Seleucid empire, in which many of the gains from the first war were lost.

==Early life==

Ptolemy II was the son of Ptolemy I and his third wife, Berenice I. He was born on the island of Kos in 309/308 BC, during his father&#x27;s invasion of the Aegean in the Fourth Diadoch War. He had two full sisters, Arsinoe II and Philotera. Ptolemy was educated by a number of the most distinguished intellectuals of the age, including Philitas of Cos and Strato of Lampsacus.

Ptolemy II had numerous half-siblings. Two of his father&#x27;s sons by his previous marriage to Eurydice, Ptolemy Keraunos and Meleager, became kings of Macedonia. The children by his mother Berenice&#x27;s first marriage to Philip included Magas of Cyrene and Antigone, the wife of Pyrrhus of Epirus.

At Ptolemy II&#x27;s birth, his older half-brother Ptolemy Keraunos was the heir presumptive. As Ptolemy II grew older a struggle for the succession developed between them, which culminated in Ptolemy Keraunos&#x27; departure from Egypt around 287 BC. On 28 March 284 BC, Ptolemy I had Ptolemy II declared king, formally elevating him to the status of co-regent.

In contemporary documents, Ptolemy is usually referred to as &quot;King Ptolemy son of Ptolemy&quot; to distinguish him from his father. The co-regency between Ptolemy II and his father continued until the latter&#x27;s death in April–June 282 BC. One ancient account claims that Ptolemy II murdered his father, but other sources say that he died of old age, which is more likely given that he was in his mid-eighties.

==Reign==
===Arsinoe I and Arsinoe II===
The fall-out from the succession conflict between Ptolemy II and Ptolemy Keraunos continued even after Ptolemy II&#x27;s accession. The conflict was probably the reason why Ptolemy executed two of his brothers, probably full brothers of Keraunos, in 281 BC. Keraunos himself had gone to the court of Lysimachus, who ruled Thrace and western Asia Minor following his expulsion from Egypt. Lysimachus&#x27; court was divided on the question of supporting Keraunos. On the one hand, Lysimachus himself had been married to Ptolemy II&#x27;s full sister, Arsinoe II, since 300 BC. On the other hand, Lysimachus&#x27; heir, Agathocles, was married to Keraunos&#x27; full sister Lysandra. Lysimachus chose to support Ptolemy II and sealed that decision at some point between 284 and 281 BC by marrying his daughter Arsinoe I to Ptolemy II.

Continued conflict over the issue within his kingdom led to the execution of Agathocles and the collapse of Lysimachus&#x27; kingdom in 281 BC. Around 279 BC, Arsinoe II returned to Egypt, where she clashed with her sister-in-law Arsinoe I. Some time after 275 BC, Arsinoe I was charged with conspiracy and exiled to Coptos. Probably in 273/2 BC, Ptolemy married his older sister, Arsinoe II. As a result, both were given the epithet &quot;Philadelphoi&quot; ( &quot;Sibling-lovers&quot;). While sibling-marriage conformed to the traditional practice of the Egyptian pharaohs, it was shocking to the Greeks, who considered it incestuous. Sotades, a poet who mocked the marriage, was exiled and assassinated. The marriage may not have been consummated, since it produced no children. Another poet Theocritus defended the marriage by comparing it to the marriage of the gods Zeus and his older sister Hera. The marriage provided a model which was followed by most subsequent Ptolemaic monarchs.

The three children of Arsinoe I, who included the future Ptolemy III, seem to have been removed from the succession after their mother&#x27;s fall. Ptolemy II seems to have adopted Arsinoe II&#x27;s son by Lysimachus, also named Ptolemy, as his heir, eventually promoting him to co-regent in 267 BC, the year after Arsinoe II&#x27;s death. He retained that position until his rebellion in 259 BC. Around the time of the rebellion, Ptolemy II legitimised the children of Arsinoe I by having them posthumously adopted by Arsinoe II.

===Conflict with Seleucids and Cyrene (281–275 BC)===

Ptolemy I had originally supported the establishment of his friend Seleucus I as ruler of Mesopotamia, but relations had cooled after the Battle of Ipsos in 301 BC, when both kings claimed Syria. At that time, Ptolemy I had occupied the southern portion of the region, Coele Syria, up to the Eleutherus river, while Seleucus established control over the territory north of that point. As long as the two kings lived, this dispute did not lead to war, but with the death of Ptolemy I in 282 and of Seleucus I in 281 BC that changed.

Seleucus I&#x27;s son Antiochus I spent several years fighting to re-establish control over his father&#x27;s empire. Ptolemy II took advantage of this to expand his realm at Seleucid expense. The acquisitions of the Ptolemaic kingdom at this time can be traced in epigraphic sources and seem to include Samos, Miletus, Caria, Lycia, Pamphylia, and perhaps Cilicia. Antiochus I acquiesced to these losses in 279 BC, but began to build up his forces for a rematch.

Antiochus did this by pursuing ties with Ptolemy II&#x27;s maternal half-brother, Magas, who had been governor of Cyrenaica since around 300 BC and had declared himself king of Cyrene sometime after Ptolemy I&#x27;s death. Around 275 BC Antiochus entered into an alliance with Magas by marrying his daughter Apama to him. Shortly thereafter, Magas invaded Egypt, marching on Alexandria, but he was forced to turn back when Libyan nomads launched an attack on Cyrene. At this same moment, Ptolemy&#x27;s own forces were hamstrung. He had hired 4,000 Galatian mercenaries, but soon after their arrival the Gauls mutinied and so Ptolemy marooned them on a deserted island in the Nile where &quot;they perished at one another&#x27;s hands or by famine.&quot; This victory was celebrated on a grand scale. Several of Ptolemy&#x27;s contemporary kings had fought serious wars against Gallic invasions in Greece and Asia Minor, and Ptolemy presented his own victory as equivalent to theirs.

Around this time Ptolemy was also ostensibly considering some military action in Pre-Islamic Arabia, and so sent Ariston to reconnoiter the western coast of Arabia.

===Invasion of Nubia (c. 275 BC)===
Ptolemy clashed with the kingdom of Nubia, located to the south of Egypt, over the territory known as the Triakontaschoinos (&#x27;thirty-mile land&#x27;). This was the stretch of the Nile river between the First Cataract at Syene and the Second Cataract at Wadi Halfa (the whole area is now submerged under Lake Nasser). The region may have been used by the Nubians as a base for raids on southern Egypt. Around 275 BC, Ptolemaic forces invaded Nubia and annexed the northern twelve miles of this territory, subsequently known as the Dodekaschoinos (&#x27;twelve-mile land&#x27;). The conquest was publicly celebrated in the panegyric court poetry of Theocritus and by the erection of a long list of Nubian districts at the Temple of Isis at Philae, near Syene. The conquered territory included the rich gold mines at Wadi Allaqi, where Ptolemy founded a city called Berenice Panchrysus and instituted a large-scale mining programme. The region&#x27;s gold production was a key contributor to the prosperity and power of the Ptolemaic empire in the third century BC.

===First Syrian War (274–271 BC)===

Probably in response to the alliance with Magas, Ptolemy declared war on Antiochus I in 274 BC by invading Seleucid Syria. After some initial success, Ptolemy&#x27;s forces were defeated in battle by Antiochus and forced to retreat back to Egypt. Invasion was imminent and Ptolemy and Arsinoe spent the winter of 274/3 BC reinforcing the defences in the eastern Nile Delta. However, the expected Seleucid invasion never took place. The Seleucid forces were afflicted by economic problems and an outbreak of plague. In 271 BC, Antiochus abandoned the war and agreed to peace, with a return to the &quot;status quo ante bellum&quot;. This was celebrated in Egypt as a great victory, both in Greek poetry, such as Theocritus&#x27; &quot;Idyll&quot; 17 and by the Egyptian priesthood in the Pithom stele.

===Colonisation of the Red Sea===

Ptolemy revived earlier Egyptian programmes to access the Red Sea. A canal from the Nile near Bubastis to the Gulf of Suez – via Pithom, Lake Timsah and the Bitter Lakes – had been dug by Darius I in the sixth century BC. However, by Ptolemy&#x27;s time it had silted up. He had it cleared and restored to operation in 270/269 BC – an act which is commemorated in the Pithom Stele. The city of Arsinoe was established at the mouth of the canal on the Gulf of Suez. From there, two exploratory missions were sent down the east and west coasts of the Red Sea all the way down to the Bab-el-Mandeb. The leaders of these missions established a chain of 270 harbour bases along the coasts, some of which grew to be important commercial centres.

Along the Egyptian coast, Philotera, Myos Hormos, and Berenice Troglodytica would become important termini of caravan routes running through the Egyptian desert and key ports for the Indian Ocean trade which began to develop over the next three centuries. Even further south was Ptolemais Theron (possibly located near the modern Port Sudan), which was used as a base for capturing elephants. The adults were killed for their ivory, the children were captured to be trained as war elephants.

On the east coast of the sea, the key settlements were Berenice (modern Aqaba/Eilat) and Ampelone (near modern Jeddah). These settlements allowed the Ptolemies access to the western end of the caravan routes of the incense trade, run by the Nabataeans, who became close allies of the Ptolemaic empire.

===Chremonidean War (267–261 BC)===
Throughout the early period of Ptolemy II&#x27;s reign, Egypt was the preeminent naval power in the eastern Mediterranean. The Ptolemaic sphere of power extended over the Cyclades to Samothrace in the northern Aegean. Ptolemaic naval forces even entered the Black Sea, waging a campaign in support of the free city of Byzantion. Ptolemy was able to pursue this interventionist policy without any challenge because a long-running civil war in Macedon had left a power vacuum in the northern Aegean. This vacuum was threatened after Antigonus II firmly established himself as king of Macedon in 272 BC. As Antigonus expanded his power through mainland Greece, Ptolemy II and Arsinoe II positioned themselves as defenders of &#x27;Greek freedom&#x27; from Macedonian aggression. Ptolemy forged alliances with the two most powerful Greek cities, Athens and Sparta.

The Athenian politician Chremonides forged a further alliance with Sparta in 269 BC. In late 268 BC, Chremonides declared war on Antigonus II. The Ptolemaic admiral Patroclus sailed into the Aegean in 267 BC and established a base on the island of Keos. From there, he sailed to Attica in 266 BC. The plan seems to have been for him to rendezvous with the Spartan army and then use their combined forces to isolate and expel the Antigonid garrisons at Sounion and Piraeus which held the Athenians in check. However, the Spartan army was unable to break through to Attica and the plan failed. In 265/4 BC, the Spartan king Areus I once again tried to cross the Isthmus of Corinth and aid the beleaguered Athenians, but Antigonus II concentrated his forces against him and defeated the Spartans, with Areus himself among the dead. After a prolonged siege, the Athenians were forced to surrender to Antigonus in early 261 BC. Chremonides and his brother Glaucon, who were responsible for the Athenian participation in the war, fled to Alexandria, where Ptolemy welcomed them into his court.
Despite the presence of Patroclus and his fleet, it appears that Ptolemy II hesitated to fully commit himself to the conflict in mainland Greece. The reasons for this reluctance are unclear, but it appears that, especially in the last years of the war, Ptolemaic involvement was limited to financial support for the Greek city-states and naval assistance. Gunther Hölbl argues that the Ptolemaic focus was on the eastern Aegean, where naval forces under the command of Ptolemy II&#x27;s nephew and co-regent Ptolemy took control of Ephesus and perhaps Lesbos in 262 BC. The end of Ptolemaic involvement may be related to the Battle of Kos, whose chronology is much disputed by modern scholars. Almost nothing is known about the events of the battle, except that Antigonus II, although outnumbered, led his fleet to defeat Ptolemy&#x27;s unnamed commanders. Some scholars, such as Hans Hauben, argue that Kos belongs to the Chremonidean War and was fought around 262/1 BC, with Patroclus in command of the Ptolemaic fleet. Others, however, place the battle around 255 BC, at the time of the Second Syrian War.

The Chremonidean War and the Battle of Kos marked the end of absolute Ptolemaic thalassocracy in the Aegean. The League of the Islanders, which had been controlled by the Ptolemies and used by them to manage the Cycladic islands seems to have dissolved in the aftermath of the war. However, the conflict did not mean the complete end of the Ptolemaic presence in the Aegean. On the contrary, the naval bases established during the war at Keos and Methana endured until the end of the third century BC, while those at Thera, and Itanos in Crete remained bulwarks of Ptolemaic sea power until 145 BC.

===Second Syrian war (260–253 BC)===
Around 260 BC, war broke out once more between Ptolemy II and the Seleucid realm, now ruled by Antiochus II. The cause of this war seems to have been the two kings&#x27; competing claims to the cities of western Asia Minor, particularly Miletus and Ephesus. Its outbreak seems to be connected to the revolt of Ptolemy II&#x27;s co-regent Ptolemy, who had been leading the Ptolemaic naval forces against Antigonus II. The younger Ptolemy and an associate took control of the Ptolemaic territories in western Asia Minor and the Aegean. Antiochus II took advantage of this upset to declare war on Ptolemy II and he was joined by the Rhodians.

The course of this war is very unclear, with the chronological and causal relationship of events attested at different times and in different theatres being open to debate.
* Between 259 and 255 BC, the Ptolemaic navy, commanded by Chremonides, was defeated in a sea battle at Ephesus. Antiochus II then took control of the Ptolemaic cities in Ionia: Ephesus, Miletus, and Samos. Epigraphic evidence shows that this was complete by 254/3 BC.
* Ptolemy II himself invaded Syria in 257 BC. We do not know what the outcome of this invasion was. At the end of the war, Ptolemy had lost sections of Pamphylia and Cilicia, but none of the Syrian territory south of the Eleutheros River.
* It is possible, but not certain, that Antigonus was still at war with Ptolemy II during this period and that his great naval victory over Ptolemy at the Battle of Kos (mentioned above) took place in 255 BC within the context of the Second Syrian War.

In 253 BC, Ptolemy negotiated a peace treaty, in which he conceded large amounts of territory in Asia Minor to Antiochus. The peace was sealed by Antiochus&#x27; marriage to Ptolemy&#x27;s daughter Berenice, which took place in 252 BC. Ptolemy presented large indemnity payments to the Seleucids as the dowry connected to this wedding.

After the war was over, in July 253 BC Ptolemy travelled to Memphis. There he rewarded his soldiers by distributing large plots of land that had been reclaimed from Lake Moeris in the Fayyum to them as estates (&quot;kleroi&quot;). The area was established as a new nome, named the Arsinoite nome, in honour of the long-dead Arsinoe II.

===Later reign and death (252–246 BC)===
After the Second Syrian War, Ptolemy refocused his attention on the Aegean and mainland Greece. Some time around 250 BC, his forces defeated Antigonus in a naval battle at an uncertain location. In Delos, Ptolemy established a festival, called the &quot;Ptolemaia&quot; in 249 BC, which advertised continued Ptolemaic investment and involvement in the Cyclades, even though political control seems to have been lost by this time. Around the same time, Ptolemy was convinced to pay large subsidies to the Achaean League by their envoy Aratus of Sicyon. The Achaean League was a relatively small collection of minor city-states in the northwestern Peloponnese at this date, but with the help of Ptolemy&#x27;s money, over the next forty years Aratus would expand the League to encompass nearly the whole of the Peloponnese and transform it into a serious threat to Antigonid power in mainland Greece.

Also in the late 250s BC, Ptolemy renewed his efforts to reach a settlement with his brother Magas. It was agreed that Ptolemy II&#x27;s heir, Ptolemy III, would marry Magas&#x27; sole child, Berenice. On Magas&#x27; death in 250 BC, however, Berenice&#x27;s mother Apame refused to honour the agreement and invited an Antigonid prince, Demetrius the Fair, to Cyrene to marry Berenice instead. With Apame&#x27;s help, Demetrius seized control of the city, but he was assassinated by Berenice. A republican government led by two Cyrenaeans named Ecdelus and Demophanes controlled Cyrene until Berenice married Ptolemy III in 246 BC after his accession to the throne.

Ptolemy died on 28 January 246 BC and was succeeded by Ptolemy III without incident.

==Regime==
===Ruler cult===
Ptolemy II was responsible for the transformation of the cult of Alexander the Great which had been established by Ptolemy I into a state cult of the Ptolemaic dynasty. At the start of his sole reign, Ptolemy II deified his father. He deified his mother Berenice I as well after her death in the 270s. The couple were worshipped as a pair, the &quot;Theoi Soteres&quot; (Saviour Gods). Around 272 BC, Ptolemy II promoted himself and his sister-wife Arsinoe II to divine status as the &quot;Theoi Adelphoi&quot; (Sibling Gods).

The eponymous priest of the deified Alexander, who served annually and whose name was used to date all official documents, became the &#x27;Priest of Alexander and the Theoi Adelphoi&#x27;. Each subsequent royal couple would be added to the priest&#x27;s title until the late second century BC. In artistic depictions, Ptolemy II was often depicted with divine attributes, namely the club of Heracles and the elephant-scalp headdress associated with Alexander the Great, while Arsinoe was shown carrying a pair of cornucopiae with a small ram&#x27;s horn behind her ear.

Ptolemy also instituted cults for a number of relatives. Following her death around 269 BC, Arsinoe II was honoured with a separate cult in her own right, with every temple in Egypt required to include a statue of her as a &#x27;temple-sharing deity&#x27; alongside the sanctuary&#x27;s main god. Her cult would prove extremely popular in Egypt throughout the Ptolemaic period. Ptolemy&#x27;s other sister Philotera also received a cult. Even Ptolemy&#x27;s mistress Bilistiche received sanctuaries in which she was identified with the goddess Aphrodite.

A festival, called the &quot;Ptolemaia&quot;, was held in Ptolemy I&#x27;s honour at Alexandria every four years from 279/278 BC. The festival provided an opportunity for Ptolemy II to showcase the splendour, wealth, and reach of the Ptolemaic empire. One of the Ptolemaia festivals from the 270s BC was described by the historian Callixenus of Rhodes and part of his account survives, giving a sense of the enormous scale of the event. The festival included a feast for 130 people in a vast royal pavilion and athletic competitions. The highlight was a Grand Procession, composed on a number of individual processions in honour of each of the gods, beginning with the Morning Star, followed by the &quot;Theoi Soteres&quot;, and culminating with the Evening Star. The procession for Dionysus alone contained dozens of festival floats, each pulled by hundreds of people, including a four-metre high statue of Dionysus himself, several vast wine-sacks and wine krateres, a range of x of mythological or allegorical scenes, many with automata, and hundreds of people dressed in costume as satyrs, sileni, and maenads. Twenty-four chariots drawn by elephants were followed by a procession of lions, leopards, panthers, camels, antelopes, wild asses, ostriches, a bear, a giraffe and a rhinoceros.

Most of the animals were in pairs - as many as eight pairs of ostriches - and although the ordinary chariots were likely led by a single elephant, others which carried a golden statue may have been led by four. At the end of the whole procession marched a military force numbering 57,600 infantry and 23,200 cavalry. Over 2,000 talents were distributed to attendees as largesse.

Although this ruler cult was centred on Alexandria, it was propagated throughout the Ptolemaic empire. The Nesiotic League, which contained the Aegean islands under Ptolemaic control, held its own Ptolemaia festival at Delos from the early 270s BC. Priests and festivals are also attested on Cyprus at Lapethos, at Methymna on Lesbos, on Thera, and possibly at Limyra in Lycia.

===Pharaonic ideology and Egyptian religion===

Ptolemy II followed the example of his father in making an effort to present himself in the guise of a traditional Egyptian pharaoh and to support the Egyptian priestly elite. Two hieroglyphic stelae commemorate Ptolemy&#x27;s activities in this context. The Mendes stele celebrates Ptolemy&#x27;s performance of rituals in honour of the ram god Banebdjedet at Mendes, shortly after his accession. The Pithom stele records the inauguration of a temple at Pithom by Ptolemy, in 279 BC on his royal jubilee. Both stelae record his achievements in terms of traditional Pharaonic virtues. Particularly stressed is the recovery of religious statuary from the Seleucids through military action in 274 BC – a rhetorical claim which cast the Seleucids in the role of earlier national enemies like the Hyksos, Assyrians, and Persians.
As part of his patronage of Egyptian religion and the priestly elite, Ptolemy II financed large-scale building works at temples throughout Egypt. Ptolemy ordered the erection of the core of the Temple of Isis at Philae was erected in his reign and assigned the tax income from the newly conquered Dodekaschoinos region to the temple. Although the temple had existed since the sixth century BC, it was Ptolemy&#x27;s sponsorship that converted it into one of the most important in Egypt.

In addition, Ptolemy initiated work at a number of other sites, including (from north to south):
* Decorative work on the Temple of Anhur-Shu at Sebennytos and the nearby Temple of Isis at Behbeit El Hagar;
* Temple of Horus at Tanis;
* Temple of Arsinoe at Pithom;
* Anubeion in the Serapeum at Saqqara;
* Restoration of the Temple of Min at Akhmin;
* Temple of Min and Isis at Koptos;
* Expansion of the birth house of the Dendera Temple complex; 
* Decorative work on the Temple of Opet at Karnak and the north pylon of the Precinct of Mut at Karnak, Thebes.

===Administration===
Ptolemaic Egypt was administered by a complicated bureaucratic structure. It is possible that much of the structure had already been developed in the reign of Ptolemy I, but evidence for it – chiefly in the form of documentary papyri – only exists from the reign of Ptolemy II. At the top of the hierarchy, in Alexandria, there were a small group of officials, drawn from the king&#x27;s &quot;philoi&quot; (friends). These included the &quot;epistolographos&quot; (&#x27;letter-writer&#x27;, responsible for diplomacy), the &quot;hypomnematographos&quot; (&#x27;memo-writer&#x27; or the chief secretary), the &quot;epi ton prostagmaton&quot; (&#x27;in charge of commands&#x27;, who produced the drafts of royal edicts), the key generals, and the &quot;dioiketes&quot; (&#x27;household manager&#x27;, who was in charge of taxation and provincial administration). The &quot;dioiketes&quot; for most of Ptolemy II&#x27;s reign was Apollonius (262–245 BC). The enormous archive of his personal secretary, Zenon of Kaunos, happens to have survived. As a result, it is the administration of the countryside that is best known to modern scholarship.

The whole of Egypt was divided into thirty-nine districts, called nomes (portions), whose names and borders had remained roughly the same since early Pharaonic times. Within each nome, there were three officials: the nomarch (nome-leader) who was in charge of agricultural production, the oikonomos (household steward) who was in charge of finances, and the (royal secretary), who was in charge of land surveying and record-keeping. All three of these officials answered to the and held equal rank, the idea being that each would act as a check on the others and thus prevent officials from developing regional power bases that might threaten the power of the king. Each village had a (village-leader) and a &quot;komogrammateus&quot; (village-secretary), who reported to the nomarch and the &quot;basilikos grammateus&quot; respectively.

Through this system, a chain of command was created which ran from the king all the way down to each of the three thousand villages of Egypt. Each nome also had its own &quot;strategos&quot; (general), who was in charge of the troops settled in the nome and answered directly to the king.

A key goal of this administrative system was to extract as much wealth as possible from the land, so that it could be deployed for royal purposes, particularly war. It achieved this goal with greatest efficiency under Ptolemy II.

Particular measures to increase efficiency and income are attested from the start of the Second Syrian War. A decree, known as the Revenue Laws Papyrus was issued in 259 BC to increase tax yields. It is one of our key pieces of evidence for the intended operation of the Ptolemaic tax system. The papyrus establishes a regime of tax farming (&quot;telonia&quot;) for wine, fruit, and castor oil.
Private individuals paid the king a lump sum up front for the right to oversee the collection of the taxes (though the actual collection was carried out by royal officials). The tax farmers received any excess from the collected taxes as profit.

This decree was followed in 258 BC by a &#x27;General Inventory&#x27; in which the whole of Egypt was surveyed to determine the quantity of different types of land, irrigation, canals, and forests within the kingdom and the amount of income that could be levied from it. Efforts were made to increase the amount of arable land in Egypt, particularly by reclaiming large amounts of land from Lake Moeris in the Fayyum. Ptolemy distributed this land to the Ptolemaic soldiers as agricultural estates in 253 BC.

The Zenon papyri also record experiments by the &quot;dioiketes&quot; Apollonius to establish cash crop regimes, particularly growing castor oil, with mixed success. In addition to these measures focused on agriculture, Ptolemy II also established extensive gold mining operations, in Nubia at Wadi Allaqi and in the eastern desert at Abu Zawal.
===Scholarship and culture===
Ptolemy II was an eager patron of scholarship, funding the expansion of the Library of Alexandria and patronising scientific research. Poets like Callimachus, Theocritus, Apollonius of Rhodes, and Posidippus were provided with stipends and produced masterpieces of Hellenistic poetry, including panegyrics in honour of the Ptolemaic family. Other scholars operating under Ptolemy&#x27;s aegis included the mathematician Euclid and the astronomer Aristarchus. Ptolemy is thought to have commissioned Manetho to compose his &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot;, an account of Egyptian history, perhaps intended to make Egyptian culture intelligible to its new rulers.

A tradition preserved in the pseudepigraphical Letter of Aristeas presents Ptolemy as the driving force behind the translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek as the Septuagint. This account contains several anachronisms and is unlikely to be true. The Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible is likely to have taken place among the Jews of Alexandria, but the role of Ptolemy II is unclear and only the Pentateuch is likely to have been translated during his reign.

===Relations with the western Mediterranean===
Ptolemy II and King Hiero II of Syracuse are regularly referred to as having enjoyed particularly close relations. There is substantial evidence for the exchange of goods and ideas between Syracuse and Alexandria. Hiero seems to have modelled various aspects of his royal self-representation and perhaps his tax system, the &quot;Lex Hieronica&quot; on Ptolemaic models. Two of the luminaries of Ptolemy II&#x27;s court, the poet Theocritus and the mathematician and engineer Archimedes came from and eventually returned to Syracuse. Numismatic evidence seems to indicate that Ptolemy II funded Hiero II&#x27;s original rise to power – a series of Ptolemaic bronze coins known as the &#x27;Galatian shield without Sigma&#x27; minted between 271 and 265 BC, have been shown to have been minted in Sicily itself, on the basis of their style, flan shape, die axes, weight and find spots. The first set seem to have been minted by a Ptolemaic mint, perhaps left there in 276 BC after Pyrrhus of Epirus&#x27; withdrawal from Sicily. They are succeeded by a series that seems to have been minted by the regular Syracusan mint, perhaps on the outbreak of the First Punic War in 265 BC.

Ptolemy II cultivated good relations with Carthage, in contrast to his father, who seems to have gone to war with them at least once. One reason for this may have been the desire to outflank Magas of Cyrene, who shared a border with the Carthaginian empire at the Altars of Philaeni. Ptolemy was also the first Egyptian ruler to enter into formal relations with the Roman Republic. An embassy from Ptolemy visited the city of Rome in 273 BC and established a relationship of friendship (Latin: &quot;amicitia&quot;). These two friendships were tested in 264 BC, when the First Punic War broke out between Carthage and Rome, but Ptolemy II remained studiously neutral in the conflict, refusing a direct Carthaginian request for financial assistance.

===Relations with India===
Ptolemy is recorded by Pliny the Elder as having sent an ambassador named Dionysius to the Mauryan court at Pataliputra in India, probably to Emperor Ashoka:
&quot;But [India] has been treated of by several other Greek writers who resided at the courts of Indian kings, such, for instance, as Megasthenes, and by Dionysius, who was sent thither by [Ptolemy II] Philadelphus, expressly for the purpose: all of whom have enlarged upon the power and vast resources of these nations.&quot; Pliny the Elder, &quot;The Natural History&quot;, Chap. 21

He is also mentioned by name in the Edicts of the contemporary Indian emperor Ashoka as a recipient of Buddhist proselytism:
==Marriages and issue==
Ptolemy married Arsinoe I, daughter of Lysimachus, between 284 and 281 BC. She was the mother of his legitimate children:

Ptolemy II repudiated Arsinoe I in the 270s BC. Probably in 273 or 272 BC, he married his sister Arsinoe II, widow of Lysimachus. They had no offspring, but in the 260s BC, the children of Ptolemy II and Arsinoe I were legally declared to be Arsinoe II&#x27;s children.

Ptolemy II also had several concubines and mistresses, including Agathoclea (?), Aglais (?) daughter of Megacles, the cup-bearer Cleino, Didyme, the Chian harp player Glauce, the flautist Mnesis, the actress Myrtion, the flautist Pothine and Stratonice. With a woman named Bilistiche he is said to have had an illegitimate son named Ptolemy Andromachou.
