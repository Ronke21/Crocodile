<text>In Euclidean geometry, a kite is a quadrilateral with reflection symmetry across a diagonal. Because of this symmetry, a kite has two equal angles and two pairs of adjacent equal-length sides. Kites are also known as deltoids, but the word &quot;deltoid&quot; may also refer to a deltoid curve, an unrelated geometric object sometimes studied in connection with quadrilaterals. A kite may also be called a dart, particularly if it is not convex.

Every kite is an orthodiagonal quadrilateral (its diagonals are at right angles) and, when convex, a tangential quadrilateral (its sides are tangent to an inscribed circle). The convex kites are exactly the quadrilaterals that are both orthodiagonal and tangential. They include as special cases the right kites, with two opposite right angles; the rhombi, with two diagonal axes of symmetry; and the squares, which are also special cases of both right kites and rhombi.

The quadrilateral with the greatest ratio of perimeter to diameter is a kite, with 60°, 75°, and 150° angles. Kites of two shapes (one convex and one non-convex) form the prototiles of one of the forms of the Penrose tiling. Kites also form the faces of several face-symmetric polyhedra and tessellations, and have been studied in connection with outer billiards, a problem in the advanced mathematics of dynamical systems.

== Definition and classification ==

A kite is a quadrilateral with reflection symmetry across one of its diagonals. Equivalently, it is a quadrilateral whose four sides can be grouped into two pairs of adjacent equal-length sides. A kite can be constructed from the centers and crossing points of any two intersecting circles. Kites as described here may be either convex or concave, although some sources restrict &quot;kite&quot; to mean only convex kites. A quadrilateral is a kite if and only if any one of the following conditions is true:
* The four sides can be split into two pairs of adjacent equal-length sides.
* One diagonal crosses the midpoint of the other diagonal at a right angle, forming its perpendicular bisector. (In the concave case, the line through one of the diagonals bisects the other.)
* One diagonal is a line of symmetry. It divides the quadrilateral into two congruent triangles that are mirror images of each other.
* One diagonal bisects both of the angles at its two ends.
Kite quadrilaterals are named for the wind-blown, flying kites, which often have this shape and which are in turn named for a hovering bird and the sound it makes. According to Olaus Henrici, the name &quot;kite&quot; was given to these shapes by James Joseph Sylvester.

Quadrilaterals can be classified &quot;hierarchically&quot;, meaning that some classes of quadrilaterals include other classes, or &quot;partitionally&quot;, meaning that each quadrilateral is in only one class. Classified hierarchically, kites include the rhombi (quadrilaterals with four equal sides), squares, and Apollonius quadrilaterals (in which the products of opposite sides are equal). All equilateral kites are rhombi, and all equiangular kites are squares. When classified partitionally, rhombi and squares would not be kites, because they belong to a different class of quadrilaterals; similarly, the right kites discussed below would not be kites. The remainder of this article follows a hierarchical classification; rhombi, squares, and right kites are all considered kites. By avoiding the need to consider special cases, this classification can simplify some facts about kites.

Like kites, a parallelogram also has two pairs of equal-length sides, but they are opposite to each other rather than adjacent. Any non-self-crossing quadrilateral that has an axis of symmetry must be either a kite, with a diagonal axis of symmetry; or an isosceles trapezoid, with an axis of symmetry through the midpoints of two sides. These include as special cases the rhombus and the rectangle respectively, and the square, which is a special case of both. The self-crossing quadrilaterals include another class of symmetric quadrilaterals, the antiparallelograms.

== Special cases ==
The right kites have two opposite right angles. The right kites are exactly the kites that are cyclic quadrilaterals, meaning that there is a circle that passes through all their vertices. The cyclic quadrilaterals may equivalently defined as the quadrilaterals in which two opposite angles are supplementary (they add to 180°); if one pair is supplementary the other is as well. Therefore, the right kites are the kites with two opposite supplementary angles, for either of the two opposite pairs of angles. Because right kites circumscribe one circle and are inscribed in another circle, they are bicentric quadrilaterals (actually tricentric, as they also have a third circle externally tangent to the extensions of their sides). If the sizes of an inscribed and a circumscribed circle are fixed, the right kite has the largest area of any quadrilateral trapped between them.

Among all quadrilaterals, the shape that has the greatest ratio of its perimeter to its diameter (maximum distance between any two points) is an equidiagonal kite with angles 60°, 75°, 150°, 75°. Its four vertices lie at the three corners and one of the side midpoints of the Reuleaux triangle. An equidiagonal kite is a special case of a midsquare quadrilateral. When an equidiagonal kite has side lengths less than or equal to its diagonals, like this one or the square, it is one of the quadrilaterals with the greatest ratio of area to diameter.

A kite with three 108° angles and one 36° angle forms the convex hull of the lute of Pythagoras, a fractal made of nested pentagrams. The four sides of this kite lie on four of the sides of a regular pentagon, with a golden triangle glued onto the fifth side.
There are only eight polygons that can tile the plane such that reflecting any tile across any one of its edges produces another tile; this arrangement is called an edge tessellation. One of them is a tiling by a right kite, with 60°, 90°, and 120° angles. It produces the deltoidal trihexagonal tiling (see ). A prototile made by eight of these kites tiles the plane only aperiodically, key to a claimed solution of the einstein problem.

In non-Euclidean geometry, a kite can have three right angles and one non-right angle, forming a special case of a Lambert quadrilateral. The fourth angle is acute in hyperbolic geometry and obtuse in spherical geometry.

== Properties ==
=== Diagonals, angles, and area ===
Every kite is an orthodiagonal quadrilateral, meaning that its two diagonals are at right angles to each other. Moreover, one of the two diagonals (the symmetry axis) is the perpendicular bisector of the other, and is also the angle bisector of the two angles it meets. Because of its symmetry, the other two angles of the kite must be equal. The diagonal symmetry axis of a convex kite divides it into two congruent triangles; the other diagonal divides it into two isosceles triangles.

As is true more generally for any orthodiagonal quadrilateral, the area of a kite may be calculated as half the product of the lengths of the diagonals and :
formula_1
Alternatively, the area can be calculated by dividing the kite into two congruent triangles and applying the SAS formula for their area. If formula_2 and formula_3 are the lengths of two sides of the kite, and formula_4 is the angle between, then the area is
formula_5

=== Inscribed circle ===

Every &quot;convex&quot; kite is also a tangential quadrilateral, a quadrilateral that has an inscribed circle. That is, there exists a circle that is tangent to all four sides. Additionally, if a convex kite is not a rhombus, there is a circle outside the kite that is tangent to the extensions of the four sides; therefore, every convex kite that is not a rhombus is an ex-tangential quadrilateral. The convex kites that are not rhombi are exactly the quadrilaterals that are both tangential and ex-tangential. For every &quot;concave&quot; kite there exist two circles tangent to two of the sides and the extensions of the other two: one is interior to the kite and touches the two sides opposite from the concave angle, while the other circle is exterior to the kite and touches the kite on the two edges incident to the concave angle.

For a convex kite with diagonal lengths and and side lengths and , the radius of the inscribed circle is formula_6
and the radius of the ex-tangential circle is
formula_7

A tangential quadrilateral is also a kite if and only if any one of the following conditions is true:
* The area is one half the product of the diagonals.
* The diagonals are perpendicular. (Thus the kites are exactly the quadrilaterals that are both tangential and orthodiagonal.)
* The two line segments connecting opposite points of tangency have equal length.
* The tangent lengths, distances from a point of tangency to an adjacent vertex of the quadrilateral, are equal at two opposite vertices of the quadrilateral. (At each vertex, there are two adjacent points of tangency, but they are the same distance as each other from the vertex, so each vertex has a single tangent length.)
* The two bimedians, line segments connecting midpoints of opposite edges, have equal length.
* The products of opposite side lengths are equal.
* The center of the incircle lies on a line of symmetry that is also a diagonal.

If the diagonals in a tangential quadrilateral intersect at , and the incircles of triangles }, , , have radii , , , and respectively, then the quadrilateral is a kite if and only if
formula_8
If the excircles to the same four triangles opposite the vertex have radii , , , and respectively, then the quadrilateral is a kite if and only if
formula_9

=== Duality ===

Kites and isosceles trapezoids are dual to each other, meaning that there is a correspondence between them that reverses the dimension of their parts, taking vertices to sides and sides to vertices. From any kite, the inscribed circle is tangent to its four sides at the four vertices of an isosceles trapezoid. For any isosceles trapezoid, tangent lines to the circumscribing circle at its four vertices form the four sides of a kite. This correspondence can also be seen as an example of polar reciprocation, a general method for corresponding points with lines and vice versa given a fixed circle. Although they do not touch the circle, the four vertices of the kite are reciprocal in this sense to the four sides of the isosceles trapezoid. The features of kites and isosceles trapezoids that correspond to each other under this duality are compared in the table below.

=== Dissection ===
The equidissection problem concerns the subdivision of polygons into triangles that all have equal areas. In this context, the &quot;spectrum&quot; of a polygon is the set of numbers formula_10 such that the polygon has an equidissection into formula_10 equal-area triangles. Because of its symmetry, the spectrum of a kite contains all even integers. Certain special kites also contain some odd numbers in their spectra.

Every triangle can be subdivided into three right kites meeting at the center of its inscribed circle. More generally, a method based on circle packing can be used to subdivide any polygon with formula_10 sides into formula_13 kites, meeting edge-to-edge.

== Tilings and polyhedra ==

All kites tile the plane by repeated point reflection around the midpoints of their edges, as do more generally all quadrilaterals. Kites and darts with angles 72°, 72°, 72°, 144° and 36°, 72°, 36°, 216°, respectively, form the prototiles of one version of the Penrose tiling, an aperiodic tiling of the plane discovered by mathematical physicist Roger Penrose. When a kite has angles that, at its apex and one side, sum to formula_14 for some positive integer , then scaled copies of that kite can be used to tile the plane in a fractal rosette in which successively larger rings of formula_10 kites surround a central point. These rosettes can be used to study the phenomenon of inelastic collapse, in which a system of moving particles meeting in inelastic collisions all coalesce at a common point.

A kite with angles 60°, 90°, 120°, 90° can also tile the plane by repeated reflection across its edges; the resulting tessellation, the deltoidal trihexagonal tiling, superposes a tessellation of the plane by regular hexagons and isosceles triangles. The deltoidal icositetrahedron, deltoidal hexecontahedron, and trapezohedron are polyhedra with congruent kite-shaped faces, which can alternatively be thought of as tilings of the sphere by congruent spherical kites. There are infinitely many face-symmetric tilings of the hyperbolic plane by kites. These polyhedra (equivalently, spherical tilings), the square and deltoidal trihexagonal tilings of the Euclidean plane, and some tilings of the hyperbolic plane are shown in the table below, labeled by face configuration (the numbers of neighbors of each of the four vertices of each tile). Some polyhedra and tilings appear twice, under two different face configurations.

The trapezohedra are another family of polyhedra that have congruent kite-shaped faces. In these polyhedra, the edges of one of the two side lengths of the kite meet at two &quot;pole&quot; vertices, while the edges of the other length form an equatorial zigzag path around the polyhedron. They are the dual polyhedra of the uniform antiprisms. A commonly seen example is the pentagonal trapezohedron, used for ten-sided dice.

== Outer billiards ==
Mathematician Richard Schwartz has studied outer billiards on kites. Outer billiards is a dynamical system in which, from a point outside a given compact convex set in the plane, one draws a tangent line to the convex set, travels from the starting point along this line to another point equally far from the point of tangency, and then repeats the same process. It had been open since the 1950s whether any system defined in this way could produce paths that get arbitrarily far from their starting point, and in a 2007 paper Schwartz solved this problem by finding unbounded billiards paths for the kite with angles 72°, 72°, 72°, 144°, the same as the one used in the Penrose tiling. He later wrote a monograph analyzing outer billiards for kite shapes more generally. For this problem, any affine transformation of a kite preserves the dynamical properties of outer billiards on it, and it is possible to transform any kite into a shape where three vertices are at the points and , with the fourth at with in the open unit interval . The behavior of outer billiards on any kite depends strongly on the parameter formula_16 and in particular whether it is rational. For the case of the Penrose kite, , an irrational number, where is the golden ratio.

<text>Choeung Ek (, ) is a former orchard in Dangkao, Phnom Penh, Cambodia, that was used as a Killing Field between 1975 and 1979 by the Khmer Rouge in perpetrating the Cambodian genocide. Situated about south of the city centre, it was attached to the Tuol Sleng detention centre. The bodies of 8,895 victims were exhumed from the site after the fall of the Rouge, who would have been executed there—typically with pickaxes to conserve bullets—before being buried in mass graves.

It is the best-known of the approximately 300 Killing Fields, where the Khmer Rouge regime collectively executed over one million people as part of their Cambodian genocide between 1975 and 1979.

==Description==
Mass graves containing 8,895 bodies were discovered at Choeung Ek after the fall of the Khmer Rouge regime. Many of the dead were former political prisoners who the Khmer Rouge kept in their Tuol Sleng detention center and in other Cambodian detention centers.

Today, Choeung Ek is a memorial, marked by a Buddhist stupa. The stupa has acrylic glass sides and is filled with over 5,000 human skulls. Some lower levels are opened during the day so that the skulls can be seen directly. Many have been shattered or smashed in.

Tourists are encouraged by the Cambodian government to visit Choeung Ek. Apart from the stupa, there are pits from which the bodies were exhumed. Human bones still litter the site.

On 3 May 2005, the Municipality of Phnom Penh announced that they had entered into a 30-year agreement with JC Royal Co. to develop the memorial at Choeung Ek. As part of the agreement, they are not to disturb the remains still present in the field.

==In popular culture==
* The film &quot;The Killing Fields&quot; is a dramatised portrayal of events like those that took place at Choeung Ek.

<doc id="84849" wikidata="Q719252" url="?curid=84849" title="Battle of Antietam">
<text>The Battle of Antietam ( ), also called the Battle of Sharpsburg, particularly in the Southern United States, took place during the American Civil War on September 17, 1862, between Confederate General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia and Union Major General George B. McClellan&#x27;s Army of the Potomac near Sharpsburg, Maryland, and Antietam Creek. Part of the Maryland Campaign, it was the first field army–level engagement in the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War to take place on Union soil. It remains the bloodiest day in American history, with a tally of 22,727 dead, wounded, or missing on both sides. Although the Union Army suffered heavier casualties than the Confederates, the battle was a major turning point in the Union&#x27;s favor.

After pursuing Confederate General Robert E. Lee into Maryland, Major General George B. McClellan of the Union Army launched attacks against Lee&#x27;s army who were in defensive positions behind Antietam Creek. At dawn on September 17, Major General Joseph Hooker&#x27;s corps mounted a powerful assault on Lee&#x27;s left flank. Attacks and counterattacks swept across Miller&#x27;s Cornfield, and fighting swirled around the Dunker Church. Union assaults against the Sunken Road eventually pierced the Confederate center, but the Federal advantage was not followed up. In the afternoon, Union Major General Ambrose Burnside&#x27;s corps entered the action, capturing a stone bridge over Antietam Creek and advancing against the Confederate right. At a crucial moment, Confederate Major General A. P. Hill&#x27;s division arrived from Harpers Ferry and launched a surprise counterattack, driving back Burnside and ending the battle. Although outnumbered two-to-one, Lee committed his entire force, while McClellan sent in less than three-quarters of his army, enabling Lee to fight the Federals to a standstill. During the night, both armies consolidated their lines. In spite of crippling casualties, Lee continued to skirmish with McClellan throughout September 18, while removing his battered army south of the Potomac River.

McClellan successfully turned Lee&#x27;s invasion back, making the battle a strategic Union victory. From a tactical standpoint, the battle was somewhat inconclusive; the Union Army successfully repelled the Confederate invasion but suffered heavier casualties and failed to defeat Lee&#x27;s army outright. President Abraham Lincoln, unhappy with McClellan&#x27;s general pattern of overcaution and his failure to pursue the retreating Lee, relieved McClellan of command in November. Nevertheless, the strategic accomplishment was a significant turning point in the war in favor of the Union due in large part to its political ramifications: the battle&#x27;s result gave Lincoln the political confidence to issue the Emancipation Proclamation. This effectively discouraged the British and French governments from recognizing the Confederacy, as neither power wished to give the appearance of supporting slavery.

==Background==

Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia—about 55,000 men—entered the state of Maryland on September 3, following their victory at Second Bull Run on August 30. Emboldened by success, the Confederate leadership intended to take the war into enemy territory. Lee&#x27;s invasion of Maryland was intended to run simultaneously with an invasion of Kentucky by the armies of Braxton Bragg and Edmund Kirby Smith. It was also necessary for logistical reasons, as northern Virginia&#x27;s farms had been stripped bare of food. Based on events such as the Baltimore riots in the spring of 1861 and the fact that President Lincoln had to pass through the city in disguise en route to his inauguration, Confederate leaders assumed that Maryland would welcome the Confederate forces warmly. They sang the tune &quot;Maryland, My Maryland!&quot; as they marched, but by the fall of 1862 pro-Union sentiment was winning out, especially in the western parts of the state. Civilians generally hid inside their houses as Lee&#x27;s army passed through their towns, or watched in cold silence, while the Army of the Potomac was cheered and encouraged. Some Confederate politicians, including President Jefferson Davis, believed that the prospect of foreign recognition would increase if the Confederacy won a military victory on Union soil; such a victory might gain recognition and financial support from the United Kingdom and France, although there is no evidence that Lee thought the Confederacy should base its military plans on this possibility.

While McClellan&#x27;s 87,000-man Army of the Potomac was moving to intercept Lee, two Union soldiers (Cpl. Barton W. Mitchell and First Sergeant John M. Bloss of the 27th Indiana Volunteer Infantry) discovered a mislaid copy of Lee&#x27;s detailed battle plans—Special Order 191—wrapped around three cigars. The order indicated that Lee had divided his army and dispersed portions geographically (to Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, and Hagerstown, Maryland), thus making each subject to isolation and defeat if McClellan could move quickly enough. McClellan waited about 18 hours before deciding to take advantage of this intelligence and reposition his forces, thus squandering an opportunity to defeat Lee decisively.

There were two significant engagements in the Maryland campaign prior to the major battle of Antietam: Major General Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson&#x27;s capture of Harpers Ferry and McClellan&#x27;s assault through the Blue Ridge Mountains in the Battle of South Mountain. The former was significant because a large portion of Lee&#x27;s army was absent from the start of the battle of Antietam, attending to the surrender of the Union garrison; the latter because stout Confederate defenses at two passes through the mountains delayed McClellan&#x27;s advance enough for Lee to concentrate the remainder of his army at Sharpsburg.

==Opposing forces==
===Union===
Major General George B. McClellan&#x27;s Army of the Potomac, bolstered by units absorbed from John Pope&#x27;s Army of Virginia, included six infantry corps. The I Corps and XII Corps were units from Pope&#x27;s force, the II Corps, V Corps, and VI Corps had fought with McClellan and the Army of the Potomac in the Peninsula campaign, and the IX Corps was a newer addition to the Army of the Potomac. The latter corps had seen action in North Carolina and a portion of it had fought with Pope. The VI Corps contingent included a division from the IV Corps. Earlier in the campaign, McClellan had assigned twenty-four new regiments of inexperienced troops to his army to bolster the strength of depleted veteran units. Of these green troops, eighteen regiments, totaling about 15,000 to 16,000 men, accompanied McClellan&#x27;s army for the march to Antietam. Several thousand more new recruits were added to existing units, so about a quarter of McClellan&#x27;s army was inexperienced and poorly trained entering the battle. The II, IX, and XII Corps received more of these troops than the other corps.

The I Corps was commanded by Major General Joseph Hooker and contained three divisions. The II Corps was commanded by Major General Edwin Vose Sumner, and contained three divisions. As a whole, the veteran elements of the corps had a reputation as a good fighting unit. The V Corps was commanded by Major General Fitz John Porter. Originally only one division of the corps accompanied McClellan, but a second was later released from the defenses of Washington, D.C. to accompany the Army of the Potomac. A third division of the corps reached McClellan the day of the battle. The VI Corps consisted of two divisions and the IV Corps detachment and was commanded by Major General William B. Franklin. These three divisions were positioned about a four-hour march away from McClellan&#x27;s main body at the beginning of the battle. The IX Corps contained four divisions and was nominally commanded by Major General Ambrose Burnside, but Burnside temporarily commanded a wing of McClellan&#x27;s army and active command passed to Major General Jesse Reno until his death at the battle of South Mountain, and then to Brigadier General Jacob D. Cox. The XII Corps was McClellan&#x27;s smallest corps and contained two divisions. It was commanded by Brigadier General Joseph K. F. Mansfield, who took command only two days before the battle. McClellan&#x27;s army also contained a cavalry division commanded by Brigadier General Alfred Pleasonton. A 2023 study by the historian D. Scott Hartwig estimates that McClellan had 72,199 men available for combat on September 17, with roughly 14,000 more arriving as reinforcements. Hartwig places I Corps strength at 9,582; II Corps strength at 16,475; V Corps strength at 9,476 with another 7,000 in the third division; 11,862 men in the VI Corps proper with another 7,219 men in the IV Corps detachment; 12,241 in the IX Corps; 8,020 in the XII Corps; and 4,543 in the Cavalry Division. This force was supported by 293 cannons available for duty.

===Confederate===
General Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia was organized into two large infantry wings, commanded by Major Generals James Longstreet and Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson. Longstreet&#x27;s wing was numerically larger than Jackson&#x27;s. This arrangement was due to Confederate law not allowing the creation of corps. Longstreet&#x27;s wing contained five divisions, led by major generals Lafayette McLaws and Richard H. Anderson and brigadier generals David Rumph Jones, John G. Walker, and John Bell Hood. Jackson&#x27;s wing contained four divisions, commanded by major generals Daniel Harvey (D.H.) Hill and Ambrose Powell (A.P.) Hill, and brigadier generals Alexander R. Lawton and John R. Jones. Lee also had a Cavalry Division commanded by Major General J. E. B. Stuart and a unit of reserve artillery led by Brigadier General William Nelson Pendleton. The assignment of units between the wings of Jackson and Longstreet was flexible; at Antietam the two men commanded sectors of the battlefield and divisions fought under the commander whose geographic area they were fighting in.

The Army of Northern Virginia held morale and leadership advantages over McClellan&#x27;s army, but was poorly supplied, was operating in enemy territory away from its logistical lines, and was more poorly armed. Ammunition supply was made more difficult due to units being armed with mixed types of weapons, and many Confederate soldiers were still armed with smoothbore weapons of shorter range. Many of the cannons issued to the Confederate artillery were obsolete, while the Union had modern guns. The Confederates had about 246 cannon at Antietam, although the exact number of guns issued to some of the Confederate batteries is not known. Lee&#x27;s army was weakened by disease, and the historian Joseph T. Glatthaar estimates that about one-third to one-half of Lee&#x27;s army was absent at Antietam due to straggling. The Confederate strength at Antietam is difficult to determine; Hartwig states that a precise figure is indiscernible, but estimates a strength of about 37,600 men.

==Prelude to battle==

===Disposition of armies===
Near the town of Sharpsburg, Lee deployed his available forces behind Antietam Creek along a low ridge, starting on September 15. While it was an effective defensive position, it was not an impregnable one. The terrain provided excellent cover for infantrymen, with rail and stone fences, outcroppings of limestone, little hollows and . The creek to their front was only a minor barrier, ranging from 60 to 100 feet (18–30 m) in width, and was fordable in places and crossed by three stone bridges each a mile (1.5 km) apart. It was also a precarious position because the Confederate rear was blocked by the Potomac River and only a single crossing point, Boteler&#x27;s Ford at Shepherdstown, was nearby should retreat be necessary. (The ford at Williamsport, Maryland, was northwest from Sharpsburg and had been used by Jackson in his march to Harpers Ferry. The disposition of Union forces during the battle made it impractical to consider retreating in that direction.) And on September 15, the force under Lee&#x27;s immediate command consisted of no more than 18,000 men, only a third the size of the Federal army.

The first two Union divisions arrived on the afternoon of September 15 and the bulk of the remainder of the army late that evening. Although an immediate Union attack on the morning of September 16 would have had an overwhelming advantage in numbers, McClellan&#x27;s trademark caution and his belief that Lee had as many as 100,000 men at Sharpsburg caused him to delay his attack for a day. This gave the Confederates more time to prepare defensive positions and allowed Longstreet&#x27;s corps to arrive from Hagerstown and Jackson&#x27;s corps, minus A.P. Hill&#x27;s division, to arrive from Harpers Ferry. Jackson defended the left (northern) flank, anchored on the Potomac, Longstreet the right (southern) flank, anchored on the Antietam, a line that was about 4 miles (6 km) long. (As the battle progressed and Lee shifted units, these corps boundaries overlapped considerably.)

On the evening of September 16, McClellan ordered Hooker&#x27;s I Corps to cross Antietam Creek and probe the enemy positions. Meade&#x27;s division cautiously attacked Hood&#x27;s troops near the East Woods. After darkness fell, artillery fire continued as McClellan positioned his troops for the next day&#x27;s fighting. McClellan&#x27;s plan was to overwhelm the enemy&#x27;s left flank. He arrived at this decision because of the configuration of bridges over the Antietam. The lower bridge (which would soon be named Burnside Bridge) was dominated by Confederate positions on the bluffs overlooking it. The middle bridge, on the road from Boonsboro, was subject to artillery fire from the heights near Sharpsburg. But the upper bridge was 2 miles (3 km) east of the Confederate guns and could be crossed safely. McClellan planned to commit more than half his army to the assault, starting with two corps, supported by a third, and if necessary a fourth. He intended to launch a simultaneous diversionary attack against the Confederate right with a fifth corps, and he was prepared to strike the center with his reserves if either attack succeeded. The skirmish in the East Woods served to signal McClellan&#x27;s intentions to Lee, who prepared his defenses accordingly. He shifted men to his left flank and sent urgent messages to his two commanders who had not yet arrived on the battlefield: Lafayette McLaws with two divisions and A.P. Hill with one division.

===Terrain and its consequences===
McClellan&#x27;s plans were ill-coordinated and were executed poorly. He issued to each of his subordinate commanders only the orders for his own corps, not general orders describing the entire battle plan. The terrain of the battlefield made it difficult for those commanders to monitor events outside of their sectors. Moreover, McClellan&#x27;s headquarters were more than a mile in the rear (at the Philip Pry house, east of the creek). This made it difficult for him to control the separate corps. This is why the battle progressed the next day as essentially three separate, mostly uncoordinated battles: morning in the northern end of the battlefield, midday in the center, and afternoon in the south. This lack of coordination and concentration of McClellan&#x27;s forces almost completely nullified the two-to-one advantage the Union enjoyed. It also allowed Lee to shift his defensive forces to meet each offensive.

==Battle==

===Morning phase===
====Hooker and Hood attack====

The battle opened at dawn (about 5:30 a.m.) on September 17 with an attack down the Hagerstown Turnpike by the Union I Corps under Joseph Hooker. Hooker&#x27;s objective was the plateau on which sat the Dunker Church, a modest whitewashed building belonging to a congregation of German Baptist Brethren. Hooker had approximately 8,600 men, little more than the 7,700 defenders under Stonewall Jackson, and this slight disparity was more than offset by the Confederates&#x27; strong defensive positions. Abner Doubleday&#x27;s division moved on Hooker&#x27;s right, James Ricketts&#x27;s moved on the left into the East Woods, and George Meade&#x27;s Pennsylvania Reserves division deployed in the center and slightly to the rear. Jackson&#x27;s defense consisted of the divisions under Alexander Lawton and John R. Jones in line from the West Woods, across the Turnpike, and along the southern end of Miller&#x27;s Cornfield. Four brigades were held in reserve inside the West Woods.

As the first Union men emerged from the North Woods and into the Cornfield, an artillery duel erupted. Confederate fire was from the horse artillery batteries under Jeb Stuart to the west and four batteries under Colonel Stephen D. Lee on the high ground across the pike from the Dunker Church to the south. Union return fire was from nine batteries on the ridge behind the North Woods and twenty 20-pounder Parrott rifles, 2 miles (3 km) east of Antietam Creek. The conflagration caused heavy casualties on both sides and was described by Colonel Lee as &quot;artillery Hell.&quot;

Seeing the glint of Confederate bayonets concealed in the Cornfield, Hooker halted his infantry and brought up four batteries of artillery, which fired shell and canister over the heads of the Federal infantry into the field. A battle began, with considerable melee action with rifle butts and bayonets due to short visibility in the corn. Officers rode about cursing and yelling orders no one could hear in the noise. Rifles became hot and fouled from too much firing; the air was filled with a hail of bullets and shells.

Meade&#x27;s 1st Brigade of Pennsylvanians, under Brigadier General Truman Seymour, began advancing through the East Woods and exchanged fire with Colonel James Walker&#x27;s brigade of Alabama, Georgia, and North Carolina troops. As Walker&#x27;s men forced Seymour&#x27;s back, aided by Lee&#x27;s artillery fire, Ricketts&#x27;s division entered the Cornfield, also to be torn up by artillery. Brigadier General Abram Duryée&#x27;s brigade marched directly into volleys from Colonel Marcellus Douglass&#x27;s Georgia brigade. Enduring heavy fire from a range of and gaining no advantage because of a lack of reinforcements, Duryée ordered a withdrawal.

The reinforcements that Duryée had expected—brigades under Brigadier General George L. Hartsuff and Colonel William A. Christian—had difficulties reaching the scene. Hartsuff was wounded by a shell, and Christian dismounted and fled to the rear in terror. When the men were rallied and advanced into the Cornfield, they met the same artillery and infantry fire as their predecessors. As the superior Union numbers began to tell, the Louisiana &quot;Tiger&quot; Brigade under Harry Hays entered the fray and forced the Union men back to the East Woods. The casualties received by the 12th Massachusetts Infantry, 67%, were the highest of any unit that day. The Tigers were beaten back eventually when the Federals deployed an artillery battery in the Cornfield. Point-blank fire slaughtered the Tigers, who lost 323 of their 500 men.

While the Cornfield remained a bloody stalemate, Federal advances a few hundred yards to the west were more successful. Brigadier General John Gibbon&#x27;s 4th Brigade of Doubleday&#x27;s division (recently named the Iron Brigade) began advancing down and astride the turnpike, into the cornfield, and in the West Woods, pushing aside Jackson&#x27;s men. They were halted by a charge of 1,150 men from Starke&#x27;s brigade, leveling heavy fire from away. The Confederate brigade withdrew after being exposed to fierce return fire from the Iron Brigade, and Starke was mortally wounded. The Union advance on the Dunker Church resumed and cut a large gap in Jackson&#x27;s defensive line, which teetered near collapse. Although the cost was steep, Hooker&#x27;s corps was making steady progress.

Confederate reinforcements arrived just after 7a.m. The divisions under McLaws and Richard H. Anderson arrived following a night march from Harpers Ferry. Around 7:15, General Lee moved George T. Anderson&#x27;s Georgia brigade from the right flank of the army to aid Jackson. At 7a.m., Hood&#x27;s division of 2,300 men advanced through the West Woods and pushed the Union troops back through the Cornfield again. They were aided by three brigades of D.H. Hill&#x27;s division arriving from the Mumma Farm, southeast of the Cornfield, and by Jubal Early&#x27;s brigade, pushing through the West Woods from the Nicodemus Farm, where they had been supporting Jeb Stuart&#x27;s horse artillery. Some officers of the Iron Brigade rallied men around the artillery pieces of Battery B, 4th U.S. Artillery, and Gibbon himself saw to it that his previous unit did not lose a single caisson. Hood&#x27;s men bore the brunt of the fighting, however, and paid a heavy price—60% casualties—but they were able to prevent the defensive line from crumbling and held off the I Corps. When asked by a fellow officer where his division was, Hood replied, &quot;Dead on the field.&quot;

====Mansfield and Sedgwick====

Hooker&#x27;s men had also paid heavily but without achieving their objectives. After two hours and 2,500 casualties, they were back where they started. The Cornfield, an area about deep and wide, was a scene of indescribable destruction. It was estimated that the Cornfield changed hands no fewer than 15 times in the course of the morning. Maj. Rufus Dawes, who assumed command of Iron Brigade&#x27;s 6th Wisconsin Regiment during the battle, later compared the fighting around the Hagerstown Turnpike with the stone wall at Fredericksburg, Spotsylvania&#x27;s &quot;Bloody Angle&quot;, and the slaughter pen of Cold Harbor, insisting that &quot;the Antietam Turnpike surpassed them all in manifest evidence of slaughter.&quot; Hooker was reinforced by the 7,200 infantrymen of Mansfield&#x27;s XII Corps, which had been held in a loosely defined reserve role.

Half of Mansfield&#x27;s men were raw recruits, and Mansfield was also inexperienced, having taken command only two days before. Although he was a veteran of 40 years&#x27; service, he had never led large numbers of soldiers in combat. Concerned that his men would bolt under fire, he marched them in a formation that was known as &quot;column of companies, closed in mass,&quot; a bunched-up formation in which a regiment was arrayed ten ranks deep instead of the normal two. As his men entered the East Woods, they presented an excellent artillery target, &quot;almost as good a target as a barn.&quot; Mansfield himself was shot in the chest and died the next day. Alpheus Williams assumed temporary command of the XII Corps.

The new recruits of Mansfield&#x27;s 1st Division made no progress against Hood&#x27;s line, which was reinforced by brigades of D. H. Hill&#x27;s division under Colquitt and McRae. The 2nd Division of the XII Corps, under George Sears Greene, however, broke through McRae&#x27;s men, who fled under the mistaken belief that they were about to be trapped by a flanking attack. This breach of the line forced Hood and his men, outnumbered, to regroup in the West Woods, where they had started the day. Greene was able to reach the vicinity of Dunker Church, and drove off Stephen Lee&#x27;s batteries.
Hooker attempted to coordinate the assault, but a Confederate sharpshooter spotted the general and his white horse and shot Hooker through the foot. Command of his I Corps was assigned to Meade by Hooker. Ricketts had seniority over Meade, but McClellan backed Hooker&#x27;s decision to place Meade in command of the corps. But with Hooker removed from the field, there was no general left with the authority to coordinate the remaining troops on the field.

In an effort to turn the Confederate left flank and relieve the pressure on Mansfield&#x27;s men, Sumner&#x27;s II Corps was ordered at 7:20 a.m. to send two divisions into battle. Sedgwick&#x27;s division of 5,400 men was the first to ford the Antietam, and they entered the East Woods with the intention of turning left and forcing the Confederates south into the assault of Ambrose Burnside&#x27;s IX Corps. But the plan went awry. They became separated from William H. French&#x27;s division, and at 9a.m. Sumner, who was accompanying the division, launched the attack with an unusual battle formation—the three brigades in three long lines, men side-by-side, with only 50 to separating the lines. They were assaulted first by Confederate artillery and then from three sides by the divisions of Early, Walker, and McLaws, and in less than half an hour Sedgwick&#x27;s men were forced to retreat in great disorder to their starting point with over 2,200 casualties, including Sedgwick himself, who was taken out of action for several months by a wound. Sumner has been condemned by most historians for his &quot;reckless&quot; attack, his lack of coordination with the I and XII Corps headquarters, losing control of French&#x27;s division when he accompanied Sedgwick&#x27;s, failing to perform adequate reconnaissance prior to launching his attack, and selecting the unusual battle formation that was so effectively flanked by the Confederate counterattack. Historian M. V. Armstrong&#x27;s recent scholarship, however, has determined that Sumner did perform appropriate reconnaissance and his decision to attack where he did was justified by the information available to him.

At around 9:45a.m., Williams was tasked with reinforcing Sumner, and he sent two XII Corps regiments towards the Hagerstown Turnpike. The two regiments were confronted by the division of John G. Walker, newly arrived from the Confederate right. Walker&#x27;s men repulsed the two Union regiments, and one of the Confederate brigades, commanded by Colonel Van H. Manning attacked Greene&#x27;s position near the Dunker Church around 10a.m. After repulsing Manning&#x27;s brigade, Greene&#x27;s soldiers counterattacked into the West Woods. The fighting died down around the Dunker Church, and shifted towards Lee&#x27;s center. The morning phase ended with casualties on both sides of almost 13,000, including two Union corps commanders.

===Midday phase===
====Opening assaults on the Sunken Road====

By midday, the action had shifted to the center of the Confederate line. Sumner had accompanied the morning attack of Sedgwick&#x27;s division, but another of his divisions, under French, lost contact with Sumner and Sedgwick and inexplicably headed south. Eager for an opportunity to see combat, French found skirmishers in his path and ordered his men forward. By this time, Sumner&#x27;s aide (and son) located French, described the terrible fighting in the West Woods and relayed an order for him to divert Confederate attention by attacking their center.

French confronted D.H. Hill&#x27;s division. Hill commanded about 2,500 men, less than half the number under French, and three of his five brigades had been torn up during the morning combat. This sector of Longstreet&#x27;s line was theoretically the weakest. But Hill&#x27;s men were in a strong defensive position, atop a gradual ridge, in a sunken road worn down by years of wagon traffic, which formed a natural trench.

French launched a series of brigade-sized assaults against Hill&#x27;s improvised breastworks at around 9:30 a.m.. The first brigade to attack, mostly inexperienced troops commanded by Brigadier General Max Weber, was quickly cut down by heavy rifle fire; neither side deployed artillery at this point. The second attack, more raw recruits under Colonel Dwight Morris, was also subjected to heavy fire but managed to beat back a counterattack by the Alabama Brigade of Robert Rodes. The third, under Brigadier General Nathan Kimball, included three veteran regiments, but they also fell to fire from the sunken road. French&#x27;s division suffered 1,750 casualties (of his 5,700 men) in under an hour.

Reinforcements were arriving on both sides, and by 10:30 a.m. Robert E. Lee sent his final reserve division—some 3,400 men under Major General Richard H. Anderson—to bolster Hill&#x27;s line and extend it to the right, preparing an attack that would envelop French&#x27;s left flank. But at the same time, the 4,000 men of Major General Israel B. Richardson&#x27;s division arrived on French&#x27;s left. This was the last of Sumner&#x27;s three divisions, which had been held up in the rear by McClellan as he organized his reserve forces.
Leading off the fourth attack of the day against the sunken road was the Irish Brigade of Brigadier General Thomas F. Meagher. As they advanced with emerald green flags snapping in the breeze, a regimental chaplain, Father William Corby, rode back and forth across the front of the formation shouting words of conditional absolution prescribed by the Roman Catholic Church for those who were about to die. The mostly Irish immigrants lost 540 men to heavy volleys before they were ordered to withdraw.

General Richardson personally dispatched the brigade of Brigadier General John C. Caldwell into battle around noon (after being told that Caldwell was in the rear, behind a haystack), and finally the tide turned. Anderson&#x27;s Confederate division had been little help to the defenders after General Anderson was wounded early in the fighting. Other key leaders were lost as well, including George B. Anderson (no relation; Anderson&#x27;s successor, Colonel Charles C. Tew of the 2nd North Carolina, was killed minutes after assuming command) and Colonel John B. Gordon of the 6th Alabama. The Confederate command structure was becoming disorganized.

====Collapse of the Sunken Road====

As Caldwell&#x27;s brigade advanced around the right flank of the Confederates, Colonel Francis C. Barlow led the 61st and 64th New York forward. Barlow and Lieutenant Colonel Nelson Miles saw a weak point in the line and maneuvered their troops into a position that allowed them to pour enfilade fire into the Confederate line, turning it into a deadly trap. In attempting to wheel around to meet this threat, a command from Rodes was misunderstood by Lt. Colonel James N. Lightfoot, who had succeeded Gordon. Lightfoot ordered his men to about-face and march away, an order that all five regiments of the brigade thought applied to them as well. Confederate troops streamed toward Sharpsburg, their line lost. Most of George Anderson&#x27;s brigade withdrew as well, caught up in the retreat of Richard Anderson&#x27;s division.

Richardson&#x27;s men were in hot pursuit when massed artillery hastily assembled by General Longstreet drove them back. A counterattack with 200 men led by D.H. Hill got around the Federal left flank near the sunken road, and although they were driven back by a fierce charge of the 5th New Hampshire, this stemmed the collapse of the center. Reluctantly, Richardson ordered his division to fall back to north of the ridge facing the sunken road. His division lost about 1,000 men. Colonel Barlow was severely wounded, and Richardson mortally wounded. Winfield S. Hancock assumed division command. Although Hancock would have an excellent future reputation as an aggressive division and corps commander, the unexpected change of command sapped the momentum of the Federal advance.
The carnage from 9:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. on the sunken road gave it the name &quot;Bloody Lane&quot;, leaving about 5,600 casualties (Union 3,000, Confederate 2,600) along the road. And yet, a great opportunity presented itself. If this broken sector of the Confederate line were exploited, Lee&#x27;s army would be divided in half and possibly defeated. There were ample forces available to do so. There was a reserve of 3,500 cavalry and the 10,300 infantrymen of General Porter&#x27;s V Corps, waiting near the middle bridge, a mile away. The VI Corps, under Major General William B. Franklin, had just arrived with 12,000 men. The Rebels, under Manning, had made a second assault on the high ground to the left (held by Greene) overlooking the road that temporarily around noon, but Smith&#x27;s Division of VI Corps recaptured it. Franklin was ready to exploit this breakthrough, but Sumner, the senior corps commander, ordered him not to advance. Franklin appealed to McClellan, who left his headquarters in the rear to hear both arguments but backed Sumner&#x27;s decision, ordering Franklin and Hancock to hold their positions. McClellan never lost this ground for the remainder of the battle and eventually had amassed 44 guns on it.

Later in the day, the commander of the other reserve unit near the center, the V Corps, Major General Fitz John Porter, heard recommendations from Major General George Sykes, commanding his 2nd Division, that another attack be made in the center, an idea that intrigued McClellan. However, Porter is said to have told McClellan, &quot;Remember, General, I command the last reserve of the last Army of the Republic.&quot; McClellan demurred and another opportunity was lost.

===Afternoon phase===
====Burnside&#x27;s Bridge====

The action moved to the southern end of the battlefield. McClellan&#x27;s plan called for Major General Ambrose Burnside and the IX Corps to conduct a diversionary attack in support of Hooker&#x27;s I Corps, hoping to draw Confederate attention away from the intended main attack in the north. However, Burnside was instructed to wait for explicit orders before launching his attack, and those orders did not reach him until 10a.m. Burnside was largely passive during preparations for the battle. The IX Corps had a clumsy command structure - Burnside had earlier commanded one wing of the Union army, composed of the I and IX Corps. Despite the I Corps being detached from Burnside&#x27;s control, he still acted as if he were a wing commander. Orders for the IX Corps went to Burnside, who then passed them on directly to Jacob Cox. Cox had assumed temporary command of the corps after the death of Reno at South Mountain.

Burnside had four divisions (12,500 troops) and 50 guns east of Antietam Creek. Facing him was a force that had been greatly depleted by Lee&#x27;s movement of units to bolster the Confederate left flank. At dawn, the divisions of Brig. Gens. David R. Jones and John G. Walker stood in defense, but by 10a.m. all of Walker&#x27;s men and Colonel George T. Anderson&#x27;s Georgia brigade had been removed. Jones had only about 3,000 men and 12 guns available to meet Burnside. Four thin brigades guarded the ridges near Sharpsburg, primarily a low plateau known as Cemetery Hill. The remaining 400 men—the 2nd and 20th Georgia regiments, under the command of Brigadier General Robert Toombs, with two artillery batteries—defended Rohrbach&#x27;s Bridge, a three-span, 125-foot (38 m) stone structure that was the southernmost crossing of the Antietam. It would become known to history as Burnside&#x27;s Bridge because of the notoriety of the coming battle. The bridge was a difficult objective. The main road leading to it was exposed to enemy fire, but a farm lane allowed a more protected approach to around from the bridge. The bridge was dominated by a steep bluff on the west bank, and trees and an old quarry provided cover for defenders. The Confederates also strengthed their position with breastworks made from logs and fence rails.
Historians question why Burnside spent so much time at the bridge on Antietam Creek when the creek could have been forded &quot;at a variety of places out of enemy range&quot;. The commanding terrain across the sometimes shallow creek made crossing the water a comparatively easy part of a difficult problem. Burnside concentrated his plan instead on storming the bridge while simultaneously crossing a ford McClellan&#x27;s engineers had identified a half mile (1 km) downstream, but when Burnside&#x27;s men reached it, they found the banks too high to negotiate. While Colonel George Crook&#x27;s Ohio brigade prepared to attack the bridge with the support of Brigadier General Samuel Sturgis&#x27;s division, the rest of the Kanawha Division and Brigadier General Isaac Rodman&#x27;s division struggled through thick brush trying to locate Snavely&#x27;s Ford, 2 miles (3 km) downstream, intending to flank the Confederates.

Crook&#x27;s assault on the bridge was led by skirmishers from the 11th Connecticut, who were ordered to clear the bridge for the Ohioans to cross and assault the bluff. After receiving punishing fire for 15 minutes, the Connecticut men withdrew with 139 casualties, one-third of their strength, including their commander, Colonel Henry W. Kingsbury, who was fatally wounded. Crook&#x27;s main assault went awry when his unfamiliarity with the terrain caused his men to reach the creek a quarter mile (400 m) upstream from the bridge, where they exchanged volleys with Confederate skirmishers for the next few hours.
While Rodman&#x27;s division was out of touch, slogging toward Snavely&#x27;s Ford, Burnside and Cox directed a second assault at the bridge by one of Sturgis&#x27;s brigades, led by the 2nd Maryland and 6th New Hampshire. They also fell prey to the Confederate sharpshooters and artillery, and their attack fell apart. By this time it was noon, and McClellan was losing patience. He sent a succession of couriers to motivate Burnside to move forward. He ordered one aide, &quot;Tell him if it costs 10,000 men he must go now.&quot; He increased the pressure by sending his inspector general, Colonel Delos B. Sackett, to confront Burnside, who reacted indignantly: &quot;McClellan appears to think I am not trying my best to carry this bridge; you are the third or fourth one who has been to me this morning with similar orders.&quot;

The third attempt to take the bridge was at 12:30 p.m. by Sturgis&#x27;s other brigade, commanded by Brigadier General Edward Ferrero. It was led by the 51st New York and the 51st Pennsylvania, who, with adequate artillery support and a promise that a recently canceled whiskey ration would be restored if they were successful, charged downhill and took up positions on the east bank. Maneuvering a captured light howitzer into position, they fired double canister down the bridge and got within of the enemy. By 1p.m., Confederate ammunition was running low, and word reached Toombs that Rodman&#x27;s men were crossing Snavely&#x27;s Ford on their flank. He ordered a withdrawal. His Georgians had cost the Federals more than 500 casualties, giving up fewer than 160 themselves. And they had stalled Burnside&#x27;s assault on the southern flank for more than three hours.

====A. P. Hill arrives====
Burnside&#x27;s assault stalled again on its own. His officers had neglected to transport ammunition across the bridge, which was itself becoming a bottleneck for soldiers, artillery, and wagons. This represented another two-hour delay. General Lee used this time to bolster his right flank. He ordered up every available artillery unit, although he made no attempt to strengthen D.R. Jones&#x27;s badly outnumbered force with infantry units from the left. Instead, he counted on the arrival of A.P. Hill&#x27;s Light Division, currently embarked on an exhausting 17 mile (27 km) march from Harpers Ferry. By 2p.m., Hill&#x27;s men had reached Boteler&#x27;s Ford, and Hill was able to confer with the relieved Lee at 2:30, who ordered him to bring up his men to the right of Jones.

The Federals were completely unaware that 3,000 new men would be facing them. Burnside&#x27;s plan was to move around the weakened Confederate right flank, converge on Sharpsburg, and cut Lee&#x27;s army off from Boteler&#x27;s Ford, their only escape route across the Potomac. At 3p.m., Burnside left Sturgis&#x27;s division in reserve on the west bank and moved west with over 8,000 troops (most of them fresh) and 22 guns for close support.

An initial assault led by the 79th New York &quot;Cameron Highlanders&quot; succeeded against Jones&#x27;s outnumbered division, which was pushed back past Cemetery Hill and to within of Sharpsburg. Farther to the Union left, Rodman&#x27;s division advanced toward Harpers Ferry Road. Its lead brigade, under Colonel Harrison Fairchild, containing several colorful Zouaves of the 9th New York, commanded by Colonel Rush Hawkins, came under heavy shellfire from a dozen enemy guns mounted on a ridge to their front, but they kept pushing forward. There was panic in the streets of Sharpsburg, clogged with retreating Confederates. Of the five brigades in Jones&#x27;s division, only Toombs&#x27;s brigade was still intact, but he had only 700 men.

A. P. Hill&#x27;s division arrived at 3:30 p.m. Hill divided his column, with two brigades moving southeast to guard his flank and the other three, about 2,000 men, moving to the right of Toombs&#x27;s brigade and preparing for a counterattack. At 3:40 p.m., Brigadier General Maxcy Gregg&#x27;s brigade of South Carolinians attacked the 16th Connecticut on Rodman&#x27;s left flank in the cornfield of farmer John Otto. The Connecticut men had been in service for only three weeks, and their line disintegrated with 185 casualties. The 4th Rhode Island came up on the right, but they had poor visibility amid the high stalks of corn, and they were disoriented because many of the Confederates were wearing Union uniforms captured at Harpers Ferry. They also broke and ran, leaving the 8th Connecticut far out in advance and isolated. They were enveloped and driven down the hills toward Antietam Creek. A counterattack by regiments from the Kanawha Division fell short.

The IX Corps had suffered casualties of about 20% but still possessed twice the number of Confederates confronting them. Unnerved by the collapse of his flank, Burnside ordered his men all the way back to the west bank of the Antietam, where he urgently requested more men and guns. McClellan was able to provide just one battery. He said, &quot;I can do nothing more. I have no infantry.&quot; In fact, however, McClellan had two fresh corps in reserve, Porter&#x27;s V and Franklin&#x27;s VI, but he was too cautious, concerned he was greatly outnumbered and that a massive counterstrike by Lee was imminent. Burnside&#x27;s men spent the rest of the day guarding the bridge they had suffered so much to capture.
==Aftermath==
===Casualties===

The battle was over by 5:30 p.m. On the morning of September 18, Lee&#x27;s army prepared to defend against a Federal assault that never came. After an improvised truce for both sides to recover and exchange their wounded, Lee&#x27;s forces began withdrawing across the Potomac that evening to return to Virginia. Losses from the battle were heavy on both sides. The Union had 12,410 casualties with 2,108 dead. Confederate casualties were 10,316 with 1,547 dead. This represented 25% of the Federal force and 31% of the Confederates. Overall, both sides lost a combined total of 22,727 casualties in a single day, almost the same amount as the number of losses that had shocked the nation at the 2-day Battle of Shiloh five months earlier.

Several generals died as a result of the battle, including major generals Joseph K. Mansfield and Israel B. Richardson and Brigadier General Isaac P. Rodman on the Union side, and brigadier generals Lawrence O. Branch and William E. Starke on the Confederate side. Confederate Brigadier General George B. Anderson was shot in the ankle during the defense of the Bloody Lane. He survived the battle but died later in October after an amputation. Six generals on each side were wounded. All were brigadiers except Union Major General Hooker and Confederate Major General Richard H. Anderson.

Antietam saw the most casualties for a single-day battle during the war, and has been described as the bloodiest day in all of American history. The battle ranks in the top ten in terms of total casualties in American Civil War battles. One source has the battle ranked fifth, falling behind Gettysburg, Chickamauga, Chancellorsville, and Spotsylvania Court House. Another source ranks Antietam eighth with the additional battles of the Wilderness, Shiloh, and Stones River ranked higher. Among those assisting the undersupplied army surgeons during (and after) the battle was Clara Barton, who brought a wagonload of medical supplies to the battlefield. She later founded the American Red Cross disaster relief organization.

===Reactions and significance===

President Lincoln was disappointed in McClellan&#x27;s performance. He believed that McClellan&#x27;s overly cautious and poorly coordinated actions in the field had forced the battle to a draw rather than a crippling Confederate defeat. The president was even more astonished that from September 17 to October 26, despite repeated entreaties from the War Department and the president himself, McClellan declined to pursue Lee across the Potomac, citing shortages of equipment and the fear of overextending his forces. General-in-Chief Henry W. Halleck wrote in his official report, &quot;The long inactivity of so large an army in the face of a defeated foe, and during the most favorable season for rapid movements and a vigorous campaign, was a matter of great disappointment and regret.&quot; Lincoln relieved McClellan of his command of the Army of the Potomac on November 5, effectively ending the general&#x27;s military career. He was replaced on November 9 by General Burnside.

Casualties were comparable on both sides, although Lee lost a higher percentage of his army. Lee withdrew from the battlefield first, the technical definition of the tactical loser in a Civil War battle. However, in a strategic sense, despite being a tactical draw, Antietam is considered a turning point of the war and a victory for the Union because it ended Lee&#x27;s strategic campaign (his first invasion of Union territory). American historian James M. McPherson summed up the importance of the Battle of Antietam in his book, &quot;Crossroads of Freedom&quot;:

The results of Antietam also allowed President Lincoln to issue the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation on September 22, which gave Confederate states until January 1, 1863, to end their rebellion or else lose their slaves. Although Lincoln had intended to do so earlier, Secretary of State William H. Seward, at a cabinet meeting, advised him to wait until the Union won a significant victory so as to avoid the perception that it was issued out of desperation.

The Union victory and Lincoln&#x27;s proclamation played a considerable role in dissuading the governments of France and Britain from recognizing the Confederacy; some suspected they were planning to do so in the aftermath of another Union defeat. When emancipation was linked to the progress of the war, neither government had the political will to oppose the United States, since it linked support of the Confederacy to support for slavery. Both countries had already abolished slavery, and neither the French public nor the British would have tolerated their respective governments militarily supporting a foreign state actively fighting to preserve slavery.

Photographers Alexander Gardner and James F. Gibson arrived on the battlefield on September 17 or 18, and took a number of photographs on the battlefield, with most of the work being done between September 19 and September 22. Additional portraits were made in October during a visit by Lincoln to the Union army. The Union public showed great interest in the photographs, particularly those taken of corpses on the field. This was the first time that an American battlefield had been photographed before the casualties had been removed.

==Battlefield preservation==

The battle is commemorated at Antietam National Battlefield. Conservation work undertaken by Antietam National Battlefield and private groups, has earned Antietam a reputation as one of the nation&#x27;s best preserved Civil War battlefields. Few visual intrusions mar the landscape, letting visitors experience the site nearly as it was in 1862.

Antietam was one of the first five Civil War battlefields preserved federally, receiving that distinction on August 30, 1890. Over 300 tablets have been placed to mark the spots of individual regiments and of significant phases in the battle. The battlefield was transferred to the Department of the Interior in 1933. The Antietam National Battlefield now consists of approximately 3,000 acres.

The American Battlefield Trust and its partners have acquired and preserved 488 acres of the Antietam Battlefield as of January 2024. In 2015, the Trust saved 44.4 acres in the heart of the battlefield, between the Cornfield and the Dunker Church, when it purchased the Wilson farm for about $1 million. The preservation organization has since removed the postwar house and barn that stood on the property along Hagerstown Pike and returned the land to its wartime appearance.

<doc id="84864" wikidata="Q309765" url="?curid=84864" title="Edward Thorndike">
<text>Edward Lee Thorndike ( – ) was an American psychologist who spent nearly his entire career at Teachers College, Columbia University. His work on comparative psychology and the learning process led to his &quot;theory of connectionism&quot; and helped lay the scientific foundation for educational psychology. He also worked on solving industrial problems, such as employee exams and testing. 

Thorndike was a member of the board of the Psychological Corporation and served as president of the American Psychological Association in 1912. A &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot; survey, published in 2002, ranked Thorndike as the ninth-most cited psychologist of the 20th century. Edward Thorndike had a powerful impact on reinforcement theory and behavior analysis, providing the basic framework for empirical laws in behavior psychology with his law of effect. Through his contributions to the behavioral psychology field came his major impacts on education, where the law of effect has great influence in the classroom.

==Early life and education==
Thorndike, born in Williamsburg, Massachusetts was the son of Edward R and Abbie B Thorndike, a Methodist minister in Lowell, Massachusetts. Thorndike graduated from The Roxbury Latin School (1891), in West Roxbury, Massachusetts and from Wesleyan University (B.S. 1895). He earned an M.A. at Harvard University in 1897. His two brothers (Lynn and Ashley) also became important scholars. The younger, Lynn, was a medievalist specializing in the history of science and magic, while the older, Ashley, was an English professor and noted authority on Shakespeare.

While at Harvard, he was interested in how animals learn (ethology), and worked with William James. Afterwards, he became interested in the animal &#x27;man&#x27;, to the study of which he then devoted his life. Edward&#x27;s thesis is sometimes thought of as the essential document of modern comparative psychology. Upon graduation, Thorndike returned to his initial interest, educational psychology. In 1898 he completed his PhD at Columbia University under the supervision of James McKeen Cattell, one of the founding fathers of psychometrics.

In 1899, after a year of unhappy initial employment at the College for Women of Case Western Reserve in Cleveland, Ohio, he became an instructor in psychology at Teachers College at Columbia University, where he remained for the rest of his career, studying human learning, education, and mental testing. In 1937 Thorndike became the second President of the Psychometric Society, following in the footsteps of Louis Leon Thurstone who had established the society and its journal Psychometrika the previous year.

On August 29, 1900, he wed Elizabeth Moulton. They had four children, among them Frances, who became a mathematician.

During the early stages of his career, he purchased a wide tract of land on the Hudson and encouraged other researchers to settle around him. Soon a colony had formed there with him as its &#x27;tribal&#x27; chief.

==Connectionism==

Thorndike was a pioneer not only in behaviorism and in studying learning, but also in using animals in clinical experiments. Thorndike was able to create a theory of learning based on his research with animals. His doctoral dissertation, &quot;Animal Intelligence: An Experimental Study of the Associative Processes in Animals&quot;, was the first in psychology where the subjects were nonhumans. Thorndike was interested in whether animals could learn tasks through imitation or observation. To test this, Thorndike created puzzle boxes.
The puzzle boxes were approximately 20 inches long, 15 inches wide, and 12 inches tall. Each box had a door that was pulled open by a weight attached to a string that ran over a pulley and was attached to the door. The string attached to the door led to a lever or button inside the box. When the animal pressed the bar or pulled the lever, the string attached to the door would cause the weight to lift and the door to open. Thorndike&#x27;s puzzle boxes were arranged so that the animal would be required to perform a certain response (pulling a lever or pushing a button), while he measured the amount of time it took them to escape. Once the animal had performed the desired response they were allowed to escape and were also given a reward, usually food. Thorndike primarily used cats in his puzzle boxes. When the cats were put into the cages they would wander restlessly and meow, but they did not know how to escape. Eventually, the cats would step on the switch on the floor by chance, and the door would open. To see if the cats could learn through observation, he had them observe other animals escaping from the box. He would then compare the times of those who got to observe others escaping with those who did not, and he found that there was no difference in their rate of learning. Thorndike saw the same results with other animals, and he observed that there was no improvement even when he placed the animals&#x27; paws on the correct levers, buttons, or bar. These failures led him to fall back on a trial and error explanation of learning. He found that after accidentally stepping on the switch once, they would press the switch faster in each succeeding trial inside the puzzle box. By observing and recording the animals&#x27; escapes and escape times, Thorndike was able to graph the times it took for the animals in each trial to escape, resulting in a learning curve. The animals had difficulty escaping at first, but eventually &quot;caught on&quot; and escaped faster and faster with each successive puzzle box trial, until they eventually leveled off. The quickened rate of escape results in the s-shape of the learning curve. The learning curve also suggested that different species learned in the same way but at different speeds. From his research with puzzle boxes, Thorndike was able to create his own theory of learning.
The puzzle box experiments were motivated in part by Thorndike&#x27;s dislike for statements that animals made use of extraordinary faculties such as insight in their problem solving: &quot;In the first place, most of the books do not give us a psychology, but rather a eulogy of animals. They have all been about animal intelligence, never about animal stupidity.&quot;

Thorndike meant to distinguish clearly whether or not cats escaping from puzzle boxes were using insight. Thorndike&#x27;s instruments in answering this question were learning curves revealed by plotting the time it took for an animal to escape the box each time it was in the box. He reasoned that if the animals were showing insight, then their time to escape would suddenly drop to a negligible period, which would also be shown in the learning curve as an abrupt drop; while animals using a more ordinary method of trial and error would show gradual curves. His finding was that cats consistently showed gradual learning.

==Adult learning==
Thorndike put his testing expertise to work for the United States Army during World War I, participating in the development of the Army Beta test used to evaluate illiterate, unschooled, and non-English speaking recruits.

Thorndike believed that &quot;Instruction should pursue specified, socially useful goals.&quot; Thorndike believed that the ability to learn did not decline until age 35, and only then at a rate of 1 percent per year. Thorndike also stated the law of effect, which says behaviors that are followed by good consequences are likely to be repeated in the future.

Thorndike identified the three main areas of intellectual development. The first being abstract intelligence. This is the ability to process and understand different concepts. The second is mechanical intelligence, which is the ability to handle physical objects. Lastly there is social intelligence. This is the ability to handle human interaction.

#Learning is incremental.
#Learning occurs automatically.
#All animals learn the same way.
#Law of effect– if an association is followed by a &quot;satisfying state of affairs&quot; it will be strengthened and if it is followed by an &quot;annoying state of affairs &quot; it will be weakened.
#Thorndike&#x27;s law of exercise has two parts; the law of use and the law of disuse.
##Law of use– the more often an association is used the stronger it becomes.
##Law of disuse– the longer an association is unused the weaker it becomes.
#Law of recency– the most recent response is most likely to reoccur.
#Multiple response– problem solving through trial and error. An animal will try multiple responses if the first response does not lead to a specific state of affairs.
#Set or attitude– animals are predisposed to act in a specific way.
#Prepotency of elements– a subject can filter out irrelevant aspects of a problem and focus and respond only to significant elements of a problem.
#Response by analogy– responses from a related or similar context may be used in a new context.
#Identical elements theory of transfer– This theory states that the extent to which information learned in one situation will transfer to another situation is determined by the similarity between the two situations. The more similar the situations are, the greater the amount of information that will transfer. Similarly, if the situations have nothing in common, information learned in one situation will not be of any value in the other situation.
#Associative shifting– it is possible to shift any response from occurring with one stimulus to occurring with another stimulus. Associative shift maintains that a response is first made to situation A, then to AB, and then finally to B, thus shifting a response from one condition to another by associating it with that condition.
#Law of readiness– a quality in responses and connections that results in readiness to act. Thorndike acknowledges that responses may differ in their readiness. He claims that eating has a higher degree of readiness than vomiting, that weariness detracts from the readiness to play and increases the readiness to sleep. Also, Thorndike argues that a low or negative status in respect to readiness is called unreadiness. Behavior and learning are influenced by the readiness or unreadiness of responses, as well as by their strength.
#Identifiability– According to Thorndike, the identification or placement of a situation is a first response of the nervous system, which can recognize it. Then connections may be made to one another or to another response, and these connections depend upon the original identification. Therefore, a large amount of learning is made up of changes in the identifiability of situations. Thorndike also believed that analysis might turn situations into compounds of features, such as the number of sides on a shape, to help the mind grasp and retain the situation, and increase their identifiability.
#Availability– The ease of getting a specific response. For example, it would be easier for a person to learn to touch their nose or mouth than it would be for them to draw a line 5 inches long with their eyes closed.

===Development of law of effect===

Thorndike&#x27;s research focused on instrumental learning, which means that learning is developed from the organism doing something. For example, he placed a cat inside a wooden box. The cat would use various methods while trying to get out, but nothing would work until it hit the lever. Afterwards, Thorndike tried placing the cat inside the wooden box again. This time, the cat was able to hit the lever quickly and succeeded in getting out from the box.

At first, Thorndike emphasized the importance of dissatisfaction stemming from failure as equal to the reward of satisfaction with success, though in his experiments and trials on humans he came to conclude that reward is a much more effective motivator than punishment. He also emphasized that the satisfaction must come immediately after the success, or the lesson would not sink in.

==Eugenics==

Thorndike was a proponent of eugenics. He argued that &quot;selective breeding can alter man&#x27;s capacity to learn, to keep sane, to cherish justice or to be happy. There is no more certain and economical a way to improve man&#x27;s environment as to improve his nature.&quot; He stated:I hope to have made it clear that we have much to learn about eugenics, and also that we already know enough to justify us in providing for the original intellect and character of man in the future with a higher, purer source than the muddy streams of the past. If it is our duty to improve the face of the world and human customs and traditions, so that men unborn may live in better conditions, it is doubly our duty to improve the original natures of these men themselves. For there is no surer means of improving the conditions of life.
And furthermore:It is no part of my office to moralize on these facts. But surely it would be a pitiable thing if man should forever make inferior men as a by-product of passion, and deny good men life in mistaken devotion to palliative and remedial philanthropy. Ethics and religion must teach man to want the welfare of the future as well as the relief of the cripple before his eyes; and science must teach man to control his own future nature as well as the animals, plants, and physical forces amongst which he will have to live. It is a noble thing that human reason, bred of a myriad unreasoned happenings, and driven forth into life by whips made aeons ago with no thought of man&#x27;s higher wants, can yet turn back to understand man&#x27;s birth, survey his journey, chart and steer his future course, and free him from barriers without and defects within. Until the last removable impediment in man&#x27;s own nature dies childless, human reason will not rest.

==Thorndike on education==
Thorndike&#x27;s Educational psychology began a trend toward behavioral psychology that sought to use empirical evidence and a scientific approach to problem solving. Thorndike was among some of the first psychologists to combine learning theory, psychometrics, and applied research for school-related subjects to form psychology of education. One of his influences on education is seen by his ideas on mass marketing of tests and textbooks at that time. Thorndike opposed the idea that learning should reflect nature, which was the main thought of developmental scientists at that time. He instead thought that schooling should improve upon nature. Unlike many other psychologist of his time, Thorndike took a statistical approach to education in his later years by collecting qualitative information intended to help teachers and educators deal with practical educational problems. Thorndike&#x27;s theory was an association theory, as many were in that time. He believed that the association between stimulus and response was solidified by a reward or confirmation. He also thought that motivation was an important factor in learning. The Law of Effect introduced the relation between reinforcers and punishers. Although Thorndike&#x27;s description of the relation between reinforcers and punishers was incomplete, his work in this area would later become a catalyst in further research, such as that of B.F. Skinner.

Thorndike&#x27;s Law of Effect states that &quot;responses that produce a desired effect are more likely to occur again whereas responses that produce an unpleasant effect are less likely to occur again&quot;. The terms &#x27;desired effect&#x27; and &#x27;unpleasant effect&#x27; eventually became known as &#x27;reinforcers&#x27; and &#x27;punishers&#x27;. Thorndike&#x27;s contributions to the Behavioral Psychology Society are seen through his influences in the classroom, with a particular focus on praising and ignoring behaviors. Praise is used in the classroom to encourage and support the occurrence of a desired behavior. When used in the classroom, praise has been shown to increase correct responses and appropriate behavior. Planned ignoring is used to decrease, weaken, or eliminate the occurrence of a target behavior. Planned ignoring is accomplished by removing the reinforcer that is maintaining the behavior. For example, when the teacher does not pay attention to a &quot;whining&quot; behavior of a student, it allows the student to realize that whining will not succeed in gaining the attention of the teacher.

==Beliefs about the behavior of women==
Unlike later behaviorists such as John B. Watson, who placed a very strong emphasis on the impact of environmental influences on behavior, Thorndike believed that differences in the parental behavior of men and women were due to biological, rather than cultural, reasons. While conceding that society could &quot;complicate or deform&quot; what he believed were inborn differences, he believed that &quot;if we [researchers] should keep the environment of boys and girls absolutely similar these instincts would produce sure and important differences between the mental and moral activities of boys and girls&quot;. Indeed, Watson himself overtly critiqued the idea of maternal instincts in humans in a report of his observations of first-time mothers struggling to breastfeed. Watson argued that the very behaviors Thorndike referred to as resulting from a &quot;nursing instinct&quot; stemming from &quot;unreasoning tendencies to pet, coddle, and &#x27;do for&#x27; others,&quot; were performed with difficulty by new mothers and thus must have been learned, while &quot;instinctive factors are practically nil&quot;.

Thorndike&#x27;s beliefs about inborn differences between the thoughts and behavior of men and women included arguments about the role of women in society. For example, along with the &quot;nursing instinct,&quot; Thorndike talked about the instinct of &quot;submission to mastery,&quot; arguing that because men are typically physically larger than women, &quot;Women in general are thus by original nature submissive to men in general.&quot; Such beliefs were commonplace during this era.

==Thorndike&#x27;s word books==
Thorndike composed three different word books to assist teachers with word and reading instruction. After publication of &quot;The Teacher&#x27;s Word Book&quot; in 1921, two other books were written and published, each approximately a decade apart from its predecessor. The second book in the series, its full title being &quot;A Teacher&#x27;s Word Book of the Twenty Thousand Words Found Most Frequently and Widely in General Reading for Children and Young People&quot;, was published in 1932, and the third and final book, &quot;The Teacher&#x27;s Word Book of 30,000 Words&quot;, was published in 1944.

In Appendix A to the second book, Thorndike gives credit to his word counts and how frequencies were assigned to particular words. Selected sources extrapolated from Appendix A include:
*Children&#x27;s Reading: Black Beauty, Little Women, Treasure Island, A Christmas Carol, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, Youth&#x27;s Companion, school primers, first readers, second readers, and third readers
*Standard Literature: The Bible, Shakespeare, Tennyson, Wordsworth, Cowper, Pope, and Milton
*Common Facts and Trades: The United States Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, A New Book of Cookery, Practical Sewing and Dress Making, Garden and Farm Almanac, and mail-order catalogues

In the preface to the third book, Thorndike writes that the list contained therein &quot;tells anyone who wishes to know whether to use a word in writing, speaking, or teaching how common the word is in standard English reading matter&quot; (p. x), and he further advises that the list can best be employed by teachers if they allow it to guide the decisions they make choosing which words to emphasize during reading instruction. Some words require more emphasis than others, and, according to Thorndike, his list informs teachers of the most frequently occurring words that should be reinforced by instruction and thus become &quot;a permanent part of [students&#x27;] stock of word knowledge&quot; (p. xi). If a word is not on the list but appears in an educational text, its meaning only needs to be understood temporarily in the context in which it was found, and then summarily discarded from memory.

==Thorndike&#x27;s influence==
Thorndike contributed a great deal to psychology. His influence on animal psychologists, especially those who focused on behavior plasticity, greatly contributed to the future of that field. In addition to helping pave the way towards behaviorism, his contribution to measurement influenced philosophy, the administration and practice of education, military administration, industrial personnel administration, civil service and many public and private social services. Thorndike influenced many schools of psychology as Gestalt psychologists, psychologists studying the conditioned reflex, and behavioral psychologists all studied Thorndike&#x27;s research as a starting point. Thorndike was a contemporary of John B. Watson and Ivan Pavlov. However, unlike Watson, Thorndike introduced the concept of reinforcement. Thorndike was the first to apply psychological principles to the area of learning. His research led to many theories and laws of learning. His theory of learning, especially the law of effect, is most often considered to be his greatest achievement. In 1929, Thorndike addressed his early theory of learning, and claimed that he had been wrong. After further research, he was forced to denounce his law of exercise completely, because he found that practice alone did not strengthen an association, and that time alone did not weaken an association. He also got rid of half of the law of effect, after finding that a satisfying state of affairs strengthens an association, but punishment is not effective in modifying behavior. He placed a great emphasis on consequences of behavior as setting the foundation for what is and is not learned. His work represents the transition from the school of functionalism to behaviorism, and enabled psychology to focus on learning theory. Thorndike&#x27;s work would eventually be a major influence to B.F. Skinner and Clark Hull. Skinner, like Thorndike, put animals in boxes and observed them to see what they were able to learn.
The learning theories of Thorndike and Pavlov were later synthesized by Clark Hull. His work on motivation and attitude formation directly affected studies on human nature as well as social order. Thorndike&#x27;s research drove comparative psychology for fifty years, and influenced countless psychologists over that period of time, and even still today.

==Accomplishments==
In 1912, Thorndike was elected president for the American Psychological Association. In 1917 he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association. He was admitted to the National Academy of Sciences in 1917. He was one of the first psychologists to be admitted to the association. Thorndike is well known for his experiments on animals supporting the law of effect. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1932 and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1934. That same year, Thorndike was elected president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

==Criticism==
Thorndike&#x27;s connectionism has been criticized for being too simplistic and reductionistic. His law of effect and puzzle box methodology were subjected to detailed criticism by behaviorists and many other psychologists. The criticisms over the law of effect mostly cover four aspects of the theory: the implied or retroactive working of the effect, the philosophical implication of the law, the identification of the effective conditions that cause learning, and the comprehensive usefulness of the law.

Because of his &quot;racist, sexist, and antisemitic ideals&quot;, amid the George Floyd protests of 2020, the Board of Trustees of Teachers&#x27; College in New York voted unanimously to remove his name from Thorndike Hall.

<doc id="84871" wikidata="Q1058110" url="?curid=84871" title="Vejovis">
<text>Vejovis or Vejove ( or ; rare or ) was a Roman god of Etruscan origins (, or ).

==Representation and worship==
Vejovis was portrayed as a young man, holding a bunch of arrows (or lightning bolts), or a pilum, in his hand, and accompanied by a goat. Romans believed that Vejovis was one of the first gods to be born. He was a god of healing, and became associated with the Greek Asclepius. He was mostly worshipped in Rome and Bovillae in Latium. On the Capitoline Hill and on the Tiber Island, temples were erected in his honour.

Though he was associated with volcanic eruptions, his original role and function is obscured to us. He is occasionally identified with Apollo and young Jupiter.

Aulus Gellius, in the &quot;Noctes Atticae&quot;, written around 177 CE, speculated that Vejovis was an ill-omened counterpart of Jupiter; compare Summanus. Aulus Gellius observes that the particle &quot;ve-&quot; that prefixes the name of the god also appears in Latin words such as &quot;vesanus&quot;, &quot;insane,&quot; and thus interprets the name Vejovis as the anti-Jove.

===Temple===
He had a temple between the two peaks of the Capitoline Hill in Rome, where his statue carried a bundle of arrows and stood next to a statue of a she-goat.

===Sacrifices===
In spring, multiple goats were sacrificed to him to avert plagues. Gellius informs us that Vejovis received the sacrifice of a female goat, sacrificed &quot;ritu humano&quot;; this obscure phrase could either mean &quot;after the manner of a human sacrifice&quot; or &quot;in the manner of a burial.&quot; These offerings were less about the animal sacrificed and more about the soul sacrificed.

==Festivals==
Vejovis had three festivals in the Roman Calendar: on 1 January, 7 March, and 21 May.

<text>Morta (died in 1263) was Queen of Lithuania (1253–1262) upon the accession of her husband, King Mindaugas. Very little is known about her life. Probably, Morta was Mindaugas&#x27; second wife as Vaišvilkas, the eldest son of Mindaugas, was already a mature man active in international politics when Morta&#x27;s sons were still young and dependent on the parents. After her death, Mindaugas married her sister, the wife of Daumantas. In revenge, Daumantas allied with Treniota and assassinated Mindaugas and two of Morta&#x27;s sons in 1263.

==Origin==
Her pagan name is unknown. The only clue into her origin or birthplace is a short mention in the comments following the treaty signed in 1219 between the Lithuanian dukes and Galicia–Volhynia. It says that Mindaugas killed many members of the Bulaičiai family, including Vismantas, whose wife Mindaugas took for himself. The Hypatian Codex elaborates that Vismantas was killed in 1251–1253 during an attack against Vykintas&#x27; castle (often assumed to be in Tverai). It is generally assumed that Morta was Vismantas&#x27; wife. Lithuanian historian Edvardas Gudavičius analyzed toponyms and determined that the Bulaičiai family most likely hailed from the Šiauliai region. Based on this extrapolation, residents of Šiauliai call the city home of Morta. 

In the 16th-century &quot;Preussische Chronik&quot;, it is mentioned that Morta was actually from Sweden since at the time it was a common practice for pagan rulers who were seeking the throne to marry Christian brides from foreign countries. However, historians consider this claim to be untrue, suggesting that German chroniclers only thought so because they could not believe that a Lithuanian pagan could be such a fierce defender of Western Christianity.

==Life==
Morta&#x27;s life is briefly described in the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle. The Chronicle paints an image of a capable woman who advised her husband in political affairs and even provides several colorful dialogues between her and Mindaugas. According to the Chronicle, she supported Lithuanian conversion to Christianity, opposed Treniota, and defended the Christians when Mindaugas relapsed to his pagan faith. Taking into account her support to the Christians and the fact that her pagan name is unknown, Rimvydas Petrauskas proposed that perhaps Morta was baptized earlier than Mindaugas (he was baptized by the Bishop of Chełmno). 

==Family==
The written sources contain little information on Morta&#x27;s family and it is not entirely clear how many children she had. Two sons, Replys and Gerstukas, are mentioned once in an act dated August 7, 1261. The act, by which Mindaugas granted all of Selonia to the Livonian Order, could be a medieval forgery by the Order. According to the Hypatian Codex, two sons, Rūklys and Rupeikis, were assassinated together with Mindaugas in 1263. This is the only information available and historians disagree on whether these were the same two sons, whose names were distorted by medieval scribes, or whether there were four sons.

<text>Friedrich Robert Donat ( ; 18 March 1905 – 9 June 1958) was an English actor. Making his breakthrough film role in Alexander Korda&#x27;s &quot;The Private Life of Henry VIII&quot; (1933), today he is best remembered for his roles in &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; (1934), Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; (1935), and &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; (1939), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor as the gentle English schoolmaster Mr. Chips.

Beginning his career in theatre, Donat made his stage debut in 1921 playing Lucius in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, and in 1928 he appeared in productions at the Liverpool Playhouse, starring in plays by John Galsworthy, George Bernard Shaw among others, before moving to London in 1930. He appeared in the West End when he starred in &quot;A Sleeping Clergyman&quot; in 1933, and in 1936 he took on the management of the West End&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Theatre.

In his book, &quot;The Age of the Dream Palace&quot;, Jeffrey Richards wrote that Donat was &quot;British cinema&#x27;s one undisputed romantic leading man in the 1930s&quot;. &quot;The image he projected was that of the romantic idealist, often with a dash of the gentleman adventurer.&quot;

Donat suffered from chronic asthma, which affected his career and limited him to appearing in only 19 films.

==Early life==
Friedrich Robert Donat was born and baptised in Withington, Manchester, the fourth and youngest son of Ernst Emil Donat, a civil engineer of German origin from Prussia, and his wife, Rose Alice Green. He was of English, Polish, German and French descent and was educated at Manchester Central Grammar School for Boys. His older brother was Philip Donat, father of actors Richard and Peter Donat.

To cope with a bad stammer, he took elocution lessons with James Bernard, a leading teacher of &quot;dramatic interpretation&quot;. He left school at 15, working as Bernard&#x27;s secretary to fund his continued lessons.

==Stage career==
Donat made his first stage appearance in 1921, at the age of 16, with Henry Baynton&#x27;s company at the Prince of Wales Theatre, Birmingham, playing Lucius in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;. His break came in 1924 when he joined the company of Shakespearean actor Sir Frank Benson, where he stayed for four years. 

In 1928, he began a year at the Liverpool Playhouse, starring in plays by John Galsworthy, George Bernard Shaw and Harold Brighouse, among others. In 1929, he played at the Festival Theatre in Cambridge under the direction of Tyrone Guthrie. He appeared in a number of plays, some with Flora Robson, and also directed.

In 1929, Donat married Ella Annesley Voysey (1903 West Bromwich, Staffordshire – 1994), the daughter of Rev. Ellison Annesley Voysey and Rachel Voysey née Enthoven. Ellison was the youngest son of the theist Rev. Charles Voysey. The couple had two sons and a daughter, but divorced in 1946.

In 1930, Donat and his wife moved to London, where he eventually made his debut in &quot;Knave and Quean&quot; at the Ambassadors Theatre. He received acclaim for a performance in a revival of &quot;Saint Joan&quot;.

In 1931, he achieved notice as Gideon Sarn in a dramatisation of the Mary Webb novel, &quot;Precious Bane&quot;, and he played various roles at the 1931 Malvern Festival. In the early 1930s, he was known in the industry as &quot;screen test Donat&quot; because of his many unsuccessful auditions for various film producers. MGM producer Irving Thalberg spotted him on the London stage in &quot;Precious Bane&quot;, and offered him a part in the 1932 film &quot;Smilin&#x27; Through&quot;, which he declined.

==Film appearances==
Donat made his film debut in a quota quickie &quot;Men of Tomorrow&quot; (1932) for Alexander Korda&#x27;s London Films. An abysmal screen test for Korda had ended with Donat&#x27;s laughter. Reputedly, Korda reacted by exclaiming: &quot;That&#x27;s the most natural laugh I have ever heard in my life. What acting! Put him under contract immediately.&quot;

Korda cast Donat in the lead in &quot;That Night in London&quot; (1932), directed by Rowland V. Lee. He had a key role in &quot;Cash&quot; (1933), directed by Zoltan Korda, co-starring Edmund Gwenn. Donat&#x27;s first great screen success came in his fourth film, playing Thomas Culpeper in &quot;The Private Life of Henry VIII&quot; (1933), also produced by Korda. The film, starring Charles Laughton in the title role, was an enormous success around the world.

At the 1933 Malvern Festival, Donat received good reviews for his performance in &quot;A Sleeping Clergyman&quot;, which transferred to the West End. He was also in &quot;Saint Joan&quot;. In 1934, he appeared in the West End stage production of &quot;Mary Read&quot;, opposite Flora Robson. In 1936, Donat took on the management of the West End&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue, where he produced &quot;Red Night&quot; by J. L. Hodson.

Korda loaned Donat to Edward Small for the only film Donat made in Hollywood, &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; (1934). In exchange, Leslie Howard was sent to Korda to make &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;. &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; was successful and Donat was offered the lead role in a number of films for Warners, including &quot;Anthony Adverse&quot; (1935) and another swashbuckler, &quot;Captain Blood&quot; (1935). However, he did not like America and returned to Britain.

In England, Donat had the star role in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; (1935) opposite Madeleine Carroll. His performance was well-received: &quot;Mr. Donat, who has never been very well served in the cinema until now, suddenly blossoms out into a romantic comedian of no mean order&quot;, wrote the film critic C. A. Lejeune in &quot;The Observer&quot; at the time of the film&#x27;s release. Lejeune observed that he possessed &quot;an easy confident humour that has always been regarded as the perquisite of the American male star. For the first time on our screen we have the British equivalent of a Clark Gable or a Ronald Colman, playing in a purely national idiom. Mr. Donat, himself, I fancy, is hardly conscious of it, which is all to the good.&quot;

Hitchcock wanted Donat for the role of Edgar Brodie in &quot;Secret Agent&quot; (1936) and Detective Ted Spencer in &quot;Sabotage&quot; (1936), but this time Korda refused to release him. John Gielgud replaced him in &quot;Secret Agent&quot;, while John Loder took the role in &quot;Sabotage&quot;. MGM wanted him for &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; but he turned them down. Sam Goldwyn made several offers which were also turned down, as was an offer from David O. Selznick to appear in &quot;The Garden of Allah&quot;, and from Small to make &quot;The Son of Monte Cristo&quot;. Donat&#x27;s next film was for Korda, &quot;The Ghost Goes West&quot; (1935), a comedy directed by René Clair. 

Korda wanted Donat to make &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Instead, the actor appeared in Korda&#x27;s &quot;Knight Without Armour&quot; (1937). Korda became committed to the latter project because of Donat&#x27;s indecision. Madeleine Carroll had read the James Hilton novel while shooting &quot;The 39 Steps&quot;, and had persuaded Donat that it could be a good second film for them to star in together. Donat acquired the rights and passed them on to Korda, although Carroll was unavailable by then. His eventual co-star, Marlene Dietrich, was the source of much attention when she arrived in Britain. Donat was caught up in the furore, and the stress was so great that he suffered a nervous collapse a few days into the shooting and had to enter a nursing home. The production delay caused by Donat&#x27;s asthma led to talk of replacing him. Dietrich, whose contract with Korda was for $450,000, threatened to leave the project if that happened, and production was halted for two months, until Donat was able to return to work. He planned to return to the U.S. in 1937 to make &quot;Clementine&quot; for Small at RKO but changed his mind, fearing legal reprisals from Warners.

In 1938, Donat signed a contract with MGM British for £150,000 with a six-film commitment. In &quot;The Citadel&quot; (1938), he played Andrew Manson, a newly qualified Scottish doctor, a role for which he received his first Best Actor Oscar nomination. He played in George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Disciple&quot; (1938) on stage at the Piccadilly Theatre in London and the Old Vic.

Donat is best remembered for his role as the gentle English schoolmaster Mr. Chips in &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; (1939). He remarked: &quot;As soon as I put the moustache on, I felt the part, even if I did look like a great airedale come out of a puddle.&quot; Australian film critic Brian McFarlane writes: &quot;Class-ridden and sentimental perhaps, it remains extraordinarily touching in his Oscar-winning performance, and it ushers in the Donat of the postwar years.&quot; His rivals for the Best Actor Oscar were Clark Gable for &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, Laurence Olivier for &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, James Stewart for &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; and Mickey Rooney for &quot;Babes in Arms&quot;.

==The Second World War==
MGM wanted Donat to star in a movie about Beau Brummell and a new version of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; but that was delayed by the war. During the early days of the Second World War Donat focused on the stage. He played three roles at the 1939 Buxton Festival, including a part in &quot;The Good-Natur’d Man&quot;. 

He had the title role in the film &quot;The Young Mr. Pitt&quot; (1942) for 20th Century Fox and played Captain Shotover in a new staging of &quot;Heartbreak House&quot; at the Cambridge Theatre in London from 1942 to 1943. For MGM British he starred in the film &quot;The Adventures of Tartu&quot; (1943), with Valerie Hobson. Donat wanted to play the Chorus in Olivier&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot;, but the role went to Leslie Banks.

In 1943, he took over the lease of the Westminster Theatre, staging a number of plays there until 1945, including &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; (1943–44), &quot;The Glass Slipper&quot; (1944) and &quot;The Cure for Love&quot; (1945) by Walter Greenwood. With the latter, which he directed, he began his professional association with Renée Asherson, later his second wife.

Donat was reunited with Korda for the film &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; (1945), known in the United States as &quot;Vacation from Marriage&quot;, with Deborah Kerr. It was his last film for MGM British.

==Later career==
In 1946, Donat and Asherson appeared at the Aldwych Theatre in a production of &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, directed by Donat. He also directed &quot;The Man Behind the Statue&quot; by Peter Ustinov. Both lost money. In early 1947, immediately following his release from MGM-British, Eagle-Lion Films planned to shoot Gerald Butler&#x27;s &quot;Kiss the Blood Off My Hands&quot; with Donat in the lead and purchased the screen rights to the novel. The film was not made and the screen rights were scooped up by Burt Lancaster who starred in a 1948 film version. 

Donat had a small but crucial scene as Irish leader Charles Stewart Parnell in &quot;Captain Boycott&quot; (1947) with Stewart Granger. He appeared on stage in a revival of &quot;A Sleeping Clergyman&quot; in 1947.

He auditioned as Bill Sikes in David Lean&#x27;s &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1948), but Lean thought him wrong for the part and cast Robert Newton instead. Donat played the male lead in &quot;The Winslow Boy&quot; (1948), a popular adaptation of the Terence Rattigan play.

Donat and Asherson reprised their stage roles in the film version of &quot;The Cure for Love&quot; (1949). His only film as director, its production was affected by his ill health. The film&#x27;s soundtrack had to be re-recorded after shooting was completed because Donat&#x27;s asthma had severely affected his voice. Modestly received by a reviewer in &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot;, and described as &quot;pedestrian&quot; by Philip French in 2009, it was a hit in the North. In this film, Donat used his natural Mancunian accent, which his early elocution lessons had attempted to suppress completely.

Donat appeared on radio. In October 1949, he did a performance of &quot;Justice&quot; by John Galsworthy on &quot;Theatre Guild on the Air&quot; for America. Donat and Asherson also appeared in &quot;The Magic Box&quot; (1951), in which Donat played William Friese-Greene. However, his asthma continued to affect his ability to perform.

He was cast as Thomas Becket in T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Murder in the Cathedral&quot; in Robert Helpmann&#x27;s production at The Old Vic theatre in 1952 but, although his return to stage was well received, his illness forced him to withdraw during the run. For the same reason, he dropped out of the film &quot;Hobson&#x27;s Choice&quot; (1954). Scheduled to play Willy Mossop, he was replaced by John Mills. Author David Shipman speculates that Donat&#x27;s asthma may have been psychosomatic: &quot;His tragedy was that the promise of his early years was never fulfilled and that he was haunted by agonies of doubt and disappointment (which probably were the cause of his chronic asthma).&quot; David Thomson also suggested this explanation, and Donat himself thought that his illness had a 90% basis in his psychology. In a 1980 interview with Barry Norman, his first wife, Ella Annesley Voysey (by then known as Ella Hall), said that Donat had an asthma attack as a psychosomatic response to the birth of their daughter. According to her, &quot;Robert was full of fear&quot;.

&quot;Lease of Life&quot; (1954), made by Ealing Studios, was his penultimate film. In it, Donat played a vicar who discovers that he has a terminal illness. Donat&#x27;s final role was the Mandarin of Yang Cheng in &quot;The Inn of the Sixth Happiness&quot; (1958). His last words in the film, an emotional soliloquy in which the Mandarin confesses his conversion to Christianity, were prophetic: &quot;We shall not see each other again, I think. Farewell&quot;. It reduced Ingrid Bergman, playing the missionary Gladys Aylward, to tears. He had collapsed with a stroke during filming but managed to recover enough to complete the film.

==Personal life==

In 1929, Donat married Ella Annesley Voysey, niece of architect Charles Voysey. They had one daughter, Joanna Donat (born 1931) and two sons, John Donat (born 1933) and Brian Donat (born 1936), but divorced in 1946. 

On 4 May 1953, Donat married again, to actress Renée Asherson, born Dorothy Renee Ascherson, daughter of Charles Ascherson and Dorothy Lilian Wiseman. They lived at 8 The Grove, Highgate until their separation three years later, partly due to the severity of his asthma. They may have been close to a reconciliation when he died. She never remarried.

==Death==
Donat died at the West End Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in Soho, London, on 9 June 1958, aged 53. His biographer Kenneth Barrow said he had &quot;... a brain tumour the size of a duck egg and cerebral thrombosis was certified as the primary cause of death&quot;. His body was cremated privately in Marylebone three days after his death. He left an estate worth £25,236 ().

==Legacy==
Donat has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6420 Hollywood Blvd. A blue plaque also commemorates his life at 8 Meadway in Hampstead Garden Suburb. His place of birth, at 42 Everett Road in Withington, is commemorated by a similar plaque.

<text>In Roman mythology, Discordia is the Roman equivalent of the Greek Eris, goddess of strife and discord. She was the daughter of Nox (Night) and Erebus. Like Eris, Discordia has no mythology other than her involvement in the Judgement of Paris.

Unlike her opposite Concordia, Discordia was not a cult goddess, but simply a literary personification, and like Eris was especially associated with the strife and discord in war. She was, in particular, associated with Roman civil war.

==Family==
The Greek personification of strife and discord, Eris, according to Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, is the daughter of Nyx (Night) with no father.
Similarly, according to the &quot;Fabulae&quot;, Discordia is the daughter of Nox (Night), although it gives her father as Erebus. The &quot;Fabulae&quot; lists many siblings of Discord, similar to but different from the list of siblings of Eris as given by Hesiod. For example both are siblings of &quot;Old Age&quot; (the Greek Geras and Roman Senecus), &quot;Death&quot; (the Greek Thanatos and Roman Mors), the Fates (the Greek Moirai and Roman Parcae), and Nemesis (&quot;Indignation&quot;). However while the siblings of Eris are all negative personified abstractions, some of Discordia&#x27;s are positive, such as Euphrosyne (&quot;Cheerfulness&quot;), and Amicitia (&quot;Friendship&quot;), while others are not personified abstractions at all, such as the Giant Porphyrion, or Styx, the goddess and river of the Underworld. Also unlike Eris, Discordia has no children.

==Judgement of Paris==
The Roman story of Discordia&#x27;s involvement in the Judgement of Paris, is essentially the same as that of Eris. As told in the &quot;Fabulae&quot;, the story is as follows. All the gods, except Discordia, were invited by Jupiter to the wedding of Peleus and Thetis. She came anyway and was refused admission, so she threw an apple through the doorway, saying that the most beautiful should take it. The three goddesses, Juno, Venus, and Minerva each claimed the apple. This started the quarrel which led to the Judgement of Paris, and ultimately to the outbreak of the Trojan War.

==Latin literature==
Unlike her opposite, Concordia, Discordia was not a cult goddess, and was little more than a literary personification. As a personification of discord, she is a frequent occurrence in Latin epic poetry, and, and in particular, civil discord and civil war, through the first-century AD. In late antiquity Latin Christian literature, Discordia is contrasted with Concordia, with Discordia becoming a symbol of Christian discord and heresy.

===Second-century BC–first-century AD===
The Roman poet Ennius seems to have been the first to introduce &quot;loathsome Discord&quot; (&quot;Discordia taetra&quot;) when, in his second-century BC epic &quot;Annales&quot;, he describes Discordia as breaking open the &quot;portals of War&quot;. Virgil, in the &quot;Aeneid&quot; (first century BC), has &quot;maddening Strife (&quot;Discordia demens&quot;), her snaky locks entwined with bloody ribbons&quot; as one of the many terrible evils who reside at the entrance to his Underworld.

Discordia was particularly associated with Roman internal conflict and civil war. Like the Homeric Eris in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, who is one of the divinities active in the Trojan War, Virgil makes Discordia one of the divine participants (as depicted on the prophetic Shield of Aeneas) at the Battle of Actium, during the Roman civil war between Octavian and Mark Antony. In a battle of gods, with &quot;rent robe&quot;, Discordia &quot;strides exultant&quot;:

Discordia, under the influence of Virgil, appears in the works of the four later first-century AD Roman epic poets Lucan, Silius Italicus, Statius, and Valerius Flaccus. The word &quot;discordia&quot; (whether personified or not) appears seven times in Lucan&#x27;s &quot;Pharsalia&quot;, his epic poem about the decisive battle in Caesar&#x27;s civil war. Silius, in his epic &quot;Punica&quot; about the Second Punic War, begins his Battle of Cannae with Virgil&#x27;s &quot;maddening strife&quot; (&quot;Discordia demens&quot;) invading heaven and forcing &quot;the gods to fight&quot;. Statius involves Discordia (in the company of other personifications) in his &quot;Thebaid&quot; concerning the fraternal war, for the kingship of Thebes, between the two sons of Oedipus, Eteocles and Polynices. The &quot;Argonautica&quot;, Valerius&#x27; epic poem about Jason&#x27;s search for the Golden Fleece, where the theme of civil discord is pervasive, also mentions the goddess. In Book 2, Discordia, among other personifications, hurries to assist Venus (&quot;the Martian consort&quot;) to incite the women of Lemnos to make (civil) war on their husbands:

Later in Book 6, Valerius, describing the crashing chariots of the warring Colchian brothers Aeetes and Perses, has: &quot;the curved blades doth discord [&quot;discordia&quot;] entangle and lacerate the panic-stricken cars&quot;, then goes on to liken the battle between the two brothers to Roman civil war. While preparing Jason for his encounter with the Colchis Bulls, Medea handing him his helm says: &quot;take again this crested helm which Discord [&quot;Discordia&quot;] held but now in her death-bringing hand&quot;.

Discordia is also mentioned in non-epic poetry, also often associated with Roman civil war. She makes an appearance in a civil war parody in Petronius&#x27;s &quot;Satyricon&quot; (late first century AD), where she is described as follows:

Urging all to war—in particular several notable figures in Caesar&#x27;s civil war: Julius Caesar, Pompey the Great, Marcellus, Curio, Lentulus—Discordia:
===Early Fifth-century===
Discordia&#x27;s opposite, Concordia (&quot;Concord&quot;), the Roman equivalent of the Greek Harmonia (&quot;Harmony&quot;), was a Roman goddess who had a temple (the Temple of Concord) dedicated to her in the Roman Forum.
The opposition between &quot;concordia&quot; (concord) and &quot;discordia&quot; (discord), and their personifications Concordia and Discordia—a dichotomy made use of by Virgil in the &quot;Aeneid&quot;—becomes, for late antiquity Latin poets, &quot;something of an obsession&quot;.

Augustine, in his &quot;City of God&quot; (426 AD)—responding to the accusation that the 410 AD Sack of Rome was the result of Christianity and the failure to appease the pagan gods—argues that Rome&#x27;s pre-Christian history, which was rife with civil discord and civil war, might just as well be said to have been the result of Rome&#x27;s failure to appease Discordia. He notes that, following the dedication of the Temple of Concord in Rome, there was even worse civil discord, and remarks sarcastically that it would have been more appropriate for Rome to have built instead a &quot;temple to Discord&quot;. He goes on to ask &quot;why Concord should be a goddess, but Discord not&quot;, and—in what he describes as having &quot;our fun with such inanities&quot;— concludes that:
The opposition of Concordia and Discordia is particularly explicit in the Christian poet Prudentius&#x27;s early fifth-century allegory &quot;Psychomachia&quot; (&quot;Battle of the Soul&quot;), in which armies of personified Virtues and Vices do battle. Here the Vice Discordia becomes explicitly identified with religious heresy. After the army of Vices had been defeated, Discordia, in disguise, entered the camp of the celebrating Virtues, seeking to attack surreptitiously the &quot;greatest&quot; of the Virtues Concordia:
But Discordia is discovered, and with the army of Virtues, swords drawn, surrounding her and demanding to know &quot;her race and name, her country and her faith, what God she worships, of what nation he that sent her&quot;, she answers:
At which point Faith, the Virtues&#x27; queen, unwilling to hear any more of their &quot;outrageous prisoner’s blasphemies&quot;, stopped Discordia&#x27;s speech by driving a javelin through her tongue, and:
Martianus Capella (fl. c. 410–420), has Discordia, along with Seditio (Sedition) as being a deity of the third celestial region.

==Modern culture==
Discordia/Eris is an important figure within the new religious movement Discordianism.

<text>Mefistofele () is an opera in a prologue and five acts, later reduced to four acts and an epilogue, the only completed opera with music by the Italian composer-librettist Arrigo Boito (there are several completed operas for which he was librettist only). The opera was given its premiere on 5 March 1868 at La Scala, Milan, under the baton of the composer, despite his lack of experience and skill as a conductor.

However, it was not a success and was immediately withdrawn after only two performances both of which were hissed at by the audiences. Revisions in 1875 resulted in success in Bologna and, with further adjustments in 1876 for Venice, the opera was performed elsewhere.

==Composition history==

Boito began consideration of an opera on the Faustian theme after completing his studies at the Milan Conservatory in 1861. &quot;Mefistofele&quot; is one of many pieces of classical music based on the Faust legend and, like many other composers, Boito used Goethe&#x27;s version as his starting point. He was an admirer of Richard Wagner and, like him, chose to write his own libretto, something which was virtually unheard of in Italian opera up to that time. Much of the text is actually a literal translation from Goethe&#x27;s German to Boito&#x27;s Italian.

The most popular earlier opera based on the legend was Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;, which Boito regarded as a superficial and frivolous treatment of a profound subject. Furthermore, Boito was contemptuous of what he saw as the low operatic standards prevailing in Italy at that time, and he determined to make his new work distinctive, both musically and intellectually, different from anything that had been heard before. He hoped that it would be a wake-up call and an inspiration to other young Italian composers.

The piano–vocal score was completed in 1867 while Boito was visiting relatives in Poland.

==Performance history and revisions==

===19th century===

As the evening of 5 March 1868 premiere performance progressed, the hostility of the audience, unfamiliar with Boito&#x27;s avant-garde musical style and unimpressed by many of the scenes (notably the scene in the emperor&#x27;s court), steadily increased. Furthermore, the work was far too long and the cast inadequate for the complexities of the music. When the curtain finally came down well after midnight, it was clear that the premiere had been a failure. After just two performances, with the second one being divided into two sections and presented on successive evenings, the opera was withdrawn.

Boito immediately set to work revising his opera, greatly reduced its length by about one-third by making many scenes smaller in scale. The most important changes were the following: Boito removed the entire first scene of the original act 4 (scene in the imperial court), symphonic intermezzo &quot;La Battaglia&quot; and expanded act 5 as an epilogue, adding the duet &quot;Lontano, lontano&quot; to act 3 in the process. Faust was changed from a baritone to a tenor.

The revised version was premiered in Bologna on 4 October 1875, this time sung by what is generally regarded to be a very fine cast, and was an immediate success. This change in reception is thought to be partly due to Boito&#x27;s revisions making the opera more traditional in style, and also to the Italian audience having become familiar with, and more willing to accept, developments in opera associated with those of Richard Wagner.

Boito made further minor revisions during 1876, and this version was first performed at the Teatro Rossini in Venice on 13 May 1876. The first British performance took place at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, London on 6 July 1880 and the American premiere was on 16 November 1880 in Boston. Thereafter, Boito continued to make small changes until the final definitive production in Milan on 25 May 1881.

===20th century and beyond===

In the early 20th century, revivals of the opera were associated particularly with the famous Russian bass Feodor Chaliapin: he sang the title role on the occasion of his first appearance outside Russia (La Scala, Milan, 16 March 1901) and also on his North American debut (Metropolitan Opera, New York, 20 November 1907). Chaliapin made his first appearance at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, on 25 May 1926. Parts of a subsequent performance on 31 May were recorded by His Master&#x27;s Voice.

In 1969, the New York City Opera presented a new production by Tito Capobianco, with Norman Treigle scoring his greatest success in the title role.

The Metropolitan Opera has given the work from time to time since it first appeared there on 5 December 1883.The Royal Opera in London has only given one performance of the opera, a concert version in March 1998 at the Barbican Centre, with Samuel Ramey as the title character.

As &quot;Mefistofele&quot;, Ramey made the role a signature one, appearing in many productions in the 1980s and early 1990s, including one given by the San Francisco Opera in 1989 and another in November 1994. San Francisco Opera revived the 1994 production of the opera as the first production of its 2013/14 season with Ildar Abdrazakov as &quot;Mefistofele&quot;, Patricia Racette as Margherita and Ramón Vargas as Faust.

The opera was performed as part of the 2013/14 season at the Croatian National Theatre (HNK Split), directed by Michał Znaniecki and conducted by Nikša Bareza.

In August 2014, the opera was performed at the 13th Opera Festival of the Theatro da Paz in Belém, Brazil, after a 50-year hiatus from Brazilian theaters. There &quot;Mefistofele&quot; was played by Denis Sedov and Faust played by Fernando Portari.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Dutch National Opera&#x27;s performance of &quot;Mefistofele&quot; in 2020 could not go ahead as planned, so an alternative production of the work titled &quot;Faust [Working Title]&quot; was performed. The concept of this production was created by director Lisenka Heijboer Castañon and conductor Manoj Kamps, in which they invited composers and arrangers to respond to Boito&#x27;s original work. This included a new arrangement of Boito&#x27;s famous prison aria ‘L’altra notte in fondo al mare’ from &quot;Mefistofele&quot; arranged by the British composer Grace-Evangeline Mason for the Moldovan soprano Olga Busuioc who was an original cast member for the production.

==Roles==
==Synopsis==

===Prologue===
A heavenly chorus of angels praises God the Creator. Mefistofele scornfully declares that he can win the soul of Faust. His challenge is accepted by the Forces of Good.

===Act 1===
&quot;Scene 1, Easter Sunday&quot;

The aged Dr. Faust and his pupil Wagner are watching the Easter celebrations in the main square in Frankfurt. Faust senses that they are being followed by a mysterious friar, about whom he senses something evil. Wagner dismisses his master’s feelings of unease and as darkness falls they return to Faust’s home.

&quot;Scene 2, The Pact&quot;

Faust is in his study, deep in contemplation. His thoughts are disturbed in dramatic fashion by the sudden appearance of the sinister friar, whom he now recognizes as a manifestation of the Devil (Mefistofele). Far from being terrified, Faust is intrigued and enters into a discussion with Mefistofele culminating in an agreement by which he will give his soul to the devil on his death in return for worldly bliss for the remainder of his life.

===Act 2===
&quot;Scene 1, The Garden&quot;

Restored to his youth, Faust has infatuated Margareta, an unsophisticated village girl. She is unable to resist his seductive charms and agrees to drug her mother with a sleeping draught and meet him for a night of passion. Meanwhile, Mefistofele amuses himself with Martha, another of the village girls.

&quot;Scene 2, The Witches Sabbath&quot;

Mefistofele has carried Faust away to witness a Witches&#x27; Sabbath on the Brocken mountain. They reach to the top and hear the sound of witches approaching from below. They draw near and Mefistofele, declaring himself king, calls to them to bow down before him. The devil mounts his throne and proclaims his contempt for the World and all its worthless inhabitants. As the orgy reaches its climax, Faust sees a vision of Margherita, apparently in chains and with her throat cut. Mefistofele reassures him that the vision was a false illusion. The revels continue.

===Act 3===
Faust&#x27;s vision had been true. Margareta lies in a dismal cell, her mind in a state of confusion and despair. She has been imprisoned and condemned to death for poisoning her mother with the sleeping supplied by Faust and for drowning the baby she had borne him. Faust begs Mefistofele to help them escape together. They enter the cell and at first Margareta does not recognize her rescuers. Her joy at being reunited with Faust turns to horror when she sees Mefistofele and recognizes that he is the devil. Refusing to succumb to further evil, Margareta begs for divine forgiveness. She collapses to the cell floor as the Celestial choir proclaims her redemption.

===Act 4===
Mefistofele has now transported Faust back in time to Ancient Greece. Helen of Troy and her followers are enjoying the luxurious and exotic surroundings on the banks of a magnificent river. Faust, attired more splendidly than ever, is easily able to win the heart of the beautiful princess. In a passionate outpouring they declare their undying love and devotion to each other.

===Epilogue===
Back in his study, Faust, once more an old man, reflects that neither in the world of reality nor of illusion was he able to find the perfect experience he craved. He feels that the end of his life is close, but desperate for his final victory, Mefistofele urges him to embark on more exotic adventures. For a moment Faust hesitates, but suddenly seizing his Bible he cries out for God&#x27;s forgiveness. Mefistofele has been thwarted; he disappears into the background as Faust dies and the Celestial choir once more sings of ultimate redemption.

==Recordings==
==In popular culture==
&quot;Batman Begins&quot; depicts the opera being performed onstage, using an excerpt of &quot;Rampiamo, rampiamo, che il tempo ci gabba&quot; (Chorus of Warlocks and Witches from act 2, scene 2) from the 1973 EMI recording (see &quot;Recordings&quot; above). During the scene, performers dressed as bat-like monsters frighten young Bruce Wayne, who asks to leave.

An avant-garde video directed by Yevgeniy Timokhin on a remix with the verse &quot;E&#x27; mia madre addormentata&quot; from Margareta&#x27;s aria in act 3 was awarded the Euro Video Grand Prix 2006.

<text>Columbia, formerly [[Wright&#x27;s Ferry]], is a borough (town) in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, United States. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 10,222. It is southeast of Harrisburg, on the east (left) bank of the Susquehanna River, across from Wrightsville and York County and just south of U.S. Route 30.

The settlement was founded in 1726 by Colonial English Quakers from Chester County, led by entrepreneur and evangelist John Wright. Establishment of the eponymous Wright&#x27;s Ferry, the first commercial Susquehanna crossing in the region, inflamed territorial conflict with neighboring Maryland but brought growth and prosperity to the small town, which was just a few votes shy of becoming the new United States&#x27; capital.

Though besieged for a short while by Civil War destruction, Columbia remained a lively center of transport and industry throughout the 19th century, and was once the terminus of the Pennsylvania Canal. Later, however, the Great Depression and 20th-century changes in economy and technology sent the borough into economic decline. It is notable today as the site of one of the world&#x27;s few museums devoted entirely to horology.

==History==
=== Early history ===

The area around present-day Columbia was originally populated by Native American tribes, most notably the Susquehannocks, who migrated to the area between 1575 and 1600 after separating from the Iroquois Confederacy. They established villages just south of Columbia, in what is now Washington Boro, as well as claiming at least hunting lands as far south as Maryland and northern Virginia.
=== First Western settlements ===
In 1724, John Wright, an English Quaker, traveled to the Columbia area (then a part of Chester County) to explore the land and proselytize to a Native American tribe, the Shawnee, who had established a settlement along Shawnee Creek. Wright built a log cabin nearby on a tract of land first granted to George Beale by William Penn in 1699, and stayed for more than a year. The area was then known as &quot;Shawanatown&quot;.

When Wright returned in 1726 with companions Robert Barber and Samuel Blunston, they began developing the area, Wright building a house about a hundred yards from the edge of the Susquehanna River in the area of today&#x27;s South Second and Union streets. Susanna Wright later built Wright&#x27;s Ferry Mansion, what is now the oldest existing house in Columbia, dating to 1738. She lived in this house with her brother James and his wife Rhoda, and possibly the first of their many children. The home is open for tours as a house museum and is located at Second and Cherry streets.

Robert Barber constructed a sawmill in 1727 and later built a home near the river on the Washington Boro Pike, along what is now Route 441. The home still stands, across from the Columbia wastewater treatment plant, and is the second oldest in the borough (after Wright&#x27;s Ferry Mansion).

Samuel Blunston constructed a mansion called Bellmont atop the hill next to North Second Street, near Chestnut Street, at the location of the present-day Rotary Park playground. Upon his death, Blunston willed the mansion to Susanna Wright, who had become a close friend. She lived there, occasionally visiting brother James, ministering to the Native Americans, and raising silkworms for the local silk industry, until her death in 1784 at the age of 87. The residence was demolished in the late 1920s to allow for construction of the Veterans Memorial Bridge.

In 1729, after Wright had petitioned William Penn&#x27;s son to create a new county, the provincial government took land from Chester County to establish Lancaster County, the fourth county in Pennsylvania. County residents – Indians and colonists alike – regularly traveled to Wright&#x27;s home to file papers and claims, seek government assistance and redress of issues, and register land deeds. The area was particularly attractive to Pennsylvania Dutch settlers. During this time, the town was called &quot;Wright&#x27;s Ferry&quot;.

=== Wright&#x27;s Ferry ===

In 1730, John Wright was granted a patent to operate a ferry across the Susquehanna River, subsequently established (with Barber and Blunston) as Wright&#x27;s Ferry. He also built a ferry house and a two-story log tavern on the eastern shore, north of Locust Street, on Front Street.

The ferry itself originally consisted of two dugout canoes fastened together with carriage and wagon wheels and drawn by cattle. Crossings could be a dangerous enterprise. When several oxen were moved at once, the canoeist guided a lead animal with a rope so that the others would follow; if, however, the lead animal became confused and started swimming in circles, the other animals followed until they tired and eventually drowned.

Typical fares in the 1700s were:
* Coach with four passengers, drawn by five horses – nine shillings;
* Four-horse wagon – three shillings and nine pence;
* Man and horse – six pence
Fares were reduced in 1787 due to competition from Anderson&#x27;s Ferry, located further upstream near Marietta. Wright&#x27;s Ferry was located immediately south of the present-day Veterans Memorial Bridge along Route 462. In later years, Wright rented the ferry to others before finally selling it.

Traffic heading west from Lancaster, Philadelphia, and other nearby towns regularly traveled through Columbia, using the ferry to cross the Susquehanna. As traffic flow increased, the ferry grew, to the point of including canoes, rafts, flatboats, and eventually steamboats; it became capable of handling Conestoga wagons and other large vehicles. Due to the volume of traffic, however, wagons, freight, supplies and people often became backed up, creating a waiting period of several days to cross the river. With 150 to 200 vehicles lined up on the Columbia side, ferrymen used chalk to number the wagons.

=== Cresap&#x27;s War ===

Wright&#x27;s Ferry was the first convenient crossing of the Susquehanna River in the region. At the time, however, southern Pennsylvania above the 40th parallel was claimed by the Province of Maryland, which took especial interest in the rural area around the ferry. Fearing an influx of Pennsylvanian settlers that could weaken Maryland&#x27;s influence, Maryland colonist Thomas Cresap, under the aegis of Lord Baltimore, attempted to establish a competing ferry and a strong landholding presence around the Susquehanna. Pennsylvanians responded in kind; a violent attack on Cresap in October 1730 escalated the situation into a series of bitter (if not bloody) militia skirmishes and heated legal battles. The situation was not fully resolved until a London peace agreement in 1738, which cooled the colonies&#x27; territorial dispute and set the stage for the later codification of the Mason–Dixon line.

=== Becoming Columbia ===
Samuel Wright, son of James and Rhoda Wright, was born on May 12, 1754. He eventually became the town proprietor and created a public grounds company to administer the land. Through his trusteeship, the town&#x27;s first water distribution system (later the Columbia Water Company) was established, as well as the Washington Institute (the town&#x27;s first school of higher learning) and Locust Street Park, located at what is now Locust Street and Route 462.

In the spring of 1788, Samuel Wright had the area surveyed and formally laid out the town into 160 building lots, which were distributed by lottery at 15 shillings per ticket. &quot;Adventurers&quot;, as purchasers were known, included speculators from many areas of the country. Wright and town citizens renamed the town &quot;Columbia&quot; in honor of Christopher Columbus in the hope of influencing the new United States Congress to select it as the nation&#x27;s capital, a plan George Washington favored; a formal proposal to do so was made in 1789. Unfortunately for the town, when Congress voted in 1790, the final tally was one vote short. Later, Columbia narrowly missed becoming the capital of Pennsylvania; Harrisburg was chosen instead, since it was closer to the state&#x27;s geographic center.

===19th century===
====Expansion, construction, and transportation====

English Anglicans, Scots-Irish Presbyterians, freed African slaves, German Lutherans, and descendants of French Huguenots came to outnumber the first Quaker settlers within a generation.

Columbia became an incorporated borough in 1814, formed out of Hempfield Township. The same year, the world&#x27;s longest covered bridge was built across the Susquehanna to Wrightsville, facilitating traffic flow across the river and reducing the need for the ferry. The bridge was long and wide, and had 54 stone piers. After handling traffic across the Susquehanna for 18 years, it was destroyed by high water, ice, and severe weather in the winter of 1832. A replacement covered bridge, the Pennsylvania Railroad Bridge, was built within two years.

=====Public works=====
In February 1826, the Pennsylvania state legislature approved the package of legislation known as the Main Line of Public Works with the goal of connecting the width and breadth of Pennsylvania by the best and most reliable transportation known, water transport. The project started with the harder parts up the Juniata River and over the mountains being funded first. $300,000 in the funding was for the construction of a navigation that would be called the Pennsylvania Canal along the Susquehanna&#x27;s eastern shore to bypass rapids and shallows and make the river navigable anywhere along its route. Also, as conceived, another canal would be dug from the terminus in Columbia to connect towns to the east with a terminus on the Delaware River at Philadelphia. 
Across the Alleghenies, another canal would connect the Allegheny Portage Railroad (crossing the mountains) to the Ohio River and the Mississippi River, ensuring the Port of Philadelphia would dominate inland trade and manufacturing in the exploding trans-Appalachian territories. It was a brave, far-looking, ambitious vision. Like the Erie Canal which was completed in 1825, the very year the legislation package came to be filed, the overall scheme was envisioned when water transport was the fastest means of travel over any long distance, was the best way to ship heavy bulk goods or cumbersome loads—and was before railways came to the public eye and their technology had been refined enough to become working propositions. In 1836 there were probably fewer than six railways in the world.

The navigations began in 1832 after several delays, and the work proceeded quickly. The Pennsylvania Canal began operating in 1833, beginning in Columbia and then stretching north to the junction of the Juniata River with the Susquehanna River. The intent was that goods and travelers could use the canal system to go west from Columbia to Pittsburgh, Lake Erie, Ohio, and [present-day] West Virginia along the Juniata Division, or by taking the main Susquehanna north to reach north-central Pennsylvania and Upstate New York.

The plan encountered difficulties. Engineering studies found no reasonably feasible way to provide enough water to keep an 82-mile canal to Philadelphia wet, much less support lock operations. When that was reported, the Pennsylvania Canal Commission came up with a new plan, one using the right of way authorized to build one of these newfangled railways that were making news. Their solution was the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad, one of the first common carrier commercial railways to operate in the United States. Double-tracked, it utilized two inclined plane cable railways at steep rises near either end, and except for bypasses of that older technology unneeded with more powerful locomotives, the P&amp;CR trackage is still in use today, as it passed to the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1857, along with most of the Pennsylvania Canal.
Canal boats could often be seen at the Bruner coal wharf, operated by H.F. Bruner &amp; Sons at North Front and Bridge streets. The canal was originally planned to extend south from Columbia on the east side of the river, but local property owners objected. Instead, a two-tiered towpath was constructed along the south side of the bridge to transport boats across the river using horse and mule teams. The boats then linked with the Susquehanna and Tidewater Canal along the western shore at Wrightsville. This part of the canal system, which afforded passage to Baltimore or the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, opened in 1840. Several years later, a small dam was constructed across the river to form a pool that allowed steamboats to tow the canal boats. Canals could not be used in winter due to ice and floods, which caused damage that had to be repaired in the spring. These limitations, combined with an increase in railroad traffic, led to the decline of the canals. The Columbia Canal closed in 1901, the same year that Wright&#x27;s Ferry ceased to operate.

During this time, Columbia also became a stop on the Underground Railroad. Slaves seeking freedom were transported across the Susquehanna, fed and given supplies on their way north to other states and Canada. To slave hunters from the South, the slaves seemed to simply disappear, leading one hunter to declare that there &quot;must be an underground railroad here.&quot;

Any idealistic view of abolitionism in Columbia is surely tested, however, by the occurrence of a significant race riot in 1834. The riot erupted in August of that year when white workers revolted against working alongside Black freedmen. Citing a document drafted by the rioters themselves, historian David Roediger explains that typical of other race riots of the period, white rioters feared &quot;a plot by employers and abolitionists to open new trades to Blacks and &#x27;to break down the distinctive barrier between the colors that the poor whites may gradually sink into the degraded condition of the Negroes - that, like them, they may be slaves and tools&#x27;.&quot; The rioters&#x27; declaration called for &quot;colored freeholders&quot; to be &quot;singled out for removal from the Borough&quot;. The riot resulted in a large number of African American residents being forced from their homes and their property destroyed.

In 1834, another bridge was built by James Moore and John Evans at a cost of $157,300 (~$ in ). This bridge also enjoyed the distinction of being the world&#x27;s longest covered bridge. The same year, construction began on the first railway line linking Columbia and Philadelphia, which subsequently became part of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Named the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad, it officially opened in October 1834.

By 1852, regular rail transportation from Columbia to Baltimore, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Harrisburg made the town the commercial center for the area halfway between the county seats of Lancaster and York.

====Civil War====
In early 1863, as the American Civil War raged, a number of local Black citizens enlisted in the 54th Massachusetts Infantry, a regiment composed of black soldiers serving under white officers. The unit achieved fame in an assault on Fort Wagner in South Carolina. Stephen Swails, one of its members, may have been the first African-American officer commissioned during the Civil War. Other local citizens fought in various regiments of the United States Colored Troops. Some of these veterans are buried in a cemetery located near Fifth Street.

On June 28, 1863, during the Gettysburg campaign, the replacement covered bridge was burned by Columbia residents and the Pennsylvania state militia to prevent Confederate soldiers of the Army of Northern Virginia from entering Lancaster County. General Robert E. Lee had hoped to invade Harrisburg from the rear and move eastward to Lancaster and Philadelphia, and in the process destroy railroad yards and other facilities. Under General Jubal A. Early&#x27;s command and following Lee&#x27;s orders, General John B. Gordon was to place Lancaster and the surrounding farming area &quot;under contribution&quot; for the Confederate Army&#x27;s war supplies and to attack Harrisburg from the east side of the river, while another portion of Lee&#x27;s army advanced from the west side. General Early was given orders to burn the bridge but hoped instead to capture it, while Union forces under the command of Colonel Jacob G. Frick and Major Granville O. Haller, hoping to save the bridge, were forced to burn it. Owners of the bridge petitioned Congress repeatedly for reimbursement well into the 1960s, but were denied payment.

With the Union Army of the Potomac hastening northward into Maryland and Pennsylvania, Robert E. Lee ordered his widely scattered forces to withdraw to Heidlersburg and Cashtown (not far from Gettysburg) to rendezvous with other contingents of the Confederate Army. The burning of the Columbia–Wrightsville Bridge thwarted one of Lee&#x27;s goals for the invasion of Pennsylvania, and General Gordon later claimed the skirmish at Wrightsville reinforced the erroneous Confederate belief that the only defensive forces on hand were inefficient local militia, an attitude that carried over to the first day of the Battle of Gettysburg.

====Postwar growth====
After the wartime bridge burning, a tugboat, &quot;Columbia&quot;, was used to tow canal boats across the river. In 1868, yet another replacement covered bridge was built, but was destroyed by a hurricane in 1896. The next bridge, the Pennsylvania Railroad Bridge, was a steel open bridge which carried the tracks of the Pennsylvania Railroad and a two-lane roadway for cars. It was dismantled for scrap by November 1964, but its stone piers, which supported the Civil War-era bridge, can still be seen today, running parallel to the Veterans Memorial Bridge on Route 462. The piers have become the site of present-day &quot;Flames Across the Susquehanna&quot; bridge-burning reenactments sponsored by Rivertownes PA USA.

In 1875, a new three-story grand town hall opened, featuring a second-floor auditorium that seated over 900 and was used as an opera house. The second floor&#x27;s ceiling was higher than those of the first and third floors; each level contained 60 windows. The building also included office shops, council chambers, storerooms and market stalls. A bell tower, holding the town clock, crowned the building. The clock was visible from all over the borough, and its bell was audible throughout the surrounding countryside. The building was destroyed by fire in February 1947, but was rebuilt as a one-story municipal building that exists today.

Trolley service for the borough and surrounding area was established in 1893, allowing Columbians to take advantage of economic opportunities in Lancaster and other nearby towns. Between 1830 and 1900, the borough&#x27;s population increased from 2,046 to 12,316.

====Flourishing industry====
By the mid-19th century, Columbia had become a busy transportation hub with its ferry, bridge, canal, railroad and wharves. It was a major shipping transfer point for lumber, coal, grain, pig iron, and people. Important industries of the time included warehousing, tobacco processing, iron production, clockmaking, and boat building. Prominent local companies included the Ashley and Bailey Silk Mill, the Columbia Lace Mill, and H.F. Bruner &amp; Sons.

From about 1854 to 1900, an industrial complex existed in and around Columbia, Marietta and Wrightsville that included 11 anthracite iron furnaces and related structures, as well as canal and railroad facilities servicing them. By 1887, that number had grown to 13 blast furnaces, all operating within a radius of Columbia. The furnaces, which produced pig iron, exemplified the technology of the day through their use of anthracite coal and hot blast for smelting iron ore, a process that dominated the iron industry before the widespread use of coke as a fuel. Since northeastern Pennsylvania was a rich source of anthracite coal, anthracite-fired furnaces using locally available iron ores were built throughout eastern Pennsylvania, helping to make the state a leader in iron production in the latter half of the 19th century. Lancaster County also became a leader in pig iron production during this time, with the river towns&#x27; complex of furnaces contributing significantly to its output.

====Changes in the new century====
By 1900, the town&#x27;s population had grown to over 12,000, with a 50% increase from 1880 to 1900. Some of the items produced by its industries were silk goods, lace, pipe, laundry machinery, stoves, iron toys, flour, lumber, and wagons. By this time Wright&#x27;s Ferry had ceased its operations, having been supplanted by rail and bridge traffic.

In 1930, yet another bridge, the Veterans Memorial Bridge, was opened to improve traffic flow across the Susquehanna. It first opened as a toll bridge; to avoid the toll, in the coldest winter months some daring motorists would cross on the firmly frozen river. Later that same decade, many of the city&#x27;s brick sidewalks were converted to concrete; the bronze plaques of the concrete installers are still visible today.

====Economic decline====
The start of the 20th century brought economic challenge to Columbia as local industries declined. The lumber industry eventually disappeared as surrounding woodlands became depleted. As Chestnut Hill iron ores became scarce as well, the iron furnaces shut down. Eventually, the steel rolling mills also ceased operation. In 1906, the Pennsylvania Railroad opened a new facility in Enola, across the river from Harrisburg, which decreased the significance of Columbia&#x27;s railroad. By 1920, the population had dropped over 10% to 10,836.

The Great Depression accelerated Columbia&#x27;s economic slide. The Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s service to the north and the south was eliminated. World War II increased employment, but did not bring long-term prosperity to the borough.

By 1960, population had returned to its 1900 level. In 1965 a detailed study of Columbia&#x27;s basic strengths and weaknesses was released, but its suggestions went mostly unheeded. The Wright&#x27;s Ferry Bridge, which opened in 1972, only served to divert traffic around Columbia. The growth and prosperity experienced in some Lancaster County towns bypassed Columbia for the remainder of the 20th century. Although the United States Census Bureau reported that as of the last year of the 20th century, the population of Columbia had been only 10,311 people, by 2010 this figure had grown to 10,400.

<text>Denver is a borough in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 3,794 at the 2020 census, a decline from the figure of 3,861 tabulated in 2010.

==History==

Denver was founded by in 1735, by Hans Bucher, a Swiss immigrant. It was originally known as &quot;Bucher&#x27;s Thal&quot;, or &quot;Bucher Valley&quot;, in reference to the adjacent Cocalico Creek. In the mid-18th century, a gristmill was built along the creek, and by 1772 six dwellings had been built. A blacksmith shop and a sawmill were operating by 1820. Early advantages for the settlement were fertile soils and the limestone formations that were mined for the manufacture of mortar, plaster and whitewash. In the 1830s, settler John Bucher became an advocate for using the lime as a fertilizer. Several limestone quarries were in turn operating by the 1850s.

During the Civil War, the Reading and Columbia Railroad built a line through town, prompting a name change to &quot;Union Station&quot;. With time, residents grew weary being referred to as a train station. After researching post offices in the country, Adam Brubaker found only one named Denver. On November 1, 1881, the town was officially renamed Denver.

By the late 19th century, continued growth had some residents considering incorporating as a borough. The tipping point was a major fire at the Denver House, a tavern built behind the train station in 1868. Water from a local well and the nearby Cocalico Creek was insufficient to fight the fire, prompting tobacco merchant Aaron Shirk, physician W.D. Fink and businessman Ephraim Renninger to press for incorporation, so a municipal water system could be created. The trio filed an application for incorporation in April 1900, and by that December, Denver Borough had come into being. It originally encompassed , about a quarter its current size.

With the turn of the century, the new borough purchased a reservoir site and constructed a water plant, which went online in 1902. By 1906, the one quarry still in operation today just outside Denver was opened in 1906 by Abram G. Kurtz. Around the time Denver was incorporated, cigar making was the dominant industry in the area, but mechanization eventually doomed the trade in hand-rolling cigars. New industries sprouted up, including the F&amp;M Hat Company, founded in 1912 by brothers Samuel and Daniel Fichthorn along with their brother-in-law Ambrose Marburger. F&amp;M Hat quickly grew into the town&#x27;s largest employer, giving generations of residents jobs in its factory. By 1939 there were 835 employees working two shifts.

In 1977, the Cocalico Eagles boys basketball team, under the direction of coach Ed McIlmoyle, defeated Mercer, 75–59, in the PIAA Class AA state championship game.

Bucher&#x27;s Mill Covered Bridge, south of Denver near Reamstown, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

In 2003, the body of Jon Luna, an Assistant United States Attorney, was found in Denver.

<doc id="84895" wikidata="Q1228338" url="?curid=84895" title="Dis Pater">
<text>Dis Pater (; ; genitive &quot;Ditis Patris&quot;), otherwise known as Rex Infernus or [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], is a Roman god of the underworld. Dis was originally associated with fertile agricultural land and mineral wealth, and since those minerals came from underground, he was later equated with the chthonic deities Pluto (Hades) and Orcus.

Dis Pater&#x27;s name was commonly shortened to Dis, and this name has since become an alternative name for the underworld or a part of the underworld, such as the City of Dis of Dante&#x27;s &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;, which comprises Lower Hell.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Dis&quot; is a contraction of the Latin adjective &quot;dives&quot; (&#x27;wealthy, rich&#x27;), probably derived from &quot;divus, dius&quot; (&#x27;godlike, divine&#x27;) via the form &quot;*deiu-(o)t-&quot; or &quot;*deiu-(e)t-&quot; (&#x27;who is like the gods, protected by/from the gods&#x27;). The occurrence of the deity Dis together with &quot;Pater&quot; (&#x27;father&#x27;) may be due to association with &quot;Di(e)spiter&quot; (Jupiter).

Cicero gave a similar etymology in &quot;De Natura Deorum&quot;, suggesting the meaning &#x27;father of riches&#x27;, and comparing the deity to the Greek name Pluto (&quot;Plouton&quot;, Πλούτων), meaning &quot;the rich one&quot;, a title bestowed upon the Greek god Hades.

==Mythology==

Dis Pater eventually became associated with death and the underworld because mineral wealth such as gems and precious metals came from underground, wherein lies the realm of the dead, i.e. Hades&#x27; (Pluto&#x27;s) domain.

In being conflated with Pluto, Dis Pater took on some of the latter&#x27;s mythological attributes, being one of the three sons of Saturn (Greek Cronus) and Ops (Greek Rhea), along with Jupiter (Greek Zeus) and Neptune (Greek Poseidon). He ruled the underworld and the dead beside his wife, Proserpina (Greek Persephone). In literature, Dis Pater&#x27;s name was commonly used as a symbolic and poetic way of referring to death itself.

Dis Pater was sometimes identified with the Sabine god Soranus. Julius Caesar, in his &quot;Commentaries on the Gallic Wars&quot; (&quot;VI&quot;:18), states that the Gauls all claimed descent from Dis Pater. This is an example of &quot;interpretatio romana&quot;: what Caesar meant was that the Gauls all claimed descent from a Gaulish god that he equated with the Roman Dis Pater. The identification of Gaulish Dis Pater has posed problems for scholars. 

A scholium on the Pharsalia equates Dis Pater with Taranis, the Gaulish god of thunder. In southern Germany and the Balkans, Aericura was considered a consort of Dis Pater.

==Worship==
In 249 BC and 207 BC, the Roman Senate under senator Lucius Catellius ordained special festivals to appease Dis Pater and Proserpina. Every hundred years, a festival was celebrated in his name. According to legend, a round marble altar, &quot;Altar of Dis Pater and Proserpina&quot; (), was miraculously discovered by the servants of a Sabine called Valesius, the ancestor of the first consul. The servants were digging in the Tarentum on the edge of the Campus Martius to lay foundations following instructions given to Valesius&#x27;s children in dreams, when they found the altar underground. Valesius reburied the altar after three days of games. Sacrifices were offered to this altar during the &quot;Ludi Saeculares&quot; or &quot;Ludi Tarentini&quot;. It may have been uncovered for each occasion of the games, to be reburied afterwards, a clearly chthonic tradition of worship. It was rediscovered in 1886–1887 beneath the Corso Vittorio Emanuele in Rome.

<doc id="84896" wikidata="Q860314" url="?curid=84896" title="Orcus">
<text>Orcus was a god of the underworld, punisher of broken oaths in Etruscan and Roman mythology. As with Hades, the name of the god was also used for the underworld itself. Eventually, he was conflated with Dis Pater and Pluto.

A temple to Orcus may once have existed on the Palatine Hill in Rome. It is likely that he was transliterated from the Greek daemon Horkos, the personification of oaths and a son of Eris.

==Origins==

The origins of Orcus may have lain in Etruscan religion. The so-called &quot;Tomb of Orcus&quot;, an Etruscan site at Tarquinia, is a misnomer, resulting from its first discoverers mistaking a hairy, bearded giant for Orcus; it actually depicts a Cyclops.

The Romans sometimes conflated Orcus with other underworld gods such as Pluto, Hades, and Dis Pater. The name &quot;Orcus&quot; seems to have referred specifically to the malicious and punishing side of the ruler of the underworld, as the god who tormented evildoers in their afterlife. Like the name Hades, &quot;Orcus&quot; could refer both to the underworld itself, as well as its ruling deity. In the charitable interpretation for such a place, it was believed to be an abode for purification of the souls of the deceased.

Orcus was chiefly worshipped in rural areas; he had no official cult in the cities. This remoteness allowed for him to survive in the countryside long after the more prevalent gods had ceased to be worshipped. He survived as a folk figure into the Middle Ages, and aspects of his worship may have been transmuted into the wild man festivals held in rural parts of Europe through the modern era. Indeed, much of what is known about the celebrations associated with Orcus come from medieval sources.

==Persistence and later usage==

From Orcus&#x27;s association with death and the underworld, his name came to be used for demons and other underworld monsters, particularly in Italian where &quot;orco&quot; refers to a kind of monster found in fairy-tales that feeds on human flesh.

The French word &quot;ogre&quot; (appearing first in Charles Perrault&#x27;s fairy-tales) may have come from variant forms of this word, &quot;orgo&quot; or &quot;ogro&quot;; in any case, the French &quot;ogre&quot; and the Italian &quot;orco&quot; are exactly the same sort of creature.

===Ariosto===
An early example of an &quot;orco&quot; appears in Ludovico Ariosto&#x27;s &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; (1516), as a bestial, blind, tusk-faced monster inspired by the Cyclops of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;.

===Tolkien===
The &quot;orco&quot; from &quot;Orlando&quot;, along with the Old English word &quot;orc&quot; (in the sense of an ogre, like Grendel), was part of the inspiration for Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;orcs&quot; in his &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. In other manuscripts Tolkien wrote a side-note on the word:
:The word used in translation of Q &quot;urko&quot;, S &quot;orch&quot;, is orc. But that is because of the similarity of the ancient English word orc, &#x27;evil spirit or bogey&#x27;, to the Elvish words. There is possibly no connexion between them. The English word is now generally supposed to be derived from Latin Orcus.

In an unpublished letter sent to Gene Wolfe, Tolkien also made this comment:
:Orc I derived from Anglo-Saxon, a word meaning demon, usually supposed to be derived from the Latin Orcus – Hell. But I doubt this, though the matter is too involved to set out here.

From this use, countless other fantasy games and works of fiction have borrowed the concept of the orc.

<text>Hempfield is an unincorporated community in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, United States. Hempfield is a tiny locale in West Hempfield Township, a few miles west of Lancaster, the county seat.

==History==
Hempfield Township was one of the original townships set off when the boundaries of Lancaster County were surveyed in 1729. At that time, it included the present areas of East Hempfield Township, West Hempfield Township, Manor Township, and the Boroughs of Columbia, Mountville, and East Petersburg.

==Etymology==

Hempfield is said to be so named on account of the hemp fields formerly located in the area.

<doc id="84898" wikidata="Q2562872" url="?curid=84898" title="Intercourse, Pennsylvania">
<text>Intercourse is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Leacock Township, Lancaster County, in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania, east of Lancaster on Pennsylvania Route 340. As of the 2020 census, the population was 1,494, up from 1,274 at the previous census. It is about 8 miles away from Blue Ball, a town with a similarly unusual name.

Intercourse is a popular site for tourists because of its location in Amish country and its sexually suggestive name. The movie &quot;Witness&quot; was filmed in Intercourse as well as other parts of the surrounding area, and &quot;For Richer or Poorer&quot; was set there, though not filmed in Intercourse. Because of the town&#x27;s unusual name, the sign posts for the town are frequently targeted by thieves.

==History==
Intercourse was founded in 1754. The community was originally named &quot;Cross Keys&quot;, after a local tavern. Intercourse became the name in 1814. The village website gives several theories for the origins of the name:
Another theory concerns two famous roads that crossed here. The Old King&#x27;s highway from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh (now the Old Philadelphia Pike) ran east and west through the center of the town. The road from Wilmington to Erie intersected in the middle. The joining of these two roads is claimed by some to be the basis for the town &#x27;Cross Keys&#x27; or eventually &#x27;Intercourse&#x27;. A final idea comes from the use of language during the early days of the village. The word &#x27;intercourse&#x27; was commonly used to describe the &#x27;fellowship&#x27; and &#x27;social interaction and support&#x27; shared in the community of faith, which was much a part of a rural village like this one.

Another theory is that it is derived from a racecourse on the edge of town called &quot;Entercourse&quot;.

==Geography==
Intercourse is located in east-central Lancaster County, in the center of Leacock Township. Pennsylvania Route 340 (Old Philadelphia Pike) passes through the center of town, leading west to Lancaster, the county seat, and east to Downingtown. Pennsylvania Route 772 (East and West Newport Road) joins PA 340 for two blocks in the center of town; it leads northwest to Leola and southeast to Gap.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Intercourse CDP has a total area of , of which , or 0.04%, are water. Muddy Run, a westward-flowing tributary of Conestoga River, forms the northern edge of the community.

Intercourse has a hot-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dfa&quot;) like the remainder of Lancaster County. Average monthly temperatures range from in January to in July. The local hardiness zone is 6b.

==Demographics==
According to the 2020 &quot;ACS 5-Year Estimates Data Profiles&quot;, 41.0% of the township&#x27;s population spoke only English, while 51.6 spoke an &quot;other [than Spanish] Indo-European language&quot; (mostly being Pennsylvania German/German).

==Economy==
Tourism and farming are major industries in the area. Small businesses sell Amish crafts and food and give horse and buggy rides. The town thrives on thousands of tourists who visit the region each year. Most of the land surrounding the town is farmland.

==In popular culture==
The village&#x27;s name is often the subject of jokes relating to sexual intercourse. Along with that of Blue Ball, Pennsylvania, which could be mistaken for the slang term &quot;blue balls,&quot; a term for a temporary testicular and prostate fluid congestion due to prolonged and unsatisfied sexual excitement, the publishers of &quot;Eros Magazine&quot; sought mailing privileges from the postmasters of the town. Intercourse and Blue Ball are often named in lists of &quot;delightfully-named towns&quot; in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, along with Gap, Fertility, Mount Joy, Lititz, Bareville, Bird-in-Hand and Paradise. The village&#x27;s name has also been a source for humor on the Mennonite satire website &quot;The Daily Bonnet&quot;, in the episode ‘’The Old Man and the &quot;C&quot; Student’’ of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; as well as an episode of &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;.

===Transportation===
Pennsylvania Routes 772 (West Orange and East Main streets) and 501 (Broad Street) run through Lititz.

The Reading and Columbia Railroad operated passenger service through downtown Lititz until 1952. Norfolk Southern continues to operate freight service to Lancaster, while the line between Lititz and Ephrata has been converted into a rail trail. A replica of the Lititz Depot was constructed at its former location in Lititz Springs Park in 1999, along with a small museum in a Reading caboose.

Bus service in Lititz is provided by Red Rose Transit Route 10, the successor of the Conestoga Traction Company trolley line to Lancaster along the Lititz Pike.

<doc id="84900" wikidata="Q1367680" url="?curid=84900" title="Juventas">
<text>Juventas, also known as Iuventus or Juventus
(Greek equivalent: Hebe), was the ancient Roman goddess whose sphere of tutelage was youth and rejuvenation. She was especially the goddess of young men &quot;new to wearing the toga&quot; &quot;(dea novorum togatorum)&quot;—that is, those who had just come of age.

Several voluntary associations &quot;(collegia)&quot; were formed for Juventas in the Italian municipalities, as attested by inscriptions.

==Temple and early cult==
Juventas had a shrine within the cella of Minerva on the Capitoline. According to Dionysius and Livy, both she and the god Terminus are supposed to have &quot;refused&quot; the ceremony of reversal &quot;(exauguratio)&quot; performed when Tarquin wished to rebuild the temple district on the Capitoline. Although other deities were relocated, these two were incorporated into the new structure. Dionysius also records that the semi-legendary king Servius Tullius established a temple fund for Juventas, to which each family had to contribute. The view that she was a part of archaic Roman religion depends mainly on these two aetiological legends, as she has no presence in the early history of Roman festivals.

On the advice of the Sibylline books, which were consulted amid anxieties surrounding the Second Punic War, Juventas was included in sacrifices in 218 BC relating to a lectisternium, a public banquet at which divine images were displayed as if the deities were participating. Like other deities whose cult was ordained by the Sibylline books, Juventas was venerated &quot;ritu graeco&quot;, according to &quot;Greek&quot; rite. Also at the lectisternium of 218 BC, a supplication was performed at the Temple of Hercules. In Greek myth, the divinized Hercules had Hebe as his wife. The cultivation of both deities at the time of the Second Punic War seems intended to reinvigorate men of fighting age: Juventas &quot;was regarded as a powerful divine force rendering a vital gift of strength at a critical moment.&quot; This occasion is also the first time the &quot;Genius Publicus&quot; (&quot;Genius of the People&quot;) is recorded. After the disastrous Battle of Lake Trasimene in April 217 BC, Juventas, Hercules, and the Genius Publicus were excluded for a time from divine honors, as they were not felt to have been efficacious. Marcus Livius Salinator vowed a temple to her during the Battle of the Metaurus, when he faced Hasdrubal in 207 BC—an indication that Juventas was still felt to have potency.

A procession &quot;(supplicia canum)&quot; in which Romans carried crucified dogs passed between the Temple of Juventas and that of Summanus. A late source dates the &quot;punishment of the dogs&quot; to August 3.

==Imperial era==
On Imperial coins, Juventas and Spes (&quot;Hope&quot;) are often associated with the reigning Caesar.
A supplication to Juventas and Spes marked the anniversary of Augustus&#x27;s coming of age. Juventas was among the many &quot;Virtutes&quot; (&quot;Virtues&quot;) to appear on the coinage of Antoninus Pius.

<text>Marietta is a borough in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 2,633 at the 2020 census. It is located on the east bank of the Susquehanna River, northwest of Columbia.

==History==
In 1727, James Anderson made a lottery that laid out part of present-day Marietta. Later David Cook laid another portion of present-day Marietta. Further development by Jacob Grosh, John Myers, John Peadan, James Mehaffey, Benjamin Long, and James Huffy laid out the rest of present-day Marietta. In 1812, the borough was incorporated, merging all the areas of town except for the western portion of the borough which was extended into Marietta at a later date.

For the first few years of existence, the growth of the borough was meager. Then an economic crisis struck the town, not relenting until around 1830. Thereafter, industries such as timber and iron smelting provided many economic opportunities in the borough.

The borough&#x27;s name is an amalgamation of the first names of Mary Cook and Etta Anderson, the wives of two first settlers.

<text>Neffsville is an unincorporated community in Manheim Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, United States. As an unincorporated area, Neffsville has no formalized boundaries. The U.S. Geological Survey locates Neffsville at 40°6&#x27;0&quot;N 76°18&#x27;20&quot;W.

The retail and restaurant center of Neffsville is near 2500 Lititz Pike (Pennsylvania Route 501). Lancaster, the county seat, is to the south, and Lititz is to the north. Pennsylvania Route 722 leads west to East Petersburg and east to Pennsylvania Route 272 at Oregon.

Manheim Township School District serves 5,400 students with 637 employees, 423 of them holding teaching certificates. Manheim Township High School on School Road is considered to be in Neffsville.

==History==
According to local tradition, Neffsville was named for the family of Johan Christian Neff, originally from Gerolsheim, Germany, who was aboard the ship &quot;Lydia&quot; when she arrived in Philadelphia on September 19, 1743. Neff moved to Lampeter Township in Lancaster County, married the former Frena Howery, and they had three children there - Christian in 1750, Henry in 1754, and Esther in 1757. All three married in Lancaster County, but Christian&#x27;s life ended in Westmore County, and Esther&#x27;s in Lebanon County. An elementary school on School Road was named for Henry Holt.

== Shank&#x27;s extracts==

Jacob Shank, a Neffsville pharmacist, introduced &quot;Shank&#x27;s Compound Flavoring of Vanilla Bean&quot; in 1899 to improve the taste of his medicines. The product is still made today, and Shank&#x27;s is now the second-largest primary vanilla supplier in North America, as well as supplying other extracts, flavorings and spices. The Shanks family sold the business in 1959, and it is no longer in Neffsville, but many collectors prize their old extract bottles that read &quot;Shank&#x27;s Extracts - Neffsville, Pa.&quot;

<text>Hippo Regius (also known as Hippo or Hippone) is the ancient name of the modern city of Annaba, Algeria. It served as an important city for the Phoenicians, Berbers, Romans, and Vandals. Hippo was the capital city of the Vandal Kingdom from AD 435 to 439, after which it was shifted to Carthage following the Vandal capture of Carthage in 439.

It was the focus of several early Christian councils and home to Augustine of Hippo, a Church Father highly important in Western Christianity.

== History ==
Hippo is the latinization of (), probably related to the word &quot;ûbôn&quot;, meaning &quot;harbor&quot;. The town was first settled by Phoenicians from Tyre around the 12th centuryBC. To distinguish it from Hippo Diarrhytus (the modern Bizerte, in Tunisia), the Romans later referred to it as Hippo Regius (&quot;the Royal Hippo&quot;) because it was one of the residences of the Numidian kings. Its nearby river was Latinized as the Ubus and the bay to its east was known as Hippo Bay ().

A maritime city near the mouth of the river Ubus, it became a Roman colonia which prospered and became a major city in Roman Africa. It served as the bishopric of Saint Augustine of Hippo in his later years. In AD 430, the Vandals advanced eastwards along the North African coast and laid siege to the walled city of Hippo Regius. Inside, Saint Augustine and his priests prayed for relief from the invaders, knowing full well that the fall of the city would spell death or conversion to the Arian confession for much of the Christian population. On 28 August 430, three months into the siege, St. Augustine (who was 75 years old) died, perhaps from starvation or stress, as the wheat fields outside the city lay dormant and unharvested. Hunger and the inevitable diseases were ravaging both the city inhabitants and the Vandals outside the city walls who lifted the siege after 14 months. The peace treaty of 435 acknowledged the Vandals&#x27; possession of the city and King Geiseric made it the first capital of the Vandal Kingdom until the capture of Carthage in 439.

It was conquered by the Eastern Roman Empire in 534 and was kept under Roman rule until 698, when it fell to the Muslims; the Arabs rebuilt the town in the eighth century. The city&#x27;s later history is treated under its modern (Arabic and colonial) names.

About three kilometres distant in the eleventh century, the Berber Zirids established the town of &quot;Beleb-el-Anab&quot;, which the Spaniards occupied for some years in the sixteenth century, as the French did later, in the reign of Louis XIV. France took this town again in 1832. It was renamed Bône or Bona, and became one of the government centres for the Constantine (departement) in Algeria. It had 37,000 inhabitants, of whom 10,800 were original inhabitants, consisting of 9,400 Muslims and 1,400 naturalized Jews. 15,700 were French and 10,500 foreigners, including many Italians.

== Ecclesiastical history ==
Hippo was an ancient bishopric, one of many suffragans in the former Roman province of Numidia, a part of the residential see of Constantine. It contains some ancient ruins, a hospital built by the Little Sisters of the Poor and a fine basilica dedicated to St. Augustine. Under St. Augustine there were at least three monasteries in the diocese besides the episcopal monastery.

The diocese was established around 250 AD. Only these six bishops of Hippo are known:
* Saint Theogenes(256? – martyr 259?)
* Saint Leontius (died 303?)
* Fidentius (martyr ?304)
* Valerius (388?–396), who ordained St. Augustine
* the &quot;Doctor of Grace&quot;, Saint Augustine (354 – 28 August 430, coadjutor in 395, bishop in 396)
* Heraclius (coadjutor in 426, bishop in 430).

It was suppressed around 450 AD.

=== Council of Hippo ===

Three church councils were held at Hippo (393, 394, 426) and more synods – also in 397 (two sessions, June and September) and 401, all under Aurelius.

The synods of the Ancient (North) African church were held, with but few exceptions (e.g. Hippo, 393; Milevum, 402) at Carthage. We know from the letters of Saint Cyprian that, except in time of persecution, the African bishops met at least once a year, in the springtime, and sometimes again in the autumn. Six or seven synods, for instance, were held under St. Cyprian&#x27;s presidency during the decade of his administration (249–258), and more than fifteen under Aurelius (391–429). The Synod of Hippo of 393 ordered a general meeting yearly, but this was found too onerous for the bishops, and in the Synod of Carthage (407) it was decided to hold a general synod only when necessary for the needs of all Africa, and it was to be held at a place most convenient for the purpose. Not all the bishops of the country were required to assist at the general synod. At the Synod of Hippo (393) it was ordered that &quot;dignities&quot; should be sent from each ecclesiastical province. Only one was required from Tripoli (in Libya), because of the poverty of the bishops of that province. At the Synod of Hippo (393), and again at the Synod of 397 at Carthage, a list of the books of Holy Scripture was drawn up, and these books are still regarded as the constituents of the Catholic canon.

=== Titular episcopal see ===
The Hippo(ne) diocese was nominally revived in 1400 as Catholic Latin titular bishopric of the (lowest) episcopal rank, for which no incumbent is recorded.

It ceased to exist on 23 September 1867, when the see was formally united with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Constantine.

According to Virgil, Somnus was the brother of Death (Mors), and according to Ovid, Somnus had a &#x27;thousand&#x27; sons, the Somnia (&#x27;dream shapes&#x27;), who appear in dreams &#x27;mimicking many forms&#x27;. Ovid named three of the sons of Somnus: Morpheus, who appears in human guise, Icelos / Phobetor, who appears as beasts, and Phantasos, who appears as inanimate objects.

==Greek tradition==
In the Greek tradition, Hypnos (Sleep) was the brother of Thanatos (Death), and the son of Nyx (Night). According to Hesiod, Sleep, along with Death, live in the underworld, while in the Homeric tradition, although &quot;the land of dreams&quot; was located on the road to the underworld, near the great world-encircling river Oceanus, nearby the city of Cimmerians, Sleep himself lived on the island of Lemnos.

==Virgil==

Following the Greek tradition, Virgil makes Sleep and Death brothers, and locates their dwellings next to each other, near the entrance of the underworld:
::In the first courts and entrances of Hell
::Sorrows and vengeful Cares on couches lie :
::There sad Old Age abides, Diseases pale,
::And Fear, and Hunger, temptress to all crime;
::Want, base and vile, and, two dread shapes to see,
::Bondage and Death : then Sleep, Death&#x27;s next of kin;

Somnus makes a brief appearance in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;. Virgil has Somnus cause Palinurus, the helmsman of Aeneas&#x27;s ship, to fall asleep while steering the ship at night. Somnus, in the guise of Phorbas, a shipmate, appears to Palinurus and offers to take over, so that Palinurus might rest awhile. But Palinurus refused the offer, so Somnus uses a branch, &quot;imbued&quot; with the power of underworld&#x27;s river Styx, to sprinkle Palinurus with water from the river Lethe, the underworld&#x27;s river of forgetfulness. Palinurus then falls asleep, and Somnus pushes him overboard.

==Ovid==

Somnus, and his sons the Somnia appear in Ovid&#x27;s poem &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. Ovid, like Virgil before him, followed Hesiod in making Sleep a denizen of the underworld. However, recalling the location of the &#x27;land of dreams&#x27; in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Ovid also locates the dwelling of Somnus &quot;near the land of the Cimmerians&quot;. Ovid has Somnus live in a cave, describing &quot;the home and chamber of sluggish Sleep&quot; as a place where:
:Phoebus [the Sun] can never enter ... with his rising, noontide, or setting rays. Clouds of vapour breathe forth from the earth, and dusky twilight shadows. There no wakeful, crested cock with his loud crowing summons the dawn; no watch-dog breaks the deep silence with his baying, or goose, more watchful than the dog. There is no sound of wild beast or of cattle, of branches rustling in the breeze, no clamorous tongues of men. There mute silence dwells.
In keeping with this theme of &quot;silence&quot;, Ovid says that Somnus&#x27; house has no doors, &quot;lest some turning hinge should creak&quot;.

Like Virgil, Ovid associates Somnus with the underworld&#x27;s river Lethe, which Ovid has flowing from the bottom of Somnus&#x27; cave, and &quot;whose waves, gently murmuring over the gravelly bed, invite to slumber.&quot; Near the entrance bloom sleep-inducing poppies and other herbs, which Nox (Night) uses to spread sleep over &quot;the darkened lands.&quot; Although Ovid connects Night with Sleep, he makes no mention of Night being Sleep&#x27;s mother as she is in Hesiod.

In the center of the main chamber, Somnus lies &quot;in languorous repose&quot; on a &quot;downy-soft&quot; black couch, surrounded by his innumerable sons, the &quot;empty dream-shapes [&quot;Somnia vana&quot;], mimicking many forms, many as ears of grain in harvest-time, as leaves upon the trees, as sands cast on the shore.&quot; Ovid names three of these form-mimicking &quot;dream shapes&quot;: Morpheus, Icelos/Phobetor, and Phantasos. About Morpheus, Ovid says &quot;no other is more skilled than he in representing the gait, the features, and the speech of men; the clothing also and the accustomed words of each he represents.&quot; Another son called Icelos by the gods, but Phobetor by men, &quot;takes the form of beast or bird or the long serpent&quot;, and a third son named Phantasos &quot;puts on deceptive shapes of earth, rocks, water, trees, all lifeless things&quot;.

In Book 11 of the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, Somnus becomes involved in Ovid&#x27;s telling of the love story of Ceyx and his wife Alcyone. Ceyx has died in a storm at sea. Juno the queen of the gods, sends her messenger Iris to the sleeping Somnus&#x27; cave, to command Somnus to send a dream to Alcyone, in the form of Alcyone&#x27;s husband Ceyx. Arriving at the cave, Iris brushes aside the many sleeping Somnia blocking her way, and her brightly gleaming clothes wake Somnus from his deep slumber. Iris addresses Somnus as &quot;thou rest of all things, Sleep, mildest of the gods, balm of the soul, who puttest care to flight, soothest our bodies worn with hard ministries, and preparest them for toil again!&quot;, then orders Somnus to &quot;Fashion a shape that shall seem true form&quot; to be sent to Alcyone. Iris immediately leaves before she herself is overcome with sleep, and Somnus wakes Morpheus to carry out what Juno has commanded, then goes back to sleep on his couch.

Like other gods associated with sleep, Ovid makes Somnus winged.

<text>Willow Street is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 7,578 at the 2010 census. In the early part of the 20th century, the main thoroughfare in town was lined with willow trees on both sides for the length of the town, hence the community&#x27;s name. As time passed and the town grew, the road was widened and sidewalks were installed, which required the trees be removed. Only a few of the original trees remain to this day. One tall willow tree was situated behind Kendig Square Plaza, but it was downed during a wind storm during late February/early March 2018.

It is the location of the Hans Herr House, the oldest homestead in Lancaster County, and also the Martin Meylin Gunshop, where the long rifle was first made.

PA 272 leads north to the center of Lancaster, the county seat, and south to Wakefield. U.S. Route 222 joins PA 272 in the north part of the CDP (shown as &quot;Mylin Corners&quot; on USGS topographic maps) and leads north into Lancaster but southeast to Quarryville.

<text>In ancient Roman religion and myth, the Parcae (singular, Parca) were the female personifications of destiny who directed the lives (and deaths) of humans and gods. They are often called the Fates in English, and their Greek equivalent were the Moirai. They did not control a person&#x27;s actions except when they are born, when they die, and how much they suffer.

The Parcae recorded the metaphorical thread of life of every mortal and immortal from birth to death. Even the gods feared them, and by some sources Jupiter was also subject to their power.

Nona was supposed to determine a person&#x27;s lifespan on the &quot;dies lustricus&quot;, that is, the day on which the name of the child was chosen, which occurred on the ninth day from birth for a male and the eighth for a female.

The recurrence of the nundinae was also considered a &quot;dies festus&quot; and as such &quot;nefas&quot; by some Roman scholars as Julius Caesar and Cornelius Labeo, because on it the &quot;flaminica dialis&quot; offered the sacrifice of a goat to Jupiter in the Regia.

According to some treatments, the Parcae seem to be more powerful than many, or perhaps even all, of the gods: &quot;The power of the Parcae was great and extensive. Some suppose that they were subjected to none of the gods but Jupiter; while others support that even Jupiter himself was obedient to their commands; and indeed we see the father of the gods, in Homer&#x27;s Iliad, unwilling to see Patroclus perish, yet obliged, by the superior power of the Fates, to abandon him to his destiny.&quot; Similarly: &quot;We have the clearest evidence of the poet for it, that whatever happens to us is under the influence of the Parcae. Jupiter himself can not interfere to save his son Sarpedon.&quot;

== Names and sources ==
The names of the three Parcae are:
* Nona (Greek equivalent &quot;Clotho&quot;), who spun the thread of life from her distaff onto her spindle;
* Decima (Greek &quot;Lachesis&quot;), who measured the thread of life with her rod;
* Morta (Greek &quot;Atropos&quot;), who cut the thread of life and chose the manner of a person&#x27;s death.

The earliest extant documents referencing these deities are three small stelae &quot;(cippi)&quot; found near ancient Lavinium shortly after World War II. They bear the inscription:
&quot;Neuna fata, Neuna dono, Parca Maurtia dono&quot;
The names of two of the three Roman Parcae are recorded (&quot;Neuna&quot; = Nona, &quot;Maurtia&quot; = Morta) and connected to the concept of &quot;fata&quot;.

One of the sources for the Parcae is &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; by Ovid, II 654, V 532, VIII 452, XV 781. Another source is Aeneid by Virgil, in the opening of Book I.

<doc id="84920" wikidata="Q223194" url="?curid=84920" title="Faun">
<text>The faun (, ; , ) is a half-human and half-goat mythological creature appearing in Greek and Roman mythology.

Originally fauns of Roman mythology were ghosts (genii) of rustic places, lesser versions of their chief, the god Faunus. Before their conflation with Greek satyrs, they and Faunus were represented as naked men (e.g. the Barberini Faun). Later fauns became copies of the satyrs of Greek mythology, who themselves were originally shown as part-horse rather than part-goat.

By the Renaissance, fauns were depicted as two-footed creatures with the horns, legs, and tail of a goat and the head, torso, and arms of a human; they are often depicted with pointed ears. These late-form mythological creatures borrowed their look from the satyrs, who in turn borrowed their look from the god Pan of the Greek pantheon. They were symbols of peace and fertility, and their Greek chieftain, Silenus, was a minor deity of Greek mythology.

==Origins==

Romans believed fauns stirred fear in men traveling in lonely, faraway or wild places. They were also capable of guiding men in need, as in the fable of The Satyr and the Traveller, in the title of which Latin authors substituted the word &quot;Faunus&quot;. Fauns and satyrs were originally quite different creatures: whereas late-period fauns are half-man and half-goat, satyrs originally were depicted as stocky, hairy, ugly dwarves or woodwoses, with the ears and tails of horses. Satyrs also were more woman-loving than fauns, and fauns were rather foolish where satyrs tended to be sly.

Ancient Roman mythological belief included a god named Faunus often associated with bewitched woods, and conflated with the Greek god Pan and a goddess named Fauna who were goat people.

==In art==

The &quot;Barberini Faun&quot; (located in the Glyptothek in Munich, Germany) is a Hellenistic marble statue from about 200 BCE, found in the Mausoleum of the Emperor Hadrian (the Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo) and installed at by Cardinal Maffeo Barberini (later Pope Urban VIII). Gian Lorenzo Bernini restored and refinished the statue.

The House of the Faun in Pompei, dating from the 2nd century BCE, was so named because of the dancing faun statue that was the centerpiece of the large garden. The original now resides in the National Museum in Naples and a copy stands in its place.

The French symbolist Stéphane Mallarmé&#x27;s well-known masterpiece &#x27; (published in 1876) describes the sensual experiences of a faun who has just woken up from his afternoon sleep and discusses his encounters with several nymphs during the morning in a dreamlike monologue. The composer Claude Debussy based his symphonic poem &#x27; (1894) on the poem, which also served as the scenario for a ballet entitled &quot;&quot; (or &quot;Afternoon of a Faun&quot;) choreographed to Debussy&#x27;s score in 1912 by Vaslav Nijinsky.

==In fiction==

* Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s (1860) romance &quot;The Marble Faun&quot; is set in Italy, and was said to have been inspired by his viewing the Faun of Praxiteles in the Capitoline Museum.
* In H.G. Wells&#x27; (1895) &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, in the year 802,701CE, while exploring the far future, the Time Traveller sees &quot;a statuea faun, or some such figure, &quot;minus&quot; the head.&quot;
* Mr. Tumnus, in C. S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; (1949), is a faun. Lewis said that the famous &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; story all came to him from a single picture he had in his head of a faun carrying an umbrella and parcels through a snowy wood. In the film series, fauns are distinct from satyrs, which are more goat-like in form.
* In &quot;Lolita&quot;, the protagonist is attracted to pubescent girls whom he dubs &quot;nymphets&quot;; &quot;faunlets&quot; are the male equivalent.
* In the 1981 film &quot;My Dinner with Andre&quot;, it is related how fauns befriend and take a mathematician to meet Pan.
* In Guillermo del Toro&#x27;s 2006 film &quot;&quot; (&quot;Pan&#x27;s Labyrinth&quot;), a faun guides the film&#x27;s protagonist, Ofelia, to a series of tasks, which lead her to a wondrous netherworld.
* In Rick Riordan&#x27;s &quot;The Son of Neptune&quot; (2011), the character Don is a faun. In the book, several fauns appear, begging for money. Due to his memory of the Greek satyrs, Percy Jackson feels like there should be more to fauns. Also, in the prequel to &quot;The Son of Neptune&quot;, &quot;The Lost Hero&quot;, Jason Grace calls Gleeson Hedge a faun upon learning that he is a satyr. In the third instalment in the series, &quot;The Mark of Athena&quot;, Frank Zhang calls Hedge a faun.
* In &quot;The Goddess Within&quot;, a visionary fiction novel written by Iva Kenaz, the main heroine falls in love with a faun.
* In the &quot;Spyro&quot; video game series, Elora is a faun from Avalar, who helps Spyro the dragon navigate the world around him.
* In &quot;Carnival Row&quot;, fauns or &#x27;pucks&#x27; are one of the mythical creatures that are part of the series.

<text>Fama is a Regional Mexican/Tejano band originally from Houston, Texas. Formed in 1989, at the height of their popularity, the band consisted of lead vocalist Javier Galvan, bassist Oscar Galvin, Saxophonist Edgar Galvan, Trumpet Eddie Gonzalez, Accordion/Keyboardist Israel Dominguez, Guitarist John Barraza, Keyboardist Rogelio Zavala Jr, Guitarist Steve Ochoa, Drummer Eddie Dominguez (1990–94), Drummer Ruben Enriquez (1994–96), and Drummer Joel Garza (1996–98)

==Biography==
Fama was formed in 1989 by brothers Javier, Oscar, and Edgar Galvan, and friend of the brothers Eddie Gonzalez, the band gained prominence in the mid-1990s with a string of hit albums. They were given the nickname &quot;The Golden Boys&quot; by Tejano music DJs.

Fama signed with Discos CBS International in 1989 which became Sony Discos in 1992. Javier Galvan was then signed with Joey Records and is now under his own label (Famuz).
Javier was nominated for &quot;Song of the Year&quot; in the BMI Awards in 1994.
Fama was awarded the &quot;Premio Lo Nuestro&quot; for &quot;Revelacion Del Año&quot; in 1994.
In 2007 Javier won &quot;Mejor Vocalista Masculino&quot; and Fama won &quot;Mejor Grupo Tejano&quot; in the &quot;Premios de la Musica Latina&quot;

Fama would perform on The Johnny Canales Show in 1993

Fama has earned recognition as one of the most dominating bands in the Latin music industry across the nation. A string of career hit singles came their way in the mid &#x27;90s&#x27; when &quot;Lagrimas De Alegria&quot;, &quot;Quiero Volverte A Ver&quot;, &quot;Querer Tu Amor&quot;, &quot;Te Voy A Enseñar&quot;, &quot;Ojitos Color Cafe&quot;, &quot;Amor Perdoname&quot;, &quot;Boulevard De Sueños&quot; and &quot;Llorando&quot; dominated the airwaves as they spent numerous weeks atop Latin Billboard airplay charts, earning numerous awards and nominations from BMI, Premios Lo Nuestro, and Univision&#x27;s Premios A La Musica Latina. In the process, Fama also appeared on numerous international Latin television programs such as: Despierta America, El Gordo y La Flaca, Escadalo TV, Padrisimo,
Control, and Sabado Gigante. Statistically speaking, Fama have scaled unbelievable heights, carving a permanent place in the music scene. Fama are one of the few artists to have shattered international barriers. With 18 recorded albums, of which four were certified gold, three platinum, and one double platinum, it is undeniably clear of how or why FAMA&#x27;s fans by the thousands have responded positively and passionately. Fama&#x27;s last album entitled &quot;Con La Misma Pasión&quot; solidifies their commitment to their music, their style, and their fans. As that CD proves, they are stronger than ever. This commitment to their fans, without question, displays another measurement of the talent and versatility that will genuinely take Fama to new heights of achievement in their musical career. Fama continues its saga as a band whose music has truly stood the test of time. Fama&#x27;s sound represents the past, present and future of their genre.

In August 2009 Javier Galvan retired from Fama and signed over the Fama name to John Barraza and Eddie Dominguez. The band continues to tour nationally.

May 2010, Fama signed to the record label AMMX Records.

<doc id="84924" wikidata="Q1348622" url="?curid=84924" title="Soviet submarine K-77">
<text>K-77 was a &quot;Project 651&quot; (NATO reporting name: ) diesel–electric submarine built for the Soviet Navy during the 1960s. Commissioned in 1965, the boat was armed with long-range cruise missiles to carry out its mission of destroying American aircraft carriers and bases. The missiles could be fitted with either conventional or nuclear warheads.

&quot;K-77&quot; was built later in the Juliett class, so her hull was conventional steel and her battery was of the conventional lead-acid type, rather than the austenitic steel and silver-zinc batteries used in the first Julietts. &quot;K-77&quot; was also used as the set for the motion picture &quot;K-19: The Widowmaker&quot;, starring Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson.

The boat flooded and sank during a storm in 2007. She was refloated a year later and subsequently scrapped.

==Background and description==
In the late 1950s, the Soviet Navy was tasked to neutralize American bases and aircraft carriers. It began construction of a large number of expensive nuclear-powered (s) to accomplish this, but could not build enough nuclear reactors to equip them in a timely manner. Even though the Juliett class was inferior to the Echos, it was ordered into production because it did not require resources needed for the nuclear boats.

The Juliett-class boats are a double-hulled design that displaces on the surface and submerged. The boats have an overall length of , a beam of and a draft (ship) of . The Julietts have a test depth of and a design depth of . The prominent blast deflectors cut out of the outer hull behind the missile launchers make the submarines very noisy at high speed. Their crew numbered 78 men.

===Propulsion and performance===
The Juliett class is powered by a diesel-electric system that consists of two 1D43 diesel engines and a pair of MG-141 electric motors for cruising on the surface. Two additional electric motors are intended for slow speeds underwater and are powered by four banks of lead-acid battery cells that are recharged by a 1DL42 diesel generator. The boats are fitted with a retractable snorkel to allow the diesel engines to operate while underwater.

On the surface, the submarines have a maximum speed of . Using their diesel-electric system while snorkeling gives the Julietts a range of at . Using just the electric motors underwater, they have a maximum range of at . Their best submerged speed on electric motors is , although it reduces their range to . They could carry enough supplies for 90 days of operation.

===Armament===
To carry out the Julietts&#x27; mission of destroying American carrier battle groups and bases, they were fitted with two pairs of missile launchers, one each fore and aft of the sail. The launchers were used by the surface-launched SS-N-3 Shaddock family of long-range, turbojet-powered, cruise missiles. The P-5D version was codenamed SS-N-3c by NATO and was a dedicated land-attack missile that could be equipped with either a high-explosive or nuclear warhead; it was withdrawn from service in 1965–1966. The P-6 (SS-N-3a) variant was a radar-guided anti-ship missile that could also be fitted with high-explosive and nuclear warheads.
The more traditional armament of the Julietts consisted of six torpedo tubes mounted in the bow and four torpedo tubes in the stern. Due to space limitations, no reloads were provided for the bow tubes, but each stern tube had two reloads for a total of twelve.

===Fire control and sensors===

The submarines relied upon aircraft for their long-range anti-ship targeting which they received via the Uspekh-U datalink system. Their own Argument missile-guidance radar (NATO reporting name: Front Door) controlled the P-6 missiles until they were out of range via a datalink codenamed Front Piece. The missiles&#x27; onboard radar would detect the targets and transmit an image back to the submarine via video datalink so the crew could select which target to attack, after which the missile relied upon its own radar for terminal guidance. The Argument radar has a massive antenna that was stowed at the front of the sail and rotated 180° for use. The Front Piece antenna was mounted on top of the Argument antenna.

The boats are fitted with Artika-M (MG-200) and Herkules (MG-15) sonars, Feniks-M (MG-10) and MG-13 hydrophones and an Albatros RLK-50 search radar (NATO reporting name: Snoop Tray). They are also equipped with a Nakat-M Electronic warfare support measures system.

== Construction and career ==
&quot;K-77&quot; was laid down at the Krasnoye Sormovo Factory No. 112 shipyard in Gorky on 31 January 1963. She was launched on 11 March 1965 and commissioned on 31 October into the Northern Fleet. The details of &quot;K-77&quot;″s career remain largely unknown although she made at least two patrols in the Mediterranean Sea. During her second deployment there, the boat trailed the United States Navy carriers of the Sixth Fleet between May and November 1974. Two years later K-77 was deployed in the Caribbean Sea near the Puerto Rico. In 1977, &quot;K-77&quot; (the K standing for () was redesignated &quot;Б-77&quot; (the Б standing for ). In 1987, &quot;K-77&quot; was withdrawn from the blue-water Northern Fleet and transferred to the 16th Submarine Division of the Baltic Fleet. Four years later, they were relegated to the 58th Submarine Brigade to finish out their service lives. &quot;K-77&quot; was decommissioned sometime after 1991, and by the end of 1994, all Julietts had been retired.

=== Post-decommissioning ===

==== Finland ====
At the end of the Cold War, Finnish businessman Jari Komulainen, who was married to the daughter of President of Finland Mauno Koivisto, used his influence as Finland&#x27;s &quot;first son-in-law&quot; to convince the Russian government to lease him a Project 641 &quot;Foxtrot&quot;-class submarine, probably the ex-. Komulainen opened it to the public in Helsinki in the spring of 1993 as a tourist attraction. He then purchased two Juliett-class submarines, one K-77 replacing the Foxtrot in 1994, becoming a bar and restaurant as well as a tourist attraction. Komulainen believed that his restaurant had been &quot;K-81&quot;, based on a metal plate discovered inside the boat. However, it later transpired that that plate and others bearing different numbers were provided for the crew to display on the submarine&#x27;s sail during surface running to confuse NATO reconnaissance aircraft. Komulainen also held a beauty pageant &quot;Miss Submarine&quot; at the submarine. Model Anitra Ahtola, who won the competition, later became his third wife.

As a restaurant, &quot;K-77&quot; was modestly successful, but was not lucrative enough to satisfy Komulainen. In 1998, he leased his submarine to a Canadian promoter, who towed it to Tampa Bay, Florida. However, the intended mooring location in the harbor was too shallow and the investors were forced to move the proposed tourist attraction to a more remote site. Soon, the promoter filed for bankruptcy, and &quot;K-77&quot; reverted to Komulainen. He did not want to repeat the nerve-wracking trans-Atlantic tow, and instead tried at least twice to auction the submarine on eBay — auctions #222791130, ending on 20 December 1999, and #270148521, ending on 7 March 2000. In each case, bidding was to start at US$1 million. No bids were received.

==== &quot;Widowmaker&quot; ====
The eBay auction, however, caught the attention of Intermedia Film Equities Ltd., who chartered &quot;K-77&quot; for US$200,000 and towed her to Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 2000 to become the set for the motion picture &quot;K-19: The Widowmaker&quot;, starring Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson. The boat was modified with fiberglass to make it resemble a submarine.

==== Museum ====
The film wrapped up in 2002, when the submarine was purchased by the USS &quot;Saratoga&quot; Museum Foundation, towed to Collier Point Park in Providence, Rhode Island, and opened to the public in August 2002. &quot;K-77&quot; offered public tours and a comprehensive educational program in accordance with New Standards and attuned to the advancement requirements of both Boy Scout and Girl Scout programs.

When the &quot;Saratoga&quot; Museum Foundation took possession of the submarine, it was described as &quot;K-81&quot; in the initial press releases from the &quot;Saratoga&quot; Museum Foundation. The foundation spent months refurbishing the interior, which included removing several bulkheads, moving large pieces of equipment, and going deep into the bilges. During this process, documents were found which provided incontrovertible proof that the submarine was &quot;K-77&quot; and not &quot;K-81&quot; as earlier thought. The records confirming this information include maintenance reports, equipment exchanges, radio messages, duty rosters, log entries, and torpedo firing exercises, which all identify the submarine as &quot;K-77&quot;.

==== Sinking ====

The submarine sank on 18 April 2007 after a storm, and plans were made to raise it off the river bottom. The Museum&#x27;s theory on why the submarine sank is that a modified hatch was not properly watertight. Recovery efforts by U.S. Navy and Army divers began in June 2008 as part of a project to train military divers through real-world, community-based projects.

On 2 June 2008, divers from Mobile Diving and Salvage Unit Two in Norfolk, Virginia arrived and began preparations to raise the submarine. On 25 July 2008, she was brought to the surface by US Navy and Army divers. The work of pumping out water was completed in August 2008. The sub was badly deteriorated and in need of substantial repair.

On 11 August 2009, RI Recycled Metals LLC towed the sub to a facility from the museum site so that it could be scrapped.

A portion of the vessel remained in the river and in 2017, a judge ordered that the remnants be removed.

A section of the submarine was destroyed in a fire in March 2021 while in the process of being dismantled at a Providence scrapyard.

<text>In Sabine and ancient Roman religion and myth, Luna is the divine embodiment of the Moon (Latin &quot;Lūna&quot; ). She is often presented as the female complement of the Sun, Sol, conceived of as a god. Luna is also sometimes represented as an aspect of the Roman triple goddess (&quot;diva triformis&quot;), along with Diana and either Proserpina or Hecate. &quot;Luna&quot; is not always a distinct goddess, but sometimes rather an epithet that specializes a goddess, since both Diana and Juno are identified as moon goddesses.

In Roman art, Luna attributes are the crescent moon plus the two-yoke chariot (&quot;biga&quot;). In the &quot;Carmen Saeculare&quot;, performed in 17 BC, Horace invokes her as the &quot;two-horned queen of the stars&quot; (&quot;siderum regina bicornis&quot;), bidding her to listen to the girls singing as Apollo listens to the boys.

Varro categorized Luna and Sol among the visible gods, as distinguished from invisible gods such as Neptune, and deified mortals such as Hercules. She was one of the deities Macrobius proposed as the secret tutelary of Rome. In Imperial cult, Sol and Luna can represent the extent of Roman rule over the world, with the aim of guaranteeing peace.

Luna&#x27;s Greek counterpart was Selene. In Roman art and literature, myths of Selene are adapted under the name of Luna. The myth of Endymion, for instance, was a popular subject for Roman wall painting.

==Cult and temples==
Varro lists Luna among twelve deities who are vital to agriculture, as does Vergil in a different list of twelve, in which he refers to Luna and Sol as &quot;clarissima mundi lumina&quot;, the world&#x27;s clearest sources of light. Varro also lists Luna among twenty principal gods of Rome (&quot;di selecti&quot;). In this list, Luna is distinguished from both Diana and Juno, who also appear on it.

The Romans dated the cultivation of Luna as a goddess at Rome to the semi-legendary days of the kings. Titus Tatius was supposed to have imported the cult of Luna to Rome from the Sabines, but Servius Tullius was credited with the creation of the Temple of Luna on the Aventine Hill, just below a temple of Diana. The anniversary of the temple founding (&quot;dies natalis&quot;) was celebrated annually on March 31. It first appears in Roman literature in the story of how in 182 BC a windstorm of exceptional power blew off its doors, which crashed into the Temple of Ceres below it on the slope. In 84 BC, it was struck by lightning, the same day the popularis leader Cinna was murdered by his troops. The Aventine temple may have been destroyed by the Great Fire of Rome during the reign of Nero.

As Noctiluna (&quot;Night-Shiner&quot;) Luna had a temple on the Palatine Hill, which Varro described as shining or glowing by night. Nothing else is known about the temple, and it is unclear what Varro meant.

==Juno as Moon goddess==
The Kalends of every month, when according to the lunar calendar the new moon occurred, was sacred to Juno, as all Ides were to Jupiter. On the Nones, she was honored as Juno Covella, Juno of the crescent moon. Both Juno and Diana were invoked as childbirth goddesses with the epithet &quot;Lucina&quot;.

==Chariot of the Moon==

Luna is often depicted driving a two-yoke chariot called a &quot;biga&quot;, drawn by horses or oxen. In Roman art, the charioteer Luna is regularly paired with the Sun driving a four-horse chariot (&quot;quadriga&quot;).

Isidore of Seville explains that the &quot;quadriga&quot; represents the sun&#x27;s course through the four seasons, while the &quot;biga&quot; represents the Moon, &quot;because it travels on a twin course with the sun, or because it is visible both by day and by night—for they yoke together one black horse and one white.&quot;

Luna in her &quot;biga&quot; was an element of Mithraic iconography, usually in the context of the tauroctony. In the mithraeum of S. Maria Capua Vetere, a wall painting that uniquely focuses on Luna alone shows one of the horses of the team as light in color, with the other a dark brown.

A &quot;biga&quot; of oxen was also driven by Hecate, the chthonic aspect of the triple goddess in complement with the &quot;horned&quot; or crescent-crowned Diana and Luna. The three-form Hecate (&quot;trimorphos&quot;) was identified by Servius with Luna, Diana, and Proserpina. According to the Archaic Greek poet Hesiod, Hecate originally had power over the heavens, land, and sea, not as in the later tradition Heaven, Earth, and underworld.

<doc id="84927" wikidata="Q548445" url="?curid=84927" title="Silvanus (mythology)">
<text>Silvanus (; meaning &quot;of the woods&quot; in Latin) was a Roman tutelary deity of woods and uncultivated lands. As protector of the forest (&quot;sylvestris deus&quot;), he especially presided over plantations and delighted in trees growing wild. He is also described as a god watching over the fields and husbandmen, protecting in particular the boundaries of fields. The similarly named Etruscan deity Selvans may be a borrowing of Silvanus, or not even related in origin.

Silvanus is described as the divinity protecting the flocks of cattle, warding off wolves, and promoting their fertility. Dolabella, a rural engineer of whom only a few pages are known, states that Silvanus was the first to set up stones to mark the limits of fields, and that every estate had three &quot;Silvani:&quot;
* a &quot;Silvanus domesticus&quot; (in inscriptions called &quot;Silvanus Larum&quot; and &quot;Silvanus sanctus sacer Larum&quot;)
* a &quot;Silvanus agrestis&quot; (also called &quot;salutaris&quot;, literally &quot;of the fields&quot; or &quot;saviour&quot;), who was worshipped by shepherds, and
* a &quot;Silvanus orientalis&quot;, literally &quot;of the east&quot;, that is, the god presiding over the point at which an estate begins.
Hence &quot;Silvani&quot; were often referred to in the plural.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Silvānus&quot; () is a derivation from Latin &quot;silva&quot; (&#x27;forest, wood&#x27;). It is cognate with the Latin words &quot;silvester&quot; (&#x27;wild, not cultivated&#x27;), &quot;silvicola&quot; (&#x27;inhabiting woodlands&#x27;) or &quot;silvaticus&quot; (&#x27;of woodlands or scrub&#x27;). The etymology of &quot;silva&quot; is unclear.

==Attributes and associations==

Like other gods of woods and flocks, Silvanus is described as fond of music; the syrinx was sacred to him, and he is mentioned along with the Pans and Nymphs. Later speculators even identified Silvanus with Pan, Faunus, Inuus and Aegipan. He must have been associated with the Italian Mars, for Cato refers to him consistently as &quot;Mars Silvanus&quot;. These references to Silvanus as an aspect of Mars combined with his association with forests and glades, give context to the worship of Silvanus as the giver of the art (techne) of forest warfare. In particular the initiation rituals of the evocati appear to have referenced Silvanus as a protective god of raiding for women and cattle, perhaps preserving elements of earlier Etruscan worship. 

In the provinces outside of Italy, Silvanus was identified with numerous native gods:
:*Sucellos, Poeninus, Sinquas and Tettus in Gaul and Germany.
:*Callirius, Cocidius and Vinotonus in Britain. A Romano-Celtic Temple containing several plaques dedicated to &quot;Silvanus Callirius&quot; has been found at Camulodunum (modern Colchester).
:*Calaedicus in Spain.
:*The Mogiae in Pannonia.
:*Selvans in Etruria (though the validity of this identification has been contested).
:*Silenus, a Greek God, merged with Silvanus in Latin Literature.
:*Pan (god of forests, pastures, and shepherds), in Greco-Roman mythology.
:*Aristaeus, a god/patron of shepherds, harvest and other rural arts.

The Slavic god Porewit has similarities with Silvanus.

Xavier Delamarre suggests the epithet &quot;Callirius&quot; may be related to Breton theonym &quot;Riocalat(is)&quot; (attested in Cumberland Quarries), and both mean &quot;(God) With Wild Horses&quot;.

==Worship==
The sacrifices offered to Silvanus consisted of grapes, ears of grain, milk, meat, wine and pigs. In Cato&#x27;s &quot;De Agricultura&quot; an offering to &quot;Mars Silvanus&quot; is described, to ensure the health of cattle; it is stated there that his connection with agriculture referred to only the labour performed by men, and that females were excluded from his worship. (Compare Bona Dea for a Roman deity from whose worship men were excluded.) Virgil relates that in the very earliest times the Tyrrhenian Pelasgians had dedicated a grove and a festival to Silvanus, a symbol for the wilderness of the god.

==In literature==
In works of Latin poetry and art, Silvanus always appears as an old man, but as cheerful and in love with Pomona. Virgil represents him as carrying the trunk of a cypress (), about which the following myth is told. Silvanus – or Apollo according to other versions – was in love with Cyparissus, and once by accident killed a pet hind belonging to Cyparissus. The latter died of grief, and was metamorphosed into a cypress.

In Edmund Spenser&#x27;s epic poem &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; (1590–96), Silvanus appears in Canto VI of Book I. His &#x27;wyld woodgods&#x27; (Stanza 9) save the lost and frightened Lady Una from being molested by &quot;Sans loy&quot; and take her to him. They treat her as a Queen because of her great beauty. Spenser writes in Stanza 14:

:::So towards old &quot;Syluanus&quot; they did her bring;
:::Who with the noyse awaked, commeth out,
:::To weet the cause, his weake steps gouerning,
:::And aged limbs on Cypresse stadle stout,
:::And with an yvie twyne his wast is girt gud about.

<text>Witness is a 1985 American neo-noir crime thriller film directed by Peter Weir. Starring Harrison Ford, its plot focuses on a police detective protecting an Amish woman and her son, who becomes a target after he witnesses a brutal murder in a Philadelphia railway station.

Filmed in 1984, &quot;Witness&quot; was released theatrically by Paramount Pictures in February 1985. The film went on to become a sleeper hit, grossing over $116 million worldwide. At the 58th Academy Awards, it earned eight nominations, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Ford, winning Best Original Screenplay and Best Film Editing. It was also nominated for seven BAFTA Awards, winning one for Maurice Jarre&#x27;s score, and six Golden Globe Awards. William Kelley and Earl W. Wallace won the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay and the 1986 Edgar Award for Best Motion Picture Screenplay presented by the Mystery Writers of America.

==Plot==
An Amish community outside Lancaster, Pennsylvania, attends the funeral of Jacob Lapp, leaving behind his wife, Rachel, and eight-year-old son, Samuel. Rachel and Samuel travel by train to visit Rachel&#x27;s sister, which takes them into Philadelphia. While at the 30th Street Station waiting for a connecting train, Samuel goes into the men&#x27;s room and witnesses the murder of undercover police officer Detective Ian Zenovich.

Detective Captain John Book and his partner, Sergeant Elton Carter, are assigned to the case. They question Samuel, who is unable to identify the perpetrator from mugshots or a lineup. Samuel then sees a newspaper clipping in a trophy case of narcotics officer Lieutenant James McFee and points him out to Book as the murderer.

Book investigates McFee and discovers that he was previously responsible for a seizure of expensive chemicals used to make black-market amphetamine, after which the chemicals disappeared. Book surmises that McFee sold the chemicals back to drug dealers, and Zenovich was investigating. Book expresses his suspicions to Chief of Police Paul Schaeffer, who advises Book to keep the case secret so that they can determine how to proceed. Book is later ambushed in his apartment parking garage by McFee, who shoots and wounds him before fleeing. Since only Schaeffer knew of Book&#x27;s suspicions, Book realizes that Schaeffer is corrupt and tipped off McFee.

Knowing that Samuel and Rachel are now in danger, Book orders Carter to hide their police files. He then drives them back to their farm. While beginning his drive back to Philadelphia, he passes out from his wounds and crashes into their birdhouse. Rachel insists that he be taken to a hospital, but Book refuses and states that going there would allow him and, by extension, them to be found. Rachel&#x27;s father-in-law, Eli, reluctantly agrees to shelter Book.

Book slowly recovers in their care and begins to blend into the Amish community and lifestyle. He and Rachel develop feelings for each other, which becomes a source of friction for Daniel Hochleitner (a neighbor who had hoped to court Rachel after her husband&#x27;s death). Book&#x27;s relationship with the Amish community deepens as they learn that he is skilled at carpentry and seems like a decent, hard-working man. He is invited to participate in a barn raising for a newly-married couple, gaining Hochleitner&#x27;s respect. However, the attraction between Book and Rachel is evident and causes gossip in the tight-knit community.

Meanwhile, Schaeffer searches for Book by contacting authorities in the Amish area. However, since Amish communities have no modern means of communication and little contact with the outside world, he hits repeated dead ends.

When Book goes into town with Eli to use a payphone to call his precinct, he learns that Carter was killed in the line of duty. Realizing that Schaeffer was behind it, Book calls him at his home (where the call cannot be traced), chastises him for being corrupt and threatens to kill him. As they leave town, a group of locals harass the Amish. Book retaliates, breaking with the Amish tradition of non-violence. The assault is reported to the local police, and word eventually gets back to Schaeffer.

Upset with Book over the assault, Eli orders him to leave. Rachel approaches Book in a field, where they passionately embrace, finally acting on their feelings. Soon after, Schaeffer, McFee and another corrupt cop, Sergeant Leon &quot;Fergie&quot; Ferguson, arrive at the Lapp farm. They take Rachel and Eli hostage. Eli manages to alert Book, and Book tells Samuel to hide at Hochleitner&#x27;s farm. Book tricks Fergie into the corn silo and suffocates him under tons of corn. He then uses Fergie&#x27;s shotgun to kill McFee. Schaeffer holds Rachel and Eli at gunpoint, but Samuel secretly comes back to ring the Lapp farm&#x27;s bell. Book confronts Schaeffer, who threatens to kill Rachel, but the bell has alerted and summoned all of the neighbors. With so many witnesses present, Schaeffer surrenders and is later arrested.

With Rachel and Samuel no longer in danger, Book departs for Philadelphia, bidding farewell. Before he drives off, Eli wishes John well by saying, &quot;You be careful out there among them English.”

Per the film&#x27;s end credits: 
==Themes==
In his book &quot;The Amish in the American Imagination&quot; (2001), scholar David Weaver-Zercher notes that &quot;Witness&quot; is primarily concerned with the intersection of contrasting cultures, a recurring theme in several of Weir&#x27;s films, including &quot;The Last Wave&quot; (1977) and &quot;The Year of Living Dangerously&quot; (1982). Weaver-Zercher notes that the conflict between Amish and non-Amish as depicted in &quot;Witness&quot; &quot;reflect[s] well on the Amish ways&quot; and also serves as a redemption story for Captain Book, who regains a new sense of humanity during his displacement in the Amish community.

==Production==
===Development===
Producer Edward S. Feldman, who was in a &quot;first-look&quot; development deal with 20th Century Fox at the time, first received the screenplay for &quot;Witness&quot; in 1983. Originally titled &quot;Called Home&quot;, which is the Amish term for death, it ran for 182 pages, the equivalent of three hours of screen time. The script, which had been circulating in Hollywood for several years, began with an idea by novelist Pamela Wallace for a novel about an Amish woman who witnesses a murder in Los Angeles. Earl W. Wallace, who wrote for the television Western &quot;How the West was Won&quot; recalled an episode with a similar plot and contacted its writer, William Kelley. Kelley had reworked the plot for the show from a script he had written for a 1972 episode of &quot;Gunsmoke.&quot; Earl Wallace and Kelley wrote the original screenplay together.

Feldman liked the concept, but felt too much of the script was devoted to Amish traditions, diluting the thriller aspects of the story. He offered Kelley and Wallace $25,000 for a one-year option and one rewrite, and an additional $225,000 if the film actually were made. They submitted the revised screenplay in less than six weeks, and Feldman delivered it to Fox. Joe Wizan, the studio&#x27;s head of production, rejected it with the statement that Fox did not make &quot;rural movies&quot;.

Feldman sent the screenplay to Harrison Ford&#x27;s agent Phil Gersh, who contacted the producer four days later and advised him his client was willing to commit to the film. Certain the attachment of a major star would change Wizan&#x27;s mind, Feldman approached him once again, but Wizan insisted that as much as the studio liked Ford, they still were not interested in making a &quot;rural movie.&quot;

Feldman sent the screenplay to numerous studios, and was rejected by all of them, until Paramount Pictures finally expressed interest. Feldman&#x27;s first choice of director was Peter Weir, but he was involved in preproduction work for &quot;The Mosquito Coast&quot; and passed on the project. John Badham dismissed it as &quot;just another cop movie&quot;, and others Feldman approached either were committed to other projects or had no interest. Then, as financial backing for &quot;The Mosquito Coast&quot; fell through, Weir became free to direct &quot;Witness&quot;, which was his first American film. Starting the film immediately was imperative, because a Directors Guild of America (DGA) strike was looming. David Cronenberg was offered the role of director, but declined as he &quot;could never be a fan of the Amish&quot;.

===Casting===

Lynne Littman had originally been in talks to direct the film, and though she ultimately did not, she recommended Lukas Haas for the part of Samuel, because she had recently worked with him on her film &quot;Testament&quot;. The role of Rachel was the most difficult to cast, and after Weir grew frustrated with the auditions he had seen, he asked the casting director to look for actors in Italy, because he thought they would be more &quot;womanly&quot;. As they were reviewing audition tapes from Italy, Kelly McGillis came to audition, and the moment she put on the bonnet and spoke a few lines, Weir knew she was the one. The casting director recommended her old friend Alexander Godunov, who had never acted before, but she thought his personality would be right, and Weir agreed.

Viggo Mortensen was cast because Weir thought he had the right face for the part of an Amish man. Mortensen had just started his acting career, so this was his first film acting role, and he had to turn down another role as a soldier in Shakespeare in the Park&#x27;s production of&quot; Henry V&quot;. He credited that decision and the very positive experience on the film as the start of his film career.

===Pre-production===
During the weeks before filming, Ford spent time with the homicide department of the Philadelphia Police Department, researching the important details of working as a homicide detective. McGillis did research by moving in with an Amish widow and her seven children, learning how to milk cows and practicing their Pennsylvania German dialect.

Weir and cinematographer John Seale went on a trip to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, which was running an exhibition of 17th-century Dutch Masters. Weir drew attention to the paintings of Johannes Vermeer, which were used as inspiration for the lighting and composition of the film, especially in the scenes where John Book is recovering from a gunshot wound in Rachel&#x27;s house.

===Filming===
Principal photography took place between April 27, 1984 and June 29, 1984. The film was shot on location in Philadelphia and the city and towns of Intercourse, Lancaster, Strasburg, and Parkesburg. Local Amish were willing to work as carpenters and electricians, but declined to appear on film, so many of the extras were actually Mennonites. Halfway through filming, the title was changed from &quot;Called Home&quot; to &quot;Witness&quot; at the behest of Paramount&#x27;s marketing department, which felt the original title posed too much of a promotional challenge. Principal photography was completed three days before the scheduled DGA strike, which ultimately failed to materialize.

During the set-up and rehearsal of each scene, as well as during dailies, Weir would play music to set the mood, with the idea that it prevented the actors from thinking too much and let them listen to their other instincts. The barn-raising scene was only a short paragraph in the script, but Weir thought it was important to highlight that aspect of Amish community life. They shot the scene in a day and did, in fact, build a barn, albeit with the aid of cranes off-camera. To film the scene in the corn silo, corn was actually dropped onto the actor, while a scuba diving regulator with a compressed air tank was hidden on the floor so the actor would be able to breathe.

Originally, the script ended with a scene of Book and Rachel each explaining their feelings for each other to the audience, but Weir felt the scene was unnecessary and decided not to shoot it. The studio executives were concerned that the audience would not understand the conclusion, and tried to convince him otherwise, but Weir insisted that the characters&#x27; emotions could be expressed only with visuals.

==Release==
&quot;Witness&quot; had its world premiere at the Fulton Opera House in Lancaster, Pennsylvania in on February 7, 1985. The film was screened out of competition at the 1985 Cannes Film Festival.

===Box office===
The film opened theatrically in 876 theaters in the United States on February 8, 1985, and grossed $4,539,990 in its opening weekend, ranking number two behind &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot;. The film went on to become a sleeper hit, topping the charts in its fifth week of release. It eventually earned a total of $68,706,993 in North America. Internationally, it grossed $47.4 million for a worldwide total of $116.1 million.

===Home media===
Paramount Home Entertainment released Witness on VHS, with a DVD in initially in 1999 and then in 2005, along with a Blu-ray Disc in 2015.
British boutique label Arrow Films released the film in the United States on 4K Ultra HD disc and remastered Blu-ray on October 31, 2023.

==Reception==

On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Witness&quot; holds an approval rating of 94% based on 47 reviews, with an average rating of 8.5/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus states: &quot;A wonderfully entertaining thriller within an unusual setting, with Harrison Ford delivering a surprisingly emotive and sympathetic performance.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 76 out of 100 based on 14 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; rated the film four out of four stars, calling it: Ebert also praised Ford&#x27;s work and believed he had &quot;never given a better performance in a movie.&quot;

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was much more negative, saying of the film:

&quot;Variety&quot; said the film was &quot;at times a gentle, affecting story of star-crossed lovers limited within the fascinating Amish community. Too often, however, this fragile romance is crushed by a thoroughly absurd shoot-&#x27;em-up, like ketchup poured over a delicate Pennsylvania Dutch dinner.&quot;

&quot;Time Out New York&quot; observed, &quot;Powerful, assured, full of beautiful imagery and thankfully devoid of easy moralizing, it also offers a performance of surprising skill and sensitivity from Ford.&quot;

&quot;Halliwell&#x27;s Film Guide&quot; chose &quot;Witness&quot; as one of only two films from 1985 to receive a four-star review, describing it as &quot;one of those lucky movies which works out well on all counts and shows that there are still craftsmen lurking in Hollywood.&quot;

&quot;Radio Times&quot; called the film &quot;partly a love story and partly a thriller, but mainly a study of cultural collision – it&#x27;s as if the world of &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; had suddenly stumbled into a canvas by Brueghel.&quot; It added, &quot;[I]t&#x27;s Weir&#x27;s delicacy of touch that impresses the most. He ably juggles the various elements of the story and makes the violence seem even more shocking when it&#x27;s played out on the fields of Amish denial.&quot;

===Accolades ===
===Controversy===
Leading up to and following its release, &quot;Witness&quot; was met with controversy from the Amish communities where it was filmed, and was subject to debate from editors, scholars, and other parties regarding its depiction of the Amish. Some accused the film of exploiting the Amish community for commercial purposes, while others felt that the depiction of Amish characters in an R-rated film was insensitive to the Amish&#x27;s beliefs.

A statement released by a law firm associated with the Amish claimed that their portrayal in the movie was not accurate. The National Committee for Amish Religious Freedom called for a boycott of the movie soon after its release, citing fears that these communities were being &quot;overrun by tourists&quot; as a result of the popularity of the movie, and worried that &quot;the crowding, souvenir-hunting, photographing and trespassing on Amish farmsteads will increase.&quot; After the movie was completed, Pennsylvania governor Dick Thornburgh agreed not to promote Amish communities as future film sites. A similar concern was voiced within the movie itself, where Rachel tells a recovering Book that tourists often consider her fellow Amish something to stare at, with some even being so rude as to trespass on their private property.

==Legacy==
Negotiation expert William Ury summarised the film&#x27;s climactic scene in a chapter titled &quot;The Witness&quot; in his 1999 book &quot;Getting to Peace&quot; (later republished with the alternative title &quot;The Third Side: Why We Fight and How We Can Stop&quot;) and used the scene as a symbol of the power of ordinary citizens to resolve conflicts and stop violence.

Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited &quot;Witness&quot; as one of his favorite films of all time.

<text>Kyrgyz is a Turkic language of the Kipchak branch spoken in Central Asia. Kyrgyz is the official language of Kyrgyzstan and a significant minority language in the Kizilsu Kyrgyz Autonomous Prefecture in Xinjiang, China and in the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region of Tajikistan. There is a very high level of mutual intelligibility between Kyrgyz, Kazakh, and Altay. A dialect of Kyrgyz known as Pamiri Kyrgyz is spoken in north-eastern Afghanistan and northern Pakistan. Kyrgyz is also spoken by many ethnic Kyrgyz through the former Soviet Union, Afghanistan, Turkey, parts of northern Pakistan, and Russia.

Kyrgyz was originally written in Göktürk script, gradually replaced by the Perso-Arabic alphabet (in use until 1928 in the USSR, still in use in China). Between 1928 and 1940, a Latin-script alphabet, the Uniform Turkic Alphabet, was used. In 1940, Soviet authorities replaced the Latin script with the Cyrillic alphabet for all Turkic languages on its territory. When Kyrgyzstan became independent following the Soviet Union&#x27;s collapse in 1991, a plan to adopt the Latin alphabet became popular. Although the plan has not been implemented, it remains in occasional discussion.

== Classification ==
Kyrgyz is a Common Turkic language belonging to the Kipchak branch of the family. It is considered to be an East Kipchak language, forming a subfamily with the Southern Altai language within the greater Kipchak branch. Internally, Kyrgyz has three distinct varieties; Northern and Southern Kyrgyz. 

Language should not be confused with Old Kyrgyz (Yenisei Kyrgyz) language which classified as a member of the South Siberian branch of Turkic languages. The successor of the Yenisei Kyrgyz language today are the Khakas in Russian Federation and Fuyu Kyrgyz in Northeastern China.

==History==
In 925, when the Liao dynasty defeated the Yenisei Kyrgyz and expelled them from the Mongolian steppes, some Ancient Kyrgyz elites settled in Altai and Xinjiang where they mixed with the local Kipchaks, resulting in a language shift.

After the Mongol conquest in 1207 and a series of revolts against the Yuan dynasty, Kyrgyz-speaking tribes started to migrate to Tian Shan, which was already populated by various Turco-Mongol tribes. As Chaghatai Ulus subjects, the Kyrgyz converted to Islam. Persian and Arabic vocabulary loaned to the Kyrgyz language, but to a much lesser extent than Kazakh, Uzbek and Uyghur.

== Dialects ==
Kyrgyz is divided into two main dialects, Northern and Southern. Northern having more Mongolian loanwords and Southern having more Uzbek ones. Standard Kyrgyz is based on Northern Kyrgyz. There is also a third smaller dialect called Pamiri Kyrgyz.

==Phonology==
 appears only in borrowings from Persian or when followed by a front vowel later in the word (regressive assimilation), e.g. &#x27;sloping&#x27; instead of . In most dialects, its status as a vowel distinct from is questionable.

The United States Peace Corps trains its volunteers using a &quot;Left-Right Shift&quot; method when carrying out language training in Kyrgyzstan.

== Lexicon ==
Kyrgyz has spent centuries in contact with numerous other languages, and as such has borrowed extensively from them. These languages include: Uzbek, Oirat, Mongolian, Russian, and Arabic.

==Orthography==
Historically the Old Turkic Script was the first script used to write Kyrgyz. 

The Kyrgyz in Kyrgyzstan use a Cyrillic alphabet, which uses all the Russian letters plus ң, ө and ү. Though in the Xinjiang region of China, an Arabic alphabet is used. Between 1928 and 1940, a Latin alphabet was used for many minority languages in the USSR, including Kyrgyz. There have been attempts after 1990 to introduce other Latin alphabets which are closer to the Turkish alphabet, e.g. the Common Turkic Alphabet. There are political shades to the Cyrillic-Latin debate. In April 2023, Russia suspended dairy exports to Kyrgyzstan after a proposal by the chairman of Kyrgyzstan&#x27;s National Commission for the State Language and Language Policies, Kanybek Osmonaliev, to change the alphabet from Cyrillic to Latin to bring the country in line with other Turkic nations. Osmonaliev was reprimanded by President Sadyr Japarov, who later clarified that Kyrgyzstan had no plans to replace the Cyrillic alphabet.

== Morphology and syntax ==
Kyrgyz follows a subject-object-verb word order, Kyrgyz also has no grammatical gender with gender being implied through context. Kyrgyz lacks several analytic grammatical features that english has, these include: auxiliary verbs (ex: to have), definite articles (ex: the), indefinite articles (ex: a/an), and modal verbs (ex: should; will), dependent clauses, and subordinating conjugations (ex: that; before; while). Kyrgyz instead replaces these with various synthetic grammatical substutes.

===Case===
Nouns in Kyrgyz take a number of case endings that change based on vowel harmony and the sort of consonant they follow (see the section on phonology).

Normally the decision between the velar (, ) and uvular ( and ) pronunciation of and is based on the backness of the following vowel—i.e. back vowels imply a uvular rendering and front vowels imply a velar rendering—and the vowel in suffixes is decided based on the preceding vowel in the word. However, with the dative suffix in Kyrgyz, the vowel is decided normally, but the decision between velars and uvulars can be decided based on a contacting consonant, for example банк /bank/ &#x27;bank&#x27; + GA yields банкка , not as predicted by the following vowel.

=== Pronouns ===
Kyrgyz has eight personal pronouns:

The declension of the pronouns is outlined in the following chart. Singular pronouns (with the exception of сиз, which used to be plural) exhibit irregularities, while plural pronouns don&#x27;t. Irregular forms are highlighted in bold.

In addition to the pronouns, there are several more sets of morphemes dealing with person.

=== Verbs ===
Verbs are conjugated by analyzing the root verb: 1) determine whether the end letter is a vowel or consonant 2) add appropriate suffix while following vowel-harmony/shift rules.
==== Subordinate clauses ====
To form complement clauses, Kyrgyz nominalises verb phrases. For example, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what I saw&quot; would be:
The sentence above is also an excellent example of Kyrgyz vowel harmony; notice that all the vowel sounds are front vowels.

Several nominalisation strategies are used depending on the temporal properties of the relativised verb phrase: -GAn(dIK) for general past tense, -AAr for future/potential unrealised events, and -A turgan(dɯq) for non-perfective events are the most common. The copula has an irregular relativised form экен(дик) which may be used equivalently to forms of the verb бол- &quot;be&quot; (болгон(дук), болор). Relativised verb forms may, and often do, take nominal possessive endings as well as case endings.

== Sample text ==
Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights:

; Cyrillic script: 
; Arabic script: 
; Latin script: 
; IPA transcription: 
; English translation: All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.

<text>Molly Kathleen Ringwald (born February 18, 1968) is an American actress, writer, and translator. She began her career as a child actress on the sitcoms &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; and &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; (both 1979–1980) before being nominated for a Golden Globe for her performance in the drama film &quot;Tempest&quot; (1982). Ringwald became a teen idol following her appearances in filmmaker John Hughes&#x27; teen films &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; (1984), &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; (1985), and &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; (1986). These films led to the media referring to her as a member of the &quot;Brat Pack.&quot; Her final teen roles were in &quot;For Keeps&quot; and &quot;Fresh Horses&quot; (both in 1988).

Following leading roles in &quot;King Lear&quot; (1987), &quot;The Pick-up Artist&quot; (1987), &quot;Strike It Rich&quot; (1990), and &quot;Betsy&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (1990), Ringwald moved to Paris and began acting in French films. In subsequent decades, Ringwald acted in the television shows &quot;The Secret Life of the American Teenager&quot; (2008–2013), &quot;Riverdale&quot; (2017–2023), &quot;Creepshow&quot; (2021), &quot;Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story&quot; (2022), and &quot;&quot; (2024).

== Early life and education ==
Ringwald was born in Roseville, California, in 1968 the daughter of Adele Edith (&quot;née&quot; Frembd), a cook, and Robert Scott &quot;Bob&quot; Ringwald, a blind jazz pianist. Ringwald has two siblings, Beth and Kelly, and an older brother, who died before she was born. She is of German and Swedish descent. She started her acting career at age five, appearing in a stage production of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; as the Dormouse. The next year, she recorded &quot;Molly Sings: I Wanna Be Loved by You&quot;, a music album of Dixieland jazz with her father and his group, the Fulton Street Jazz Band. Ringwald graduated from the Lycée Français de Los Angeles.

== Career ==
In 1978 at the age of 10, Ringwald was chosen to play Kate in the West Coast production of &quot;Annie&quot;. In 1979, Ringwald appeared on the TV series &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; and was selected to become part of the large cast of that show&#x27;s spin-off, &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;. She played Molly Parker, a perky, feminist student at Eastland Girls School. At the beginning of the second season, the show underwent a major revamp, and most of the cast, including Ringwald, were cut from the show. Ringwald later said that Nancy McKeon replaced her to play a new character named Jo.

In 1980, Ringwald performed as a lead vocalist on two Disney albums. On the patriotic album &quot;Yankee Doodle Mickey&quot;, Ringwald sang &quot;This Is My Country&quot;, &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, and &quot;God Bless America&quot;. She later performed one track, &quot;The First Noel&quot;, on a Disney Christmas album, &quot;Disney&#x27;s Merry Christmas Carols&quot;. Turning toward motion pictures, she got a key supporting role in the 1982 film &quot;Tempest&quot;, directed by Paul Mazursky with top casting director Juliet Taylor, and was nominated for a Golden Globe award for the role.

Ringwald rose to prominence with her breakout role in &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; (1984). She was cast as Samantha Baker, a girl whose sixteenth birthday is forgotten by her family. Ringwald&#x27;s performance gained critical acclaim; many called her acting engaging. Ringwald later said, &quot;It is not a good idea to do remakes of great classic films&quot; when asked if there would be a remake to &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot;. Ringwald was regarded as a member of the Brat Pack of 1980s teen actors but has said she was not really part of that group. Ringwald gained more success when she was cast in another John Hughes film, &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; (1985), which was a commercial and critical success. Ringwald was cast as Claire Standish, a spoiled, wealthy beauty who is in detention for skipping class to go to the mall. Ringwald&#x27;s performance gained strong reviews.

The following year, still in high school, she was cast as Andie Walsh in another successful Hughes film, &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; (1986). When first asked to be in &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot;, Ringwald was reluctant, but after seeing how hard it was for the producers to find a replacement for her, she decided she would portray Andie in the film. Ringwald was offered a role in another John Hughes film, &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful&quot; (1987), but turned down the role as she felt it was too similar to the other films she worked on with Hughes. After &quot;Pretty In Pink&quot;, she wanted to act in more mature roles. Ringwald was featured on the cover of the May 26, 1986, issue of &quot;Time&quot;.

Ringwald was set to star in another Hughes film, &quot;Oil and Vinegar&quot;, but the film was scrapped when Hughes refused to rewrite the script. The film would have been about a soon-to-be-married man and a hitchhiking girl talking about their lives during the length of a car ride. In 1987, she was cast as Randy Jensen in &quot;The Pick-up Artist&quot;, opposite Robert Downey, Jr. in one of his first lead roles. It focused on a womanizer who meets his match when he falls for a woman in debt to the Mafia. The film was met with mixed reviews while being a moderate commercial success.

The following year, she starred in &quot;For Keeps&quot;, a commercial success that received mixed reviews from critics but was well received by audiences. It is considered Ringwald&#x27;s final teen movie. Ringwald portrayed Darcy Elliot, the editor at her high school paper, who becomes pregnant by her long-term boyfriend Stan, portrayed by Randall Batinkoff. Her performance received positive reviews. The film was praised by some critics for showing the struggles of teen pregnancy. She was later cast in &quot;Fresh Horses&quot;. The film was met with generally negative reviews and underperformed at the box office. The film also starred Andrew McCarthy, who previously worked with Ringwald in &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot;.

Ringwald was turned down for leading roles in &quot;Working Girl&quot; and &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, later commenting that: &quot;I didn&#x27;t really feel like darker roles were available to me. The ones that I wanted to do, I didn&#x27;t get.&quot; Ringwald reportedly turned down the female lead roles in &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; and &quot;Ghost&quot;. 

In the mid-1990s, Ringwald, who had been educated at the Lycée Français de Los Angeles and is fluent in French, moved to Paris and starred in several French movies. She returned to the United States intermittently to appear in American movies and television. In 1990, Ringwald appeared in the James Scott-directed &quot;Strike It Rich&quot; alongside Robert Lindsay and John Gielgud. That same year she starred in &quot;Betsy&#x27;s Wedding&quot; as Betsy Hopper. This film gained generally mixed reviews despite being a commercial success. Ringwald later starred in &quot;Something to Live for: The Alison Gertz Story&quot; (1992).

In 1994, she was cast as Frannie Goldsmith in the TV miniseries &quot;The Stand&quot;, an adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s 1978 novel of the same name. Ringwald&#x27;s performance was generally well received. She next played the leading role in the film &quot;Malicious&quot; (1995) as Melissa Nelson, a disturbed woman who has an affair with a college star baseball player. She later starred in the ABC sitcom &quot;Townies&quot;. She appeared as a blind woman on the critically acclaimed cable series &quot;Remember WENN&quot;. She starred with Lara Flynn Boyle and Teri Hatcher in the 1998 made-for-television film &quot;Since You&#x27;ve Been Gone&quot;. In 1999, she played the starring role of &quot;Li&#x27;l Bit&quot; in Paula Vogel&#x27;s play &quot;How I Learned to Drive&quot; at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles. In 2000, she appeared in an episode of Showtime&#x27;s &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, &quot;Judgment Day&quot;.
In 2000, Ringwald appeared in the ensemble restaurant-themed film &quot;In the Weeds&quot;, and in 2001 she had a cameo in the commercially successful &quot;Not Another Teen Movie&quot; that earned her an MTV Movie Award nomination. In theater, she wore a &quot;Green, Green Dress&quot; as Susan in Jonathan Larson&#x27;s Off-Broadway musical &quot;tick, tick... BOOM!&quot;, and headlined as Sally Bowles in Broadway&#x27;s long-running revival of &quot;Cabaret&quot; from 2001 to 2002. In 2003, Ringwald appeared in &quot;Enchanted April&quot; on Broadway.

In 2004, she starred in the play &quot;Modern Orthodox&quot; on Broadway, opposite Jason Biggs and Craig Bierko. In 2006 she starred in the television film &quot;The Wives He Forgot&quot;, and that fall and winter starred as Charity Hope Valentine in the national tour of the Broadway revival of the musical &quot;Sweet Charity&quot;. She also played a supporting role as Molly McIntire&#x27;s mother Helen in &quot;&quot;. Ringwald starred in the ABC Family network&#x27;s series &quot;The Secret Life of the American Teenager&quot;, which ran for five seasons and 121 episodes between 2008 and 2013. She played Anne Juergens, the protagonist&#x27;s mother.

Ringwald played Madame Frechette in the 2014 Lifetime Christmas film &quot;Wishin&#x27; and Hopin&#x27;&quot;. Ringwald plays Aunt Bailey in &quot;Jem and the Holograms&quot;, raising Jerrica, her sister Kimber, and adopted daughters. In 2016, she was cast as Amy in the crime-drama film &quot;King Cobra&quot;. Ringwald had a recurring role as main character Archie Andrews&#x27; mother Mary Andrews on The CW television series &quot;Riverdale&quot;. After initially only appearing as a guest, Ringwald took a more prominent role in the series following the death of Luke Perry who played Archie&#x27;s father.

== Other ventures ==

Ringwald has translated two books from French to English. The first was the novel &quot;Lie with Me&quot; by Philippe Besson. The second was &quot;My Cousin Maria Schneider&quot; by Vanessa Schneider, a book about the French actress Maria Schneider, whose career was largely defined by a sex scene with Marlon Brando in the film &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot; despite her many other accomplishments as an actress.

Ringwald read the audiobook edition of the 2012 novel &quot;The Middlesteins&quot; by Jami Attenberg. In 2013, Ringwald released &quot;Except Sometimes&quot;, a jazz record. It follows a tradition in jazz for the Ringwald family set by her father. &quot;I grew up in a home filled with music and had an early appreciation of jazz since my dad was a jazz musician. Beginning at around age three I started singing with his band and jazz music has continued to be one of my three passions along with acting and writing. I like to say jazz music is my musical equivalent of comfort food. It&#x27;s always where I go back to when I want to feel grounded,&quot; Ringwald said in a statement.

In 2014, Ringwald began writing an advice column for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, answering questions about &quot;love, family, or life in general&quot;.

In February 2024, Ringwald made her runway modeling debut at New York Fashion Week, walking for Batsheva. 

== Media image ==
Ringwald stated she was very aware of her public image during her teen years and she tried to be a good role model for her fans. When asked about &quot;For Keeps&quot; (1988), Ringwald said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to give the wrong message to teenagers. I sort of felt a certain responsibility – I mean, I was a very, very famous teenager and I thought a lot of teenagers were looking up to me and emulating me, and I really didn&#x27;t want to make a movie that said in any way that having a baby at that age was going to be easy.&quot;

== Personal life ==
In the 1980s, Ringwald dated musician Dweezil Zappa and rapper Ad-Rock of the hip-hop group Beastie Boys.

Ringwald married Valéry Lameignère, a French writer, in Bordeaux, France, on July 28, 1999; they divorced in 2002. She married Panio Gianopoulos, a Greek-American writer and book editor, in 2007. They have a daughter, Mathilda, born in 2003, and fraternal twins, daughter Adele Georgiana and son Roman Stylianos, born in July 2009. Her pregnancy was written into the storyline of &quot;The Secret Life of the American Teenager&quot;. She was the subject of an episode in season 7 of the genealogy series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;.

<text>John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir (; 26 August 1875 – 11 February 1940) was a Scottish novelist, historian, and Unionist politician who served as Governor General of Canada, the 15th since Canadian Confederation.

As a youth, Buchan began writing poetry and prose, fiction and non-fiction, publishing his first novel in 1895 and ultimately writing over a hundred books of which the best known is &quot;The Thirty-Nine Steps&quot;. After attending Glasgow and Oxford universities, he practised as a barrister. In 1901, he served as a private secretary to Lord Milner in southern Africa towards the end of the Boer War. He returned to England in 1903, continued as a barrister and journalist. He left the Bar when he joined Thomas Nelson and Sons publishers in 1907. During the First World War, he was, among other activities, Director of Information in 1917 and later Head of Intelligence at the newly-formed Ministry of Information. He was elected Member of Parliament for the Combined Scottish Universities in 1927.

In 1935, King George V, on the advice of Canadian Prime Minister R. B. Bennett, appointed Buchan to succeed the Earl of Bessborough as Governor General of Canada and two months later raised him to the peerage as Baron Tweedsmuir. He occupied the post until his death in 1940. Buchan promoted Canadian unity and helped strengthen the sovereignty of Canada constitutionally and culturally. He received a state funeral in Canada before his ashes were returned to the United Kingdom.

==Early life and education==
Buchan was born at today&#x27;s 18–20 York Place, a double villa now named after him, in Perth, Scotland. He was the first child of John Buchan – a Free Church of Scotland minister – and Helen Jane Buchan (née Masterton). He was brought up in Kirkcaldy, Fife, and spent many summer holidays with his maternal grandparents in Broughton in the Scottish Borders. There he developed a love for walking and for the local scenery and wildlife, both of which are often featured in his novels. The protagonist in several of his books is Sir Edward Leithen, whose name is borrowed from Leithen Water, a tributary of the River Tweed.

After the family moved to Glasgow, Buchan attended Hutchesons&#x27; Boys&#x27; Grammar School. He was awarded a scholarship to the University of Glasgow at age 17, where he studied classics as a student of Gilbert Murray, wrote poetry, and became a published author. He moved on to study &quot;Literae Humaniores&quot; (&quot;the Classics&quot;) at Brasenose College, Oxford, with a Junior Hulme scholarship in 1895 and in his third year achieved a Senior Hulme scholarship, adding to his financial security. At Oxford, he made many friends including Raymond Asquith, Aubrey Herbert and Tommy Nelson. Buchan won the Stanhope essay prize in 1897 and the Newdigate Prize for poetry the following year; he was also elected as the president of the Oxford Union and had six of his works published, including a book of short stories (&quot;Grey Weather&quot;, 1899) and three of his first adventure novels (&quot;John Burnet of Barns&quot;, 1898; &quot;A Lost Lady of Old Years&quot;, 1899; &quot;The Half-Hearted&quot;, 1900)

Buchan had his first portrait painted in 1900 by a young Sholto Johnstone Douglas at around the time of his graduation from Oxford.

==Author, journalist, war, and politics ==

After graduating from Oxford, Buchan read for and was called to the Bar in June 1901. In September 1901 he travelled to South Africa to become a private secretary to Alfred Milner, who was then the High Commissioner for Southern Africa, Governor of Cape Colony, and colonial administrator of Transvaal and the Orange River Colony, making Buchan an early member of Milner&#x27;s Kindergarten. He also gained an acquaintance with a country that would feature prominently in his writing, which he resumed, along with his career as a barrister, upon his return to London in 1903. In 1905, he published a legal book, &quot;The Law Relating to the Taxation of Foreign Income.&quot; In December 1906, he joined the Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons&#x27; publishing company and was also a deputy editor of &quot;The Spectator&quot;. On 15 July 1907, Buchan married Susan Charlotte Grosvenor—daughter of the Hon. Norman Grosvenor, a son of the 1st Lord Ebury, and a cousin of the Duke of Westminster. Together, Buchan and his wife had four children, Alice, John, William, and Alastair.

In 1910, Buchan wrote &quot;Prester John&quot;, set in South Africa, another of his adventure novels. He began to suffer from duodenal ulcers, a condition that later afflicted one of his fictional characters, about the same time that he ventured into politics and was adopted as Unionist candidate in March 1911 for the Scottish Borders seat of Peebles and Selkirk. He supported some Liberal causes, such as free trade, women&#x27;s suffrage, national insurance, and curtailing the powers of the House of Lords. But he did not support Home Rule in Ireland and what he considered the class hatred fostered by Liberal politicians such as David Lloyd George.

With the outbreak of the First World War, Buchan began writing a history of the war for Nelson&#x27;s, the publishers, which was to extend to 24 volumes by the end of the war. He worked in the Foreign Office, and for a time was a war correspondent in France for &quot;The Times&quot; in 1915. In that same year, his most famous novel, &quot;The Thirty-Nine Steps&quot;, a spy-thriller set just prior to the First World War, was published. The novel featured Buchan&#x27;s oft-used hero, Richard Hannay, whose character was partly based on Edmund Ironside, a friend of Buchan from his days in South Africa. A sequel, &quot;Greenmantle&quot;, came the following year. In June 1916 Buchan was sent out to the Western Front to be attached to the British Army&#x27;s General Headquarters Intelligence Section, to assist with drafting official communiques for the press. On arrival he received a field-commission as a second lieutenant in the Intelligence Corps.

Recognised for his abilities, the War Cabinet, under David Lloyd George, appointed him Director of Information in 1917, essentially leading Britain&#x27;s propaganda effort. In early 1918, Buchan was made head of a Department of Intelligence within a new Ministry of Information under Lord Beaverbrook. Throughout the war, he continued writing volumes of the &quot;History of the War&quot;. It was difficult for him, given his close connections to many of Britain&#x27;s military leaders, not to mention the government, to be critical of the British Army&#x27;s conduct during the conflict but nonetheless did so in certain instances, being critical of government, politics or statements, or disagreeing with statistics. Buchan could enter comment on political events. He complimented Winston Churchill&#x27;s &quot;services to the nation at the outbreak of war for which his countrymen can never be sufficiently grateful ... but he was usually selected to be blamed for decisions for which his colleagues were not less responsible.&quot;

At one point, Beaverbrook had requested that Buchan meet with journalist and neo-Jacobite Herbert Vivian and admitted to Vivian that he had been a Jacobite sympathiser. Buchan was in fact ambivalent about the Jacobite cause but he did write romances about that adventurous period, for example, &quot;A Lost Lady of Old Years&quot; (1899), &quot;A Book of Escapes and Hurried Journeys&quot; (1922) and &quot;Midwinter&quot; (1923).

Following the close of the war, Buchan turned his attention to writing on historical subjects, along with his usual thrillers and novels. He moved to Elsfield, Oxfordshire in 1920 and had become president of the Scottish Historical Society and a trustee of the National Library of Scotland, and he also maintained ties with various universities. Robert Graves, who lived in nearby Islip, mentioned his being recommended by Buchan for a lecturing position at the newly founded Cairo University. In a 1927 by-election, Buchan was elected as the Unionist Party Member of Parliament for the Combined Scottish Universities. Politically, he was of the Unionist-Nationalist tradition, believing in Scotland&#x27;s promotion as a nation within the British Empire but also as a constituent of the United Kingdom.&quot; The effects of the Great Depression in Scotland, and the subsequent high emigration from that country, also led him to reflect in the same speech: &quot;We do not want to be like the Greeks, powerful and prosperous wherever we settle, but with a dead Greece behind us&quot;. He found himself profoundly affected by John Morley&#x27;s &quot;Life of Gladstone&quot;, which Buchan read in the early months of the Second World War. He believed that Gladstone had taught people to combat materialism, complacency, and authoritarianism; Buchan later wrote to Herbert Fisher, Stair Gillon, and Gilbert Murray that he was &quot;becoming a Gladstonian Liberal.&quot;

After the United Free Church of Scotland joined in 1929 with the Church of Scotland, Buchan remained an active elder of St Columba&#x27;s Church, London. In 1933 and 1934, Buchan was further appointed as King George V&#x27;s Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.

Beginning in 1930, Buchan aligned himself with Zionism. He was active and vocal in Parliament in condemning the treatment of Jews in Germany. To a mass demonstration organized by the Jewish National Fund in 1934, Buchan described Zionism as &quot;a great act of justice ... a reparation for the centuries of cruelty and wrong which have stained the record of nearly every Gentile people.&quot; He was a friend of Chaim Weizmann and assisted him to keep alive Britain&#x27;s commitment to a Jewish state. 

As a supporter of the Jewish people and a homeland, Buchan&#x27;s name was inscribed in the Golden Book of the Jewish National Fund of Israel. His name was also in a Nazi publication, &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in Britain&quot; (Frankfurt, 1938), reading &quot;Tweedsmuir, Lord: Pro-Jewish activity. In one history of the Jewish experience in Canada, Buchan, as Governor-General Lord Tweedsmuir, is described as the &quot;most visible supporter&quot; of the Jews. Both Tweedsmuir and his wife Susan &quot;spoke publicly in favour of Zionism, lending the cachet of the Crown&quot; to the cause of a Jewish homeland. Susan Tweedsmuir&#x27;s name was also entered into the Golden Book.

In recognition of his contributions to literature and education, on 1 January 1932, Buchan was granted the personal gift of the sovereign of induction into the Order of the Companions of Honour.

Having previously advocated in the House of Commons for the establishment of a public body for film in the mould of the BBC, Buchan was appointed among the first nine Governors of the British Film Institute after its formation in 1933. Buchan remained in the role until his appointment as Governor General of Canada in 1935.

In 1935, Buchan&#x27;s literary work was adapted for the cinema with the release of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The 39 Steps&quot;, starring Robert Donat as Richard Hannay, although Buchan&#x27;s story was much altered. This came in the same year that Buchan was honoured with appointment to the Order of St Michael and St George on 23 May, as well as being elevated to the peerage, when he was ennobled by King George V as Baron Tweedsmuir, of Elsfield in the County of Oxford on 1 June. This had been done in preparation for Buchan&#x27;s appointment as Canada&#x27;s governor general; when consulted by Canadian prime minister R. B. Bennett about the appointment, the Leader of His Majesty&#x27;s Loyal Opposition, William Lyon Mackenzie King, recommended that the King allow Buchan to serve as a commoner, but George V insisted that he be represented by a peer.

Buchan&#x27;s name had been earlier put forward by Mackenzie King to George V as a candidate for the governor generalcy: Buchan and his wife had been guests of Mackenzie King&#x27;s at his estate, Kingsmere, in 1924 and Mackenzie King, who at that time was prime minister, was impressed with Buchan, stating, &quot;I know no man I would rather have as a friend, a beautiful, noble soul, kindly &amp; generous in thought &amp; word &amp; act, informed as few men in this world have ever been, modest, humble, true, man after God&#x27;s own heart.&quot; One evening in the following year, the Prime Minister mentioned to Governor General the Lord Byng of Vimy that Buchan would be a suitable successor to Byng, with which the Governor General agreed, the two being friends. Word of this reached the British Cabinet, and Buchan was approached, but he was reluctant to take the posting; Byng had been writing to Buchan about the constitutional dispute that took place in June 1926 and spoke disparagingly of Mackenzie King.

==Governor General of Canada==

On 27 March 1935, Sir George Halsey Perley announced in the Canadian Parliament (in place of ailing Conservative Prime Minister Richard Bedford Bennett) that the King had appointed Mr. John Buchan as the viceregal representative. The King approved the appointment, made by commission under the royal sign-manual and signet. Buchan, by this time elevated to the peerage as the first Baron Tweedsmuir, then departed for Canada and was sworn in as the country&#x27;s Governor General in a ceremony on 2 November 1935 in the Legislative Council of Quebec (salon rouge) of the parliament buildings of Quebec.

By the time Lord Tweedsmuir arrived in Canada, William Lyon Mackenzie King had been sworn in as Prime Minister after the Liberal Party won the federal election held the previous month. Tweedsmuir was the first Governor General of Canada appointed since the enactment of the Statute of Westminster on 11 December 1931, and was thus the first to have been decided on solely by the monarch of Canada in his Canadian council.

Tweedsmuir brought to the post a longstanding knowledge of Canada. He had written many appreciative words about the country as a journalist on &quot;The Spectator&quot; and had followed the actions of the Canadian forces in the First World War when writing &quot;Nelson&#x27;s History of the War&quot;, and was helped by talks with Julian Byng, during a visit Canada in 1924. He had also written a memoir of a previous Governor General, Lord Minto (1898–1904), published in 1924. His knowledge and interest in increasing public awareness and accessibility to Canada&#x27;s past resulted in Tweedsmuir being made the Champlain Society&#x27;s second honorary president between 1938 and 1939. He continued writing during his time in Canada, but he also took his position as Governor General seriously, and from the outset made it his goal to travel the length and breadth of Canada, including to the Arctic regions, and promoting Canadian unity in the process. He said of his job: &quot;a Governor General is in a unique position for it is his duty to know the whole of Canada and all the various types of her people.&quot;

Tweedsmuir encouraged a distinct Canadian identity as well as national unity, despite the ongoing Great Depression and the difficulty it caused for the population. He strengthened the sovereignty of Canada, constitutionally and culturally. However, not all Canadians shared Buchan&#x27;s views. He aroused the ire of imperialists when he said in Montreal in 1937: &quot;a Canadian&#x27;s first loyalty is not to the British Commonwealth of Nations, but to Canada, and to Canada&#x27;s King,&quot; a statement that the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; dubbed as &quot;disloyal&quot; but that was largely because the news release did not include &quot;and to Canada&#x27;s King&quot; which Tweedsmuir had added by hand to his typed draft after it had been distributed to the media. Tweedsmuir stated that ethnic groups &quot;should retain their individuality and each make its contribution to the national character&quot; and &quot;the strongest nations are those that are made up of different racial elements.&quot;

George V died in late January 1936, and his eldest son, the popular Prince of Wales, succeeded to the throne as Edward VIII. Rideau Hall—the royal and viceroyal residence in Ottawa—was decked in black crepe and all formal entertaining was cancelled during the official period of mourning. As the year unfolded, it became evident that the new king planned to marry the American divorcée Wallis Simpson, which caused much discontent throughout the Dominions and created a constitutional crisis. Tweedsmuir conveyed to Buckingham Palace and the British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin Canadians&#x27; deep affection for the King, but also the outrage to Canadian religious feelings, both Catholic and Protestant, that would occur if Edward married Simpson. By 11 December, King Edward had abdicated in favour of his younger brother, Prince Albert, Duke of York, who was thereafter known as George VI. In order for the line of succession for Canada to remain parallel to those of the other Dominions, Tweedsmuir, as Governor-in-Council, gave the government&#x27;s consent to the British legislation formalising the abdication, and ratified this with finality when he granted Royal Assent to the Canadian Succession to the Throne Act in 1937. Upon receiving news from Mackenzie King of Edward&#x27;s decision to abdicate, Tweedsmuir quipped that, in his year in Canada as governor general, he had represented three kings.

Tweedsmuir&#x27;s desire to strengthen the culture of Canada is reflected in his approval of the establishment of the Governor General&#x27;s Literary Awards in 1936. This was done after discussion with the Canadian Authors Association, under the chairmanship of Dr. Pelham Edgar. The &quot;GGs&quot;, as they are nicknamed in Canada, remain Canada&#x27;s premier literary awards, announced annually, now with seven categories in English and in French. Tweedsmuir also inspired and encouraged individual writers. In January 1940, despite the war, Tweedsmuir invited influential Canadians to Rideau Hall, including Sam McLaughlin, President of General Motors of Canada, to support, as he wrote to his sister in Scotland, the development of &quot;a Hollywood in British Columbia&quot;. This proved prescient; by the 21st century, Vancouver had popularly become known as &quot;Hollywood North&quot;.

In May and June 1939, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth toured Canada from coast to coast and paid a state visit to the United States. Tweedsmuir had conceived the royal tour before the coronation in 1937; according to the official event historian, Gustave Lanctot, the idea &quot;probably grew out of the knowledge that at his coming Coronation, George VI was to assume the additional title of King of Canada,&quot; and he wished to demonstrate vividly Canada&#x27;s status as an independent kingdom by allowing Canadians to see &quot;their King performing royal functions, supported by his Canadian ministers.&quot; Mackenzie King, however, was not convinced, thinking it wrong to spend money on royalty while the poor were starving. To overcome King&#x27;s reticence, Tweedsmuir argued that the royal visit &quot;would have a &#x27;unifying&#x27; effect on Canada while the visit to the U.S. would be &quot;helpful to relations of democracies. Mackenzie King agreed. Tweedsmuir put great effort into securing a positive response from Buckingham Palace to the invitation; after more than a year without a reply, in June 1938 he used a trip to the United Kingdom for a rest cure at Ruthin Castle in Wales to procure a positive decision on the royal tour. After a period of convalescence at Ruthin Castle and his home near Oxford, Tweedsmuir sailed back to Canada in October with a secured commitment that the royal couple would tour the country and visit the United States. Though he had been a significant contributor to the organisation of the trip, Tweedsmuir remained largely out of sight for the duration of the royal tour; he expressed the view that while the King of Canada was present, &quot;I cease to exist as Viceroy, and retain only a shadowy legal existence as Governor-General in Council.&quot; In Canada, the royal couple took part in public events such as the opening of the Lions Gate Bridge in Vancouver in May 1939, and King George sat in Parliament and personally granted Royal Assent to bills passed there. The King appointed Tweedsmuir a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order while on the royal train, between Truro and Bedford, Nova Scotia. The King and Queen began their visit to the United States on 8 June.

The royal visit to the United States was the high point of Tweedsmuir&#x27;s efforts to develop a strong relationship with President Roosevelt, which he began soon after his arrival in Canada. The objective was to demonstrate, especially to the dictators in Europe, the friendship of America with Canada, as a member of the British Empire and Commonwealth. Roosevelt had to be circumspect and not be seen to have direct relations with Britain because of the strong isolationist opinion in the U.S. concerned about being dragged into another European war. Tweedsmuir and Roosevelt met twice, at the end of July 1936 in Quebec City, summer residence of the Governor General, and the second in the spring of 1937 with an official visit by the Tweedsmuirs to Washington, D.C. Both visits were significant successes. 

Buchan&#x27;s experiences during the First World War made him averse to war, and he tried to help prevent another one in co-ordination with Mackenzie King and the U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt by the calling of a conference, to be chaired by the U.S. and to include the European dictators. Those efforts to try to secure future peace and stability proved fruitless because the British Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, refused to countenance the idea. 

Tweedsmuir signed Canada&#x27;s declaration of war against Germany on 10 September, a week after the British declaration of war. The week difference allowed war-related materiel, such as aeroplanes and munitions, to move to Canada from the neutral United States, which was prohibited under the Neutrality Act from exporting such materiel to belligerents. During the fall of 1939, negotiations were held to establish an air training plan in Canada for Commonwealth air crew. The negotiations were long and difficult, in particular with Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King who was adamant that the facilities would be under the control of the Canadian government. Tweedsmuir had known from previous experience with a British mission, which had examined the possibility of aircraft production in Canada in the spring of 1938, that officials in Britain &quot;do not seem to understand the real delicacy of the position of the self-governing Dominions, especially Canada. King had been difficult, as Chamberlain admitted to Tweedsmuir. Tweedsmuir played a key role in securing British agreement to the final negotiations in mid-December 1939 and King acknowledged this in a letter, thank the Governor General &quot;warmly for the help ... What a mischief there would have been had there been another moment&#x27;s delay!&quot; 
On 6 February 1940, he suffered a slight stroke and struck his head on the edge of a bath at Rideau Hall. Two surgeries by Doctor Wilder Penfield of the Montreal Neurological Institute were insufficient to save him, and his death on 11 February saw an outpouring of grief, gratitude and admiration, not only in Canada but throughout the English-speaking world. In a radio eulogy, Mackenzie King stated: &quot;In the passing of His Excellency, the people of Canada have lost one of the greatest and most revered of their Governors General, and a friend who, from the day of his arrival in this country, dedicated his life to their service.&quot; The editor of the &quot;Ottawa Journal&quot; wrote: &quot;He would have prepared us by deeper concern for things spiritual and intellectual, and by allegiance, above all, to the tradition of human dignity and liberty.&quot; The Governor General had formed a strong bond with his prime minister, even if it may have been built more on political admiration than friendship: Mackenzie King appreciated Buchan&#x27;s &quot;sterling rectitude and disinterested purpose.&quot;

After lying in state in the Senate chamber on Parliament Hill, Buchan was given a state funeral at St Andrew&#x27;s Presbyterian Church in Ottawa. His ashes were returned to the UK aboard the cruiser HMS &quot;Orion&quot; for final burial at Elsfield, the village where he lived in Oxfordshire. In the United Kingdom, a memorial service was held in medieval Elsfield church on the Saturday after his death and services were held later that month at Westminster Abbey and at St. Giles Cathedral in Edinburgh.

==Charges of anti-semitism, racism and imperialism==
Despite Buchan&#x27;s support of Zionism late in life, there are conflicting views as to whether his personal views were overtly anti-semitic, imperialistic and/or racist, at least in the period when he wrote his early novels.

The &quot;Penguin Companion to English Literature&quot; characterized him as a &quot;convinced imperialist&quot; and commented: &quot;He tells a yarn with economy. The implications of his social and political ideas, conscious and unconscious, are less admirable.&quot; A 1996 article in the Scottish newspaper The Herald (Glasgow) opined that Buchan&#x27;s poem &quot;The Semitic Spirit Speaks&quot; &quot;is poisoned by prejudice&quot;. Buchan was described as being &quot;overtly antisemitic&quot; by author Anthony Starr. The critic Roger Kimball maintained that &quot;some of [Buchan&#x27;s] attitude and language&quot; could be interpreted as those of &quot;a colonialist ... a racist ... an anti-Semite.&quot; Kimball acknowledged that the attitudes and language about Jews and blacks in Buchan&#x27;s novels are voices of fictional characters but also opines that it is &quot;likely&quot; that Buchan was &quot;anti-Semitic (and anti-foreigner) in the way nearly everyone in his society was,&quot; at least until the 1930s. 

Buchan&#x27;s granddaughter Ursula claimed that the charge of anti-semitism is almost entirely the result of some unfavourable comments made by his fictional characters, and are not necessarily the views of the author. She points out that in &quot;The Thirty-Nine Steps,&quot; the anti-semitic comments of the murdered freelance spy Scudder are called &#x27;eyewash&#x27; by the narrator and proved to be totally wrong by later events. She cautions, &quot;[r]acial and national stereotyping, favourable and unfavourable, was commonplace throughout all society&quot; so &quot;it is hardly surprising that characters in JB&#x27;s novels should engage in it.&quot;

==Legacy==
When Buchan died in Canada in February 1940 as Governor General Lord Tweedsmuir, he was widely and deeply mourned throughout the English-speaking world and beyond, both as writer and statesman. His last role gave emphasis to him as statesman but it is as a writer of popular thrillers for which he is mostly remembered now. Novelist Graham Greene wrote, eleven years after Tweedsmuir&#x27;s death, that the settings, pace and pursuits in &quot;The Thirty-Nine Steps&quot; &quot;were to be a pattern for adventure-writers ever since.&quot; He and his brother Hugh co-authored &quot;The Spy&#x27;s Bedside Book&quot; and dedicated it &quot;To the Immortal Memory of Wm Le Queux and John Buchan.&quot; Fifty years after Buchan&#x27;s death, historian David Stafford wrote that &quot;his impact on the genre was profound, and he has left a mark that has remained strong to this day.&quot; J.R.R. Tolkien admired and was influenced by Buchan&#x27;s adventure stories. And it continues. Distinguished military historian Sir John Keegan in 2004 wrote that Buchan &quot;was a writer touched by genius.&quot; In a list of &quot;The 100 best novels written in English, &quot;The Guardian newspaper&quot; in 2015 placed &quot;The Thirty-Nine Steps&quot; at 42nd. 

Buchan&#x27;s 100 works and more include nearly 30 novels, seven collections of short stories, and biographies of Sir Walter Scott, Caesar Augustus, and Oliver Cromwell. He was awarded the 1928 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for his biography of the Marquess of Montrose. The &quot;last Buchan&quot; (as Graham Greene entitled his appreciative review) was the 1941 novel &quot;Sick Heart River&quot; (American title: &quot;Mountain Meadow&quot;), in which a dying protagonist confronts the questions of the meaning of life in the Canadian wilderness.

In Canada as Governor General, he founded the Governor General&#x27;s Literary Awards, which remain Canada&#x27;s premier awards for literature. He and Lady Tweedsmuir established the first proper library at Rideau Hall. His grandchildren Ursula, David, James and Perdita Buchan also became journalists and/or writers. His granddaughter Ursula wrote a biography of him, &quot;Beyond the Thirty-Nine Steps: A Life of John Buchan&quot; (2019).

As Governor General and statesman, he helped strengthen relations between Britain and America, via his position in Canada as a prominent member of the British Commonwealth, at a critical period in world history. His breadth of experience, interests, knowledge and vision allowed him to be an interpreter of Britain, Canada, and the United States to each other. His contribution to Canada, reflecting his accomplishments and character, were recognized when the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada designated John Buchan, Lord Tweedsmuir, as a &quot;person of national historic significance&quot; in 2010. He left a living legacy in that at least four of his Canadian successors admired or took inspiration from his approach to the role of Governor General: Vincent Massey (1952-1959); General Georges Vanier (1959-1967); Adrienne Clarkson (1999-2005); and David Johnston (2010-2017).

Tweedsmuir Provincial Park in British Columbia is now divided into Tweedsmuir South Provincial Park and Tweedsmuir North Provincial Park and Protected Area. It was created in 1938 to commemorate Buchan&#x27;s 1937 visit to the Rainbow Range and other nearby areas by horseback and floatplane. He wrote in the foreword to a booklet published to commemorate his visit: &quot;I have now travelled over most of Canada and have seen many wonderful things, but I have seen nothing more beautiful and more wonderful than the great park which British Columbia has done me the honour to call by my name&quot;.

Canadian history professor Roger Hall noted in a book review that &quot;a great deal of [Buchan&#x27;s] success resulted from the extraordinary person he was, adding that &quot;[n]ot many of our contemporary [Governor General] candidates come with those credentials&quot; and &quot;[I]n the end it is Buchan&#x27;s role as a moral compass that seems most worthy.&quot; Buchan&#x27;s moral certainty was, as historian Sir John Keegan wrote, &quot;one of his strengths as a writer [giving] him the power to achieve something particularly elusive: moral atmosphere.&quot; 

John Buchan was and is an “inspiring example of a life lived for others”, as Ursula Buchan has written, from humble origins “without money or family influence, he nevertheless carved out a hugely successful writing and public career … His strengths, underpinned by a sincere and unwavering Christian faith, were his intelligence, humanity, clarity of thought, wit, moral and physical courage, a capacity to get on with everybody, from monarchs to miners, and an elegant prose style that appealed to a very wide readership.”

<doc id="84936" wikidata="Q221694" url="?curid=84936" title="Blood–brain barrier">
<text>The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a highly selective semipermeable border of endothelial cells that regulates the transfer of solutes and chemicals between the circulatory system and the central nervous system, thus protecting the brain from harmful or unwanted substances in the blood. The blood–brain barrier is formed by endothelial cells of the capillary wall, astrocyte end-feet ensheathing the capillary, and pericytes embedded in the capillary basement membrane. This system allows the passage of some small molecules by passive diffusion, as well as the selective and active transport of various nutrients, ions, organic anions, and macromolecules such as glucose and amino acids that are crucial to neural function.

The blood–brain barrier restricts the passage of pathogens, the diffusion of solutes in the blood, and large or hydrophilic molecules into the cerebrospinal fluid, while allowing the diffusion of hydrophobic molecules (O2, CO2, hormones) and small non-polar molecules. Cells of the barrier actively transport metabolic products such as glucose across the barrier using specific transport proteins. The barrier also restricts the passage of peripheral immune factors, like signaling molecules, antibodies, and immune cells, into the central nervous system, thus insulating the brain from damage due to peripheral immune events.

Specialized brain structures participating in sensory and secretory integration within brain neural circuits—the circumventricular organs and choroid plexus—have in contrast highly permeable capillaries.

==Structure==

The BBB results from the selectivity of the tight junctions between the endothelial cells of brain capillaries, restricting the passage of solutes. At the interface between blood and the brain, endothelial cells are adjoined continuously by these tight junctions, which are composed of smaller subunits of transmembrane proteins, such as occludin, claudins (such as Claudin-5), junctional adhesion molecule (such as JAM-A). Each of these tight junction proteins is stabilized to the endothelial cell membrane by another protein complex that includes scaffolding proteins such as tight junction protein 1 (ZO1) and associated proteins.

The BBB is composed of endothelial cells restricting passage of substances from the blood more selectively than endothelial cells of capillaries elsewhere in the body. Astrocyte cell projections called astrocytic feet (also known as &quot;glia limitans&quot;) surround the endothelial cells of the BBB, providing biochemical support to those cells. The BBB is distinct from the quite similar blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, which is a function of the choroidal cells of the choroid plexus, and from the blood-retinal barrier, which can be considered a part of the whole realm of such barriers.

Not all vessels in the human brain exhibit BBB properties. Some examples of this include the circumventricular organs, the roof of the third and fourth ventricles, capillaries in the pineal gland on the roof of the diencephalon and the pineal gland.

===Development===
The BBB appears to be functional by the time of birth. P-glycoprotein, a transporter, exists already in the embryonal endothelium.

Measurement of brain uptake of various blood-borne solutes showed that newborn endothelial cells were functionally similar to those in adults, indicating that a selective BBB is operative at birth.

== Function ==

The blood–brain barrier acts effectively to protect brain tissue from circulating pathogens and other potentially toxic substances. Accordingly, blood-borne infections of the brain are rare. Infections of the brain that do occur are often difficult to treat. Antibodies are too large to cross the blood–brain barrier, and only certain antibiotics are able to pass. In some cases, a drug has to be administered directly into the cerebrospinal fluid where it can enter the brain by crossing the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier.

===Circumventricular organs===

Circumventricular organs (CVOs) are individual structures located adjacent to the fourth ventricle or third ventricle in the brain, and are characterized by dense capillary beds with permeable endothelial cells unlike those of the blood–brain barrier. Included among CVOs having highly permeable capillaries are the area postrema, subfornical organ, vascular organ of the lamina terminalis, median eminence, pineal gland, and three lobes of the pituitary gland.

Permeable capillaries of the sensory CVOs (area postrema, subfornical organ, vascular organ of the lamina terminalis) enable rapid detection of circulating signals in systemic blood, while those of the secretory CVOs (median eminence, pineal gland, pituitary lobes) facilitate transport of brain-derived signals into the circulating blood. Consequently, the CVO permeable capillaries are the point of bidirectional blood–brain communication for neuroendocrine function.

===Specialized permeable zones===
The border zones between brain tissue &quot;behind&quot; the blood–brain barrier and zones &quot;open&quot; to blood signals in certain CVOs contain specialized hybrid capillaries that are leakier than typical brain capillaries, but not as permeable as CVO capillaries. Such zones exist at the border of the area postrema—nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS), and median eminence—hypothalamic arcuate nucleus. These zones appear to function as rapid transit regions for brain structures involved in diverse neural circuits—like the NTS and arcuate nucleus—to receive blood signals which are then transmitted into neural output. The permeable capillary zone shared between the median eminence and hypothalamic arcuate nucleus is augmented by wide pericapillary spaces, facilitating bidirectional flow of solutes between the two structures, and indicating that the median eminence is not only a secretory organ, but may also be a sensory organ.

==Therapeutic research==
===As a drug target===
The blood–brain barrier is formed by the brain capillary endothelium and excludes from the brain 100% of large-molecule neurotherapeutics and more than 98% of all small-molecule drugs. Overcoming the difficulty of delivering therapeutic agents to specific regions of the brain presents a major challenge to treatment of most brain disorders. In its neuroprotective role, the blood–brain barrier functions to hinder the delivery of many potentially important diagnostic and therapeutic agents to the brain. Therapeutic molecules and antibodies that might otherwise be effective in diagnosis and therapy do not cross the BBB in adequate amounts to be clinically effective. To overcome this problem some peptides able to naturally cross the BBB have been widely investigated as a drug delivery system.

Mechanisms for drug targeting in the brain involve going either &quot;through&quot; or &quot;behind&quot; the BBB. Modalities for drug delivery to the brain in unit doses through the BBB entail its disruption by osmotic means, or biochemically by the use of vasoactive substances, such as bradykinin, or even by localized exposure to high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU).

Other methods used to get through the BBB may entail the use of endogenous transport systems, including carrier-mediated transporters, such as glucose and amino acid carriers, receptor-mediated transcytosis for insulin or transferrin, and the blocking of active efflux transporters such as p-glycoprotein. Some studies have shown that vectors targeting BBB transporters, such as the transferrin receptor, have been found to remain entrapped in brain endothelial cells of capillaries, instead of being ferried across the BBB into the targeted area.

====Intranasal administration====

The brain can be targeted non-invasively via the nasal passage. The drugs that remain in the passage after mucociliary clearance, enter the brain via three pathways: (1) Olfactory nerve-olfactory bulb-brain; (2) Trigeminal nerve-brain; and (3) Lungs/ Gastrointestinal tract-blood–brain The first and second methods involve the nerves, so they use the neuronal pathway and the third is via systemic circulation. However, these methods are less efficient to deliver drugs as they are indirect methods.

====Nanoparticles====

Nanotechnology is under preliminary research for its potential to facilitate the transfer of drugs across the BBB. Capillary endothelial cells and associated pericytes may be abnormal in tumors and the blood–brain barrier may not always be intact in brain tumors. Other factors, such as astrocytes, may contribute to the resistance of brain tumors to therapy using nanoparticles. Fat soluble molecules less than 400 daltons in mass can freely diffuse past the BBB through lipid mediated passive diffusion.

===Damage in injury and disease===
The blood–brain barrier may become damaged in certain neurological diseases, as indicated by neuroimaging studies of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, epilepsy, ischemic stroke, and brain trauma, and in systemic diseases, such as liver failure. Effects such as impaired glucose transport and endothelial degeneration may lead to metabolic dysfunction within the brain, and an increased permeability of the BBB to proinflammatory factors, potentially allowing antibiotics and phagocytes to move across the BBB. However, in many neurodegenerative diseases, the exact cause and pathology remains unknown. It is still unclear whether the BBB dysfunction in the disease is a causative agent, a result of the disease, or somewhere in the middle.

==History==
A 1898 study observed that low-concentration &quot;bile salts&quot; failed to affect behavior when injected into the blood of animals. Thus, in theory, the salts failed to enter the brain.

Two years later, Max Lewandowsky may have been the first to coin the term &quot;blood–brain barrier&quot; in 1900, referring to the hypothesized semipermeable membrane. There is some debate over the creation of the term &quot;blood–brain barrier&quot; as it is often attributed to Lewandowsky, but it does not appear in his papers. The creator of the term may have been Lina Stern. Stern was a Russian scientist who published her work in Russian and French. Due to the language barrier between her publications and English-speaking scientists, this could have made her work a lesser-known origin of the term.

All the while, bacteriologist Paul Ehrlich was studying staining, a procedure that is used in many microscopy studies to make fine biological structures visible using chemical dyes. As Ehrlich injected some of these dyes (notably the aniline dyes that were then widely used), the dye stained all of the organs of some kinds of animals except for their brains. At that time, Ehrlich attributed this lack of staining to the brain simply not picking up as much of the dye.

However, in a later experiment in 1913, Edwin Goldmann (one of Ehrlich&#x27;s students) injected the dye directly into the cerebrospinal fluid of animal brains. He found then the brains did become dyed, but the rest of the body did not, demonstrating the existence of a compartmentalization between the two. At that time, it was thought that the blood vessels themselves were responsible for the barrier, since no obvious membrane could be found.

<text>Bird-in-Hand is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, United States, in East Lampeter Township. The &quot;Bird in Hand&quot; ZIP code extends east from the CDP into Leacock and Upper Leacock townships. The community has a large Amish and Mennonite population. As of the 2010 census, the population within the CDP was 402.

== History ==
The area&#x27;s first inhabitants were Native American Shawnee and Susquehannock people.

The earliest European settlers of what was to become Bird-in-Hand were Quakers and Swiss Mennonites. James Smith was the first of the Quakers known to have settled in the area, arriving by the year 1715. William and Dorothy McNabb were pioneer landowners and the owners of the original Bird-in-Hand Hotel. The Quakers built a meetinghouse and two-story academy, which stands today, next to the present-day Bird-in-Hand fire company.
The community was founded in 1734. The legend of the naming of Bird-in-Hand concerns the time when the Old Philadelphia Pike was surveyed between Lancaster and Philadelphia. According to legend, two road surveyors discussed whether they should stay at their present location or go on to the town of Lancaster. One of them supposedly said, &quot;A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush,&quot; which means it is preferable to have a small but certain advantage than the mere potential of a greater one; and so they stayed. By 1734, road surveyors were making McNabb&#x27;s hotel their headquarters rather than returning to Lancaster every day. The sign in front of the inn is known to have once &quot;portrayed a man with a bird in his hand and a bush nearby, in which two birds were perched,&quot; and was known as the Bird-in-Hand Inn. Variations of this sign appear throughout the town today.

In 1834 construction began on the Pennsylvania Railroad line between Philadelphia and Columbia. Bird-in-Hand, featuring tanneries, feed mills, and coal and lumber yards, was the most important stop on the Lancaster-to-Coatesville section.

In 1836 the village post office was established as the Enterprise Post Office, as the village was then officially called, until the name officially changed to Bird-in-Hand in 1873.

The town remained relatively unknown until a musical called &quot;Plain and Fancy&quot; opened in New York in 1955. The play was set in the village of Bird-in-Hand and is often credited as a catalyst for the boom in Pennsylvania Dutch Country tourism in the mid-twentieth century. The Plain &amp; Fancy Restaurant opened in 1960 and is the oldest &quot;family-style restaurant&quot; in the area. Bird-in-Hand is often named in lists of &quot;delightfully-named towns&quot; in Pennsylvania Dutchland, along with Intercourse, Blue Ball, Lititz, Bareville, Mount Joy and Paradise.

In 1968 the Smucker family opened a small 30-room motel called the Bird-in-Hand Motor Inn, with an adjacent coffee shop, in hopes of capitalizing on the growing tourist trade in the area. Over the years, the small coffee shop grew into the larger Bird-in-Hand Family Restaurant &amp; Smorgasbord.

In 1976 the Bird-in-Hand Farmers Market opened adjacent to the Bird-in-Hand Motor Inn.

The Bird-in-Hand Village Inn and Suites was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.

The town is home to the Bank of Bird-in-Hand, the first bank in the United States to open following the passage of the Dodd Frank Act.

==Geography==
Bird-in-Hand is in central Lancaster County, on the eastern edge of East Lampeter Township. Pennsylvania Route 340 (Old Philadelphia Pike) runs through the center of town, leading west to Lancaster, the county seat, and east to Intercourse.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Bird-in-Hand CDP has a total area of , of which , or 1.11%, are water. The area drains westward to Mill Creek, a west-flowing tributary of the Conestoga River, part of the Susquehanna River watershed.

==Demographics==
== Economy ==
Tourism is very important and many businesses cater specifically to tourists. Many of these businesses have an Amish theme, such as horse and buggy rides and crafts.

<text>The Thirty-Nine Steps is a 1915 adventure novel by the Scottish author John Buchan, first published by William Blackwood and Sons, Edinburgh. It was serialized in &quot;All-Story Weekly&quot; issues of 5 and 12 June 1915, and in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; (credited to &quot;H. de V.&quot;) between July and September 1915, before being published in book form in October of that year. It is the first of five novels featuring Richard Hannay, an all-action hero with a stiff upper lip and a knack for getting himself out of tricky situations.

The novel has been adapted many times, including several films and a long-running stage play. In 2003, the book was listed on the BBC&#x27;s Big Read poll of Britain&#x27;s &quot;best-loved novels.&quot;

== Plot ==
The story&#x27;s narrator, Richard Hannay, arrives in London from Rhodesia early in 1914, having made a modest fortune as a mining engineer. Disillusioned with his uneventful life as a man about town, he is on the brink of resolving to leave England for good when a panicked neighbour, Franklin Scudder, knocks at the door of his flat in Portland Place. Scudder is a freelance journalist who claims to have uncovered a plot against the Premier of Greece, Constantine Karolides. According to Scudder, Karolides is to be assassinated in London in a few weeks&#x27; time, on 15 June, an event which the plotters hope will trigger war in Europe.

Fearing for his life, Scudder has gone to the trouble of faking his own death, and needs to disappear from view. Hannay permits him to hide in his flat, and is horrified when a few days later he returns to find Scudder with a knife through his heart, now truly dead. Determined to warn the government of the plot, but unwilling to go to the police for fear of being arrested for murder, Hannay escapes the building disguised as a milkman and takes a train to Scotland, intending to find a remote area where he can lie low. He takes with him the coded notebook in which Scudder had recorded his findings.

Hannay alights at a rural station in the Galloway Hills, and a cat-and-mouse chase ensues as he evades both the plotters, who attempt to spot him on the open hillside from an aeroplane, and the police. Deciphering Scudder&#x27;s notes, he learns that his adversaries are members of a German spy ring known as the &quot;Black Stone&quot; whose goal is to steal Britain&#x27;s naval defence plans before war breaks out. Hannay meets Sir Harry, landowner and local parliamentary candidate, and takes him into his confidence. Sir Harry promises to write to his godfather, Sir Walter Bullivant, Permanent Secretary at the Foreign Office, to warn him of the plot.

Narrowly avoiding his pursuers, Hannay stumbles into a lonely cottage and finds himself face to face with the Black Stone&#x27;s leader. Hannay&#x27;s lies are convincing enough to leave the spies in doubt as to his true identity, and they lock him in a storeroom rather than killing him outright. Finding a cabinet full of explosives, Hannay uses his experience as a mining engineer to escape by blowing the window from its frame. Eventually he manages to catch a train south, hoping to find Sir Walter Bullivant at his home in Berkshire.

Sir Walter accepts the bulk of Hannay&#x27;s story, but doubts that Karolides&#x27; life is in danger. An urgent government phone call, however, informs him that Karolides is already dead. The two men travel to London, where Sir Walter is to host a high-level official meeting at his city townhouse. Hannay, now cleared of the Portland Place murder, is left to his own devices, but a general feeling of unease prompts him to call at Sir Walter&#x27;s house. He arrives just in time to see the First Sea Lord leaving; their eyes briefly meet, and Hannay recognizes him as one of the spies in disguise. Hannay breaks into the meeting, but by the time the deception is confirmed the man has long gone, taking with him the naval secrets he has just learned. 

Realising that the spies will have to cross the Channel to get their information back to Germany, Hannay and the meeting attendees comb Scudder&#x27;s notebook for clues as to the planned point of departure. An entry reading &quot;Thirty-nine steps — I counted them — High tide, 10.17 p.m.&quot; leads them to a clifftop villa in Kent with a private flight of steps — 39 in total — running down to the sea. A yacht waits offshore. Hannay confronts the occupants of the villa and is mortified to find what appears to be a perfectly ordinary group of English friends who have been enjoying a game of tennis in the sun. But then one of the men droops his eyelids in a characteristic gesture that Hannay recognizes — it is the owner of the cottage in Scotland. Hannay blows his whistle, and the spies are arrested before they can reach the yacht. Britain enters the Great War seven weeks later, and Hannay is commissioned as a captain in the army. He comments, &quot;But I had done my best service, I think, before I put on khaki.&quot;

== Principal characters ==

* Richard Hannay – protagonist and narrator; mining engineer recently arrived from Southern Africa
* Franklin P Scudder – freelance journalist
* Sir Harry – Scottish landowner and local parliamentary candidate

* Alexander Turnbull – roadmender

== Background ==

John Buchan wrote &quot;The Thirty-Nine Steps&quot; while he was ill in bed with a duodenal ulcer, an illness which remained with him all his life. Buchan&#x27;s son William later wrote that the name of the book originated when the author&#x27;s daughter was counting the stairs at St Cuby, a private nursing home on Cliff Promenade in Broadstairs, where Buchan was convalescing. &quot;There was a wooden staircase leading down to the beach. My sister, who was about six, and who had just learnt to count properly, went down them and gleefully announced: there are 39 steps.&quot; The tunnelled stairway through the cliff actually consisted of 78 steps, but Buchan halved the number to make a better title. When the original oak steps were later replaced, one of them, complete with a brass plaque, was sent to Buchan. The concrete steps now number 108, still running from the garden to the beach.

This novel was his first &quot;shocker&quot;, as he called it — a story combining personal and political dramas. It marked a turning point in Buchan&#x27;s literary career and introduced his adventuring hero Richard Hannay. He described a &quot;shocker&quot; as an adventure where the events in the story are unlikely and the reader is only just able to believe that they really happened.

== Dedication ==
Buchan dedicated the novel to his friend Thomas Arthur Nelson, saying &quot;My Dear Tommy, / You and I have long cherished an affection for that elemental type of tale which Americans call the &#x27;dime novel&#x27; and which we know as the &#x27;shocker&#x27; — the romance where the incidents defy the probabilities, and march just inside the borders of the possible. During an illness last winter I exhausted my store of those aids to cheerfulness, and was driven to write one for myself. This little volume is the result, and I should like to put your name on it in memory of our long friendship, in the days when the wildest fictions are so much less improbable than the facts.

==Literary significance and criticism==
&quot;The Thirty-Nine Steps&quot; is one of the earliest examples of the &#x27;&quot;man-on-the-run&quot; thriller archetype subsequently adopted by film makers as a much-used plot device. In &quot;The Thirty-Nine Steps&quot;, Buchan holds up Richard Hannay as an example to his readers of an ordinary man who puts his country&#x27;s interests before his own safety. The story was a great success with the men in the First World War trenches. One soldier wrote to Buchan, &quot;The story is greatly appreciated in the midst of mud and rain and shells, and all that could make trench life depressing.&quot;

Hannay continued his adventures in four subsequent books. Two were set during the war, when he continued his undercover work against the Germans and their allies the Turks in &quot;Greenmantle&quot; (1916) and &quot;Mr Standfast&quot; (1919). The other two stories, &quot;The Three Hostages&quot; (1924) and &quot;The Island of Sheep&quot; (1936) were set in the postwar period, when Hannay&#x27;s opponents were criminal gangs.

==Adaptations==
The novel has been adapted for multiple media; many of these versions depart significantly from the text – for example, by introducing a love interest absent from the original novel and inspired by Hitchcock&#x27;s film. In most cases, the title is often abbreviated to &quot;The 39 Steps&quot;, but the full title is more commonly used for the book and 1978 film adaptation.

=== Film ===
==== &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; (1935) ====

The 1935 black-and-white film directed by Alfred Hitchcock deviates substantially from the book. It stars Robert Donat as Hannay and Madeleine Carroll as a woman he meets on the train. It is regarded by many critics as the best film version. This was one of several Hitchcock films based upon the idea of an &quot;innocent man on the run&quot;, such as &quot;Saboteur&quot; and &quot;North by Northwest&quot;. In 1999, it came 4th in a BFI poll of British films and in 2004 &quot;Total Film&quot; named it the 21st greatest British film of all time.

==== &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; (1959) ====

The 1959 film directed by Ralph Thomas was the first colour version, starring Kenneth More as Hannay and Taina Elg as Miss Fisher. It is closely based on Hitchcock&#x27;s adaptation, including the music-hall finale with &quot;Mr. Memory&quot; and Hannay&#x27;s escape from a train on the Forth Bridge, scenes not present in the book. It features a musical score by Clifton Parker.

==== &quot;The Thirty Nine Steps&quot; (1978) ====

The 1978 version was directed by Don Sharp and starred Robert Powell as Hannay, Karen Dotrice as Alex, John Mills as Colonel Scudder. It is generally regarded as the closest to the book, being set at the same time as the novel, pre-Great War, but still bears little resemblance to Buchan&#x27;s original story. Its climax bore no relation to the novel&#x27;s denouement, instead seeing Hannay hanging from the hands of Big Ben. The film was followed by a spin-off television series, &quot;Hannay&quot;, also starring Powell and featuring adventures occurring before the events in &quot;The Thirty-Nine Steps&quot;.

==== &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; (2008) ====

The BBC commissioned a new television adaptation of the novel, scripted by Lizzie Mickery and produced by BBC Scotland&#x27;s drama unit. The 90-minute film stars Rupert Penry-Jones, Lydia Leonard, Patrick Malahide and Eddie Marsan, and was first broadcast on 28 December 2008 A romantic subplot was added to the story, featuring Lydia Leonard. The storyline only very tenuously follows that of the book, many characters being renamed, or omitted altogether. The film ends with a scene involving a submarine in a Scottish loch, rather than the original setting off the Kent coast, and the apparent death of one character.

===Theatre===

A comic theatrical adaptation by Simon Corble and Nobby Dimon for a cast of four actors premiered in 1995 at the Georgian Theatre Royal in Richmond, North Yorkshire, before embarking on a tour of village halls across the north of England. In 2005, Patrick Barlow rewrote the script, keeping the scenes, staging and small-scale feel, and in June 2005 this re-adaptation premiered at the West Yorkshire Playhouse, The play then opened in London&#x27;s Tricycle Theatre, and after a successful run transferred to the Criterion Theatre in Piccadilly where it became the fifth longest running play until it closed in September 2015. Although drawing on Buchan&#x27;s novel, it is strongly influenced by Hitchcock&#x27;s 1935 film adaptation. On 15 January 2008, the show made its US Broadway premiere at the American Airlines Theatre; it transferred to the Cort Theatre on 29 April 2008 and then moved to the Helen Hayes Theatre on 21 January 2009, where it ended its run on 10 January 2010. It reopened on Stage One of New York&#x27;s Off-Broadway venue New World Stages on 25 March 2010 and closed on 15 April 2010. The Broadway production received six Tony Award nominations, winning two – Best Lighting Design and Best Sound Design – with the London show winning an Olivier in 2007 and two Tony Awards in 2008. The play also won the Drama Desk Award, Unique Theatrical Experience.

===Television===
A 1988 prequel television series named &quot;Hannay&quot; was spawned from the 1978 feature film version. 

&quot;The 39 Steps&quot; is a Netflix miniseries to be directed by Edward Berger

===Video game===
A 2013, Scottish developer &quot;The Story Mechanics&quot; used the Unity game engine to create &quot;The 39 Steps&quot;, a digital adaptation.

===Interactive fiction===
In 2008, Penguin Books adapted the story as interactive fiction under the authorship of Charles Cumming calling it &quot;The 21 Steps&quot;.

<text>A covered bridge is a timber-truss bridge with a roof, decking, and siding, which in most covered bridges create an almost complete enclosure. The purpose of the covering is to protect the wooden structural members from the weather. Uncovered wooden bridges typically have a lifespan of only 20 years because of the effects of rain and sun, but a covered bridge can last over 100 years. In the United States, only about 1 in 10 survived the 20th century. The relatively small number of surviving bridges is due to deliberate replacement, neglect, and the high cost of restoration.

Surviving covered bridges often attract touristic attention due to their rarity, quaint appearance, and bucolic settings. Many are considered historic and have been the subject of historic preservation campaigns.

== European and North American truss bridges ==
Typically, covered bridges are structures with longitudinal timber-trusses which form the bridge&#x27;s backbone. Some were built as railway bridges, using very heavy timbers and doubled up lattice work. 

In Canada and the U.S., numerous timber covered bridges were built in the late 1700s to the late 1800s, reminiscent of earlier designs in Germany and Switzerland. They tend to be in isolated places, making them vulnerable to vandalism and arson.

=== Europe ===
The oldest surviving truss bridge in the world is the Kapellbrücke in Switzerland, first built in the 1300s. Modern-style timber truss bridges were pioneered in Switzerland in the mid-1700s.
Germany has 70 surviving historic wooden covered bridges.
*The Holzbrücke Bad Säckingen spans the river Rhine from Bad Säckingen, Germany, to Stein, Switzerland. It was first built before 1272, and has been destroyed and rebuilt many times.
* Switzerland has many timber covered bridges, including Kapellbrücke, Spreuer Bridge, and Neubrügg.
* The Ponte Coperto in Pavia is a stone and brick arch bridge over the Ticino River in Pavia, Italy. The previous bridge, dating from 1354 (itself a replacement for a Roman construction), was heavily damaged by Allied action in 1945. A debate on whether to fix or replace the bridge ended when the bridge partially collapsed in 1947, requiring new construction, which began in 1949.

=== North America ===
Most bridges were built to cross streams, and the majority had just a single span. Virtually all contained a single lane. A few two-lane bridges were built, having a third, central truss.

Many different truss designs were used. One of the most popular designs was the Burr Truss, patented in 1817, which used an arch to bear the load, while the trusses kept the bridge rigid. Other designs included the King, Queen, Lattice, and Howe trusses.

Early trusses were designed with only a rough understanding of the engineering dynamics at work. In 1847, American engineer Squire Whipple published the first correct analysis of the precise ways that a load is carried through the components of a truss, which enabled him to design stronger bridges with fewer materials.

====United States====

About 14,000 covered bridges have been built in the United States, mostly in the years 1825 to 1875. The first documented was the &quot;Permanent Bridge&quot;, completed in 1805 to span the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia. However, most other early examples of covered bridges do not appear until the 1820s. Extant bridges from that decade include New York&#x27;s Hyde Hall Bridge and Pennsylvania&#x27;s Hassenplug Bridge, both built in 1825, and the Haverhill–Bath Covered Bridge and the Roberts Covered Bridge, in New Hampshire and Ohio respectively, both built in 1829.

The longest covered bridge ever built was constructed in 1814 in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and spanned over a mile in length, but was destroyed by ice and flooding in 1832. The longest, historical covered bridges remaining in the United States are the Cornish–Windsor Bridge, spanning the Connecticut River between New Hampshire and Vermont, and Medora Bridge, spanning the East Fork of the White River in Indiana. Both lay some claim to the superlative depending upon how the length is measured.

In the mid-19th century, the use of cheaper wrought iron and cast iron led to metal rather than timber trusses. Metal structures did not need protection from the elements, so they no longer needed to be covered. The bridges also became obsolete because most were single-lane, had low width and height clearances, and could not support the heavy loads of modern traffic.

, there were about 750 left, mostly in eastern and northern states. The 2021 World Guide to Covered Bridges lists 840 covered bridges in the U.S., although it states that only 670 of those were standing when the 1959 edition was published. The tallest (35 feet high), built in 1892, is the Felton Covered Bridge, just north of Santa Cruz, California.

==== Canada ====
Between 1969 and 2015, the number of surviving covered bridges in Canada declined from about 400 to under 200.

In 1900, Quebec had an estimated 1,000 covered bridges. Relative to the rest of North America, Quebec was late in building covered bridges, with the busiest decade for construction being the 1930s. Initially, the designs were varied, but around 1905, the design was standardised to the &quot;Town québécois&quot;, a variant on the lattice truss patented by Ithiel Town in 1820. The designer is unknown. About 500 of these were built in the first half of the 20th century. They were often built by local settlers using local materials, according to standard plans. The last agricultural colony was founded in 1948, and the last bridge was built by the Ministry of Colonisation in 1958 in Lebel-sur-Quévillon. There are now 82 covered bridges in Quebec, Transports Québec including the Félix-Gabriel-Marchand Bridge, the province&#x27;s longest covered bridge. In Quebec covered bridges were sometimes known as &quot;pont rouges&quot; (red bridges) because of their typical colour.

Like Quebec, New Brunswick continued to build covered bridges into the 1950s, peaking at about 400 covered bridges. These mostly used the Howe, Town, and Burr trusses. Today, there are 58 covered bridges in New Brunswick, including the world&#x27;s longest, the Hartland Bridge. 

Ontario has just one remaining covered bridge, the West Montrose Covered Bridge.

== Roofed bridges==

Roofed, rather than covered bridges, have existed for centuries in southern Europe and Asia. In these cases, the cover is to protect the users of the bridge rather than the structure. Examples include:
* The Pont de Rohan in Landerneau, France, and the Pont des Marchands in Narbonne are two of 45 inhabited bridges in Europe.
* A tubular bridge is a bridge built as a rigid box girder section within which the traffic is carried. Examples include the Britannia Bridge and the Conwy Railway Bridge in the United Kingdom.
* A skyway is a type of urban pedway consisting of an enclosed or covered footbridge between two buildings, designed to protect pedestrians from the weather. For example, the Bridge of Sighs in Cambridge, and Oxford&#x27;s Bridge of Sighs and Logic Lane covered bridge.
* A jet bridge is an enclosed, moveable bridge which extends from an airport terminal gate to an airplane, allowing passengers to board and disembark without having to go outside.
* Some stone arch bridges are covered to protect pedestrians or as a decoration—as with the Italian Ponte Coperto and Rialto Bridge, and the Chùa Cầu (the Japanese Bridge; see Gallery below) in Vietnam.
* In China &quot;lángqiáo&quot; () covered bridges are found in Guangxi, including the Chengyang Bridge and the Xijin Bridge. These are pier and girder bridges, not truss bridges. The Chùa Cầu bridge is found in Vietnam.
* In Europe there are also bridges built not strictly for transport, for example the Český Krumlov Castle Bridge in the Czech Republic, the Lovech Covered Bridge in Bulgaria, and the Ponte Vecchio in Italy.

== In fiction ==
In addition to being practical, covered bridges were popular venues for a variety of social activities and are an enduring cultural icon; for example:

* The 1992 novel, &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot;, featured the Cedar Covered Bridge, which has since been burnt by arson in 2002, replaced with a replica, and burnt by arson again in 2017.
* The Edgar Allan Poe story &quot;Never Bet the Devil Your Head&quot;
* Plot points in the 1988 comedy films &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; and &quot;Funny Farm&quot; refer to them.
* The Diehls Covered Bridge in Pennsylvania is featured in the opening scenes of the 1980s anthology horror television series &quot;Tales from the Darkside&quot;, created by George A. Romero.
*The Joe Hill novel &quot;NOS4A2&quot; features a character who uses a covered bridge called the &quot;Shorter Way&quot; as a portal to travel instantly across vast distances.
* A covered bridge is also used as a portal between two worlds in John Carpenter&#x27;s horror film &quot;In the Mouth of Madness&quot; (1994).
* A covered bridge is the focus of two mystery stories in the collection &quot;All But Impossible&quot; by Edward D. Hoch.

<text>In classical Latin, the epithet &quot;Indiges&quot;, singular in form, is applied to Sol (&quot;Sol Indiges&quot;) and to Jupiter of Lavinium, later identified with Aeneas. One theory holds that it means the &quot;speaker within&quot;, and stems from before the recognition of divine persons. Another, which the &quot;Oxford Classical Dictionary&quot; holds more likely, is that it means &quot;invoked&quot; in the sense of &quot;pointing at&quot;, as in the related word &quot;indigitamenta&quot;.

In Augustan literature, the &quot;di indigites&quot; are often associated with &quot;di patrii&quot; and appear in lists of local divinities (that is, divinities particular to a place). Servius noted that Praeneste had its own &quot;indigetes&quot;.

Evidence pertaining to &quot;di indigites&quot; is rarely found outside Rome and Lavinium, but a fragmentary inscription from Aletrium (modern Alatri, north of Frosinone) records offerings to &quot;di Indicites&quot; including Fucinus, a local lake-god; Summanus, a god of nocturnal lightning; Fiscellus, otherwise unknown, but perhaps a local mountain god; and the Tempestates, weather deities. This inscription has been interpreted as a list of local or nature deities to whom transhumant shepherds should make propitiary offers.

==Wissowa&#x27;s indigetes==
In Georg Wissowa&#x27;s terminology, the di indigetes or indigites were Roman deities that were not adopted from other religions, as distinguished from the &quot;di novensides&quot;. Wissowa thus regarded the &quot;indigetes&quot; as &quot;indigenous gods&quot;, and the &quot;novensides&quot; as &quot;newcomer gods&quot;. Ancient use, however, does not treat the two terms as a dichotomy, nor maintain a clear-cut distinction between &quot;indigetes&quot; and &quot;novensides&quot;. Wissowa&#x27;s interpretation is no longer widely accepted and the meaning remains uncertain.

Wissowa listed 33 &quot;di indigetes&quot;, including two collectives in the plural, the Lares of the estate and the Lemures of the dead. Any list of &quot;indigetes&quot;, however, is conjectural; Raimo Anttila points out that &quot;we do not know the list of the &quot;di indigetes&quot;.&quot;

==Ancient sources==
Carl Koch compiled a list of Latin authors and inscriptions using the phrase &quot;di indigetes&quot; or &quot;Indiges&quot;:

* Livy, 1.2.6, on the end of the mortal life of Aeneas on the river Numicus and his identification with or assimilation to &quot;Iovem Indigetem&quot; in that place.
* Livy, 8.9.6, the formula of the &quot;devotio&quot; of Decius Mus
* &quot;CIL&quot; I Elog. I from Pompeii: &quot;... apellatusque est Indige(n)s Pater et in deorum numero relatus&quot;.
* Vergil, &quot;Aeneid&quot; 12.794, as an epithet of Aeneas
* Pliny, &quot;Natural History&quot; 3.56, as an epithet of Sol
* &quot;CIL&quot; 10.5779 from Sora, &quot;Iovi Airsii Dis Indigetibus cum aedicl(a) et base [et ae]di? et porticu&quot;.

* Silius Italicus, &quot;Punica&quot; 9.278, &quot;Di Indigetes Faunusque satorque Quirinus&quot;; also 10.435 ff.
* Lucan, &quot;Pharsalia&quot; 1.556, mentions the &quot;di indigetes&quot; along with the Lares.
* Claudian, &quot;Bellum Gildonicum&quot; 1.131

==Scholarship on the &quot;di indigetes&quot;==

C. Koch, A. Grenier, H. J. Rose, Hendrik Wagenvoort, E. Vetter, K. Latte, G. Radke, R. Schilling, and more recently, R. Anttila have made contributions to the enquiry into the meaning of the word &quot;Indiges&quot; and on the original nature of the &quot;di indigetes&quot;.

===Koch===
Carl Koch&#x27;s analysis is particularly complete, and centers mainly on the question of &quot;Sol Indiges&quot;: Koch has argued that &quot;Sol Indiges&quot; is the god to which the &quot;Agonium&quot; of December 11 is devoted. Koch remarks too that the festival of December 11 is in correspondence with the &quot;Matralia&quot; of June 11, dedicated to Mater Matuta, considered the goddess of dawn and, in the ritual, the aunt of the sun, who is the son of the night. Koch was the first to advance the hypothesis of the &quot;Sol Indiges&quot; as the forefather (&quot;Stammvater&quot;) of the Roman nation.

===Grenier===
Albert Grenier contributed a paper in which he expands on the results obtained by Koch and pays more attention to the original nature of the &quot;di Indigetes&quot;. He acknowledges similar conclusions have been reached by Hendrik Wagenvoort.

As Koch did, Grenier cites the formula of the oath of loyalty to M. Livius Drusus in 91 BCE by a Latin chief, preserved by Diodorus Siculus, in which are mentioned, after Iuppiter Capitolinus, Vesta, and Mars Pater, &quot;Helios genarchees&quot;, and &quot;euergetin zooin te kai phytoon Geen&quot; (‘&quot;the mother Earth which benefits animals and plants&quot;’). Grenier thinks that &quot;Sol Indiges&quot; and the &quot;Good Mother Earth&quot; (whom he interprets to be the &quot;Mater Matuta&quot; of the &quot;Matralia&quot;) would be the &quot;di Indigetes&quot; of the &quot;devotio&quot; of Decius Mus.

He goes on to analyse the other testimonies related to the cult of the &quot;di indigetes&quot; found in Dionysius of Halicarnassus.

The first is the inscription on the monument on the Numicus, which was thought to be dedicated to &quot;Aeneas Iuppiter Indiges,&quot; which reads: &quot;Of the Father God chthonios who rules the flow of the Numicius.&quot; Grenier remarks that the inscription does not mention Aeneas, and is in fact just a small sanctuary of the god of the river. In this same region, Pliny (see prev. section) mentions a &quot;Sol Indiges,&quot; and Dionysius describes a monument called the &quot;Sanctuary of the Sun&quot; in his time, made up by two altars on an East–West line by a marsh: It was believed to have been erected by Aeneas as a token of thanksgiving for the miracle of the spring. On this evidence, Grenier concludes that &quot;Sol Indiges&quot; is connected to Lavinium and to the cult of the &quot;Penates publici&quot; of Rome. This fact is supported by Varro: &quot;Lavinium ibi dii penates nostri&quot;. This identification is further supported by the tradition that the new consuls, upon entering office, sacrificed on this &quot;sanctuary of the Sun&quot; to Iuppiter Indiges and by the fact that the formulae of the oaths never mention the &quot;di indigetes&quot; along with &quot;Iuppiter&quot;.

Grenier concludes from such evidence that the &quot;Penates&quot; were included within the &quot;indigetes&quot;. The Roman &quot;Penates publici&quot; were represented as two young men or boys, similar to the Dioscures, and identified as gods brought by Aeneas from Troy, as the true identity of the Indigetes was secret to avoid exauguration.

Grenier considers the identification with Aeneas and Romulus a later development, and thinks the original &quot;indigetes&quot; were naturalistic gods: forces like the sun, the earth, and the waters, which make the wheat and the children grow. Finally, he concludes that they should have been the &quot;turba deorum&quot; of the &quot;indigitamenta,&quot; which expressed the animistic nature of the most ancient Roman religion.

===Latte===
Kurt Latte has supported Carl Koch&#x27;s thesis that the most ancient Roman religious concepts were based on the natural forces of the sun, moon and waters. He cites and quotes the invocations to the goddess of the Moon at the beginning of every month by the &quot;pontifex minor&quot;, who repeated for five or seven times the invocation: &quot;&quot;Dies te quinque calo Iuno Covella&quot; or when the Nonae were on the seventh day: &quot;Septem dies te calo Iuno Covella&quot;. The invocation to the god of the Tiber during the summer drought: &quot;Adesto Tiberine, cum tuis undis&quot;&quot;. Latte supposes that these invocations were justified by a faith in the magic power of words. &quot;Pater Indiges&quot; is attested by Solinus (II 15) as referred to Aeneas after his disappearance on the Numicius and Dionysius also makes reference to the Numicius. Latte thinks that it must be the same cult and the question is whether in Augustan times, the original &quot;Pater Indiges&quot; was transformed into &quot;Iuppiter Indiges&quot;. Whereas Dionysius&#x27;s text may imply the latter interpretation to be the right one, Latte thinks the material is insufficient to decide.

The other occurrence of &quot;indiges&quot; in the singular is that of &quot;Sol Indiges,&quot; of which two festivals are known as well as the location of his cult on the Quirinal (from the Fasti) one of which is the &quot;[ag]ON IND[igeti]&quot;. Latte argues that the date of this latter festival does not correspond with the yearly course of the sun, but could perhaps be the day on which sowing should be completed, citing Columella, thus the sacrifice should refer to the power of the sun on vegetation.

Latte concludes that, by putting all the above elements together, it could be argued that &quot;indiges&quot; might be traced to a representation in which man requests the god to ensure the safety of his sowing. As &quot;Numicus&quot; has its parallel with &quot;Tiber&quot;, so &quot;Sol&quot; has its own parallel in the goddess of the Moon. The naive faith in the influence of celestial bodies has countless parallels, even in Athens.

Latte goes on to say that besides these two, there are only instances in the plural which were already not understood by Varro&#x27;s times. The poets of the Augustan era were without any clear idea of its original meaning, having only a vague idea that &quot;indiges&quot; was an archaism that had a strong ancient Roman flavor when calling on the gods.

Latte refutes Wissowa&#x27;s assertion that it was a central concept in Roman theology, also on the grounds of its irrelevance in the Roman calendar, which reflects the most ancient known historical religious document. The inscription from Sora, dating to 4 BCE, could be the issue of Augustan restoration and not proof of an original &quot;Iuppiter indiges&quot;. Another inscription from Ardea mentions &quot;novem deivo&quot; and the context clearly does not allow the interpretation of &quot;newly imported&quot;, disproving Wissowa&#x27;s assumption.

Latte has also inquired into the etymology of the word &quot;indiges&quot;. He recalls the attempt by Krestchmer to explain it with &quot;digitus&quot; (finger) which is problematic. In Rome, one did not use fingers when invoking the gods, and in the common original exit of the ancient singular. The most ancient connection with &quot;ag-ye&quot;, &quot;aio&quot; by Corssen is based on &quot;indigitare&quot; (frequentative as &quot;agitare&quot; for &quot;agere&quot;). However, more recent discussions have called this interpretation into question, as such formations are usually found only for monosyllabic verbal themes showing a vocalic shift with a preverbal, such as &quot;comes&quot;, &quot;superstes&quot;, &quot;trames&quot;, which &quot;aio&quot; excludes; moreover they have an active meaning in Latin. In addition, the hypothesis of a retrograde formation from &quot;indigitare&quot; has both linguistic and semantic difficulties: the construction with &quot;agere,&quot; meaning &quot;rendering oneself present,&quot; implies an impossible formation from a consonantic shift and the semantics of this translation is highly unlikely for ancient times.

Another relevant remark by Latte concerns the belief in the efficacy of the divine appellates, which are sometimes the same for different gods like &quot;Heries Iunonis&quot; and &quot;Heres Martea&quot;. The Iguvine Tablets mention a &quot;ahtu iuvio&quot; and a &quot;ahtu marti,&quot; interpreted as &quot;Actui Iovio&quot; and &quot;Actui Martio,&quot; to which sacrifices are offered. Latte remarks that here, the offer is made to the abstract concept of the virtue or power of the god, and not to the god himself. Other gods had special entities representing their power as in Rome, including &quot;Salacia Neptuni&quot; and &quot;Lua Saturni&quot;.

Latte finally refuses the interpretation &quot;indigetes divi&quot; for Greek &quot;daimones&quot; found in the translation by Macrobius of Hesiod &quot;Opera&quot; 121, considering it influenced by late time speculations. The connection of the Gentilician cult of the sun of the Aurelii with that of &quot;Sol Indiges&quot; is impossible to prove.

===Anttila===
Most recently, glottologist Raimo Anttila has made renewed attempts into the inquiry of the original meaning of the word &quot;indiges&quot; in his book on protoindoeuropean root *ag.

Anttila thinks that all the etymological and formal impasses mentioned by Latte could be overcome, if one interprets the basis of the word &quot;indiges&quot; to be the verb &quot;ago&quot; in the sense of to impel, to drive, to drive from within (&quot;*endo agentes&quot;), instead of the verb &quot;aio&quot; (I say). The action of the gods would be that of driving man just as man drives cattle e.g. also in sacrifice (agonium, etymology already cited by Ovid in his &quot;Fasti&quot; I 319 ff).

Anttila bases his analysis on the results of Latte, Radke, Schilling, and Ancellotti and Cerri. He agrees with Schilling&#x27;s view that the concept underwent changes and its original meaning should be kept different from its later history. Anttila starts considering the coincidence of &quot;Indiges&quot; with an &quot;Agonium&quot; on December 11 and its concurrence with the festival of &quot;Mater Matuta&quot; on June 11. He thinks there is sufficient evidence to say that it has to do with a solar cult centered on Lavinium, connecting the sun with water and earth. &quot;Sol Indiges&quot; is &quot;Pater Indiges&quot;, &quot;divus pater,&quot; i.e. &quot;Iuppiter Indiges&quot;, the highest divine power, the one which makes nature produce food. This impelling action seems close to &quot;Aja Ekapad&quot; and Savitr as variant terms for the sun in connection with other natural phenomena.

A similar tint is in Indra as Samaja gathering booty, the warrior aspect of economy. It is noteworthy that AGON IND repeat the same root *ag. The Italic evidence for sacrificial and divine power under *ag is plentiful. Umbrian divinities of action, &quot;ahtu&quot;, dative singular (from *ag-t-eu) are part of the sacrificial actions of Iuppiter and Mars, whereas with Cerfe, the growth action (genitive singular of *ker-s-o-) is assigned to the other gods, e.g. Cerfus Martius &#x27;the principle of vegetative growth in the sphere of Mars&#x27; the equivalent of Ares Aphneios in Arcadia. The god of creation Brahman is called ajana, i.e. driver, instigator. It is a general human religious concept that men drive animals and god drives men. Since &quot;Indiges&quot; as driver-in makes sense, from this would also stem the meaning of &quot;indigitare&quot;, &quot;indigitamenta&quot;. Carrying out a ritual action results in driving, here &quot;agere&quot; and &quot;agonalis&quot;.

On the basis of this big picture, Anttila attempts to draw a more precise conclusion and overcome the remaining formal difficulties. He argues that holding to the old interpretation of &quot;indiges&quot; as &#x27;the caller (forth)&#x27; and interpreting the uncertain Umbrian consonant-stem dative plural &quot;acetus&quot; &#x27;to the callers forth&#x27; as Ancellotti and Cerri do is doubtful and the etymology would be better represented by an *ag- drive than by an *ag-ye say, as the supposed root *kei/*ki is a moving root too and not a calling root. Radke has also proposed the possibility of *en-dhigh-et- grade 0 as in &quot;figulus&quot; (from IE stem DHEIG) as a nomen agentis meaning &#x27;forming, shaping, generating from within&#x27;, close to impelling.

To support his analysis, Anttila cites a medical term &quot;indigo/indigere&quot; meaning to drive bodily fluids, which is not attested in ancient texts. A hard tumor (scirosis) ″&quot;fit ex glutinoso et spisso humore quod confluendo ita membris indigitur ut insitus locis ubi considerit unum esse videatur&quot;″: the tumor is formed by humours that run together to a certain location by pushing the limbs from the inside so that it looks like one thing with the limb where they set. So tumors are pushed in as tubers and plants. Although the lexicographic evidence is flimsy, Anttila thinks it is important, owing to the close relation between medicine and religion. &quot;Indiges, indigere&quot; would hint to something coming out and bringing forth an end result (pushing into a state). To drive in results in something coming out. The richness of nature deities or their epithets (ahtu) brings about the beneficial result of life / food. The coordinator would be &quot;Iuppiter Indiges&quot;, the Impeller corresponding to &quot;Zeus Ageetoor&quot; at Sparta.

Finally, Anttila considers the worst formal difficulty left, that of the suffix -et- and its vowel not rising in indigetes, as remarked by Radke. Similar formations are merges/mergitis (sheaf), ales/alitis (winged), mansues/mansuetis (tame), seges/segetis (cornfield, harvest, produce), two of which pertain to the growing and reaping domain; Anttila thinks that in archaic religious language, peculiar forms are often preserved. &quot;Indigitare&quot; evoking gods would be to drive them in for our needs and &quot;Sol Indiges&quot; would be the force that drives all of nature, particularly food. Radke, and Ancellotti and Cerri, interpret the -t- form as a kind of active participle or agent noun and this would be the only possibility. Latte too gives as a background for &quot;indiges&quot; the general appeal to natural forces in Roman religion, e.g. the summoning of the Moon goddess and other instances.

==Archeological finds==
In 1958, an inscription was uncovered in Lavinium dating to the 3rd century BCE, reading &quot;Lare Aineia.&quot; In 1971, a temple built over a princely cenotaph in the Oriental style of the 7th century BCE was also discovered, probably on the site of a &quot;heroon&quot; described by Dionysius Halicarnassus. This would support an ancient assimilation of Aeneas to &quot;Indiges Pater&quot;.

<doc id="84948" wikidata="Q77338" url="?curid=84948" title="Matthias Claudius">
<text>Matthias Claudius (15 August 1740 – 21 January 1815) was a German poet and journalist, otherwise known by the pen name of &quot;Asmus&quot;.

==Life==
Claudius was born at Reinfeld, near Lübeck, and studied at Jena. He spent the greater part of his life in the town of Wandsbeck, where he earned his first literary reputation by editing from 1771 to 1775, a newspaper called &quot;Der Wandsbecker Bote&quot; (The Wandsbeck Messenger) (&quot;Wandsbeck&quot; until the year 1879 still written with &quot;ck&quot;. Today only with &quot;k&quot;.), in which he published a large number of prose essays and poems. They were written in pure and simple German, and appealed to the popular taste; in many there was a vein of extravagant humour or even burlesque, while others were full of quiet meditation and solemn sentiment. In his later days, perhaps through the influence of Klopstock, with whom he had formed an intimate acquaintance, Claudius became strongly pietistic, and the graver side of his nature showed itself. In 1814 he moved to Hamburg, to the house of his son-in-law, the publisher Friedrich Christoph Perthes, where he died on 21 January 1815.

==Work==
Claudius&#x27;s poem &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot; was used by composer Franz Schubert in 1817 for one of his most celebrated songs, which in turn became the basis for the 1824 string quartet of the same name.

Claudius&#x27;s collected works were published under the title of &quot;Asmus omnia sua secum portans, oder Sämtliche Werke des Wandsbecker Boten&quot; (8 vols., 1775–1812; 13th edition, by C. Redich, 2 vols., 1902). His biography has been written by Wilhelm Herbst (4th ed., 1878). See also M. Schneidereit, &quot;M. Claudius, seine Weltanschauung und Lebensweisheit&quot; (1898).

<doc id="84949" wikidata="Q4873552" url="?curid=84949" title="Baumgardener's Covered Bridge">
<text>The Baumgardener&#x27;s Covered Bridge is a covered bridge that spans Pequea Creek in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, United States. A county-owned and maintained bridge, its official designation is the Pequea #10 Bridge.
Note: The mill was constructed in 1800.

The bridge has a single span, wooden, double Burr arch trusses design with the addition of steel hanger rods. The deck is made from oak planks. It is painted red, the traditional color of Lancaster County covered bridges, on both the inside and outside. Both approaches to the bridge are painted in the traditional white color.

The bridge is located approximately north of Frogtown Road on Covered Bridge Road just to the east of Pennsylvania Route 324 in Martic Township. The bridge&#x27;s WGCB Number is 38-36-25. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 11, 1980.

== History ==
The Baumgardener&#x27;s Covered Bridge was built in 1860 by Davis Kitch at a cost of $1,284. In 1987 the bridge was restored after it was damaged in a flood the previous year. During this restoration process, which cost $200,000, the bridge was raised by and lengthened by to protect it from damage in potential future flooding.

<doc id="84950" wikidata="Q3331099" url="?curid=84950" title="Francis Bellamy">
<text>Francis Julius Bellamy (May 18, 1855 – August 28, 1931) was an American Christian socialist Baptist minister and author. He is best known for writing the original version of the Pledge of Allegiance in 1892.

==Early life==
Francis Julius Bellamy was born on May 18, 1855, in Mount Morris, New York to Rev. David Bellamy (1806–1864) and Lucy Clark. His family was deeply involved in the Baptist church and both Francis and his father became ministers. The family moved to Rome, New York, when Francis was only 5. Here, Bellamy became an active member of the First Baptist Church where his father served as minister until his death in 1864. Francis went on to attend the University of Rochester in Rochester, New York, where he studied theology and belonged to the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity.

He became a Baptist minister as a young man. He was very much influenced by the vestiges of the Second Great Awakening. He travelled to promote his Baptist faith and lived to be of service to others in his community. Bellamy&#x27;s travels brought him to Massachusetts where he penned the &quot;Pledge of Allegiance&quot; for a campaign by the &quot;Youth&#x27;s Companion&quot;, a patriotic circular and magazine. Bellamy &quot;believed in the absolute separation of church and state&quot; and purposefully did not include the phrase &quot;under God&quot; in his pledge.

==Pledge of Allegiance==
In 1891, Daniel Sharp Ford, the owner of the &quot;Youth&#x27;s Companion&quot;, hired Bellamy to work with Ford&#x27;s nephew James B. Upham in the magazine&#x27;s premium department. In 1888, the &quot;Youth&#x27;s Companion&quot; had begun a campaign to sell US flags to public schools as a premium to solicit subscriptions. For Upham and Bellamy, the flag promotion was more than merely a business move; under their influence, the &quot;Youth&#x27;s Companion&quot; became a fervent supporter of the schoolhouse flag movement, which aimed to place a flag above every school in the nation. Four years later, by 1892, the magazine had sold US flags to approximately 26,000 schools. By this time the market was slowing for flags but was not yet saturated.

In 1892, Upham had the idea of using the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus reaching the Americas / Western Hemisphere in 1492 to further bolster the schoolhouse flag movement. The magazine called for a national Columbian Public School Celebration to coincide with the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition, then scheduled to be held in Chicago, Illinois, during 1893. A flag salute was to be part of the official program for the Columbus Day celebration on October 12 to be held in schools all over the US.

The pledge was published in the September 8, 1892, issue of the magazine, and immediately put to use in the campaign. Bellamy went to speak to a national meeting of school superintendents to promote the celebration; the convention liked the idea and selected a committee of leading educators to implement the program, including the immediate past president of the National Education Association. Bellamy was selected as the chair. Having received the official blessing of educators, Bellamy&#x27;s committee now had the task of spreading the word across the nation and of designing an official program for schools to follow on the day of national celebration. He structured the program around a flag-raising ceremony and his pledge.

His original Pledge read as follows:
The recital was accompanied with a salute to the flag known as the Bellamy salute, described in detail by Bellamy. During World War II, the salute was replaced with a hand-over-heart gesture because the original form involved stretching the arm out towards the flag in a manner that resembled the later Nazi salute. (&quot;For a history of the pledge, see Pledge of Allegiance&quot;).

In 1954, in response to the perceived threat of secular Communism, President Eisenhower encouraged Congress to add the words &quot;under God,&quot; creating the 31-word pledge that is recited today.

Bellamy described his thoughts as he crafted the language of the pledge:
Bellamy &quot;viewed his Pledge as an &#x27;inoculation&#x27; that would protect immigrants and native-born but insufficiently patriotic Americans from the &#x27;virus&#x27; of radicalism and subversion.&quot;

In February 2022, Barry Popik tweeted a May 1892 newspaper report from Hays, Kansas, of a school flag-raising on 30 April accompanied by an almost identical pledge. An alternative theory is that the pledge was submitted to an 1890 patriotic competition in &quot;The Youth&#x27;s Companion&quot; by a 13-year-old Kansas schoolboy, coincidentally named Frank E. Bellamy. Based on the inconsistency of the facts, some favor Frank E. Bellamy rather than Francis Bellamy as the originator.

==Political views==
Bellamy was a Christian socialist, who &quot;championed &#x27;the rights of working people and the equal distribution of economic resources, which he believed was inherent in the teachings of Jesus.&#x27;&quot; In 1891, Bellamy was &quot;forced from his Boston pulpit for preaching against the evils of capitalism&quot;, and eventually stopped attending church altogether after moving to Florida, reportedly because of the racism he witnessed there. Francis&#x27;s career as a preacher ended because of his tendency to describe Jesus as a socialist. In the 21st century, Bellamy is considered an early American democratic socialist.

Bellamy was a leader in the public education movement, the nationalization movement, and the Christian socialist movement. He united his grassroots network to start a collective memory activism in 1892.

French philosopher Henri de Saint-Simon&#x27;s &quot;new Christianity&quot;, which stressed using science to tackle poverty, influenced Bellamy and many of the &quot;new St. Simonians.&quot; They saw nationalization (de-privatization) and public education as the policy solutions.

In 1889, Bellamy served as founding vice president and wrote several articles for the Society of Christian Socialists, a grassroots organization founded in Boston. The newspaper &quot;Dawn&quot; was run by his cousin Edward and Frances Willard. Francis Bellamy wrote about the Golden Rule and quoted Bible passages that denounced greed and lust for money. He was also chairman of the education committee.

Bellamy offered public education classes with topics such as &quot;Jesus the socialist&quot;, &quot;What is Christian Socialism?&quot;, and &quot;Socialism versus anarchy&quot;. In 1891, Bellamy was asked to write down this last lecture, which called for a strong government and argued that only the socialist economy could allow both the worker and the owner to practice the golden rule. This essay, along with public relations experience, allowed him to coordinate a massive Columbus Day campaign.

On immigration and universal suffrage, Bellamy wrote in the editorial of &quot;The Illustrated American&quot;, Vol. XXII, No. 394, p. 258: &quot;[a] democracy like ours cannot afford to throw itself open to the world where every man is a lawmaker, every dull-witted or fanatical immigrant admitted to our citizenship is a bane to the commonwealth.” And further: &quot;Where all classes of society merge insensibly into one another every alien immigrant of inferior race may bring corruption to the stock. There are races more or less akin to our own whom we may admit freely and get nothing but advantage by the infusion of their wholesome blood. But there are other races, which we cannot assimilate without lowering our racial standard, which should be as sacred to us as the sanctity of our homes.&quot;

==Later life and death==
Bellamy is known to have spent 19 years working in New York City but it is unclear as to when. While living there he would work in the advertising industry. He believed in high pressure advertising and thought that it could also still be truthful at the same time. Advertising was seen by him as a way to create demand for American industrial activities.

Bellamy and his second wife, Marie, moved from New York City to Tampa, Florida in 1922 where he spent the remainder of his life. Starting in 1926 he began to work part time for the Tampa Electric Company as advertising manager after persuading the company&#x27;s management that they needed systemic publicity/advertising he could develop. The 1930 United States Census recorded him residing at 2926 Wallcraft Avenue. He got fired from his job at Tampa Electric Company on July 15, 1931, and applied for and got a similar job at Tampa Gas Company.

Bellamy died in Tampa on August 28, 1931, at the age of 76. His cremated remains were brought back to New York and buried in a family plot in a cemetery in Rome, New York.

==Personal life==
Bellamy married Harriet Benton in Newark, New York, in 1881. They had three sons: John, who lived in California; David, who lived in Rochester, New York; and Brewster, who died as an infant. His first wife died in 1918, and he married Marie Morin (1920). His daughter-in-law Rachael (David&#x27;s wife) lived in Rochester until February/March 1989 when she died at the age of 93. David and Rachael had two children, David Jr. and Peter (1929-2021). His son, John Benton Bellamy, married Ruth &quot;Polly&quot; (née Edwards). They had three children, Harriet (1911–1999), Barbara (1913–2005) and John Benton Bellamy, Jr. (1921–2015).

Bellamy was the cousin of Edward Bellamy most famous for the utopian novel &quot;Looking Backward&quot;, which inspired the formation of Nationalist Clubs that similarly advocated a certain kind of Christian Socialism.

<text>The Bitzer&#x27;s Mill Covered Bridge is a covered bridge that spans the Conestoga River in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is the oldest bridge in the county still in use. A county-owned and maintained bridge, its official designation is the Big Conestoga #2 Bridge. The bridge is also called Martin&#x27;s Mill Bridge, Eberly&#x27;s Cider Mill Covered Bridge, and Fiand&#x27;s/Fiantz&#x27;s Covered Bridge.

The bridge has a single span, wooden, double Burr arch trusses design with the addition of steel hanger rods. The deck is made from oak planks. Added later, secondary steel I-beams support the bridge from underneath. The bridge is painted red on the outside, the traditional color of Lancaster County covered bridges. The inside of the bridge is not painted. Both approaches to the bridge are painted in the traditional white color. As of July 2006, the bridge has some damage to its sides including some missing or broken panels.

The bridge, which has a 10 foot 6 inch height restriction, was damaged again on November 20, 2023, this time by a 13 feet 4 inches tall semi-trailer which got stuck in the bridge and allegedly caused further damage by attempting to back out after being stuck.

The bridge&#x27;s WGCB Number is 38-36-04. In 1980 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places as structure number 80003516. It is located at (40.1405, -76.1520) near the junction of U.S. Route 222 and U.S. Route 322 southeast of Ephrata in West Earl Township. The bridge can be reached by going approximately south from U.S. Route 322 on Cabin Drive which becomes Conestoga Creek Road. A left onto Cider Mill Road leads straight to the bridge, which is visible from the intersection.

== History ==
The bridge was built in 1846 by George Fink and Sam Reamsnyder at a cost of $1,115. They used a single span, wooden, double Burr arch truss construction. At some point later, steel I-beams were installed under the floor to add support to the oldest bridge in Lancaster County. The bridge has historically been referred to by a number of names that reflected the various mill owners. In 1962, it was proposed to replace the bridge with a concrete span, but the plan was discontinued after much public outcry.

<doc id="84952" wikidata="Q560421" url="?curid=84952" title="Marvelous Marvin Hagler">
<text>Marvelous Marvin Hagler (born Marvin Nathaniel Hagler; May 23, 1954 – March 13, 2021) was an American professional boxer. He competed in boxing from 1973 to 1987 and reigned as the undisputed champion of the middleweight division from 1980 to 1987, making twelve successful title defenses, all but one by knockout. Hagler also holds the highest knockout percentage of all undisputed middleweight champions at 78 percent. His undisputed middleweight championship reign of six years and seven months is the second-longest active reign of the 20th century. He holds the record for the sixth longest reign as champion in middleweight history. Nicknamed &quot;Marvelous&quot; and annoyed that network announcers often did not refer to him as such, Hagler legally changed his name to &quot;Marvelous Marvin Hagler&quot; in 1982.

Hagler is an inductee of the International Boxing Hall of Fame and the World Boxing Hall of Fame. He was twice named Fighter of the Year by &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine and the Boxing Writers Association of America, as well as Fighter of the Decade (1980s) by &quot;Boxing Illustrated&quot; magazine. In 2001 and 2004, &quot;The Ring&quot; named him the fourth greatest middleweight of all time and in 2002 named him the 17th greatest fighter of the past 69 years. The International Boxing Research Organization rates Hagler as the sixth greatest middleweight of all time, while BoxRec rates him the 29th greatest boxer of all time, pound for pound. Many analysts and boxing writers consider Hagler to have one of the most durable chins in boxing history, having been knocked down only once during his entire professional career. The lone knockdown, scored by Juan Roldán of Argentina, was debatable.

==Early life, family and education==

Hagler was the first child of Robert Sims and Ida Mae Hagler, born on May 23, 1954. His birth year publicly came to light in 1982, when he had to state his date of birth in order to legally change from Marvin Nathaniel Hagler to Marvelous Marvin Hagler. Hagler was raised by his mother in the Central Ward of Newark, New Jersey, United States along with five siblings: sisters Veronica, Cheryl, Genarra, and Noreen, and half brother Robbie Sims, who, like Hagler, would also become a professional boxer. Hagler first put on gloves at the age of ten, for a social worker he knew only as Mister Joe, who taught him sports and got him involved in counseling other children. Hagler dropped out of school at the age of 14 and worked in a toy factory to help support the family. Ida Mae recalled her eldest son had always wanted to box and promised one day to buy her a home. Growing up, Hagler would pretend he was Floyd Patterson or Emile Griffith.

Following the riots of 1967 in which 26 people were killed and $11 million in property damage was caused, including the destruction of the Haglers&#x27; tenement, his family moved to Brockton, Massachusetts. Hagler said that looking down on the streets at the looters was almost like watching ants on a picnic table. Ida Mae described the riots as &quot;really terrifying&quot; and nobody left the Hagler apartment for three days. The family lay under Veronica&#x27;s bed during this time, with a pair of bullets smashing through the bedroom window, and shattering the plaster above the bed. Hagler and his siblings were forbidden from standing up by Ida Mae, who told her children to &quot;stay away from the windows.&quot; The family crawled about the five-room apartment, sliding around on cushions to reach the bathroom and kitchen. Once the riot was over, the nearby neighborhoods were mostly in ruin, and many cars had been stripped for parts. After another riot nearly two years later, Hagler and his family got out of Newark and moved to Brockton, Massachusetts.

==Amateur career==
In 1969, Hagler began boxing after being in a street fight with a local boxer called Dornell Wigfall (Wigfall accosted Hagler at a party and took him outside)—whom he later defeated twice on official fights—with his friends watching, and Wigfall easily beat Hagler and compounded the humiliation by stealing the jacket off Hagler&#x27;s back. The day after the fight, Hagler determined to become a boxer himself. He first entered Vinnie Vecchione&#x27;s gym (where, unknown to him, Dornell Wigfall trained), but after one week watching, and of nobody speaking to him, Hagler decided to leave for good. He walked into a gym owned by brothers Pat and Goody Petronelli. They became his trainers and managers. As Hagler needed to be 16 in order to enter some amateur tournaments, he lied about his age, saying that he was born in 1952 instead of 1954. In May 1973, Hagler won the National Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) title after defeating Terry Dobbs, a U.S. Marine from Atlanta, Georgia. Ahead of both Aaron Pryor and Leon Spinks, officials also voted him the &#x27;Outstanding Boxer&#x27; of the tournament. Hagler subsequently turned professional, finishing his amateur career with a 55–1 record.

==Professional career==
===Early career===
Hagler was a top-ranked middleweight boxer for many years before he fought for the title. He struggled to find high-profile opponents willing to face him in his early years. Joe Frazier told Hagler, &quot;You have three strikes against you, &quot;You&#x27;re black, you&#x27;re a southpaw, and you&#x27;re good.&quot; He often had to travel to his opponents&#x27; hometowns to get fights. His first break came when he was offered—on two weeks&#x27; notice—a chance against Willie &quot;The Worm&quot; Monroe, who was being trained by Frazier. Hagler lost the decision but the fight was close, so Monroe gave him a rematch. This time Hagler knocked out Monroe in twelve rounds. In a third fight, he defeated Monroe in two rounds.

Boston promoter Rip Valenti took an interest in Hagler and began bringing in top ranked opponents for Hagler to face. He fought 1972 Olympic gold medalist Sugar Ray Seales; Hagler won the first time, the second was a draw and Hagler knocked Seales out in the third fight. Number one ranked Mike Colbert was knocked out in the twelfth and also had his jaw broken by Hagler. Briton Kevin Finnegan was stopped in eight and required 40 facial stitches. He dropped a controversial decision to Bobby &#x27;Boogaloo&#x27; Watts preceding those victories, but knocked Watts out in two rounds in a rematch. Hagler won a ten-round decision over &#x27;Bad&#x27; Bennie Briscoe, which ultimately concluded his Spectrum expedition. By then, promoter Bob Arum took notice and signed him.

===First title shot===
In November 1979, Hagler fought world middleweight champion Vito Antuofermo at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada. When the fight was over after 15 rounds, most ringside observers thought that Hagler had won, even though Antuofermo had been closing the gap in the second half of the fight. Hagler claimed that referee Mills Lane told him he had won, but Lane later denied ever saying that. Hagler also noted that he and many others at ringside were surprised when the fight decision was announced as a draw. Judge Duane Ford scored the fight in Hagler&#x27;s favor, 145–141. However, judge Dalby Shirley scored the bout for Antuofermo, 144–142, while judge Hal Miller scored the fight even, 143–143. This fight result only added to Hagler&#x27;s frustrations, as Antuofermo retained his title with the draw. Hagler had the boxing skills and killer instinct to knock his opponent out, but instead he played it safe, as Antuofermo closed the gap late in the fight, and that late surge cost Hagler the title.

===World champion===
Antuofermo later lost his title to British boxer Alan Minter, who gave Hagler his second title shot. Hagler went to Wembley Arena to face Minter. The tense atmosphere was stoked further when Minter was quoted as saying that &quot;No black man is going to take my title&quot;—Minter later insisted he meant &quot;&quot;that&quot; black man&quot;. Hagler took command and his slashing punches soon opened up the cut-prone Minter. With Hagler dominating the action, referee Carlos Berrocal halted the fight during the third round to have the four glaring cuts on Minter&#x27;s face examined. Minter&#x27;s manager, Doug Bidwell, almost immediately conceded defeat. Once Berrocal waved the bout off, a riot broke out among the spectators. Clive Gammon of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; described the scene as &quot;a horrifying ululation of howls and boos.&quot; Hagler and his trainers had to be escorted to their locker room by a phalanx of policemen, all the while enduring a steady rain of beer bottles and glasses. After seven years and 50 fights, Hagler was the world middleweight champion.

Hagler proved a busy world champion. He defeated future world champion Fulgencio Obelmejias of Venezuela by a knockout in eight rounds and then former world champ Antuofermo in a rematch by TKO in four rounds. Both matches were fought at the Boston Garden near Hagler&#x27;s hometown, endearing him to Boston fight fans. Syrian born Mustafa Hamsho, who later defeated three-division world champion Wilfred Benítez and future world champion Bobby Czyz, became Hagler&#x27;s next challenger, putting up a lot of resistance before finally succumbing in eleven tough rounds. Michigan fighter William &quot;Caveman&quot; Lee lasted only one round and in a rematch in Italy, Obelmejias lasted five rounds. British champion (and mutual Alan Minter conqueror) Tony Sibson followed on Hagler&#x27;s ever-growing list of unsuccessful challengers. Sibson provided one of the most entertaining (to this point) fights of Marvelous Marvin&#x27;s career, but he ultimately fell short, lasting six rounds. Next came Wilford Scypion, who only lasted four. By then, Hagler was a staple on HBO, one of the first premium cable TV channels.

===Hagler vs. Durán===
A fight against Roberto Durán followed on November 10, 1983. Durán was the first challenger to last the distance with Hagler in a world-championship bout. Durán was the WBA light middleweight champion and went up in weight to challenge for Hagler&#x27;s middleweight crown. Hagler won a unanimous 15-round decision, although after 13 rounds, Durán was ahead by one point on two scorecards and even on the third. Hagler, with his left eye swollen and cut, came on strong in the last two rounds to win the fight. Judge Guy Jutras scored the bout 144–142. Judge Ove Ovesen scored it 144–143. Judge Yusaku Yoshida scored it 146–145.

===More title defenses===
Then came Juan Roldán of Argentina, who became the only man to be credited with a knockdown of Hagler, scoring one mere seconds into the fight. Hagler protested bitterly that he had been pulled/pushed to the canvas. Hagler thumbed Roldan&#x27;s left eye, then brutalized him over ten rounds and finally stopped him in the middle of round ten. Sugar Ray Leonard was calling the fight ringside with HBO analyst Barry Tompkins. He noted to Tompkins between rounds that Hagler looked older and slower. &quot;Marvin might finally be slowing down, Barry,&quot; Leonard remarked. Many people believe this is the fight that gave Sugar Ray Leonard the idea that he could actually win a fight with the aging Hagler.

Hamsho was given a rematch, but the Syrian was again TKO&#x27;d, this time in only three rounds. Hamsho angered Hagler with a trio of intentional headbutts in the second round and a fourth early in the third, goading the normally patient and cautious Hagler into a full-out attack that left Hamsho battered and defenseless in a matter of seconds.

===Hagler vs. Hearns===

After conquering Hamsho again, Hagler met Thomas Hearns on April 15, 1985, in what was billed as The Fight; it became known as &quot;The War&quot;.

Round One: Three minutes of violence. Within the first 15 seconds, Hearns landed his best punch, a straight right, onto Hagler&#x27;s chin. The champion stepped back, then came forward. At this point, Hagler began to walk through Hearns&#x27; power punches.

Round Two: Hagler was cut on his head from an unintentional elbow or headbutt. Despite the blood, the champion continued to push the fight forward. Hearns was fighting hurt as well, having suffered a broken right hand in the last minute of the first round. The pace continued as before, but now Hearns was backing up, trying to move around the ring. Hearns&#x27; trainer Emanuel Steward later revealed Hearns had a leg massage, much to Steward&#x27;s dismay, before the fight. Hearns&#x27; legs by the end of the round were weakening.

Round Three: The pace slowed until referee Richard Steele called a time out to have the ringside doctor examine the cut on Hagler&#x27;s head. The crowd was on its feet for the next ten seconds, before the doctor allowed the fight to continue. Hagler charged the much taller Hearns, drilling in an overhand right behind Hearns&#x27; ear. Hearns&#x27; legs wobbled and Hagler was on him quickly. Hearns toppled to the canvas, then rose at the count of eight, but collapsed into referee Steele&#x27;s arms. The fight was then halted.

The fight lasted only eight minutes and one second, but it was regarded as a classic. Commentator Al Michaels uttered the famous line, &quot;It didn&#x27;t go very far, but it was a beauty!&quot; The fight was named &quot;Fight of the Year&quot; by &quot;The Ring&quot;.

===Hagler vs. Mugabi===
Next was Olympic silver medalist John Mugabi of Uganda, who was 26–0 with 26 knockouts and was ranked the number one contender by all three major bodies. The fight took place on March 10, 1986, as Hagler had hurt his back and could not fight on the first date booked in 1985. Hagler stopped Mugabi in the eleventh round of a brutal fight. Many ringside observers, including analyst Gil Clancy, noticed that Hagler was showing signs of advanced ring wear and age. He was much slower of hand and foot and seemed much easier to hit. He had also completely morphed his ring style from a slick, quick-fisted, boxer/puncher to a strictly flat-footed, stalking, slugger to compensate for his loss of speed and reflexes. Hagler was now said to be seriously considering retirement. Hagler&#x27;s promoter Bob Arum was quoted as saying he was expecting Hagler to retire in the face of being challenged by Sugar Ray Leonard.

===Hagler vs. Leonard===

Hagler&#x27;s next challenger was Sugar Ray Leonard, who was returning to the ring after a three-year retirement (having fought just once in the previous five years). During the pre-fight negotiations, in return for granting Hagler a larger share of the purse, Leonard obtained several conditions which were crucial to his strategy: a ring instead of a smaller ring, gloves instead of gloves, and the fight was to be over twelve rounds instead of the 15 rounds favoured by Hagler. Leonard was two years younger, had half as many fights and unbeknownst to Hagler, had engaged in several &#x27;real&#x27; (i.e. gloves, rounds, a referee, judges and no headgear) fights behind closed doors in order to shake off his ring rust. The fight took place at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas on April 6, 1987. Hagler was the clear betting favorite after a dominant six and a half years as the reigning undisputed middleweight champion of the world, having knocked out all opponents as champion except in winning a very close unanimous decision over 15 rounds against Roberto Durán. It was Leonard&#x27;s first fight at middleweight ( weight limit). The fight was to be for Hagler&#x27;s WBC, lineal and &quot;Ring&quot; middleweight titles only, as the WBA stripped Hagler of their belt for choosing to face Leonard instead of WBA mandatory challenger Herol Graham. The IBF, while keeping Hagler as their champion, refused to sanction his fight against Leonard and said that the IBF middleweight title would be declared vacant if Hagler lost to Leonard.

Hagler, a natural southpaw, opened the fight boxing out of an orthodox stance. After the quick and slick Leonard won the first two rounds on all three scorecards, Hagler started the third round as a southpaw. Hagler then did much better, though Leonard&#x27;s superior speed and quick flurries kept him in the fight. But by the fifth, Leonard, who was moving a lot, began to tire and Hagler started to get closer. As Leonard tired he began to clinch with more frequency (in total referee Richard Steele gave him over 30 warnings for holding, although never deducted a point). Hagler buckled Leonard&#x27;s knees with a right uppercut near the end of the round, which finished with Leonard on the ropes. Hagler continued to score effectively in round six. Leonard, having slowed down, was obliged to fight more and run less.

In rounds seven and eight, Hagler&#x27;s southpaw jab was landing solidly and Leonard&#x27;s counter flurries were less frequent. Round nine was the most exciting round of the fight. Hagler hurt Leonard with a left cross and pinned him in a corner. Leonard was in trouble, then furiously tried to fight his way out of the corner. The action see-sawed for the rest of the round, with each man having his moments. Round ten was calmer even as Hagler continued to press forward and Leonard slowly got a second wind, as the pace slowed after the furious action of the previous round. Clearly tiring, Leonard boxed well in the eleventh. Every time Hagler scored, Leonard came back with something flashier, if not as effective. In the final round, Hagler continued to chase Leonard. He hit Leonard with a big left hand and backed him into a corner. Leonard responded with a flurry and danced away with Hagler in pursuit. The fight ended with Hagler and Leonard exchanging along the ropes. Hagler began dancing in celebration of his performance while Leonard collapsed to the canvas and raised both his arms in triumph. Leonard threw 629 punches and landed 306, while Hagler threw 792 and landed 291.

Hagler later said that, as the fighters embraced in the ring after the fight, Leonard said to him, &quot;You beat me, man.&quot; Hagler said after the fight, &quot;He said I beat him and I was so happy.&quot; Leonard denied making the statement and said he only told Hagler, &quot;You&#x27;re a great champion.&quot; HBO cameras and microphones supported Hagler&#x27;s version of events.

Leonard was announced as the winner and new middleweight champion of the world by split decision (118–110, 115–113, 113–115), a result which remains hotly disputed to this day. The Hagler vs. Leonard fight divides fans, pundits, press and ringside observers arguably more than any other fight in boxing history, with scorecards varying as widely as 117–111 Hagler to 118–110 Leonard and everything in between. The only near universally agreed views about the fight are that Hagler was foolish for starting the fight in an orthodox stance, that Leonard won the first two rounds and that Hagler won the fifth round. Every other round in the fight divides people as to who actually won it, or if the rounds were even.

====Post-fight reaction====
Official ringside judge JoJo Guerra, whose scorecard of 118–110 in favour of Leonard was derided in many quarters, commented that:

Upon a second viewing of the fight, while maintaining his belief that Leonard won the fight, Guerra acknowledged that he made a mistake and should have scored two more rounds for Hagler. Duane Ford, chairman of the Nevada State Athletic Commission, commented that Guerra probably would not be invited back to Las Vegas to judge a fight in the near future.

Judge Dave Moretti, who scored it 115–113 for Leonard, said:

Judge Lou Filippo, who scored it 115–113 for Hagler and felt that Hagler&#x27;s bodyshots and aggression earned him the nod, said:

Hugh McIlvanney, commenting in the British &quot;Sunday Times&quot; and &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;:

McIlvanney also referred to Budd Schulberg&#x27;s contention about a &#x27;compound optical illusion&#x27;, namely that by being the underdog and more competitive than expected against the dominant undisputed champion in Hagler meant that Leonard appeared more effective and to be doing more than he actually was. Leonard himself had said to journalists before the fight &quot;the reason I will win is because you don&#x27;t think I can&quot;. Harry Gibbs, the British judge who had been rejected by Pat Petronelli from Hagler&#x27;s camp and replaced by JoJo Guerra, said he scored it 115–113 for Hagler when he watched the fight at home.

Jim Murray, long-time sports columnist for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; felt that Leonard deservedly got the decision, arguing that Leonard showed better defense and ring generalship, landed more punches and writing:

The scorecards from the ringside press and broadcast media attest to the polarizing views and opinions of the fight (17 for Leonard, 18 for Hagler, 6 calling it a draw):

====Rematch====
Hagler requested a rematch but Leonard chose to retire again (the third of five high-profile retirements announced by Leonard during his professional boxing career), having announced it beforehand. Fourteen months following their fight, Hagler retired from boxing on June 13, 1988, after watching WBA middleweight champion Sumbu Kalambay prevail over his brother, Robbie Sims, via unanimous decision. Hagler declared that he was &quot;tired of waiting&quot; for Leonard to grant him a rematch. Just a month succeeding Hagler&#x27;s retirement, Leonard announced another boxing comeback to fight against WBC light heavyweight champion Donny Lalonde at the super middleweight limit. In 1990, Leonard finally offered Hagler a rematch which reportedly would have earned him $15 million, but he declined. By then, Hagler had settled down into a new life as an actor in Italy and was now uninterested in his past boxing life. Hagler said &quot;A while ago, yeah, I wanted him so bad, but I&#x27;m over that.&quot; At the 1994 Consumer Electronics Show, Hagler and Leonard had a mock rematch by playing against each other in the video game &quot;Boxing Legends of the Ring&quot; and claimed that an actual rematch was being planned, though it never happened.

==Life after boxing==
After the loss to Leonard, Hagler moved to Italy, where he became a well-known star of action films. His roles included a U.S. Marine in the films &quot;Indio&quot; (1989) and &quot;Indio 2&quot; (1991). In 1997, he starred alongside Terence Hill and Giselle Blondet in &quot;Virtual Weapon&quot;. Hagler also provided boxing commentary for British television. Another foray by Hagler into the entertainment field included work on the video game &quot;Fight Night: Round 3&quot;.

==Personal life==
Hagler had five children with his first wife, Bertha. Although he owned a home in Bartlett, New Hampshire, Hagler lived in Milan. In May 2000, he married his second wife, Kay, an Italian, in Pioltello, Italy.
==Death==
On March 13, 2021, Hagler&#x27;s wife, Kay, announced that he had died of natural causes at his home in New Hampshire at the age of 66. His son James said his father was taken to a New Hampshire hospital after experiencing chest pains and difficulty breathing.

<doc id="84955" wikidata="Q336003" url="?curid=84955" title="Abundantia">
<text>In ancient Roman religion, Abundantia (), also called Copia, was a divine personification of abundance and prosperity. The name Abundantia means &quot;abundance&quot; in Latin. She would help protect your savings and investments. Abundantia would even assist someone with major purchases. She was among the embodiments of virtues in religious propaganda that cast the emperor as the ensurer of &quot;Golden Age&quot; conditions. Abundantia thus figures in art, cult, and literature, but has little mythology as such. She may have survived in some form in Roman Gaul and medieval France. Abundantia would carry a cornucopia that was filled with grain and coins. She would occasionally leave some of her grain or money at someone&#x27;s house as a gift.

==In Rome==
The Augustan poet Ovid gives Abundantia a role in the myth of Acheloüs the river god, one of whose horns was ripped from his forehead by Hercules. The horn was taken by the Naiads and transformed into the cornucopia that was granted to Abundantia. Other aetiological myths provide different explanations of the cornucopia&#x27;s origin. On Neronian coinage, she was associated with Ceres and equated with Annona, who embodied the grain supply. Like Annona, Abundantia was a &quot;virtue in action&quot; in such locations as the harbor, where grain entered the city. Coinage in Rome depicts her either holding the cornucopia or pouring out the riches contained within the cornucopia. Occasionally she is depicted as holding wheat or standing on a ship. It is unknown what her appearance on ships represents. Abundantia appears on the medals of many emperors. Such as Trajan, Antoninus Pius, Caracalla, Elagabalus, Severus Alexander, Gordian, Decius, Gallienus, Tetricus, Probus, Numerian, Carinus, Carus, Diocletian, and Galerius. She appears alongside one of several inscriptions: Abundantia, Abundantia Perpetua, Augustorum Nostrorum, Augustorum Augg NN, and Augustia Aug. Mithraic iconography on a vase from Lezoux, in the Roman province of Gallia Aquitania depicts this deity seating, and holding a cornucopia as a symbol of &quot;the abundance that stems from Mithras&#x27; act&quot;.

==Possible survivals==
It has been suggested that the Gallic goddess Rosmerta had a functional equivalence to Abundantia, but the two are never directly identified in inscriptions. William of Auvergne (d. 1249), a bishop of Paris, mentions a Domina Abundia (&quot;Mistress Abundia&quot;), who also appears in the &quot;Roman de la Rose&quot; as &quot;Dame Habonde.&quot; The bishop derives her name from &quot;abundantia&quot;. At night the &quot;dominae&quot; enter houses where offerings have been set out for them. They eat and drink from the vessels, but the contents are undiminished. If they are pleased, they bring prosperity and fertility. William regarded these practices as a form of idolatry. Folklorists of the 19th century saw these figures as Celtic fairies.

Nicholas of Cusa reports that on his travels through the French Alps in 1457, he met two old women who told him they were in the service of Domina Abundia. They identified themselves as apostate Christians, and had been imprisoned for witchcraft. Nicholas felt that they had been deluded by the devil, but should be allowed to receive penance rather than burning at the stake.

==Later art and allegory==
In later Western art, Abundantia is often portrayed holding her cornucopia and sheaves of corn or wheat.

<text>Theodor Fontane (; 30 December 1819 – 20 September 1898) was a German novelist and poet, regarded by many as the most important 19th-century German-language realist author. He published the first of his novels, for which he is best known today, only at age 58 after a career as a journalist. Many of his novels delve into topics that were more or less taboo for discussion in the polite society of Fontane&#x27;s day, including marital infidelity, class differences, urban vs. rural differences, abandonment of children, and suicide. His novels sold well during his lifetime and several have been adapted for film or audio works.

Fontane&#x27;s novels are known for their complex, often sceptical view of society in the German empire. He shows different social and political parts of society meeting and sometimes clashing, his main characters range from lower-middle class to Prussian nobility. Fontane is known as a writer of realism, not only because he was conscientious about the factual accuracy of details in fictional scenes, but also because he depicted his characters in terms of what they said or did and refrained from overtly imputing motives to them. Other trademarks of Fontane&#x27;s work are their strongly drawn female characters (such as &quot;Effi Briest&quot; and &quot;Frau Jenny Treibel&quot;), tender irony and vivid conversations between characters.

== Life ==
===Youth===

Fontane was born in Neuruppin, a town 30 miles northwest of Berlin, into a Huguenot family. At the age of sixteen he was apprenticed to an apothecary, his father&#x27;s profession. He became an apothecary himself and in 1839, at the age of 20, wrote his first work (&quot;Heinrichs IV. erste Liebe&quot;, now lost). His further education was in Leipzig, where he became acquainted with the progressives of the Vormärz.

Fontane&#x27;s first published work, the novella &quot;Geschwisterliebe&quot; (Sibling Love), was published in the &quot;Berlin Figaro&quot; in December 1839. His biographer Gordon A. Craig claims that this gave few indications of being a gifted writer: &quot;Although the theme of incest, which was to occupy Fontane on later occasions, is touched upon here, the mawkishness of the tale... is equalled by the lameness of its plot and the inertness of the style in which it is told, and [the characters] Clärchen and her brother are both so colourless that no one could have guessed that their creator had a future as a writer.&quot;

Fontane&#x27;s first job as apothecary was in Dresden, after which he worked in his father&#x27;s shop in the town of Letschin in the Oderbruch region. Fleeing its provincialism, Fontane published articles in the Leipzig newspaper &quot;Die Eisenbahn&quot; and translated Shakespeare. In 1843 he joined a literary club in Berlin named Tunnel über der Spree (Tunnel over the River Spree) where he became acquainted with many of the most renowned German writers, including Theodor Storm, Joseph von Eichendorff and Gottfried Keller.

===Newspaper writer and critic===
In 1844, Fontane enlisted in the Prussian army and began the first of numerous journeys to England, which fostered his interest in Old English ballads, which he – a lifelong anglophile – began to imitate. In 1845 became engaged to his future wife, Emilie Rouanet-Kummer, whom he had met when still at school.

Fontane played a brief part in the revolutionary events of 1848. In 1849 he left his job as an apothecary and became a full-time journalist and writer. In order to provide for his family he accepted a job as a writer with the Prussian intelligence agency &quot;Zentralstelle für Presseangelegenheiten&quot;, which was intended to influence the press towards the German nationalist cause. There he specialized in British affairs, and the agency made him for several years its correspondent in London, where he was later joined by Emilie, whom he had married in 1850, and their first two sons. While still in London he left his government job and on his return to Berlin became editor of the conservative newspaper &quot;Neue Preussische Zeitung&quot;. As a man of liberal sympathies for free press and a united Germany Fontane ruefully wrote to a friend about his job with the &quot;Zeitung&quot;: &quot;I sold myself to the reaction for thirty pieces of silver a month... These days one cannot survive as an honest man.&quot;

===London===

Fontane&#x27;s travel books about Britain include &quot;Ein Sommer in London&quot; (A Summer in London, 1854), &quot;Aus England, Studien und Briefe&quot; (From England: Studies and Letters, 1860) and &quot;Jenseit des Tweed, Bilder und Briefe aus Schottland&quot; (Beyond the Tweed, Pictures and Letters from Scotland, 1860). In the books Fontane reflects both nature and the mood in Britain at that time. The success of the historical novels of Walter Scott had helped to make British themes much in vogue on the Continent. Fontane&#x27;s &quot;Gedichte&quot; (Poems, 1851) and ballads &quot;Männer und Helden&quot; (Men and Heroes, 1860) tell of Britain&#x27;s former glories.
Back in Germany Fontane became particularly interested in his home province, the March of Brandenburg. He enjoyed rambling through its rural landscapes and small towns and delighted in the growth of its capital city, Berlin. His fascination with the countryside surrounding Berlin may be seen in his picturesque &quot;Wanderungen durch die Mark Brandenburg&quot; (Walks through the Province of Brandenburg, 1862–82, 5 vols), in which he extended his earlier fascination with British history to his native land.

===Wars of German Unification===
In 1870, Fontane quit his job at the &quot;Kreuzzeitung&quot; and became drama critic for the liberal &quot;Vossische Zeitung&quot;, a job he held until his retirement. He had already written about Prussia&#x27;s war against Denmark in &quot;Der schleswig-holsteinische Krieg im Jahre 1864&quot; (1866) and the Austro-Prussian War in &quot;Der deutsche Krieg von 1866&quot; (1869). He went to the front to observe the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 and after being taken prisoner at Vaucouleurs remained in French captivity for three months. He memorialized his experiences in &quot;Kriegsgefangen Erlebtes 1870&quot; (Experiences as a Prisoner of War, 1871) and published his observations concerning the campaign in the book &quot;Der Krieg gegen Frankreich 1870–71&quot; (The War against France, 1870–71, published 1874–76). In his observations he strongly criticized Prussian militarism: &quot;A mere glorification of the military without moral content or elevated aim is nauseating.&quot;

===Later years===

At the age of 57, Fontane finally began work on his novels, for which he is remembered best today. Fontane&#x27;s lifelong wish to be able to live from his literary works was finally fulfilled. A fine historical romance, &quot;Vor dem Sturm&quot; (&quot;Before the Storm&quot;, 1878), was followed by a series exploring modern life, notably &quot;L&#x27;Adultera&quot; (&quot;Woman Taken in Adultery&quot;, 1882), which was the first of his society novels and deemed risky for its theme of adultery.

His novels &quot;Irrungen, Wirrungen&quot; (&quot;Trials and Tribulations&quot;, 1888), &quot;Frau Jenny Treibel&quot; (1892) and &quot;Effi Briest&quot; (1894–95) yielded insights into the lives of the nobility and middle-class citizens. His achievement in this regard was later described as poetic realism. In &quot;Der Stechlin&quot; (written 1895–97), his last completed novel, Fontane adapted the realistic methods and social criticism of contemporary French fiction to the conditions of Prussian life.

===Death===
Fontane was plagued by health problems during his last years but continued to work until a few hours before his death. He died in the evening of 20 September 1898 in Berlin. As a member of the French Protestant Church of Berlin he was buried in the congregation&#x27;s cemetery on the Liesenstraße. His wife, Emilie, was buried beside him four years later. Their graves were damaged during World War II but later restored.

== Concerns about possible anti-semitism ==

In the 21st century, some scholars have singled out Fontane&#x27;s works as containing anti-semitic passages, and have gone so far as to withdraw from studying his work in solidarity with what they consider enlightened sensibility. Not all scholars agree about this. If anti-semitism can be discerned in Fontane&#x27;s fictional works, it could be seen as a reflection of the mainstream views of the society in which he lived. For example, in some novels including &quot;Under the Pear Tree&quot; and &quot;Unwiederbringlich&quot;, there is mention of the Jewish heritage of a few key characters, as though this conveyed useful information to listeners (or perhaps readers). But the works themselves do not present any interpretation about the importance of that information, only noting that the characters were aware of it.

<text>Anita Brookner (16 July 1928 – 10 March 2016) was an English novelist and art historian. She was Slade Professor of Fine Art at the University of Cambridge from 1967 to 1968 and was the first woman to hold this visiting professorship. She was awarded the 1984 Booker–McConnell Prize for her novel &quot;Hotel du Lac&quot;.

==Life and education==
Brookner (Bruckner) was born in Herne Hill, a suburb of London. She was the only child of Newson Bruckner, a Jewish immigrant from Piotrków Trybunalski in Poland, and Maude Schiska, a singer whose grandfather had emigrated from Warsaw, Poland, and founded a tobacco factory at which her husband worked after arriving in Britain aged 18. Her mother gave up her singing career when she married and, according to her daughter, was unhappy for the rest of her life. Maude changed the family&#x27;s surname to Brookner because of anti-German sentiment in Britain following World War I. Anita Brookner had a lonely childhood, although her grandmother and uncle lived with the family, and her parents, secular Jews, opened their house to Jewish refugees fleeing the Germans during the 1930s and World War II. &quot;I have said that I am one of the loneliest women in London&quot; she said in her &quot;Paris Review&quot; interview.

She was educated at the James Allen&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School, a fee-paying school. In 1949 she received a BA in history from King&#x27;s College London, and in 1953 a doctorate in art history from the Courtauld Institute of Art, University of London. Under the supervision of Anthony Blunt, then director of the Courtauld, what was originally a Masters thesis on the French genre painter Jean-Baptiste Greuze was upgraded to a doctorate. However, she received a French government scholarship in 1950 to the École du Louvre and spent most of the decade living in Paris.

==Career==
===Academic===
In 1967, she became the first woman to hold the Slade Professorship of Fine Art at Cambridge University. She was a visiting lecturer at Reading University from 1959 to 1964 when she became a lecturer at the Courtauld Institute of Art. She was promoted to Reader at the Courtauld in 1977, where she worked until her retirement in 1988. She began her career as a specialist on 18th century French art but later extended her expertise to the romantics. She contributed articles to &quot;ArtReview&quot; in the late 1950s and early 1960s,

Among her students at the Courtauld was art historian Olivier Berggruen, whose graduate work she advised. She was a Fellow of King&#x27;s College London and of New Hall, Cambridge (Murray Edwards College from 2008).

Photographs taken by Anita Brookner are held in the Conway Library of art and architecture at the Courtauld Institute.

===Novelist===
Brookner published her first novel, &quot;A Start in Life&quot; (1981), at the age of 53. Thereafter she published roughly one a year. Brookner was regarded as a stylist. Her novels explore themes of emotional loss and difficulties associated with fitting into society, and intellectual, middle-class women, who suffer isolation and disappointments in love. Many of her characters are the children of European immigrants to Britain; a number appear to be of Jewish descent. &quot;Hotel du Lac&quot; (1984), her fourth novel, was awarded the Booker Prize.

==Private life and honours==
Brookner never married, but took care of her parents as they aged. Brookner commented in one interview that she had received several proposals of marriage, but rejected all of them, concluding that men were &quot;people with their own agenda, who think you might be fitted in if they lop off certain parts. You can see them coming a mile off&quot;. She gave the 1974 Aspects of Art Lecture. In 1990, she was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). She died in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, London, on 10 March 2016, at the age of 87.

<doc id="84959" wikidata="Q338298" url="?curid=84959" title="Acca Larentia">
<text>Acca Larentia or Acca Larentina was a mythical woman, later a goddess of fertility, in Roman mythology whose festival, the Larentalia, was celebrated on December 23.

== Myths ==

=== Foster mother ===
In one mythological tradition (that of Licinius Macer, et al.), Acca Larentia was the wife of the shepherd Faustulus. And after Romulus and Remus were thrown into the Tiber river, Faustulus brought them back to his home, where Acca Larentia would raise the children. She had twelve sons, and on the death of one of them Romulus took his place. and with the remaining eleven founded the college of the Arval brothers (Fratres Arvales). She is therefore identified with the Dea Dia of that collegium. The flamen Quirinalis acted in the role of Romulus (deified as Quirinus) to perform funerary rites for his foster mother.

===Benefactor of Rome===
Another tradition holds that Larentia was a beautiful prostitute (&quot;scortum&quot;) of notorious reputation, roughly the same age as Romulus and Remus, during the reign of Ancus Marcius in the 7th century BCE. She was awarded to Hercules as a prize in a game of dice by the guardian of his temple, and locked in it with his other prize, a feast. When the god no longer had need of her, he advised her to marry the first man to proposition her as she stepped out that morning, who turned out to be a wealthy Etruscan named Carutius (or Tarrutius, according to Plutarch). Larentia later inherited all his property and bequeathed it to the Roman people. Ancus, in gratitude for this, allowed her to be buried in the Velabrum, and instituted an annual festival, the Larentalia, at which sacrifices were offered to the Lares. Plutarch explicitly states that this Larentia was a different person from the Larentia who was married to Faustulus, although other writers, such as Licinius Macer, relate their stories as belonging to the same individual.

===Prostitute===
Yet another tradition holds that Larentia was neither the wife of Faustulus nor the consort of Hercules, but a courtesan called &quot;lupa&quot; by the shepherds. Lupa literally means &quot;she-wolf&quot;, although the word colloquially meant &quot;prostitute&quot;. The legend also states that she left the fortune she amassed through prostitution to the Roman people.

===Connection to Lares ===
Whatever may be thought of the contradictory accounts of Acca Larentia, it seems clear that she was of Etruscan origin, thus possibly connected with the worship of the Lares. It is entirely possible her name may be derived from Lares. This relation is also apparent in the number of her sons, which corresponds to that of the twelve country Lares. Wiseman explores the connections among Acca Larentia, Lara, and Larunda in several of his books. Acca Larentia has also been associated with another Roman Goddess named Dea Dia.

==Functions==
Like Ceres, Tellus, Flora, and others, Acca Larentia symbolized the fertility of the earth, in particular the city lands and their crops. Acca Larentia is also identified with Larentina, Mana Genita, and Muta.

==In modern literature==
Acca is a character in David Drake&#x27;s story &quot;To Bring the Light&quot;, a reconstruction of Rome&#x27;s beginnings around 751 BCE. She is depicted as a sympathetic village woman in the small shepherd community on Palatine Hill from which Rome would begin.

<doc id="84960" wikidata="Q3981217" url="?curid=84960" title="Tarutius">
<text>In Roman mythology, Tarutius or Tarrutius was a wealthy merchant married to Acca Larentia. According to Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Life of Romulus&quot;, the keeper of the Temple of Hercules challenged the hero to a game of dice with Hercules to receive a night with a beautiful woman and a fine spread and the god to provide the temple keeper with a valuable gift if the keeper was successful.

As Hercules won the contest, the keeper procured the services of Acca Larentia for the night and provided a fine supper. In the morning, Hercules suggested that she approach the first man she met on leaving the temple. Tarutius was the man whom she met and the couple ended up marrying. Tarutius was a wealthy, older man with a large estate and is often believed to be an Etruscan.

Tarutius died shortly after their marriage, leaving no children. Acca Larentia inherited the estate and,when she disappeared, her will was found devoting the estate to Rome. This version is considered to be the basis for the full legal entitlement of areas claimed by Rome.

Augustine of Hippo referred to the legend in his book &quot;The City of God&quot; as an example of how the pagan gods are supposed to have delighted in human sensual pleasures. In St. Augustine&#x27;s version, Tarutius is held to be a younger man whom Acca Larentia meets after spending the night with Hercules in a dream. Tarutius is held to have had kept Acca Larentia as his mistress for many years, leaving his estate to her on his death. She in turn leaves the estate to Rome in her will, which is found when she mysteriously disappears.

<text>In Roman mythology, Faustulus was the shepherd who found the infant Romulus (the future founder of the city of Rome) and his twin brother Remus along the banks of the Tiber River as they were being suckled by the she-wolf, Lupa. According to legend, Faustulus carried the babies back to his sheepfold for his wife Acca Larentia to nurse them. Faustulus and Acca Larentia then raised the boys as their own. Romulus later defeated and killed King Amulius of Alba Longa, with the help of Faustulus, and his brother Pleistinus. Romulus and Remus set out to build their own city, but then had a falling-out. In the ensuing skirmish, Faustulus and Pleistinus were killed. Romulus went on to found Rome.

== Representation in Livy&#x27;s &quot;From the Founding of the City&quot; ==
The Roman historian Livy details the story of the infants Romulus and Remus in his work &quot;Ab urbe condita libri&quot; (From the Founding of the City). According to Livy, after the rape of the Vestal Virgin Rhea Silvia, who later claimed Mars as the father (either out of truth or for the respectability that came of divine providence, as Livy points out), King Amulius, the twin&#x27;s great-uncle, ordered the infants put into a basket and sent down the Tiber River to their deaths by drowning. In this year, the Tiber had flooded and as such, carried the boys into a flatland. When the water receded, it dropped the boys on a flat piece of land where the she-wolf, known as Lupa, found and nursed them. According to Livy, some shepherds referred to Acca Larentia as the &#x27;she-wolf&#x27; because of her sexual promiscuity, and this may be how the tale of the twins suckling at the teat of the she-wolf came to be. Either way, Faustulus carried the infants back to his sheepfold where he presented the children to his wife to rear. Faustulus and Acca Larentia raised the boys as their own, and they grew to be shepherds. According to Livy, Faustulus was aware of the royal lineage of the twins from the beginning, writing:

From the very beginning Faustulus had entertained the suspicion that they were children of the royal blood that he was bringing up in his house; for he was aware both that infants had been exposed by order of the king, and that the time when he had himself taken up the children exactly coincided with that event.Faustulus withheld his knowledge of the twin&#x27;s lineage, choosing instead to wait &quot;until opportunity offered or necessity compelled.&quot; According to Livy, necessity came first, as Remus had been captured by Numitor, the former King, a descendant of Aeneas, father of Rhea Silvia, and maternal grandfather of Romulus and Remus. Faustulus revealed the true nature of the twin&#x27;s birth to Romulus. At the same time, Numitor realized the boy he held in custody was his grandson Remus, and so a plan was hatched to slay King Amulius. Romulus gathered a band of shepherds and, combined with Remus&#x27;s forces from the house of Numitor, attacked and killed the king. The twins declared the death of the tyrant and named their grandfather king. According to Livy, this was followed by a &quot;shout of assent...from the entire throng [which] confirmed the new monarch&#x27;s title and authority.&quot;

== Representation in Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Parallel Lives&quot; ==
Greek philosopher, biographer, and essayist Plutarch, addresses Faustulus in his section, &quot;The Life of Romulus,&quot; in his work &quot;Parallel Lives.&quot; Plutarch largely follows Livy&#x27;s description of Faustulus in his work, &quot;From the Founding of the City,&quot; while offering some additional information and contending ideas. Plutarch notes that the servant whom King Amulius ordered to set the twins down the Tiber was referred to by some as Faustulus. Plutarch also claims that Numitor most likely knew of Faustulus and Acca Larentia&#x27;s raising Romulus and Remus, and &quot;secretly aided the foster-parents in their task.&quot; According to Plutarch, Faustulus was at one point brought before Numitor to confirm the livelihood of the boys.

== Etymology ==
Faustulus&#x27; name being tied to that of &quot;faunus&quot; is generally rejected by the scholarship, with many detailing how Faustulus is derived from &quot;faveo&quot; (Latin: befriend, support, back up). The name Faustulus is further derived from &quot;favestos&quot;, as the &quot;verbal adjective underlying his name, must be linked to the religious sense of &quot;faveo&quot; expressed in the ritual formula &quot;favete linguis&quot;&quot; meaning &#x27;be silent&#x27;. These Latin roots help to explain why Faustulus remained silent about the nature of Romulus and Remus&#x27; lineage for so long. Many have historically viewed Faustulus as a &quot;wolfish&quot; character, but this has no historical or etymological basis, and is generally thought to be the result of popular association of fauna and Faustulus.

== Death ==
According to Plutarch, Faustulus, along with his brother Pleistinus, was killed in the same skirmish that resulted in Romulus slaying his brother Remus before the founding of the city of Rome.

<text>Turnus () was the legendary King of the Rutuli in Roman history, and the chief antagonist of the hero Aeneas in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;.

According to the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Turnus is the son of Daunus and the nymph Venilia and is brother of the nymph Juturna.

==Historical tradition==

While there is limited information in historical sources about Turnus, some key details about Turnus and the Rutuli differ significantly from the account in the Aeneid. The only source predating the Aeneid is Marcus Porcius Cato&#x27;s &quot;Origines&quot;. Turnus is also mentioned by Livy in his &quot;Ab Urbe Condita&quot; and by Dionysius of Halicarnassus in his (&quot;Rômaïkê Archaiologia&quot;, &quot;Roman Antiquities&quot;), both of which come later than the &quot;Aeneid&quot;. Turnus is mentioned in the Pseudo-Jasher, along with Angeas of Africa. 

In all of these historical sources, Turnus&#x27; heritage is unclear. Dionysius calls him &quot;Tyrrhenus&quot;, which means &quot;Etruscan&quot;, while other sources suggest a Greek ancestry. In all of these sources, Turnus and his Rutulians are settled in Italy prior to the arrival of the Trojans and are involved in the clash between the Latins and the Trojans, but there is a great deal of discrepancy in details. It appears that Virgil drew on a variety of historical sources for the background of Turnus in the &quot;Aeneid&quot;.

==Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;==

Prior to Aeneas&#x27; arrival in Italy, Turnus was the primary potential suitor of Lavinia, the only daughter of Latinus, King of the Latin people. Upon Aeneas&#x27; arrival, however, Lavinia is promised to the Trojan prince. Juno, determined to prolong the suffering of the Trojans, prompts Turnus to demand a war with the new arrivals. King Latinus is greatly displeased with Turnus, but steps down and allows the war to commence.

During the War between the Latins and the Trojans (along with several other Trojan allies, including King Evander&#x27;s Arcadians), Turnus proves himself to be brave but hot-headed. In Book IX, he nearly takes the fortress of the Trojans after defeating many opponents, but soon gets into trouble and is only saved from death by Juno.

In Book X, Turnus slays the son of Evander, the young prince Pallas. As he gloats over the killing, he takes as a spoil of war Pallas&#x27; sword belt and puts it on. Enraged, Aeneas seeks out the Rutulian King with full intent of killing him. Virgil marks the death of Pallas by mentioning the inevitable downfall of Turnus. To prevent his death at the hands of Aeneas, Juno conjures a ghost apparition of Aeneas, luring Turnus onto a ship and to his safety. Turnus takes great offense at this action, questioning his worth and even contemplating suicide.

In Book XII, Aeneas and Turnus duel to the death; Aeneas gains the upper hand amidst a noticeably Iliad-esque chase sequence (Aeneas pursues Turnus ten times round, between the walls of Latium and the lines of men, much as in the duel between Achilles and Hector), wounding Turnus in the thigh. Turnus begs Aeneas either to spare him or give his body back to his people. Aeneas considers but upon seeing the belt of Pallas on Turnus, he is consumed by rage and finishes him off. The last line of the poem describes Turnus&#x27; unhappy passage into the Underworld.

Turnus&#x27; supporters include: his sister and minor river/fountain deity, Juturna; Latinus&#x27;s wife, Amata; the deposed king of the Etruscans, Mezentius; and Queen Camilla of the Volsci, allies in Turnus’ fight against Aeneas, the Trojans, and their allies.

==In later literature==
The &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; connected Turnus with the Turoni, and the city of Tours: &quot; was exiled on account of the death of Turnus, slain by Aeneas. He then went among the Gauls and built a city of the Turones, called Turnis [Tours]&quot;. In the Middle English poem &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;, the unknown poet cites as a parallel to Brutus of Troy&#x27;s founding of Britain, that of an unidentified &quot;Ticius&quot; to Tuscany. Although some scholars have argued that &quot;Titius&quot; is derived from Titus Tatius, Otis Chapman has proposed that &quot;Ticius&quot; is a scribal error for what the poet intended to read as Turnus. On top of manuscript stylometric evidence, Chapman notes that in a passage in Ranulf Higdon&#x27;s &quot;Polychronicon&quot;, Turnus is also named as King of Tuscany. This suggests that legends in the age after Virgil came to identify Turnus &quot;as a legendary figure like Aeneas, Romulus, &#x27;Langeberde&#x27;, and Brutus&quot;.
In Book IX of John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, the story of Turnus and Lavinia is mentioned in relation to God&#x27;s anger at Adam and Eve.

==Interpretation==
Turnus can be seen as a &quot;new Achilles&quot;, due to his Greek ancestry and his fierceness. According to Barry Powell, he may also represent Mark Antony or local peoples who must submit to Rome&#x27;s empire. Powell adds that in the dispute between Turnus and Aeneas, Turnus may have the moral upper hand, having been arranged to marry Lavinia first. However, Turnus must be stopped since he is running counter to the force of destiny.

<text>In Roman mythology, Lavinia ( ; ) is the daughter of Latinus and Amata, and the last wife of Aeneas.

==Creation==
It has been proposed that the character was in part intended to represent Servilia Isaurica, Emperor Augustus&#x27;s first fiancée.

==Story==
Lavinia, the only child of the king and &quot;ripe for marriage&quot;, had been courted by many men who hoped to become the king of Latium. Turnus, ruler of the Rutuli, was the most likely of the suitors, having the favor of Queen Amata. In Virgil&#x27;s account, King Latinus is warned by his father Faunus in a dream oracle that his daughter is not to marry a Latin:

Lavinia has what is perhaps her most, or only, memorable moment in Book 7 of the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, lines 94–104: during a sacrifice at the altars of the gods, Lavinia&#x27;s hair catches fire, an omen promising glorious days to come for Lavinia and war for all Latins:

Not long after the dream oracle and the prophetic moment, Aeneas sends emissaries bearing several gifts for King Latinus. King Latinus recognizes Aeneas as the destined one:

Aeneas is said to have named the ancient city of Lavinium for her. 

By some accounts, Aeneas and Lavinia had a son, Silvius, a legendary king of Alba Longa. According to Livy, Ascanius was the son of Aeneas and Lavinia; she led the Latins as a power behind the throne since Ascanius was too young to rule. In Livy&#x27;s account, Silvius is the son of Ascanius.

== In other works ==
In Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s 2008 novel &quot;Lavinia&quot;, Lavinia&#x27;s character and her relationship with Aeneas is expanded, giving insight into the life of a king&#x27;s daughter in ancient Italy. Le Guin employs a self-conscious narrative device in having Lavinia as the first-person narrator knowing that she would not have a life without Virgil, who, being the writer of the &quot;Aeneid&quot; several centuries after her time, is thus her creator.

Lavinia also appears with her father, King Latinus, in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, &quot;Inferno&quot;, Canto IV, lines 125–126. She is documented in &quot;De Mulieribus Claris&quot;, a collection of biographies of historical and mythological women by the Florentine author Giovanni Boccaccio, composed in 136162.

<text>In Roman mythology, Acestes or Egestes () was the son of the Sicilian river-god Crinisus by a Dardanian or Trojan woman named Egesta or Segesta.

According to Servius, this woman Egesta or Segesta was sent by her father, Hippotes or Ipsostratus, to Sicily, that she might not be devoured by the monsters which infested the territory of Troy and which had been sent into the land, because the Trojans had refused to reward Poseidon and Apollo for having built the walls of their city. When Egesta arrived in Sicily, the river-god Crinisus in the form of a bear or a dog sired with her a son named Acestes, who was afterwards regarded as the hero who had founded the town of Segesta.

The funeral games of Aeneas&#x27;s father Anchises were held there. Those of Aeneas&#x27;s folk who wished to voyage no further were allowed to remain behind with Acestes and together with Acestes&#x27;s people they founded the city of Acesta, that is Segesta.

The &quot;Aeneid&quot; cites him as giving wine as a farewell gift to Aeneas as he is leaving Sicily.

==Mythological tradition of Dionysius==
The tradition of Acestes in Dionysius of Halicarnassus, who calls him Aegestus (), is different, for according to him, the grandfather of Aegestus quarreled with Laomedon, who slew him and gave his daughters to some merchants to convey them to a distant land. A noble Trojan however embarked with them, and married one of them in Sicily, where she subsequently gave birth to a son, Aegestus. During the war against Troy Aegestus obtained permission from Priam to return and take part in the contest, and afterwards returned to Sicily, where Aeneas on his arrival was hospitably received by him and Elymus, and built for them the towns of Aegesta and Elyme. The account of Dionysius seems to be nothing but a rationalistic interpretation of the genuine legend.

== Arrow of Acestes ==
In the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Acestes participates in a trial of skill in which he shoots his arrow which then bursts into flame as a sign from Jupiter of Acestes&#x27;s deserved honor.

<text>:&quot;This is for the mythical allies of Aeneas. For the story written about them by Virgil, see Aeneid&quot;
In Roman mythology, the Aeneads () were the friends, family and companions of Aeneas, with whom they fled from Troy after the Trojan War. Aenides was another patronymic from Aeneas, which is applied by Gaius Valerius Flaccus to the inhabitants of Cyzicus, whose town was believed to have been founded by Cyzicus, the son of Aeneas and Aenete. Similarly, Aeneades (Ancient Greek: ) was a patronymic from Aeneas, and applied as a surname to those who were believed to have been descended from him, such as Ascanius, Augustus, and the Romans in general.

The Aeneads included:
*[[Achates (Aeneid)|Achates]]
*Acmon, son of Clytius (son of Aeolus),
*[[Anchises]]
*[[Creusa (wife of Aeneas)|Creusa]], wife of Aeneas and mother of Ascanius
*[[Ascanius]]
*[[Gyas]]
*[[Iapyx]]
*the [[Lares]]
*[[Nisus and Euryalus]], heroes of the helmet episode in Book 9
*[[Aeneads|Mimas]]
*[[Misenus]], Aeneas&#x27; trumpeter
*[[Mnestheus]], possibly Aeneas&#x27; most senior commander
*the [[Penates]]
*Serestus
*[[Sergestus]]
*[[Achaemenides]], one of Odysseus&#x27; crew the Aeneads picked up in Sicily (strictly speaking &quot;not&quot; an Aenead as he was not Trojan, but Greek).

<text>Aequitas (genitive &quot;aequitatis&quot;) is the Latin concept of justice, equality, conformity, symmetry, or fairness. It is the origin of the English word &quot;equity&quot;. In ancient Rome, it could refer to either the legal concept of equity, or fairness between individuals.

Cicero defined &quot;aequitas&quot; as &quot;tripartite&quot;: the first, he said, pertained to the gods above &quot;(ad superos deos)&quot; and is equivalent to &quot;pietas&quot;, religious obligation; the second, to the Manes, the underworld spirits or spirits of the dead, and was &quot;sanctitas&quot;, that which is sacred; and the third pertaining to human beings &quot;(homines)&quot; was &quot;iustitia&quot;, &quot;justice&quot;.

During the Roman Empire, Aequitas as a divine personification was part of the religious propaganda of the emperor, under the name &quot;Aequitas Augusti&quot;, which also appeared on coins. She is depicted on coins holding a cornucopia and a balance scale &quot;(libra)&quot;, which was more often a symbol of &quot;honest measure&quot; to the Romans than of justice.

The bridge has a single span, wooden, double Burr arch trusses design with the addition of steel hanger rods. The deck is made from oak planks. It is painted red, the traditional color of Lancaster County covered bridges, on both the inside and outside. Both approaches to the bridge are painted in the traditional white color.

The bridge&#x27;s WGCB Number is 38-36-12. In 1980 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places as structure number 80003514. It is located at (40.20783, -76.134667) to the northeast of Ephrata, Pennsylvania off Pennsylvania Route 272 on Cocalico Creek Road.

== History ==
The Bucher&#x27;s Mill Covered Bridge was built in 1891&quot;Note:&quot; by Elias McMellen, using single span, wooden, double Burr arch truss construction, at a cost of $1167. A year later, in 1892, the bridge was damaged heavily in a flood and was rebuilt by McMellen for $1025. At only 64 feet long, it is one of the shortest covered bridges in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.

<text>In ancient Roman religion, Aeternitas was the divine personification of eternity. She was particularly associated with Imperial cult as a virtue of the deified emperor &quot;(divus)&quot;. The religious maintenance of abstract deities such as Aeternitas was characteristic of official Roman cult from the time of the Julio-Claudians to the Severans.

Like the more familiar anthropomorphic deities, Aeternitas and other abstractions were cultivated with sacrifices and temples, both in Rome and in the provinces. The temple of &quot;Aeternitas Augusta&quot; at Tarraco in Roman Spain was pictured on a coin.

The divinity sometimes appears as &quot;Aeternitas Imperii&quot; (the &quot;Eternity of Roman rule&quot;), where the Latin word &quot;imperium&quot; (&quot;command, power&quot;) points toward the meaning &quot;empire,&quot; the English word derived from it. &quot;Aeternitas Imperii&quot; was among the deities who received sacrifices from the Arval Brethren in a thanksgiving when Nero survived conspiracy and attempted assassination. New bronze coinage was issued at this time, on which various virtues were represented. Aeternitas was among the many virtues depicted on coinage issued under Vespasian, Titus, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and Septimius Severus.

The coins issued 75–79 AD under Vespasian show Aeternitas holding a head in each hand representing Sol and Luna. On the coins of Titus (80–81 AD), Aeternitas holds a cornucopia, leans on a scepter, and has one foot placed on a globe, imagery that links the concepts of eternity, prosperity, and world dominion. From the 2nd to the mid-3rd century, the iconography of Aeternitas includes the globe, celestial bodies (stars, or sun and moon), and the phoenix, a symbol of cyclical time, since the phoenix was reborn in flames every 500 years. Aeternitas sometimes holds the globe on which the phoenix perches.

In &quot;The Marriage of Philology and Mercury&quot;, Martianus Capella says that Aeternitas is among the more honored of Jupiter&#x27;s daughters. He mentions her diadem, the circular shape of which represents eternity.

The male equivalent of Aeternitas is Aion, the god of unbound time, the celestial spheres, and the Zodiac.

<text>Aius Locutius (, spoken affirmation), or Aius Loquens (, speaking affirmation), was a Roman deity or numen associated with the Gallic invasions of Rome during the early 4th century BC.

According to legend, a Roman plebeian named M. Caedicius heard a supernatural, nocturnal voice that issued from Vesta&#x27;s sacred grove, at the base of the Palatine hill. It warned him of an imminent Gaulish attack, recommended that the walls of Rome be fortified and instructed him to pass these messages on to the tribune of the plebs, but because of the messenger&#x27;s humble station, the message was ignored. In consequence, the Gauls entered and burned the city (c. 390 BC). Once the Gauls were repelled, the Senate built a temple and altar (known as &quot;Ara Aius Locutius&quot; or &quot;Ara Saepta&quot;) to propitiate the unknown deity who had offered the warning. This was said to have been set up where Caedicius had heard the divine voice. Later Roman historians disputed its exact location and no trace remains of the temple or altar; the latter has been historically misidentified with the Palatine altar inscribed &quot;si deus si dea&quot; (&quot;whether god or goddess&quot;), in cautious dedication to some unknown deity.

In the broad context of official Roman religion, Aius Locutius is exceptional. Officially, the gods might speak through the cryptic writings and utterances of specialised oracles, or through a complex system of signs in answer to the specific questions of State augurs. They might also grant signs of fortune to their most favoured protégés, or speak privately to them in dreams. Aius Locutius gave clear, urgent instructions of great importance to the State, in a voice &quot;clearer than human&quot;, but in everyday Latin, to an ordinary plebeian passer-by. Thereafter, according to Cicero, &quot;having acquired a temple, an altar, and a name, &#x27;Speaker&#x27; never spoke again&quot;. As a trained augur, Cicero was obliged to successfully identify and expiate any prodigies, including such &quot;divine noise&quot; that might signal imminent disaster or divine discontent. Beard (2012) places Aius Locutius at the &quot;extraordinary limit&quot; of such sounds, for the unequivocal clarity of the warning, and the consequences of its rejection by Roman authorities; a god &quot;defined by his voice alone&quot;.

The epithet &quot;Locutius&quot; was also used to invoke one of the deities concerned with child development.

<text>The Jackson&#x27;s Sawmill Covered Bridge or Eichelberger&#x27;s Covered Bridge is a covered bridge that spans the West Branch of the Octoraro Creek in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. A county-owned and maintained bridge, its official designation is the West Octoraro #1 Bridge. The bridge is purportedly the only covered bridge in the county that is not built perpendicular to the stream it crosses due to the placement of the sawmill on one side of the bridge and the rock formations faced by the builders on the other side.

The bridge has a single span, wooden, double Burr arch trusses design with the addition of steel hanger rods. The deck is made from oak planks. It is painted red, the traditional color of Lancaster County covered bridges, on both the inside and outside. Both approaches to the bridge are painted in the traditional white color.

The bridge&#x27;s WGCB Number is 38-36-33. In 1980 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places as structure number 80003520, but it was removed from the Register in 1986. It is located at (39.89700, -76.08000). The bridge lies in Bart Township, to the east of Quarryville and south of Pennsylvania Route 372 on Mt Pleasant Road. Due to its remote location in an isolated part of the county, it is seen less than many of the county&#x27;s other covered bridges that are closer to the major populations centers such as Lancaster.

The bridge was built in 1878 by John Smith and Samuel Stauffer at a cost of $2,410. In 1985 it was washed mostly intact from its foundations and deposited a short distance downstream in a flood. It was repaired and reset at a cost to the county of $75,000. During the rebuilding, the bridge was raised to protect it against future flooding. As of summer 2006, the bridge was in good conditions, having undergone a recent rehabilitation in May 2005.

<text>The Herr&#x27;s Mill Covered Bridge was a covered bridge that spans Pequea Creek in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is also sometimes known as Soudersburg Bridge.

The bridge had a double span, wooden, double Burr arch trusses design. It was painted red on the outside, the traditional color of Lancaster County covered bridges. Both approaches to the bridge were painted in the traditional white color.

The bridge&#x27;s WGCB Number is 38-36-21. In 1980 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places as structure number 80003537. It was located at (40.00983, -76.16217), in Paradise Township on Ronks Road 0.4 km (0.25 mi) south of U.S. Route 30 to the east of Lancaster city.

== History ==
Herr&#x27;s Mill Covered Bridge was built in 1844 by Joseph Elliot and Robert Russell at a cost of $1787. It has a double-span, double-arch Burr arch truss construction. In 1875, the bridge was rebuilt by James C. Carpenter at a cost of $1860. The bridge was later bypassed by a new concrete bridge and is now on the private property of the Mill Bridge Village Camping Resort. Owner Brian Kopan was quoted as saying &quot;The bridge is in fine condition. We’re hoping to keep it as it is.&quot; In October 2018, the bridge was dismantled and was being moved to Elizabethtown, before it fell into the creek.

<text>The Hunsecker&#x27;s Mill Covered Bridge is a covered bridge located in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, United States. The bridge has a single span, wooden, double Burr arch trusses design. The bridge, which spans the Conestoga River, is long, making it the longest single span covered bridge in the county.

The bridge&#x27;s WGCB Number is 38-36-06. Unlike most historic covered bridges in the county, it is not listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is located at (40.08717, -76.24750). The bridge is approximately one mile southeast of Pennsylvania Route 272 and is north of Pennsylvania Route 23 off Mondale Road on Hunsecker Road, just west of the community of Hunsecker. The bridge divides the road on which it is upon into Hunsecker Road (East) in Upper Leacock Township and Hunsicker Road (West) in Manheim Township.

== History ==
The original bridge was built in 1843 by John Russell at a cost of $1,988. It was and is a double Burr Arch truss system. It has been swept away in flooding numerous times, most recently in 1972 after Hurricane Agnes. Waters lifted the original structure off its abutments and carried it downstream. In 1973, following destruction from the hurricane, it was rebuilt at a cost of $321,302.&quot;Note:&quot; Its length of 180 feet makes it the longest single-span covered bridge of Lancaster County&#x27;s 28 covered bridges. While Schenck&#x27;s covered bridge (Big Chiques #4) is one of 3 bridges with horizontal siding boards, the Hunsecker&#x27;s Mill bridge may be the only one in Lancaster County with horizontal floor boards which give a unique vibration upon crossing, it is a little bumpy for cyclists at speed, proceed with some caution. A detailed scale model (~7&#x27; long), complete with stone abutments, was donated to the Lancaster Mennonite Historical Society and may be available for viewing.

<doc id="85003" wikidata="Q455503" url="?curid=85003" title="Amata">
<text>According to Roman mythology, Amata (also called Palanto) was the wife of Latinus, king of the Latins, and the mother of their only child, Lavinia. In the Aeneid of Virgil, she commits suicide during the conflict between Aeneas and Turnus over which of them would marry Lavinia.

When Aeneas asks for Lavinia&#x27;s hand, Amata objects, because she has already been promised to Turnus, the king of the Rutulians. Hiding her daughter in the woods, she enlists the other Latin women to instigate a war between the two. Turnus, and his ally Mezentius, leader of the Etruscans, are defeated by Aeneas with the assistance of the Pelasgian colonists from Arcadia and Italic natives of Pallantium, led by that city&#x27;s founder, the Arcadian Evander of Pallene. The story of this conflict fills the greater part of the seventh book of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;. When Amata believes that Turnus had fallen in battle, she hangs herself.

==In Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;==
In Canto 17 of Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Purgatorio&quot;, Amata (along with Procne and Haman) is one of the canto&#x27;s three exemplars of the sin of wrath (anger). Dante imagines a mournful Lavinia, reproaching her mother, Amata, for the grief which her suicide has inflicted. Parallels have been drawn between Dante and his representation of Amata in &quot;Purgatorio&quot;. After his exile from Florence and the Black Guelph takeover, Dante may have experienced that same self-recrimination experienced by Amata, which led to her suicide.
