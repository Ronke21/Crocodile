<text>Logistics is the part of supply chain management that deals with the efficient forward and reverse flow of goods, services, and related information from the point of origin to the point of consumption according to the needs of customers. Logistics management is a component that holds the supply chain together. The resources managed in logistics may include tangible goods such as materials, equipment, and supplies, as well as food and other consumable items.

In military logistics, it is concerned with maintaining army supply lines with food, armaments, ammunition, and spare parts apart from the transportation of troops themselves. Meanwhile, civil logistics deals with acquiring, moving, and storing raw materials, semi-finished goods, and finished goods. For organisations that provide garbage collection, mail deliveries, public utilities, and after-sales services, logistical problems must be addressed.

Logistics deals with the movements of materials or products from one facility to another; it does not include material flow within the production or assembly plants, such as production planning or single-machine scheduling. Logistics occupies a significant amount of the operational cost of an organisation or country. Logistical costs of organizations in the United States incurred about 11% of the United States national gross domestic product (GDP) as of 1997. In the European Union, logistics costs were 8.8% to 11.5% of GDP as of 1993.

Dedicated simulation software can model, analyze, visualize, and optimize logistics&#x27; complexity. Minimizing resource use is a common motivation in all logistics fields. A professional working in logistics management is called a logistician.

== Nomenclature ==

The term &quot;&quot; is attested in English from 1846, and is from , where it was either coined or popularized by Swiss military officer and writer Antoine-Henri Jomini, who defined it in his &quot;Summary of the Art of War&quot; (). The term appears in the 1830 edition, then titled &quot;Analytic Table&quot; (&quot;Tableau Analytique&quot;), and Jomini explains that it is derived from (cognate to English ), in the terms and :
The term is credited to Jomini, and the term and its etymology criticized by Georges de Chambray in 1832, writing:
Chambray also notes that the term was present in the &quot;Dictionnaire de l&#x27;Académie française&quot; as a synonym for algebra.

The is a homonym of the existing mathematical term, from , a traditional division of Greek mathematics; the mathematical term is presumably the origin of the term &quot;logistic&quot; in logistic growth and related terms. Some sources give this instead as the source of &quot;logistics&quot;, either ignorant of Jomini&#x27;s statement that it was derived from , or dubious and instead believing it was in fact of Greek origin, or influenced by the existing term of Greek origin.

== Definition ==
Jomini originally defined logistics as:
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; defines logistics as &quot;the branch of military science relating to procuring, maintaining and transporting material, personnel and facilities&quot;. However, the &quot;New Oxford American Dictionary&quot; defines logistics as &quot;the detailed coordination of a complex operation involving many people, facilities, or supplies&quot;, and the Oxford Dictionary on-line defines it as &quot;the detailed organization and implementation of a complex operation&quot;. As such, logistics is commonly seen as a branch of engineering that creates &quot;people systems&quot; rather than &quot;machine systems&quot;.

According to the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals (previously the Council of Logistics Management), logistics is the process of planning, implementing and controlling procedures for the efficient and effective
transportation and storage of goods including services and related information from the point of origin to the point of consumption for the purpose of conforming to customer requirements and includes inbound, outbound, internal and external movements.

Academics and practitioners traditionally refer to the terms operations or production management when referring to physical transformations taking place in a single business location (factory, restaurant or even bank clerking) and reserve the term logistics for activities related to distribution, that is, moving products on the territory. Managing a distribution center is seen, therefore, as pertaining to the realm of logistics since, while in theory, the products made by a factory are ready for consumption they still need to be moved along the distribution network according to some logic, and the distribution center aggregates and processes orders coming from different areas of the territory. That being said, from a modeling perspective, there are similarities between operations management and logistics, and companies sometimes use hybrid professionals, with for example a &quot;Director of Operations&quot; or a &quot;Logistics Officer&quot; working on similar problems. Furthermore, the term &quot;supply chain management&quot; originally referred to, among other issues, having an integrated vision of both production and logistics from point of origin to point of production. All these terms may suffer from semantic change as a side effect of advertising.

== Logistics activities ==


Logistical activities can be divided into three main areas: order processing, inventory management, and freight transportation. Traditionally, order processing was a time-consuming activity that could take up to 70% of the order-cycle time. However, with new technologies such as bar code scanning, computers, and network connection, customer orders can quickly reach the seller in no time, and the availability of stocks can be checked in real time. The purpose of having an inventory is to reduce the overall logistical cost while improving service to customers. Having a stockpile of finished goods beforehand can reduce the frequency of transportation to and from the customers and cope with the randomness of customer demands. However, maintaining an inventory requires capital investment in finished goods and maintaining a warehouse. Storage and order picking occupy most of the warehouse maintenance cost. Freight transportation forms a vital part of logistics and allows access to broad markets as goods can be transported to hundreds or thousands of kilometers away. Freight transportation accounts for two-thirds of logistical costs and significantly impacts customer service. Transportation policies and warehouse management are closely intertwined.

The rise of commercial transactions through the internet gives rise to the need for &quot;e-logistics&quot;. Compared to traditional logistics, e-logistics handles parcels valued at less than a hundred US dollars to customers scattered at various destinations worldwide. In e-logistics, customers&#x27; demands come in waves when compared to traditional logistics, where the demand is consistent.

Inbound logistics is one of the primary logistics processes concentrating on purchasing and arranging the inbound movement of materials, parts, or unfinished inventory from suppliers to manufacturing or assembly plants, warehouses, or retail stores.

Outbound logistics is the process related to the storage and movement of the final product. The related information flows from the end of the production line to the end user.

Given the services performed by logisticians, the main fields of logistics can be broken down as follows:
* Procurement logistics
* Distribution logistics
* After-sales logistics
* Disposal logistics
* Reverse logistics
* Green logistics
* Global logistics
* Domestics logistics
* Concierge service
* Reliability, availability, and maintainability
* Asset control logistics
* Point-of-sale material logistics
* Emergency logistics
* Production logistics
* Construction logistics
* Capital project logistics
* Digital logistics
* Humanitarian logistics
Procurement logistics consists of market research, requirements planning, make-or-buy decisions, supplier management, ordering, and order control. The targets in procurement logistics might be contradictory: maximizing efficiency by concentrating on core competencies, outsourcing while maintaining the company&#x27;s autonomy, or minimizing procurement costs while maximizing security within the supply process.

Advance logistics consists of the activities required to set up or establish a plan for logistics activities to occur.

Global logistics is technically the process of managing the &quot;flow&quot; of goods through a supply chain from its place of production to other parts of the world. This often requires an intermodal transport system via ocean, air, rail, and truck. The effectiveness of global logistics is measured in the Logistics Performance Index.

Distribution logistics has, as its main task, the delivery of the finished products to the customer. It consists of order processing, warehousing, and transportation. Distribution logistics is necessary because production time, place, and quantity differ with the time, place, and quantity of consumption.

Disposal logistics has the main function of reducing logistics cost(s) and enhancing service(s) related to the disposal of waste produced during a business&#x27;s operation.

Reverse logistics denotes all those reusing products and materials operations. The reverse logistics process includes the management and the sale of surpluses, as well as products being returned to vendors from buyers. It is &quot;the process of planning, implementing, and controlling the efficient, cost-effective flow of raw materials, in-process inventory, finished goods, and related information from the point of consumption to the point of origin to recapture value or proper disposal.&quot; More precisely, reverse logistics moves goods from their typical final destination to capture value or proper disposal. The opposite of reverse logistics is forward logistics.

&quot;&#x27;Green logistics&quot; describes all attempts to measure and minimize the ecological impact of logistics activities, including all activities of the forward and reverse flows. This can be achieved through intermodal freight transport, path optimization, vehicle saturation, and city logistics.

RAM logistics (see also Logistic engineering) combines both &quot;business logistics&quot; and &quot;military logistics&quot; since it concerns highly complicated technological systems for which reliability, availability and maintainability are essential, e.g., weapon system and military supercomputers.

Asset control logistics: companies in the retail channels, both organized retailers and suppliers, often deploy assets required for the display, preservation, and promotion of their products. Some examples are refrigerators, stands, display monitors, seasonal equipment, poster stands &amp; frames.

Emergency logistics (or humanitarian logistics) is a term used by the logistics, supply chain, and manufacturing industries to denote specific time-critical modes of transport used to move goods rapidly in the event of an emergency. The reason for enlisting emergency logistics services could be a production delay or anticipated production delay, or an urgent need for specialized equipment to prevent events such as aircraft being grounded (also known as &quot;aircraft on ground&quot;—AOG), ships being delayed, or telecommunications failure. Humanitarian logistics involves governments, the military, aid agencies, donors, non-governmental organizations, and emergency logistics services are typically sourced from a specialist provider.

The term production logistics describes logistic processes within a value-adding system (ex, a factory or a mine). Production logistics aims to ensure that each machine and workstation receives the right product in the correct quantity and quality at the right time. The concern is with production, testing, transportation, storage, and supply. Production logistics can operate in existing as well as new plants. Since manufacturing in an existing plant is a constantly changing process, machines are exchanged and new ones added, which allows for improving the production logistics system accordingly. Production logistics provides the means to achieve customer response and capital efficiency. Production logistics becomes more important with decreasing batch sizes. In many industries (e.g. mobile phones), the short-term goal is a batch size of one, allowing even a single customer&#x27;s demand to be fulfilled efficiently. Track and tracing, which is an essential part of production logistics due to product safety and reliability issues, is also gaining importance, especially in the automotive and medical industries.

Construction logistics has been employed by civilizations for thousands of years as the various human civilizations tried to build the best possible works of construction for living and protection. Now, construction logistics has emerged as a vital part of construction. In the past few years, construction logistics has emerged as a different field of knowledge and study within supply chain management and logistics.

== Seven R&#x27;s ==

The Seven R&#x27;s is a popular concept used to enforce best practices in logistics management which consists of the following:

* Right product (including the right information about it)
* (At) right quantity
* Right time
* Right condition
* Right place
* (to) the right customer
* (with the) right (financial) resources

== Military logistics ==
In military science, maintaining one&#x27;s supply lines while disrupting those of the enemy is a crucial—some would say the most crucial—element of military strategy, since an armed force without resources and transportation is defenseless. The historical leaders Hannibal, Alexander the Great, and the Duke of Wellington are considered to have been logistical geniuses: Alexander&#x27;s expedition benefited considerably from his meticulous attention to the provisioning of his army, Hannibal is credited to have &quot;taught logistics&quot; to the Romans during the Punic Wars and the success of the Anglo-Portuguese army in the Peninsula War was due to the effectiveness of Wellington&#x27;s supply system, despite the numerical disadvantage. The defeat of the British in the American War of Independence and the defeat of the Axis in the African theater of World War II are attributed by some scholars to logistical failures.

Militaries have a significant need for logistics solutions and so have developed advanced implementations. Integrated logistics support (ILS) is a discipline used in military industries to ensure an easily supportable system with a robust customer service (logistic) concept at the lowest cost and in line with (often high) reliability, availability, maintainability, and other requirements, as defined for the project.

In military logistics, Logistics Officers manage how and when to move resources to the places they are needed.

Supply chain management in military logistics often deals with a number of variables in predicting cost, deterioration, consumption, and future demand. The United States Armed Forces&#x27; categorical supply classification was developed in such a way that categories of supply with similar consumption variables are grouped together for planning purposes. For instance, peacetime consumption of ammunition and fuel will be considerably lower than wartime consumption of these items, whereas other classes of supply such as subsistence and clothing have a relatively consistent consumption rate regardless of war or peace.

Some classes of supply have a linear demand relationship: as more troops are added, more supply items are needed; or as more equipment is used, more fuel and ammunition are consumed. Other classes of supply must consider a third variable besides usage and quantity: time. As equipment ages, more and more repair parts are needed over time, even when usage and quantity stay consistent. By recording and analyzing these trends over time and applying them to future scenarios, the US Armed Forces can accurately supply troops with the items necessary at the precise moment they are needed. History has shown that good logistical planning creates a lean and efficient fighting force. The lack thereof can lead to a clunky, slow, and ill-equipped force with too much or too little supply.

== Business logistics ==
One definition of business logistics speaks of &quot;having the right item in the right quantity at the right time at the right place for the right price in the right condition to the right customer&quot;. Business logistics incorporates all industry sectors and aims to manage the fruition of project life cycles, supply chains, and resultant efficiencies.

The term &quot;business logistics&quot; has evolved since the 1960s due to the increasing complexity of supplying businesses with materials and shipping out products in an increasingly globalized supply chain, leading to a call for professionals called supply chain logisticians.

In business, logistics may have either an internal focus (inbound logistics) or an external focus (outbound logistics), covering the flow and storage of materials from point of origin to point of consumption, a key factor in supply-chain management. The main functions of a qualified logistician include inventory management, purchasing, transportation, warehousing, consultation, and the organizing and planning of these activities. Logisticians combine professional knowledge of each of these functions to coordinate resources in an organization.

There are two fundamentally different forms of logistics: one optimizes a steady flow of material through a network of transport links and storage nodes, while the other coordinates a sequence of resources to carry out some project, such as restructuring a warehouse.

=== Nodes of a distribution network ===
A distribution network would require several intermediaries to bring consumer or industrial goods from manufacturers to a user. Intermediaries would markup the costs of the products during distribution, but benefit users by providing lower transportation costs than the manufacturers. The number of intermediaries required for the distribution network depends upon the types of goods being distributed. For example, consumer goods such as cosmetics and handicrafts may not require any intermediaries as they can be sold door-to-door or can be obtained from local flea markets. For industrial goods such as raw materials and equipment, intermediaries are not needed because manufacturers can sell a large number of goods to a user. Generally, there are three types of intermediaries, namely: agent/broker, wholesaler, and retailer.

The nodes of a distribution network include:
* Factories where products are manufactured or assembled
* A depot or deposit, a standard type of warehouse for storing merchandise (high level of inventory)
* Distribution centers for order processing and order fulfillment (lower level of inventory) and also for receiving returning items from clients. Typically, distribution centers are way stations for products to be disbursed further down the supply chain. They usually do not ship inventory directly to customers, whereas fulfillment centers do.
* Transit points for cross-docking activities, which consist of reassembling cargo units based on deliveries scheduled (only moving merchandise)
* Traditional &quot;mom-and-pop&quot; retail stores, modern supermarkets, hypermarkets, discount stores or also voluntary chains, consumers&#x27; co-operatives, groups of consumers with collective buying power. Note that subsidiaries will be mostly owned by another company and franchisers, although using other company brands, actually own the point of sale.

=== Logistic families and metrics ===
A logistic family is a set of products that share a common characteristic: weight and volumetric characteristics, physical storing needs (temperature, radiation, etc.), handling needs, order frequency, package size, etc. The following metrics may be used by the company to organize its products in different families:
* Physical metrics used to evaluate inventory systems include stocking capacity, selectivity, superficial use, volumetric use, transport capacity, transport capacity use.
* Monetary metrics used include space holding costs, such as building, shelving, and services, and handling costs, such as people, handling machinery, energy, and maintenance.

Other metrics may present themselves in both physical or monetary form, such as the standard inventory turnover.

=== Handling and order processing ===

Unit loads are combinations of individual items which are moved by handling systems, usually employing a pallet of normed dimensions.

Handling systems include: trans-pallet handlers, counterweight handler, retractable mast handler, bilateral handlers, trilateral handlers, AGV and other handlers.

Storage systems include: pile stocking, cell racks (either static or movable), cantilever racks and gravity racks.

Order processing is a sequential process involving: processing withdrawal list, picking (selective removal of items from loading units), sorting (assembling items based on the destination), package formation (weighting, labeling, and packing), order consolidation (gathering packages into loading units for transportation, control and bill of lading).

Picking can be both manual or automated. Manual picking can be both man-to-goods, i.e. operator using a cart or conveyor belt, or goods-to-man, i.e. the operator benefiting from the presence of a mini-load ASRS, vertical or horizontal carousel or from an Automatic Vertical Storage System (AVSS). Automatic picking is done either with dispensers or depalletizing robots.

Sorting can be done manually through carts or conveyor belts, or automatically through sorters.

=== Transportation ===

Consolidating small shipments into large shipments can help to save transportation costs. There are three methods to do this: facility consolidation, multi-stop consolidation, and temporal consolidation. Facility consolidation uses the economics of scale by transporting small shipments over short distances and large shipments over long distances. Multi-stop consolidation makes multiple stops to consolidate small shipments in the case of less-than-truckload shipping. Temporal consolidation adjusts the shipping schedules forwards or backward so as to make a single large shipment rather than several small shipments over time.

Cargo can be consolidated into pallets or containers. There are five basic modes of transport, namely, ship, rail, truck, air, and pipeline operated by different carrier. These shipping methods can be combined in various ways such as intermodal transport (no handling), multimodal transport, and combined transport (minimal road transport). A shipper chooses a carrier by taking into account the total cost of shipment and transit time. Air is the most expensive type of transport, followed by truck, rail, pipeline, and ship.

Cargo can be organized in different shipment categories. Unit loads are usually assembled into higher standardized units such as: ISO containers, swap bodies or semi-trailers. Especially for very long distances, product transportation will likely benefit from using different transportation means: When moving cargo, typical constraints are maximum weight and volume.

Operators involved in transportation include: all train, road vehicles, boats, airplanes companies, couriers, freight forwarders and multi-modal transport operators.

Merchandise being transported internationally is usually subject to the Incoterms standards issued by the International Chamber of Commerce.

=== Configuration and management ===
In the logistics business, a logistical system is designed at a minimum cost based on the expected customer service level. As the service improves, the number of sales also increased. As service is further improved, more sales are captured from competing providers. Further increase in customer service levels after these only increases sales marginally.

Similarly to production systems, logistic systems need to be properly configured and managed. Actually a number of methodologies have been directly borrowed from operations management such as using Economic Order Quantity models for managing inventory in the nodes of the network. Distribution resource planning (DRP) is similar to MRP, except that it does not concern activities inside the nodes of the network but planning distribution when moving goods through the links of the network.

Traditionally in logistics, configuration may be at the level of the warehouse (node) or at level of the distribution system (network).

Regarding a single warehouse, besides the issue of designing and building the warehouse, configuration means solving a number of interrelated technical-economic problems: dimensioning rack cells, choosing a palletizing method (manual or through robots), rack dimensioning and design, number of racks, number and typology of retrieval systems (e.g. stacker cranes). Some important constraints have to be satisfied: fork and load beams resistance to bending and proper placement of sprinklers. Although picking is more of a tactical planning decision than a configuration problem, it is important to take it into account when deciding the layout of the racks inside the warehouse and buying tools such as handlers and motorized carts since once those decisions are taken they will work as constraints when managing the warehouse, the same reasoning for sorting when designing the conveyor system or installing automatic dispensers.

Configuration at the level of the distribution system concerns primarily the problem of location of the nodes in geographic space and distribution of capacity among the nodes. The first may be referred to as facility location (with the special case of site selection) while the latter to as capacity allocation. The problem of outsourcing typically arises at this level: the nodes of a supply chain are very rarely owned by a single enterprise. Distribution networks can be characterized by numbers of levels, namely the number of intermediary nodes between supplier and consumer:
* Direct store delivery, i.e. zero levels
* One level network: central warehouse
* Two level network: central and peripheral warehouses

This distinction is more useful for modeling purposes, but it relates also to a tactical decision regarding safety stocks: considering a two-level network, if safety inventory is kept only in peripheral warehouses then it is called a dependent system (from suppliers), if safety inventory is distributed among central and peripheral warehouses it is called an independent system (from suppliers). Transportation from producer to the second level is called primary transportation, from the second level to a consumer is called secondary transportation.

Although configuring a distribution network from zero is possible, logisticians usually have to deal with restructuring existing networks due to presence of an array of factors: changing demand, product or process innovation, opportunities for outsourcing, change of government policy toward trade barriers, innovation in transportation means (both vehicles or thoroughfares), the introduction of regulations (notably those regarding pollution) and availability of ICT supporting systems, such as ERP or e-commerce.

Once a logistic system is configured, management, meaning tactical decisions, takes place, once again, at the level of the warehouse and of the distribution network. Decisions have to be made under a set of constraints: internal, such as using the available infrastructure, or external, such as complying with the given product shelf lifes and expiration dates.

At the warehouse level, the logistician must decide how to distribute merchandise over the racks. Three basic situations are traditionally considered: shared storage, dedicated storage (rack space reserved for specific merchandise) and class-based storage (class meaning merchandise organized in different areas according to their access index).

Picking efficiency varies greatly depending on the situation. For a man to goods situation, a distinction is carried out between high-level picking (vertical component significant) and low-level picking (vertical component insignificant). A number of tactical decisions regarding picking must be made:
* Routing path: standard alternatives include transversal routing, return routing, midpoint routing, and largest gap return routing
* Replenishment method: standard alternatives include equal space supply for each product class and equal time supply for each product class.
* Picking logic: order picking vs batch picking

At the level of the distribution network, tactical decisions involve mainly inventory control and delivery path optimization. Note that the logistician may be required to manage the reverse flow along with the forward flow.

=== Warehouse management system and control ===

Warehouse management systems (WMS) can differ significantly from warehouse control systems (WCS), although there is some overlap in functionality. A WMS plans a weekly activity forecast based on such factors as statistics and trends, whereas a WCS acts like a floor supervisor, working in real-time to get the job done by the most effective means. For example, a WMS can tell the system that it is going to need five of stock-keeping unit (SKU) A and five of SKU B hours in advance, but by the time it acts, other considerations may have come into play or there could be a logjam on a conveyor. A WCS can prevent that problem by working in real-time and adapting to the situation by making a last-minute decision based on current activity and operational status. Working synergistically, WMS and WCS can resolve these issues and maximize efficiency for companies that rely on the effective operation of their warehouse or distribution center.

=== Logistics outsourcing ===
Logistics outsourcing involves a relationship between a company and an LSP (logistic service provider), which, compared with basic logistics services, has more customized offerings, encompasses a broad number of service activities, is characterized by a long-term orientation, and thus has a strategic nature.

Outsourcing does not have to be complete externalization to an LSP, but can also be partial:
* A single contract for supplying a specific service on occasion
* Creation of a spin-off
* Creation of a joint venture

Third-party logistics (3PL) involves using external organizations to execute logistics activities that have traditionally been performed within an organization itself. According to this definition, third-party logistics includes any form of outsourcing of logistics activities previously performed in house. For example, if a company with its own warehousing facilities decides to employ external transportation, this would be an example of third-party logistics. Logistics is an emerging business area in many countries. External 3PL providers have evolved from merely providing logistics capabilities to becoming real orchestrators of supply chains that create and sustain a competitive advantage, thus bringing about new levels of logistics outsourcing.

The concept of a fourth-party logistics (4PL) provider was first defined by Andersen Consulting (now Accenture) as an integrator that assembles the resources, planning capabilities, and technology of its own organization and other organizations to design, build, and run comprehensive supply chain solutions. Whereas a third-party logistics (3PL) service provider targets a single function, a 4PL targets management of the entire process. Some have described a 4PL as a general contractor that manages other 3PLs, truckers, forwarders, custom house agents, and others, essentially taking responsibility of a complete process for the customer.

=== Horizontal alliances between logistics service providers ===

Horizontal business alliances often occur between logistics service providers, i.e., the cooperation between two or more logistics companies that are potentially competing. In a horizontal alliance, these partners can benefit twofold. On one hand, they can &quot;access tangible resources which are directly exploitable&quot;. In this example extending common transportation networks, their warehouse infrastructure and the ability to provide more complex service packages can be achieved by combining resources. On the other hand, partners can &quot;access intangible resources, which are not directly exploitable&quot;. This typically includes know-how and information and, in turn, innovation.

== Logistics automation ==
Logistics automation is the application of computer software or automated machinery to improve the efficiency of logistics operations. This typically refers to operations within a warehouse or distribution center with broader tasks undertaken by supply chain engineering systems and enterprise resource planning systems.

Industrial machinery can typically identify products through either barcode or RFID technologies. Information in traditional bar codes is stored as a sequence of black and white bars varying in width, which when read by laser is translated into a digital sequence, which according to fixed rules can be converted into a decimal number or other data. Sometimes information in a bar code can be transmitted through radio frequency, more typically radio transmission is used in RFID tags. An RFID tag is a card containing a memory chip and an antenna that transmits signals to a reader. RFID may be found on merchandise, animals, vehicles, and people as well.

== Logistics: profession and organizations ==
A logistician is a professional logistics practitioner. Professional logisticians are often certified by professional associations. One can either work in a pure logistics company, such as a shipping line, airport, or freight forwarder, or within the logistics department of a company. However, as mentioned above, logistics is a broad field, encompassing procurement, production, distribution, and disposal activities. Hence, career perspectives are broad as well.
A new trend in the industry is the 4PL, or fourth-party logistics, firms, consulting companies offering logistics services.

Some universities and academic institutions train students as logisticians, offering undergraduate and postgraduate programs. A university with a primary focus on logistics is Kühne Logistics University in Hamburg, Germany. It is non-profit and supported by Kühne-Foundation of the logistics entrepreneur Klaus Michael Kühne.

The Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT), established in the United Kingdom in 1919, received a Royal Charter in 1926. The Chartered Institute is one of the professional bodies or institutions for the logistics and transport sectors that offer professional qualifications or degrees in logistics management. CILT programs can be studied at centers around the UK, some of which also offer distance learning options. The institute also have overseas branches namely The Chartered Institute of Logistics &amp; Transport Australia (CILTA) in Australia and Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport in Hong Kong (CILTHK) in Hong Kong. In the UK, Logistics Management programs are conducted by many universities and professional bodies such as CILT. These programs are generally offered at the postgraduate level.

The Global Institute of Logistics established in New York in 2003 is a think tank for the profession and is primarily concerned with intercontinental maritime logistics. It is particularly concerned with container logistics and the role of the seaport authority in the maritime logistics chain.

The International Association of Public Health Logisticians (IAPHL) is a professional network that promotes the professional development of supply chain managers and others working in the field of public health logistics and commodity security, with particular focus on developing countries. The association supports logisticians worldwide by providing a community of practice, where members can network, exchange ideas, and improve their professional skills.

=== Logistics museums ===
There are many museums in the world which cover various aspects of practical logistics. These include museums of transportation, customs, packing, and industry-based logistics. However, only the following museums are fully dedicated to logistics:

&quot;General logistics&quot;
* Logistics Museum (Saint Petersburg, Russia)
* Museum of Logistics (Tokyo, Japan)
* Beijing Wuzi University Logistics Museum (Beijing, China)

&quot;Military logistics&quot;
* Royal Logistic Corps Museum (Hampshire, England, United Kingdom)
* The Canadian Forces Logistics Museum (Montreal, Quebec, Canada)
* Logistics Museum (Hanoi, Vietnam)

<doc id="77548" wikidata="Q977528" url="?curid=77548" title="Duck family (Disney)">
<text>The Duck family is a fictional family of cartoon ducks related to Disney character Donald Duck. The family is also related to the Coot, Goose, and Gander families, as well as the Scottish Clan McDuck. Besides Donald, the best-known members of the Duck family are Huey, Dewey, and Louie, Donald&#x27;s triplet nephews.

Members of the Duck family appear most extensively in Donald Duck comics (although some have made animated appearances). In 1993, American comics author Don Rosa published a &quot;Duck Family Tree&quot; that established the characters&#x27; relationships in his stories. He also created a fictional timeline for when certain characters were born (All birth/death dates given below are Rosa&#x27;s). Other comics authors both before and after have shown variations in the family.

==Development==

In the early 1950s Carl Barks was in his second decade of creating comic book stories starring Donald Duck and his various relatives. He had personally created several of the latter, such as Scrooge McDuck (Donald&#x27;s uncle) and Gladstone Gander (Donald&#x27;s cousin). To better define their relations, Barks created a family tree, wherein he added several previously unknown relatives to fill in the gaps. Barks never intended to publish this family tree and created it only for personal reference.

The first public attempt at a coherent biography of the Ducks was published in 1974. &quot;An Informal Biography of Scrooge McDuck&quot; by science fiction author Jack Chalker used names and events in the Barks stories (and a very few non-Barks ones) to create a life story for Scrooge. It provided the basis for a Scrooge McDuck biography included in &quot;The People&#x27;s Almanac&quot;.

In 1981, Barks was well into his retirement, but his stories remained popular and had gained him unexpected fame. He had given several interviews and answered questions about his personal views on the characters and their stories. Among other subjects, Barks described his early version of the family tree. Rough sketches of the tree were published in a number of fanzines and were appreciated by fans for the authoritative background information this provided. At this point, Mark Worden decided to create a drawing of Barks&#x27; Duck Family Tree, including portraits of the characters mentioned. Otherwise, Worden made few changes, most notably adding Daisy Duck as Donald&#x27;s main love interest. His illustrated version of the tree was first published in several fanzines and later in The Carl Barks Library.

In 1987, Don Rosa, a long-time fan of Barks and personal friend of Mark Worden, started creating his own stories featuring Scrooge McDuck and his kin. Rosa&#x27;s stories contained numerous references to Barks&#x27; stories and introduced original background information. After several years, Rosa gained a large international fanbase of his own. In the early 1990s, Egmont (the publishing house employing Don Rosa after Gladstone Publishing&#x27;s initial run), offered him an ambitious assignment — to create the definitive version of Scrooge&#x27;s biography and a family tree accompanying it. This was supposed to decisively put an end to decades of seeming contradictions between stories by different authors, which had caused confusion to readers. The project was to become the award-winning, &quot;The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck&quot;, a chronology of epic proportions that spawned numerous other timeline stories, collected in a companion volume. Rosa&#x27;s &quot;Duck Family Tree&quot; accompanying the series was first published in Norway on July 3, 1993.

In the process of working on Scrooge&#x27;s biography, Rosa studied Barks&#x27; old stories mentioning his past. Then he added several ideas of his own. Among them were biographical information for Scrooge&#x27;s supporting cast, as well as designing characters in the family that had only been mentioned by Barks, such as Donald&#x27;s sister Della and Scrooge&#x27;s parents, sisters and uncles.

==Family tree by Carl Barks==
The family tree below shows the Goose (left) and Duck (right) portions of Donald&#x27;s family tree according to Carl Barks. The chart is based on a 1950s sketch made by Barks for personal use, which was later illustrated by artist Mark Worden in 1981.





==Family tree by Don Rosa==
In 1993, Don Rosa published his version of the Duck family tree as part of his 12-part comics series &quot;The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck&quot;. The most significant change was Rosa&#x27;s expansion of the family tree to include the Coot relatives. Rosa also added Goostave Gander as the father of Gladstone, and made Luke Goose the father of Gus, rather than his uncle.

The chart below is Rosa&#x27;s tree, which shows relationships within the Coot family (left) and Duck family (right).





==Ancestors==
===Andold &quot;Wild Duck&quot; Temerary===
Andold &quot;Wild Duck&quot; () was created by Gaudenzio Capelli and Marco Rota and appears in stories set in the Middle Ages. His first appearance was in &quot;Paperino e il piccolo Krack&quot; (&quot;Donald Duck and the Little Krack&quot;), published in &quot;Almanacco Topolino&quot; #228 (Dec 1975). He is a lookalike and ancestor to Donald Duck. Andold was a commander who protected the shores of Caledonia (Scotland) from Vikings. He has a girlfriend named Aydis who looks like Daisy Duck, and he also has five soldiers, two of them are named Little Bo and Big Brutus.

Andold wears a helmet, topped with a miniature decoration representing his own face. As a comical touch, the decoration&#x27;s facial expression always matches Andold&#x27;s own, changing between panels if necessary.

In the first Andold story (&quot;Paperino e il piccolo Krack&quot; from 1975), Donald dreams about Andold, in the second (&quot;Le avventure di Mac Paperin: L&#x27;arrosto della salvezza&quot; from 1980, published in the United States as &quot;Donald Duck and his fierce ancestor... Andold Wild Duck&quot;), Huey, Dewey, and Louie are reading a book about his adventures. In later Andold stories, the modern-day Ducks do not appear. All Andold Wild Duck stories are illustrated by Marco Rota, most of them are also written by him.

The first Andold comic to be published in English was &quot;Donald Duck... and his fierce ancestor... Andold Wild Duck&quot; by Rota, published in a December 1993 edition of &quot;Donald Duck Adventures&quot; with cover illustration by Don Rosa featuring Andold.

The names Andold and Aydis are anagrams of Donald and Daisy.

===Pintail Duck===
Pintail Duck was a 16th-century Duck relative and the first early ancestor to appear in the comics (in Barks&#x27; 1956 story, &quot;Back to Long Ago&quot;). Pintail served in the Royal Navy as the boatswain aboard HMS &quot;Falcon Rover&quot;. The &quot;Falcon Rover&quot; raided Spanish targets in the Caribbean Sea between 1563 and 1564 when the ship was sunk. Pintail was friends with the ship&#x27;s first mate, Malcom &quot;Matey&quot; McDuck, who was a mutual ancestor of Donald and Scrooge.

===Don de Pato===
Don de Pato was a 16th-century Spanish ancestor of Donald through both the Coot family and Clan McDuck, first appearing in the 1965 comic &quot;The Golden Galleon&quot; written by Carl Fallberg with art by Tony Strobl. He was a member of the Spanish Armada.

In the TV series &quot;Legend of the Three Caballeros&quot;, he appears under the name Don Dugo (used previously in German and Dutch translations of the comic), as one of the members of the original Three Caballeros, along with the ancestors of José Carioca and Panchito Pistoles.

===Seth Duck===
Seth Duck was an ancestor of Donald&#x27;s, considered a hero after warning Duckburg of an impending Native American attack. His statue exists in Duckburg&#x27;s Park. He appeared in the 1967 comic &quot;The Clock Plot&quot; by Vic Lockman and Tony Strobl.

==First generation==
===Humperdink Duck===
Humperdink Duck is the earliest known contemporary Duck family member. He is the husband of Elvira Coot, known to the family as &quot;Grandma Duck&quot;, and the father of Quackmore (Donald&#x27;s father), Eider, and Daphne Duck (Gladstone&#x27;s mother). Humperdink is father-in-law to Scrooge&#x27;s sister Hortense (Donald&#x27;s mother) who married his son Quackmore. He is Donald&#x27;s paternal grandfather and the maternal great-grandfather of Huey, Dewey, and Louie, through their mother Della (Donald&#x27;s twin sister). Humperdink worked as a farmer in rural Duckburg. Don Rosa gave the character relevant appearances in two stories, &quot;The Invader Of Fort Duckburg&quot;, a chapter of the saga &quot;The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck&quot;, and &quot;The Sign Of The Triple Distelfink&quot;. In the family, he was known as &quot;Pa Duck&quot;, and later as &quot;Grandpa Duck&quot;.

Humperdink&#x27;s life before having a family was never shown in the comics. Don Rosa speculated that the Duck family originated from England, but it is unknown if Humperdink is an immigrant.

In the story &quot;The Good Old Daze&quot; by Tony Strobl, Grandpa Duck (an older Humperdink) appears in a flashback scene taking care of little Donald along with Grandma, where he is portrayed as a dedicated but rigorous grandfather. Grandpa Duck&#x27;s real name was not revealed in this story, but in an untitled story from 1951, an old lover of Grandma called Humperdink has a cameo appearance. Don Rosa considered that this character became Donald&#x27;s paternal grandfather. In &quot;The Good Old Daze&quot;, artist Tony Strobl drew Grandpa Duck with a long beard and some hair, while Rosa has depicted him with a short beard and a full head of hair. In the Danish story &quot;The Good Neighbors&quot; (part of the series, &quot;Tamers of Nonhuman Threats&quot;), by writer Lars Jensen and artist Flemming Andersen, Strobl&#x27;s version of Grandpa Duck appears in a flashback scene that is told by his wife Grandma Duck. He also appears unnamed in the 1955 film &quot;No Hunting&quot;, in which he posthumously inspires Donald to take part in hunting season.

===Grandma Duck===
Elvira &quot;Grandma&quot; Duck (née Coot, October c. 1855) is Donald&#x27;s paternal grandmother and the Duck family matriarch. In most stories, she is simply referred to as &quot;Grandma Duck&quot;. She was introduced to the Disney comic universe by Al Taliaferro and Bob Karp in the &quot;Donald Duck&quot; newspaper comic strip, first in a picture on the wall in the August 11, 1940, Sunday page, and then as a full-fledged character in the strip on Monday, September 27, 1943. Taliaferro found inspiration for her in his own mother-in-law, Donnie M. Wheaton. Depending on the writer, Grandma Duck has had various given names over the years. In a story by Riley Thomson from 1950, she was named &quot;Elviry&quot; and in a story from 1953 she was given the name &quot;Abigail&quot;. Don Rosa later gave her the name &quot;Elvira&quot; in his comic books series &quot;The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck&quot;.

According to artist/writer Don Rosa, Grandma was born around 1855. In the comic strips by Taliaferro and Karp, it is mentioned that in her youth she was a pioneer in the American migration to the west, riding a covered wagon and participating in many Indian Wars. Later, she married Humperdink Duck, and they had three children named Quackmore (Donald&#x27;s father), Daphne (Gladstone&#x27;s mother) and Eider (Fethry&#x27;s father in the non-Barks duck universe). Grandma Duck helped to raise her great-grandsons, Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck (her daughter-in-law Hortense&#x27;s grandsons and granddaughter Della&#x27;s sons). In most comic book stories, as well as other media that handles Donald Duck&#x27;s childhood, it was Grandma Duck who filled the role of Donald&#x27;s caretaker.

Grandma made her animated debut in the 1960 &quot;Wonderful World of Color&quot; episode &quot;This is Your Life, Donald Duck&quot;, where she was voiced by June Foray. The episode depicted her great difficulty in raising Donald, a strong-willed and ill-tempered duckling from the moment he was hatched. She also made a brief appearance in &quot;Sport Goofy in Soccermania&quot; she was now voiced by Russi Taylor, a non-speaking cameo in &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;, and can be spotted in the background of the &quot;DuckTales&quot; episode &quot;Horse Scents&quot;.

==Second generation==
===Quackmore Duck===
Quackmore Duck (born 1875) is the father of Donald Duck, and has been variously depicted with or without a moustache. His parents are Humperdink and Elvira &quot;Grandma&quot; Duck. He was born in Duckburg, and from and early age displayed a heavy temper. He worked at his parents&#x27; farm until 1902 when he met Hortense McDuck and they became engaged. He started working for her brother Scrooge McDuck.

By 1908, he was helping Hortense and her sister Matilda McDuck run their brother&#x27;s empire as Scrooge&#x27;s chief accountant, mainly because Scrooge thought that as a possible heir, he would be motivated to work hard and stay honest. In 1920, he married Hortense and within the year became the father of twins: Donald and Della. The couple became parents when they already were more than 40 years old, according to Don Rosa.

Quackmore&#x27;s image is visible in several photographs in the &quot;DuckTales&quot; reboot premier, &quot;Woo-oo!&quot;, and is also mentioned by name in the episode by Webby Vanderquack.

===Hortense McDuck===

Hortense Duck (née McDuck; born 1876) is married to Quackmore Duck. She is also Donald&#x27;s mother, Humperdink and Elvira&#x27;s daughter-in-law, Daphne and Eider&#x27;s sister-in-law, and Huey, Dewey, and Louie&#x27;s maternal grandmother. She was born in Scotland and is the youngest sister of Scrooge McDuck.

===Daphne Duck===
Daphne Gander (née Duck) is Donald&#x27;s paternal aunt, Hortense&#x27;s sister-in-law, Huey, Dewey, and Louie&#x27;s maternal grand-aunt, and the mother of Gladstone Gander. In the story &quot;The Sign of The Triple Distelfink&quot; (1998), Don Rosa explains that Gladestone&#x27;s good luck was inherited from his mother, after a traveling worker painted a giant sign of the &quot;Triple Distelfink&quot; on her parents&#x27; stable on the day of her birth. The symbol was supposed to bring the baby luck, and it did: Daphne was always incredibly lucky. She worked in her parents&#x27; farm until at least 1902. Later, she stopped working and started living on the things she won in contests. She married Goostave Gander, and in 1920 became the mother of Gladstone Gander. Gladstone was born on her birthday and under the protection of the same symbol as his mother.

===Eider Duck===
Eider Duck is Donald&#x27;s paternal uncle, Hortense&#x27;s brother-in-law, and Huey, Dewey, and Louie&#x27;s maternal grand-uncle. He was first mentioned in August 1944 in the story &quot;The Fighting Falcon&quot; by Carl Barks. In this story, Donald receives a falcon called Farragut as a present by his Uncle Eider who does not live in Duckburg. Farragut arrives inside a big box brought to Donald&#x27;s house by an expressman. Barks never mentioned Eider again but Don Rosa decided to include him in his Duck Family Tree.

According to Rosa, Eider is the son of Humperdink and Elvira Duck and the father of Abner and Fethry Duck. As of 1902, he worked on his parents&#x27; farm. He later married Lulubelle Loon and became the father of at least two sons, Abner &quot;Whitewater&quot; Duck and Fethry Duck.

===Lulubelle Loon===
Lulubelle Duck (née Loon) is married to Eider Duck and the mother of Abner and Fethry Duck, according to Don Rosa&#x27;s version of the Duck family tree. She does not have any comic appearance so far, not even a cameo one.

===Sheriff Dan Duck===
Sheriff Dan Duck (aka Cousin Dan) is an old cousin of Donald who happens to be sheriff of a Western town called &quot;Bent Spur Gulch&quot;. Dan originally has thick, dark-grey eyebrows, a long, dark-grey mustache and long, dark-grey hair on the left and right sides of his head. He is generally shown holding a crutch. He appeared in two comic stories, &quot;Daredevil Deputy&quot; by Jack Bradbury, where he asks Donald to replace him while he recovers from &quot;a touch of rheumatism&quot;, and &quot;Trigger Gulch Gang&quot; by Tony Strobl, where he has only a brief appearance on the first page.

A remake of &quot;Daredevil Deputy&quot; was drawn by Chilean cartoonist Vicar for the Danish publisher Egmont. It&#x27;s called &quot;Sheriff for a Day&quot;, first published in 1978.

==Third generation==
===Donald Duck===

Donald Duck (born June 9, c. 1920) is the ill-tempered but good-hearted son of Quackmore and Hortense Duck, and the most well-known member of the family. He is the nephew of Scrooge McDuck, the older twin brother of Della Duck, and the uncle of her sons Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck. His girlfriend is Daisy Duck. He does not have any children of his own, but he is very close with his nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck. However, in the 1959 short &quot;How To Have An Accident At Work&quot;, he does in fact have a son (Donald Jr.) with Daisy. In some stories Donald is the triplet&#x27;s legal guardian, such as in the 1942 film &quot;The New Spirit&quot; in which Donald lists the boys as dependants on his income tax form.

===Della Duck===

Della Duck (called Dumbella in &quot;Donald&#x27;s Nephews&quot;; born June 9, c. 1920) is the mother of Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck, the younger twin sister of their uncle Donald Duck, and the niece of their grand-uncle Scrooge McDuck. She was first described as Donald Duck&#x27;s cousin, but was later referred to as Donald&#x27;s twin sister. She was first mentioned in a 1937 &quot;Donald Duck&quot; Sunday strip on October 17, 1937, in which she writes a letter explaining to Donald that she is sending her sons to stay with him.

Della made her first animated appearance in &quot;DuckTales&quot; (2017), with her sons discovering she was previously a companion of Scrooge and Donald&#x27;s in their adventures. Dewey and his brothers set out to investigate the cause of her disappearance along with Webby Vanderquack. In the Christmas episode, &quot;Last Christmas&quot;, it is revealed that as kids, Donald used to insult Della by calling her &quot;Dumbella&quot;, a reference to her name in &quot;Donald&#x27;s Nephews&quot;. She is voiced by Paget Brewster. Della Duck was married to ? Duck and had three triplet sons, Huey, Dewey, and Louie.

===Huey, Dewey, and Louie&#x27;s father===
The identity of Huey, Dewey, and Louie&#x27;s father is something of a mystery. The character does not appear in any stories, but he did partially appear in the 1993 Duck family tree drawn by Don Rosa. In this illustration, Rosa partially concealed the character&#x27;s face with a bird. While his first name was also hidden, his last name is revealed to be Duck. His face was fully shown in the unofficial Duck family tree by Mark Worden and first published in several fanzines, which labeled him &quot;? Duck&quot; and showed him with a flattop haircut and human-like ears.

In Huey, Dewey, and Louie&#x27;s first appearance in a 1937 &quot;Donald Duck&quot; Sunday strip, Della writes to Donald that the boys had placed a firecracker under their father&#x27;s chair as a prank and that their father had been sent to the hospital. This was the reason why the boys first showed up at Donald&#x27;s house. The father has not been mentioned again in the chronicles. In &quot;The Richest Duck in the World&quot;, when Scrooge mentions that the few family members he had had disappeared, the boys respond, &quot;We know how &quot;that&quot; feels!&quot;

===Fethry Duck===
Donald&#x27;s cousin Fethry Duck was created for the non-US market by Disney Studio Program employees Dick Kinney (writer) and Al Hubbard (artist) and was first featured in the story &quot;The Health Nut&quot;, published on August 2, 1964. Kinney and Hubbard created Fethry to be a beatnik member of the Duck family (the definition being &quot;a person who rejects or avoids conventional behavior&quot;). Fethry quickly adopts new hobbies and lifestyles and eagerly pursues the latest fads and trends, causing chaos for friends and family in the process. In his first story, Fethry is introduced as moving to Duckburg and having a prior acquaintance with Donald, who is already aware of Fethry&#x27;s obsessive tendency. Fethry wears a stocking cap, for reasons revealed in &quot;The Health Nut&quot;: he was convinced by a self-help book author that one&#x27;s head is healthier when it&#x27;s kept hot. Fethry&#x27;s trademark sweater, usually bearing a black stripe, is typically a different color depending on which country the story is published in.

Only three stories with Fethry initially appeared in the United States (&quot;Donald Duck&quot; #105–106 and &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; #304). Later, some of the Fethry Studio Program stories were reprinted in the &quot;Wonderful World of Disney&quot; giveaway magazine published in 1969–1970 for Gulf Oil. However, the character became popular in foreign markets. In Europe, Fethry has appeared in numerous Italian-produced comics. In Brazil, the character had his own comic book title during the 1980s, which lasted 56 issues. Hubbard and Kinney developed more than fifty comic stories with Fethry. The vast majority were published in English in Australia between 1964 and 1969, often in one-shot comics billed &quot;Donald and Fethry Duck&quot;—suggesting a comedic duo—or simply &quot;Fethry Duck&quot;.

Since Fethry was not created by Carl Barks and was never used in any of Barks&#x27; stories, popular American artist/writer Don Rosa does not consider Fethry part of the Duck family. However, due to editorial pressure from supervisor Byron Erickson at the helm of Egmont, Rosa reluctantly included him in his &quot;Duck Family Tree&quot;. According to this diagram, Fethry is the son of Eider Duck and Lulubelle Loon, the cousin of Donald Duck and the brother of Abner &quot;Whitewater&quot; Duck (from Barks&#x27; 1962 story, &quot;Log Jockey&quot;).

Fethry also works with Donald for Scrooge McDuck&#x27;s secret organization, originally called the P.I.A. (in Italian), as an assistant of the detective Umperio Bogarto (in 1996) and as Moby Duck&#x27;s First Mate (in the early 2000s). Donald has often teamed up with Fethry to work for Scrooge (usually with disastrous results), with Donald being the &quot;straight man&quot; and Fethry the &quot;funny man&quot;, although Donald&#x27;s reactions to Fethry and attempts to neutralize him are often as humorous as Fethry&#x27;s mishaps. In 1970s stories drawn by Tony Strobl, Fethry is the owner of a hyper-friendly dog named Poochie. Several Brazilian stories also featured Fethry&#x27;s pet.

Since the early 1970s, Fethry has occasionally donned superhero garb as the Red Bat () in Brazilian Disney comics. The Red Bat was created by artist Carlos Edgar Herrero and writer Ivan Saidenberg.

In 2018, Fethry made his first animated appearance in the &quot;DuckTales&quot; episode &quot;The Depths of Cousin Fethry!&quot;, voiced by Tom Kenny. He is depicted as the caretaker of one of Scrooge&#x27;s undersea research facilities that Huey and Dewey visit. While they are at first put off by his odd behavior, the two come to respect Fethry after he protects them from a sea monster. He later returns in &quot;Moonvasion&quot; to help protect the Earth from the invading Moonlanders and in &quot;The Last Adventure!&quot; to attend Webby Vanderquack&#x27;s birthday party.

===Whitewater Duck===
Whitewater Duck was created by Carl Barks and used by him only in the story &quot;Log Jockey&quot;, published in &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; #267 in December 1962. According to that story, he is a distant cousin of Donald and Huey, Dewey, and Louie, and works as a lumberjack in the woods.

Don Rosa&#x27;s Duck Family Tree states that Whitewater&#x27;s real name is Abner, and &quot;Whitewater&quot; is a nickname. He is also shown to be a son of Eider Duck and Lulubelle Loon and Fethry Duck&#x27;s brother, making him Donald&#x27;s first cousin.

===Dudly D. Duck===
Dudly D. Duck is a cousin of Donald who appears in the comic story &quot;Why All the Crabby Ducks?&quot; by Vic Lockman and Mike Arens. He is a flopped architect and inventor who was responsible for the construction of the &quot;Jog Tunnel&quot;, which annoys the citizens of Duckburg because it really has a jog in it, and for the bad planning of Duckburg&#x27;s streets. Therefore, Dudly became very unpopular and was forced to live isolated in a lonely street, including his name was forgotten until the day that Donald discovers who planned the &quot;Jog Tunnel&quot;, and then his girlfriend Daisy Duck reveals who is Dudly Duck through the newspaper where she works as reporter. A reporter rival of Daisy ends up discovering that Dudly is related to Donald, who in turn becomes unpopular too.

===Dimwitty Duck===
Dimwitty Duck (originally just called Dim-Witty) is a duck who was introduced in the comic story &quot;The Vanishing Banister&quot;, where he appears as an assistant of Donald Duck, who in turn appears working as a private detective. Daisy Duck has a brief appearance in the beginning of this one. But there are some old American stories with Dimwitty and Daisy where Donald does not appear. In the story &quot;On Disappearing Island&quot;, Dimwitty appeared for the first time as Moby&#x27;s ship hand and from then on he became the most common supporting character in Moby&#x27;s stories. Dimwitty is incredibly clumsy but he is loyal and subservient, and maybe that&#x27;s the reason why Moby keeps him as his ship hand. But a close kinship between them could also explain this fact. Dimwitty is taller than Donald and Moby. In some 1970s stories, Dimwitty was shown as a friend of Gus Goose.

There are some old stories where it&#x27;s revealed that Dimwitty&#x27;s surname is also &quot;Duck&quot;. The first one was &quot;The Fix-it-fiasco&quot;, which also features Daisy.

Just like Moby, Dimwitty had also a cameo appearance in the &quot;Darkwing Duck / Ducktales&quot; crossover called &quot;Dangerous Currency&quot; from 2011.

===Moby Duck===
Moby Duck, whose name is a spoof of the novel &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, was created by writer Vic Lockman and illustrator Tony Strobl in the comic-book story &quot;A Whale of an Adventure&quot; in &quot;Donald Duck&quot; #112 (March 1967). He made his only major animated appearance in the &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World of Color&quot; episode &quot;Pacifically Peeking&quot; (October 6, 1968), and had a cameo appearance in the episode &quot;House of Crime&quot; of the &quot;House of Mouse&quot; TV series. He first appeared in &quot;Donald Duck&quot; #112 where he is seen saving Donald from drowning at sea, after Donald was forced to accept Moby&#x27;s proposal to work as his helper, since Moby&#x27;s porpoise Porpy pretended to be a threatening shark. Later that year Moby got his own comic book title which ran 11 issues until 1970, and then from 1973 to 1978 (issues #12-30). Illustrators of American Moby Duck stories include Strobl, Kay Wright, and Pete Alvarado. Not seen in the US for two decades, he was used in a comic subseries produced in Italy during the 2000s. Moby had two cameo appearances in the 2010s: the first one was in an Italian story from 2010, and the second one was in the &quot;Darkwing Duck / Ducktales&quot; crossover called &quot;Dangerous Currency&quot; from 2011.

Moby is a relative of Donald Duck as seen in &quot;Sea Dog&#x27;s Holiday&quot; by Vic Lockman and Kay Wright. There are American old stories where Moby seems to be familiar to other members of Donald&#x27;s paternal family as well, like Grandma Duck and Gladstone Gander. In the comic story &quot;The Dread Sea Adventure&quot; by Lockman and Wright, Grandma exclaims when she sees Moby, &quot;Moby Duck, you salty old sea biscuit!&quot;, making it clear that she knows him very well.

==Fourth generation==
===Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck===

Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck (born c. 1940) are Donald&#x27;s three nephews, grand-nephews of his uncle Scrooge McDuck and identical triplet sons of Della Duck.

===Dugan Duck===
Dugan Duck is Fethry Duck&#x27;s nephew who is a little bit younger than Huey, Dewey, and Louie. According to the Brazilian comic story &quot;O Nascimento Do Biquinho&quot;, he is the son of Fethry&#x27;s sister, who lives in the periphery of Duckburg.

==Coot kin==
The Coot family, typically called the Coot kin in stories, are the relatives of Grandma Duck and, along with the Clan McDuck, constitute the third major branch of Donald&#x27;s family tree. The name &quot;Coot&quot; was used by several comic authors including Carl Barks, but Don Rosa was the first to show their relationship to Donald. The members of the family are depicted as white Pekin ducks like Donald, although real-life coots are typically black.

===Cornelius Coot===
Cornelius Coot (1790–1880) founded Duckburg (and the real-world, but since closed Mickey&#x27;s Toontown Fair at the Magic Kingdom). He first appeared as a statue in &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; #138 in the 1952 story &quot;Statuesque Spendthrifts&quot; by Carl Barks. His statue and legacy has later appeared in many other stories. Although Cornelius was a well-known figure to readers of Disney comics, his character history was not told until Don Rosa began using the character in the late 1980s. The following history is mainly based on Rosa&#x27;s stories, especially &quot;His Majesty, McDuck&quot;, first published in &quot;Uncle Scrooge Adventures&quot; #14.

A statue of Cornelius holding an ear of corn is present in Mickey&#x27;s Toontown Fair in Walt Disney World&#x27;s Magic Kingdom. Before 1996, the land was known as Mickey&#x27;s Birthdayland/Starland, and was set in the city of Duckburg.

Cornelius Coot made his first television appearance in the &quot;DuckTales&quot; episode, &quot;The Golden Armory of Cornelius Coot&quot;. The episode retells the story of Coot&#x27;s founding of Duckburg, though the Spanish are replaced by Beagles in the story. Huey, Dewey, Louie, and Webby explore the catacombs under Fort Duckburg in search of his treasure, discovering a series of giant popcorn makers that Coot used to imitate the sound of gunfire and scare the Beagles into retreating.

===Clinton Coot===
Clinton Coot (1830-1910) was first mentioned in &quot;Uncle Scrooge Adventures&quot; #27 in the story &quot;Guardians of the Lost Library&quot;, first published in July, 1994. There he was introduced as the son of Cornelius Coot and the founder of The Junior Woodchucks, inspired by the book given to him by his father.

In &quot;The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck&quot; it is revealed that he is the father of Grandma Duck. In Don Rosa&#x27;s Duck Family Tree, Clinton is married to Gertrude Gadwall and their two children are Grandma Duck (Elvira Coot) and Casey Coot.

He is named after Bill Clinton, who was running for President of the United States when Don Rosa created the character.

Clinton makes his animated debut in the 2018 TV show &quot;Legend of the Three Caballeros&quot;, voiced by Thomas Lennon. In the series, Clinton was an archaeologist obsessed with his ancestor Don Dugo and his adventuring companions, who were the original Three Caballeros. He founded the New Quackmore Institute near the site of one of their headquarters, building a cabana over the base itself, but his business partner Baroness Von Sheldgoose would seize control over the rest of the land the campus sat on. After his death, he arranged for the cabana to be left to his great-grandson Donald and the descendants of the other two Caballeros, Panchito Pistoles and José Carioca.

===Gertrude Gadwall===
Gertrude Coot (née Gadwall) is married to Clinton Coot and the mother of Casey and Elvira Coot (&quot;Grandma Duck&quot;). Like Lulubelle Loon, Gertrude has appeared only in Don Rosa&#x27;s version of the Duck family tree.

===Casey Coot===
Casey Coot (born 1860) first appeared in &quot;Last Sled to Dawson&quot;, first published in June, 1988. He is introduced as an unsuccessful gold prospector and friend of Scrooge McDuck during his years in Klondike. In need of money he sold to the significantly more successful Scrooge McDuck his share in Duckburg, Calisota, USA. His share included &quot;Killmule Hill&quot; which, renamed to &quot;Killmotor Hill&quot;, comprises the land where Scrooge&#x27;s money bin stands. He later appeared in &quot;The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck Part 8&quot; and &quot;Hearts of the Yukon&quot;. In &quot;The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck Part 10&quot; it is revealed that he and Grandma Duck are brother and sister.

In Don Rosa&#x27;s Duck Family Tree he is featured as a grandson of Cornelius Coot, a son of Clinton Coot and Gertrude Gadwall. He married Gretchen Grebe and they had at least two kids named Fanny and Cuthbert Coot, being the maternal grandfather of Fanny&#x27;s son Gus Goose.

===Gretchen Grebe===
Gretchen Coot (née Grebe) is married to Casey Coot, the mother of Cuthbert and Fanny Coot, and the maternal grandmother of Gus Goose.

===Fanny Coot===
Fanny Coot is the mother of Donald&#x27;s cousin Gus Goose; she was first mentioned in the Donald Duck comic strip of May 9, 1938 by Bob Karp &amp; Al Taliaferro where Gus first appeared. Gus&#x27;s mother&#x27;s surname was not revealed in this comic strip, where she identifies herself in a letter to Donald as &quot;Aunt Fanny&quot;. In Don Rosa&#x27;s Duck Family Tree she is featured as a daughter of Casey Coot and his wife Gretchen Grebe, and so a niece of Elvira Coot, Donald&#x27;s paternal grandmother, and first cousin of Donald&#x27;s father, Quackmore Duck. Fanny also had a brother named Cuthbert Coot and she married Luke Goose, and then became the mother of Gus Goose.

===Cuthbert Coot===
Cuthbert Coot was introduced in the story &quot;Webfooted Wrangler,&quot; first published in April 1945, as a distant cousin of Donald Duck and a rancher. In Don Rosa&#x27;s Duck family tree he is included as a member of the Coot Kin as son of Casey Coot and Gretchen Grebe.

===Kildare Coot===
Kildare Coot was introduced by Italian artist Romano Scarpa as a highly eccentric fourth cousin of Donald Duck in the story &quot;Sgrizzo, il papero più balzano del mondo&quot; (roughly translated as &quot;Kildare Coot, the weirdest duck in the world&quot;), first published on October 25, 1964. Though his exact relationship to Donald remains uncertain his last name suggests he belongs to the Coot Kin and that he is related to Donald through Elvira Coot, Donald&#x27;s paternal grandmother. Curiously, Kildare usually treats Gideon McDuck, Scrooge&#x27;s half-brother, as his uncle. He calls Gideon &#x27;Zio&#x27;, which means uncle in Italian. Kildare and his fellow Andy Ascott (original Italian name) appear as reporters of Gideon&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Cricket&quot;, in some Italian stories.

==Goose family==
===Luke Goose===
Luke Goose (sometimes called Luke the Goose) is the father of Donald&#x27;s cousin Gus Goose. He was originally supposed to be Gladstone Gander&#x27;s father, Daphne Duck&#x27;s husband and Gus&#x27;s uncle, but Carl Barks later changed his mind, making Goostave Gander (who was originally Gladstone&#x27;s adoptive father after Luke and Daphne &quot;overate at a free-lunch picnic&quot;) Gladstone&#x27;s biological father and Daphne&#x27;s husband. Luke the Goose disappeared from the tree.

When Don Rosa created his Duck Family Tree, he used Luke Goose (removing &quot;the&quot; from his name) and made him the husband of Fanny Coot and Gus Goose&#x27;s father.

===Gus Goose===
Gus Goose is Donald Duck&#x27;s second cousin, and the great-nephew of Grandma Duck. He debuted on May 9, 1938, in Al Taliaferro and Bob Karp&#x27;s &quot;Donald Duck&quot; comic strip, before making an animated appearance in the 1939 short &quot;Donald&#x27;s Cousin Gus&quot;. Because the animation studio took much longer to produce a film and worked with a schedule much farther ahead than the comic strip, Gus, like Donald&#x27;s nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie &quot;first saw the light of day&quot; in the animation department, with the comic strip being based on the film that was in-the-works. Gus&#x27;s main personality traits are laziness and gluttony.

Within Disney comics, Gus is usually shown living as a farmhand on Grandma Duck&#x27;s farm outside of Duckburg. Along with his gluttony, Gus is quite lazy, often doing little if any work on Grandma&#x27;s farm. He also has a tendency of falling asleep at random occasions, sometimes even standing up. On occasion Gus has even shown signs of ingenuity as to finding methods or solutions to make his chores much easier for him and at times even automating them so he does not have to work at all.

Gus made no appearances in &quot;DuckTales&quot;, but there is a background character in the series, Vacation Van Honk, who looks similar to him.

Gus appeared in the 2000s animated series &quot;Disney&#x27;s House of Mouse&quot;, as the club&#x27;s gluttonous chef, speaking only in honks rather than words. He also made non-speaking cameo appearances in both &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; and &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;.

The friend and neighbor Gustav Goose from &quot;Quack Pack&quot; is probably not the same as Cousin Gus since there are very few similarities (aside from the name and general size of the character). Some confusion is also caused by the German comicbook version of Gladstone Gander being referred to as &quot;Gustav Gans&quot; (&quot;Gustav Goose&quot;).

In Danish comic book stories, Gus Goose has appeared as the boyfriend of a classy and rich anthropomorphic swan named Cissy Swann. In Italy, a nephew of him named Pepper appeared in two stories.

==Gander family==
===Goostave Gander===
Goostave Gander is Gladstone Gander&#x27;s father. In some early stories he is married to Matilda McDuck, Scrooge&#x27;s sister and adopted Gladstone, but Carl Barks later had him married to Daphne Duck instead. They are considered the parents of Gladstone Gander; although his wife and son&#x27;s luck does not include him. &quot;Us &quot;Ganders&quot; have never sunk low enough to associate with you &quot;Ducks&quot;!&quot;, exclaimed Gladstone to Donald in &quot;Race to the South Seas&quot; by Carl Barks, suggesting that there is a mutual antipathy between his father&#x27;s family and his mother&#x27;s. In this same story, Gladstone exclaims, &quot;Us &quot;Ganders&quot; have never worked!&quot;, what suggests that originally Gladstone&#x27;s luck came from his father&#x27;s side.

===Gladstone Gander===

Gladstone Gander is a Walt Disney fictional character created in 1948 by comic artist and writer Carl Barks. He is an anthropomorphic male goose (or gander) who possess exceptional good luck that grants him anything he desires as well as protecting from any harm. This is in contrast to his cousin Donald Duck who is often characterized for having bad luck. Gladstone is also a rival of Donald for the affection of Daisy Duck.

===Shamrock Gander===
Shamrock Gander is Gladstone&#x27;s nephew. Shamrock first appeared in a story printed in &quot;Duck Album Four Color&quot; #649 where he was shown to be as lucky as his uncle Gladstone. He has only been used a few times since; one example is a Brazilian comic story where he competes with Huey, Dewey, and Louie.

<text>Delta Air Lines, Inc. is a major airline in the United States headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. It is the United States&#x27;s oldest operating airline and the seventh-oldest operating worldwide. Delta, along with its regional subsidiaries and contractors operating under the brand name Delta Connection, operate over 5,400 flights daily and serve 325 destinations in 52 countries on six continents. Delta is a founding member of the SkyTeam airline alliance. As of the end of 2023, it had 100,000 employees.

Delta has nine hubs, with Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport being its largest in terms of total passengers and number of departures. It is ranked second among the world&#x27;s largest airlines by number of passengers carried, passenger miles flown, and fleet size. It is ranked first by revenue for commercially owned airline companies as well as in brand value, and 70th on the &quot;Fortune&quot; 500. Delta was ranked first in the annual rankings of top airlines by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in 2022, 2023, and 2024 and ranked first in the 2024 Readers’ Choice Awards of Best Airlines in the U.S. by &quot;Condé Nast Traveler&quot;.

==History==
===Early history===
The history of Delta Air Lines began with the world&#x27;s first aerial crop dusting operation called Huff Daland Dusters, Inc. The company was founded on March 2, 1925, in Macon, Georgia, before moving to Monroe, Louisiana, in the summer of 1925. It flew a Huff-Daland Duster, the first true crop duster, designed to combat the boll weevil infestation of cotton crops. C.E. Woolman, general manager and later Delta&#x27;s first CEO, led a group of local investors to acquire the company&#x27;s assets. Delta Air Service was incorporated on December 3, 1928, and was named after the Mississippi Delta region.

Passenger operations began on June 17, 1929, from Dallas, Texas, to Jackson, Mississippi, with stops at Shreveport and Monroe, Louisiana. By June 1930, service had extended east to Atlanta and west to Fort Worth, Texas. Passenger service ceased in October 1930 when the airmail contract for the route Delta had pioneered was awarded to another airline, which purchased the assets of Delta Air Service. Local banker Travis Oliver, acting as a trustee, C.E. Woolman, and other local investors purchased back the crop-dusting assets of Delta Air Service and incorporated as Delta Air Corporation on December 31, 1930.

Delta Air Corporation secured an airmail contract in 1934, and began doing business as Delta Air Lines over Mail Route 24, stretching from Fort Worth, Texas, to Charleston, South Carolina. Delta moved its headquarters from Monroe, Louisiana, to its current location in Atlanta in 1941. The company name officially became Delta Air Lines in 1945. In 1946, the company commenced regularly scheduled freight transport. In 1949, the company launched the first discounted fares between Chicago and Miami. In 1953, the company launched its first international routes after the acquisition of Chicago and Southern Air Lines. In 1959, it was the first airline to fly the Douglas DC-8. In 1960, it was the first airline to fly Convair 880 jets. In 1964, it launched the Deltamatic reservation systems using computers in the IBM 7070 series. In 1965, Delta was the first airline to fly the McDonnell Douglas DC-9.

===Growth and acquisitions===
By 1970, Delta had an all-jet fleet, and in 1972 it acquired Northeast Airlines. Trans-Atlantic service began in 1978 with the first nonstop flights from Atlanta to London. In 1981, Delta launched a frequent-flyer program. In 1987, it acquired Western Airlines, and that same year Delta began trans-Pacific service (Atlanta to Portland, Oregon, to Tokyo). In 1990, Delta was the first airline in the United States to fly McDonnell Douglas MD-11 jets. In 1991, it acquired substantially all of Pan Am&#x27;s trans-Atlantic routes and the Pan Am Shuttle, rebranded as the Delta Shuttle. Delta was now the leading airline across the Atlantic.

In 1997, Delta was the first airline to board more than 100 million passengers in a calendar year. Also that year, Delta began an expansion of its international routes into Latin America. In 2003, the company launched Song, a low-cost carrier.

===Bankruptcy and restructuring (2005–2007)===
On September 14, 2005, the company filed for bankruptcy, citing rising fuel costs. It emerged from bankruptcy in April 2007 after fending off a hostile takeover from US Airways and its shares were re-listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

===Acquisition of Northwest Airlines (2008–2010)===
The acquisition of Northwest Airlines was announced on April 14, 2008. It was approved and consummated on October 29, 2008. Northwest continued to operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Delta until December 31, 2009, when the Northwest Airlines operating certificate was merged into that of Delta. Delta completed integration with Northwest on January 31, 2010, when their computer reservations system and websites were combined, and the Northwest Airlines brand was officially retired.

=== Department of Transportation investigation ===
In July 2024, The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) opened an investigation into Delta Air Lines, after receiving hundreds of complaints over cancelled and delayed flights that started after the CrowdStrike outage caused technological chaos worldwide.

;Delta One

Delta One is the airline&#x27;s premier business class product, available on long-haul international flights, as well as transcontinental service from New York–Kennedy to Los Angeles and San Francisco.

Delta One features lie-flat seating on all aircraft types and direct aisle access from every seat on all types except the Boeing 757-200 (in which only a special sub-fleet of approximately 20 aircraft feature lie-flats) and in their &#x27;type 35L&#x27; ex-LATAM A350s (which use a 2-2-2 layout). The Boeing 767-300ER seats, designed by James Thompson, feature a space-saving design whereby the seats are staggered such that when in the fully flat position, the foot of each bed extends under the armrests of the seat in front of it. On the Airbus A330 cabins, Delta One features the &quot;Cirrus&quot; flat-bed sleeper suite by Zodiac Seats U.S., configured in a reverse herringbone pattern.

All seats are also equipped with a personal, on-demand in-flight-entertainment (IFE) system, universal power-ports, a movable reading light, and a folding work table. Passengers also receive meals, alcoholic beverages, an amenity kit, bedding, and pre-flight Delta Sky Club access.

In August 2016, Delta announced the introduction of Delta One Suites on select widebody fleets. The suites will feature a door to the aisle for enhanced privacy, as well as improved storage space, a larger IFE screen, and an updated design. The suites rolled out on the Airbus A350 fleet, first delivered in July 2017, followed by installation within the Boeing 777 fleet. Delta&#x27;s Airbus A330-900, which began revenue service for the airline in July 2019, also features Delta One Suites. Also in July 2019, Delta began retrofitting a new seat on the 767-400ER, which featured increased privacy and design similar to Delta One Suites, though without a privacy door. These seats lack a door due to the 767&#x27;s smaller cabin width.

;First Class

First Class is offered on mainline domestic flights (except those featuring Delta One service), select short- and medium-haul international flights, and Delta Connection aircraft. Seats range from wide and have between of pitch. Passengers in this class receive a wider variety of free snacks compared to Main Cabin, as well as free drinks and alcohol, and full meal service on flights and longer. Certain aircraft also feature power ports at each seat and free entertainment products from Delta Studio. First Class passengers are also eligible for priority boarding.

;Premium Select

In April 2016, Delta CEO Ed Bastian announced that a new Premium Economy cabin would be added. Since renamed to Premium Select, this cabin will feature extra legroom; adjustable leg rests; extra seat pitch, width, and recline; and a new premium service. Delta introduced it on its new Airbus A350, first delivered in fall 2017, to be followed by the now-retired Boeing 777. In October 2018, Delta announced that it would be selling first class seats on domestically configured Boeing 757 aircraft flying transatlantic routes as Premium Select. Delta&#x27;s A330-900, delivered in 2019, also offers Premium Select. In 2021, Delta began retrofitting many of its 767-300ER and older A330 aircraft with Premium Select.

Delta Comfort+ seats are installed on all aircraft and feature of pitch; on all Delta One configured aircraft, of pitch and 50 percent more recline over standard Main Cabin seats. Additional amenities include: priority boarding, dedicated overhead space, complimentary beer, wine, and spirits on flights or more, and complimentary premium snacks on flights or more. Complimentary premium entertainment is available via Delta Studio, with free headsets available on most flights. On transcontinental flights between JFK-LAX/SFO, Delta Comfort+ passengers also get Luvo snack wraps. Certain Medallion members can upgrade from Main Cabin to Comfort+ for free right after booking, while other customers can upgrade for a fee or with SkyMiles.

;Main Cabin

Main Cabin (Economy Class) is available on all aircraft with seats ranging from wide and of pitch. The main cabin on some aircraft has an articulating seat bottom where the seat bottom moves forward in addition to the seat back tilting backwards when reclining.

Main Cabin passengers receive complimentary snacks and non-alcoholic drinks on all flights or longer. Alcoholic beverages are also available for purchase. Complimentary meals and alcoholic drinks are provided on long-haul international flights as well as selected transcontinental domestic flights, such as between New York–JFK and Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego. As part of Delta&#x27;s Flight Fuel buy on board program, meals are available for purchase on other North American flights or longer.

Delta operated a different buy-on-board program between 2003 and 2005. The previous program had items from differing providers, depending on the origin and destination of the flight. Prices ranged up to $10 ($ when adjusted for inflation). The airline started the service on a few selected flights in July 2003, and the meal service was initially offered on 400 flights. Delta ended this buy-on-board program in 2005; instead, Delta began offering snacks at no extra charge on flights over 90 minutes to most U.S. domestic flights and some flights to the Caribbean and Latin America. Beginning in mid-March 2005 the airline planned to stop providing pillows on flights within the 48 contiguous U.S. states, Bermuda, Canada, the Caribbean, and Central America. In addition, the airline increased the price of alcoholic beverages on Delta mainline flights from $4 ($ when adjusted for inflation) to $5 ($ when adjusted for inflation); the increase in alcohol prices did not occur on Song flights.

;Basic Economy
Basic Economy is a basic version of Main Cabin, offering the same services with fewer flexibility options for a lower price. Examples of fewer flexibility options include no ticket changes, no paid or complimentary upgrades regardless of frequent-flier status, and only having a seat assigned at check-in. As of December 2021, Basic Economy travelers no longer earn award miles (used for redeeming free travel, for example) or medallion qualifying miles (which count towards elite status).

==Reward programs==
===SkyMiles===

SkyMiles is the frequent flyer program for Delta Air Lines. Miles do not expire but accounts may be deactivated by Delta in certain cases, such as the death of a program member or fraudulent activity.

===Delta Sky Club===
Delta Sky Club is the branding name of Delta&#x27;s airport lounges. Membership is available through an annual membership that can be purchased with either money or miles. International passengers travelling in Delta One class get free access. Membership can also be granted through top-level Delta status or by being an American Express cardholder with certain exceptions. As of January 2019, Delta no longer offered single-day passes.

Originally, Delta&#x27;s membership-based airport clubs were called Crown Room lounges, with Northwest&#x27;s called WorldClubs.

Exclusive Delta One Clubs for customers travelling in business class are slated to open at New York–Kennedy, Los Angeles, and Boston in 2024.

In February 2024, Delta announced a new, more exclusive or premium level of Sky Club lounge aimed at high-spending travellers. The first would be at New York&#x27;s John F. Kennedy International Airport, followed by those in Boston&#x27;s Logan International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport later in the year. In addition to wellness areas, the lounge would offer a full-service brasserie and a marketplace influenced or assisted by a chef that would feature an open kitchen. The move represented a shift away from a standard offering to something closer to a unique experience for each airport and the city in which the lounge was located.

===SkyBonus===
On November 27, 2001, Delta Air Lines launched SkyBonus, a program aimed toward small-to-medium businesses spending between $5,000 and $500,000 annually on air travel. Businesses can earn points toward free travel and upgrades, as well as Sky Club memberships and SkyMiles Silver Medallion status. Points are earned on paid travel based on various fare amounts paid, booking codes, and place origin or destination. While enrolled businesses are able to earn points toward free travel, the travelling passenger is still eligible to earn SkyMiles during his or her travel.

In early 2010, Delta Air Lines merged its SkyBonus program with Northwest&#x27;s similar Biz Perks program.

==Corporate affairs==

=== Business trends ===
The key trends for Delta Air Lines are (as of the financial year ending December 31):
===Personnel===
Between its mainline operation and subsidiaries, and as of March 2015, Delta employs nearly 80,000 people. Ed Bastian is the current chief executive officer and has served in this position since May 2, 2016. Joanne Smith is Executive Vice President and Chief People Officer responsible for the oversight and support of personnel needs at Delta. She was appointed on October 1, 2014, replacing Mike Campbell.

Delta&#x27;s 14,500 mainline pilots are represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, International and are the union&#x27;s largest pilot group. The company&#x27;s approximately 180 flight dispatchers are represented by the Professional Airline Flight Control Association (PAFCA). Not counting the pilots and flight dispatchers, Delta is the only one of the five largest airlines in the United States, and one of only two in the top 9 (the other being JetBlue), whose non-pilot USA domestic staff is entirely non-union. In August 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Delta Air Lines announced that it would be cutting 1,941 pilot job positions if it could not conclude a cost reduction deal with its union. In January 2021, Delta said that, thanks to the federal support, it will be able to bring back 400 pilots in full time.

=== Delta Global Staffing ===
Delta Global Staffing (DGS) was a temporary employment firm located in Atlanta, Georgia. Delta Global Staffing was a wholly owned subsidiary of Delta Air Lines, Inc., and a division of the internal company DAL Global Services.

Delta Air Lines sold majority ownership of DAL Global Services to Argenbright Holdings on December 21, 2018. As part of the sale, Delta dissolved the staffing division of DGS.

It was founded in 1995 as a provider of temporary staffing for Delta primarily in Atlanta. DGS has since expanded to include customers and businesses outside the airline and aviation industries. DGS now supports customers in major US metropolitan areas.

Delta Global Staffing provided contract workers for short and long term assignments, VMS partnering, VOP on-site management, temp-to-hire, direct placements, and payroll services. DGS services markets such as call centers, customer services and administrative placements, IT &amp; professional recruiting, logistics, finance &amp; accounting, hospitality, and aviation/airline industry.

===Headquarters and offices===
Delta&#x27;s corporate headquarters is located on a corporate campus on the northern boundary of Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport, within the city limits of Atlanta. This location has served as Delta&#x27;s headquarters since 1941, when the company relocated its corporate offices from Monroe, Louisiana, to Greater Atlanta. The crop dusting division of Delta remained headquartered in Monroe until Delta ceased crop dusting in 1966. Before 1981, the Delta corporate campus, an plot of land in proximity to the old Hartsfield Airport terminal, was outside the City of Atlanta limits in unincorporated Fulton County. On August 3, 1981, the Atlanta City Council approved the annexation of of land, an area containing the Delta headquarters. As of 1981 Delta would have had to begin paying $200,000 annually to the City of Atlanta in taxes. In September 1981, the airline sued the city, challenging the annexation on the basis of the constitutionality of the 1960 City of Atlanta annexation of the Hartsfield old terminal. The City of Atlanta was only permitted to annex areas that are adjacent to areas already in the Atlanta city limits.

In addition to hosting Delta&#x27;s corporate headquarters, Hartsfield–Jackson is also the home of Delta TechOps, the airline&#x27;s primary maintenance, repair, and overhaul arm and the largest full-service airline MRO in North America, specializing in engines, components, airframe, and line maintenance.

Delta maintains a large presence in the Twin Cities, with over 12,000 employees in the region as well as significant corporate support functions housed in the Minneapolis area, including the company&#x27;s information technology divisional offices.

===Corporate identity===
Delta&#x27;s logo, often called the &quot;widget&quot;, was originally unveiled in 1959. Its triangle shape is taken from the Greek letter delta, and recalls the airline&#x27;s early history operating in the Mississippi Delta. It is also said to be reminiscent of the swept-wing design of the DC-8, Delta&#x27;s first jet aircraft.

Delta&#x27;s current livery is called &quot;Upward &amp; Onward&quot;. It features a white fuselage with the company&#x27;s name in blue lettering and a widget on the vertical stabilizer. Delta introduced its current livery in 2007 as part of a re-branding after it emerged from bankruptcy. The new livery consists of four colors, while the old one (called &quot;colors in motion&quot;) uses eight. This meant the switch saved the airline money by removing one day from each aircraft&#x27;s painting cycle. The airline took four years to repaint all of its aircraft into the current scheme, including aircraft inherited from Northwest Airlines.

===Environmental initiatives===
In 2008, Delta Air Lines was given an award from the United States Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s Design for the Environment (DfE) program for its use of PreKote, a more environmentally friendly, non-hexavalent chromium surface pretreatment on its aircraft, replacing hazardous chemicals formerly used to improve paint adhesion and prevent corrosion. In addition, PreKote reduces water usage by two-thirds and reduces wastewater treatment.

PreKote is also saving money by reducing the time needed to paint each airplane. With time savings of eight to ten percent, it will save an estimated more than $1 million annually.

Despite having purchased 9.7 million metric tonnes of carbon offsets in 2022, Delta was in the process of moving away from such investments to reduce the company&#x27;s carbon footprint by the end of March of that year and was instead focusing on reducing emissions from company operations. In May 2023, Delta Air Lines received a consumer class action lawsuit filed in Central California U.S. District Court over marketing claims that the company is the world&#x27;s first carbon neutral airline.

==In popular culture==

=== Deltalina ===

As part of the re-branding project, a safety video featuring a flight attendant was posted on YouTube in early 2008, getting over 1 million views and the attention of news outlets, specifically for the video&#x27;s tone mixed with the serious safety message. The flight attendant, Katherine Lee, was dubbed &quot;Deltalina&quot; by a member of FlyerTalk for her resemblance to Angelina Jolie. Delta had considered several styles for its current safety video, including animation, before opting for a video presenting a flight attendant speaking to the audience. The video was filmed on a former Song Airlines Boeing 757-200.

==On-time performance==
In 2023, Delta flights arrived at their destination on time 84.72% of the time, compared to the North American industry average of 74.45% per Cirium. Delta completed 98.82% of its scheduled flights.

== Award and recognition ==
On June 24, 2024, Delta Air Lines was voted &quot;2024&quot; &quot;Best Airline in North America&quot; and &quot;Best Airline Staff Service in North America&quot; by Skytrax.

== Accidents and incidents ==

The following are major accidents and incidents that occurred on Delta mainline aircraft. For Northwest Airlines incidents, see Northwest Airlines accidents and incidents. For Delta Connection incidents, see Delta Connection incidents and accidents.

All told, in 14 fatal accidents involving at least one death, 299 passengers and crew died, 11 on two other aircraft died (in two collision accidents), and 16 persons on the ground died (in four accidents).
















== Controversies and passenger incidents ==
In July 2024, Delta canceled over 7,000 flights during a disruption following the 2024 CrowdStrike incident. The incident closely resembled the 2022 Southwest Airlines scheduling crisis, when a factor outside of the airline&#x27;s control triggered a resulting mass cancellation event. On Tuesday July 23, 2024, United States Secretary of Transportation, Pete Buttigieg, announced the Department of Transportation would be launching an investigation into the events that prevented Delta Air Lines from swiftly recovering, as other airlines had. Over the course of the event over 500,000 passengers were inconvenienced, according to Delta CEO Ed Bastian, and over 3,000 complaints had been lodged with the government according to the Department of Transportation.

Delta has claimed to have lost $500 million due to the outages and associated costs. The airline has hired David Boies in preparation for litigation against Microsoft and CrowdStrike.

On November 26, 2024, a passenger without a boarding pass bypassed all security protocols and managed to stow aboard a flight from New York JFK airport to Paris.

<doc id="77553" wikidata="Q3260246" url="?curid=77553" title="Mickey Mouse universe">
<text>The Mickey Mouse universe is a fictional shared universe which is the setting for stories involving Disney cartoon characters, including Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Donald and Daisy Duck, Pluto and Goofy as the primary members (colloquially known as the &quot;Sensational Six&quot;), and many other characters related to them, most of them being anthropomorphic animals. The universe originated from the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; animated short films produced by Disney starting in 1928, although its first consistent version was created by Floyd Gottfredson in the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; newspaper comic strip. Real-world versions also exist in Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland, called Mickey&#x27;s Toontown.

Since 1990, the city in which Mickey lives is typically called Mouseton in American comics. In modern continuity, Mouseton is often depicted as being located in the fictional U.S. state of Calisota, analogous to Northern California. This fictional state was invented by comics writer Carl Barks in 1952 as the location for Donald Duck&#x27;s home city, Duckburg.

The most consistent aspect of the Mickey Mouse universe is the characters. The most well-known include Mickey&#x27;s girlfriend Minnie, pet dog Pluto, friends Goofy, Horace Horsecollar, Clarabelle Cow, and nemesis Pete. Some Disney productions incorporate characters from Disney&#x27;s animated feature films, such as &quot;Bath Day&quot; (1946), in which Figaro from &quot;Pinocchio&quot; appears as Minnie&#x27;s cat (becoming her recurring pet in several productions), &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; (1983), and – most extensively – &quot;House of Mouse&quot; (2001–2003).

Although crossovers between the Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck universes have been infrequent, the two universes overlap. Characters from the Donald Duck universe make occasional appearances in the Mickey Mouse universe and vice versa.

The term &quot;Mickey Mouse universe&quot; is not officially used by The Walt Disney Company, but it has been used by Disney comics author and animation historian David Gerstein. The Walt Disney Company typically uses terms such as Mickey &amp; Friends or Mickey &amp; the Gang to refer to the character franchise.

== Continuity development ==
The Mickey Mouse universe essentially originated with the debut of Mickey himself in &quot;Plane Crazy&quot; (1928). Although Mickey&#x27;s stories included the character Pete, who was created in 1925, the world in which Mickey lives holds a continuity largely independent from earlier films. An exception to this was the reintroduction of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit in 2010 with the release of &quot;Epic Mickey&quot;.

In 1930, Disney began a &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; comic strip which greatly expanded Mickey&#x27;s world. The stories then became a work of collaborative fiction with writers working in different mediums and different countries. This sometimes caused continuity discrepancies. For example, while Mickey and his friends largely live in the same contemporary setting, they sometimes appear in exotic settings, including period pieces (&quot;Brave Little Tailor&quot;, &quot;The Nifty Nineties&quot;) and fantasy films (&quot;Fantasia&quot;, &quot;Fun and Fancy Free&quot;).

The comics writers explained this discrepancy was to present the characters as &quot;real&quot; cartoon characters who are employed by Disney as actors. Walter J. Ong in his cultural research of Mickey Mouse and Americanism also agreed with this opinion. In short, characters are more human-like, featuring fewer animal features in their characteristics. This understanding of the characters leading separate lives was welcomed by Walt Disney. When asked whether or not Mickey and Minnie were married, Disney replied that the mice were indeed married in their &quot;private lives&quot;, but that they sometimes appear as boyfriend and girlfriend for &quot;screen purposes.&quot; Also, in the World War II propaganda film &quot;The New Spirit&quot; (1942), Donald Duck fills out his income tax and lists his occupation as &quot;actor&quot;, and the film &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (2004) includes a DVD bonus feature of the characters reminiscing on their experience filming the feature film.

Animation historian David Gerstein has noted that although the characters will appear in different settings and sometimes even change their names (&quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;), the characters are still themselves and behave in a way consistent with their natures.

Initially, Disney comics were produced in the United States. Over the years, demand for these comics eventually became so intense that stories were created in the United States exclusively for foreign consumption. Disney licensed its characters to foreign publishers. As a result, many Disney comics stories have been created by European or Latin American authors, resulting in more continuity discrepancies and local variations of the Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck universes. Some characters have become more popular abroad than in the United States, while some appeared and were used solely in foreign stories.

Generally, Mickey Mouse series films are for entertainment purposes. Unlike traditional stories like Aesop&#x27;s Fables, Disney animation generally does not avoid adult or mature scenes. In &quot;Hawaiian Holiday&quot; (1937), Goofy was in a scene of being in a grave. Disney arranged a laugh scene after that. Its choice of scene creation can be seen as a signature of the attention to entertainment effort.

== Places ==
=== Mickey&#x27;s farm ===
In &quot;Plane Crazy&quot; (1928), the first produced Mickey Mouse story, Mickey is seen at a farm. In his early films, Mickey is in a rural setting, but most commonly at a farm. This setting was succinctly presented in the first sentences of one of Mickey&#x27;s first storybooks:

In the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; newspaper strip, Mickey&#x27;s farm was most likely located in the midwestern United States, as indicated by characters&#x27; comments to have arrived &quot;out west&quot; to Death Valley and to go &quot;back east&quot; to conduct business, etc. This rural setting reflected Walt Disney&#x27;s own childhood in Missouri and like Disney, Mickey eventually moved to the city, although he never forgets his roots. Mickey sometimes makes references to his life &quot;back on the farm.&quot;

=== Mouseton ===
Mickey appeared in an urban setting as early as 1931 in the short film &quot;Traffic Troubles&quot; where he works as a taxi driver. Mickey&#x27;s city was unnamed until 1932, when the comic story &quot;The Great Orphanage Robbery&quot; identified it as Silo Center. Some Floyd Gottfredson stories simply called the city Hometown while other Gottfredson stories used the name Mouseville. But the first consistent name for Mickey&#x27;s city came in 1950s Italy, where it was called Topolinia (from &quot;Topolino&quot; or &#x27;little mouse,&#x27; Mickey&#x27;s Italian name).

In 1990, Disney Comics launched the new American comic &quot;Mickey Mouse Adventures&quot; and initially planned to use the name Mouseville there. But due to then-current Mighty Mouse cartoons&#x27; use of a city called Mouseville, the new name Mouseton was created for Mickey&#x27;s town instead; both in &quot;Mickey Mouse Adventures&quot; and in Disney&#x27;s contemporary reprints of vintage stories in &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; (1991–93). Later publisher Gemstone and the present Boom Studios have continued the use of Mouseton from 2003 onward. In-between licensee Gladstone (1993–99) usually left Mickey&#x27;s city unnamed, or—very rarely—referenced it as Duckburg, better known as Donald Duck&#x27;s hometown.)

Mouseton&#x27;s location in Calisota and its positioning with regard to Duckburg (the cities being not far from one another) were the subject of speculation early on, but have generally been treated consistently in American publications from 2003 onward.

In Disney comics published by Egmont (Scandinavia) and Abril (Brazil), Mickey lives in Duckburg—even though Mickey and Donald only rarely team up in shared comics adventures. The same tradition extends to Disney comics published in Germany by Egmont subdivision Ehapa (Duckburg is called &quot;Entenhausen&quot; in German), although the German comics have mentioned possible equivalents of Mouseton as neighboring towns or villages: &quot;Mausdorf&quot; (German for &quot;mouse village&quot;) and &quot;Mäuslingen&quot; (German equivalent to &quot;Mouseville&quot;).

In Germany, the Netherlands, Brazil and Scandinavia, local tradition has it that Mickey&#x27;s hometown is simply a different district of Duckburg. In Disney theme parks, the Roger Rabbit-inspired Toontown, a district in Los Angeles specifically for cartoon characters, is presented as Mickey&#x27;s home.

In animation, Mouseton is mentioned in the &quot;DuckTales&quot; reboot series, where one of the characters, Zan Owlson, graduated from Mouseton&#x27;s School of Business, the place appearing briefly in the episode &quot;The Ballad of Duke Baloney!&quot; during Owlson&#x27;s presentation.

=== Non-Mouseton continuity ===
In some 1920s and 1930s Disney press releases and magazines, Mickey was described as living in Hollywood—even though the rural setting of the actual cartoons and comics had little in common with the real Hollywood.

In the film &quot;Mr. Mouse Takes a Trip&quot; (1940) Mickey and Pluto live in the actual world city of Burbank, California, home of Walt Disney Studios.

In the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series, both the Mouseton and Duckburg characters live in a realm called &quot;Disney Town.&quot;

The Walt Disney Parks and Resorts modeled Mickey&#x27;s hometown and birthplace as Mickey&#x27;s Toontown. Occasional modern animated projects reference Toontown as well.

In the TV series &quot;Goof Troop&quot; (1992–1993) Goofy and Pete live in the fictional town of Spoonerville. The town also appears in the 1993 video game of the same name and in the two films based on the series: &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; (1995) and &quot;An Extremely Goofy Movie&quot; (2000).

In the TV series &quot;Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures&quot; (2017-2021) the characters live in the fictional town of Hot Dog Hills.

== Protagonists ==
===Mickey Mouse===

Mickey Mouse is an anthropomorphic mouse most often dressed in gloves, red shorts and yellow shoes. While typically given a modest and pleasant personality, he is often an enthusiastic and determined character, seeking new adventures, excitement and mysteries. He often serves as the de facto leader of his friends. He was introduced in the 1928 short film &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;.

===Minnie Mouse===

Minnie Mouse is Mickey&#x27;s female counterpart, an anthropomorphic mouse usually portrayed as his girlfriend who first appeared in the 1928 short film &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;. Originally characterized as a flapper, Minnie has often played Mickey&#x27;s damsel in distress. Her most frequent profession in early cartoons was a musician and songwriter.

===Donald Duck===

Donald Duck is Mickey&#x27;s short tempered friend who was first introduced in the 1934 short film &quot;The Wise Little Hen&quot;. Donald is an anthropomorphic duck who gets angry when characters are mocking him. He dates Daisy Duck and is the uncle of Huey, Dewey, and Louie.

===Daisy Duck===

Daisy Duck is Donald&#x27;s female counterpart, an anthropomorphic Duck usually portrayed as his girlfriend who first appeared in the 1940 short film &quot;Mr. Duck Steps Out&quot;. She sometimes gets upset with Donald when he loses his temper. Daisy has an equally dangerous temper but a much more sophisticated mien. She is also best friends with Minnie Mouse.

===Goofy===

Goofy (often also called Goofy Goof) is Mickey&#x27;s clumsy, dim-witted and well-meaning friend who was first introduced in the 1932 short film &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Revue&quot;. Goofy is an anthropomorphic dog who is accident-prone. In some stories he dates Clarabelle Cow while other times he is shown as a single parent. His original name was Dippy Dawg.

===Pluto===

Pluto is Mickey Mouse&#x27;s pet dog who was first introduced in the 1930 short film &quot;The Chain Gang&quot;, later appearing in &quot;The Picnic&quot; as Minnie&#x27;s dog Rover and in the 1931 short film &quot;The Moose Hunt&quot; under his current role as Mickey&#x27;s dog. Unlike the anthropomorphic Goofy, Pluto is a normal dog who walks on four legs and rarely speaks.

===Clarabelle Cow===

Clarabelle Cow is a tall, anthropomorphic cow who is Minnie Mouse&#x27;s friend and was introduced in the 1928 short film &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;. She is prone to gossip and occasionally plays a well-meaning but ineffective parent figure to Donald Duck. She has been known to date both Horace Horsecollar and Goofy.

===Horace Horsecollar===

Horace Horsecollar is a tall, anthropomorphic horse who is Mickey Mouse&#x27;s friend who first appeared in the 1929 short film &quot;The Plowboy&quot;. He is prone to bragging and practical joking. Before the appearance of Donald Duck and Goofy, Horace was Mickey Mouse&#x27;s usual sidekick. He is often seen as the boyfriend of Clarabelle Cow.

=== Oswald the Lucky Rabbit===

Oswald is an anthropomorphic black rabbit who first appeared in &quot;Trolley Troubles&quot; (1927). He is described metafictionally as Mickey&#x27;s older half &quot;brother&quot; in the video game &quot;Epic Mickey&quot;. This is a reference to the fact that Oswald was Walt Disney&#x27;s primary cartoon star before the creation of Mickey Mouse, though he was owned by Universal Pictures at the time. Disney&#x27;s removal from the Oswald series in 1928 led to Mickey&#x27;s creation. In 2006, The Walt Disney Company acquired the rights to Oswald, and have since used him in the &quot;Epic Mickey&quot; video game franchise. The game is unclear whether Mickey and Oswald are brothers; Yen Sid&#x27;s closing narration merely states that the wizard hopes the two heroes will come to think of each other as brothers.

==Family relations==
=== Mickey Mouse&#x27;s family ===
==== Felicity Fieldmouse ====
Felicity Fieldmouse (née Mouse) is Mickey&#x27;s older sister and the mother of Mickey&#x27;s twin nephews Morty and Ferdie. The character first appeared in Morty and Ferdie&#x27;s 1932 comics debut: there, she looks old and is not stated to be Mickey&#x27;s sister. Indeed, Mickey calls her &quot;Mrs. Fieldmouse&quot; as if she were an unrelated acquaintance, implying that Morty and Ferdie call Mickey &quot;uncle&quot; as a form of courtesy. Danish editor Egmont Publishing used the character again in seven stories published between 2000 and 2008, reimagining some aspects while refraining from declaring the old and the new character the same one. This new incarnation looks younger and is identified as Mickey&#x27;s sister. She is now named Felicity, a name that was kept in the American localization of these Danish stories. In Egmont production notes her husband is named Frank Fieldmouse, though the character has never appeared in a story.

==== Morty and Ferdie Fieldmouse ====

Mortimer &quot;Morty&quot; and Ferdinand &quot;Ferdie&quot; Fieldmouse are Mickey Mouse&#x27;s twin nephews. They first appeared in Floyd Gottfredson&#x27;s &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; Sunday page storyline titled &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Nephews&quot; (1932). Since then they have appeared in many comic strips and comic book stories starring Mickey Mouse and Pluto. Morty and Ferdy were first shown as wearing shirts, but no pants or underpants. Pants were later added to their wardrobe.

Ferdie disappeared from the Mickey Mouse comic strip in 1943 because Gottfredson thought the nephews were too much alike. He had plans to bring Ferdie back later as a bespectacled, intellectual, bookworm mouse with an Eton hat and coat with the explanation that he had been away at school. However, Gottfredson never got around to bringing Ferdie back and Morty remained in the strip alone. Morty was occasionally depicted with his best friend named Alvin and a sweetheart named Millie. Both were anthropomorphic dogs. Ferdie never vanished from comic book stories, however. In recent years, some of Morty and Ferdie&#x27;s comic book appearances have portrayed them as (very talented) football players on the team Riverside Rovers. Their mother is depicted as a supportive &quot;Soccer Mom.&quot; Morty &amp; Ferdie are also occasionally pitted against their antagonists Melody, Minnie Mouse&#x27;s niece and Pete&#x27;s twin hellion nephews, Pierino &amp; Pieretto. Morty should not be confused with Mickey Mouse&#x27;s originally proposed name &quot;Mortimer Mouse,&quot; or Mickey&#x27;s ofttimes rival of the same name Mortimer Mouse, or Minnie&#x27;s wealthy rancher Uncle Mortimer. Morty is a playable character on the PlayStation 2 game &quot;Disney Golf&quot;.

In pre-World War II children&#x27;s books produced by Disney, the nephews were usually called Morty and Monty. Earlier books contain three or more nephews with various names, including Maisie and Marmaduke.

In animation, Mickey&#x27;s nephews first appear in the 1933 &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; film &quot;Giantland&quot;, although the film shows Mickey with as many as 14 nephews at the same time. The following year the nephews appear again in &quot;Gulliver Mickey&quot;. The following film, &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Steam Roller&quot;, is the first to show Mickey with only two nephews, who can be presumed to be Morty and Ferdie, although they are unnamed in the film itself. This was two years after the twins debuted in the comic strip. Morty and Ferdie also make a cameo towards the end of 1938&#x27;s &quot;Boat Builders&quot; and appear again in 1983&#x27;s &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; in speaking roles, albeit at different ages as one of the twins took on the role of Tiny Tim. In 1999 they make a cameo in the two-part &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot; segment &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot;, which was used again in &quot;House of Mouse&quot;. They also appear in the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; episode &quot;The Scariest Story Ever: A Mickey Mouse Halloween Spooktacular!&quot;

==== Madeline Mouse ====
Madeline Mouse is Mickey&#x27;s blonde city cousin who appeared in &quot;Love Trouble&quot;, a strip serial that ran from April 14 to July 5, 1941. While referred to as blonde in the story itself, Madeline has also been coloured with straight yellow fur in some printings of the story.

==== Melinda Mouse ====
Melinda Mouse (original Italian name &quot;Topolinda&quot;) is Mickey Mouse&#x27;s aunt, created by Romano Scarpa in 1960 for his story &quot;The Chirikawa Necklace&quot;. Since 2004, she has become a regular recurring character in Italian Disney comics.

Melinda is a tall old lady with a long nose and she dresses in a very formal way. She wears a pair of earrings, but her ears are covered by hair. The colour of Melinda&#x27;s hair changes according to the colourists, but in recent stories, they appear blond. In her debut story, young Melinda has black hair.

According to &quot;The Chirikawa Necklace&quot;, Melinda took care of Mickey when he was a baby. But one day, (taking advantage of a moment of distraction by Melinda) a young Big Bad Pete and his girlfriend Trudy Van Tubb kidnapped a baby Mickey Mouse and Melinda was forced to exchange Mickey for her Indian necklace. Years later, Mickey and his friend Atomo Beep-Beep discovered the truth and retrieved Melinda&#x27;s necklace to her.

She is a lovely and cheerful person, and deeply attached to her nephew Mickey (with whom she shares a passion for mysteries and investigations) but the memory of baby Mickey&#x27;s kidnapping caused her to develop feelings of guilt, and a too protective attitude towards her nephew.

=== Minnie Mouse&#x27;s family ===
==== Marcus Mouse ====
Marcus Mouse is Minnie&#x27;s father. He first appears as a farmer in the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; comic strip story line &quot;Mr. Slicker and the Egg Robbers,&quot; first published between September 22 and December 26, 1930. He has also appeared in some English stories from 1930s Mickey Mouse Annuals.

==== Marshal Mouse and Matilda Mouse ====
Marshal Mouse and Matilda Mouse are Minnie&#x27;s grandparents.

==== Millie and Melody Mouse ====

Millie and Melody Mouse are Minnie Mouse&#x27;s twin nieces. Minnie has had an inconsistent list of nieces. In Europe and Brazil, most often a single niece is depicted, consistently named &quot;Melodia&quot; (Melody). She is a Disney Studio creation by Jim Fletcher in the mid-sixties whose primary &quot;task&quot; seems to be to drive Morty &amp; Ferdie crazy.

However, in at least one other Italian or Brazilian tale Minnie did have another niece named Zizi (whether this was the name of Melody&#x27;s twin or just another name for Melody is unknown). In America, Minnie&#x27;s twin nieces have appeared under two names: Millie and Melody and Pammy and Tammy. Although the writer of these comics is unknown, they were both drawn by Paul Murry, who rarely worked with characters that sported the same names even if they ostensibly were the same characters. In Italy, there is another set of twin nieces, Lily &amp; Tiny, who are in their teen years. These teenage nieces have yet to appear in comics printed in the USA.

It is reported that another name is attributed in American comics giving Minnie&#x27;s single niece the name of Molly. Another set of nieces appear in an early Mickey Mouse book from the 1940s as triplets calling themselves &quot;Dolly, Polly &amp; Molly,&quot; while a lone niece attributed to Mickey appears in the cartoon &quot;Gulliver Mickey&quot; (1934) named &quot;Maisie&quot; (listed in &quot;Mickey Mouse: His Life and Times&quot; (Harper &amp; Row, 1986)).

The only possible film appearance of any niece is in 1983&#x27;s &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol,&quot; where Mickey Mouse, as Bob Cratchit, has a daughter. In this film Morty &amp; Ferdie are said to have played Cratchit&#x27;s two sons (including one as Tiny Tim), and since Melody seems to be the most consistent name used for any niece attributed to Minnie, it is probable that it was Melody who played the role of Bob Cratchit&#x27;s daughter.

Millie &amp; Melody both appear in &quot;Minnie&#x27;s Bow-Toons&quot; on Disney Junior, and are voiced by Avalon Robbins.

==== Uncle Mortimer ====
Uncle Mortimer, created by Walt Disney and Floyd Gottfredson for the comic strip, is Minnie&#x27;s rancher uncle from whom she inherits an estate. He first appeared in the &quot;Mickey Mouse in Death Valley&quot; story line (1930). After that, he returned in several other Mickey Mouse comic strip adventures of the 1930s, in which Gottfredson gave him a markedly different appearance. He has occasionally appeared in more modern comics. He must not be confused with one of Mickey&#x27;s antagonists, also called Mortimer Mouse.

==== Minnie&#x27;s other nieces ====
Minnie Mouse has a variety of nieces besides Millie and Melody.
* Angela Mouse (Minnie&#x27;s best friend)
* An unnamed baby niece (appeared in the 1944-02-26 strip by Bill Walsh)
* Giselle (French niece who appeared in the 1956-11-24 strip by Bill Walsh)
* Mildred (niece who appeared in the 1955-05-15 strip by Bill Walsh)

=== Donald Duck&#x27;s family ===
==== Huey, Dewey, and Louie ====

Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck are Donald&#x27;s mischief-making nephews who provoke Donald with his famous temper. They first appeared in 1937.

==== Scrooge McDuck ====

Scrooge McDuck is Donald&#x27;s wealthy uncle. He lives in the city of Duckburg and is of Scottish descent. Scrooge first appeared in 1947.
He is best known for diving into his pool of money, a recurring gag in the DuckTales series.

==== Ludwig Von Drake ====

Ludwig Von Drake is Donald&#x27;s eccentric uncle who is a resident scientist, lecturer, and psychiatrist. He was introduced in 1961, as part of Walt Disney&#x27;s NBC television special.

=== Goofy&#x27;s family ===
==== Max Goof ====

Max Goof (also known as &quot;Goofy Junior&quot; in 1950s short films) is Goofy&#x27;s teenage son. He is a protagonist of the &quot;Goof Troop&quot; TV series (1992–1993) and of the feature film &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; and its sequel &quot;An Extremely Goofy Movie&quot;. He has also made a few comics appearances, most of which were based on the TV series.

==== Gilbert Goof ====
Gilbert Goof is Goofy&#x27;s nephew in Disney comic book appearances, and a smarter counterpart for Goofy. He was created by Bill Wright (plot and art) and first introduced in the Dell Four Color # 562 (1954). He made numerous comics appearances in the 1950s and 1960s. At one point, he became Super Goof&#x27;s sidekick, calling himself &quot;Super Gilly&quot; (&quot;Super Goof&quot; #5 in &quot;The Twister Resisters&quot;). He has since appeared in various Italian comics stories.

==== Grandma Goofy ====
Grandma Goofy is Goofy&#x27;s elderly but energetic grandmother, who first appeared in a 1944 &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; Sunday page. She has made various appearances in American Mickey and Goofy stories, as well as in Italian stories. Although Grandma Goofy has not yet made a true animated appearance, Goofy impersonated her in the episode &quot;Goofy&#x27;s Grandma&quot; of the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; television series.

==== Arizona Goof ====
Arizona Goof (original Italian name: &quot;Indiana Pipps&quot;) is an archaeologist and a cousin of Goofy, being a clear parody of Indiana Jones, who appears exclusively in Italian comics. The character was created in 1988 by Bruno Sarda (plot) and Maria Luisa Uggetti (art) in the story &quot; Topolino &amp; Pippo in: I predatori del tempio perduto&quot; (&quot;Topolino&quot; n° 1724). Arizona has a rare habit of not using beds, doors, or stairs. Instead, he sleeps in a tent, enters and exits houses through windows and climbs floors by a rope. Arizona is fond of a specific brand of liquorice candy (the brand is called &quot;Negritas&quot; in original Italian language version, &quot;Tuju&quot; in the Finnish language translation), which he never travels without and is addicted to the taste of, but which everyone else finds horrible. Arizona&#x27;s car is an old jeep which he has named affectionately as Gippippa (Jeep + Pippo, Goofy&#x27;s Italian name). Arizona has a rival archaeologist, Dr. Kranz, who is greedy and shameless and not above resorting to criminal behaviour. Arizona and Goofy look almost identical, which has been used as a plot device, when Goofy has masqueraded as Arizona to fool Dr. Kranz. For the readers&#x27; benefit, there is one small difference: Arizona has hairs dangling from his floppy ears, whereas Goofy&#x27;s floppy ears are smooth.

Arizona Goof received his English name in his first American comics appearance (1991). In a couple of 2005–2006 appearances, the character was renamed &quot;Arizona Dipp&quot;. But more recent uses (Disney Digicomics, 2009–2010) have restored his traditional English name.

== Antagonists ==

===Pete===

Pete (also called Peg-Leg Pete or Black Pete among other names) is a large, overweight anthropomorphic cat. He is the most recurring antagonist in Mickey Mouse stories. He was first introduced in 1925 as a bear. His character ranges from a hardened criminal to an ethical menace: depending on the context, he is either Mickey&#x27;s archenemy or a simple nuisance. In the earlier comic strip storyline he was paired with Sylvester Shyster before evolving into the main villain. In the &quot;Goof Troop&quot; TV series and subsequent film adaptations, he is depicted as Goofy&#x27;s exploitative friend and neighbor.

=== Kat Nipp ===

Kat Nipp (not to be confused with Harvey Comics character Katnip), his name a play on the word catnip, is a villainous anthropomorphic cat. Kat Nipp is an often-drunk countryside tough guy who is a rival of Mickey Mouse.

Nipp made his debut in the animated short &quot;The Opry House&quot; (1929), in which he posed as a snake for a snake-charming act—continuing to smoke his pipe all the while. Nipp&#x27;s other two appearances in animation also came in 1929, with &quot;When the Cat&#x27;s Away&quot; and &quot;The Karnival Kid&quot;. The latter film introduced Nipp&#x27;s habit of physically abusing Mickey, here by stretching out Mickey&#x27;s nose to a ridiculous length. Kat Nipp is often mistaken for Pete.

Kat Nipp reappeared in a 1931 sequence of the Mickey Mouse newspaper comic strip (in which his friend Barnacle Bill, a sailor who is an expert in untying knots, appears). Kat Nipp was also used in the strips produced in the United Kingdom for the Mickey Mouse Annual. The character quickly faded away and has made only a handful of comics appearances since the mid-1930s.

Kat Nipp appears in the video game &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot; (2018), appearing in the minigame &quot;The Karnival Kid&quot; with his appearance from the short film of the same name, among the characters who order menus from Sora.

=== Sylvester Shyster ===
Sylvester Shyster is a crooked lawyer and evil criminal mastermind who generally teams up with Pete. The character has been described by some as a weasel or a rat (the latter being Gottfredson&#x27;s own interpretation), but his ears suggest that he is rather an anthropomorphic canine.

He first appeared in the comic strip adventure &quot;Mickey Mouse in Death Valley&quot;, the first real Mickey Mouse continuity, which was partially written by Walt Disney and drawn by Win Smith and other artists, before being taken over by Floyd Gottfredson (plot and art). In this story, Sylvester Shyster was a crooked lawyer who attempted, with the help of his henchman Pete, to deprive Minnie Mouse of her inheritance.

Shyster and Pete have been causing trouble for Mickey and his friends since then. Shyster is generally depicted as the duo&#x27;s brain, with Pete acting as the brawn. After Shyster&#x27;s first appearance, Gottfredson made no further references to his profession as a lawyer, apart from his name. Later creators occasionally referenced Shyster&#x27;s role as a lawyer, with one story (&quot;Trial and Error,&quot; 2007) forcing Shyster to defend Mickey himself in an overseas courtroom. After 1934, Shyster disappeared for a time, leaving Pete as Mickey&#x27;s main recurring antagonists. He made comebacks in 1942, 1950 and again in various 1960s Italian-created stories. More recently, publisher Egmont Creative A/S (in Denmark) revived Shyster as a regular character, a capacity in which he continues today.

Although Sylvester Shyster has not made an animated appearance in any Disney production, he appears briefly in the episode &quot;Who Ate Wally&#x27;s Waffles?&quot; of the series &quot;Paradise PD&quot; at the entrance of Disney World, being to date the only appearance in animation of the character.

=== The Mad Doctor ===

The Mad Doctor (also known as Dr. XXX) is a human mad scientist who serves as an infrequent antagonist of Mickey&#x27;s. He first appeared in his self-titled short, in which he attempted to operate on Pluto by attaching his body to that of a chicken; this entire sequence turned out to be a dream.

The Mad Doctor makes a cameo appearance in the Roger Rabbit short &quot;Tummy Trouble&quot;, where a photo of him can be seen on the hospital wall.

He appears as an antagonist in some video games, being a boss enemy in &quot;Mickey Mania&quot;, a major antagonist in &quot;Epic Mickey&quot; and its sequel &quot;Epic Mickey 2&quot;, and an enemy in a mini-game of &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot;.

=== Professors Ecks, Doublex, and Triplex ===
Professors Eck, Doublex, and Triplex are the trio of ape mad scientists. The characters were created by Floyd Gottfredson (plot and art) in the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; comic strip in the &quot;Blaggard Castle&quot; storyline (1932-1933). Ecks is menacing black monkey, Doublex looks like him, but with light skin and wild black eyes, and Triplex is a more monstrous looking ape with long messy hair and bare feet. Triplex is the leader of the trio, and Ecks and Doublex find him frightening. While Gottfredson didn&#x27;t mention any familial relationship, most later comics have presented the trio as brothers.

Gottfredson never featured the three professors in another story after &quot;Blaggard Castle&quot;, but they were memorable enough to return in stories under other authors in the 1970s.

Professor Ecks was originally considered for the role of the mad scientist in &quot;Runaway Brain&quot;, but it was later changed to a new character, Doctor Frankenollie.

=== Eli Squinch ===
Eli Squinch is an evil miser who first appeared as a villain in the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; comic strip in the &quot;Bobo the Elephant&quot; storyline (1934) as the abusive owner of an elephant which Mickey later forced Squinch to sell him. Squinch returned in several more storylines: originally depicted as an unscrupulous businessman, he evolved into an all-out criminal, playing alongside Pete a role similar to Sylvester Shyster&#x27;s in earlier strips. He has reappeared sporadically in additional Disney comics stories up to the present day. His most recent United States appearance was in &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; No. 321 (2016), published by IDW.

=== Doctor Vulter ===
Doctor Vulter is an anthropomorphic ape, resembling a gorilla. The character was created by Ted Osborne (plot) and Floyd Gottfredson (plot and art) in the story &quot;Mickey Mouse and the Pirate Submarine&quot;, published in the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; daily strip from September 1935 to January 1936. He is a megalomaniacal pirate captain and mad scientist, somewhat modeled after Jules Verne&#x27;s Captain Nemo character. Using a futuristic submarine and a small army of henchmen, he plagues the seas by stealing various ships which he aims to use for his plans of world conquest. His principal weapon is a machine in the form of a large claw which gives off magnetic-like energy: by placing it against a ship&#x27;s hull Vulter can turn the whole metal ship into one large magnet which sticks weapons to the wall, making them useless.

Vulter&#x27;s Germanic-sounding name, his uniform and monocle, as well as his plans of world domination and militaristic gang, are obvious echoes of the Nazi menace of the time.

After being defeated by Mickey, Vulter never appeared again in American stories. He was later used by Italian authors, starting with the 1959 story &quot;Topolino e il ritorno dell&#x27;artiglio magnetico&quot; (&quot;Mickey Mouse and the Return of the Magnetic Claw&quot;) by Guido Martina (plot) and Giulio Chierchini (art). The character was further elaborated in this story by the claim that he never drew plans of his inventions but kept it all in his mind; this proved a bit of a problem when he suffered from amnesia. He returned occasionally and is still used from time to time by European authors.

=== Mortimer Mouse ===
Mortimer Mouse – not to be confused with Minnie Mouse&#x27;s uncle also named Mortimer Mouse – is introduced in the 1936 cartoon short &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Rival&quot;, as Mickey&#x27;s competitor for Minnie&#x27;s affections. The year &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Rival&quot; was produced, Floyd Gottfredson also used the character as an antagonist in one of the comic strip&#x27;s storylines. In the comics, this Mortimer was briefly renamed Montmorency Rodent (pronounced &quot;Ro-Dawn&quot;), in an attempt to differentiate him from the pre-existing uncle, but the new name did not stick. Mickey&#x27;s rival was once again called Mortimer in later comics – and in the animated series &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot; and &quot;House of Mouse&quot;, where he used the catchphrase, &quot;Ha-cha-cha!&quot;.

In &quot;House of Mouse&quot; and &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot;, Mortimer as Mickey&#x27;s rival is voiced by Maurice LaMarche, doing an exaggerated impersonation of Jon Lovitz. As Minnie&#x27;s boss in &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Once Upon a Christmas&quot;, he was voiced by Jeff Bennett. Mortimer Mouse also appeared in a non-speaking cameo in the &quot;Mickey Mouse Clubhouse&quot; episode &quot;Minnie&#x27;s Birthday&quot;, sitting beneath a tree, playing a guitar. He later appeared in the &quot;Mickey Mouse Clubhouse&quot; episode &quot;Super Adventure&quot; as a villain where he intends to shrink the clubhouse. Bennett reprised his role as Mortimer in the 2018 &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; short &quot;A Pete Scorned&quot;. He also appeared in &quot;Mickey and the Roadster Racers&quot; as Morty McCool.

===The Phantom Blot===

The Phantom Blot is a mysterious enemy of Mickey Mouse who wears a body-length black sheet. Created in 1939 in Floyd Gottfredson&#x27;s comic strip, the Phantom Blot became a very recurring character in European comics where he is one of Mickey&#x27;s archenemies, second only to Pete. He was also reused, to a lesser extent, in American stories.

The Phantom Blot prefers being an ominous mastermind in the background, pulling strings and organising schemes, to engaging in physical criminal jobs.

The Phantom Blot is a master of disguise. He uses disguises to fool Mickey Mouse and the police, sometimes even appearing right in front of them without being noticed. When escaping the scene, the Phantom Blot often leaves a trademark &quot;business card&quot; - a sheet of white paper with a black splodge of ink on it.

When unmasked, the Phantom Blot is an anthropomorphic dog. He has a gaunt face with a long nose and a long, thin moustache. Phantom Blot&#x27;s unmasked look was reportedly based on the features of Walt Disney himself.

The Phantom Blot and Pete are often bitter rivals, as both want to be recognised as the city&#x27;s greatest criminal mastermind, and to get the most money out of the deal. However, some stories have shown them teaming up with each other.

The Phantom Blot made his animated debut in the &quot;DuckTales&quot; episode &quot;All Ducks on Deck&quot; voiced by Frank Welker. He is shown to be an agent of F.O.W.L.

The Phantom Blot appears as an antagonist in the TV series &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot; and its spinoff &quot;House of Mouse&quot; voiced by John O&#x27;Hurley.

An altered, monstrous version of the Phantom Blot, known as the &quot;Shadow Blot&quot;, serves as the antagonist of the first &quot;Epic Mickey&quot; game. The Phantom Blot seemingly meets this creature in the city&#x27;s museum when unlocking a dimensional portal, in the story &quot;The Blot and The Blob&quot;.

The Phantom Blot made a cameo appearance in the episode &quot;Sock Burglar&quot; from the TV series &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot;.

The Phantom Blot is a recurring antagonist during the third season of the &quot;DuckTales&quot; reboot, voiced by Giancarlo Esposito. While his history as a member of F.O.W.L. remains intact, this version came from a village that Magica De Spell attacked.

=== Willie the Giant ===

Willie is a giant who appeared in the Disney cartoons &quot;Mickey and the Beanstalk&quot; (from the film &quot;Fun and Fancy Free&quot;, voiced by Billy Gilbert) and &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; (voiced by Will Ryan). He has also made cameo appearances in &quot;House of Mouse&quot; and &quot;Mickey Mouse Clubhouse&quot;. He is incredibly powerful, demonstrating amazing magic powers such as flight, invisibility and shapeshifting. Despite this, he is portrayed as immature and dimwitted, given his fondness for toys and inability to pronounce certain words, such as &quot;pistachio&quot;. His favorite dish is implied to be chocolate pot roast with pistachios, given his overweight appearance. In other words, he is much dumber than the original giant that he is based on from &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot;.

In &quot;Mickey and the Beanstalk&quot;, Willie serves as the primary villain. In &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;, he is portrayed in a much more positive light, playing the role of the Ghost of Christmas Present who helps show Ebenezer Scrooge (Scrooge McDuck) the error of his ways. He makes a brief cameo in the 1988 film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; on a poster in a movie theater in Toontown. Willie is also a minor recurring character in the &quot;Mickey Mouse Clubhouse&quot; children&#x27;s series. Here, he is friends with Mickey. Willie still lives in the sky, only this time in a giant farmhouse.

In &quot;Mickey Mouse Funhouse&quot;, Willie lives in the medieval location of Majestica where his farm is in the Cloud Kingdom. His Land of Myth and Legend counterpart is Woodsman Willie, a woodsman who lives in the forests of the Land of Myth and Legend. Will Ryan recorded some dialogue before his death with the last episode he voiced Willie in was &quot;Witchy Worries&quot;. Starting in the episode &quot;Tooth or Consequences&quot;, Willie is now currently voiced by Brock Powell.

=== The Rhyming Man ===
The Rhyming Man is a villain who debuted in a comic strip storyline, &quot;The Atombrella and the Rhyming Man&quot; (May–October, 1948), written by Bill Walsh with art by Floyd Gottfredson. His name derives from the fact that he always talks in rhymes. A spy working for an unspecified foreign nation, the Rhyming Man tried to steal Eega Beeva&#x27;s anti-atomic invention but was ultimately foiled by Mickey Mouse and Eega Beeva. An unusually dark and violent character by Disney comics standards, he was shown to actually murder one of his underlings. He was also depicted as possessing near-superhuman strength, the origin of which was never explained. Though never used again by American authors, the Rhyming Man was reused in Italian comic books first in a 1994 story where he appeared to have reformed, then in 2008 as the central antagonist of the four-part science-fiction story &quot;Topolino e il mondo che verrà&quot; in which he returned to his villainous roots.

=== Weasels ===
The Weasels are characters that originally appeared in the segment &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; of the film &quot;The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad&quot; (1949), where they act as antagonists of the story by deceiving the main character by selling him a stolen car. The first weasel is voiced by an uncredited Leslie Denison and the second weasel is voiced by an uncredited Edmond Stevens. After this appearance, they became recurring characters in Disney animated productions related to Mickey and his friends. Usually they are presented as thin brown Weasels who wear a sweater, pants and a cap.

A Weasel appears as a mugger in the Goofy short film &quot;How to Be a Detective&quot; (1952), voiced by Gerald Mohr.

In &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; (1983), two Weasels appear as gravediggers in the graveyard, burying Ebenezer Scrooge (Scrooge McDuck), and making fun of the fact that there weren&#x27;t any mourners at his funeral, or for that matter any friends to bid him farewell. These weasels are voiced by Wayne Allwine and Will Ryan.

In &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (1988), five Weasels partially based on those of &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;, with different appearances and personalities, form the so-called &quot;Toon Patrol&quot;, acting as the secondary antagonists of the story under the service of Judge Doom. The weasels consist of Smart Ass (voiced by David Lander), Stupid (voiced by Fred Newman), Wheezy (voiced by June Foray), Greasy (voiced by Charles Fleischer), and Psycho (also voice by Charles Fleischer). Each of them meets its demise at the end of the film, literally dying of laughter or being dissolved in Dip.

In &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot; (1990), the Weasels appear as royal guards, acting as the secondary antagonists under the orders of the Captain of the Guard (Pete). One weasel is voiced by Bill Farmer while other two weasels are voiced by Charlie Adler.

In the TV series &quot;DuckTales&quot;, two Weasels appear as henchmen of Flintheart Glomgold in the episode &quot;Horse Scents&quot;. Two other Weasels from Australia appear in the episode &quot;Back Out in the Outback&quot; voiced by Will Ryan.

In the series &quot;Bonkers&quot;, a Weasel makes a cameo appearance in the episode &quot;The 29th Page&quot; as a suspect in a police lineup while in the episode &quot;Get Wacky&quot;, a Weasel named Wacky (voiced by Rip Taylor) has a more prominent role as the main antagonist of the episode, having an appearance that more closely resembles the Weasels from &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;.

In the series &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot;, a Weasel appears in the cartoon &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Mechanical House&quot; as a realtor (voiced by Jeff Bennett) selling a modern mechanical house to Mickey. The Weasels make several appearances in the series &quot;House of Mouse&quot;. Some Weasels have appeared in the series with different appearances and professions, like one appearing in the episode &quot;The Three Caballeros&quot; working as Donald&#x27;s lawyer (voiced by Jim Cummings) or another appearing in the episode &quot;Rent Day&quot; working as a cheese shop salesman (voiced by Jeff Bennett) during a flashback where Mickey paid him the rent money needed to pay the landlord Pete for some cheese. In the episode &quot;Pete&#x27;s House of Villains&quot; after Pete began to take over the club, Pete put the weasels (all voiced by Jim Cummings) to work as waiters replacing the Penguins, but they robbed customers while doing so. As Pete fires a weasel among the other villains who were doing illegal stuff, he tells Pete &quot;You can&#x27;t fire me, I have friends in high places&quot;. Pete then gets crushed by a safe dropped by some other weasels.

In the series &quot;The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse&quot;, the Weasels appear in the episode &quot;Cheese Wranglers&quot; as bandits working for Pete. They are voiced by Chris Diamantopoulos and Bill Farmer.

The TV series &quot;Mickey Mouse Funhouse&quot; features the Weasel Trio that is led by Wheezelene (voiced by Jenifer Lewis) and consisting of Cheezel (voiced by Richard Kind) and Sneezel (voiced by Brock Powell). Cheezel is the shortest of the trio and Sneezel is the largest of the trio. They appear on each of the Adventure Worlds and often cause all sorts of mischief and wrongdoing which always ends with Mickey and his friends thwarting them and setting them straight.

In the video game &quot;Mickey Mania&quot;, Weasels appear as enemies in the level based on &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot;, with some throwing knives and others throwing arrows. A Weasel appears in the video game &quot;Mickey Mouse Kindergarten&quot;, where after stealing Chief O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s cap, Mickey must find him hiding in an alley.

The Weasels act as the main antagonists in the video game &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Speedway USA&quot;, kidnapping Pluto to steal the diamond-encrusted collar he is wearing, so Mickey and his gang embark on an adventure around the world to find the Weasels and rescue Pluto, until in the game&#x27;s epilogue the Weasels are arrested.

In the video game &quot;Mickey Saves the Day&quot;, several Weasels appear as Pete&#x27;s henchmen in his plan to become mayor of the town, working for him as policemen or security guards.

=== Scuttle ===
Scuttle, called Weasel or Catfoot in some stories, is the weasel sidekick and right-hand man of Mickey Mouse&#x27;s nemesis Pete. He looks up to Pete and thinks of him as the greatest criminal mastermind ever. However, Scuttle himself is not very bright and usually fails to understand Pete&#x27;s plans and orders, to the latter&#x27;s annoyance. Physically, Scuttle is much slimmer than the overweight Pete: he has a long face and is generally depicted with a bushy beard. Some series have shown Scuttle as being more educated than Pete in some areas. For example, one comic book story where the two were stealing art objects showed that Scuttle is an educated art critic, unlike Pete who only cares for the monetary value. Scuttle has often teamed up with another sidekick-type criminal named Dum-Dum. The two have sometimes worked together as henchmen for Pete, or on their own. Scuttle was created by artist Paul Murry and an unidentified writer in 1951. He first appeared in the comic book story &quot;Donald Duck Captures the Range Rustlers&quot;.

=== Beagle Boys ===

The Beagle Boys are a family of thieves, mainly associated with the Donald Duck universe, although they have occasionally served as Mickey&#x27;s enemies in some comics, and some animated productions such as the film &quot;Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers&quot; (2004), or the episode &quot;Touchdown and Out&quot; (2017) of the television series &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; and the episode &quot;Keep on Rollin&#x27;&quot; (2020) of its spin-off &quot;The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse&quot;, or as Goofy&#x27;s rivals in their animated debut in &quot;Sport Goofy in Soccermania&quot; (1987).

=== Trudy Van Tubb ===
Trudy Van Tubb is an obese anthropomorphic cat, the girlfriend of Pete, with whom she usually shares the profession of delinquent. She has a similar size and body shape to Pete, but her hair is depicted as grey or orange depending on the stories, while Pete&#x27;s hair is black. Trudy is not very proficient as a criminal but she is a skilled cook and Pete enjoys her cooking.

Trudy is very devoted to Pete and often gets jealous of Minnie Mouse and other women Pete kidnaps for ransom. When the two get caught, Trudy often gets away with a more lenient sentence because of her lesser involvement.

Trudy was created by Romano Scarpa in 1960 for the story &quot;The Chirikawa Necklace&quot;. She has since appeared exclusively, though very regularly, in Italian comic book stories.

===Emil Eagle===

Emil Eagle is a mad scientist and, as his name suggests, an anthropomorphic eagle, who first appeared in 1966 in the Donald Duck universe as a rival for Gyro Gearloose. He has since appeared alternatively in the Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse universes. In the latter universe, he is a recurring antagonist for Mickey Mouse and, in particular, for Goofy in his Super Goof incarnation, in which case Emil Eagle becomes a kind of Lex Luthor.

===Dangerous Dan and Idgit the Midget===
&quot;Dangerous&quot; Dan McBoo and Idgit (sometimes spelled &quot;Idjit&quot;) &quot;the Midget&quot; are a pair of criminals created by Paul Murry in the 1966 comics story &quot;Treasure of Oomba Loomba&quot;. The large and overweight Dangerous Dan is the brawn of the duo while the balding and diminutive Idgit is its brain. They appeared as recurring antagonists of Mickey Mouse in various comic book stories.

=== Professor Nefarious ===
Professor Nefarious (a parody of professor Moriarty; not to be confused with Doctor Nefario from Illumination&#x27;s &quot;Despicable Me&quot; franchise) is a villain who origins in the 1975 comic book &quot;The Case of the Pea Soup Burglaries&quot;. He is the Sleuth&#x27;s arch-enemy. A London-based criminal mastermind, Nefarious sees himself as a &quot;teacher of crime&quot; for his three henchmen-pupils Fliplip, Sidney and Armadillo. Their hideout is a rundown townhouse with the words &quot;University of Criminal Sciences&quot; written on its front door. While Nefarious is reasonably smart (although his own megalomania sometimes hinders his plans), his three accomplices are thoroughly inept comical villains. Mickey and the Sleuth imprison the gang at the end of each story, although Nefarious himself generally manages to escape. Nefarious never realizes that the Sleuth is totally clueless and that the Sleuth&#x27;s assistant Mickey Mouse is the one who actually foils him.

===Portis===
Portis (original Italian name &quot;Plottigat&quot;) is an anthropomorphic cat, created by Romano Scarpa in the 1977 story &quot;Topolino e il Pippo-Lupo&quot;. He is Pete&#x27;s &quot;mad scientist&quot; cousin. Depicted as an arrogant and megalomaniacal criminal mastermind, Portis is often Pete and Trudy&#x27;s accomplice but he occasionally works on his own or with other villains such as the Phantom Blot. The character has appeared exclusively in Italian comics stories.

=== Charlie Doublejoke ===
Charlie Doublejoke (original Italian name &quot;Vito Doppioscherzo&quot;) is a criminal genius with a penchant for elaborate jokes and pranks. An anthropomorphic dog, he was created in 2004 by Casty (plot) and Massimo de Vita (art) and has since been a recurring antagonist in Italian comics stories. Besides his signature laugh &quot;Wah-wah-wah&quot;, a characteristic of his is the bowler hat that he does not only like to wear, but that also informs the shape of his transportation devices.

In a manner similar to the Joker, Charlie Doublejoke often not only pulls pranks on Mickey and the police, but betrays his own partners in crime as well, escaping alone with the booty.

He is so manipulative and charismatic that he managed to fool the entirety of Mouseton into thinking he was a good guy more than once, with Mickey usually being the only one skeptical of him (according to his debut story &quot;The Magnificent Doublejoke&quot;, they were schoolmates until Charlie&#x27;s habits of bullying others had gone so far that he was expelled from school).

== Other supporting characters ==

=== Ortensia the Cat ===
Ortensia is the girlfriend of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. She appeared in the Oswald shorts starting with &quot;The Banker&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1927; Lost cartoon), replacing Oswald&#x27;s former love interest, a much more feminine and sultry rabbit named Fanny in production materials. Ortensia&#x27;s original name during the production of the Oswald shorts was Sadie, as referenced in the title of the animated short &quot;Sagebrush Sadie&quot; (1928; Lost cartoon). The names for Oswald&#x27;s love interests were never widely publicized, which is likely the reason she was given a new name in &quot;Epic Mickey&quot;, following the alliteration pattern of Mickey and Minnie&#x27;s mirrored relationship. Often in the original Oswald shorts, Oswald would compete with Pete for her affection. She also appeared in Oswald shorts produced by Charles Mintz and later Walter Lantz. In the Lantz shorts, she was called &quot;Kitty&quot;. To add some confusion, copyright synopses of some Mintz and Lantz shorts erroneously refer to Ortensia/Kitty as Fanny.

=== Percy and Patricia Pigg ===
Percy and Patricia Pigg (sometimes the surname being written as &quot;Pig&quot;) are a married couple of anthropomorphic pigs. Percy made his debut in 1929 in the short &quot;The Opry House&quot;, Patricia debuting that same year in &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Follies&quot;, also Percy&#x27;s second appearance, and the only short in which both characters appear together. After that, Percy appeared in the short films &quot;The Barnyard Concert&quot; (1930), &quot;The Chain Gang&quot; (1930) and &quot;Traffic Troubles&quot; (1931), while Patricia appeared in &quot;The Shindig&quot; (1930), &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Revue&quot; (1932) and &quot;The Whoopee Party&quot; (1932).

After their appearances in short films, they started appearing in comics, but the two characters did not appear again in animation until 1983, in &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;, briefly appearing dancing at Fezzywig&#x27;s party.

Percy appears in the video game &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot; (2018) in the minigame &quot;Taxi Troubles&quot; (based on &quot;Traffic Troubles&quot;), where he is one of the characters that Sora must pick up in his taxi.

=== Butch ===
Butch is an anthropomorphic dog. Butch appeared as a gangster in &quot;Mr. Slicker and the Egg Robbers&quot;. A sympathetic criminal, he eventually reformed, became Mickey&#x27;s friend and remained in the strip as a supporting character until June 1931. He was revived in the 1990s as a member of Mickey&#x27;s supporting cast in European Disney comics.

=== Gideon Goat ===
Gideon Goat, or Giddy Goat, is an anthropomorphic goat, a supporting character in the Mickey Mouse comic strips of the 1930s. Gideon first appeared in the 1930 Mickey Mouse Book No. 1. He appeared in various American and European printed Disney comics until 1938. He was usually characterized as a farmer or the local sheriff. Gideon is married to a female anthropomorphic goat named Gertie (presumably Gertrude) who appeared in many early Mickey Mouse comics, primarily as a background character.

Promotional materials for the 1935 animated short &quot;The Band Concert&quot; include Giddy Goat as one of the characters. In the released film, he was replaced by an unnamed trombonist dog character.

Floyd Gottfredson made regular use of the character in his comic strips and later artists sometimes borrowed the character.

=== Clara Cluck ===

Clara Cluck debuted in 1934 in the Mickey Mouse cartoon &quot;Orphan&#x27;s Benefit&quot;. Since then she has appeared as a semi-regular character in the Mickey Mouse cartoons. In the comic books she is shown in Duck universe as Daisy Duck&#x27;s best friend. Clara has been a member of Mickey&#x27;s original farmyard gang since the beginning of his career, although she is seen less often than Clarabelle Cow and Horace Horsecollar. She originally was voiced by Florence Gill and later by Russi Taylor and Kaitlyn Robrock.

Clara&#x27;s singing is meant to be a caricature of the Bel canto style of opera singing popular at the time of her appearance. Some of her arias are clearly modelled on those of &quot;Tosca&quot;. Her last major appearance was as one of the musicians in &quot;Symphony Hour&quot;. Curiously, although she is seen in the rehearsal scenes at the beginning, she is not seen in the performance scenes at the end.

In Disney comics she has been shown to date Gus Goose on very few occasions, and in the initial appearance of Panchito Pistoles she was the object of his affections.

As with other Disney characters, she was given small cameos in &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; (1983), &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (1988), and &quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot; (2023).

In television, she had some appearances in &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot; (1999), where she is presented as Daisy Duck&#x27;s neighbor. She appeared occasionally in &quot;House of Mouse&quot; (2001). In one episode of that series, &quot;Double Date Don&quot;, she fell in love with Donald Duck and aggressively pursued him by puckering her lips in front of him, forcing him to dance with her, wearing dresses and posing provocatively to lure him in. At one point she even grabs Donald and forcibly, yet passionately, kisses him full on the lips. She almost tricked Donald into marrying her but Daisy stopped the wedding in time. She also had appeared to put Minnie Mouse in jail for driving her car through Daisy&#x27;s house to deliver an apple pie of hers. She also appeared as a recurring character in the series &quot;Mickey and the Roadster Racers&quot; (2017), where she is the mother of two chicks named Cleo and Clifford.

Clara made a cameo appearance in the Timeless River world of &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; with many other Disney characters like Clarabelle Cow and Horace Horsecollar as one of the world&#x27;s citizens, being one of the rare media in which the character is seen speaking (her dialogue being seen in speech balloons).

She also makes an appearance in the &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Boo to You Parade&quot; and for rare meet and greets at Walt Disney World&#x27;s Magic Kingdom.

=== Doctor Einmug ===
Doctor Einmug is a scientist who was created by Ted Osborne (plot) and Floyd Gottfredson (plot and art) in the story &quot;Island in the Sky&quot;, published in the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; comic strip from November 1936 to April 1937. He is a large man who wears a big white beard and laboratory coat.

Doctor Einmug specializes in atomic physics and speaks in a German-like accent which was probably a nod towards Albert Einstein, &quot;mug&quot; also being a pun on &quot;stein&quot;. His introductory story, &quot;Island in the Sky&quot;, raises many issues about the benefits and dangers of atomic physics just a few years before the first atom bombs were developed.

After that, Einmug did not re-appear in American comics for almost 50 years, but he was used in Italian ones, starting some 12 years later in 1959 when he appeared in Romano Scarpa&#x27;s &quot;Topolino e la dimensione Delta&quot; (&quot;Mickey Mouse and the Delta Dimension&quot;). In this story, he discovered the means to travel to the Delta Dimension, which was effectively an infinite void of nothing, just space.

Setting his laboratory up in the Delta Dimension, Einmug pursued his work and discovered that atoms were living beings. He thus increased the size of one of them to that of a small boy and named him Atomo Bleep-Bleep (Italian: Atomino Bip-Bip).

Einmug himself has also appeared in numerous European Mickey Mouse comics. He is often shown as less secretive and paranoid than in his original appearance, though his discoveries are still coveted by the likes of Pete and the Phantom Blot.

Einmug reappeared in American comics in 1991 in the story &quot;A Snatch in Time!&quot; in which he had developed a time machine. It was written by Lamar Waldron and drawn by Rick Hoover and Gary Martin. More recently, Einmug has also appeared in American editions of &quot;The Delta Dimension&quot; and other European-made stories.

=== Detective Casey ===
Detective Casey (sometimes Inspector Casey) is Chief O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s head detective, first appearing in the Mickey Mouse daily comic in the 1938 sequence &quot;The Plumber&#x27;s Helper&quot;. The story was plotted and penciled by Floyd Gottfredson and written by Merrill De Maris. Casey disappeared from American comics in the 1950s, but was used frequently in Europe, especially in Italy, afterwards; from 2003, he returned as a frequent player in the American comics.

Despite his occupation, Casey is an impatient man of only average intelligence. Thus, while sometimes a successful detective, he is prone to bungling cases as well. Therefore, Chief O&#x27;Hara often recruits Mickey Mouse to help solve some of Casey&#x27;s cases, much to Casey&#x27;s general irritation.

=== Chief O&#x27;Hara ===
Chief Seamus O&#x27;Hara is the chief of police in the Mickey Mouse universe. He plays a supportive role in Mickey Mouse&#x27;s comic-book mysteries, often relying on Mickey&#x27;s help to solve crimes committed by criminals such as Pete, The Phantom Blot and others. Known fellow officers include his head detective, Detective Casey.

The character was conceived by Floyd Gottfredson and Merrill De Maris for Disney&#x27;s comic strips as a stereotypical Irish cop. He first appeared in the newspaper strips in May 1939, in the serial &quot;Mickey Mouse Outwits the Phantom Blot&quot;. He eventually became a recurring character in European comics stories. O&#x27;Hara also appeared on &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot; and &quot;House of Mouse&quot;, voiced by Corey Burton.

In the Brazilian version of the comics, he is known as &quot;Coronel Cintra&quot;, in the Danish versions as &quot;Politimester Striks&quot;, in the Finnish translation, he is known as &quot;Poliisimestari Simo Sisu&quot; (possibly named after the Finnish concept of sisu), in the French versions as &quot;Commissaire Finot&quot;, in the German versions as &quot;Kommissar Albert Hunter&quot; (Kommissar means commissioner in German), in the Italian version as &quot;Commissario Adamo Basettoni&quot; (with &quot;Basettoni&quot; referring to his prominent sideburns, &quot;basette&quot;), and in the Swedish versions as &quot;Kommissarie Konrad Karlsson&quot;.

In Italian stories, O&#x27;Hara has a wife called Petulia. Before her introduction, O&#x27;Hara frequently mentions his wife, with the first instance of this being &quot;The Gleam&quot; (1942).

=== The How-to Narrator ===

The How-to Narrator is a narrator that serves as a guide in short films starring Goofy where he shows how to do different types of activities. The How-to Narrator also has participation in the television series &quot;Goof Troop&quot; (1992), &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot; (1999-2000), &quot;House of Mouse&quot; (2001-2003), and &quot;How to Stay at Home&quot; (2021).

=== Pete Junior ===
Pete Junior, better known simply as P.J., is Pete&#x27;s son. He appears for first time in the short &quot;Bellboy Donald&quot;, as a naughty little kid. Later, he appears in the TV series &quot;Goof Troop&quot;, this time as a kind pre-teen, and being Max Goof&#x27;s best friend. After that he appeared in the film &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot;, also in the role of Max&#x27;s best friend, and its sequel &quot;An Extremely Goofy Movie&quot;, where he, Max, and their friend Bobby go to college. He also makes a cameo in the &quot;DuckTales&quot; reboot episode, &quot;Quack Pack&quot;, where he is seen in a photo from Goofy&#x27;s wallet.

=== José Carioca ===

José &quot;Zé&quot; Carioca is a green, Brazilian parrot who first appears in the Disney film &quot;Saludos Amigos&quot; (1942) alongside Donald Duck. He returned in the 1944 film &quot;The Three Caballeros&quot; along with Donald and a Mexican rooster named Panchito Pistoles. José is from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (thus the name &quot;Carioca&quot;, which is a term used for a person born in Rio de Janeiro). Zé Carioca comic books are still regularly published in Brazil to this day.

=== Panchito Pistoles ===

Panchito Pistoles is a red, Mexican rooster who was created as the third titular caballero (along with Donald Duck and José Carioca) for the 1944 film &quot;The Three Caballeros&quot;. Later he appeared in several Disney comics, including a year-long run in the &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; Sunday comic strip (1944–1945), as well as Don Rosa&#x27;s comic book stories &quot;The Three Caballeros Ride Again&quot; (2000) and &quot;The Magnificent Seven (Minus 4) Caballeros&quot; (2005).

=== Aracuan Bird ===

The Aracuan Bird, also called the Clown of the Jungle, first appeared in the feature film &quot;The Three Caballeros&quot; (1944). The film&#x27;s narrator introduces the Aracuan as &quot;one of the most eccentric birds you have ever seen&quot;.

=== Eega Beeva ===
Eega Beeva, also known by his proper name &quot;Pittisborum Psercy Pystachi Pseter Psersimmon Plummer-Push&quot;, is a human from the future, although some translations refer to him as an alien. He was created by Floyd Gottfredson (art) and Bill Walsh (plot) and first appeared on September 26, 1947, in the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; comic strip storyline &quot;The Man of Tomorrow&quot;. The complete original run of Eega Beeva stories has been anthologised in &quot;The Floyd Gottfredson Library&quot; volumes 9 &quot;Rise of the Rhyming Man&quot; and 10 &quot;Planet of Faceless Foes&quot;, published by Fantagraphics Books in 2016. The story arcs are given the titles &quot;The Man of Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Mickey Makes a Killing&quot;, &quot;Pflip the Thnuckle-booh&quot;, &quot;The Santa Claus Bandit&quot;, &quot;The Kumquat Question&quot;, &quot;The Atombrella and the Rhyming Man&quot;, &quot;An Education for Eega&quot;, &quot;Pflip&#x27;s Strange Power&quot;, &quot;Planet of the Aints&quot; (alternate title &quot;Be-junior and the Aints&quot;), &quot;Itching Gulch&quot;, &quot;The Syndicate of Crime&quot;, and &quot;The Moook Treasure&quot;. Eega&#x27;s final appearance is a three day bridge between story arcs; for convenience, the anthology prints this event as the start of the story arc &quot;Mousepotamia&quot;, in which Mickey is abducted to a foreign land, bereft of all his traditional companions.

In Eega&#x27;s debut story, Mickey Mouse and Goofy seek shelter from a thunderstorm and get lost in a cave. There, Mickey suddenly encounters an unusual humanoid who only says &quot;Eega&quot; at first. When Mickey and Goofy find the cave&#x27;s exit, Mickey invites the being to stay at his house, and the being identifies himself as &quot;Pittisborum Psercy Pystachi Pseter Psersimmon Plummer-Push&quot;. Finding this name too cumbersome, Mickey gives him the name &quot;Eega Beeva&quot; (a corruption of the idiom &quot;&quot;). At first, Goofy refuses to believe in the existence of Eega Beeva and ignores his presence. In a series of events, two scientists conclude that Eega Beeva is a human from 500 years in the future. At the end of the storyline, Eega saves Goofy from a skiing accident, causing them to become friends.

In the next comic strip storyline starring Eega Beeva, &quot;Mickey Makes a Killing&quot;, his pet Pflip the Thnuckle Booh is introduced. Eega continues being Mickey&#x27;s sidekick in the American comic strips until July 1950.

Eega Beeva is depicted as a humanoid with a wide head, mitten-like hands and a scrawny body. In &quot;The Man of Tomorrow&quot;, the name is given to him by Mickey, since Eega Beeva originally only said &quot;Eega.&quot; In the original conception of the character, Eega Beeva&#x27;s look was attributed to him being a highly evolved human from 500 years in the future, namely from the year 2447. All humans would have Eega-like proportions. He wears short, black trousers which have pockets of seemingly infinite size and can hold a multitude of objects sometimes much bigger than Eega Beeva himself (similar to Doctor Who&#x27;s TARDIS), often helping Mickey Mouse and Eega in difficult situations. A running joke in the comic is that when Eega Beeva is searching for something in his pockets, he has to take multiple attempts, as he first finds completely unrelated objects.

Another trademark attribute of the character is his &quot;alien&quot; speech, adding a &quot;p&quot; at the beginning of most words. From his first appearance, he has been shown to prefer sleeping on top of narrow poles, such as on top of Mickey Mouse&#x27;s bedpost. He eats pickled kumquats for food (changed to mothballs in Italian translations and stories produced in Italy) and is severely allergic to cash; these traits have sometimes been used as plot devices.

While a genius scientist by today&#x27;s standards, Eega Beeva is also maladjusted to the contemporary world. Depending on the stories and writers, his behaviour ranges from naïve and eccentric (including being &quot;primitive&quot; and attacking radios as demons) to serious and rational (being able to recite complex scientific equations which leave Earth&#x27;s best scientists baffled). Other members of Eega&#x27;s species are glimpsed briefly. In his wallet he keeps a photograph of his fiancée (who is beautiful even by 20th century standards), and his farewell moments show additional snapshots of his father, mother, grandfather, and sister. He also has a brother, whose picture is obscured in the scene depicting the others.

Eega Beeva was a central character in the American newspaper Disney comic strips, for nearly three years. He was Mickey Mouse&#x27;s main sidekick during this period, effectively replacing Goofy, whose appearances became few and far between. This lasted until July 1950, when Eega abruptly returned to his home in the future. Walsh&#x27;s stories are often wildly inconsistent in themselves as to what Eega Beeva&#x27;s attributes and back story are, as pointed out in the editorial columns in &quot;The Floyd Gottfredson Library&quot;. During his first story &quot;The Man of Tomorrow&quot;, Goofy declares that Eega is only a hallucinatory apparition because he casts no shadow, when in fact an earlier panel in the story showed Eega&#x27;s shadow. In Eega&#x27;s farewell appearance, he refers to his family as &quot;the Beeva family&quot;. As he departs into the cave where Mickey first met him, he implies that his family live in there are eagerly awaiting his homecoming. This contradicts his first story, where &quot;Beeva&quot; is a name Mickey made up for him, and Eega&#x27;s family were not yet to be born for another 400 or more years.

While Eega Beeva was still being featured in the American comic strips, he made his first appearance in a 1949 Italian comic story titled &quot;L&#x27;inferno di Topolino&quot; (lit. &quot;Mickey Mouse&#x27;s inferno,&quot; &quot;Topolino&quot; issue 7), in which Mickey plays Dante Alighieri in a theatre production of the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. The character was newly discovered and defined by Italian comics artist and writer Romano Scarpa with the comic &quot;Topolino e la nave del microcosmo&quot; (lit. &quot;Mickey Mouse and the ship of microcosm&quot;), published in &quot;Topolino&quot; 167 in July 1957; American translation published in BOOM&#x27;s &quot;Mickey Mouse Classics 1 - Mouse Tails&quot; (2010). (Eega had previously appeared in stories which Scarpa drew but did not write, including Guido Martina&#x27;s &quot;Topolino e il doppio segreto di Macchia Nera&quot; in &quot;Topolino&quot; 116-119, 1955 - Americanised in Gladstone&#x27;s &quot;Mickey and Donald&quot; 6-8 [1988] and Fantagraphics&#x27; hardcover album &quot;Mickey Mouse: The Phantom Blot&#x27;s Double Mystery&quot; [2018].) Rather than his whimsical attributes, the &quot;microcosm&quot; story focuses on the futuristic and fantastic aspects of Eega Beeva and his environment, as do later stories. In Germany some of those stories star Eega Beeva without Mickey. The character has since been used numerous times by European authors, mostly in Italy where more than half of all comics featuring him were produced. He is referred to as Eta Beta in Italian and Gamma in German.

Older Italian stories often portrayed him as an alien from outer space. More recently (post-2000), Italian writers have generally reverted to Gottfredson&#x27;s original conception of Eega as a future-man, though his precise year of origin is rarely mentioned. More recent Eega comics produced by Egmont, on the other hand, often refer to his hometown as being the Mouseton of 2447, just as in Gottfredson&#x27;s original stories.

=== Ellsworth ===
Ellsworth started as Goofy&#x27;s pet mynah bird, but in later stories, he became an independent anthropomorphic animal. His full name is Ellsworth Bheezer (occasionally misspelled Bhezer—&quot;beezer&quot; is old English slang for a big nose or beak). He was created by Bill Walsh (plot) and Manuel Gonzales (art) for the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; Sunday pages, where he made his first appearance on October 30, 1949. Ellsworth remained for ten years a major character in the Sunday pages, sometimes stealing the spotlight from Mickey. In 1956 he started appearing in the daily pages, when these became gag-focused as well. He has also been used in longer comics stories, especially the ones produced in Italy, France and Brazil. In France, he has been the protagonist of his own series, published from 1985 to 2009 in &quot;Le Journal de Mickey&quot;.

Ellsworth usually wears a red-orange shirt and a green cap or beret. Reflecting a trait of mynah birds who can imitate human speech, he is extremely vain and self-centered, which was originally the spotlight and center of jokes in his stories. On the other hand, Ellsworth is also a bonafide genius with awesome tech and scientific knowledge—the &quot;Y&quot; on his shirt in earlier stories stands for &quot;Yarvard&quot; (a parody of Harvard), his alma mater.

Despite being more or less entirely humanized in more recent stories, Ellsworth retains his ability to fly, a unique trait among the central Disney funny animal cast.

In manner, Ellsworth is often sarcastic and condescending, typically addressing others with statements like &quot;Let&#x27;s not [do X], shall we?&quot; He is also quick to call others by insulting nicknames. But when push comes to shove, he is genuinely fond of and defensive of his pals Goofy and Mickey.

=== Atomo Bleep-Bleep ===
Atomo Bleep-Bleep (, ) is a &quot;humanized atom&quot; created by Doctor Einmug, who used a gigantic meson accelerator to enlarge atoms to the size of a human child. The character was created by Romano Scarpa in the 1959 story &quot;Topolino e la dimensione Delta&quot; (&quot;Mickey Mouse in the Delta Dimension&quot;), published in &quot;Topolino&quot; No. 206. Bleep-Bleep is a good-natured, highly intelligent, hard-working blue creature with electrons constantly spinning around his large bald head. He was created at the same time as his &quot;brother&quot;, a red atom named Bloop-Bloop, who was bad-tempered and lazy. Bleep-Bleep can spit mesons to alter or manipulate the attributes of physical objects and uses this ability to accomplish various feats such as turning metal into chocolate or estimating with absolute precision when an object was created. In their first adventure together, Atomo and Mickey manage to foil Pete, who has enlisted Bloop-Bloop as his accomplice. Scarpa wrote and drew a further eight stories with Atomo that appeared in &quot;Topolino&quot; from 1959 to 1965. The character has been revived occasionally by other Italian authors. In his appearance as well as his role in the stories, Atomo is very similar to Gottfredson&#x27;s Eega Beeva, a short, friendly science-fiction character with unpredictable powers that drive the plot. In English-language translations, Atomo Bleep-Bleep speaks with a German accent identical to Einmug&#x27;s, insofar as Einmug was presented as Atomo&#x27;s language teacher.

=== Glory-Bee ===
Glory-Bee was Goofy&#x27;s girlfriend who first appeared in a &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; daily strip on June 19, 1969. She was first created by Bill Walsh, and appeared in some &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; dailies by Floyd Gottfredson, and others written by Del Connell (drawn by Manuel Gonzales). Her predecessor appeared perhaps as early as 1946, in the form of Minnie Mouse&#x27;s Aunt Marissa (from a multi-part story by Floyd Gottfredson printed in the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; dailies June 17–29, 1946, and reprinted twice in WDC&amp;S No. 95 and No. 575, and later seen in a cameo one-page gag love story by Bill Walsh and Manuel Gonzales which also featured Mickey Mouse and Montmorency Rodent (Mortimer Mouse) (April 21, 1946) that has been dubbed &quot;Spring, Love, Monty&quot;).

Glory-Bee is a slender, pretty, blonde, and young dognose lady who, while quite good-natured and likable, tends to be somewhat of an &quot;airhead&quot; (a stereotype of the &quot;dumb blonde&quot;), which may explain why she was dropped from Goofy&#x27;s storyline altogether (though a better possibility is that Goofy will always be the consummate bachelor). While it might be difficult to imagine she had a very strong crush on Goofy, he hardly seemed to notice. Occasionally, however, he did try to impress her, even to the point of trying to reveal his Super Goof identity to her, to no avail. At one point Glory-Bee and Clarabelle Cow were even vying for Goofy&#x27;s attention, but both failed to achieve their objective (WDS #8). Perhaps it was during this time that Clarabelle dropped her strange attraction to Goofy, and returned to her former paramour and fiancé, Horace Horsecollar.

Glory-Bee has disappeared from comics in the USA and has seldom appeared in foreign comics.

=== The Sleuth ===
The Sleuth, Sureluck Sleuth in full, is an anthropomorphic canine. He is an English private eye operating in 19th century London and employing Mickey Mouse as an assistant. The character was created by Carl Fallberg (plot) and Al Hubbard (art) for the Disney Studio Program and intended solely for foreign publication. The first story in the series is &quot;&quot;Mickey and the Sleuth: The Case of the Wax Dummy&quot;. Unusually for material created for the program, this story appeared domestically in the Procter &amp; Gamble &quot;Disney Magazine&quot; giveaway and then was published by Gold Key in &quot;Walt Disney Showcase&quot;&quot; n°38 (1977). &quot;Mickey and the Sleuth&quot; stories were produced up until the late 1980s. Given their historical setting, these stories stand apart from other Mickey Mouse continuities. It is never explained if the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; working with the Sleuth is an ancestor of the present-day Mickey or if those stories are included in a totally different continuity. Adding to the muddle are the frequent humorous anachronisms which complicate the purportedly Victorian setting, and arguably place the stories in the genre of steampunk. Apart from Mickey, no other prominent Disney characters are featured in the stories. The Sleuth&#x27;s recurring antagonists are Professor Nefarious and his three bumbling henchmen.

The Sleuth is a good-natured gentleman; wearing a deerstalker hat, smoking a pipe and using a magnifying glass, he is an obvious parody of Sherlock Holmes, Mickey basically playing the part of Dr. Watson. Like his literary counterpart, he also plays the violin (albeit horribly). Unlike Sherlock Holmes, he is totally hopeless as a detective, sometimes unable to figure out crimes committed right in front of his eyes. Nevertheless, he always manages to solve his cases – hence ensuring a reputation as a great investigator – either by sheer luck, or thanks to his foes&#x27; fecklessness or simply because Mickey Mouse does all the actual detective work for him. Apart from Mickey, no one seems to be aware of the Sleuth&#x27;s utter incompetence.

The characters of The Sleuth and Professor Nefarious, complete with the University of Criminal Sciences and the henchman Fliplip, were portrayed in an extended sketch in an episode of &quot;The New Mickey Mouse Club&quot; in 1978. Two Mouseketeer cast members – Lisa Whelchel as the Sleuth&#x27;s niece Lisa, and Scott Craig as Fliplip – performed alongside the two lead rivals, using puppetry and ventriloquism skills. The setting of the story was England, near the White Cliffs of Dover.

=== Ellroy ===
Ellroy (original Italian name &quot;Bruto Gancetto&quot;) is an anthropomorphic mynah bird and Ellsworth&#x27;s adoptive son. He was created by Romano Scarpa in the story &quot;Topolino e il rampollo di Gancio&quot; (&quot;Topolino&quot; n°1048, 1975). After adopting Ellroy, Ellsworth entrusted him to Mickey Mouse. Ellroy went on to be Mickey Mouse&#x27;s sidekick in numerous Italian comics stories by Scarpa and other authors. Like Ellsworth, Ellroy can fly by using his arms like wings. Ellsworth and Ellroy look very much alike – Ellroy being somewhat smaller – and have appeared together in relatively few stories : this has caused confusion between the two characters among readers and translators. Ellroy first appeared in American comic books in 2016.

=== Zapotec and Marlin ===
Professor Zachary Zapotec and Dr. Spike Marlin are two Italian dogface characters created by Massimo De Vita. They are scientists from the Mouseton science museum. They are the inventors of a time machine which sends Mickey and Goofy on adventures in the past. Zapotec first appeared in &quot;Topolino e l&#x27;enigma di Mu&quot; in 1979 and Marlin first appeared in &quot;Topolino e il segreto della Gioconda&quot; in 1985. They also frequently argue but always forgive each other by the end. So far, they have only appeared in a handful of stories in the US.

=== Zenobia ===
Zenobia is a character created by Romano Scarpa, first appearing in the 1983 story &quot;The African Queen&quot;, being the ruler of an African state, and leaving the throne to follow Goofy to the United States after having fallen in love with him. Scarpa&#x27;s intention was to create a new girlfriend for Goofy, capable of bringing out the best in him.

In her stories with Goofy, he seems &quot;more serious&quot; and less inclined to follow Mickey on his adventures. Perhaps this was the reason that would push Scarpa to abandon Zenobia&#x27;s participation in the stories: in the story &quot;Ciao Minnotchka&quot; (1993), after a trip to France with Mickey&#x27;s gang, Zenobia announces that she will stay in Paris to help the ex-king of Selvanja, Ilja Topòvich, to run a hotel, as there is an attraction between the former rulers, and Goofy can&#x27;t help but agree. But Zenobia has never forgotten Goofy, as shown in &quot;Miseria e nobiltà&quot; (1993) by Lello Arena, Francesco Artibani and Giorgio Cavazzano; after having performed at the theater, Goofy finds in her dressing room a bouquet of flowers with the dedication: &quot;You are always the best. Zenobia.&quot;

Subsequently, Zenobia reappeared in various stories since 2013.

=== Doc Static ===
Doc Static is an overweight, clean-shaven inventor with a lab coat, wavy hair and glasses who appears in Egmont comic stories. He serves the same role in Mickey stories that Gyro Gearloose or Ludwig Von Drake have for Donald and Scrooge.

Doc Static first appeared in &quot;Plastic Mickey!&quot; in 1995.

=== Brick Boulder ===
Brick Boulder (original Italian name &quot;Rock Sassi&quot;, which is a pleonasm as &quot;sassi&quot; means &quot;rocks&quot;) is a plainclothes police officer who usually works together with Detective Casey. He first appeared in the story &quot;La lunga notte del commissario Manetta&quot; (English title: Casey&#x27;s Longest Night) in 1997, written by Tito Faraci and drawn by Giorgio Cavazzano .

Like Casey, Brick Boulder is a bumbling and incompetent policeman. Curiously though, his intelligence seems to vary, even between stories by the same writer. He is physically more robust than the overweight Casey and likes to dress flashily, often wearing cowboy boots, a stetson and a bolo tie. He has been said to be a parody of Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger, the latter aspect being particularly obvious in his first appearance, but later toned down.

Brick Boulder is from Texas, United States. In one story, it was revealed that his entire family consists of criminals. Despite this, Brick Boulder is law-abiding and has wanted to be a policeman since his early childhood, much to the disappointment of his family. Another quirk is that he is afraid of alligators, as shown in the story &quot;Topolino e lo strano caso di Jack Due di Cuori&quot;.

=== Duffy the Disney Bear ===

Duffy is a teddy bear available at Disney Parks. He was given a backstory in which Minnie Mouse sewed him for Mickey as he was leaving for a voyage at sea.

=== Eurasia Toft ===
Eurasia Toft (&quot;Eurasia Tost&quot; in Italian) is an adventurer and archaeologist, and a friend of Mickey and Goofy. Her first appearance happened in the 2003 story &quot;The Lost Explorers&#x27; Trail&quot;, written by Casty (who also created the character) and drawn by Giorgio Cavazzano. She is a strong-willed character and can react very impulsively. Fans have likened her to Arizona Goof, though she has fewer personality quirks. Her name and character parody both Indiana Jones as well as Lara Croft (her Greek name is &quot;Clara Loft&quot;). Ever since the end of &quot;Shadow of the Colossus&quot;, she has been obsessed with Atlantis; in her quest for the lost continent, she has repeatedly confronted a secret society called &quot;Horde of the Violet Hare&quot; (also created by Casty), who want to use Atlantean technology for their own goals.

=== Cuckoo-Loca ===
Cuckoo-Loca is a small yellow cuckoo from a cuckoo clock with a pink bow on her head and a tail in the shape of a clock key that serves her to fly by spinning it, introduced in the television series &quot;Minnie&#x27;s Bow-Toons&quot; (2011) working in Minnie&#x27;s boutique with her and Daisy.

After that, she became a frequent character in the series and productions derived from it, appearing in the series &quot;Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures&quot; (2017) as one of the main characters in the stories centered on Minnie and Daisy, helping them with their orders. She subsequently appeared as a recurring character in the series &quot;Mickey Mouse Funhouse&quot; (2021). In 2021 she appeared in the Halloween TV special &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Tale of Two Witches&quot;, and in the same year in the Christmas special &quot;Mickey and Minnie Wish Upon a Christmas&quot;.

In the stop motion TV special &quot;Mickey Saves Christmas&quot; (2022), Cuckoo-Loca makes a cameo appearance, with a figurine of her emerging from the cuckoo clock in Santa&#x27;s workshop.

Being &quot;Loca&quot; the Spanish word for &quot;Crazy&quot;, her name is probably a reference to when people compare someone who is considered crazy to a cuckoo.

== Non-anthropomorphic supporting characters ==

===Chip &#x27;n&#x27; Dale===

Chip &#x27;n&#x27; Dale are two chipmunks who are often trouble-makers for Pluto and Donald. However, the chipmunks are often provoked, especially by Donald.

=== Beppo the Gorilla ===
Beppo is a gorilla who first appeared in the short film &quot;The Gorilla Mystery&quot; (1930), where he escapes from the zoo and kidnaps Minnie, finally getting Mickey to rescue her and returning Beppo to the zoo. He reappeared in the short film &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Mechanical Man&quot; (1933) as &quot;The Kongo Killer&quot;, where he faces Champ, the mechanical man created by Mickey, in a boxing championship. His third and final appearance in a short film was in &quot;The Pet Store&quot; (1933), as a gorilla in a pet store, where he kidnaps Minnie in King Kong style.

Beppo appears in the video game &quot;Epic Mickey&quot; (2010) fighting in a boxing ring against Champ just like in &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Mechanical Man&quot;. In the video game &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot; (2019), Beppo appears as an enemy in the &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Mechanical Man&quot; minigame, based on in the short film of the same name.

===Tanglefoot===
Tanglefoot is Mickey&#x27;s broken-down but loyal horse, introduced in a 1933 comic strip storyline, &quot;Mickey Mouse and His Horse Tanglefoot&quot;. The horse character returned in two more stories and was so popular at the time that in 1934 Western Publishing released six Big Little Books related to Tanglefoot.

=== Fifi the Peke ===
Fifi the Peke is Minnie&#x27;s &quot;prize pooch&quot; and Pluto&#x27;s girlfriend. In one cartoon (&quot;Pluto&#x27;s Quin-puplets&quot;) Pluto and Fifi even had five puppies together. One of them was eventually named Pluto Junior. Later on, Fifi was replaced as Pluto&#x27;s girlfriend by Dinah the Dachshund. Fifi disappeared from animation but she appeared in the line of merchandise called &quot;Minnie &#x27;n Me&quot; as Minnie&#x27;s dog. She eventually returned to animation in the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; episode &quot;You, Me and Fifi&quot;, and later appeared in &quot;Chip &#x27;n&#x27; Dale: Park Life&quot;.

=== Bobo the Elephant ===
Bobo is a baby elephant who has appeared as a pet of Mickey Mouse in at least two stories. He was first featured in a self-titled storyline in the Mickey Mousenewspaper comic strip. In the story, Mickey mistakenly purchases Bobo at an auction. Eli Squinch, also making his first appearance in that story, convinces Mickey that he is Bobo&#x27;s rightful owner. However, Eli actually intends to use Bobo to run his sawmill to save on electricity, using a treadmill which had already killed two horses. Mickey and Horace Horsecollar stall Eli&#x27;s repossession of Bobo until the baby pachyderm discovers his mother is in a visiting circus. Bobo runs away and is reunited with his mother.

Bobo&#x27;s only animated appearance was in 1936&#x27;s &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Elephant&quot;. He is given to Mickey by the Rajah of Gahboon. Disney had planned to make Bobo into a recurring character, but nothing ever came of the idea. Storyboard sketches of a planned cartoon featuring Bobo, titled Spring Cleaning, were printed in the book Mickey Mouse: The Floyd Gottfredson Library – Volume 3: Showdown at Inferno Gulch. Bobo returned in the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; episode &quot;Safari, So Good&quot;.

===Figaro===
Figaro is Minnie&#x27;s pet cat who first appeared in Disney&#x27;s animated film &quot;Pinocchio&quot;. He sometimes gets along with Pluto.

=== Butch the Bulldog ===

Butch the Bulldog is Pluto&#x27;s nemesis. He first appeared in the film &quot;Bone Trouble&quot; (1940), where Pluto tried to steal his bone. Ever since then, Butch has been antagonizing Pluto. Sometimes, Butch competes with Pluto for the affections of Dinah the Dachshund. At one point, Butch even antagonized Figaro the Kitten (&quot;Figaro and Frankie&quot;, 1947).

The rest of his filmography includes &quot;T-Bone for Two&quot; (1942), &quot;Canine Casanova&quot; (1945), &quot;Pluto&#x27;s Kid Brother&quot; (1946), &quot;The Purloined Pup&quot; (1946), &quot;Pluto&#x27;s Housewarming&quot; (1947), &quot;Pluto&#x27;s Purchase&quot; (1948), &quot;Pluto&#x27;s Sweater&quot; (1949), &quot;Pluto&#x27;s Heart Throb&quot; (1950), and &quot;Wonder Dog&quot; (1950). His owner never appeared in the short films. Butch&#x27;s vocal effects in these shorts are provided by Jimmy MacDonald.

Butch appears in the &quot;Robocat&quot; episode of &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot; voiced by Jim Cummings. This version can speak in a gangster accent and assists the Rescue Rangers when dealing with Fat Cat&#x27;s gang.

Butch is also a recurring character in the television series &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot; and &quot;House of Mouse&quot; with his vocal effects provided by Frank Welker. He appears as a rival to Pluto in the cartoons starring him.

In &quot;Mickey Mouse Clubhouse&quot; and &quot;Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures&quot;, Pete is shown as Butch&#x27;s owner and is depicted with brown fur. Butch&#x27;s vocal effects are also provided by Frank Welker here.

Butch appears in &quot;Chip &#x27;n&#x27; Dale: Park Life&quot; with his vocal effects provided by David Gasman.

=== Salty the Seal ===
Salty the Seal is a seal who shows up in typical seal locations (the circus, the beach, the zoo, the Arctic) and annoys Pluto into chasing him, causing Pluto to get into dangerous predicaments. Salty typically saves him, leading Salty and Pluto to become best friends—until Salty&#x27;s &quot;next&quot; appearance, when the cycle begins again. Salty&#x27;s debut was in &quot;Pluto&#x27;s Playmate&quot; (1942), later returning in &quot;Rescue Dog&quot; (1947) and the particularly famous &quot;Mickey and the Seal&quot; (1948). Salty also has appearances in the television series &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot;, &quot;House of Mouse&quot; and &quot;Mickey Mouse Clubhouse&quot;.

=== Dinah the Dachshund ===
Dinah the Dachshund appears as Pluto&#x27;s girlfriend although she sometimes dates Butch the Bulldog as well. She first appears in &quot;The Sleepwalker&quot;. In &quot;Canine Casanova&quot;, when she winds up in the dog pound, Pluto saves the day, becomes Dinah&#x27;s hero and the two start dating. In other cartoons such as &quot;In Dutch&quot;, &quot;Pluto&#x27;s Heart Throb&quot; and &quot;Wonder Dog&quot;, the two engage in further romance, often with Butch the Bulldog as Pluto&#x27;s romantic rival.

Dinah has more recently appeared in several cartoon shorts in the anthology series &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot; and &quot;House of Mouse&quot;, where &quot;Pluto&#x27;s Arrow Error&quot; shows Dinah as Butch&#x27;s girlfriend first with no serious interest in Pluto.

=== Dolores the Elephant ===
Dolores the Elephant is an Asian elephant belonging to Goofy. She debuted in the short film &quot;Tiger Trouble&quot; (1945), serving as a mount to Goofy during a tiger hunt. She appeared a second time in &quot;The Big Wash&quot; (1948), as a circus elephant that Goofy was trying to give a bath. Her third and last appearance in a short film was in &quot;Working for Peanuts&quot; (1953), as an elephant in a zoo from whom Chip and Dale try to steal her peanuts, and Donald, who was her caretaker, tried to stop the chipmunks.

Dolores was named after Walt Disney&#x27;s secretary, Dolores Voght.

=== Bent-Tail the Coyote ===
Bent-Tail the Coyote is a desert coyote and an opponent against Pluto. He always tries to get some food which Pluto is guarding (mostly livestock), but fails every time. He made his first appearance in &quot;The Legend of Coyote Rock&quot; trying to get at a flock of sheep. From the second short &quot;Sheep Dog&quot; onward he has a son who works with him. His last two starring shorts are &quot;Pests of the West&quot; and &quot;Camp Dog&quot;. An older version of Bent-Tail later appeared in the &quot;Walt Disney presents&quot; episode &quot;The Coyote&#x27;s Lament&quot;, where he teaches his grandson (who is the offspring of Bent-Tail&#x27;s son) how humans and dogs have put a coyote&#x27;s life in misery. Bent-Tail and his son also appeared in several Disney comics.

=== Pflip ===
Pflip is Eega Beeva&#x27;s pet &quot;thnuckle-booh&quot;, a mixture of dog, cat, hippopotamus, unicorn, llama, rabbit, and possibly other animals as well. He has a color warning system that turns red to warn Eega of certain danger.

=== Louie the Mountain Lion ===
Louie the Mountain Lion is a mountain lion who appears as an occasional antagonist of Goofy and Donald. He is usually depicted in Donald Duck and Goofy shorts, in which he often chases after the main characters in an attempt to eat them. Unlike most Disney cartoon characters, Louie does not speak, but instead makes grunting or growling sounds representing satisfaction, disapproval, or anxiety. He is also shown to care deeply about food and is rather intelligent when it comes to planning schemes to obtain things he wants, though his attempts to execute his plans often end in comical failures.

Louie&#x27;s first appearance was in &quot;Lion Around&quot; where he attempts to eat Donald. In &quot;Hook, Lion and Sinker&quot;, he is revealed to have a son. He later rivals Goofy in &quot;Lion Down&quot; and &quot;Father&#x27;s Lion&quot;. Louie again encounters Donald in &quot;Grand Canyonscope&quot; which reveals he is at least 90 years old (having been seen in the Grand Canyon during the US Civil War), in this short he acts as an antagonist towards both Donald and J. Audubon Woodlore.

He also appears as a recurring character in &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot; and &quot;House of Mouse&quot;.

His classification as a non-anthropomorphic character may be debated, as he speaks in some comics.

=== Milton the Cat ===
Milton the Cat is a red ginger Siamese cat and a rival of Pluto. He often competes with Pluto for food. He made his first appearance in the short &quot;Puss Cafe&quot; (1950) with his pal Richard. He next appears in the short &quot;Plutopia&quot; (1951) where he talks in Pluto&#x27;s dream, voiced by Jim Backus. He made a final appearance in the short &quot;Cold Turkey&quot; (1951) fighting with Pluto for a roast turkey but both of them ended up with nothing.

=== Clarice ===
Clarice is a chipmunk who appeared in the short film &quot;Two Chips and a Miss&quot; (1952), being the romantic interest of Chip and Dale, for whom they both compete for her attention, although she seems to love them both equally (at the end of the short film ending by giving both of them a kiss). She works as a singer in a night club.

Despite her only appearance in a short film, she became a very popular character, appearing in Disney Parks as a meet-and-greet character or in live shows, and appearing in the video games &quot;Disney Tsum Tsum&quot; (2014) and &quot;Disney Magical World 2&quot; (2015).

Clarice did not have an animated appearance again since &quot;Two Chips and a Miss&quot; until she appeared as a recurring character in the television series &quot;Chip &#x27;n&#x27; Dale: Park Life&quot; (2021-present), having a radical design change, being a tough chipmunk, wearing no clothes, and having for a hairstyle a crest with flowers shaved on the sides of the head. In the series she lives in the engine of a car that is on a tree. Her relationship with Chip and Dale is also simply friendship, although they admire her for her abilities, she being very constructive and being constantly fixing and repairing things.

==Characters from the Donald Duck universe==
Donald Duck was a frequent supporting character in Mickey Mouse cartoons and comics until the 1940s. Since then, characters from the Duck universe have been making occasional appearances in Mickey Mouse stories, among them the most common being:

;Donald Duck : Mickey&#x27;s temperamental, and often selfish friend who dresses as a sailor and speaks with a semi-unintelligible voice.

;Daisy Duck : Donald&#x27;s girlfriend, with an equally dangerous temper but a much more sophisticated mien. She is best friends with Minnie.

;Scrooge McDuck : Donald Duck&#x27;s wealthy uncle who is the richest duck in the world. He lives in the city of Duckburg and is of Scottish descent.

;Ludwig Von Drake : Donald Duck&#x27;s eccentric uncle who is a resident scientist, lecturer, and psychiatrist. He was introduced in 1961, as part of Walt Disney&#x27;s NBC television special.

;Huey, Dewey, and Louie : Mischief-makers to provoke Donald&#x27;s famous temper, later appearances showed them to be heroes in their own right and valuable assets to him and Scrooge on their adventures.

== Ajax name brand ==
Ajax, sometimes called the Ajax Corporation, is a name brand which makes several appearances in Mickey Mouse stories. An early example is in &quot;Lonesome Ghosts&quot; (1937) where Mickey, Donald and Goofy work for Ajax Ghost Exterminators. Other examples include Ajax Locksmiths, Ajax Door Fixers, Ajax Hairbow Wear Sale and Ajax Lost and Found. The name Ajax Corporation makes many appearances in the television series &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot; and &quot;House of Mouse&quot;. It is roughly equivalent to Warner Bros.&#x27; Acme brand. It bears no relationship to either the real-world Ajax company, a manufacturer of railroad car brake equipment, or the Ajax line of household cleaning products made and marketed by Colgate-Palmolive company, and pre-dates the introduction of Ajax cleanser by Colgate-Palmolive in 1947.

* In &quot;Frank Duck Brings &#x27;Em Back Alive&quot; (1946), Donald works for the Ajax Circus.
* In &quot;Donald&#x27;s Dream Voice&quot; (1948), Donald takes Ajax Voice Pills.
* &quot;The Little House&quot; (1952) features a company called Ajax Wrecking – Moving.
* In the &quot;Disneyland&quot; episode &quot;Duck for Hire&quot; (1957), Donald Duck visits the Ajax Employment Agency.

<text>The Palestinian Society for the Protection of Human Rights and the Environment () was &quot;dedicated to preserving human rights through legal advocacy&quot;. Also known as &quot;LAW&quot; (as in Law Society) (Arabic: ), this legal society is an affiliate to the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), The World Organization Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation of Human Rights Leagues (FIDH) and is a member of the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network.

==Views==

The group accuses Israel of apartheid and has recommended action against Israel at the World Conference Against Racism (WCAR) and prosecution in various international courts. They also defend victims of alleged human rights abuses in both Israeli and Palestinian courts. A nearly daily newsletter reported all right violations. A monthly magazine was published in English and Arabic.

The organization seeks to further the cause of Palestinians through the law courts rather than through violence, but some Israelis accuse the group of selectively ignoring alleged crimes committed by the Palestinian Authority and presenting a unilateral position of a propagandist nature.

==Funding==
The group was funded by European countries, Austria also provided a conscientious objector performing community service.

===Misuse of donations controversy===

A 2004 investigation by some donors found that financial aid was misappropriated by LAW&#x27;s Board. Soon after, many donors ceased funding. As a result, the organization had to lay off staff and to close down the office in Al-Ram. The LAW website has been inaccessible since 2005 which may indicate that the organization is no longer active.

<doc id="77562" wikidata="Q1051189" url="?curid=77562" title="Horace Horsecollar">
<text>Horace Horsecollar is a cartoon character created in 1929 at Walt Disney Animation Studios. Horace is a tall anthropomorphic black horse and is one of Mickey Mouse&#x27;s best friends. Characterized as a boastful show-off, Horace served as Mickey’s sidekick in Disney&#x27;s early black-and-white shorts.

Horace first appeared as Mickey&#x27;s plow horse in the 1929 cartoon &quot;The Plowboy&quot;. Later that same year, he appeared in &quot;The Jazz Fool&quot; and afterwards became a regular member of the Disney supporting cast along with Clarabelle Cow and Clara Cluck. Though typically a supporting character, he was given significant screen time in the cartoons &quot;The Beach Party&quot; (1931) and &quot;Camping Out&quot; (1934). In recent years, Horace has appeared in the television series &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot;, &quot;House of Mouse&quot;, &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot;, and &quot;Mickey and the Roadster Racers&quot;.

In the comics, Horace helped Mickey on his sleuthing expeditions before Goofy assumed that role.

==In animation==

Horace appeared frequently in cartoons from 1930 to 1932 and less frequently afterward, making his last appearance in the original run of Disney shorts in 1942. The name of Horace&#x27;s voice actor in the original shorts is unknown.

In his earliest incarnation, Horace was presented as Mickey Mouse&#x27;s four-legged plow horse. He could walk upright on his hind legs, at which time his forelegs became gloved hands; at other times, he got back down on all fours and reverted to form. Horace mostly played bit-parts in the over 30 films in which he appeared. Like Goofy in his early &quot;Dippy Dawg&quot; appearances, Horace&#x27;s body seemed to be formed of rubber tubing. His first appearance as a completely anthropomorphic horse was in &quot;The Shindig&quot; (1930), which also featured the first love scene between Horace and Clarabelle.

Horace&#x27;s biggest role was in &quot;Camping Out&quot; in 1934, where he was the star of the cartoon.

After departing the Disney studio in 1930, Ub Iwerks created a Horace-like character, the mule Orace, for his own studio; the name simply dropped the &#x27;H&#x27; from Horace.

As with many other Disney characters, he was later given small cameos in &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; (1983) and &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (1988). He had a bigger role as the Prince&#x27;s (Mickey&#x27;s royal double) stone-faced tutor in &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot; (1990).

In the television series &quot;House of Mouse&quot;, Horace has a recurring role as the club&#x27;s technician, playing cartoons for the audiences and generally running the machinery.

Since 1990, Horace has been voiced by Bill Farmer (who also voices Goofy and Pluto). Farmer established the character&#x27;s voice on the spot during recording for &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot;, when the director surprised him with the request. Asked for something &quot;aristocratic and snobbish&quot;, he says he mixed Ben Stein and Jim Backus.

In the 1990s, Horace was intended to star in a new TV series to be created for The Disney Afternoon, titled &quot;Maximum Horsepower&quot;, intended to explain his disappearance from cartoons after the 1930s ended. The concept would be that, in 1939, Horace had gotten tired of playing bit parts and, after learning that Mickey was going to star in a segment of &quot;Fantasia&quot;, was going to demand Walt to give him a starring role in that movie as well. On his way to Walt&#x27;s office, though, he gets abducted by aliens who bring him halfway across the galaxy because they are in desperate need of the hero that they believe Horace is, despite his dreams of returning to Earth and resuming his acting career. &quot;Maximum Horsepower&quot;, however, never came to be.

Horace has been a recurring character in the 2013 &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; television series and &quot;Mickey and the Roadster Racers&quot;.

==In comics==
Horace first appeared in the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; comic strip on April 3, 1930. Horace has seldom been more than a supporting character, though he has starred in numerous European comic book stories of his own. In these, he plays a much bigger role than elsewhere, accompanying Mickey on his adventures or acting as Clarabelle Cow&#x27;s paramour and fiance. Clarabelle and Horace were engaged in the comics according to some 1931 and 1932 continuities, but neither ever followed through.

Some modern European-made stories with Horace as a star character were published in the United States by Gemstone from 2003–2008, including:

*&quot;King of the Bungaloos&quot; (&quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; #635, 2003)
*&quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Horace&quot; (WDC&amp;S #641, 2004)
*&quot;Horace&#x27;s Secret Helper&quot; (&quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; #266, 2004)
*&quot;Horace&#x27;s Travails&quot; (MM #268, 2004)
*&quot;Driving Clarabelle Buggy&quot; (WDC&amp;S #651, 2004)
*&quot;All Aboard the Blunder Bus&quot; (WDC&amp;S #652, 2005)
*&quot;Blockheads&quot; (WDC&amp;S #656, 2005)
*&quot;High Horace&quot; (WDC&amp;S #692, 2008)
*&quot;&#x27;Tis Better to Give Than to Deceive&quot; (&quot;Christmas Parade&quot; #5, 2008)

Though produced in Denmark, these Horace stories were written by Americans: Stefan Petrucha, Sarah Kinney, and Don Markstein. Horace is a very common co-star in modern Mickey comics by these writers.

==In video games==
Horace appeared as the DJ of the reggae song &quot;Taiyō no Rakuen&quot; in the 2000 Japanese Nintendo 64 game &quot;Dance Dance Revolution Disney Dancing Museum&quot;. Characters were depicted in ways intended to match the style of the songs they DJed - as part of this, Horace was shown in a dreadlocked wig and &quot;Caribbean&quot; clothes.

Horace made a cameo appearance in the Timeless River world of &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; with many other characters like Clarabelle Cow and Clara Cluck as one of the world&#x27;s citizens. He also makes an appearance as a resident of Disney Town in &quot;Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep&quot;. He also appeared in &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Ultimate Challenge&quot; and &quot;Land of Illusion&quot;.

Horace is also a playable character in &quot;Disney TH!NK Fast&quot;.

Horace Horsecollar is a major character in &quot;Epic Mickey&quot; and &quot;Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two&quot;, having become a private investigator in Wasteland after arriving down there. He gives Mickey a number of quests in each game, some of which involve advancing his relationship with Clarabelle.

In 2016, Horace made an appearance along with Clarabelle Cow in &quot;Disney Crossy Road&quot; as an unlockable playable character under the Mickey and Friends theme.

==In Disney theme parks==
From September 2006 to September 2008, Horace Horsecollar and Clarabelle Cow appeared together for meet-and-greets in Town Square at the Magic Kingdom in Walt Disney World. Also, they were in the Main Street Family Fun Day Parade. Since Family Fun Day&#x27;s ending, the two have not been easy to see outside &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Boo-to-You Halloween Parade&quot;, &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Once Upon a Christmastime Parade&quot;, and the occasional special event.

Horace and Clarabelle come out for meet-and-greets and appear in parades and shows on a regular basis at Tokyo Disneyland as well.

Horace Horsecollar made his meet-and-greet debut at Disneyland in Anaheim with Clarabelle Cow as part of Character Fan Days Weekend.

<text>The United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) is a United States service academy in Air Force Academy Colorado, immediately north of Colorado Springs. It educates cadets for service in the officer corps of the United States Air Force and United States Space Force. It is the youngest of the five service academies, having graduated its first class in 1959, but is the third in seniority. Graduates of the academy&#x27;s four-year program receive a Bachelor of Science degree and are commissioned as second lieutenants in the U.S. Air Force or U.S. Space Force. The academy is also one of the largest tourist attractions in Colorado, attracting approximately a million visitors each year.

Admission is competitive, with nominations divided equally among Congressional districts. Recent incoming classes have had about 1,200 cadets; since 2012, around 20% of each incoming class does not graduate. During their tenure at the academy, cadets receive tuition, room and board, and a monthly stipend all paid for by the Air Force. On the first day of a cadet&#x27;s second class year, cadets commit to serving a number of years as a commissioned officer in the Air Force or Space Force. Non-graduates after that point are expected to fulfill their obligations in enlisted service or pay back full tuition. The commitment is normally five years of active duty and three years in the reserves, although it has varied depending on the graduate&#x27;s Air Force Specialty Code or Space Force Specialty Code.

==History==

===Establishment===
Prior to the academy&#x27;s establishment, air power advocates had been pushing for a separate Air Force Academy for decades. As early as 1918, Lieutenant Colonel A.J. Hanlon wrote, &quot;As the Military and Naval Academies are the backbone of the Army and Navy, so must the Aeronautical Academy be the backbone of the Air Service. No service can flourish without some such institution to inculcate into its embryonic officers love of country, proper conception of duty, and highest regard for honor.&quot; Other officials expressed similar sentiments. In 1919, Congressman Charles F. Curry introduced legislation providing for an Academy, but concerns about cost, curriculum and location led to its demise. In 1925, air power pioneer General Billy Mitchell testified on Capitol Hill that it was necessary &quot;to have an air academy to form a basis for the permanent backbone of your air service and to attend to the ... organizational part of it, very much the same way that West Point does for the Army, or that Annapolis does for the Navy.&quot; Mitchell&#x27;s arguments did not gain traction with legislators, and it was not until the late 1940s that the concept of the United States Air Force Academy began to take shape.

Support for an air academy got a boost with the National Security Act of 1947, which provided for the establishment of a separate air force within the United States military. As an initial measure, Secretary of the Air Force W. Stuart Symington negotiated an agreement where up to a quarter of West Point and Annapolis graduates could volunteer to receive their commissions in the newly established Air Force. This was only intended to be a short term fix, however, and disagreements between the services quickly led to the establishment of the Service Academy Board by Secretary of Defense James Forrestal. In January 1950, the Service Academy Board, headed by Dwight D. Eisenhower, then president of Columbia University, concluded that the needs of the Air Force could not be met by the two existing U.S. service academies and that an air force academy should be established.

Following the recommendation of the board, Congress passed legislation in 1954 to begin the construction of the Air Force Academy, and President Eisenhower signed it into law on 1 April of that year. The legislation established an advisory commission to determine the site of the new school. Among the panel members were Charles Lindbergh, General Carl Spaatz, and Lieutenant General Hubert R. Harmon, who later became the academy&#x27;s first superintendent. The original 582 sites considered were winnowed to three: Alton, Illinois (by purchasing Principia College); Lake Geneva, Wisconsin (near Big Foot Beach State Park); and the ultimate site at Colorado Springs, Colorado. The Secretary of the Air Force, Harold E. Talbott, announced the winning site on 24 June 1954. Meanwhile, Air Training Command (ATC) began developing a detailed curriculum for the academy program.

From 1954 to 1956, the newly created Colorado Land Acquisition Commission purchased parcels of land that would host the new academy. The first parcel purchased was the also the largest; it was the Cathedral Rock Ranch, owned by Lawrence B. Lehman of the famous Lehman investment family. The purchase price was $300,000, or about $65 per . 140 different parcels were eventually purchased to make up what is now a nearly- government property.

===Early years===
The early Air Force Academy leadership had the model of West Point and Annapolis in designing an appropriate curriculum, faculty, and campus. The academy&#x27;s permanent site had not yet been completed when the first class entered, so the 306 cadets from the Class of 1959 were sworn in at a temporary site at Lowry Air Force Base in Denver on 11 July 1955. While at Lowry, they were housed in renovated World War II barracks. There were no upper class cadets to train the new cadets, so the Air Force appointed a cadre of &quot;Air Training Officers&quot; (ATOs) to conduct training. The ATOs were junior officers, many of whom were graduates of West Point, Annapolis, VMI, and The Citadel. They acted as surrogate upper class cadets until the upper classes could be populated over the next several years. The academy&#x27;s dedication ceremony took place on that first day and was broadcast live on national television, with Walter Cronkite covering the event. Arnold W. Braswell was commander of the original four cadet squadrons at the academy 1955 to 1958.

In developing a distinctive uniform for cadets, the Air Force turned to Hollywood. Film director Cecil B. DeMille designed the cadet parade uniform still in use.

The Class of 1959 established many other important traditions that continue until the present. The first class adopted the Cadet Honor Code, and chose the falcon as the Academy&#x27;s mascot. On 29 August 1958, the wing of 1,145 cadets moved to the present site near Colorado Springs, and less than a year later the academy received accreditation. The first USAFA class graduated and was commissioned on 3 June 1959.

===Vietnam===
The Vietnam War was the first war in which academy graduates fought and died. As such, it had a profound effect on the development of the character of the academy. Due to the need for more pilots, academy enrollment grew significantly during this time. The size of the graduating classes went from 217 cadets in 1961 to 745 cadets in 1970. Academy facilities were likewise expanded, and training was modified to better meet the needs of the wartime Air Force. The Jacks Valley field training area was added, the Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) program was expanded, and light aircraft training started in 1968.

Many academy graduates of this era served with distinction in the Vietnam War. F-4 Phantom II pilot Steve Ritchie &#x27;64 and weapon systems officer Jeffrey Feinstein &#x27;68 each became aces by downing five enemy aircraft in combat. 141 graduates died in the conflict; 32 graduates became prisoners of war. Lance Sijan, &#x27;65, fell into both categories and became the first academy graduate to be awarded the Medal of Honor due to his heroism while evading capture and in captivity. Sijan Hall, one of the cadet dormitories, is named in his memory.

The effects of the anti-war movement were felt at the academy as well. Because the academy grounds are generally open to the public, the academy often became a site for protests by anti-war demonstrators.

===Women at the academy===
One of the most significant events in the history of the academy was the admission of women. On 7 October 1975, President Gerald R. Ford signed legislation permitting women to enter the United States service academies. On 28 June 1976, 157 women entered the Air Force Academy with the Class of 1980. Because there were no female upper class cadets, the Air Training Officer model used in the early years of the academy was revived, and fifteen young female officers were brought in to help with the integration process. The female cadets were initially segregated from the rest of the Cadet Wing but were fully integrated into their assigned squadrons after their first semester. On 28 May 1980, 97 of the original female cadets completed the program and graduated from the academy—just over 10% of the graduating class. Women have made up just over 20% of the most recent classes, with the class of 2016 having the highest proportion of any class, 25%.

Many of the women from those early classes went on to achieve success within the Cadet Wing and after graduation (see list of Academy graduates below). Despite these successes, integration issues were long apparent. Female cadets have had consistently higher dropout rates than men and have left the Air Force in higher numbers than men.
===Recent history===
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the academy graduated the Class of 2020 six weeks early. This was the first time that any USAFA class was ever commissioned early, and the first time for any military academy since the Vietnam War. This was also the first time that cadets were commissioned into the U.S. Space Force, with General Jay Raymond administering the oath of office to 86 graduates.

The US Space Force established its first unit at the academy when Detachment 1 of Space Delta 13 was activated in November 2021. It is expected that approximately 10% of graduates at the academy will enter the Space Force.

==Campus and facilities==
The campus of the academy covers on the east side of the Rampart Range of the Rocky Mountains, just north of Colorado Springs. Its elevation is normally given as above sea level, which is at the cadet area. The academy was designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM) and lead architect Walter Netsch. SOM partner John O. Merrill moved from Chicago to a Colorado Springs field office to oversee the construction and to act as a spokesman for the project.

The most controversial aspect of the SOM-designed Air Force Academy was its chapel. It was designed by SOM architect Walter Netsch, who at one point was prepared to abandon the design; but the accordion-like structure is acknowledged as an iconic symbol of the academy campus.

===The Cadet Area===
The buildings in the Cadet Area were designed in a distinct, modernist style, and make extensive use of aluminum on building exteriors, suggesting the outer skin of aircraft or spacecraft. On 1 April 2004, fifty years after Congress authorized the building of the academy, the Cadet Area at the academy was designated a National Historic Landmark.

The main buildings in the Cadet Area are set around a large, square pavilion known as the &quot;Terrazzo,&quot; and the most recognizable is the 17-spired Cadet Chapel. The subject of controversy when it was first built, it is now considered among the most prominent examples of modern American academic architecture. Other buildings on the Terrazzo include Vandenberg Hall and Sijan Hall, the two dormitories; Mitchell Hall, the cadet dining facility; and Fairchild Hall, the main academic building, which houses academic classrooms, laboratories, research facilities, faculty offices and the Robert F. McDermott Library.

The Aeronautics Research Center (also known as the &quot;Aero Lab&quot;) contains numerous aeronautical research facilities, including transonic, subsonic, low speed, and cascade wind tunnels; engine and rocket test cells; and simulators. Gregory Hall was built in 1997 as an annex to Fairchild Hall. It contains chemistry and biology classrooms and labs, medical and dental clinics, and civil engineering and astronautics laboratories. The Cadet Area also contains an observatory for astronomy research. A planetarium just outside the Cadet Area, originally built for navigation training, was closed in 2004 and reopened in 2019 for use in academics, community outreach, and cadet entertainment.

The cadet social center is Arnold Hall, located just outside the Cadet Area, which houses a 2700-seat theater, a ballroom, a number of lounges, and dining and recreation facilities for cadets and visitors. Harmon Hall is the primary administration building, which houses the offices of the Superintendent and the Superintendent&#x27;s staff.

The Cadet Area also contains extensive facilities for use by cadets participating in intercollegiate athletics, intramural athletics, physical education classes and other physical training. Set amid numerous outdoor athletic fields are the &quot;Cadet Gymnasium&quot; and the Cadet Fieldhouse. The Fieldhouse is the home to Clune Arena, the ice hockey rink and an indoor track, which doubles as an indoor practice facility for a number of sports. Falcon Stadium, located outside of the Cadet Area, is the football field and site of the graduation ceremonies.

===Commemorative displays===
Many displays around the Cadet Area commemorate heroes and air power pioneers, and serve as an inspiration to cadets. The &quot;War Memorial&quot;, a black marble wall located just under the flagpole on the Terrazzo, is etched with the names of academy graduates who have been killed in combat. The &quot;Honor Wall&quot;, overlooking the Terrazzo, is inscribed with the Cadet Honor Code: &quot;We will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor tolerate among us anyone who does.&quot; Just under the Cadet Chapel, the &quot;Class Wall&quot; bears the crests of each of the academy&#x27;s graduating classes. The crest of the current first (senior) class is displayed in the center position. Another display often used as a symbol of the academy, the &quot;Eagle and Fledglings Statue&quot; was given as a gift to the academy in 1958 by the personnel of Air Training Command. It contains the inscription by Austin Dusty Miller, &quot;Man&#x27;s flight through life is sustained by the power of his knowledge.&quot; Static air- and spacecraft displays on the academy grounds include an F-4, F-15, F-16 and F-105 on the Terrazzo; a B-52 by the North Gate; a T-38 and A-10 at the Academy Airfield; an F-100 by the preparatory school; a SV-5J lifting body next to the aeronautics laboratory; and a Minuteman III missile in front of the Fieldhouse. The Minuteman III was removed in August 2008 due to rusting and other internal damage.

The &quot;Core Values Ramp&quot; (formerly known as the &quot;Bring Me Men Ramp&quot;) leads down from the main Terrazzo level toward the parade field. On in-processing day, new cadets arrive at the base of the ramp and start their transition into military and academy life by ascending the ramp to the Terrazzo. From 1964 to 2004, the portal at the base of the ramp was inscribed with the words &quot;Bring me men ...&quot; taken from the poem, &quot;The Coming American,&quot; by Samuel Walter Foss. In a controversial move following the 2003 sexual assault scandal, the words &quot;Bring me men ...&quot; were taken down and replaced with the academy&#x27;s (later adopted as the Air Force&#x27;s) core values: &quot;Integrity first, service before self, and excellence in all we do.&quot;

===Air Academy High School===

With an enrollment of over 1300, Air Academy High School is the only high school in the United States built on a military academy. It ranks in the top ten in the state in academic standards. Part of School District 20 (D20), its marching band regularly places in the top ten in state championships. D20 also maintains an elementary school on the academy grounds.

===Other locations on campus===
Other locations on campus serve support roles for cadet training and other base functions. Doolittle Hall is the headquarters of the academy&#x27;s Association of Graduates and also serves as the initial reception point for new cadets arriving for Basic Cadet Training. It is named after General Jimmy Doolittle. The Goldwater Visitor Center, named after longtime proponent of the academy United States Senator Barry Goldwater, is the focal point for family, friends and tourists visiting the academy grounds. The Academy Airfield is used for training cadets in airmanship courses, including parachute training, soaring and powered flight. Interment at the Academy Cemetery is limited to academy cadets and graduates, certain senior officers, certain academy staff members, and certain other family members. Air power notables Carl Spaatz, Curtis E. LeMay and Robin Olds, are interred here.

The United States Air Force Academy Preparatory School (usually referred to as the &quot;Prep School&quot;) is a program offered to selected individuals who were not able to obtain appointments directly to the academy. The program involves intense academic preparation (particularly in English, math and science), along with athletic and military training, meant to prepare the students for appointment to the academy. A high percentage of USAFA Preparatory School students (known as &quot;Preppies&quot;) earn appointments to the academy following their year at the Prep School.

==The Honor Code and character education==
The Cadet Honor Code is the cornerstone of a cadet&#x27;s professional training and development – the minimum standard of ethical conduct that cadets expect of themselves and their fellow cadets. The Honor Code was developed and adopted by the Class of 1959, the first class to graduate from the academy and has been handed down to every subsequent class. The Code itself is simple:

&quot;We will not lie, steal, or cheat, nor tolerate among us anyone who does.&quot; 

In 1984, the Cadet Wing voted to add an &quot;Honor Oath,&quot; which was to be taken by all cadets. The oath is administered to fourth class cadets (freshmen) when they are formally accepted into the Wing at the conclusion of Basic Cadet Training. The oath remains unchanged since its adoption in 1984 and consists of a statement of the code, followed by a resolution to live honorably (the phrase &quot;So help me God&quot; is now optional):

Cadets are considered the &quot;guardians and stewards&quot; of the code. Cadet honor representatives are chosen by senior leadership, and oversee the honor system by conducting education classes and investigating suspected honor violations. Cadets throughout the Wing are expected to sit on Honor Boards as juries that determine whether their fellow cadets violated the code. Cadets also recommend sanctions for violations. The presumed sanction for an honor violation is disenrollment, but mitigating factors may result in the violator being placed in a probationary status for some period of time. This &quot;honor probation&quot; is usually only reserved for cadets in their first two years at the academy.

To reinforce the importance of honor, character and integrity to future officers, cadets are given an extensive character and leadership curriculum. The academy&#x27;s Center for Character and Leadership Development provides classroom, seminar, workshop and experiential-based learning programs to all cadets, beginning when they enter Basic Cadet Training and continuing each year through their last semester at the academy. The center&#x27;s programs, when coupled with the Honor Code and Honor System, establish a foundation for the &quot;leaders of character&quot; that the academy aspires to produce.

==Organization==
The academy&#x27;s organization is unusual in a number of respects. Because it is primarily a military unit, much of the academy&#x27;s structure is set up like that of any other Air Force Base. This is particularly true of the non-cadet units—most assigned to the 10th Air Base Wing—that provide base services such as security, communications, and engineering. Because the academy is also a university, however, the organization of the faculty and the Cadet Wing have some aspects that are more similar to the faculty and student body at a civilian college.

===The Cadet Wing===

The student body of the academy is known as the Cadet Wing. The students, called &quot;cadets&quot;, are divided into four classes, based on their year in school, much like a civilian college. They are not referred to as freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors, however, but as fourth-, third-, second- and first class cadets, respectively. Fourth class cadets (freshmen) are often referred to as &quot;doolies,&quot; a term derived from the Greek word δοῦλος (&quot;doulos&quot;) meaning &quot;slave&quot; or &quot;servant.&quot; Members of the three lower classes are also referred to as &quot;4 degrees,&quot; &quot;3 degrees&quot; or &quot;2 degrees&quot; based on their class. First-class cadets (seniors) are referred to as &quot;firsties.&quot; In the military structure of the Cadet Wing, first class cadets hold the positions of cadet officers, second class cadets act as the cadet non-commissioned officers and third class cadets represent the cadet junior non-commissioned officers.

The Cadet Wing is divided into four groups, of ten cadet squadrons each. Each cadet squadron consists of about 110 cadets, roughly evenly distributed among the four classes. Selected first-, second- and third-class cadets hold leadership, operational and support jobs at the squadron, group and wing levels. Cadets live, march and eat meals with members of their squadrons. Military training and intramural athletics are conducted by squadron as well. Each cadet squadron and cadet group is supervised by a specially selected active duty officer called an Air Officer Commanding (AOC). In the case of a cadet squadron, the AOC is normally an active duty Air Force or Space Force major or lieutenant colonel. Occasionally, officers of equivalent rank from the Army, Navy, or Marines may be selected as an AOC for a squadron while on active duty at the academy. For a cadet group, the AOC is normally an active-duty colonel. These officers have command authority over the cadets, counsel cadets on leadership and military career issues, oversee military training and serve as role models for the future officers. In addition to an AOC, cadet squadrons and groups are also supervised by an active duty non-commissioned officer known as an Academy Military Trainer (AMT), who fulfills a similar job as the AOC.

===Base organization===
The superintendent of the United States Air Force Academy is the commander and senior officer. The position of superintendent is normally held by an active-duty lieutenant general. The superintendent&#x27;s role is roughly similar to that of the president of a civilian university. As such, the superintendent oversees all aspects of the academy, including military training, academics, athletics, admissions and also functions as the installation commander of the Academy Reservation. The academy is a Direct Reporting Unit within the Air Force, so the superintendent reports directly to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force.

Those reporting to the superintendent include the vice superintendent, dean of the faculty, commandant of cadets, each of whom typically holds the rank of major general or brigadier general, as well as the director of athletics, the commander of the 10th Air Base Wing and the commander of the Prep School, each of whom typically holds the rank of colonel. The 10th Air Base Wing provides all base support functions that exist at other air force bases, including civil engineering, communications, medical support, personnel, administration, security and base services. The Preparatory School provides an academic, athletic and military program for qualified young men and women who may need certain additional preparation prior to acceptance to the academy. All flying programs at the academy are run by the 306th Flying Training Group, which reports to the Air Education and Training Command, ensuring uniformity of flight training with the rest of the Air Force.

===Board of Visitors===
Congressional oversight of the academy is exercised through a 15-member Board of Visitors (BoV), established under Title 10, United States Code, Section 9455, and governed by the Federal Advisory Committee Act and the BoV Charter. The board inquires into the morale, discipline, curriculum, instruction, physical equipment, fiscal affairs, academic methods and other matters relating to the academy. The board &quot; shall visit the Academy annually&quot; and &quot;typically held at least twice annually with one meeting being at the USAF Academy&quot;. The Board prepares semi-annual reports containing its views and recommendations submitted concurrently to the Secretary of Defense, the Senate Armed Services Committee, and the House Armed Services Committee. The 15 members of the BoV are appointed by the president of the United States, the vice president, the Senate and House Armed Services Committees, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Since 2006, the board has been required to include at least two academy graduates. In July 2009, Speaker Nancy Pelosi appointed Colorado Congressman Jared Polis to the BoV, the first openly gay person to serve on a service academy&#x27;s advisory board.

There was controversy in December 2020 when President Trump made two lame duck appointments to the BoV: Kellyanne Conway and Heidi Stirrup. Secretary of Defense Austin suspended Defense advisory boards for a review in February 2021. President Biden asked them to resign in September 2021. Stirrup sued the Defense Department in July 2021 over the suspension of the board and in an attempt to remain on the board, however, the lawsuit was dismissed on May 9, 2022.

== Based units ==
Numerous regular USAF units are based at the academy. Units marked GSU are Geographically Separate Units, which, although based at the U.S. Air Force Academy, are subordinate to a parent unit based at another location.

== Military training ==


Cadets&#x27; military training occurs throughout their time at the academy, but is especially intense during their four summers. The first military experience for new cadets (called &quot;basic cadets&quot;) occurs during the six weeks of Basic Cadet Training (BCT), in the summer before their fourth class (freshman) year. During BCT, also known as &quot;beast,&quot; cadets learn the fundamentals of military and Academy life under the leadership of a cadre of first and second class cadets. Basic cadets learn military customs and courtesies, proper wear of the uniform, drill and ceremony, and study military knowledge and undergo a rigorous physical training program. During the second half of BCT, basic cadets march to Jacks Valley, where they complete the program in a field encampment environment. Upon completion of BCT, basic cadets receive their fourth-class shoulder boards, take the Honor Oath and are formally accepted as members of the Cadet Wing.

The fourth-class (freshman) year is traditionally the most difficult at the academy, militarily. In addition to their full academic course loads, heavy demands are placed on fourth-class cadets outside of class. Fourth-class cadets are expected to learn an extensive amount of military and Academy-related knowledge and have significant restrictions placed on their movement and actions—traversing the Cadet Area only by approved routes (including staying on the marble &quot;strips&quot; on the Terrazzo) and interacting with upper class cadets using a very specific decorum. The fourth-class year ends with &quot;Recognition,&quot; a physically and mentally demanding several-day event which culminates in the award of the Prop and Wings insignia to the fourth-class cadets, signifying their ascension to the ranks of upper class cadets. After Recognition, the stringent rules of the fourth-class year are relaxed.

After the first year, cadets have more options for summer military training. Between their fourth and third class years, cadets undergo training in interpersonal and small team unit training during Adventure Based Learning (ABL) and may participate in flying gliders, cyber-warfare training, satellite and space operations, unmanned systems, or free-fall parachute training. Until the Summer of 2020, cadets participated in Expeditionary and Survival Training. From the late 1960s until the mid-1990s, cadets also completed SERE training in the Jacks Valley complex between their fourth- and third-class years. This program was replaced with Combat Survival Training (CST) in 1995 and done away with entirely in 2005. In the summer of 2008, the CST program was reintroduced, but was cut again in 2011 and replaced with Expeditionary, Survival, and Evasion Training (ESET) for the summer of 2012 (the Class of 2015 was the first to participate in ESET). During their last two summers, cadets may serve as BCT cadre, travel to active duty Air Force bases and participate in a variety of other research, aviation and leadership programs. They may also be able to take courses offered by other military services, such as the U.S. Army&#x27;s Airborne School at Fort Moore, Georgia, or the Air Assault School, at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. During the academic year, all cadets take formal classes in military theory, operations and leadership.

==Academics==

The Air Force Academy is an accredited four-year university offering bachelor&#x27;s degrees in a variety of subjects. Active-duty Air Force and Space Force officers make up approximately 70 percent of the faculty, with the balance long-term civilian professors, visiting professors from civilian universities and instructors from other U.S. and allied foreign military services. In recent years, civilians have become a growing portion of senior faculty.

Every dean of the faculty (equivalent to a provost at most universities) has always been an active-duty brigadier general, although technically, a civilian may hold the position. The dean, the vice dean, and each academic department chair hold the academic rank of permanent professor. Permanent professors are nominated by the president of the United States and approved by the Senate, and can serve until age 64. The current dean of the faculty is Brigadier General Linell Letendre.

All graduates receive a Bachelor of Science degree, regardless of major, because of the technical content of the core requirements. Cadets may choose from a variety of majors, including engineering, the basic sciences, social sciences and humanities, as well as in a variety of divisional or inter-disciplinary subjects. The academic program has an extensive core curriculum, in which all cadets take required courses in the sciences, engineering, social sciences, humanities, military studies and physical education. Approximately sixty percent of a cadet&#x27;s course load is mandated by the core curriculum. As a result, most of a cadet&#x27;s first two years are spent in core classes. While core requirements remain significant during the third and fourth years, cadets have more flexibility to focus in their major areas of study, allowing them to participate in international and inter-service Academy exchange programs.

Traditionally, the academic program at the Air Force Academy (as with military academies in general) has focused heavily on science and engineering, with the idea that many graduates would be expected to manage complex air, space and information technology systems. As a result, the academy&#x27;s engineering programs have traditionally been ranked highly. Over time, however, the academy broadened its humanities offerings. About 47% of cadets typically select majors in non-technical disciplines. The academy&#x27;s recent implementation of a computer and network security program may represent a return to form.

Externally funded research at the Air Force Academy has been a large and growing part of the technical majors. Air Force has ranked highest of all undergraduate-only universities in federally funded research as reported by the National Science Foundation, surpassing $60 million in 2010. Many cadets are involved in research via their major, coordinated in more than a dozen Academy research centers, including the Institute for Information Technology Applications, the Institute for National Security Studies, the Air Force Humanities Institute, the Eisenhower Center for Space and Defense Studies, the Life Sciences Research Center, the Academy Center for Physics Education Research, among others.

=== Cyber Competition Team ===
The Air Force Academy has a Cyber Competition team that operates under the Dean of the Faculty and the Department of Computer and Cyber Science.

In November 2017, teams from the Air Force Academy took both first and second in a competition against the U.S. Military Academy, the U.S. Naval Academy, and the U.S. Coast Guard Academy at the CyberStakes Live competition in Las Vegas, Nevada.

In March 2019, the team won the Atlantic Council&#x27;s national Cyber 9/12 Strategy Challenge in Washington, DC.

In April 2019, the National Security Agency announced that the U.S. Air Force Academy was the winner of the 2019 NSA Cyber Exercise. The events included forensics, cyber policy, data analysis, software development, and a cyber combat scenario.

In 2018, the USAFA Class of 1968 announced that they would adopt the Cyber Team, with the goal of raising over $500,000 to establish a permanent endowment to cover travel expenses and other costs.

==Athletics==


All cadets at the academy take part in the school&#x27;s extensive athletic program. The program is designed to enhance the physical conditioning of all cadets, to develop the physical skills necessary for officership, to teach leadership in a competitive environment and to build character. The primary elements of the athletic program are intercollegiate athletics, intramural athletics, physical education, and the physical fitness tests.

===Physical education===
Cadets are required to take physical education courses in each of their four years at the academy. All fourth-class cadets are required to take Boxing and Physical Development. All third-class cadets are required to take Swimming (or Basic Swimming), Water Survival, and an individual sport elective such as tennis, racquetball, golf, indoor rock climbing, or Warrior Enhancement Yoga. Second-class cadets are required to take Combatives I &amp; II (unarmed combat) and a team sports elective such as volleyball, basketball, softball, or soccer. First-class cadets are required to take two open elective courses such as Introduction to Combatives, Functional Fitness, Team or Individual Sport Elective(s), Independent Exercise (C1C/C2C cadets only) or Cadet Instructor (C1C/C2C cadets only). Cadets participating in inter-collegiate sports typically have a modified course schedule for completing their required PE courses.

===Physical fitness tests===
Each semester, cadets must pass two athletic fitness tests, the AFT and PFT: a run to measure aerobic fitness, and a 15-minute, 5-event, physical fitness test consisting of pull-ups, a standing long jump, sit-ups, push-ups and a sprint. Failure to pass a fitness test usually results in the cadet being assigned to a reconditioning course until they can pass the test. Repeated failures can lead to disenrollment by the Physical Education Review Committee.

===Intramural athletics===
All cadets are required to compete in intramural athletics for their entire time at the academy, unless they are on-season for intercollegiate athletics. Intramural sports put cadet squadrons against one another in many sports, including basketball, cross-country, flag football, ice hockey, racquetball, flickerball, rugby union, boxing, soccer, mountain biking, softball, team handball, tennis, Ultimate, wallyball and volleyball. Winning the Wing Championship in a given sport is a particular source of pride for a cadet squadron.

===Intercollegiate athletics===
The academy&#x27;s intercollegiate program has 17 men&#x27;s and 10 women&#x27;s NCAA sanctioned teams, nicknamed the &quot;Falcons.&quot; Men&#x27;s teams compete in football, baseball, basketball, ice hockey, cross-country, fencing, golf, gymnastics, indoor and outdoor track, lacrosse, soccer, swimming and diving, tennis, water polo and wrestling. In 1991 the wrestling team won the WAC championship, which was the first ever by any USAFA sports team. Women&#x27;s teams include basketball, cross-country, fencing, gymnastics, indoor and outdoor track, swimming and diving, soccer, tennis and volleyball. The academy fields a coeducational team in rifle. In addition, the academy also sponsors two non-NCAA programs: cheerleading and boxing. The academy also has several club sports, such as rugby, that compete at an intercollegiate level outside of the NCAA.

The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s programs compete in NCAA&#x27;s Division I, with the football team competing in Division I FBS. Most teams are in the Mountain West Conference; however, the wrestling team competes in the Big 12 Conference, the gymnastics teams compete in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation; the men&#x27;s soccer team competes in the Western Athletic Conference; the men&#x27;s hockey team competes in Atlantic Hockey America, the water polo team competes in the West Coast Conference, the coeducational rifle team competes in the Patriot Rifle Conference, and the men&#x27;s lacrosse team competes in the Atlantic Sun Conference. The men&#x27;s boxing team competes in the National Collegiate Boxing Association. For a number of years, only the men&#x27;s teams competed in Division I. Women&#x27;s teams competed in Division II and were once members of the Continental Divide Conference, then the Colorado Athletic Conference. With new NCAA legislation, beginning in 1996, women&#x27;s teams started competing in Division I.

Air Force has traditional service academy rivalries with Navy and Army. The three service academies compete for the Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s Trophy in football each year. Air Force Falcons football has had the best showing of the three, winning the trophy 18 of its 34 years. The academy also has an in-state rivalry with Colorado State University, which is located in Fort Collins and is a fellow member of the Mountain West Conference.

The boxing team, led for 31 years by Coach Ed Weichers, has won 18 national championships. The Academy&#x27;s men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s rugby teams have each won multiple national championships and the women&#x27;s side recently had two players selected for the United States national team. The football team has played in 17 bowl games and the basketball team has had strong showings in the last several years, qualifying for the NCAA tournament and, most recently, making the final four of the 2007 NIT Tournament. The men&#x27;s ice hockey team won the last two Atlantic Hockey conference tournaments, made the first ever appearance by a service academy in the NCAA hockey tournament in 2007, and made a repeat appearance in 2008. The Air Force Academy&#x27;s Men&#x27;s Hockey team recently lost in the &quot;Elite Eight&quot; of hockey in double overtime. This marked the farthest they had gone in the post-season in school history and the longest an Atlantic Hockey Association team has made it into the post-season.

The track and field team has had national and international success. Three women won Division II NCAA titles before the women&#x27;s team moved to Division I competition: Gail Conway (outdoor 400 meters in 1983, outdoor 800 meters in 1984); Jill Wood (indoor 1500 meters in 1988); and Callie Calhoun (indoor and outdoor 3000 meters and outdoor 5000 meters in 1990, indoor 3000 meters and outdoor 10,000 meters in 1991). Three athletes have also won Division I NCAA outdoor titles: Jim Murphy in the 5000 meters in 1964, Dana Pounds in the javelin in 2005 and 2006, and Mahala Norris in the steeplechase in 2021. 1983 alumnus Alonzo Babers won gold medals in the 400 meters and the 4x400 meter relay at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games.

In 2014, Academy Superintendent Lt. Gen. Michelle Johnson responded to reports of allegations of sexual assault and drug use at a December 2011 party by calling for a review of the athletic department by the inspector general.

==Airmanship==

Cadets have the opportunity to take part in several airmanship activities to include soaring, parachuting, and powered flight. Airmanship activities at the academy are primarily conducted by the 306th Flying Training Group.

The 94th Flying Training Squadron trains cadets in basic airmanship principles through several flights in TG-16A sailplanes. Each year, several soaring students are selected to become instructor pilots to teach new classes of soaring students. Some of these cadet instructor pilots also compete on the Soaring Racing Team or Acrobatics Team in national competitions.

Cadets also have the opportunity to take a parachuting course conducted by the 98th Flying Training Squadron. Each year, hundreds of cadets earn their Basic Parachutist Badge by completing five jumps in the program. A number of cadets are selected for further training and become members of The Wings of Blue, the U.S. Air Force Parachute Team.

A powered flight program is conducted under the 557th Flying Training Squadron to expose cadets to the basics of powered flight. The program uses T-53A aircraft to offer cadets basic flight training and the opportunity to solo. The U.S. Air Force Academy Flying Team is composed of ~26 cadets selected to compete in National Intercollegiate Flying Association competitions. The Flying Team uses T-41D and T-51A aircraft to compete in precision landing, navigation, and message drop events.

==Admissions==

To be eligible to enter the academy, a candidate must:

* Be a citizen of the United States (unless nominated by an official of a country invited by the Department of Defense)
* Be unmarried with no dependents
* Be of good moral character
* Be at least 17, but less than 23 years of age by 1 July of the year of entry
* Meet high leadership, academic, physical and medical standards

In addition to the normal application process, all candidates must secure a nomination to the academy, normally from a U.S. Senator or U.S. Representative. Each member of Congress and the vice president can have five appointees attending the Air Force Academy at any time. The process for obtaining a congressional nomination is not political and candidates do not have to know their senator or representative to secure a nomination. Additional nomination slots are available for children of career military personnel, children of disabled veterans or veterans who were killed in action, or children of Medal of Honor recipients. The admissions process is a lengthy one and applicants usually begin the paperwork during their junior year of high school.

===Class size===
There were 306 cadets admitted for the first class (class of 1959). By 1961, class size was down to 271, but due to the need for officers in the Vietnam War, grew to 745 admittees in 1970, and peaking in 1974, with 1,620, and 1975, with 1,626, the largest number ever admitted. After that class sizes shrank down to about 1,300 before spiking to 1,485 in 1988 (class of 1992). Despite a peak of 1,350 (admitted 2004) and 1,418 (admitted 2005), from 1995 to 2005 class size averaged about 1,250 freshmen. From 2005 to 2010 class sizes were slightly down from the 2005 peak. The 2013 class (beginning 2009) had 1,286 and the 2014 class (beginning Fall 2010) had 1,285. Cutbacks were ordered in 2011, so by 2012, the entering class (class of 2016) was down to about 1,050. The class 2022 began with 1,286 students, lowered to 1,282 by the end of BCT. The class of 2023 began with 1159, and ended BCT with approximately 1150.

==Traditions==

===Nicknames===
Alumni of the academy are referred to as the Long Blue Line. Cadets and alumni are also known as Zoomies.

===Prop and Wings===
The Prop and Wings insignia of the Air Service (1918–26), Air Corps (1926–41), and Army Air Forces (1941–47) became the insignia of upperclass cadets at the Air Force Academy beginning with the first class, 1959. The insignia is given to fourth class (freshmen) cadets at the Recognition Ceremony near the end of their first year rite of passage. The standard insignia uses the design of the Air Corps Prop and Wings, except that it is all silver instead of the gold wings and silver prop of the earlier design. Cadets who have ancestors who served in the Air Service, Air Corps, or Army Air Forces, or those who are direct descendants of Air Force Academy graduates, are eligible to wear a different set of props and wings consisting of a silver prop and gold wings.

=== Acceptance Parade and Parents&#x27; Weekend ===
The Acceptance Parade celebrates the end of Basic Cadet Training (BCT) for incoming fourth-class cadets. At the Parade, fourth-class cadets are awarded their uniform shoulder boards in recognition of completing BCT and being accepted into the Cadet Wing. Fourth-class cadets formally take the USAFA Honor Code Oath. The Legacy class, the class that graduated 50 years prior to the incoming class&#x27; graduation, presents a copy of the Contrails book to the outstanding Basic Cadet from each of the ten BCT squadrons.

A few weeks later, over the Labor Day weekend, the Cadet Wing participates in Parents&#x27; Weekend. This event marks the first time that fourth-class cadets are able to see their families since Inprocessing Day. After the Cadet Wing Parade, families are invited into the Cadet Wing to attend open houses.

=== Class exemplar ===
During the fall semester of the third-class year, cadets choose a class exemplar who becomes the class&#x27; namesake. The exemplar is typically a deceased member of the Air Force, Army Air Force, or Army Air Service, with a few notable exceptions like the Wright Brothers and Neil Armstrong. The tradition began with the Class of 2000. The selection of the class exemplar is celebrated with a formal class-wide dinner.

=== Commitment Dinner ===
Commitment Dinner takes place prior to the first day of classes at the start of the second-class fall semester. By attending the dinner, second-class cadets are formally committing serving in the Air Force or Space Force upon graduation. Up until this point, fourth-class or third-class cadets may withdraw from the academy without incurring any financial or military obligations. After Commitment, cadets leaving the academy may incur financial penalties or be required to serve on active duty in the Air Force or Space Force.

=== Class crest ===
Each class of cadets designs its own class crest; the only requirements being that each crest include all the elements on the Class of 1959&#x27;s crest: the class number, the class year, the Polaris star, and the eagle. The final crest is unveiled during the Ring Dance when second-degree cadets receive their class rings. During the first-degree year, the crest is on prominent display on the Crest Wall on the Terrazzo.

===Class ring===
The American college tradition of the class ring began with the class of 1835 at the U.S. Military Academy. From there, it spread to the U.S. Naval Academy in the class of 1869. The Air Force Academy continued the tradition, beginning with the first class, 1959, and so is the only service academy to have had class rings for every class since its founding. The Air Force ring is distinctive for being white gold instead of the yellow gold used at the other academies. One side of the ring bears the academy crest, while the other side bears the class crest; the center bezel bears the words United States Air Force Academy. Cadets choose their own stones for the center of the ring. The rings are received during their second-degree (junior) year at the Ring Dance, at the beginning of Graduation Week festivities for the class ahead. The rings traditionally are placed in glasses of champagne and are caught in the teeth following a toast. During the cadet&#x27;s first-degree (senior) year, the ring is worn with the class crest facing the wearer; following graduation, the ring is turned so that the class crest faces out. The rings of all the academies were originally designed to be worn on the left hand, so that the wearer reads the name of the academy on the bezel while a cadet or midshipman and others can read it after graduation, the rings are now worn on either hand. The academy&#x27;s Association of Graduates (AOG) accepts rings of deceased graduates which are melted down to form an ingot of white gold from which a portion of all future rings are made. Both the academy&#x27;s Association of Graduates and the academy library maintain displays of class rings.

=== 100’s Night ===
100&#x27;s Night takes place 100 nights before first-class cadets (&quot;firsties&quot;) are set to graduate. It is a formal dinner in celebration of all they have accomplished up to this point in their cadet career and their impending commission as Second Lieutenants in the Air Force or Space Force. After the dinner, Firsties are given leave for the weekend to celebrate. While the Firsties are gone, fourth-class cadets decorate their rooms to celebrate.

===Music===
The United States Air Force Academy Band provides all ceremonial and musical support for the cadet wing of the academy. It is an active duty band that is composed of full-time musicians, not USAFA cadets. Established in 1948 in Washington, D.C., the United States Air Force Academy Drum and Bugle Corps on the other hand is staffed by cadets of the academy and provides support for all academy events such as football and basketball games. It served the entire Air Force from the capital until its reassignment to the academy in 1963 and the cadet wing in 1972.

The two bands wear different uniforms when performing, with the academy band performing in a specialized full dress uniform while the drum and bugle corps march in standard cadet uniforms.

==Controversies==

===Honor scandals===
The first honor scandal broke in 1965, when a resigning cadet reported knowing of more than 100 cadets who had been involved in a cheating ring. 109 cadets were ultimately expelled. Cheating scandals plagued the academy again in 1967, 1972, 1984, 2004, 2007, 2012, 2014, 2019, and 2020.

In April 2022, 22 cadets were permanently expelled from the academy due to a May 2020 final exams cheating scandal in which 245 cadets were investigated.

===Allegations of sexual harassment, assault and gender bias===

The sexual assault scandal that broke in 2003 forced the academy to look more closely at how effectively women had been integrated into cadet life; concerns with sexual assault, hazing of male cadets, and the disciplinary process during this period were detailed in a 2010 book by a former cadet. Following the scandal and rising concerns about sexual assault throughout the U.S. military, the Department of Defense established a task force to investigate sexual harassment and assault at each of the United States service academies. The report also revealed 92 incidents of reported sexual assault. At the same time, the academy implemented programs to combat sexual assault, harassment and gender bias. The new programs actively encourage prompt sexual assault reporting. The academy&#x27;s decisive actions of zero tolerance were praised by officials and experts.

Following the 2003 crisis, the Department of Defense directed its attention to the problem of sexual harassment and assault at the military academies. The Department of Defense claimed that the program was successful although during the school year 2010–11 there were increased reports of sexual assault at the academy; however, one goal of the program is increased reporting. There have been several attempts to prosecute cadets for rape since 2003, but only three have resulted in convictions, citing the confidential informant program that ran from 2011 to 2012. The informant program was led by former AFOSI agent Brandon Enos, AFOSI&#x27;s most successful agent in Air Force Academy&#x27;s history in combating sexual assault and drug use among cadets. After the confidential informant program was mysteriously disbanded in 2013 on orders from General Johnson, sexual assault reporting fell by half. On 5 January 2012 rape charges were referred against cadets in three unrelated cases. To help combat these problems, the United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) created a system of cadet informants to hunt for misconduct among students. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot; in academic year 2014, &quot;after the informant program ended with no further convictions, reports fell by half.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; cited a letter to Congress from former AFOSI Agent, Staff Sergeant Brandon Enos, who said that Lieutenant General Michael C. Gould, the superintendent from 2009 to 2013 and a former quarterback on the team, had repeatedly interfered in cases involving football players. In turn Gould said to the Times that the suggestion that he had interfered with the investigation &quot;preposterous.&quot; Gould was found guilty by a report from the Pentagon in June 2016 of interfering with AFOSI investigations from 2011 to 2012, including blocking an investigation into the football coaches. Gould was subsequently removed from the College Football Selection Committee.

These and other problems again rose to national prominence in the summer of 2014 when &quot;The Gazette&quot; broke an investigation into behavior by Academy cadets and faculty that included allegations of drug use, alcohol abuse, cheating, and sexual assault. This behavior, described as &quot;so wild that AFOSI leaders canceled a planned 2012 sting out of concern that undercover agents and confidential informants at a party wouldn&#x27;t be enough to protect women from rape,&quot; prompted the academy superintendent to call for an investigation of the academy&#x27;s athletic department.

A 2023 survey found 22% of female cadets and 4% of male cadets had experienced unwanted sexual contact, ranging from touching to rape.

===Religious atmosphere===
In 2005, allegations surfaced that some evangelical Christian cadets and staff were effectively engaging in religious proselytizing at the academy. These allegations, along with concerns over how the Air Force handles other religious issues, prompted Academy graduate Michael L. Weinstein to file a lawsuit against the Air Force. An Air Force panel investigated the accusations and issued a report on 22 June 2005. The panel&#x27;s investigation found a &quot;religious climate that does not involve overt religious discrimination, but a failure to fully accommodate all members&#x27; needs and a lack of awareness over where the line is drawn between permissible and impermissible expression of beliefs.&quot; Evidence discovered during the investigation included antisemitic remarks, official sponsorship of a showing of the film &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; and a locker room banner that said academy athletes played for &quot;Team Jesus.&quot; In response to the panel&#x27;s findings, the Air Force released new guidelines to discourage public prayers at official events or meetings and to facilitate worship by non-Christian religions.

In 2010 the academy set up an outdoor worship area for cadets following Wicca, Neo-Druidism, or other earth-based religions to practice their faiths. A survey conducted that same year found that 41 percent of academy cadets who identified themselves as non-Christian reported they were subjected to unwanted religious proselytizing at least once or twice last year at the school. The survey&#x27;s results, however, showed that the number of cadets who felt pressured to join in religious activities had declined from previous years. Colorado congressman Mike Coffman criticized the academy for resisting calls to release details of the survey&#x27;s results. Two years later, 66 House Republicans complained about policies set in place the last September to curtail requirements to attend religious events.

=== Hazing incidents ===
Beginning in 2012, the Air Force Academy began to receive sustained, negative attention for unofficial hazing rituals carried out by cadets. Following the 2014 investigation into hazing, alcohol abuse, and cheating on the academy&#x27;s football team, further investigations in 2017 and 2018 into other teams in the athletic department uncovered similar behavior on the academy&#x27;s men&#x27;s lacrosse and men&#x27;s swimming teams. In addition to suspending the coaching staff of the lacrosse team, senior cadets on both the lacrosse and swimming teams have had their graduation and commissioning delayed, and potentially revoked, as the Air Force proceeds with its internal investigations. In an April 2018 statement made on the hazing scandal to the Board of Visitors, which reports its findings to the Pentagon and Congress, Academy Superintendent Lt. Gen. Jay Silveria stated, &quot;Times have changed, and some of these rituals hang on that are completely, ridiculously inappropriate.&quot;

<text>Nicaea (also spelled Nicæa or Nicea, ; ), also known as Nikaia (, , ), was an ancient Greek city in the north-western Anatolian region of Bithynia that is primarily known as the site of the First and Second Councils of Nicaea (the first and seventh Ecumenical councils in the early history of the Christian Church), the Nicene Creed (which comes from the First Council), and as the capital city of the Empire of Nicaea following the Fourth Crusade in 1204, until the recapture of Constantinople by the Byzantines in 1261. Nicaea was also the capital of the Ottomans from 1331 to 1335.

The ancient city is located within the modern Turkish city of İznik (whose modern name derives from Nicaea&#x27;s), and is situated in a fertile basin at the eastern end of Lake Ascanius, bounded by ranges of hills to the north and south. It is situated with its west wall rising from the lake itself, providing both protection from siege from that direction, as well as a source of supplies which would be difficult to cut off. The lake is large enough that it could not be blockaded from the land easily, and the city was large enough to make any attempt to reach the harbour from shore-based siege weapons very difficult.

The ancient city is surrounded on all sides by of walls about high. These are in turn surrounded by a double ditch on the land portions, and also included over 100 towers in various locations. Large gates on the three landbound sides of the walls provided the only entrance to the city. Today, the walls have been pierced in many places for roads, but much of the early work survives; as a result, it is a tourist destination.

==History==

===Early history===

The place is said to have been colonized by Bottiaeans, and to have originally borne the name of Ancore (Ἀγκόρη) or Helicore (Ἑλικόρη), or by soldiers of Alexander the Great&#x27;s army who hailed from Nicaea in Locris, near Thermopylae. The later version, however, was not widespread, even in Antiquity. Whatever the truth, the first Greek colony on the site was probably destroyed by the Mysians, and it fell to Antigonus I Monophthalmus, one of Alexander&#x27;s successors (&quot;Diadochi&quot;) to refound the city as Antigoneia (Ἀντιγονεία) after himself. Antigonus is also known to have established Bottiaean soldiers in the vicinity, lending credence to the tradition about the city&#x27;s founding by Bottiaeans. Following Antigonus&#x27; defeat and death at the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC, the city was captured by Lysimachus, who renamed it Nicaea (, also transliterated as Nikaia or Nicæa; see also List of traditional Greek place names), in tribute to his wife Nicaea, who had recently died.

Sometime before 280 BC, the city came under the control of the local dynasty of the kings of Bithynia. This marks the beginning of its rise to prominence as a seat of the royal court, as well as of its rivalry with Nicomedia. The two cities&#x27; dispute over which one was the pre-eminent city (signified by the appellation &quot;metropolis&quot;) of Bithynia continued for centuries, and the 38th oration of Dio Chrysostom was expressly composed to settle the dispute.

Plutarch mentioned that Menecrates (Μενεκράτης) wrote about the history of the city. In Greek mythology, Nicaea supposedly took its name from Nicaea, a nymph whom the god Dionysus got drunk and raped; he later named the city after her.

=== Roman period ===

Along with the rest of Bithynia, Nicaea came under the rule of the Roman Republic in 72 BC. The city remained one of the most important urban centres of Asia Minor throughout the Roman period, and continued its old competition with Nicomedia over pre-eminence and the location of the seat of the Roman governor of Bithynia et Pontus. The geographer Strabo (XII.565 ff.) described the city as built in the typical Hellenistic fashion with great regularity, in the form of a square, measuring 16 stadia in circumference, i.e. approx. or covering an area of some or ; it had four gates, and all its streets intersected one another at right angles in accordance with the Hippodamian plan, so that from a monument in the centre all the four gates could be seen. This monument stood in the gymnasium, which was destroyed by fire but was restored with increased magnificence by Pliny the Younger, when he was governor there in the early 2nd century AD. In his writings Pliny makes frequent mention of Nicaea and its public buildings.

Emperor Hadrian visited the city in 123 AD after it had been severely damaged by an earthquake and began to rebuild it. The new city was enclosed by a polygonal wall of some 5 kilometres in length. Reconstruction was not completed until the 3rd century, and the new set of walls failed to save Nicaea from being sacked by the Goths in 258 AD. The numerous coins of Nicaea which still exist attest the interest taken in the city by the Roman emperors, as well as its attachment to the rulers; many of them commemorate great festivals celebrated there in honor of gods and emperors, as Olympia, Isthmia, Dionysia, Pythia, Commodia, Severia, Philadelphia, etc.

=== Christian Councils ===

Christianity became a legal religion of the Roman Empire in the reign of Constantine I (also known as Constantine the Great) by the Edict of Milan in 313. Constantine patronized Christianity and supported it by granting privileges, and became the first Roman Emperor to adopt Christianity, but he did not get baptised until just before he died in Nicomedia. Constantine laid the groundwork for the majority of the population to become Christians, predominantly, the empire&#x27;s formal religion in 380.

The Nicene Creed, (; ; ) which declared Jesus to be God, and became the foundation of church doctrine, was adopted at the first Roman Ecumenical Christian council in this city in 325. This council also condemned Gothic Christian Arianism, which was later adopted by many barbarian kingdoms, and led to the destruction of the Western Empire for the century to come.

After shifting the council for four centuries, the Ecumenical Council was held in Nicaea again in 787. This council was called by the Emperor of the Eastern Empire, Constantine VI, Empress Irene, who later became the first female emperor, and attended by Pope Hadrian I. It addressed the iconoclastic controversy and recognized the veneration of Christian images of Jesus and the saints as legitimate. The council also forbade the secular appointment of bishops, thus solidifying the independent authority of the church against that of the state.

=== Byzantine period ===
By the 4th century, Nicaea was a large and prosperous city, and a major military and administrative centre. Emperor Constantine the Great convened the First Ecumenical Council there, and the city gave its name to the Nicene Creed. The city remained important in the 4th century, seeing the proclamation of Emperor Valens (364) and the failed rebellion of Procopius (365). During the same period, the See of Nicaea became independent of Nicomedia and was raised to the status of a metropolitan bishopric. However, the city was hit by two major earthquakes in 363 and 368, and coupled with competition from the newly established capital of the Eastern Empire, Constantinople, it began to decline thereafter. Many of its grand civic buildings began to fall into ruin, and had to be restored in the 6th century by Emperor Justinian I, among them the aqueduct built by Hadrian.

The city disappears from sources thereafter and is mentioned again in the early 8th century: in 715, the deposed emperor Anastasios II fled there, and the city successfully resisted attacks by the Umayyad Caliphate in 716 and 727. The city was again damaged by the 740 Constantinople earthquake, served as the base of the rebellion of Artabasdos in 741/2, and served as the meeting-place of the Second Ecumenical Council, which condemned Byzantine Iconoclasm, in 787 (the council probably met in the basilica of Hagia Sophia). Nicaea became the capital of the Opsician Theme in the 8th century and remained a center of administration and trade. A Jewish community is attested in the city in the 10th century. Due to its proximity to Constantinople, the city was contested in the rebellions of the 10th and 11th centuries as a base from which to threaten the capital. It was in the wake of such a rebellion, that of Nikephoros Melissenos, that it fell into the hands of Melissenos&#x27; Turkish allies in 1081. The Seljuk Turks made Nicaea the capital of their possessions in Asia Minor until 1097, when it returned to Byzantine control with the aid of the First Crusade after a one month siege.

The 12th century saw a period of relative stability and prosperity at Nicaea. The Komnenian emperors Alexios, John and Manuel campaigned extensively to strengthen the Byzantine presence in Asia Minor. Alexios seems to have repaired the aqueduct after the reconquest and major fortifications were constructed across the region, especially by John and Manuel, which helped to protect the city and its fertile hinterland. There were also several military bases and colonies in the area, for example the one at Rhyndakos in Bithynia, where the emperor John spent a year training his troops in preparation for campaigns in southern Asia Minor.

After the fall of Constantinople to the Fourth Crusade in 1204, and the establishment of the Latin Empire, Nicaea escaped Latin occupation and maintained an autonomous stance. From 1206 on, it became the base of Theodore Laskaris, who in 1208 was crowned emperor there and founded the Empire of Nicaea. The Patriarchate of Constantinople, exiled from Constantinople, also took up residence in the city until the recapture of Constantinople in 1261. Although Nicaea was soon abandoned as the primary residence of the Nicene emperors, who favoured Nymphaion and Magnesia on the Maeander, the period was a lively one in the city&#x27;s history, with &quot;frequent synods, embassies, and imperial weddings and funerals&quot;, while the influx of scholars from other parts of the Eastern Roman world made it a centre of learning as well.

After the restoration of the Byzantine Empire in 1261, the city once again declined in importance. The neglect of the Asian frontier by Michael VIII Palaiologos provoked a major uprising in 1262, and in 1265, panic broke out when rumours circulated of an imminent Mongol attack. Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos visited the city in 1290 and took care to restore its defences, but Byzantium proved unable to halt the rise of the nascent Ottoman emirate in the region. After Emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos and John Kantakouzenos were defeated at Pelekanon on 11 June 1329, the Byzantine government could no longer defend Nicaea. Nicaea finally surrendered to the Ottomans after a long siege 2 March 1331.

===Ottoman Empire===

In 1331, Orhan captured the city from the Byzantines and for a short period the town became the capital of the expanding Ottoman emirate. Many of its public buildings were destroyed, and the materials were used by the Ottomans in erecting their mosques and other edifices. The large church of Hagia Sophia in the centre of the town was converted into a mosque and became known as the Orhan Mosque. A madrasa and baths were built nearby. In 1334 Orhan built a mosque and an &quot;imaret&quot; (soup kitchen) just outside the Yenişehir gate (Yenişehir Kapısı) on the south side of the town. With the fall of Constantinople in 1453, the town lost a great degree of its importance, but later became a major centre with the creation of a local faïence pottery industry in the 17th century. Thereafter, it slowly faded away as it lost population. In 1779, the Italian archaeologist Domenico Sestini wrote that it was nothing but an abandoned town with no life, no noise and no movement.

==Ruins==
===City walls===

The ancient walls, with their towers and gates, are relatively well preserved. Their circumference is , being at the base from in thickness, and from in height; they contain four large and two small gates. In most places they are formed of alternate courses of Roman tiles and large square stones, joined by a cement of great thickness. In some places columns and other architectural fragments from the ruins of more ancient edifices have been inserted. As with those of Constantinople, the walls seem to have been built in the 4th century. Some of the towers have Greek inscriptions.

===Inner city structures===
The ruins of mosques, baths, and houses, dispersed among the gardens and apartment buildings that now occupy a great part of the space within the Roman and Byzantine fortifications, show that the Ottoman-era town center, though now less considerable, was once a place of importance; but it never was as large as the Byzantine city. It seems to have been almost entirely constructed of the remains of the Byzantine-era Nicaea, the walls of the ruined mosques and baths being full of the fragments of ancient Greek, Roman, and Byzantine temples and churches.

In the northwestern parts of the town, two moles extend into the lake and form a harbour; but the lake in this part has much retreated, and left a marshy plain. Outside the walls are the remnants of an ancient aqueduct.

===Church of the Dormition===
The Church of the Dormition, the principal Greek Orthodox church in Nicaea, was one of the most architecturally important Byzantine churches in Asia Minor. A domed church with a cross-shaped nave and elongated apse, and dating from the perhaps as early as the end of the 6th century, its bema was decorated with very fine mosaics that had been restored in the 9th century. The Church of the Dormition was destroyed by the Turks in 1922; only the lower portions of some of its walls survive today.

===Ottoman kilns===
Excavations are underway in the Ottoman kilns where the historic Nicean tiles were made.

===Hagia Sophia church===
The Hagia Sophia church of Nicaea is undergoing restoration.

===Underwater basilica===
Under the shallow waters on the margin of Lake Iznik, at a site still located on firm ground on the lakeshore in Byzantine times, the ruins of a 4th-century basilica were found. It might well be the site of the First Council of Nicaea.

===Herakles relief===
Eight kilometers from the city there is an ancient, human-size, Herakles relief engraved on a rock.

==See of Nicaea==
The bishopric of Nicaea remains as a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church, which has left the seat vacant since the death of its last titular bishop in 1976. It is also a titular metropolitan see of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. The incumbent 2001–2010 was the former Archbishop of Karelia and All Finland, Metropolitan Johannes (Rinne).

==People==
*Hipparchus (BC ca.190 - ca.120), Greek astronomer, geographer, and mathematician.
*Cassius Dio (AD ca.150 – ca.235), Roman historian.
*Sporus of Nicaea (ca.240 – ca.300), Greek mathematician and astronomer

<doc id="77590" wikidata="Q158286" url="?curid=77590" title="Anemone">
<text>Anemone () is a genus of flowering plants in the buttercup family Ranunculaceae. Plants of the genus are commonly called windflowers. They are native to the temperate and subtropical regions of all regions except Australia, New Zealand, and Antarctica. The genus is closely related to several other genera including &quot;Anemonoides&quot;, &quot;Anemonastrum&quot;, &quot;Hepatica&quot;, and &quot;Pulsatilla&quot;. Some botanists include these genera within &quot;Anemone&quot;.

==Description==

&quot;Anemone&quot; are perennials that have basal leaves with long leaf-stems that can be upright or prostrate. Leaves are simple or compound with lobed, parted, or undivided leaf blades. The leaf margins are toothed or entire.

Flowers with 4–27 sepals are produced singly, in cymes of 2–9 flowers, or in umbels, above a cluster of leaf- or sepal-like bracts. Sepals may be any color. The pistils have one ovule. The flowers have nectaries, but petals are missing in the majority of species.

The fruits are ovoid to obovoid shaped achenes that are collected together in a tight cluster, ending variously lengthened stalks; though many species have sessile clusters terminating the stems. The achenes are beaked and some species have feathery hairs attached to them.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Anemone&quot; was named by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 and is situated in the tribe Anemoneae, subfamily Ranunculoideae, and the family Ranunculaceae. As considered in the broader sense (&quot;sensu lato&quot;) the genus is sometimes considered to include a number of other genera, such as &quot;Anemonoides&quot;, &quot;Anemonastrum&quot;, &quot;Hepatica&quot;, &quot;Pulsatilla&quot;, &quot;Knowltonia&quot;, &quot;Barneoudia&quot;, and &quot;Oreithales&quot;. Several of these were included as separate genera within Anemoneae by Wang &quot;et al.&quot;, a tribe with six genera in total.

Early molecular analyses divided the genus into two subgenera (&quot;Anemonidium&quot; and &quot;Anemone&quot;), with seven sections, and 12 informal subsections. Ziman and colleagues (2008) treated the genus &quot;Anemone&quot; as 5 subgenera, 23 sections, 4 subsections, 23 series and about 118 species. A further reclassification by Hoot and colleagues (2012) estimated 200 species.

Hoot &quot;et al.&quot; found many of the previously defined subdivisions, based on morphological characteristics were polyphyletic or paraphyletic. In contrast two clearly defined monophyletic clades emerged corresponding to the above two subgenera. &quot;Anemonidium&quot; demonstrated four subclades, corresponding to sections. The larger subgenus &quot;Anemone&quot; showed a similar pattern.

Hoot &quot;et al.&quot; proposed the following two subgenera and several sections be retained, with a number of subsections and series:
* &quot;Anemone&quot; subg. &quot;Anemonidium&quot; 
** &quot;A.&quot; subg. &quot;Anemonidium&quot; sect. &quot;Hepatica&quot; 
** &quot;A.&quot; subg. &quot;Anemonidium&quot; sect. &quot;Keiskea&quot; 
** &quot;A.&quot; subg. &quot;Anemonidium&quot; sect. &quot;Anemonidium&quot; 
** &quot;A.&quot; subg. &quot;Anemonidium&quot; sect. &quot;Omalocarpus&quot; 
* &quot;Anemone&quot; subg. &quot;Anemone&quot; 
** &quot;A.&quot; subg. &quot;Anemone&quot; sect. &quot;Pulsatilloides&quot; 
** &quot;A.&quot; subg. &quot;Anemone&quot; sect. &quot;Pulsatilla&quot; 
** &quot;A.&quot; subg. &quot;Anemone&quot; sect. &quot;Rivularidium&quot; 
** &quot;A.&quot; subg. &quot;Anemone&quot; sect. &quot;Anemone&quot;

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, Greek () means &#x27;daughter of the wind&#x27;, from (, &#x27;wind&#x27;) + feminine patronymic suffix (, so &#x27;daughter of&#x27;). 

The &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; of Ovid says that the plant was created by the goddess Aphrodite when she sprinkled nectar on the blood of her dead lover Adonis, suggesting the frailty of the petals that can be easily blown away by the wind. &quot;Anemone&quot; may also refer to Nea&#x27;man, the Phoenician name for Adonis, from an earlier Syrian myth of the god of vegetation, who was killed by the tusks of a wild boar. The common name windflower is used for the entire genus.

==Ecology==

===Diseases and pests===

&quot;Anemone&quot; species are sometimes targeted by cutworms, the larvae of noctuid moths such as angle shades and heart and dart.

==Cultivation==

Some of the species are grown in gardens. Their popularity varies by species and region. In addition to certain straight species being available, hybrids and cultivars are available for certain species. Certain species, such as &quot;Anemone coronaria&quot;, are typically only available in hybrid form while others, such as &quot;Anemonoides blanda&quot; are nearly always sold in straight species form.

Cultivated anemones are nearly always one of the following colors: bluish violet, white, pink, red, and hues in a range between violet and pink. There are no truly blue anemones, despite the frequent use of the label &quot;blue&quot; in marketing to describe blue-violet flowers (flowers that are more violet than blue). Color labelling inaccuracy in marketing is found in treatments of numerous other genera, especially as it concerns the color blue — although some popular garden flowers from the same family are actually blue, such as some selections from &quot;Delphinium&quot;. One species of anemone, &quot;Anemone ranunculoides&quot;, is unusual for its yellow flowers. 
In horticultural terms there are three main groups:

# spring-flowering species found in woodland and alpine meadows, often tuberous or rhizomatous; e.g. &quot;Anemonoides nemorosa&quot;, &quot;Anemonoides blanda&quot;
# spring- and summer-flowering species from hot dry areas, with tuberous roots, e.g. &quot;Anemone coronaria&quot;
# summer- and autumn-flowering species with fibrous roots, which thrive in moist dappled shade; e.g. &quot;Eriocapitella hupehensis&quot;

The spring-flowering autumn-planted ephemeral species &quot;Anemonoides blanda&quot; is grown in large-scale commercial cultivation and can be purchased in bulk quantities. It is most commonly-available with a bluish violet flower (usually erroneously called &quot;Blue Shades&quot; despite its flower being more purple than blue) that varies from intense to pale, depending upon the individual plant and possibly soil conditions. A white-flowered form is the second-most common type. The least common of the commonly-cultivated forms is a pale pink. The violet, and especially pink, forms sometimes possess petals that fade to white near the flower center. The genus contains quite a number of other spring-flowering species. &quot;A. hortensis&quot; and the hybrid &quot;A. fulgens&quot; have less-divided leaves than some others and have rose-purple or scarlet flowers.

Among the most well-known anemones is &quot;A. coronaria&quot;, often called the poppy anemone. It is a tuberous-rooted plant with parsley-like divided leaves and large poppy-like blossoms on stalks of from 15–20 cm high. It can be planted in the fall in zones 7 or 8 without extra protection or in spring in cooler zones. If planted in fall it will flower in the spring and if planted in the spring it will flower in late summer. The flowers are typically scarlet, crimson, bluish purple, reddish purple, or white. There are also double-flowered varieties, in which the stamens in the centre are replaced by a tuft of narrow petals. It has been used as a garden plant, in hybrid form in particular, for a long time in some parts of the world. Double forms are named varieties. Hybrids of the de Caen and St. Brigid groups are the most prevalent on the market. In Israel, large numbers of red-flowering non-hybrid &quot;A. coronaria&quot; can be seen growing in certain natural areas.

&quot;Eriocapitella hupehensis&quot;, and its white cultivar &#x27;Honorine Joubert&#x27;, the latter especially, are well-known autumn-flowering selections. They grow well in well-drained but moisture-retentive soil and reach 60–100 cm in height, blooming continually for several weeks. &quot;E. hupehensis&quot;, &quot;E. vitifolia&quot;, and their hybrids and are particularly attractive to honeybees. A number of low-growing species, such as the native British &quot;Anemonoides nemorosa&quot; and &quot;Anemonoides apennina&quot;, have woodlands and other shady places as their habitat. &quot;Hepatica&quot; species typically also grow in shade.

Garden-cultivated anemones generally grow best in a loamy well-drained evenly-moist fertile soil, although the ephemeral &quot;A. blanda&quot; does not require as much moisture during the summer when it is dormant (unlike the related &quot;Eranthis&quot; species that can suffer if they become too dry even while dormant). Some prairie species that are rarely cultivated, such as &quot;Anemone cylindrica&quot;, grow well in drier warmer conditions and poor soil. &quot;A. coronaria&quot; has been described by some professional sources as preferring acidic soil and by others as preferring alkaline soil. Hardy species may be planted in October in many zones. Unlike a hardier species such as &quot;A. blanda&quot;, &quot;A. coronaria&quot; is described as hardy only as low as climate zone 7 by some sources and by others hardy only as low as zone 8. Various strategies, such as the use of protection, can be tried to plant them outdoors in fall in zone 6 but results may vary. As with other plants, some species can be readily raised from seed while some hybrids may be sterile. &quot;A. blanda&quot; typically blooms in mid spring. The larger anemone species typically grow well in partial shade, or in full sun provided they are shielded from the hottest sun in southern areas. A well-drained soil, enriched with compost, is typically utilized.

If cut flowers are desired, it is best to harvest the flowers early in the morning while it is still cold outside while the bloom is still closed. To open your flowers place in room temperature water out of direct sun. &quot;A. coronaria&quot; blooms can be purchased from some florists, between November and June depending upon availability.

==Anemones in culture==
&quot;Anemone&quot; has several different meanings depending on the culture and context in which the flower is being used.

Several Western meanings of anemone flowers pertain to the Greek mythology of the origin of the anemone flower featuring Adonis and Aphrodite. The goddess Aphrodite kept the mortal man Adonis as a lover; when Adonis was gored by a wild boar, Aphrodite&#x27;s tears at his death mixed with his blood and gave rise to the anemone. In other versions, the boar was sent by other jealous Greek gods to murder Adonis. These origin stories reflect the classical dual meanings of the arrival of spring breezes and the death of a loved one.

In the Victorian language of flowers, the anemone(Anemone Nemorosa) represented a forsaken love of any kind, while European peasants carried them to ward off pests and disease as well as bad luck.

In other cultures, the meanings differ. In Chinese and Egyptian cultures, the flower of anemone was considered a symbol of illness due to its coloring. The anemone can be a symbol of bad luck in Eastern cultures. The Japanese anemone may be associated with ill tidings.

The flowers are featured in &quot;Robe violette et Anémones&quot;, a 1937 painting by Henri Matisse

<doc id="77591" wikidata="Q158984" url="?curid=77591" title="Dianthus caryophyllus">
<text>Dianthus caryophyllus ( ), commonly known as carnation or clove pink, is a species of &quot;Dianthus&quot; native to the Mediterranean region. Its exact natural range is uncertain due to extensive cultivation over the last 2,000 years. Carnations are prized for their vibrant colors, delicate fringed petals, and fragrance.

The scent of carnations is often described as spicy, clove-like, or reminiscent of a combination of cinnamon and nutmeg, hence the common name &quot;clove pink&quot;. This aroma has made carnations a popular choice for use in perfumes, potpourri, and scented products.

They have cultural significance and are associated with love, distinction, and motherly affection. With numerous cultivars and hybrids, carnations offer a wide variety of colors and forms, making them popular for gardens, floral arrangements, and scented products. Overall, carnations are enduring symbols of beauty and grace, treasured by flower enthusiasts and used to convey heartfelt emotions.

==Taxonomy==

Carnations were mentioned in Greek literature 2,000 years ago. The term &quot;dianthus&quot; was coined by Greek botanist Theophrastus, and is derived from the Ancient Greek words for divine (&quot;dios&quot;) and flower (&quot;anthos&quot;). The name &quot;carnation&quot; is believed to come from the Latin , a &quot;wreath, garland, chaplet, crown&quot;, as it was one of the flowers used in Greek and Roman ceremonial crowns, or possibly from the Latin &#x27; (genitive &#x27;), &quot;flesh&quot;, which refers to the natural colour of the flower, or in Christian iconography &quot;incarnatio&quot;, &quot;incarnation&quot;, God made flesh in the form of Jesus.

Carl Linnaeus described the carnation in volume one of his &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; in 1753, giving it the name &quot;Dianthus caryophyllus&quot;.

Although originally applied to the species &quot;Dianthus caryophyllus&quot;, the name carnation is also often applied to some of the other species of &quot;Dianthus&quot;, and more particularly to garden hybrids between &quot;D. caryophyllus&quot; and other species in the genus.

==Description==
&quot;Dianthus caryophyllus&quot; is a herbaceous perennial plant growing up to 80 cm (3½ in) tall. (Correction needed) The leaves are glaucous greyish green to blue-green, slender, up to 15 cm (6 in) long. The flowers are produced singly or up to five together in a cyme; they are around 3–5 cm (1¼–2 in) diameter, and sweetly scented; the original natural flower color is bright pinkish-purple, but cultivars of other colors, including red, pink, yellow, white, and green have been developed. While sometimes dyed blue for cut bouquets, there are no known carnation cultivars that produce a true blue flower. The fragrant, hermaphrodite flowers have a radial symmetry. The four to six surrounding the calyx, egg-shaped, sting-pointed scales leaves are only ¼ as long as the calyx tube.

==Distribution and habitat==
The wild carnation is found in the Mediterranean countries of Portugal, Spain, Italy, Croatia, Albania, Greece and Turkey.

==Cultivation and uses==

Carnations require well-drained, neutral to slightly alkaline soil, and full sun. Numerous cultivars have been selected for garden planting. Typical examples include &#x27;Gina Porto&#x27;, &#x27;Helen&#x27;, &#x27;Laced Romeo&#x27;, and &#x27;Red Rocket&#x27;. They are used for medical purposes, such as for upset stomach and fever. Their fragrance was historically used for vinegar, beer, wine, sauces and salads.

Crossbreeding &quot;D. caryophyllus&quot; with &quot;D. capitatus&quot; results in a hybrid that is resistant to bacterial wilt from &quot;Paraburkholderia caryophylli&quot;. However, the flower is less attractive and so more breeding and backcrossing is needed to improve the flower.

Carnation cultivars with no fragrance are often used by men as boutonnières or &quot;buttonholes&quot;.

==Diseases==
==Symbolism==

===Traditional meanings===
For the most part, carnations express love, fascination, and distinction, though there are many variations dependent on color.
* Along with the red rose, the red carnation can be used as a symbol of socialism and the labour movement, and historically has often been used in demonstrations on International Workers&#x27; Day (May Day).
* In China, the carnation flower is the most frequently used flower in weddings.
* In Portugal, bright red carnations were used when in 1974 the authoritarian Estado Novo regime was overthrown; therefore, this transition (brought about by a combination of a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; with civil resistance) is known as the Carnation Revolution.
* Light red carnations represent admiration, while dark red denote deep love and affection.
* White carnations represent pure love and good luck, while striped (variegated) carnations symbolise regret that a love cannot be shared.
* In the Netherlands, white carnations are associated with Prince Bernhard. He wore one during World War II and in a gesture of defiance some of the Dutch population took up this gesture. After the war the white carnation became a sign of the Prince, veterans and remembrance of the resistance.
* Purple carnations indicate capriciousness. In France, it is a traditional funeral flower, given in condolence for the death of a loved one.
* Carnation is the birth flower for those born in the month of January.
*Since Ottoman times, red carnations and tulips are used in the interior wall paintings of mosques in Turkey. It is often said that while tulips represent God, carnations is the symbol for Muhammad. However these flower designs are not unique to mosques but also used in many other Ottoman traditional art forms.
*In Azerbaijan, red carnations has turned into a symbol of mourning after the usage of the flower during Black January events of 1990, a violent crackdown on the civilian population of the country by USSR troops.
*In the United States, former U.S. President William McKinley considered the red carnation to be his lucky flower and often wore one on his lapel. Following his assassination in 1901, the State of Ohio adopted the red carnation as its state flower to honor McKinley

The formal name for carnation, &quot;dianthus&quot;, comes from Greek for &quot;heavenly flower&quot;, or the flower of Jove.

===Holidays and events===
Carnations are often worn on special occasions, especially Mother&#x27;s Day and weddings. In 1907, Anna Jarvis chose a carnation as the emblem of Mother&#x27;s Day because it was her mother&#x27;s favourite flower. This tradition is now observed in the United States and Canada on the second Sunday in May. Ann Jarvis chose the white carnation because she wanted to represent the purity of a mother&#x27;s love. This meaning has evolved over time, and now a red carnation may be worn if one&#x27;s mother is alive, and a white one if she has died.

In Slovenia, red carnations are sometimes also given to women on Women&#x27;s Day, the 8th of March, however, nowadays orchids or roses are often given as well.

In Korea, carnations express admiration, love and gratitude. Red and pink carnations are worn on Parents Day (Korea does not separate Mother&#x27;s Day or Father&#x27;s Day, but has Parents Day on 8 May). Sometimes, parents wear a corsage of carnation(s) on their left chest on Parents Day. Carnations are also worn on Teachers Day (15 May).

Red carnations are worn on May Day as a symbol of socialism and the labour movement in some countries, such as Austria, Italy, and successor countries of the former Yugoslavia. The red carnation is also the symbol of the Carnation Revolution in Portugal thanks to Celeste Caeiro.

Green carnations are for St. Patrick&#x27;s Day and were famously worn by the Irish writer Oscar Wilde. The green carnation thence became a symbol of homosexuality in the early 20th century, especially through the book &quot;The Green Carnation&quot; and Noël Coward&#x27;s song, &quot;We All Wear a Green Carnation&quot; in his operetta, &quot;Bitter Sweet&quot;.

In communist Czechoslovakia and in Poland in times of the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland, carnations were traditionally given to women on the widely celebrated Women&#x27;s Day, together with commodities that were difficult to obtain due to the countries&#x27; communist system, such as tights, towels, soap and coffee.

After the 1990 uprisings against Soviets in Azerbaijan in which 147 Azerbaijani civilians were killed, 800 people were injured and five people went missing, the carnation has become a symbol of the Black January tragedy associated with the carnations thrown into the puddles of blood shed in the streets of Azerbaijan subsequent to the massacre.

At the University of Oxford, carnations are traditionally worn to all examinations; white for the first exam, pink for exams in between, and red for the last exam. One story explaining this tradition relates that initially a white carnation was kept in a red inkpot between exams, so by the last exam it was fully red; the story is thought to originate in the late 1990s.

Carnations are the traditional first wedding anniversary flower.

Carnations are also known as the &quot;Flower of God&quot;. The Greek name for Carnation is a fusion of &quot;dios&quot; and &quot;anthos&quot;. Dios is used the described Zeus while Anthos means flower; thus the name &quot;flower of God&quot; is attached to it.

===Symbols of territorial entities and organizations===
The carnation is the national flower of Spain, Monaco, and Slovenia, and the provincial flower of the autonomous community of the Balearic Islands. The state flower of Ohio is a scarlet carnation, which was introduced to the state by Levi L. Lamborn. The choice was made to honor William McKinley, Ohio governor and U.S. president, who was assassinated in 1901, and regularly wore a scarlet carnation on his lapel.

==Colours==

Carnations do not naturally produce the pigment delphinidin, and thus a blue carnation cannot occur by natural selection or be created by traditional plant breeding. It shares this characteristic with other widely sold flowers like roses, lilies, tulips, chrysanthemums and gerberas.

Around 1996, a company, Florigene, used genetic engineering to extract certain genes from petunia and snapdragon flowers to produce a blue-mauve carnation, which was commercialized as &quot;Moondust&quot;. In 1998, a violet carnation called &quot;Moonshadow&quot; was commercialized. As of 2004, three additional blue-violet/purple varieties have been commercialized.

<text>Fritillaria imperialis, the crown imperial, imperial fritillary, Kaiser&#x27;s crown, or Kurdish tulip is a species of flowering plant in the lily family Liliaceae, native to a wide stretch from the Anatolian plateau of Turkey, Iraq and Iran (e.g. Kurdistan) to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Northern India and the Himalayan foothills. It is also widely cultivated as an ornamental and reportedly naturalized in Austria, Sicily, and Washington State, USA. The common names and also the epithet &quot;imperialis&quot;, literally &quot;of the emperor&quot;, refer to the large circle of golden flowers, reminiscent of an emperor&#x27;s crown.

==Description==

&quot;Fritillaria imperialis&quot; grows to about in height, and bears lance-shaped, glossy leaves at intervals along the stem. It bears a prominent whorl of downward facing flowers at the top of the stem, topped by a &#x27;crown&#x27; of small leaves, hence the name. While the wild form is usually orange-red, various colours are found in cultivation, ranging from nearly a true scarlet through oranges to yellow. The pendulous flowers make a bold statement in the late spring garden; in the northern hemisphere, flowering takes place in late spring, accompanied by a distinctly foxy odour that repels mice, moles and other small animals.

Owing to its large size, &quot;F. imperialis&quot; is pollinated by the Eurasian blue tit, which makes it a rare example of ornithophily at northern latitudes.

==Cultivation==
The species and the yellow-flowered &#x27;Maximea Lutea&#x27; have both gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. Other cultivars in shades of red, yellow and orange, are available.

Like other members of the lily family, &quot;F. imperialis&quot; is susceptible to depredation by the scarlet lily beetle (&quot;Lilioceris lilii&quot;).

Fritillaria imperialis is easy to grow in well-drained soil in a sunny site. The plant is drought tolerant, and bulbs should be planted in the early autumn. Note that bulbs do not like to be out in the air for long.

==Taxonomy==
A few names have been coined for taxa once considered as belonging to &quot;Fritillaria imperialis&quot; but now regarded as distinct species:
* &quot;Fritillaria imperialis&quot; var. &quot;chitralensis&quot;, now called &quot;Fritillaria chitralensis&quot;
* &quot;Fritillaria imperialis&quot; var. &quot;eduardii&quot;, now called &quot;Fritillaria eduardii&quot;
* &quot;Fritillaria imperialis&quot; var. &quot;inodora&quot;, now called &quot;Fritillaria eduardii&quot; var. &quot;inodora&quot;
* &quot;Fritillaria imperialis&quot; var. &quot;inodora-purpurea&quot;, now called &quot;Fritillaria eduardii&quot; var. &quot;eduardii&quot;
==Role in the culture of Iran==
The flower has a long and deep connection with the history, religion, mythology and folklore of its native Iran and, as a result, has acquired a wealth of evocative vernacular names, often referencing the pendent form of the blossoms and the tear-like nectar drops borne by the six nectaries. In Iranian folklore the nodding flowers are described (in comparison with the upright flowers of tulips) as being &#x27;upside-down&#x27;, this curious posture being attributed to the plant&#x27;s bowing its (originally upright) &#x27;head&#x27; in sorrow upon the death of a mythological or religious personage. Likewise, the glistening drops of nectar at the base of each flower are described as the tears which the plant weeps in mourning the departed. Depictions of the distinctive inflorescences may be seen on the sculpted capitals of Sassanid columns, as at Taq-e Bostan. &quot;F. imperialis&quot; is linked to the legend of the tragic death of Siyâvash, (a semi-divine hero in Ferdowsi&#x27;s prodigious national epic Shahnameh) – whence the common name &quot;Ashk-e Sivash&quot; (&#x27;Tear of Siyâvash&#x27;).

<text>Blossoms in the Dust is a 1941 American biographical drama film directed by Mervyn LeRoy and starring Greer Garson, Walter Pidgeon, Felix Bressart, Marsha Hunt, Fay Holden and Samuel S. Hinds. It tells the story of Edna Gladney, who helped orphaned children find homes and began a campaign to remove the word &quot;illegitimate&quot; from Texas birth certificates, despite the opposition of &quot;good&quot; citizens. The screenplay was by Anita Loos, with a story by Ralph Wheelwright. Some of the important aspects of her life fictionalized in the film are the fact that it was Edna herself who was born out of wedlock; she and Sam eloped on the eve of her marriage to someone else, and they had much more time together before his death (26 years) than given them in the film.

The film was one of the biggest hits of 1941 for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and began the rise of Greer Garson as one of the largest stars of the decade. &quot;Blossoms in the Dust&quot; won an Oscar for Best Art Direction-Interior Decoration, Color, and was nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Garson), Best Cinematography, Color, and Best Picture.

==Plot==
Edna Kahly and her adopted sister Charlotte are both to be married. However, when Charlotte&#x27;s mother-in-law-to-be discovers that Charlotte was a foundling, she declares the wedding must not occur, and Charlotte kills herself from shame. Meanwhile, Edna falls for Sam Gladney, a brash cashier at a bank, and eventually marries him and moves with him to his home state of Texas.

Sam Gladney has a flour mill in Sherman, Texas, and at first, the couple has an idyllic life, though after a difficult delivery Sam is told Edna must have no more children. Several years later, their son dies, and Sam&#x27;s effort to ease the pain she still endures by trying to get her to adopt a foundling fails. However, the little girl&#x27;s story touches Edna&#x27;s heart, and she starts a day care center for the children of working women.

Sam&#x27;s business fails, and they must auction off all their possessions. The local women take over the day care center, and Sam and Edna move to Fort Worth, Texas, where he runs a mill. Edna starts a home for orphans and extramarital children, and works hard to find them appropriate homes, matching parents to child by interests and inclinations. Sam becomes ill and dies. When a young woman comes to try to donate a large sum of money, Edna worms the young woman&#x27;s story out of her, and discovers she is in a similar situation as poor Charlotte. After insisting the girl&#x27;s fiancé won&#x27;t care that her parents weren&#x27;t married, she decides to campaign to have the word &quot;illegitimate&quot; removed from Texas birth certificates.

After succeeding in her quest, Edna faces one more trial—the little crippled boy Tony she raised from an infant and nursed back to health, finds a new home at last. She is reluctant to let him go, but as she takes in two new foundlings, brought to her door by a policeman, she at last realizes it is for the best.

==Production==
The film was directed by Mervyn LeRoy and produced by Irving Asher. Anita Loos wrote the screenplay, and Ralph Wheelwright the story. Mildred Cram, Dorothy Yost and Hugo Butler made uncredited contributions to the script.

==Reception ==
When the film premiered at Radio City Music Hall, Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;There is a shade too much of shining nobility in this film, too often tiny fingers tug deliberately on the heartstrings. And the dramatic continuity seems less spontaneous than contrived. The career of Mrs. Gladney is drawn out over a tedious stretch of time. But it is an affecting story and one which commands great respect ... As pure inspirational drama with a pleasant flavor of romance, &#x27;Blossoms in the Dust&#x27; should reach a great many hearts.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;a worthy production on which much care has been showered by Mervyn LeRoy and others, but it is questionable as to draft. Though meritorious as to production value, cast and background, plus being in color, the picture fails to impress as being big.&quot; The review also called the film &quot;a trifle over-done on occasion.&quot;

&quot;Film Daily&quot; wrote &quot;Mervyn LeRoy is at his directorial best here, and makes the most of the fine screenplay fashioned by Anita Loos ... Greer Garson&#x27;s performance is rousing, and that of Walter Pidgeon, as her husband, as inspiring as will be found in any &#x27;40-&#x27;41 picture.&quot;

John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote &quot;The subject matter receives very conventional treatment of the inspirational order, with an occasional tear, and, of course, a sad smile here and there.&quot;

&quot;Blossoms in the Dust&quot; placed tenth on &quot;Film Daily&quot;&#x27;s year-end poll of 548 critics naming the best films of 1941.

<doc id="77594" wikidata="Q732510" url="?curid=77594" title="Gaillardia">
<text>Gaillardia (common name blanket flower) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae, native to North and South America. It was named after Maître Gaillard de Charentonneau, an 18th-century French magistrate who was an enthusiastic botanist. The common name may refer to the resemblance of the inflorescence to the brightly patterned blankets made by Native Americans, or to the ability of wild taxa to blanket the ground with colonies. Many cultivars have been bred for ornamental use.

==Description==

These are annual or perennial herbs or subshrubs, sometimes with rhizomes. The stem is usually branching and erect to a maximum height around 80 centimeters (31.5 inches). The leaves are alternately arranged. Some taxa have only basal leaves. They vary in shape. They are glandular in most species. The inflorescence is a solitary flower head. The head can have 15 or more ray florets, while some taxa lack any ray florets. They can be almost any shade of yellow, orange, red, purplish, brown, white, or bicolored. They are sometimes rolled into a funnel shape. There are many tubular disc florets at the center of the head in a similar range of colors, and usually tipped with hairs. The fruit usually has a pappus of scales.

==Ecology==
&quot;Gaillardia&quot; species are used as food plants by the caterpillars of some Lepidoptera species, including &quot;Schinia bina&quot; (which has been recorded on &quot;G. pulchella&quot;), &quot;Schinia masoni&quot; (which feeds exclusively on &quot;G. aristata&quot;) and &quot;Schinia volupia&quot; (which feeds exclusively on &quot;G. pulchella&quot;).

==Symbolism==
It is the official flower of Wallonia.&lt;br&gt;
The school colors of Texas State University are maroon and old gold, a combination inspired by the gaillardia.

<text>Sparaxis tricolor, known by the common names wandflower, harlequin flower, and sparaxis, is a bulb-forming perennial plant that grows in well-drained sunny soil. It gained its name from its colorful flowers which are bi- or tri-coloured with a golden centre and a small ring of brown surrounded by another colour.

The plant is native to southern Africa. It is present in California and Australia as an introduced species after having escaped from garden cultivation.

<text>Here Comes Mr. Jordan is a 1941 American fantasy romantic comedy film directed by Alexander Hall, in which a boxer, mistakenly taken to Heaven before his time, is given a second chance back on Earth. It stars Robert Montgomery, Claude Rains, Evelyn Keyes, James Gleason, Edward Everett Horton, Rita Johnson, and John Emery.

The film screenplay, based on Harry Segall&#x27;s 1938 play &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; (originally titled &quot;It Was Like This&quot;), was written by Sidney Buchman and Seton I. Miller. The working titles for the film were &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; and &quot;Mr. Jordan Comes to Town&quot;.

Horton and Gleason reprised their roles in the film&#x27;s sequel &quot;Down to Earth&quot; (1947), while Roland Culver took on the role of Mr. Jordan. Warren Beatty later remade the film in 1978 as &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;. The 2001 film &quot;Down to Earth&quot;, starring Chris Rock, is also based on the play. The 1943 film, &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;, itself also a Best Picture Oscar nominee, has no connection to the source material for &quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan&quot;.

==Plot==
On May 11, 1941, boxer and amateur pilot Joe Pendleton, affectionately known as &quot;the Flying Pug&quot;, flies his small aircraft to his next fight in New York City, but crashes when a control cable severs. His soul is retrieved by 7013, an officious angel who assumed that Joe could not have survived. Joe&#x27;s manager, Max &quot;Pop&quot; Corkle, has his body cremated. In the afterlife, the records show his death was a mistake; he was supposed to live for 50 more years. The angel&#x27;s superior, Mr. Jordan, confirms this, but since there is no more body, Joe will have to take over a newly dead corpse. Jordan explains that a body is just something that is worn, like an overcoat; inside, Joe will still be himself. Joe insists that it be someone in good physical shape, because he wants to continue his boxing career.

After Joe turns down several &quot;candidates&quot;, Jordan takes him to see the body of a crooked, extremely wealthy banker and investor named Bruce Farnsworth, who has just been drugged and drowned in a bathtub by his wife Julia and his secretary, Tony Abbott. Joe is reluctant to take over a life so unlike his previous one, but when he sees the murderous pair mockingly berating Bette Logan, whose father&#x27;s name has been misused by Farnsworth to sell worthless securities, he changes his mind and agrees to take over Farnsworth&#x27;s body.

As Farnsworth, Joe repays all the investors and has Bette&#x27;s father exonerated. He sends for Corkle and convinces him that he is Joe (by playing his saxophone just as badly as he did in his previous incarnation). With Farnsworth&#x27;s money to smooth the way, Corkle trains him and arranges a bout to decide who will next fight the current heavyweight champion, but Jordan returns to warn Joe that, while he is destined to be the champion, it cannot happen that way. Joe has just enough time to tell Bette, with whom he has fallen in love, that if a stranger (especially if he is a boxer) approaches her, to give him a chance. Then he is shot by Tony. While Joe returns to a ghostly existence, Farnsworth&#x27;s body is hidden, with everyone believing Farnsworth has simply disappeared. Corkle hires a private investigator to find him.

Accompanied by Jordan, Joe goes to retrieve his lucky saxophone he left on Farnsworth&#x27;s piano and finds the police conducting a group interrogation. Corkle, talking to himself, wanders the room looking for Joe or Jordan. Corkle has explained about Joe, Mr. Jordan and the body-switching, to the police detective who thinks he is a nut. Joe manages to mentally nudge Corkle into turning on the radio to hear the championship fight and hears that Murdock has collapsed from a slight grazing punch. Jordan reveals that the boxer was shot by gamblers because he refused to throw the fight. Joe takes over Murdock&#x27;s body and wins the title. Back at the mansion, Corkle hears one of the radio announcers mention a saxophone hanging by the ringside and seeing the saxophone gone from the room, realizes Joe has assumed Murdock&#x27;s body.

Corkle races down to the dressing room. There, Joe passes along information from Jordan that Farnsworth&#x27;s body is in a refrigerator in the basement of the mansion. Corkle tells the detective, who promptly has Julia and Tony arrested. As Murdock, Joe fires his old, crooked manager and hires Corkle. Jordan reveals to Joe that this is his destiny; he can be Murdock and live his life.

Healing the gunshot wound and at the same time removing Joe&#x27;s memory of his past life, Jordan hangs around for a bit longer until Bette arrives. She wanted to see Corkle, but runs into Murdock instead. The pair feel they have met before. The two go off together, while Jordan smiles and says &quot;So long, champ.&quot;

==Cast==
==Production==

Columbia Pictures president Harry Cohn was persuaded to try a somewhat &quot;risky&quot; project in &quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan&quot;, despite his well-founded policy of building on past successful ventures, rather than financing more adventurous films. An original 1938 stage play, &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; by Harry Segall, was adapted to form the basis of the film. Broadway producer Jed Harris had planned to produce the play on the New York stage, until Columbia purchased the rights as a vehicle for Cary Grant. While it was still in pre-production, Montgomery was borrowed from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to star in the film.

Principal photography began on April 21, 1941, and ran until June 5 of that year. Location shooting took place at Providencia Ranch, California, and on Universal City sound stages.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Upon &quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan&quot; world premiere at Radio City Music Hall, film critic Theodore Strauss of &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted, &quot;Columbia has assembled its brightest people for a delightful and totally disarming joke at heaven&#x27;s expense.&quot; He further described the film as &quot;gay, witty, tender and not a little wise. It is also one of the choicest comic fantasies of the year.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; called Montgomery&#x27;s acting &quot;a highlight in a group of excellent performances&quot; and praised Hall&#x27;s direction for &quot;expert handling of characters and wringing utmost interest out of every scene.&quot;

&quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; wrote, &quot;Here is a picture that is praiseworthy from many angles; for one thing, the theme is novel and the plot developments ingenious; for another, the production values are good, and the acting and direction are of a high standard.&quot;

The review in &quot;The Film Daily&quot; opined, &quot;Producer Everett Riskin, noted for his successes in the field of comedy, had no cinch with this property which might easily have backfired with an inexperienced hand at the helm. But Riskin&#x27;s talent and knowledge has placed this finished product very near the peak of perfection in film making.&quot; &quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan&quot; placed fifth on the year-end poll of 548 critics nationwide at &quot;The Film Daily&quot;, naming it one of the best films of 1941.

Russell Maloney of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called the film &quot;one of the brightest comedies of the year ... Mr. Rains&#x27; acting is the kind that makes the word &#x27;ham&#x27; a word of endearment, and I mean that for a compliment.&quot;

The film&#x27;s premise of a protagonist receiving a second chance through the intervention of angels inspired other films throughout the ensuing decade, including &quot;I Married an Angel&quot; (1942), &quot;A Guy Named Joe&quot; (1943), and &quot;Angels in the Outfield&quot; (1951).

Film critic Leonard Maltin noted that &quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan&quot; was an &quot;Excellent fantasy-comedy of prizefighter Montgomery accidentally sent to heaven before his time, forced to occupy a new body on earth. Hollywood moviemaking at its best, with first-rate cast and performances.&quot;

===Accolades===
Harry Segall won the Academy Award for Best Story, while Sidney Buchman and Seton I. Miller won for Best Screenplay. Nominations included: Best Picture, Montgomery for Best Actor in a Leading Role, Hall for Best Director, Gleason for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and Joseph Walker for Best Cinematography, Black-and-White.

&quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan&quot; was preserved by the UCLA Film and Television Archive with the cooperation of Columbia Pictures and the Library of Congress.

===Home media===
&quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan&quot; was originally going to be released on VHS and Betamax in November 1979 as one of Columbia Pictures Home Entertainment&#x27;s launch titles, but because of the financial success of &quot;Midnight Express&quot;, the release was cancelled and &quot;Midnight Express&quot; took &quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan&quot; place in the launch lineup. Due to this, Columbia did not release the film on home video until 1982.

On June 14, 2016, The Criterion Collection released a fully restored version of the film on DVD and Blu-ray.

==Remakes==
On January 26, 1942, Claude Rains, Evelyn Keyes, and James Gleason reprised their roles in a &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; broadcast with Cary Grant, the original choice for the lead role, co-starring. A made-for-television adaptation was aired as an episode of &quot;The DuPont Show of the Month&quot; as &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; in 1960 starring Tony Franciosa as Joe Pendleton and Robert Morley as Mr. Jordan. &quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan&quot; was remade as &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; (1978), starring Warren Beatty, Buck Henry, and Julie Christie. &quot;Ice Angel&quot;, a 2000 film for Fox Family starring Nicolle Tom and Tara Lipinski remade it with the &quot;twist&quot; that it was an adult male hockey player who was forced to take over the body of a teenaged female figure skater. &quot;Down to Earth&quot; (2001), sharing the title with the sequel to &quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan&quot;, starred Chris Rock. An Indian Hindi remake of &quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan&quot; titled &quot;Jhuk Gaya Aasman&quot; was released in 1968. The Punjabi film &quot;Mar Gaye Oye Loko&quot; is also inspired by &quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan&quot;. A pornographic remake, &quot;Debbie Does Dallas ... Again&quot; (which reimagines the person taken too soon as the lead character from &quot;Debbie Does Dallas&quot;), was released in 2007.

==In other media==
In &quot;Road to Morocco&quot; (1942), one of Bob Hope&#x27;s characters, the deceased Aunt Lucy, comes to him in a dream but then cuts it short, saying &quot;Here comes Mr. Jordan&quot;, a homage to the film of the same name.

<doc id="77600" wikidata="Q366205" url="?curid=77600" title="Ofonius Tigellinus">
<text>Ofonius Tigellinus ( – 69) was a prefect of the Roman imperial bodyguard, known as the Praetorian Guard, from 62 until 68, during the reign of emperor Nero. Tigellinus gained imperial favour through his acquaintance with Nero&#x27;s mother Agrippina the Younger, and was appointed prefect upon the death of his predecessor Sextus Afranius Burrus, a position Tigellinus held first with Faenius Rufus and then Nymphidius Sabinus.

As a friend of Nero he quickly gained a reputation around Rome for cruelty and callousness. During the second half of the 60s, however, the emperor became increasingly unpopular with the people and the army, leading to several rebellions which ultimately led to his downfall and suicide in 68. When Nero&#x27;s demise appeared imminent, Tigellinus deserted him and shifted his allegiance to the new emperor Galba. Unfortunately for Tigellinus, Galba was replaced by Otho barely six months after his accession. Otho ordered the execution of Tigellinus, upon which he committed suicide.

== Life ==
Gaius Ofonius Tigellinus, born in about 10 AD, was of humble origin. His family, of Greek (or perhaps Spanish) descent, were natives of Agrigentum in Sicily. His father allegedly lived as an exile in Scyllaceum in Southern Italy, and Tigellinus may have been born there. In his twenties, he was living in Rome and was in contact with the Imperial Family. In 39, during the reign of Caligula, he was banished from the city. He had been accused of adultery with Agrippina the Younger and Julia Livilla, Caligula&#x27;s two surviving sisters. His exile was ended by the new emperor, Claudius, in 41, but he was forbidden to enter the Imperial Palace.

Tigellinus was said by the Roman historian Tacitus to have had an immoral youth and a vicious old age. As an adult, he first worked as a merchant in Greece. Later, he inherited a fortune, bought land in Apulia and Calabria on the Italian mainland and devoted himself to breeding racehorses. It was through this profession that he eventually gained the acquaintance and favor of Nero, whom he aided and abetted in his vices and cruelties. Settling in Rome in about 60, he became Urban Prefect of the three Urban Cohorts, the city&#x27;s paramilitary police force. On the death of Sextus Afranius Burrus in 62, Tigellinus succeeded him as Prefect of the Praetorian Guard. He persecuted his successive co-prefects, Faenius Rufus and Nymphidius Sabinus, to secure his position as one of Nero&#x27;s closest and most trusted advisors. He also fabricated evidence to justify the murder of Nero&#x27;s first wife, Claudia Octavia. In 64, he made himself notorious for the orgies that he arranged in the Basin of Agrippa.

In July of 64, he was suspected of incendiarism in connection with the Great Fire of Rome. After the fire had initially subsided it broke out again in Tigellinus&#x27; estate in the Amaelian district of the city. This led to the claim by Tacitus that Tigellinus was an arsonist.

In 65, during the investigation into the abortive conspiracy of Gaius Calpurnius Piso, he and Nero&#x27;s second wife, Poppaea Sabina, formed a kind of imperial privy council, falsely accusing the courtier and novelist Petronius Arbiter of treason. Under house-arrest in the coastal resort of Cumae, Petronius did not wait for a sentence of execution to be passed. Instead, he chose to commit suicide by repeatedly slitting and rebinding his wrists—apparently over a period of several days, during which he entertained his friends—until he finally chose to be fatally drained of blood.

In 67 Tigellinus accompanied Nero on his tour of Greece. He had a role in the death of the famous General Corbulo, who had also been invited to come to Greece but was ordered to commit suicide.

In 68, when Nero&#x27;s downfall appeared imminent, Tigellinus deserted him, supposedly suffering from &#x27;incurable bodily diseases&#x27;. (He possibly had cancer.) With his co-prefect Nymphidius Sabinus, he brought about the defection of the Praetorian Guard. Nymphidius then ordered him to surrender his command. Under the new emperor, Galba, he managed to save his life by lavishing presents upon Titus Vinius, the favourite of Galba, and his widowed daughter, whose life Tigellinus had once saved.

The next emperor, Otho, upon his accession in January 69, was determined to remove someone who was so intensely hated by the people. At his country estate near the coastal spa city of Sinuessa, Tigellinus was given the imperial order to return to Rome. Knowing that he would be facing death, he attempted to save his life by resorting to bribery - he had vessels anchored in the bay for such an eventuality. When that failed, he gave the bribe money as a gift to Otho&#x27;s messenger and was allowed to hold a farewell party. Afterwards, on the pretext that he needed to shave before leaving, he committed suicide by cutting his own throat with a razor.

== Tigellinus in later art ==

<text>The scout rifle is a conceptual class of general-purpose rifles defined and promoted by Jeff Cooper in the early 1980s that bears similarities in the design and functionality of guide guns, mountain rifles, and other rifle archetypes, but with more emphasis being placed on comfortable portability and practical accuracy, rather than firepower and long range shooting.

Scout rifles are typically bolt-action carbines chambered for .308 Winchester/7.62×51mm, with an overall length of no more than , with a barrel of or shorter, and less than in weight, with both iron and optical sights and fitted with practical slings (such as Ching slings) for shooting and carrying, and capable of reliably hitting man-sized targets out to without telescopic sights. Typically they employ forward-mounted, low-power long-eye relief (LER) scopes or iron sights to afford easy access to the top of the rifle action for rapid manual reloading. Cooper was personally involved with the design work on the Steyr Scout, while other gun manufacturers including Ruger and Savage have since also designed rifles that roughly match Cooper&#x27;s specifications.

Cooper realized that rifles in the late 20th century differed little from those used by celebrated scouts such as Maj. Frederick Russell Burnham one hundred years before, and that advances in metallurgy, optics, and plastics could make the rifle a handy, light instrument &quot;that will do a great many things equally well...&quot;. Cooper&#x27;s scout-rifle concept was largely influenced by the exploits of the scout Burnham in the Western United States and Africa and as such it is best suited to a man operating either alone or in a two or three man team.

&quot;The general-purpose rifle will do equally well for all but specialized hunting, as well as for fighting; thus it must be powerful enough to kill any living target of reasonable size. If you insist upon a definition of &#x27;reasonable size&#x27;, let us introduce an arbitrary mass figure of about .&quot;

In 1983 a conference was convened at the Cooper&#x27;s Gunsite Training Center in Arizona to examine the subject of the modernization of rifle design. The members of the conference included gunsmiths, stocksmiths, journalists, marksmanship instructors, inventors and hunters. It was called the &#x27;First Scout Rifle Conference&#x27;. A second conference was held in October 1984.

==Defining characteristics==
Drawing inspiration from several sources, specifically the 1903 Mannlicher–Schönauer and the Winchester Model 1894 carbines, Cooper defined several distinguishing characteristics of a scout rifle:

* Caliber: a standard chambering of .308 Winchester/7.62×51mm NATO or 7mm-08 Remington for locales that forbid civilian ownership of cartridges in chamberings adopted by military forces or for its &quot;slightly better ballistics.&quot; As Cooper wrote, &quot;A true Scout comes in .308 or 7mm-08.&quot; The .243 Winchester is an alternative for young, small-framed, or recoil-shy people, but needs a barrel. Cooper also commissioned &quot;Lion Scout,&quot; chambered for the .350 Remington Magnum cartridge.
* Action: all Cooper&#x27;s prototype scout rifles were bolt-actions, however he said &quot;if a semi-automatic action were made which was sufficiently compact and otherwise acceptable, it should certainly be considered&quot;. Cooper said the Brno ZKK 601 action is the closest to the guidelines. A bolt-action two-lug, 90° rotation was favored, as was the traditional Mauser claw extractor. The bolt knob should be smooth and round, not checkered and positioned far enough forward of the trigger to avoid pounding of the index finger during firing. The safety should be positive and include three positions. It should disconnect the trigger mechanism rather than blocking it. It should be strong and positive and work from front to rear, rear position &quot;safe&quot; and forward &quot;fire.&quot;
* Trigger: smooth and clean, and provide a crisp release.
* Weight: an unloaded weight, with accessories, of ; with as the maximum acceptable.
* Length: an overall length of or less and a barrel length of or less. These two characteristics place scout rifles into the general class of carbines.
* Optics: a forward-mounted telescopic sight of low magnification, typically 2 to 3 power. This preserves the shooter&#x27;s peripheral vision, keeps the ejection port open to allow the use of stripper clips to reload the rifle, and eliminates any chance of the scope striking one&#x27;s brow during recoil. Cooper has stated that a telescopic sight is not mandatory.
* Reserve sights: ghost ring auxiliary iron sights: a rear sight consisting of a receiver-mounted large-aperture thin ring, and typically a square post front sight on the receiver bridge and not on the end of the barrel, where it catches on things, breaks, snags and muddies up. This allows the rifle to be accurately aimed at short to medium ranges even if the scope becomes damaged.
* Stock: synthetic rather than wood stocks. Heel of the butt rounded to avoid snagging on the shirt. A spare magazine stored in the butt. A retractable bipod that does not protrude from the stock.
* Magazine: magazine should be so constructed as to protect the points of soft point spitzer bullets as they ride in the magazine. Some sort of magazine cut-off permitting the rifle to be used in the single-shot mode with the magazine in reserve. An alternative to the magazine cut-off is a detachable box magazine with a double detent which could be inserted to its first stop not allowing the bolt to feed it. When desired, the magazine could be pressed into its second stop, permitting the bolt to pick up the top cartridge.
* Sling: a &quot;Ching&quot; or &quot;CW&quot; sling. Against common practice, Cooper advocated the use of a sling as a shooting aid. The Ching sling offers the convenience of a carrying strap and the steadiness of a target shooter&#x27;s sling with the speed of a biathlete&#x27;s sling. (The CW sling is a simpler version of a Ching sling, consisting of a single strap.)
* Accuracy: should be capable of shooting into 2 MOA (0.6 mrad) or at (3 shot groups)

These features dictated short, thin barrels, synthetic stocks, and bolt actions. Other optional features included a retractable bipod, detachable magazines, a buttstock ammunition or magazine holding pouch, and an accessory rail for mounting a flashlight, laser sight, among other attachments. The addition of some of these features often renders the rifle technically not a scout as originally defined, but this has come to be accepted by many as still conforming to the spirit if not to the letter of the concept.

==Shooting and use==
Although it is unusual in appearance and design when compared to traditional rifles, the features which set the scout rifle apart were selected for utility rather than appearance. The scope sight is mounted on the barrel both for stability, and some claim it also allows faster acquisition of the sighting line when the rifle is brought to the shoulder. It also keeps the breech and ejection port of the weapon clear of obstruction, allowing rapid top-loading of cartridges and clearance of jams or other obstructions.

Being slightly shorter than most full-caliber rifles increases the muzzle blast from a scout rifle, and being lightweight increases the felt recoil (to a significant level in the Steyr Dragoon Scout due to its .376 Steyr cartridge). Even the recoil of the .308 Winchester in a scout was described as feeling like a .300 Winchester Magnum by &quot;Gun Tests&quot;.

Should the scope be damaged, it can be rapidly removed and the ghost ring sight used.

==Commercial variants==
For many years scout rifles were only available from custom gunsmiths. However, a number of manufacturers build scout rifles close to Cooper&#x27;s specifications.

===Steyr Scout===

The version considered by some to be the benchmark is the Steyr Scout.

In 1998, Steyr–Mannlicher of Austria began series production of the Steyr Scout, which is also known as the Mannlicher Scout. Jeff Cooper spent many years of reflection and working with Steyr before they began production built to the specifications developed. A heavy-caliber version is chambered for the proprietary .376 Steyr cartridge, but exceeds (by approximately one inch) the overall length limit of the scout rifle specification. This version carries four rounds in the magazine, compared to five in the standard Steyr Scout. A version is also produced in the 5.56×45mm/.223 Remington round used in various current military carbines.

The Steyr Scout features an integral bipod, as well as storage for a spare, loaded magazine. The rifle is also designed to allow either single-shot, manually loaded fire or normal magazine feeding.

In January, 2015, Steyr Arms announced that a limited edition Steyr Camo Scout would be available in three variations of hydro-dipped camouflage due to customer demand.

===Savage Scout===
Savage Arms offered the Model 10FCM Scout with their adjustable AccuTrigger (allowing the owner to safely adjust trigger pull weight to anywhere between without the need of a gunsmith), black synthetic AccuStock with aluminum spine and three-dimensional bedding cradle, a free-floating button-rifled barrel, oversized bolt knob for rapid manipulation of the bolt, ghost ring rear sight, forward scope mount, and detachable 4-round box magazine in either .308 Winchester or 7.62×39mm with a total weight of and an overall length of . It was discontinued in 2014. Savage re-introduced their Scout as the 11 Scout in 2015 and improved it by adding a 3rd sling swivel, butt spacers and an adjustable cheek-piece to a &quot;natural&quot; colored stock.

For 2018, the rifle was again refreshed to incorporate the &quot;Accu-Fit&quot; system as well as abandoning the proprietary magazine of the earlier models in favor of an Accuracy International AICS magazine, which provides greater compatibility across brands.

===Ruger Frontier===

Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co. offered several M77 Mark II Frontier rifles in stainless steel in various chamberings from varmint to heavy game all featuring a non-rotating, Mauser-type controlled-feed extractor and a fixed blade-type ejector.

In a review of a 7mm-08 Frontier Model 77, John Taffin, wrote, &quot;If it is possible to love an inanimate object such as a rifle, I am definitely in love. This Model 77 Mk II Frontier is everything I had been looking for in a lightweight, compact, easy-to-carry 7-08mm bolt-action rifle and more.&quot;

===Ruger Gunsite Scout===
In 2011, Ruger introduced the Ruger Gunsite Scout, a re-designed scout rifle based on their Model 77 action and developed with Gunsite Training Center. The new rifle debuted at the 2011 SHOT show bearing the adopted name &quot;Gunsite Scout Rifle&quot; mounted on the grip cap. The rifle features a matte black receiver, a cold-hammer forged alloy steel barrel, a forward mounted picatinny rail, a 3, 5 or 10-round detachable box magazine, a flash suppressor, an adjustable ghost-ring rear iron sight, a polymer trigger guard, and a black laminate wood stock with length-of-pull spacers. The rifle is chambered in .308 caliber and weighs .

===Mossberg MVP Scout===
At the 2015 SHOT Show, O.F. Mossberg &amp; Sons introduced a scout rifle based on their MVP platform. The Mossberg MVP Scout was originally offered in both 5.56×45mm and .308 Winchester chamberings (though by 2020, the 5.56mm variant was no longer listed on Mossberg&#x27;s website). The MVP platform is notable for being designed to feed from either AR-15-compatible STANAG magazines (in the 5.56mm variant) or AR-10- and M1A/M14-compatible magazines (in the .308 variant). The MVP Scout features a synthetic matte black receiver, a medium threaded bull barrel that comes stock with an A2-style flash hider, an extended Picatinny rail as well as a ghost-ring rear sight and fiber-optic front sight. The .308 caliber MVP Scout weights .

===Howa Scout Rifle===

Scout variant of Howa Model 1500. Comes with threaded barrel and available in .308 Winchester only.

<text>Hold Back the Dawn is a 1941 American romantic drama film directed by Mitchell Leisen, in which a Romanian gigolo marries an American woman in Mexico in order to gain entry to the United States, but winds up falling in love with her. It stars Charles Boyer, Olivia de Havilland, Paulette Goddard, Victor Francen, Walter Abel, Curt Bois, Rosemary DeCamp, and an uncredited Veronica Lake.

The movie was adapted by Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder from the 1940 novel by Ketti Frings.

It was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actress in a Leading Role (Olivia de Havilland), Best Writing, Screenplay, Best Art Direction-Interior Decoration, Black-and-White, Best Cinematography, Black-and-White, and Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic Picture.

==Plot==
The story opens with Georges Iscovescu recounting his story to a Hollywood film director at Paramount in an effort to earn some quick cash. Georges is a Romanian-born gigolo who has arrived in a Mexican border town seeking entry to the US. He has to endure a waiting period of up to eight years in order to obtain a quota number, living with other hopeful immigrants in the Esperanza Hotel. After six months he is broke and unhappy. When he runs into his former dancing partner, Anita Dixon, she explains how she quickly obtained US citizenship by marrying an American, who she then, just as quickly, divorced.

Georges resolves on the same plan. He soon targets visiting school teacher Miss Emmy Brown who is in Mexico on a day trip with her class of about fifteen young boys. Georges manages to extend the time necessary to repair her broken-down automobile. Emmy and her pupils sleep in the lobby of the full-up Esperanza Hotel. This provides Georges the opportunity to quickly and intensively woo Emmy in the early morning hours; she awakens to him sitting nearby and gazing at her lovingly. By claiming she is the exact image of the lost love of his life, his seemingly intense ardor toward a stranger is plausible, and they marry later that same day. However, Georges must wait some weeks before entering the US, and Emmy returns home with the boys.

A few days later, Emmy unexpectedly returns, complicating Georges&#x27; plans. Immigration inspector Hammock also appears, hunting for con artists such as Georges, and necessitating Georges&#x27; and an unwitting Emmy&#x27;s departure. He drives all night, arriving at dawn in a small village. They participate in a festival of traditional blessings for newlyweds, an event that Emmy assumes has been Georges&#x27; destination all along. Georges had not planned on consummating the marriage, believing that he could return her to her small town essentially unchanged by the marriage, and fakes a shoulder injury. However, as the trip continues, he is surprised and increasingly enchanted by Emmy. When they stop at the seaside, Emmy bathes in the cool green water and Georges is unable to resist making love to her.

However, this jeopardizes Anita&#x27;s plan for her and Georges to meet in New York and work together, to which he had agreed. Anita has long been in love with Georges, and on their return, brutally informs Emmy of the entire scheme reciting the inscription on Emmy&#x27;s wedding ring, which Georges&#x27; said was his mother&#x27;s. Hammock then asks Emmy to verify the legitimacy of her marriage; she does not turn him in, partially blaming her own naiveté, but nevertheless leaves him. Returning to the US, she drives distractedly, in anguish at Georges&#x27; betrayal. When a black lace veil Georges had bought her is blown into her face, she is seriously injured in a car accident.

When Georges learns of this, he immediately crosses the border, jeopardizing his visa to go to her. On hearing his voice, she awakens; seeing him, her misery is relieved and her breathing and heartbeat normalize as he sits with her for hours. However, Hammock is still on his tail, and, when Georges sees police arriving, he takes off. He heads to Paramount to try to sell his story to director Dwight Saxon, in order to get the money for Emmy&#x27;s care. Hammock catches up with him and returns him to Mexico.

Some weeks later, Hammock returns to the border town. Anita has a new sugar daddy. Georges has unsurprisingly not heard from Emmy, and believes the worst, sitting dejectedly on a bench writing notes in the sand. Hammock joins him, and tells Georges that he didn&#x27;t report the illegal entry – Georges&#x27; visa has been approved. Georges looks up to see Emmy, in a beautiful hat, happily waving to him in the sun from across the border. He crosses, and they depart.

==Reception==
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 100 percent based on 7 critics, with an average rating of 8.40 out of 10.

&quot;Variety&quot; commented that &quot;While &quot;Hold Back the Dawn&quot; is basically another European refugee yarn, scenarists Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder exercised some ingenuity and imagination and Ketti Frings&#x27; original emerges as fine celluloidia&quot;.

Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;You will enjoy it as a straight-away romance, crowded with most engaging characters and smoking with Mr. Boyer&#x27;s charm&quot;.

<doc id="77605" wikidata="Q963435" url="?curid=77605" title="One Foot in Heaven">
<text>One Foot in Heaven is a 1941 American biographical drama film directed by Irving Rapper and starring Fredric March, Martha Scott, Beulah Bondi, Gene Lockhart and Elisabeth Fraser. The film was adapted by Casey Robinson from the autobiography by Hartzell Spence. It was produced and distributed by Warner Brothers. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.

==Plot==
In Stratford, Ontario, in 1904, William Spence (Fredric March), a medical student on the verge of becoming a doctor, receives &quot;The Call&quot; while passing a Methodist church one Sunday. His bride-to-be, Hope Morris (Martha Scott), accepts his decision to enter the ministry with a whole heart despite the disappointment of her prominent and affluent parents.

Will &quot;dives right in,&quot; but, with no vacancies in Canada, is posted as a circuit minister to a small town in rural Iowa, beginning a life for them of frequent moves around the district, dingy parsonages, and scraping a living from poor boxes and performing weddings. Hope yearns for a decent parsonage and a sense of permanence for their children, but uncomplainingly provides them a good life and a supportive home for Will.

For his part, Will understands his own nature and laughs at his own foibles, bending where he can in good conscience. He often enters situations in anger or to instruct but leaves humbled and renewed in spirit. While Will sincerely lives by and teaches by example (which includes his family) the tenets of the Methodist &quot;Discipline&quot;, he also learns from his congregations to be flexible and change with the times.
When their third child, a boy, is born, Hope and Will cannot agree on a name and he remains unbaptized for three months. Hope wants to name the baby William Spence Jr., but Will does not like the idea of his son going without a middle name as he did. He wants the boy to have and be called in &quot;the good old Canadian custom&quot; by the middle name of Frazer. Will seems to give in to Hope but the following Sunday baptizes him William Frazer Spence. Hope serenely accepts the change.

Oldest son Hartzell (named for Will&#x27;s guiding bishop) has a hard time coping with the idea that a minister&#x27;s son should be an example to the other boys. Will explains that &quot;a pastor&#x27;s family walks a tightrope, balancing with one foot on earth and one foot already in Heaven.&quot; After learning that Hartzell has been sneaking into the movies, a pastime seemingly forbidden by the &quot;Discipline&quot;, Will takes him to the theater to point out why the film is bad for him. They see a western but rather than finding it sinful, Will is impressed by its moral. The following Sunday he preaches a sermon advising his congregation that young people may have something to teach their elders.

In the 1920s, the family is assigned to a church in Denver, Colorado, that, despite having many well-heeled members, is old, uncomfortable and decrepit. In a time of economic prosperity for the country, the Spences cope with possibly their most dilapidated parsonage yet. Will has come to appreciate his wife&#x27;s serenity with life and resolves to provide her a decent parsonage by building a new church.

His plans at first are thwarted by power struggles among several snobbish members of the church. He loses one wealthy patron, Mrs. Sandow (Beulah Bondi), to the Baptists when he refuses to stop ministering to her chauffeur (Harry Davenport), and another, influential banker Preston Thurston (Gene Lockhart), after organizing a children&#x27;s choir to replace the off-key church choir, run for years by Mrs. Thurston (Laura Hope Crews), her family and social circle. Soon after, Hartzell (Frankie Thomas) is expelled from school because of a gossip campaign falsely accusing him of making a young girl pregnant and forcing her family to move to San Francisco.

A deeply discouraged Will investigates a job offer in California that offers the beautiful church and parsonage he and Hope have always dreamed of but discovers that he cannot surrender in his struggles with the Thurstons. He seeks out the girl&#x27;s family and learns that there is no truth to any part of the rumor. Returning to Denver, Will confronts Mrs. Thurston and her circle, who started the rumors to punish Will, and suggests that if they don&#x27;t contribute substantially to the building of the new church, he will call them out in his sermons.

A repentant Mrs. Sandow begs to return to the church and Will inveigles from her the stained glass window, new Skinner organ, and carillon that as luxuries are being cut from the plans to finance a recreation center for the church. A year later, their dream church and parsonage finished, Will accepts the challenge of returning to Iowa to aid a small church in trouble, confident that he leaves behind a revitalized church when its members, including all those with whom he locked horns, gather spontaneously on a weekday morning to sing &quot;The Church&#x27;s One Foundation&quot; as he plays it on the new carillon.

==Reception==
The film was received quite warmly both theatrically and critically, the &quot;New York Times&quot; calling it &quot;a Fine and Human Story of a Minister&#x27;s Life&quot;.

==Radio adaptation==
On April 20, 1942, &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; presented a 45-minute adaptation of &quot;One Foot in Heaven&quot;, with Fredric March and Martha Scott reprising their original roles. This program was fifteen minutes shorter than the usual 60 minutes in order to make room for a 15-minute government broadcast explaining upcoming World War II-related price controls. A second &quot;Lux&quot; radio adaptation of &quot;One Foot in Heaven&quot;, this time airing for a full hour on the summer series &quot;Lux Summer Theatre&quot;, aired on July 27, 1953, with Dana Andrews in the lead role.

==Notes==
Olivia de Havilland was originally scheduled for the role of Hope Spence, but was moved over to star opposite Errol Flynn in &quot;They Died with Their Boots On&quot;.

Raymond Massey was Hartzell Spence&#x27;s choice to play his father while his mother preferred Fredric March. The studio&#x27;s decision to cast March was made independently of the family&#x27;s wishes.

The Reverend Norman Vincent Peale was hired as a technical advisor on the film.

The film which Spence goes to see with Hartzell is William S. Hart&#x27;s 1917 Western &quot;The Silent Man&quot;. At the Hollywood premiere of the film, Hart was a guest of honor.

In an uncredited role, Gig Young made one of his earlier on-screen performances as a dog groomer seeking a license.

The book on which the movie is based takes place and ends well before 1939. However, the use of &quot;Methodist Church&quot; in the film is an impossibility because Methodist faith in America did not unify under the name &quot;Methodist Church&quot; until after the terms of reunification of the Methodist Episcopal Church, the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, and the Methodist Protestant Church were agreed upon and voted upon in Kansas City in 1939.

<doc id="77606" wikidata="Q134452" url="?curid=77606" title="Charles VIII of France">
<text>Charles VIII, called the Affable (; 30 June 1470 – 7 April 1498), was King of France from 1483 to his death in 1498. He succeeded his father Louis XI at the age of 13. His elder sister Anne acted as regent jointly with her husband Peter II, Duke of Bourbon until 1491, when the young king turned 21 years of age. During Anne&#x27;s regency, the great lords rebelled against royal centralisation efforts in a conflict known as the Mad War (1485–1488), which resulted in a victory for the royal government.

In a remarkable stroke of audacity, Charles married Anne of Brittany in 1491 after she had already been married by proxy to the Habsburg Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I in a ceremony of questionable validity. Preoccupied by the problematic succession in the Kingdom of Hungary, Maximilian failed to press his claim. Upon his marriage, Charles became administrator of Brittany and established a personal union that enabled France to avoid total encirclement by Habsburg territories.

To secure his rights to the Neapolitan throne that René of Anjou had left to his father, Charles made a series of concessions to neighbouring monarchs and, due to his revolutionary artillery, conquered the Italian Peninsula without much opposition. A coalition formed against the French invasion of 1494–1498 attempted to stop Charles&#x27; army at Fornovo, but failed and Charles marched his army back to France.

Charles died in 1498 after supposedly striking his head accidentally on the lintel of a door at the Château d&#x27;Amboise, his place of birth, but that has been subject to re-analysis. Since he had no male heir, he was succeeded by his second cousin once removed and brother-in-law at the time, Louis XII, from the Orléans cadet branch of the House of Valois.

==Youth==
Charles was born at the Château d&#x27;Amboise in France, the only surviving son of King Louis XI by his second wife Charlotte of Savoy. His godparents were Charles II, Duke of Bourbon (the godchild&#x27;s namesake), Joan of Valois, Duchess of Bourbon, and the teenage Edward of Westminster, the son of Henry VI of England who had been living in France since the deposition of his father by Edward IV. Charles succeeded to the throne on 30 August 1483 at the age of 13. His health was poor. He was regarded by his contemporaries as possessing a pleasant disposition, but also as foolish and unsuited for the business of the state. In accordance with the wishes of Louis XI, the regency of the kingdom was granted to Charles&#x27; elder sister Anne, a formidably intelligent and shrewd woman described by her father as &quot;the least foolish woman in France&quot;. She ruled as regent, together with her husband Peter of Bourbon, until 1491.

==Marriage==
Charles was betrothed on 22 July 1483 to the 3-year-old Margaret of Austria, daughter of the Archduke Maximilian of Austria (later Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I) and Mary, Duchess of Burgundy. The marriage was arranged by Louis XI, Maximilian, and the Estates of the Low Countries as part of the 1482 Peace of Arras between France and the Duchy of Burgundy. Margaret brought the counties of Artois and Franche-Comté to France as her dowry, and she was raised in the French court as a prospective queen.

In 1488, however, Francis II, Duke of Brittany, died in a riding accident, leaving his 11-year-old daughter Anne as his heir. Anne, who feared for the independence of her duchy against the ambitions of France, arranged a marriage in 1490 between herself and the widower Maximilian. The regent Anne of France and her husband Peter refused to countenance such a marriage, however, since it would place Maximilian and his family, the Habsburgs, on two French borders. The French army invaded Brittany, taking advantage of the preoccupation of Maximilian and his father, Emperor Frederick III, with the disputed succession to Mathias Corvinus, King of Hungary. Anne of Brittany was forced to renounce Maximilian (whom she had only married by proxy) and agree to be married to Charles VIII instead.

In December 1491, in an elaborate ceremony at the Château de Langeais, Charles and Anne of Brittany were married. The 14-year-old Duchess Anne, not happy with the arranged marriage, arrived for her wedding with her entourage carrying two beds. However, Charles&#x27;s marriage brought him independence from his relatives and thereafter he managed affairs according to his own inclinations. Queen Anne lived at the Clos Lucé in Amboise.

There still remained the matter of Charles&#x27; first betrothed, the young Margaret of Austria. Although the cancellation of her betrothal meant that she by rights should have been returned to her family, Charles did not initially do so, intending to marry her usefully elsewhere in France. Eventually, in 1493, she was returned to her family, together with her dowry – though the Duchy of Burgundy was retained in the Treaty of Senlis.

Around the king there was a circle of court poets, the most memorable being the Italian humanist Publio Fausto Andrelini from Forlì, who spread Renaissance humanism in France. During a pilgrimage to pay respects to his father&#x27;s remains, Charles observed Mont Aiguille and ordered Antoine de Ville to ascend to the summit in an early technical alpine climb, later alluded to by Rabelais.

==Italian War==
To secure France against invasions, Charles made treaties with Maximilian I of Austria (the Treaty of Senlis with Maximilian of Austria on 19 January 1493), Ferdinand II of Aragon (The Treaty of Barcelona (1493)), and England (the Treaty of Étaples with England on 3 November 1492), buying their neutrality with large concessions. The English monarch Henry VII had forced Charles to abandon his support for the pretender Perkin Warbeck by despatching an expedition which laid siege to Boulogne. He devoted France&#x27;s resources to building up a large army, including one of Europe&#x27;s first siege trains with artillery.

In 1489, Pope Innocent VIII (1484–1492), then being at odds with Ferdinand I of Naples, offered Naples to Charles, who had a vague claim to the Kingdom of Naples through his paternal grandmother, Marie of Anjou. Innocent&#x27;s policy of meddling in the affairs of other Italian states was continued by his successor, Pope Alexander VI (1492–1503), when the latter supported a plan for a carving out a new state in central Italy. The new state would have impacted on Milan more than any of the other states involved. Consequently, in 1493, Ludovico Sforza, the Duke of Milan, appealed for help to Charles VIII. Charles then returned Perpignan to Ferdinand II of Aragon to free up forces for the invasion of Italy. The next year in 1494, Milan faced an additional threat. On 25 January 1494, Ferdinand I, King of Naples, died unexpectedly. His death made Alfonso II, king of Naples. Alfonso II laid claim to the Milanese duchy. Alfonso II now urged Charles to take Milan militarily. Charles was also urged on in this adventure by his favorite courtier, Étienne de Vesc. Thus, Charles came to imagine himself capable of actually taking Naples, and invaded Italy.

In an event that was to prove a watershed in Italian history, Charles invaded Italy with 25,000 men (including 8,000 Swiss mercenaries) in September 1494 and marched across the peninsula virtually unopposed, using gunpowder artillery powerful enough to rapidly reduce Italian fortifications not designed to endure it. He arrived in Pavia on 21 October 1494 and entered Pisa on 8 November 1494. The French army subdued Florence in passing on their way south. Reaching Naples on 22 February 1495, the French Army took Naples without a pitched battle or siege; Alfonso was expelled, and Charles was crowned King of Naples.

There were those in the Republic of Florence who appreciated the presence of the French king and his Army. The famous friar Savonarola believed that King Charles VIII was God&#x27;s tool to purify the corruption of Florence. He believed that once Charles had ousted the evil sinners of Florence, the city would become a center of morality. Thus, Florence was the appropriate place to restructure the Church. This situation would eventually spill over into another conflict between Pope Alexander VI, who despised the idea of having the king in northern Italy where the Pope feared the King of France would interfere with the Papal States, and Savonarola, who called for the king&#x27;s intervention. This conflict would eventually lead Savonarola to be suspected of heresy and to be executed by the State.

The speed and power of the French advance frightened the other Italian rulers, including the Pope and even Ludovico of Milan. They formed an anti-French coalition, the League of Venice on 31 March 1495. The formation of the League of Venice, which included the northern Italian states of Duchy of Milan, the Republic of Venice, the Duchy of Mantua, and the Republic of Florence in addition to the Kingdom of Spain, the Holy Roman Empire and the Kingdom of Naples, appeared to have trapped Charles in southern Italy and blocked his return to France. Charles would have to cross the territory of at least some of the League members to return home to France. At Fornovo in July 1495, the League was unable to stop Charles from marching his army out of Italy. The League lost 2,000 men to Charles&#x27; 1,000 and, although Charles lost nearly all the booty of the campaign, the League was unable to stop him from crossing their territory on his way back to France. Meanwhile, Charles&#x27; remaining garrisons in Naples were quickly subdued by Aragonese forces sent by Ferdinand II of Aragon, ally of Alfonso on 6–7 July 1495. Thus in the end, Charles VIII lost all the gains that he had made in Italy.

Over the next few years, Charles VIII tried to rebuild his army and resume the campaign, but he was hampered by the large debts incurred in 1494–95. He never succeeded in gaining anything substantive.

==Death==
Charles died in 1498, two and a half years after his retreat from Italy, as the result of an accident. While on his way to watch a game of &quot;jeu de paume&quot; (real tennis) in Amboise he struck his head on the lintel of a door. At around 2:00 p.m., while returning from the game, he fell into a sudden coma and died nine hours later. However, more recent analysis disputes this narrative of his death with a 2021 study concluding that such an injury would cause only minor trauma. That same study also hypothesized Charles actually died of severe brain injuries that could have been caused by an epileptic condition, itself a result of neurosyphilis.

Charles bequeathed a meagre legacy: he left France in debt and in disarray as a result of his ambition. However, his expedition did strengthen cultural ties to Italy, energizing French art and literature in the latter part of the Renaissance. Since his children predeceased him, Charles was the last of the elder branch of the House of Valois. Upon his death, the throne passed to his brother-in-law and second cousin once removed, Louis XII. Anne returned to Brittany and began taking steps to regain the independence of her duchy. In order to stymie these efforts, Louis XII had his 24-year childless marriage to Charles&#x27;s sister, Joan, annulled and married Anne.

==Issue==

Charles and Anne had:
* Charles Orland, Dauphin of France (11 October 1492 – 16 December 1495), died of the measles when three years old. Buried at Tours Cathedral.
* Francis (August 1493), was premature and stillborn. Buried at Notre-Dame de Cléry.
* Stillborn daughter (March 1495)
* Charles, Dauphin of France (8 September 1496 – 2 October 1496). Buried at Tours Cathedral.
* Francis, Dauphin of France (July 1497). He died several hours after his birth. Buried at Tours Cathedral.
* Anne of France (20 March 1498). She died on the day of her birth at Château de Plessis-lez-Tours. Buried at Tours Cathedral.

==Media==
The 1671 English play &quot;Charles VIII of France&quot; by John Crowne depicts his reign.

Charles VIII&#x27;s invasion of Italy and his relations with Pope Alexander VI are depicted in the novel &quot;The Sultan&#x27;s Helmsman&quot;.

In the 2011 Showtime series &quot;The Borgias&quot;, Charles VIII is portrayed by French actor Michel Muller.
In the 2011 French-German historical drama &quot;Borgia&quot;, Charles VIII is played by Simon Larvaron. The event of the king&#x27;s death is depicted in the TV series &quot;Borgia&quot; with a small twist: in the episode, Charles &quot;himself&quot; plays a game of jeu de paume with Cesare Borgia and loses; while &quot;leaving&quot; the game, Charles strikes his head on the lintel of a door.

The 2012 Spanish TV series Isabel also depicts the death of Charles VIII. In that series, Charles was played by the actor Héctor Carballo.

In the 2017 German-Austrian historical drama &quot;Maximilian&quot;, a young Charles when he was Dauphin is portrayed by French actor Max Baissette de Malglaive. Made available by American cable network Starz in 2018.

<text>Sergeant York is a 1941 American biographical film about the life of Alvin C. York, one of the most decorated American soldiers of World War I. Directed by Howard Hawks and starring Gary Cooper in the title role, the film was a critical and commercial success, and became the highest-grossing film of 1941. In 2008, &quot;Sergeant York&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

The film was based on York&#x27;s diary, as edited by Tom Skeyhill, and adapted by Harry Chandlee, Abem Finkel, John Huston, Howard E. Koch, and Sam Cowan (uncredited). York refused, several times, to authorize a film version of his life story, but finally yielded to persistent efforts to finance the creation of an interdenominational Bible school. The story that York insisted on Cooper for the title role comes from a telegram that producer Jesse L. Lasky wrote to Cooper pleading with him to accept the part, to which he signed York&#x27;s name.

Cooper went on to win the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance, while the film also won Best Film Editing and was nominated in nine other categories, including Best Picture, Director, Supporting Actor (Walter Brennan), and Supporting Actress (Margaret Wycherly). The American Film Institute ranked the film 57th in its 100 most inspirational American movies list; it also rated Alvin York 35th in its list of the top 50 heroes in American cinema.

==Plot==
Before America&#x27;s entry into World War I, Alvin York is a poor, young farmer in rural Tennessee, living with his widowed mother, sister, and younger brother. Alvin&#x27;s leisure time is spent fighting and getting drunk with friends. Alvin&#x27;s goal is to purchase a piece of farmland, fertile &quot;bottomland&quot;. Alvin works hard to acquire the price for the land, and is given an extension by the owner. Alvin&#x27;s sharpshooting skills enable him to raise the money needed, but the owner reneges, making Alvin angry and bitter. En route to seek revenge, Alvin and his mule are struck by lightning. The incident prompts Alvin to rejoin his church.

When the U.S. enters World War I, Alvin seeks exemption as a conscientious objector, which is denied. Alvin is torn between fighting for his country and the biblical prohibition against killing. His sympathetic commanding officer gives him leave to go home and come to a decision. Alvin reconciles his moral conflict after reading the biblical injunction to &quot;render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar&#x27;s, and unto God the things that are God&#x27;s.&quot;

During the Meuse–Argonne offensive, York&#x27;s qualms vanish when he sees his friends and comrades being killed as they assault a strong German position. With his superiors dead or incapacitated, he takes charge. He infiltrates the German lines by himself and finds a position that lets him enfilade the main German defensive trench. He kills so many German soldiers that they eventually surrender to him en masse. One of the prisoners of war treacherously grenades Alvin&#x27;s good friend, &quot;Pusher&quot; Ross, and is gunned down by York. He and the handful of survivors from his unit lead their many captives behind their lines, but have a hard time finding anyone to take the Germans off their hands. The officer who finally does is astonished to learn that so few men captured so many of the enemy.

York is decorated and hailed as a national hero, feted in Europe, New York, and Washington DC, but he desires to return home. He rejects commercial offers that would make him wealthy, explaining that he could not take money for doing his duty. York returns home to marry his fiancée, Gracie. To his surprise, the state has purchased the bottomland farm and built a house for Gracie and him.

==Reception==
&quot;Sergeant York&quot; was a success at the box office and became the highest-grossing film of 1941. This was influenced by the attack on Pearl Harbor, which occurred while the film was still playing in theaters. The film&#x27;s patriotic theme helped recruit soldiers; young men sometimes went directly from the movie theater to military enlistment offices. After its initial release, the film was frequently reshown at theaters all over America during the war as a quick replacement for box-office flops and as a theme program for bond sales and scrap drives.

According to Warner Bros. records, the film earned $6,075,000 domestically and $2,184,000 internationally.

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an 88% rating based on 24 reviews, with an average rating of 7.4/10.

==Accolades==

The film was nominated by the American Film Institute for its 2006 list of most inspiring movies.

<doc id="77610" wikidata="Q207370" url="?curid=77610" title="Gaius Cassius Longinus">
<text>Gaius Cassius Longinus (; – 3 October 42 BC) was a Roman senator and general best known as a leading instigator of the plot to assassinate Julius Caesar on 15 March 44 BC. He was the brother-in-law of Brutus, another leader of the conspiracy. He commanded troops with Brutus during the Battle of Philippi against the combined forces of Mark Antony and Octavian, Caesar&#x27;s former supporters, and committed suicide after being defeated by Mark Antony.

Cassius was elected as tribune of the plebs in 49 BC. He opposed Caesar, and eventually he commanded a fleet against him during Caesar&#x27;s Civil War: after Caesar defeated Pompey in the Battle of Pharsalus, Caesar overtook Cassius and forced him to surrender. After Caesar&#x27;s death, Cassius fled to the East, where he amassed an army of twelve legions. He was supported and made governor by the Senate. Later he and Brutus marched west against the allies of the Second Triumvirate.

He followed the teachings of the philosopher Epicurus, although scholars debate whether or not these beliefs affected his political life. Cassius is a main character in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; that depicts the assassination of Caesar and its aftermath. He is also shown in the lowest circle of Hell in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot; as punishment for betraying and killing Caesar.

==Biography==
===Early life===

Gaius Cassius Longinus came from a very old Roman family, gens Cassia, which had been prominent in Rome since the 6th century BC. Little is known of his early life, apart from a story that he showed his dislike of despots while still at school, by quarreling with the son of the dictator Sulla. He studied philosophy at Rhodes under Archelaus of Rhodes and became fluent in Greek. He was married to Junia Tertia, who was the daughter of Servilia and thus a half-sister of his co-conspirator Brutus. They had one son, who was born in about 60 BC.

===Carrhae and Syria===
In 54 BC, Cassius joined Marcus Licinius Crassus in his eastern campaign against the Parthian Empire. In 53 BC, Crassus suffered a decisive defeat at the Battle of Carrhae in Northern-Mesopotamia losing two-thirds of his army. Cassius led the remaining troops&#x27; retreat back into Syria, and organised an effective defence force for the province. Based on Plutarch&#x27;s account, the defeat at Carrhae could have been avoided had Crassus acted as Cassius had advised. According to Dio, the Roman soldiers, as well as Crassus himself, were willing to give the overall command to Cassius after the initial disaster in the battle, which Cassius &quot;very properly&quot; refused. The Parthians also considered Cassius as equal to Crassus in authority, and superior to him in skill.

In 51 BC, Cassius was able to ambush and defeat an invading Parthian army under the command of prince Pacorus and general Osaces. He first refused to do battle with the Parthians, keeping his army behind the walls of Antioch (Syria&#x27;s most important city) where he was besieged. When the Parthians gave up the siege and started to ravage the countryside, he followed them with his army harrying them as they went. The decisive encounter came on October 7 as the Parthians turned away from Antigonea. As they set about their return journey they were confronted by a detachment of Cassius&#x27; army, which faked a retreat and lured the Parthians into an ambush. The Parthians were suddenly surrounded by Cassius&#x27; main forces and defeated. Their general Osaces died from his wounds, and the rest of the Parthian army retreated back across the Euphrates.

===Civil war===
Cassius returned to Rome in 50 BC, when civil war was about to break out between Julius Caesar and Pompey. Cassius was elected tribune of the plebs for 49 BC, and threw in his lot with the Optimates, although his brother Lucius Cassius supported Caesar. Cassius left Italy shortly after Caesar crossed the Rubicon. He met Pompey in Greece, and was appointed to command part of his fleet.

In 48 BC, Cassius sailed his ships to Sicily, where he attacked and burned a large part of Caesar&#x27;s navy. He then proceeded to harass ships off the Italian coast. News of Pompey&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Pharsalus caused Cassius to head for the Hellespont, with hopes of allying with the king of Pontus, Pharnaces II. Cassius was overtaken by Caesar en route, and was forced to surrender unconditionally.

Caesar made Cassius a legate, employing him in the Alexandrian War against the very same Pharnaces whom Cassius had hoped to join after Pompey&#x27;s defeat at Pharsalus. However, Cassius refused to join in the fight against Cato and Scipio in Africa, choosing instead to retire to Rome.

Cassius spent the next two years in office, and apparently tightened his friendship with Cicero. In 44 BC, he became &quot;praetor peregrinus&quot; with the promise of the Syrian province for the ensuing year. The appointment of his junior and brother-in-law, Marcus Brutus, as &quot;praetor urbanus&quot; deeply offended him.

Although Cassius was &quot;the moving spirit&quot; in the plot against Caesar, winning over the chief assassins to the cause of tyrannicide, Brutus became their leader. On the Ides of March, 44 BC, Cassius urged on his fellow liberators and struck Caesar in the chest. Though they succeeded in assassinating Caesar, the celebration was short-lived, as Mark Antony seized power and turned the public against them. In letters written during 44 BC, Cicero frequently complains that Rome was still subjected to tyranny, because the &quot;Liberators&quot; had failed to kill Antony. According to some accounts, Cassius had wanted to kill Antony at the same time as Caesar, but Brutus dissuaded him.
===Post-assassination===
Cassius&#x27; reputation in the East made it easy to amass an army from other governors in the area, and by 43 BC, he was ready to take on Publius Cornelius Dolabella with 12 legions. By this point, the Senate had split with Antonius, and cast its lot with Cassius, confirming him as governor of the province. Dolabella attacked but was betrayed by his allies, leading him to commit suicide. Cassius was now secure enough to march on Egypt, but on the formation of the Second Triumvirate, Brutus requested his assistance. Cassius quickly joined Brutus in Smyrna with most of his army, leaving his nephew behind to govern Syria as well.

The conspirators decided to attack the triumvirate&#x27;s allies in Asia. Cassius set upon and sacked Rhodes, while Brutus did the same to Lycia. They regrouped the following year in Sardis, where their armies proclaimed them imperator. They crossed the Hellespont, marched through Thrace, and encamped near Philippi in Macedon. Gaius Julius Caesar Octavian (later known as Augustus) and Mark Antony soon arrived, and Cassius planned to starve them out through the use of their superior position in the country. However, they were forced into a pair of battles by Antony, collectively known as the Battle of Philippi. Brutus was successful against Octavian, and took his camp. Cassius, however, was defeated and overrun by Mark Antony and, unaware of Brutus&#x27; victory, ordered his freeman Pindarus to help him kill himself. Pindarus fled afterwards and Cassius&#x27; head was found severed from his body. He was mourned by Brutus as &quot;the Last of the Romans&quot; and buried in Thassos.

==Epicureanism==
&quot;Among that select band of philosophers who have managed to change the world,&quot; writes David Sedley, &quot;it would be hard to find a pair with a higher public profile than Brutus and Cassius – brothers-in-law, fellow-assassins, and Shakespearian heroes,&quot; adding that &quot;it may not even be widely known that they &quot;were&quot; philosophers.&quot;

Like Brutus, whose Stoic proclivities are widely assumed but who is more accurately described as an Antiochean Platonist, Cassius exercised a long and serious interest in philosophy. His early philosophical commitments are hazy, though D.R. Shackleton Bailey thought that a remark by Cicero indicates a youthful adherence to the Academy. Sometime between 48 and 45 BC, however, Cassius famously converted to the school of thought founded by Epicurus. Although Epicurus advocated a withdrawal from politics, at Rome his philosophy was made to accommodate the careers of many prominent men in public life, among them Caesar&#x27;s father-in-law, Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus. Arnaldo Momigliano called Cassius&#x27; conversion a &quot;conspicuous date in the history of Roman Epicureanism,&quot; a choice made not to enjoy the pleasures of the Garden, but to provide a philosophical justification for assassinating a tyrant.

Cicero associates Cassius&#x27;s new Epicureanism with a willingness to seek peace in the aftermath of the civil war between Caesar and Pompeius. Miriam Griffin dates his conversion to as early as 48 BC, after he had fought on the side of Pompeius at the Battle of Pharsalus but decided to come home instead of joining the last holdouts of the civil war in Africa. Momigliano placed it in 46 BC, based on a letter by Cicero to Cassius dated January 45. Shackleton Bailey points to a date of two or three years earlier.

The dating bears on, but is not essential to, the question of whether Cassius justified the murder of Caesar on Epicurean grounds. Griffin argues that his intellectual pursuits, like those of other Romans, may be entirely removed from any practical application in the realm of politics. Romans of the Late Republic who can be identified as Epicureans are more often found among the supporters of Caesar, and often literally in his camp. Momigliano argued, however, that many of those who opposed Caesar&#x27;s dictatorship bore no personal animus toward him, and Republicanism was more congenial to the Epicurean way of life than dictatorship. The Roman concept of &quot;libertas&quot; had been integrated into Greek philosophical studies, and though Epicurus&#x27; theory of the political governance admitted various forms of government based on consent, including but not limited to democracy, a tyrannical state was regarded by Roman Epicureans as incompatible with the highest good of pleasure, defined as freedom from pain. Tyranny also threatened the Epicurean value of &quot;parrhesia&quot; (παρρησία), &quot;truthful speaking,&quot; and the movement toward deifying Caesar offended Epicurean belief in abstract gods who lead an ideal existence removed from mortal affairs.

Momigliano saw Cassius as moving from an initial Epicurean orthodoxy, which emphasised disinterest in matters not of vice and virtue, and detachment, to a &quot;heroic Epicureanism.&quot; For Cassius, virtue was active. In a letter to Cicero, he wrote:

Sedley agrees that the conversion of Cassius should be dated to 48, when Cassius stopped resisting Caesar, and finds it unlikely that Epicureanism was a sufficient or primary motivation for his later decision to take violent action against the dictator. Rather, Cassius would have had to reconcile his intention with his philosophical views. Cicero provides evidence that Epicureans recognized circumstances when direct action was justified in a political crisis. In the quotation above, Cassius explicitly rejects the idea that morality is good to be chosen for its own sake; morality, as a means of achieving pleasure and &quot;ataraxia&quot;, is not inherently superior to the removal of political anxieties.

The inconsistencies between traditional Epicureanism and an active approach to securing freedom ultimately could not be resolved, and during the Empire, the philosophy of political opposition tended to be Stoic. This circumstance, Momigliano argues, helps explain why historians of the Imperial era found Cassius more difficult to understand than Brutus, and less admirable.

==Cultural depictions==
In Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot; (Canto XXXIV), Cassius is one of three people deemed sinful enough to be chewed in one of the three mouths of Satan, in the very centre of Hell, for all eternity, as a punishment for killing Julius Caesar. The other two are Brutus, his fellow conspirator, and Judas Iscariot, the Biblical betrayer of Jesus. It is unknown why the third ringleader of the conspiracy to kill Caesar, Decimus Brutus, was not also shown this deep in Hell.

Cassius also plays a major role in Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (I. ii. 190–195) as the leader of the conspiracy to assassinate Caesar. Caesar distrusts him, and states, &quot;Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look; He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.&quot; In one of the final scenes of the play, Cassius mentions to one of his subordinates that the day, October 3, is his birthday, and dies shortly afterwards.

<text>Publius Cornelius Dolabella ( – 43 BC, also known by his adoptive name Lentulus) was a Roman politician and general under the dictator Julius Caesar. He was by far the most important of the patrician Cornelii Dolabellae but he arranged for himself to be adopted into the plebeian Cornelii Lentuli so that he could become a plebeian tribune. He married Cicero&#x27;s daughter, Tullia, although he frequently engaged in extramarital affairs. Throughout his life he was an extreme profligate, something that Plutarch wrote reflected ill upon his patron Julius Caesar.

==Biography==
===Early life===
His father was likely the urban praetor of 69 BC, Publius Cornelius Dolabella, who also served as governor of Asia. Dolabella was related to the Servilii Caepiones.

Dolabella&#x27;s birth date is uncertain.

===Military and political careers===
In the Civil Wars (49–45 BC) Dolabella at first took the side of Pompey, but afterwards went over to Julius Caesar, and was present when Caesar prevailed at the Battle of Pharsalus (48 BC).

Dolabella had himself adopted by a plebeian so that he could become tribune of the plebs. His adoptive father has been supposed to have been a Lentulus Marcellinus (but the plebeian status of people of this branch is disputed) or Lentulus Vatia but there is no certainty in the matter. In either case the adopter would likely have been a supporter of Caesar. There was also a woman named Livia who expressed interest in adopting Dolabella (possibly on the behalf of her husband, since women could not adopt legally), but it is unknown if this woman&#x27;s proposal was in any way connected to his adoption by Lentulus.

As a tribune for the plebs for 47 BC, Dolabella had tried to bring about constitutional changes, one of which (to escape the urgent demands of his creditors) was a bill proposing that all debts should be canceled. He tried to enlist the support of Mark Antony, but his fellow tribunes Gaius Asinius Pollio, consul in 40 BC, and Lucius Trebellius Fides advised Antony not to support the measure. Antony, who also suspected he had been cuckolded by Dolabella, took up arms against him when Dolabella occupied the Forum in an attempt to use force to pass the bill. The Senate voted to support this, and a clash ensued in which both sides took losses. Upon his return from Alexandria, Caesar, seeing the expediency of removing Dolabella from Rome, pardoned him, and subsequently took him as one of his generals in the expedition to Africa and Spain.

After Caesar had returned to Rome and been elected consul for the fifth time, he proposed to the Senate that his consulship be transferred to Dolabella. Antony protested, causing a huge disruption that made Caesar withdraw the motion out of shame. Later, Caesar exercised his role as dictator and directly proclaimed Dolabella consul. This time Antony called out that the omens were unfavorable and Caesar again backed down and abandoned Dolabella.

On Caesar&#x27;s death in 44 BC, Dolabella seized the insignia of the consulship (which had already been conditionally promised him), and, by making friends with Brutus and the other assassins, was confirmed in his office. When, however, Mark Antony offered him the command of the expedition against the Parthians and the province of Syria, he changed sides at once. His journey to the province was marked by plundering, extortion, and the murder of Gaius Trebonius, governor of Asia, who refused to allow him to enter Smyrna.

Dolabella was thereupon declared a public enemy and superseded by Cassius who attacked him in Laodicea. When Cassius&#x27;s troops captured the place (43 BC), Dolabella ordered one of his soldiers to kill him.

===Marriages===
Dolabella was married to a woman named Fabia and had a son by the same name with her. The son may have been Publius Cornelius Dolabella the consul of 35 BC. He was also married to Cicero&#x27;s daughter Tullia in 50 BC. In May 49 BC she gave birth to a premature son of seven months that did not survive long after birth. In 45 BC Tullia divorced him and gave birth to a son named Lentulus at her father&#x27;s house, some weeks after the birth she died of complications and the boy is suspected to have died young since his grandfather Cicero does not mention him after 45 BC.

==Cultural depictions==
===Stage===
Dolabella plays a focal role in John Dryden&#x27;s 1600s play &quot;All for Love&quot;, where he is portrayed as warning Cleopatra about Octavian planning to kidnap her and her children to Rome, which convinces Cleopatra to kill herself. This version of Dolabella is highly fictionalized and a composite character of several ancient Roman people. A similar version of Dolabella appears in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; as an ally of Octavian, though again this is likely a composite character.

===Literature===
He also appears as a character in the novel &quot;The Bloodied Toga&quot; by William George Hardy. He is also a supporting character in the &quot;Masters of Rome&quot; series by Colleen McCullough.

<doc id="77618" wikidata="Q182870" url="?curid=77618" title="Mario Puzo">
<text>Mario Francis Puzo (; ; October 15, 1920 – July 2, 1999) was an American author and screenwriter. He wrote crime novels about the Italian-American Mafia and Sicilian Mafia, most notably &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1969), which he later co-adapted into a film trilogy directed by Francis Ford Coppola. He received the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for the first film in 1972 and for &quot;Part II&quot; in 1974. Puzo also wrote the original screenplay for the 1978 &quot;Superman&quot; film and its 1980 sequel. His final novel, &quot;The Family&quot;, was released posthumously in 2001.

==Personal life==
Puzo was born in the Hell&#x27;s Kitchen section of New York City to Italian immigrants from the Province of Avellino; his father was from Pietradefusi and his mother from Ariano Irpino. When Puzo was 12, his father, who worked as a trackman for the New York Central Railroad, was committed to the Pilgrim State Hospital for schizophrenia, and his wife Maria was left to raise their seven children. 

Mario Puzo served in the United States Army Air Forces in Germany in World War II, and later graduated from the City College of New York. Puzo married a German woman, Erika Lina Broske, with whom he had five children. When Erika died of breast cancer at the age of 57 in 1978, her nurse, Carol Gino, became Puzo&#x27;s companion.

==Career==
In 1950, Puzo&#x27;s first short story, &quot;The Last Christmas,&quot; was published in &quot;American Vanguard&quot; and republished in the 1953 anthology &quot;New Voices: American Writing Today #1&quot;. After the war, he wrote his first book, the novel &quot;The Dark Arena&quot;, which was published in 1955.

In 1960, Bruce Jay Friedman hired Puzo as an assistant editor of a group of men&#x27;s pulp magazines with titles such as &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Men&quot;. Under the pen name Mario Cleri, Puzo wrote World War II adventure features for magazine &quot;True Action&quot;. A November 1965 short story, &quot;Six Graves to Munich&quot;, was expanded into a novel in October 1967, and adapted into a &quot;film&quot; in 1982.

In 1969, Puzo&#x27;s best-known work, &quot;The Godfather&quot;, was published. Puzo stated that this story came from research into organized crime, not from personal experience, and that he was looking to write something that would have wide popular appeal. The novel remained on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for 67 weeks and sold over nine million copies in two years. The book was later developed into the film &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972), directed by Francis Ford Coppola. Paramount Pictures originally found out about Puzo&#x27;s novel in 1967 when a literary scout for the company contacted then Paramount Vice President of Production Peter Bart about Puzo&#x27;s unfinished sixty-page manuscript. Bart believed the work was &quot;much beyond a Mafia story&quot; and offered Puzo a $12,500 option for the work, with an option for $80,000 if the finished work were made into a film. Despite Puzo&#x27;s agent telling him to turn down the offer, Puzo was desperate for money and accepted the deal. Paramount&#x27;s Robert Evans relates that, when they met in early 1968, he offered Puzo the $12,500 deal for the 60-page manuscript titled &quot;Mafia&quot; after the author confided in him that he urgently needed $10,000 to pay off gambling debts. The film received three awards of its 11 Oscar category nominations, including Puzo&#x27;s Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay.

Coppola and Puzo then collaborated on sequels to the original film, &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; (1974) and &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; (1990). Coppola and Puzo preferred the title &quot;The Death of Michael Corleone&quot; for the third film, but Paramount Pictures found that unacceptable. In September 2020, for the film&#x27;s 30th anniversary, it was announced that a new cut of the film titled &quot;Mario Puzo&#x27;s The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone&quot; would have a limited theatrical release in December 2020 followed by digital and Blu-ray. Coppola said the film is the version he and Puzo had originally envisioned, and it &quot;vindicates&quot; its status among the trilogy.

In mid-1972, Puzo wrote the first draft of the script for the 1974 disaster film &quot;Earthquake&quot;, but he was unable to continue work because of his prior commitment to &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;. Work continued on the script without his involvement, with writer George Fox (working on his first, and only, motion picture screenplay) and producer / director Mark Robson, who remained uncredited as a writer. Puzo retained screen credit in the completed film as a result of a quickly-settled lawsuit over story credit (most elements from his first draft made it into the final film), and Puzo&#x27;s name subsequently featured heavily in the advertising. Puzo also wrote the original screenplay for Richard Donner&#x27;s &quot;Superman&quot;, which then also included the plot for &quot;Superman II&quot;, as they were originally written as one film. He also collaborated on the stories for the 1982 film &quot;A Time to Die&quot; and the 1984 Francis Ford Coppola film &quot;The Cotton Club&quot;.

In 1991, Puzo&#x27;s speculative fiction &quot;The Fourth K&quot; was published. It centres on a fictional member of the Kennedy family dynasty who becomes President of the United States early in the 2000s.

Puzo never saw the publication of his penultimate book, &quot;Omertà&quot;, but the manuscript was finished before his death, as was the manuscript for &quot;The Family&quot;. However, in a review originally published in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, Jules Siegel, who had worked closely with Puzo at Magazine Management Company, speculated that &quot;Omertà&quot; may have been completed by &quot;some talentless hack&quot;. Siegel also acknowledged the temptation to &quot;rationalize avoiding what is probably the correct analysis, that [Puzo] wrote it and it is terrible&quot;.

==Death==
Puzo died of heart failure on July 2, 1999, at his home in West Bay Shore, New York, at the age of 78.

==In popular culture==
In April 2022, Paramount+ began streaming &quot;The Offer&quot;, a 10-episode dramatic mini-series telling a fictionalized story of the making of &quot;The Godfather&quot;, including Puzo&#x27;s decision to write the first book in what came to be a series. Patrick Gallo plays Puzo. Victoria Kelleher plays his wife, Erika.

<doc id="77619" wikidata="Q1620416" url="?curid=77619" title="Kings Row">
<text>Kings Row is a 1942 film starring Ann Sheridan, Robert Cummings, Ronald Reagan and Betty Field that tells a story of young people growing up in a small American town at the turn of the twentieth century. The picture was directed by Sam Wood. The film was adapted by Casey Robinson from a best-selling 1940 novel of the same name by Henry Bellamann. The musical score was composed by Erich Wolfgang Korngold, and the cinematographer was James Wong Howe. The supporting cast features Charles Coburn, Claude Rains, Judith Anderson and Maria Ouspenskaya.

==Plot==
In the small midwestern town of Kings Row, five children grow up together in the 1890s: Parris Mitchell, a polite, clever little boy who lives with his grandmother; pretty blonde Cassandra Tower, daughter of the secretive Dr. Alexander Tower and a mother that is seen only through the upstairs window; the orphaned but wealthy and fun-loving Drake McHugh who is best friends with Parris; Louise Gordon, daughter of the town physician Dr. Henry Gordon; and the tomboy Randy Monaghan, from the wrong side of the tracks, whose father, Tom, is a railroad worker.

Parris is both friends with and is drawn to Cassandra whom the other children avoid because her family is &quot;strange&quot;. They play together regularly. The boys are best friends and Randy plays with them sometimes. When Dr. Tower takes Cassie out of school and she is confined at home, Parris does not see her for many years.

He finally meets her again when she opens the door for him to begin his medical studies under Dr. Tower&#x27;s tutelage. However, she is very hesitant and says almost nothing. The next morning, Parris&#x27; best friend, Drake, says that he intends to marry Louise who is in love with him as well despite the disapproval of her father, Dr. Gordon. Louise, however, refuses to defy her parents and will not marry him. As Parris continues his studies with Dr. Tower, he and Cassie begin a secret romance, seeing each other at Drake’s house. But he and Dr. Tower have a good relationship as well. Dr. Tower has interested Parris in psychiatry which he intends to study in Vienna. Parris&#x27; grandmother becomes ill from cancer and dies as he is about to go overseas for medical school. Parris wants to marry Cassie after he returns from his training. One night Cassie comes desperately to him, begging him to take her with him. When Parris hesitates, she runs back home.

The next morning, Drake learns that Dr. Tower has poisoned Cassie and shot himself and has left his entire estate to Parris. Parris finds Dr. Tower&#x27;s notebook which showed that he killed Cassie because he believed he saw early signs that she might go insane like her mother and he wanted to prevent Parris from ruining his life by marrying her, just as Tower&#x27;s life had been ruined by marrying Cassie&#x27;s mother.

While Parris is in Vienna, Drake begins to court Randy. Drake&#x27;s trust fund is stolen by a dishonest bank president and he is forced into a menial position with the railroad. His legs are injured in an accident and amputated by Dr. Gordon. Drake and Randy marry but he is embittered by the loss of his legs and refuses to leave his bed. Parris exchanges letters with Randy who tells her how she might best support Drake emotionally. Parris allows them to move into the Towers&#x27; estate. They decide to borrow money and start a business building houses for working families. Parris returns from Vienna to Kings Row to see Drake. But when Parris suggests they build a home in their own development away from the railroad tracks and the sounds of the trains which plague Drake, he becomes hysterical and makes Randy swear to never make him leave the room.

When Parris learns that Dr. Gordon has died, leaving the town with no doctor, he decides to stay in Kings Row. Louise reveals that her father amputated Drake&#x27;s legs because he hated Drake and thought it was his duty to &quot;punish wickedness&quot; which would prevent him from ever marrying his daughter. Parris at first wishes to withhold the truth from Drake, fearing it will destroy his fragile recovery. He considers confining Louise to a mental institution (even though she&#x27;s not insane) to prevent her and the community learning the truth.

When out walking, he sees what appears to be an apparition of Cassie by the pond the two of them used to go to. It is Elise who has moved into his childhood home with her father. Parris grows close to them both and discusses the problem regarding Louise with Elise. She persuades him to treat Drake like any other patient rather than his best friend. Parris frees Louise to reveal all she knows and tells Drake what happened and why. Drake reacts with laughter and defiance, summoning a renewed will to live. Clear of conscience and reinvigorated as a fledgling psychiatrist, Parris rushes to his former home and into Elise’s arms.

==Production==
Wolfgang Reinhardt refused an assignment to produce the film, saying, &quot;As far as plot is concerned, the material in &quot;Kings Row&quot; is for the most part either censurable or too gruesome and depressing to be used. The hero finding out that his girl has been carrying on incestuous relations with her father... a host of moronic or otherwise mentally diseased characters... people dying from cancer, suicides–these are the principal elements of the story.&quot;

===The Hays Code===
A film adaptation of Bellamann&#x27;s controversial novel, modeled on his home town of Fulton, Missouri, presented significant problems for movie industry censors who sought to bring the film into conformity with the Hays Code. Screenwriter Casey Robinson believed the project was hopeless because of the Code. Producer Hal B. Wallis said that Robinson felt &quot;I was crazy to have bought so downbeat a property.&quot; Wallis urged him to reconsider and Robinson realized that he could turn this into the story of &quot;an idealistic young doctor challenged by the realities of a cruel and horrifying world.&quot;

Joseph Breen, director of the Production Code Authority which administered the Hays Code wrote the producers that &quot;To attempt to translate such a story to the screen even though it be re-written to conform to the provisions of the Production Code is, in our judgment, a very questionable undertaking from the standpoint of the good and welfare of this industry.&quot;

Breen objected to &quot;illicit sexual relationships&quot; between characters in the movie &quot;without sufficient compensating moral values&quot;. He also objected to &quot;the general suggestion of loose sex...which carries throughout the entire script.&quot; Breen was further concerned about the characterization of Cassandra as a victim of incest with her father, the mercy killing of the grandmother by Parris and &quot;the sadistic characterization of Dr. Gordon.&quot;

Breen said that any screenplay, no matter how well done, would likely bring condemnation of the film industry &quot;from decent people everywhere&quot; because of &quot;the fact that it stems from so thoroughly questionable a novel. He said that the script was being referred to his superior, Will Hays, &quot;for a decision as to the acceptability of &quot;any&quot; production based upon the novel, &quot;Kings Row&quot;.&quot;
Robinson, Wallis and associate producer David Lewis met with Breen to resolve these issues with Wallis saying that the film would &quot;illustrate how a doctor could relieve the internal destruction of a stricken community.&quot; Breen said that his office would approve the film if all references to incest, nymphomania, euthanasia and homosexuality which the novel suggested, be removed. All references to nude bathing were to be eliminated and &quot;the suggestion of a sex affair between Randy and Drake will be eliminated entirely.&quot; It was agreed that Dr. Tower would know about the affair between Cassandra and Parris and &quot;that this had something to do with his killing of the girl.&quot;

After several drafts were rejected, Robinson was able to satisfy Breen.

===Casting===
Twentieth-Century Fox originally sought to buy Bellamann&#x27;s novel as a vehicle for Henry Fonda. Philip Reed, Rex Downing, and Tyrone Power were considered for the role of Parris. In April 1941, Robert Cummings was mentioned as the leading favorite if Power could not be borrowed. Cummings did a screen test and by May had the role. Cummings was tied up filming a Deanna Durbin film but the filmmakers were willing to postpone shooting for him. In September, filming was shut down for a week as Cummings was recalled to do reshoots on the Durbin film.

Ida Lupino, Olivia de Havilland and Ginger Rogers were initially considered for the role of Cassandra. Director Sam Wood pushed hard to cast Lupino saying that she &quot;has a natural something that Cassie should have.&quot; Wood believed that de Havilland, who refused the role, was too mature for the part. Lupino also refused it despite Wallis&#x27; emphatic arguments saying that it was &quot;beneath her as an artist.&quot; Bette Davis wanted the part but the studio was against it because they believed that she would dominate the movie. Davis later suggested Betty Field. Among the other actresses considered for Cassandra were Katharine Hepburn, Adele Longmire, Marsha Hunt, Laraine Day, Susan Peters, Joan Leslie, Gene Tierney and Priscilla Lane.

James Stephenson was originally cast as Dr. Tower but died, and was replaced by Claude Rains.

Before Ronald Reagan was cast, the studio considered John Garfield for the role of Drake McHugh. So were Dennis Morgan, Eddie Albert, Robert Preston, and Franchot Tone. Although Reagan became a star as a result of his performance, he was unable to capitalize on his success because he was drafted into the U.S. Army to serve in World War II. He never regained the star status that he had achieved from his performance in the film.

===Filming===
Filming started in July, 1941 and continued until October.

The pivotal scene in which Drake McHugh wakes up to find his legs amputated posed an acting challenge for Reagan who was supposed to say &quot;Where&#x27;s the rest of me?&quot; in a convincing manner. In &quot;City of Nets&quot;, Otto Friedrich noted that the movie had a formidable array of acting talent and the scene in which Reagan saw that his legs were gone was his &quot;one great opportunity.&quot; Reagan recalled in his memoir that he had &quot;neither the experience nor talent to fake it,&quot; so he undertook exhaustive research, talking to doctors and to people with disabilities and practicing the line every chance he got.

On the night before the scene was shot, he had little sleep so he looked suitably worn out. Sam Wood shot the scene without rehearsal. He called out for Randy which was not in the script but Ann Sheridan was there and responded. The scene was extremely effective and there was no need for another take.

==Themes==
Bellaman, a professor at Vassar College, was a disciple of Honoré de Balzac. His novel was in the tradition of &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; and was a forerunner of the popular 1950s novel &quot;Peyton Place&quot;.

The film begins with a billboard promoting Kings Row as &quot;A Good Town. A Good, Clean Town. A Good Town to Live In and a Good Place to Raise Your Children.&quot; In his book &quot;City of Nets&quot;, author Otto Friedrich says that beneath the tranquil, small-town exterior was a &quot;roiling inferno of fraud, corruption, treachery, hypocrisy, class warfare and ill-suppressed sex of all varieties: adultery, sadism, homosexuality, incest.&quot;

The film is a eulogy for American small town life in the Victorian era. At one point a character laments at seeing Parris&#x27; grandmother getting older: &quot;A whole way of life. A way of gentleness and honor and dignity. These things are going... and they may never come back to this world.&quot;

==Musical score==
The film&#x27;s musical score by Erich Wolfgang Korngold was so popular with the public that the Warner Brothers Music Department drafted a form letter response to questions about recordings and sheet music. At the time, film scores for movie dramas were not published or recorded for commercial distribution.

A soundtrack was not commercially available until 1979 when Chalfont Records, with the composer&#x27;s son George Korngold as producer and an orchestra conducted by Charles Gerhardt, made an early digital recording. Subsequently, the original soundtrack with the composer conducting was released from an optical recording.

&quot;Kings Row&quot; is considered one of Korngold&#x27;s more popular compositions. The White House requested the original orchestral score for Ronald Reagan&#x27;s presidential inauguration. Academy Award winning film composer John Williams drew inspiration from the film&#x27;s soundtrack for his famous Star Wars opening theme.

Before releasing the film, the &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot; reported that Henry Bellamann &quot;heads west to help Erich Wolfgang Korngold on the scoring&quot; of the film, and that Bellamann used to be on the faculty of the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. This led Korngold to send a sarcastic letter to the head of studio publicity at Warner Brothers writing &quot;Seriously, should I really stop working and wait for the arrival of Mr. Bellamann? ... however, if he shouldn&#x27;t arrive in time to help &quot;me&quot;, I shall certainly be ready to &#x27;head east&quot; Perhaps, &quot;I&quot; could help &quot;him&quot; in writing his new book!&quot;

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
According to &quot;Variety&quot;, the film earned $2,350,000 in rentals in the US in 1942. According to Warner Bros records it earned $3,143,000 domestically and $1,950,000 foreign.

=== Critical response ===

&quot;The New York Times&quot; film critic Bosley Crowther panned &quot;Kings Row&quot; which he described as being as &quot;gloomy and ponderous&quot; as the novel upon which it was based. &quot;Just why the Warners attempted a picture of this sort in these times and just why the corps of high priced artists which they employed for it did such a bungling job&quot;, Crowther wrote, &quot;are questions which they are probably mulling more anxiously than any one else.&quot; Crowther wrote that the film &quot;turgidly unfolds on the screen&quot;, and is &quot;one of the bulkiest blunders to come out of Hollywood in some time&quot;. The performances, particularly Cummings&#x27;, were, he wrote, &quot;totally lacking in conviction&quot;. The film, he wrote, &quot;just shows a lot of people feeling bad&quot;.

The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; saw Sheridan and Reagan as &quot;real and believable&quot; in their roles and that Cummings did &quot;the best that could be done&quot;. Otherwise, the film was described as &quot;a long and dreary melodrama in two parts.., years of misery and maladjustment to young womanhood and young manhood...&quot;Kings Row&quot; is the story of a town with a &#x27;right&#x27; and &#x27;wrong&#x27; side of the tracks and the story of the town&#x27;s inhabitants is a coat of many colors and is outstanding as being a gangrenous yellow.&quot;

The &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot; was likewise negative: &quot;&quot;Kings Row&quot; is packed with the best talent at the Warners command…. David Lewis has given it all an unstinted production and James Wong Howe, one of Hollywood&#x27;s best shooters, has turned the cameras on it. So full of great promise, &quot;Kings Row&quot; came last night to the Astor Theater…. It should have been great but it isn&#x27;t….&quot;Kings Row&quot; never comes to life. Its characters are made of clay…. It is hard to feel sorry for them for they are unreal. It is even harder to be happy for them for there&#x27;s precious little to be happy about. &quot;Kings Row&quot;, to say the best for it, is a frightening town with a disturbing citizenry…. There might have been a point to all this grimness. It stood up well in the book even amid the grimness of war. But at the Astor, the mood takes precedence over the characters and their drama. &quot;Kings Row&quot; is more horrifying than poignant. It seems to be played more for the chills of fright than for the warmth of drama.

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 100% of 17 critics gave the film a positive review with an average rating of 7.9/10, earning it a &quot;Fresh&quot; score.

&quot;Time Out Film Guide&quot; described the film as &quot;one of the great melodramas&quot; and &quot;as compulsive and perverse as any election, a veritable Mount Rushmore of emotional and physical cripples, including a surgeon with a penchant for unnecessary amputations, a girl who &#x27;made friends on one side of the tracks and made love on the other&#x27;.&quot;

&quot;TV Guide&quot; wrote that &quot;Kings Row&quot; was &quot;one of the most memorable melodramas of its day&quot;, in that it portrayed &quot;a small town not with the poignancy and little joys of Thornton Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Our Town&quot; but rather in grim, often tragic tones&quot;. The magazine described the film as &quot;one of director Wood&#x27;s finest films&quot; and praised Robinson&#x27;s screenplay &quot;even if he cut out a death from cancer, deleted a mercy killing, and toned down the narrative&#x27;s homosexual angle&quot;. It described Korngold&#x27;s score as &quot;haunting&quot; and the sets &quot;quite stunning&quot;. James Wong Howe&#x27;s &quot;gorgeous cinematography, meanwhile, maintains many layers of drama in deep focus, as befits this brooding tapestry&quot;.

=== Accolades ===
The film was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Cinematography, Black-and-White (James Wong Howe), Best Director and Best Picture.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2005: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes:

In the film, Reagan&#x27;s character, Drake McHugh, has both legs amputated by a sadistic surgeon, played by Coburn. When he comes to, following the operation, he gasps in shock, disbelief, and horror, &quot;Where&#x27;s the rest of me?&quot; Reagan used that line as the title of his 1965 autobiography. Reagan and most film critics considered &quot;Kings Row&quot; his best film. Reagan called the film a &quot;slightly sordid but moving yarn&quot; that &quot;made me a star.&quot;

== Television series ==
The film was adapted into a 1955 television series, with Jack Kelly who later portrayed Bart Maverick in &quot;Maverick&quot; with James Garner as Bret Maverick) in Cummings&#x27; role and Robert Horton who subsequently played scout Flint McCullough in &quot;Wagon Train&quot; performing Reagan&#x27;s part. The show appeared as one of three rotating series on the earliest William T. Orr production, &quot;Warner Bros. Presents&quot;. The other two series were &quot;Casablanca&quot;, another TV version of a renowned movie (featuring Charles McGraw in Humphrey Bogart&#x27;s role), and &quot;Cheyenne&quot;, starring Clint Walker, a Western later produced by Roy Huggins that went on to its own time slot for several years until it started rotating with &quot;Bronco&quot; which starred Ty Hardin, another Warner Bros. Western. At the conclusion of each episode of &quot;Warner Bros. Presents&quot;, host Gig Young would interview a different actor from a new Warner Brothers movie about the studio&#x27;s latest theatrical release. &quot;Kings Row&quot; ran for seven episodes.

<text>The Junior Woodchucks of the World is a fictional scouting organization appearing in Disney comics and the &quot;DuckTales&quot; animated television franchise, most notably in adventures featuring Disney characters Huey, Dewey, and Louie as members.

The Junior Woodchucks were created by Carl Barks in 1951, in the story &quot;Operation St. Bernard&quot; (&quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; #125). Later stories introduced a similar organization for girls, the Littlest Chickadees, to which Daisy Duck&#x27;s nieces, April, May and June belong. The hallmark of the Junior Woodchucks is their spirited dedication to environmental protection, animal welfare and international peace, as well as the preservation of knowledge and the furtherance of science &amp; technology. They are also known for their exalted titles &amp; ranks (Huey, Dewey, and Louie being promoted to become &quot;Ten-Star Generals&quot; in the 1951 story of the same name) and the awarding of buckets of badges, along with strict ideals as to their certain decorum. In this way Barks poked gentle but pointed satire at some aspects of the Boy Scouts of America.

Members always carry with them a copy of the &quot;Junior Woodchucks&#x27; Guidebook&quot;, a fictional guidebook filled with detailed and pertinent information about whatever country or situation the Woodchucks find themselves, ranging from the basic to the incredibly obscure. Its depth of coverage is remarkable, considering that it is a small paperback book. Narratively, the book is a device that allows the story&#x27;s writer to insert any information or exposition that&#x27;s needed to move the story forward.

Most of the early Junior Woodchucks stories appeared in &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot;, with some notable appearances in &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot;. In 1966, they got their own title, &quot;Huey, Dewey, and Louie and the Junior Woodchucks&quot;, published by Gold Key Comics for 62 issues, and then continued by Whitman Comics for another 20 issues until 1983. The stories which Carl Barks wrote for this comic book, among the last comic book stories he scripted, were drawn by Kay Wright, John Carey and Tony Strobl. More recently Daan Jippes has been commissioned by Egmont to redraw these stories emulating Barks&#x27; style and drawing inspiration from the sketches of Barks&#x27; storyboard-like scripts.

The non-Disney strip &quot;Big Nate&quot; also features a scouting organisation with the same name, to which eponymous Nate Wright and his friends Francis Pope and Teddy Ortiz belong, which was later changed to the Timber Scouts.

==History==
The Junior Woodchucks first appeared in Barks&#x27; 10-page Donald Duck story &quot;Operation St Bernard&quot; (&quot;WDC&amp;S&quot; #125, February 1951). While the Woodchucks ultimately became a familiar and beloved element in the Duck universe, Barks&#x27; original intention was satirical. Thomas Andrae says, &quot;Throughout the story, Barks satirizes the Woodchucks&#x27; elitism, obsession with rank, and paramilitary discipline. Major is the lowest rank in the Woodchucks, and every trooper has a lofty title and wears quarts of medals... Parodying the mystique of military language, Barks makes a running gag of converting Woodchuck titles into unintelligible acronyms.&quot;

The Junior Woodchucks stories tended to &quot;civilize&quot; the nephews, who were usually seen as mischievous and immature in the 1940s. In the second Woodchucks story, &quot;Ten-Star Generals&quot; (&quot;WDC&amp;S&quot; #132, Sept 1951), the boys are very serious about passing their scout tests in the proper Woodchuck way, refusing to be tempted by Donald&#x27;s encouragement to take shortcuts. Just a month later, they would be playing hooky from school. In a 1975 interview, Barks explained that he appreciated the mutability of the characters: &quot;I began making them into sort of smart little guys once in a while, and very clumsy little guys at other times, and always, I aimed at surprise in each story so that nobody could pick up a comic book and say, &#x27;Well, the nephews are going to behave thus and so.&#x27; They wouldn&#x27;t know until they read the story just what those little guys were going to be up to in a particular sequence.&quot;

&quot;The Junior Woodchucks&#x27; Book of Knowledge&quot; was first mentioned in &quot;The Secret of Atlantis&quot; (&quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; #5, March–May 1954). In the next issue&#x27;s story, &quot;Tralla La&quot;, the book made its first appearance as &quot;The Junior Woodchuck&#x27;s Guidebook&quot; (&quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; #6, June 1954). Historian Michael Barrier claims that the use of the &quot;Guidebook&quot; had a negative influence on the nephews&#x27; characterization, saying, &quot;The &quot;Guidebook&quot; soon became something like a crutch. Faced with a dilemma, the nephews were more likely to rely on the Guidebook, seemingly a compendium of all human knowledge, than on their wits.&quot;

Barks introduced a female version of the Woodchucks — the Chickadees, featuring Daisy&#x27;s nieces April, May and June — in &quot;The Chickadee Challenge&quot; (&quot;WDC&amp;S&quot; #181, Oct 1955), headed by the stern Mrs. Ramrod. The Junior Woodchucks&#x27; official hound, often called General Snozzie, was added to the cast in &quot;Dodging Miss Daisy&quot; (&quot;WDC&amp;S&quot; #213, June 1958).

The Junior Woodchucks had a backup feature for five years in &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot;, from issue #106 to 128 (April 1966 - Feb 1971), written by John Carey and drawn by Tony Strobl.

Gold Key Comics published a &quot;Huey, Dewey &amp; Louie Junior Woodchucks&quot; comic starting in August 1966. The comic began as an annual, featuring stories by Strobl and writer Vic Lockman. In 1969, Barks — who had retired three years earlier — was prevailed upon to write some scripts in storyboard form for the comic, which became a quarterly. Under Barks, the stories came to focus on environmental themes. Other stories in the series were drawn by Jerry Siegel (co-creator of Superman) and Bob Gregory. The series ended with issue #81 in 1984.

In 1992, the Barks stories for the &quot;Junior Woodchucks&quot; title were redrawn by Dutch Disney comics artist Daan Jippes for &quot;Donald Duck Weekblad&quot;.

In 1993, Don Rosa published a memorable story about the history of the &quot;Junior Woodchucks Guidebook&quot; called &quot;Guardians of the Lost Library&quot;, which was first published in the US in &quot;Uncle Scrooge Adventures&quot; #27 (July 1994).

==Junior Woodchucks&#x27; Guidebook==

The &quot;Junior Woodchucks&#x27; Guidebook and Reservoir of Inexhaustible Knowledge&quot;, or the &quot;Junior Woodchucks&#x27; Guidebook&quot; for short, appears to contain information and advice on every possible subject. Huey, Dewey, and Louie frequently consult a volume of the set to get themselves and their uncles Donald Duck and Scrooge McDuck out of dangerous situations (see deus ex machina). It was first mentioned in &quot;The Secret of Atlantis&quot; by Carl Barks in 1954, then called the Junior Woodchucks&#x27; Book of Knowledge. Its history was later discussed in &quot;Guardians of the Lost Library&quot; by Don Rosa in 1993.

According to cartoonist Don Rosa, this book was written by the Guardians of the lost Library of Alexandria, compiling the essence of knowledge that was unique to the Library. It was later found by Cornelius Coot who gave the book to his son Clinton Coot who, in turn, was inspired to form the Junior Woodchucks as a continuation of the Guardians of the Library. One story that is not by Don Rosa says that the Guidebook is updated by an unknown author.

The Woodchuck book seems almost magical in its breadth of information; it almost never fails to provide the required information and yet is small enough to fit into a Junior Woodchuck&#x27;s backpack. In particular, the Guidebook contains information on lost treasure, a complete survival guide, extensive historical and technical information and phrase books for various more or less common languages (like a minimal lizard phrase book), and many more. However, it does not contain information that a Junior Woodchuck is already supposed to know, such as the location of Cape of Good Hope, nor does it contain information on allegedly non-existent things. (In one episode of &quot;DuckTales&quot;, the three nephews faced a dragon and when they consulted the Guidebook, the entry on dragons read that, since dragons did not exist, there was no reason to include information on them; however, in the story on which that episode was based, the guidebook did have an entry on dragons. And, in a story which appeared in &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; entitled &quot;The Golden Fleecing&quot;, the ducklings looked up the question how to put a dragon to sleep and found the answer, &quot;Pull the wool over his eyes.&quot; The boys then covered the dragon&#x27;s eyes with the Golden Fleece, which they had just discovered by going to Colchis on the &quot;Argo&quot; and obtaining it from the Harpies.) On the other hand, the Guidebook does have information on Martian technology, despite the fact that in the &quot;DuckTales&quot; universe Martians had not been discovered when the book was printed. It is missing only one fact: the ranking order of the original Knights Templar, plus one discovered in an ancient Xanadu manuscript. In short, it is a minimal encyclopedia (although the subset of articles is extraordinarily well-chosen), available exclusively to Junior Woodchucks.

Information is readily available by searching the extensive index; the key skill of a Junior Woodchuck is retrieving information quickly from the Woodchuck book in the midst of a dangerous situation, such as a grizzly bear attack, an earthquake, falling out of an airplane &quot;sans&quot; parachute, or being swallowed alive by a crocodile. However, in Carl Barks&#x27; story &quot;So Far and No Safari&quot; (1966), it took the ducklings so long to look up a lifesaving question, it was almost too late. Scrooge subsequently offered to buy the Junior Woodchucks a better index for the Guidebook.

Just as the Junior Woodchucks are based on the Boy Scouts of America, their Guidebook is inspired by the Boy Scout Handbook. The real Handbook (at least in the 1950s) was the same size as the Guidebook and was believed by all Scouts to contain all necessary information. In this respect, the almost limitless and sometimes esoteric knowledge the Guidebook offers is a gently satirical comment on the &quot;Scout Bible&quot;, as the original &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot; by Baden-Powell was sometimes known, the book giving advice on a vast range of subjects, including &quot;Smoking&quot;, &quot;How the Empire Must Be Held&quot;, &quot;Courtesy to Women&quot;, and &quot;How to Revive a Suicide&quot;.

That guide was the inspiration for the &quot;Junior Woodchucks&#x27; Guidebook&quot; (&quot;Il Manuale delle Giovani Marmotte&quot;), a series of several Disney books with tips, advice, general culture, and curious facts about nature and life, released in Italy by Mondadori in seven volumes between 1969 and 1974, and later translated into several languages.

In the story &quot;W.H.A.D.A.L.O.T.T.A.J.A.R.G.O.N.&quot; by Don Rosa the history of the Junior Woodchucks of the World begins with the Woodchuck Militia, a defensive army unit that was formed by Cornelius Coot in the early 19th century to protect Fort Duckburg from Native American warriors and other threats in the area. Clinton Coot, the son of Cornelius Coot, was the founder of the Junior Woodchucks as a Scouting organization for the children and teenagers around Duckburg at the time to uphold the ideals of performing good deeds, protection of the wilderness, rescuing of the innocent, meek &amp; helpless, and the preservation of knowledge. The organization eventually grew larger to include all nations around the world. The first Junior Woodchucks were Grand Marshal Osborne and Exalted Overseer Taliaferro (a reference to Ted Osborn and Al Taliaferro) and Fulton Gearloose, the father of Gyro Gearloose.

The Junior Woodchucks is a para-militaristic organization with its leadership being much more similar to that of army officers than to real-life Scoutmasters. The scouting groups are organized into troops which include titles such as Trooper, Lieutenant-General, Field Marshal and Ten-Star General. Alongside self-reliance, trust and honor are important to the Junior Woodchucks, as its members never lie, as for instance when Huey, Dewey and Louie promised the inhabitants of the sunken city of Atlantis to always keep their city&#x27;s location secret from the outside world.

As the title of the Junior Woodchucks of the World suggest, it is an international organization and has troops across the globe, including Arabia (which consist of Desert Patrol nr. 646), Brazil (which consist of the Rio de Janeiro troops) and the Duckburg troops of the United States.

===Leadership===

The adult leadership of the Junior Woodchucks consists of troop commanders (called Grand Moguls in European comics) whom often has vibrantly acronymized titles which demonstrates their ranking position and professional field. They have also been called Generals in a few stories by Carl Barks. The troop commanders&#x27; uniforms are militaristic in design. They are often white or brown in color with richly decorated gold embroideries; with their headgear often being a woodchuck cap or other types of military headwear. They are also often wearing a lanyard, filled with a large number of elaborately meritorious medals, badges &amp; ribbons which makes them look very dignified and grandiose, and in some cases exceedingly pompous. Only Junior Woodchucks can later become troop commanders.

Again, according to Don Rosa&#x27;s story &quot;W.H.A.D.A.L.O.T.T.A.J.A.R.G.O.N&quot;. the Junior Woodchucks of the World is governed by the Supreme Council; which is probably part of the World Office of the Junior Woodchucks, the organization&#x27;s top office. The council consists of nine high-ranking members whom collectively is called the B.I.G.S.H.O.T.S. (Bureaucratic and Imposing Gathering of Supreme High Officials of the Topmost Strata) with the H.E.A.D.H.O.N.C.H.O. (Highest Executive Administrator of Divisional Headquarters and Organizer of Nearly Complete Hierarchical Overkill) as the head of the council. The Supreme Council is located in the Junior Woodchucks&#x27; World Headquarters in the City of Duckburg.

However, other high ranking titles of uncertain position in leadership has been used within the organization in stories by Carl Barks and others. Some of these include Commander-in-Chief and Exalted Grand Marshal.

A few other acronymized titles within the Junior Woodchucks&#x27; leadership include:
* (1955) G.U.C.O.T.R.O.I.S. (Great, Unopposable Commandant Of The Realm Of Inextinguishale Sagacity) and I.T.S.A.A.D.C.O.T.F.O.I.K. (International Twelve-Star Admiral And Deputy Custodian Of The Fountain Of Inexhaustible Knowledge), a very high ranking title which also seem to have some authority over the Littlest Chickadees patrol in the story &quot;The Chickadee Challenge&quot; (Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories #181) written and drawn by Carl Barks, by declaring the bridge-building challenge between the two organisations as a tie; suggesting that the Littlest Chickadees is somehow part of or associated with the Junior Woodchuck of the World in some way.

On few occasions Donald Duck has taken on the role as a troop commander (although in Don Rosa&#x27;s story &quot;W.H.A.D.A.L.O.T.T.A.J.A.R.G.O.N.&quot;, Donald is revealed to never having been allowed to join the Junior Woodchucks on account of his &quot;hot temper&quot;), or by Launchpad McQuack in the &quot;DuckTales&quot; TV series. In a large number of stories, including the last ones written by Carl Barks, the Duckburg troop commander is a tall duck, who is either the same character in every story with many different titles depending on the situation or separate characters. In some Italian stories the troop commander of the Duckburg troop is a tall, brave, strong, healthy and wise (but scared of flight) goose whose name is Bertie McGoose.

===Troops===
To become a full member of the Junior Woodchucks and be assigned to a local troop one must first enlist as cadets, who wears woodchuck caps, and pass the initiation test that proves one&#x27;s intelligence and resourcefulness. After one has passed this test and become a full member, the headgear of the uniform consist of a backtail woodchuck cap and for higher-ranking members; the Exalted Hightail woodchuck cap. Within the troops there is also leadership titles inspired by the army, in which Major seems to be the lowest rank followed by higher ranking titles like Ten-Star General; which is one grade below Exalted Hightail. Don Rosa has written that One-Hundred-Star General is the highest title in the Junior Woodchucks; after which promotees can proceed to earn titles above the highest ranks. Recipients can issue orders to lower ranking members. To earn titles and get promotions in rank, one will have to pass tests or missions of which there is a vast number and in various fields. These include outdoors and survival skills, science and environmental protection etc. With these promotions, Junior Woodchucks will receive a large number of elaborately honorific medals, badges &amp; ribbons in the specific field that one has mastered. All the different troops also has its own lodge as a base of operation and for gatherings. The most prestigious troop to belong to was the Duckburg Troop No. 1, as it was the first to be created during the time of Clinton Coot and it only admitted high-ranking members from other local troops.

The best known members of the Duckburg Troop Nr. 1 consist of: 
* Ten-Star Generals/ Exalted Hightails, Commandants of the Hightails&#x27; Hall of Heroes, Chevaliers of the Honor Guard (etc.) Huey, Dewey and Louie Duck
* Field Marshal Fox
* Trooper Hogg, a character together with Field Marshal Fox most often appears in Carl Barks&#x27; later Junior Woodchucks stories and also in the modern stories by later writers and artists. 
* Lieutenant-General Holsworthy Hog, appears in &quot;Gladstone&#x27;s Usual Very Good Year&quot; (Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories #136), by Carl Barks.

===General Snozzie===
General Snozzie is the Official Hound of the Junior Woodchucks and was created by Carl Barks in his story &quot;Dodging Miss Daisy&quot; from 1958. General Snozzie is a bloodhound occasionally deployed by the Junior Woodchucks during tests or missions and he has many skills but his main attribute and discipline is his extraordinary, and at times incomprehensibly, good scent tracking. He also has a number of acronymized titles which include:Ph.D., B.Sc., Ed.D. and D.O.G. (Doctor of Odd-ball Gimmickry) and G.C.O.T.O.O.M. (Grand Commander Of The Order Of Mercury)(1961), S.L.O.B. (Simple, Lowdown, Ordinary Boobhound), S.S.S.S. and S.O.S.S. (Supremely Sagacious Spoor Sniffer and Saver Of Stranded Souls)(1962), K.I.N.G. (Knightly, Intrepid, Natatorial Guardian) &quot;working for points to earn a&quot; B.T.H.H.M. (Bucket To Hold His Medals) and G.P.O.O.T.K.H. (Great Peerless Overseer Of The Kitchen Help)(1963).

==The Littlest Chickadees==
The Littlest Chickadees, sometimes also called the &quot;Chickadee Patrols&quot;, are female counterparts to the Junior Woodchucks. The Chickadees first appeared in &quot;The Chickadee Challenge,&quot; a Carl Barks Donald Duck story in &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; #161 (1954). The Chickadees&#x27; Duckburg patrol is led by a brawny woman named Captain Ramrod. Daisy Duck&#x27;s nieces April, May, and June are members of the Chickadees. The Chickadees are named after the chickadee, a species of small bird; the phrase &quot;littlest chickadee&quot; also suggests &quot;my little chickadee&quot;, a term of endearment classically used by W. C. Fields.

The Chickadee Patrols are based to some extent on the Girl Scouts of the USA and the Campfire Girls. In the spirit of friendly rivalry, the Duckburg Troops of the Littlest Chickadees and Junior Woodchucks once held a bridge-building competition, which ended in a tie.

Carl Barks wrote a poem which mentions the rivalry between the two groups:

&quot;The world is full of clans and cults&quot;
&quot;Abuzz as angry bees&quot;
&quot;And Junior Woodchucks snapping jeers&quot;
&quot;At Littlest Chickadees&quot;

==The Little Booneheads==
The Little Booneheads is another Scouting organization alongside the Junior Woodchucks, first mentioned in &quot;Ten-Stars Generals&quot; (Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories #132, 1951) by Carl Barks. They are however often depicted to be much less self-sufficient, and at times even negligent, in their outdoors and survival skills in contrast to the high standards of the Junior Woodchucks. In the Little Booneheads first appearance, it was revealed that Donald Duck was a former member, and thanks to the organization&#x27;s inferior training, Donald is often getting into trouble for practicing them again. Alongside being a pun of the term &quot;bonehead&quot;, the Little Booneheads is also a reference to the pioneer and explorer Daniel Boone; as Donald proclaims: &quot;We had heads like Daniel Boone!&quot;.

==In animation==
===Early prototype===
Huey, Dewey and Louie first appeared as scouts in the 1938 animated short, Good Scouts, written by Carl Barks. Here, the first prototype of a scouting uniform for the boys was designed, based on early Boy Scout uniforms. The uniforms from this time resembled National Park Service uniforms, with park ranger style hats, as seen in the film. The film did not show the trio wearing coonskin caps, a style that became popular with boys in the 1950s, nor mention a scouting organization that they belonged to. Donald acts like a wilderness know-it-all, yet keeps goofing up, as in numerous Woodchuck stories. The uniforms were introduced to the &quot;Donald Duck&quot; comic strip by Al Taliaferro and Bob Karp from model sheets while the film&#x27;s production was wrapping up. Thus, the first appearance of the boys in scout uniforms was introduced in the comics three months before the animated release.

===&quot;DuckTales&quot;===
The Junior Woodchucks and their guidebook were a frequent plot element in the original &quot;DuckTales&quot; animated series.

In the 2017 &quot;DuckTales&quot; reboot, Huey is the only nephew who is a member of the Junior Woodchucks. Though it sometimes feeds into his vices of overplanning and hunger for approval, he is an enthusiastic scout. he has earned multiple merit badges and keeps his copy of the guidebook under his cap, adding new entries to it as he encounters various supernatural entities or artifacts. Launchpad McQuack also serves as a Junior Woodchuck scoutmaster. Other Junior Woodchucks include Violet Sabrewing, Doofus Drake, and B.O.Y.D., while former Woodchucks include Fethry Duck, Della Duck, and Donald Duck, though Donald was kicked out because he has a &quot;bad attitude towards nature&quot;. In season three, it is revealed that this iteration of the Junior Woodchucks was founded by renowned adventurer Isabella Finch and her grandson Bradford Buzzard, founder and director of F.O.W.L., was the first Woodchuck.

==Cultural impact==
In the 1970s Bob Rozakis called his fellow young fans turned DC Comics editorial employees Junior Woodchucks and they referred to themselves as such in the pages of the pro-zine &quot;The Amazing World of DC Comics&quot; which they co-edited.

Comedian Jeff Foxworthy once claimed, in his TV show, to have been a member of the Junior Woodchucks in his childhood.

In Season 9, Episode 12 of original Night Court, titled, &quot;A Shave and a Haircut&quot; (at timestamp 8:40-8:50), Mel Torme accepts a &quot;Junior Woodchuck of the Year Award&quot; from two young boys in scouting gear. When he says goodbye to them he refers to them as &quot;Two, with it, chuck-a-duck ducks.&quot; Which might be a further hint at the Woodchuck&#x27;s Donald Duck origin. 

In some episodes of the comic strip &quot;Big Nate&quot;, Nate Wright and his middle-school friends are members of the Junior Woodchucks.

In the 2012 Former Fat Boys song &quot;Snakes on a Plane 2: Sharks on a Rollercoaster&quot;, the lyric &quot;Junior Woodchuck for life&quot; is present and can be heard at the 1:54 second mark (3:00 mark if listening to the version with the intro included).

<text>The Pied Piper is a 1942 American film in which an Englishman on vacation in France is caught up in the German invasion of that country, and finds himself taking an ever-growing group of children to safety. It stars Monty Woolley, Roddy McDowall and Anne Baxter. The film was adapted by Nunnally Johnson from the 1942 novel of the same name by Nevil Shute. It was directed by Irving Pichel.

It was nominated for Academy Award for Best Picture, Monty Woolley for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and Edward Cronjager for Best Cinematography, Black-and-White.

==Plot==
In June 1940, Howard goes to France, near the border with Switzerland, to sulk after his offer to serve in the Second World War is turned down by every government department in London because he is too old. (It is later revealed that his son, a Royal Air Force pilot, was shot down and killed two months earlier.) When Germany invades France, he is determined to go home. Mrs. Cavanaugh decides to accompany her husband, a League of Nations official, to his post in Geneva, but fearing that the Germans will invade Switzerland next, she asks Howard to take her two young children, Ronnie and Sheila, to her sister in Plymouth. Howard reluctantly agrees, as he does not like children, especially Ronnie, who annoys him by contradicting his claim that Rochester is an American state.

They take the train from St. Claude, but have to debark at Joigny. When they board a bus to Chartres, Ronnie, without Howard&#x27;s knowledge, brings along the French girl Rose (at her aunt&#x27;s request) to take to her father in London, much to Howard&#x27;s annoyance. As they near Chartres, German airplanes attack the stream of refugees on the road. They start walking. When they stop for the night, Howard discovers they have acquired a young boy named Pierre. He was a fellow bus passenger, but his parents were killed in the aerial attack.

They reach Chartres, just before the Germans seize the city. When Howard seeks help from his acquaintance Nicole Rougeron, he finds he now has five charges, the newest addition being Willem, a Dutch boy. Nicole takes them away just before the Germans, tipped off that there is an Englishman there, search the Rougeron home. They board a train to the Brittany coast. On the way, Nicole reveals to Howard that she spent three blissful days with his son.

In Landerneau, Nicole appeals to her uncle Aristide, who owns fishing boats. Initially suspicious, he finds a man, Focquet, willing to take them to England. However, on their way through the German-occupied town, Sheila gets into a fight with Rose and speaks English within earshot of a German soldier. They are all captured at the boat and taken to Major Diessen.

Diessen is certain Howard is working for British Army intelligence, using the children as a cover. He has Howard watch the execution of a spy. Howard offers to confess to anything Diessen wants if he will release the others. Finally, Diessen makes him a totally unexpected private proposal. He will release everyone, including Howard, if he will take another child with him, his seven-year-old niece. Her father, Diessen&#x27;s younger brother, was killed in Belgium, and the Nazis discovered his wife was Jewish. The woman has been dealt with, but Diessen wants to save the child by having her taken to his older brother, a naturalized American citizen living in ... Rochester. Just in case, Diessen will keep an eye on Nicole, who refuses to leave France. Howard counters by threatening to reveal Diessen&#x27;s dealings with him if Nicole is harmed.

Later, safely home, Howard is asked at his club if he &quot;had much difficulty getting back?&quot; He replies, &quot;No ... not too much.&quot;

===Fawcett Comics===
In 1933, Beck joined Fawcett Publications as a staff artist, where he created pulp magazines. When the company began producing comic books in autumn 1939, Beck was assigned to draw a character created by writer Bill Parker called &quot;Captain Thunder&quot;. Before the first issue of &quot;Whiz Comics&quot; came out, the character&#x27;s name was changed to Captain Marvel. Besides Captain Marvel, Beck also drew other Fawcett series, including the adventures of Spy Smasher and Ibis the Invincible.

His early Captain Marvel stories set the style for the series. Beck favored a cartoony versus realistic rendering of character and setting, which also came to be reflected in the whimsical scripting (by Otto Binder and others). The Captain Marvel stories boasted a clean style which facilitated Beck&#x27;s assistants and other Fawcett artists emulating Beck&#x27;s style (one exception was Mac Raboy whose work on Captain Marvel, Jr. was more in the style of Alex Raymond). While Beck oversaw the visual aspects of the various comics featuring Captain Marvel, he emphatically stated in an interview with Tom Heintjes published in &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Alley&quot; #3 that he and his fellow artists had no input or influence on the scripts they illustrated, noting &quot;In the 13 years I spent drawing Captain Marvel, I wrote only one story, about Billy&#x27;s trip to a Mayan temple [&quot;Whiz Comics&quot; 22, &quot;Capt. Marvel and the Temple of Itzalotahui&quot;], which had to be submitted in typed form and edited and approved before I was allowed to illustrate it.&quot; At most he allowed the art and editorial departments &quot;did develop an interplay of ideas ... that kept Captain Marvel changing and developing.&quot;

The popularity of Captain Marvel allowed Fawcett to produce a number of spin-off comic books and Beck to open his own New York City comics studio in 1941. He later expanded his studio, adding one in Englewood, New Jersey. Beck&#x27;s studio supplied most of the artwork in the Marvel Family line of books. In this he acted as Chief Artist (akin to an art director), a role Fawcett formally recognized on the contents page of &quot;Captain Marvel Adventures&quot;. This facilitated Beck&#x27;s efforts to bring a coherent look to the stories with Captain Marvel and related characters, ensuring they adhered to the style he originated. The studio also did commercial art, most prominently a series of advertisements in comic strip form starring Captain Tootsie promoting Tootsie Roll. Done in the style of the Marvel Family books and similarly whimsical (this Captain had a large T on his shirt instead of a lightning bolt), the ads appeared in comic books published by both Fawcett and its rivals, and in Sunday comic strip sections of newspapers.

After years of litigation due to a suit lodged by National Comics Publications (one of the companies that would later become DC Comics) against Fawcett for copyright infringement claiming that Captain Marvel was a copy of Superman (see &quot;National Comics Publications, Inc. v. Fawcett Publications, Inc.&quot;), Fawcett in the early 1950s (partly in response to flagging sales) reached a settlement with DC in which it agreed to discontinue its comic line.

===Later work===

After Fawcett Comics folded, Beck left the comic book industry but continued doing commercial illustrations. With Otto Binder, Beck prepared six sample strips for a proposed newspaper comic strip starring the character Tawky Tawny but it was rejected by the syndicates that saw it. By 1953, Beck had relocated to Florida and owned the Ukulele Bar &amp; Grill in Miami, Florida, where he tended bar. That year he contacted Joe Simon and expressed a desire to re-enter the comic book industry and sought Simon&#x27;s aid in creating a suitable character. The result was The Silver Spider, with Beck doing rough art from a script by Jack Oleck; Simon used his connections to pitch the property to Harvey Comics but they rejected it. Several years later, in 1959, Simon and Jack Kirby re-worked the Silver Spider concept for publication by Archie Comics as &quot;The Fly&quot;.

Beck had a short story titled &quot;Vanishing Point&quot; published in the July 1959 issue of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;.

His first return to comics was in the mid-1960s for the short-lived Milson Publications who published three issues of his creation Fatman the Human Flying Saucer. This character was almost the inverse of Captain Marvel in appearance and coloration, but with very different powers. Then in 1973 he was the initial artist for DC Comics&#x27; revival of Captain Marvel, titled &quot;Shazam!&quot; due to trademark issues. Beck left after the tenth issue due to &quot;creative differences&quot; regarding plotlines. Subsequently, at the invitation of E. Nelson Bridwell, Beck submitted a script for a new story &quot;Captain Marvel Battles Evil Incarnate.&quot; After Bridwell returned it with extensive editorial changes Beck attempted to draw the rewritten version but became so dissatisfied with it that he tore up the artwork he had drawn thus far and returned the Bridwell draft to DC.

In his retirement, Beck produced a regular opinion column for &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; entitled &quot;The Crusty Curmudgeon&quot;. One of his chief topics was his objections to what he saw as the growing realism in comics art (versus the simpler style he had employed). In the early 1970s, he tutored the filmmaker and special effects artist John R. Ellis.

Beck was guest of honor at the 1973 Comic Art Convention and the 1977 San Diego Comic Book Convention, memorably at the latter he in the evening played guitar serenading fans and guests poolside at the El Cortez Hotel. Beck attended the initial OrlandoCon in 1974 and was a regular attendee into the early 1980s. He was also a guest at the 1982 Minneapolis Comic-Con.

Beck in his later years began doing paintings recreating the covers of Golden Age comic books, both those featuring Captain Marvel and other superheroes and even some of funny animals (Donald Duck, Bugs Bunny). Beck&#x27;s painting inspired by Carl Barks&#x27;s unused cover sketch for the story &quot;The Mines of King Solomon&quot; (&quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; #19, Sept.–Nov. 1957) was used as the cover when the story was reprinted in &quot;Gladstone Comic Album&quot; #1 (1987).

In April 1980 Beck became the editor of the newsletter of the Fawcett Collectors of America, which he renamed FCA/SOB for Fawcett Collectors of America/Some Opinionated Bastards (the latter phrase humorously referring to himself). Failing health forced Beck to resign the editorship after nineteen issues (Newsletter #30, dated May/June 1983).

Beck died in Gainesville, Florida of a renal ailment.

==Awards==
Beck was recognized for his work with a formal nomination as a finalist for the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1990, and induction in 1997. He was also inducted into the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 1993. In 1977 he was awarded an Inkpot by San Diego Comic-Con.

<doc id="77639" wikidata="Q1198860" url="?curid=77639" title="The Pride of the Yankees">
<text>The Pride of the Yankees is a 1942 American sports drama film produced by Samuel Goldwyn, directed by Sam Wood, and starring Gary Cooper, Teresa Wright, and Walter Brennan. It is a tribute to the legendary New York Yankees first baseman Lou Gehrig, who died a year before its release, at age 37, from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which later became known to the lay public as &quot;Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease&quot;.

Though subtitled The Life of Lou Gehrig, the film is less a sports biography than an homage to a heroic and widely loved sports figure whose tragic and premature death touched the entire nation. It emphasizes Gehrig&#x27;s relationship with his parents (particularly his strong-willed mother), his friendships with players and journalists, and his storybook romance with the woman who became his &quot;companion for life&quot;, Eleanor Twitchell. Details of his baseball career—which were still fresh in most fans&#x27; minds in 1942—are limited to montages of ballparks, pennants, and Cooper swinging bats and running bases, though Gehrig&#x27;s best-known major league record—2,130 consecutive games played—is prominently cited.

Yankee teammates Babe Ruth, Bob Meusel, Mark Koenig, and Bill Dickey play themselves, as does sportscaster Bill Stern. The film was adapted by Herman J. Mankiewicz, Jo Swerling, and an uncredited Casey Robinson from a story by Paul Gallico, and received 11 Oscar nominations. It ends with a re-enactment of Gehrig&#x27;s poignant 1939 farewell speech at Yankee Stadium. The film&#x27;s iconic closing line—&quot;Today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the Earth&quot;—was voted 38th on the American Film Institute&#x27;s list of 100 greatest movie quotes. The film was also ranked 22nd on AFI&#x27;s list of most inspiring movies. In 2024, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
Lou Gehrig is a young Columbia University student whose old-fashioned mother wants him to study hard and become an engineer, but the young man has a gift for baseball. A sportswriter befriends Gehrig and persuades a scout to come see him play. When his mother gets sick, Gehrig signs with the team he has always revered, the New York Yankees, to pay for the hospital bills. With the help of his father, he endeavors to keep his career change a secret from his mother.

Gehrig works his way up through the minor leagues and joins the Yankees. His hero, Babe Ruth, is at first condescending and dismissive of the rookie, but his strong, consistent play wins over Ruth and the rest of the team. Gehrig is unknowingly included by his teammates in playing pranks on Ruth on the team train.

During a game at Comiskey Park, Gehrig trips over a stack of bats and is teased by a spectator, Eleanor (the daughter of the ballpark hot dog magnate), who laughingly calls him &quot;tanglefoot&quot;. Later, they are properly introduced, leading to a relationship, and then an engagement. Gehrig&#x27;s mother, who still has not accepted the fact that her son will not be an engineer, does not take this news well; Gehrig finally stands up to her, and marries Eleanor.

The Yankees become the dominant team in baseball, and Gehrig becomes a fan favorite. His father and fully converted mother attend games and cheer for him. In a re-creation of a famous (and possibly apocryphal) story, Gehrig visits a crippled boy named Billy in a hospital. He promises to hit two home runs in a single World Series game in the boy&#x27;s honor—then fulfills his promise.

Gehrig is now the &quot;Iron Horse&quot;, a national hero at the peak of his career with multitudes of fans, many loyal friends, and an adoring wife. Then he begins to notice, with growing alarm, that his strength is slowly ebbing away. Though he continues to play, and extends his consecutive-game streak to a seemingly insurmountable record, his physical condition continues its inexorable decline. One day, in Detroit, he tells Yankees manager Joe McCarthy that he has become a detriment to the team and benches himself. After an examination, a doctor gives him the awful news: Gehrig has a rare, incurable disease, and only a short time to live.

A short time later, on Lou Gehrig Day at Yankee Stadium, an older Billy finds Gehrig and shows him that he has made a full recovery, inspired by his hero&#x27;s example and the two-homer fulfilled promise. Then, as Eleanor weeps softly in the stands, Gehrig addresses the fans: &quot;People all say that I&#x27;ve had a bad break. But today ... today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the Earth.&quot;

==Production==
Samuel Goldwyn displayed little interest in Sam Wood&#x27;s initial proposal to make a movie tribute to Gehrig, as he had no knowledge of or interest in baseball. In addition, conventional Hollywood wisdom dictated that sports pictures were box-office poison, as women, who made up more than half the audience and made most movie-going decisions, did not like them. After Wood screened newsreel footage of Gehrig&#x27;s famous &quot;luckiest man&quot; speech, however, Goldwyn—with tears in his eyes—agreed to produce the picture.

In a 1941 press campaign publicizing plans for the film, RKO Pictures announced a major talent hunt for Gehrig&#x27;s portrayer, but Goldwyn and Wood reportedly never considered casting anyone but Cooper in the title role. Although he was ideally suited to the part due to his physical resemblance to Gehrig and the quiet strength and masculine appeal that he projected, Cooper was reluctant to accept it because he, like Goldwyn, had no interest in baseball. By one account, he had never watched a game nor even swung a bat prior to taking the role. Another problem was Cooper&#x27;s age (41), particularly in scenes involving Gehrig as a young man. Cinematographer Rudolph Maté lighted Cooper from below during those early scenes to conceal lines and wrinkles, then gradually reduced and finally eliminated the lighting effect as the story progressed.

Another important (and problematic) casting decision was Babe Ruth, as himself. Ruth&#x27;s health had been declining steadily since his retirement in 1935, and by 1942 he weighed nearly 270 pounds. He was put on a strict diet to achieve a presentable weight before filming began. This rapid weight loss, on the heels of a heart attack followed by a car accident, combined with the tough shooting schedule and Ruth&#x27;s propensity to keep late hours, weakened him significantly. By the time filming wrapped, he had developed pneumonia severe enough to require a period of hospitalization.

Multiple published sources have asserted that Cooper, who was right-handed, could not master a convincing left-handed swing. To remedy the problem, the story went, he was filmed wearing a mirror-image uniform and swinging from the right side of the plate, then running to third base instead of first; technicians then purportedly flopped the print of the film. Tom Shieber, Senior Curator at the National Baseball Hall of Fame, has shown, however, that Cooper did indeed learn to bat left-handed, and never wore a backwards Yankees uniform nor ran to third base after swinging. Film footage was, in fact, flopped only once, during a brief sequence portraying Gehrig&#x27;s minor league days at Hartford, in order to make Cooper appear to be throwing left-handed — a far more difficult task for a right-hander to master. (&quot;[Cooper] threw the ball like an old woman tossing a hot biscuit,&quot; said Lefty O&#x27;Doul, who tried unsuccessfully to teach him a convincing left-handed throw.) Scenes requiring Cooper to throw a ball as a Yankee were filmed using his stand-in, the left-handed Babe Herman.

Scenes purporting to depict Yankee Stadium, Comiskey Park, and other ballparks were all filmed at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles, home of the Los Angeles Angels of the old Pacific Coast League, and a popular venue for baseball movies of the era, as well as the &quot;Home Run Derby&quot; television series.

==Acknowledgment in opening credits==
&quot;Appreciation is expressed for the gracious assistance of Mrs. Lou Gehrig and for the cooperation of Mr. Ed Barrow and the New York Yankees arranged by Christy Walsh.&quot;

===Foreword===
&quot;This is the story of a hero of the peaceful paths of everyday life. It is the story of a gentle young man who, in the full flower of his great fame, was a lesson in simplicity and modesty to the youth of America. He faced death with that same valor and fortitude that has been displayed by thousands of young Americans on far-flung fields of battle. He left behind him a memory of courage and devotion that will ever be an inspiration to all men. This is the story of Lou Gehrig.&quot; – Damon Runyon

==Release==

Gehrig died on June 2, 1941. The film premiered on July 14, 1942, in New York City at the Astor Theatre, and was shown for one night only at &quot;forty neighborhood theatres&quot;. Preceding the film was the premiere of an animated short called &quot;How to Play Baseball&quot;, produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios at Goldwyn&#x27;s request.

==Reception==

===Critical===
&quot;Variety&quot; magazine called the film a &quot;stirring epitaph&quot; and a &quot;sentimental, romantic saga ... well worth seeing.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine said the film was a &quot;grade-A love story&quot; done with &quot;taste and distinction&quot; though it was &quot;somewhat overlong, repetitive, undramatic. Baseball fans who hope to see much baseball played in &quot;Pride of the Yankees&quot; will be disappointed. Babe Ruth is there, playing himself with fidelity and considerable humor; so are Yankees Bill Dickey, Bob Meusel, Mark Koenig. But baseball is only incidental. The hero does not hit a home run and win the girl. He is just a hardworking, unassuming, highly talented professional. The picture tells the model story of his model life in the special world of professional ballplayers.&quot; Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it a &quot;tender, meticulous and explicitly narrative film&quot; that &quot;inclines to monotony&quot; because of its length and devotion to &quot;genial details&quot;.

===Box office===
&quot;The Pride of the Yankees&quot; was among the top ten box office films of 1942, earning $3,332,000 in theater rentals from the United States and Canada and an additional $855,000 from foreign rentals. Despite its wide popularity, RKO took a loss of $213,000 on the film due to the small distribution fee that Samuel Goldwyn had negotiated with the studio. All of Goldwyn&#x27;s pictures produced a loss for RKO no matter how much money they took in; but the studio considered the arrangement acceptable, because its association with Goldwyn lent prestige to RKO, and enhanced sales of its own movies.

==Awards and other recognition==

Film Editor Daniel Mandell won an Academy Award for his work on &quot;The Pride of the Yankees&quot;. The film received ten additional Oscar nominations:

* Best Actor in a Leading Role (Cooper)
* Best Actress in a Leading Role (Wright)
* Best Art Direction-Interior Decoration, Black-and-White
* Best Cinematography, Black-and-White
* Best Effects, Special Effects (Jack Cosgrove, Ray Binger, Thomas T. Moulton)
* Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture
* Best Picture
* Best Sound Recording (Thomas T. Moulton)
* Best Writing, Original Story
* Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay

In the American Film Institute&#x27;s 2008 list &quot;Ten Top Tens&quot;—the top ten films in ten &quot;classic&quot; American film genres—&quot;The Pride of the Yankees&quot; was ranked third in the sports category. The film was also ranked 22nd in AFI&#x27;s 2006 100 Years...100 Cheers list of most inspirational movies. Gehrig was named the 25th greatest hero in American cinema by the AFI in 2003.

==Inaccuracies/artistic license==
As the film opens, Gehrig is depicted belting a home run through a window of the Columbia University athletic building. That building is actually located on the north end of campus, well away from the baseball field; his farthest hits most likely smashed through the windows of a nearby building housing the School of Journalism.

In the film, Gehrig hits two home runs in a World Series game against the St. Louis Cardinals where Babe Ruth also homers. This never occurred against the Cardinals, but did happen in Game 3 of the 1932 World Series versus the Cubs.

In the film, Gehrig meets Eleanor Twitchell early in his career and marries her shortly after his first World Series. Actually the two met in 1931, well after Gehrig was an established star. They were married in 1933.

In the scene where Eleanor looks through Lou&#x27;s scrapbook, a newspaper clipping about Babe Ruth leaving the Yankees has a September 1935 date. Ruth last played for the Yankees in 1934. He had started the 1935 season as a Boston Brave, but he retired in late May.

In one of the film&#x27;s more memorable scenes, a physician matter-of-factly informs Gehrig of his tragic diagnosis, dismal prognosis, and brief life expectancy. In fact, Mayo Clinic doctors painted an unrealistically optimistic picture of Gehrig&#x27;s condition and prospects, reportedly at his wife&#x27;s request. Among other things he was given &quot;a 50–50 chance of keeping me as I am&quot; for the foreseeable future, and was told that he &quot;...may need a cane in 10 or 15 years.&quot; Deliberate concealment of bad news from patients, particularly when cancer or an incurable degenerative disease was involved, was a relatively common practice at the time.

===Gehrig&#x27;s farewell speech===
There is no known intact film of Gehrig&#x27;s actual speech at Yankee Stadium on July 4, 1939; a small portion of the newsreel footage, incorporating his first and last remarks, is all that survives. For the movie, the speech was not reproduced verbatim; the script condensed and reorganized Gehrig&#x27;s actual spontaneous and unprepared remarks, and moved the iconic &quot;luckiest man&quot; line from the beginning to the end for heightened dramatic effect. Gehrig&#x27;s message remained essentially unchanged.

==Adaptations to other media==
&quot;The Pride of the Yankees&quot; was adapted as an hour-long radio play on the October 4, 1943, broadcast of &quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot; with Gary Cooper and Virginia Bruce and a September 30, 1949, broadcast of &quot;Screen Director&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; starring Gary Cooper and Lurene Tuttle.

<text>Laurence M. Janifer (born Laurence M. Harris; March 17, 1933 – July 10, 2002) was an American science fiction author, with a career spanning over 50 years.

==Biography==
Janifer was born in Brooklyn, New York with the surname of &quot;Harris&quot;, but in 1963 took the original surname of his Polish grandfather. Many of his early stories appeared under the &quot;Larry M. Harris&quot; byline.

Though his first published work was a short story in &quot;Cosmos&quot; magazine in 1953, his career as a writer can be said to have started in 1959 when he began writing for &quot;Astounding&quot; and &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot;. He co-wrote the first novel in the &quot;Psi-Power&quot; series: &quot;Brain Twister&quot;, written with Randall Garrett under the joint pseudonym Mark Phillips. The novel was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1960, and published in book form in 1962. Janifer&#x27;s best known work is the &quot;Survivor&quot; series, comprising five novels and many short stories. The series follows the career of Gerald Knave as he visits (and survives to tell the tale of) planets on the outskirts of the civilized galaxy.

In addition to his career as a novelist and short story author, Janifer was an editor for Scott Meredith Literary Agency; editor/managing editor of various detective and science fiction publications; film reviewer for several magazines; and a talented pianist.

<text>Random Harvest is a 1942 American romantic drama film based on the 1941 James Hilton novel of the same title, directed by Mervyn LeRoy. Claudine West, George Froeschel, and Arthur Wimperis adapted the novel for the screen, and received an Academy Award nomination. The novel keeps the true identity of Paula/Margaret a secret until the very end, something that would have been impossible in a film, where characters’ faces must be seen. This meant that the movie had to take a very different approach to the story. The film stars Ronald Colman as a shellshocked, amnesiac World War I veteran, and Greer Garson as his love interest.

The film was an instant commercial success and was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Actor for Colman, Best Supporting Actress for Susan Peters, Best Director for Mervyn LeRoy and Best Picture. Garson, whose performance was well-received, was nominated for and won the Academy Award for Best Actress that year for her role in &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot;.

==Plot==
In the last days of the First World War, a British officer who had been gassed in the trenches and lost his memory is confined to an English asylum as &quot;John Smith,&quot; an unidentified inmate. On the day the war ends, the asylum&#x27;s gatekeepers abandon their posts to join the celebration in the nearby Midlands town of Melbridge, and Smith wanders away.
In town, he is befriended by a singer with the stage name Paula Ridgeway. She guesses he is from the asylum, but as he seems harmless, she arranges for him to join her traveling theatrical group. After an incident that threatens to bring unwanted attention, Paula takes Smith to a secluded country village in Devon, where they stay at an inn run by Mrs. Deventer. They fall in love and marry, renting a small cottage and eventually having a son.

&quot;Smithy,&quot; as Paula calls him, discovers he has some literary talent. Paula remains home with their newborn son while Smithy goes to Liverpool for a job interview with a newspaper. He is struck by a taxi. When he regains consciousness, his past memory is restored, but his life with Paula is now forgotten. He is Charles Rainier, the son of a wealthy businessman. None of his meager possessions, including a key, provide any clue about where he has been. Charles returns home on the day of his father&#x27;s funeral. Kitty, the stepdaughter of one of Charles&#x27;s siblings, becomes infatuated with her &quot;uncle.&quot; Charles wants to return to college, but the mismanaged family business needs him, and he puts off his own desires to safeguard the jobs of his many employees and restore the family fortune. After a few years, a newspaper touts him as the &quot;Industrial Prince of England.&quot;

Meanwhile, Paula has been searching frantically for her Smithy. Their son died as an infant, and she now works as a secretary. One day, she sees Charles&#x27; picture and story in a magazine. Paula becomes his executive assistant under her real name, Margaret Hanson, hoping that her presence will jog his memory. Dr. Jonathan Benet, who works at the Melbridge asylum, is her confidant and admirer. He warns her that revealing her identity would only cause Charles to resent her.

As Kitty grows up, she sends Charles love letters, and they become engaged. However, a hymn that Kitty is considering for their wedding triggers a vague memory in Charles. Kitty, realizing he still loves someone else, sadly breaks off the engagement.
Margaret joins Charles in Liverpool, where he is trying one last time to piece together his lost years. They recover his old suitcase from a hotel&#x27;s lost and found, but he recognizes nothing. Charles is approached to stand for Parliament. After his election, in which Margaret provides invaluable assistance, he feels the need for a wife in his new role. He proposes to her, more as a business proposition than a romantic one, and she accepts. They become an ideal couple, at least to all outward appearances, with Margaret a perfect society hostess. They discuss his lost past, and she tells him of her own lost love, without revealing that it is him. He hopes their life together can fill the void they both feel.

After three years of marriage, she decides to take an extended solo vacation abroad. Before her liner sails, she revisits the village where she and Smithy lived. Charles is summoned to mediate a strike at the Melbridge Cable Works. After the successful negotiation, he walks through the town, and the surroundings and celebrations begin to unlock his memories, leading him to the nearby village and the cottage he and Paula shared. Hesitantly, he tries the old key he kept; it unlocks the door. Margaret, about to leave for her boat, makes a casual remark to the innkeeper about her predecessor, Mrs. Deventer. The innkeeper tells her that a gentleman just that morning had inquired about Mrs. Deventer, and had mentioned that he used to rent a cottage near a church. Margaret hurries to the cottage and finds Charles at the front door. She tentatively calls out &quot;Smithy?&quot; Charles turns and recognises her. He rushes to embrace her, calling her Paula.

==Reception==
According to MGM records, the film earned $4,650,000 in the United States and $8,147,000 worldwide for a profit of $4,384,000, making it their biggest hit of the season.

The film played for a record 11 weeks at Radio City Music Hall in New York, a record that lasted until at least the 1960s.

Despite its box office success, critics were not impressed at the time. James Agee wrote, &quot;I would like to recommend this film to those who can stay interested in Ronald Colman&#x27;s amnesia for two hours and who can with pleasure eat a bowl of Yardley&#x27;s shaving soap for breakfast.&quot; In his &quot;New York Times&quot; review, Bosley Crowther was of the opinion that &quot;for all its emotional excess, &quot;Random Harvest&quot; is a strangely empty film.&quot; &quot;Miss Garson and Mr. Colman are charming; they act perfectly. But they never seem real.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; praised the performances of the two leads, in particular Garson, but noted that Colman seemed older than the role.

Decades later, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; allowed that it had &quot;a kind of deranged sincerity and integrity on its own terms&quot;. Leonard Maltin&#x27;s capsule review reads &quot;James Hilton novel given supremely entertaining MGM treatment, with Colman and Garson at their best.&quot; Hal Erickson wrote, &quot;Under normal circumstances, we wouldn&#x27;t believe a minute of &quot;Random Harvest&quot;, but the magic spell woven by the stars and by author James Hilton (&quot;Lost Horizon&quot;, &quot;Goodbye Mr. Chips&quot;, etc.) transforms the wildly incredible into the wholly credible.&quot;

The film was ranked 36th by the American Film Institute in its 2002 AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Passions list.

==In popular culture ==
This film is alluded to in the third season of British sitcom &quot;As Time Goes By&quot;. Lionel and Jean attend a meeting in Los Angeles about a script he has written, and co-executive creative consultants Josh and Lisa come up with a &quot;mangled version&quot; of &quot;Random Harvest&quot;, about &quot;Lionel being shot in the head every five minutes.&quot;

Several Indian films were influenced by this film: the Bengali film &quot;Harano Sur&quot; (1957), the Tamil film &quot;Amara Deepam&quot; (1956) and the Hindi film &quot;Amar Deep&quot; (1958).

In 1973, an episode of &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; featured a spoof of the film called &quot;Rancid Harvest&quot;, with Carol Burnett in Greer Garson&#x27;s role and Harvey Korman in Ronald Colman&#x27;s.

The 1980 blockbuster Pakistani film &quot;Bandish&quot;, starring Shabnam and Nadeem, was also inspired by this film. The music of the film was composed by Robin Ghosh, which went on to become some of the most renowned melodies of the decade in Pakistan.

==Music==
In 2006 &quot;Film Score Monthly&quot; released the majority of the film&#x27;s original score alongside Stothart&#x27;s score for &quot;The Yearling&quot; (1946) in the CD collection &quot;Random Harvest/The Yearling (1942/1946)&quot; limited to 3000 copies. Liner notes for both scores were provided by Marilee Bradford.

<text>The Talk of the Town is a 1942 American comedy-drama film directed by George Stevens and starring Cary Grant, Jean Arthur, and Ronald Colman, with a supporting cast featuring Edgar Buchanan and Glenda Farrell. The screenplay was written by Irwin Shaw and Sidney Buchman (adaptation by Dale Van Every) from a story by Sidney Harmon. The picture was released by Columbia Pictures. This was the second time that Grant and Arthur were paired in a film, after &quot;Only Angels Have Wings&quot; (1939).

==Plot==
Mill worker and political activist Leopold Dilg is accused of arson and murder, setting fire to a woolen mill, killing the mill foreman, Clyde Bracken. In the middle of the trial, Dilg escapes from jail and seeks shelter in a remote cottage owned by former schoolmate Nora Shelley, on whom he has had a crush for years. Shelley, now a schoolteacher, has rented the unoccupied cottage for the summer to distinguished law professor Michael Lightcap, who plans to use this secluded location to write a book. Both Lightcap and Dilg arrive within minutes of each other, so Shelley decides to hide Dilg in the attic.

When Dilg is spotted by Lightcap, Shelley passes him off as her gardener, Joseph. A visitor suddenly arrives, Senator Boyd. The senator informs Lightcap that he is about to be nominated to the Supreme Court by the president. Meanwhile, Lightcap and Dilg enjoy having spirited discussions about the law, Lightcap arguing from an academic viewpoint, with Dilg subscribing to a more practical approach. As a result of their spirited debates, they become good friends, but also romantic rivals, as Lightcap falls in love with Nora.

As a result of prodding by Shelley and Dilg&#x27;s lawyer, Lightcap becomes suspicious of mill owner Andrew Holmes, foreman Clyde Bracken and Regina Bush. In spite of his initial reluctance, Lightcap starts to investigate the charges against Dilg. As a ruse, he romances Bush, the girlfriend of the supposed murder victim and discovers that foreman Bracken is still alive and hiding in Boston. Shelley, Lightcap and Dilg go to Boston and find him. They bring him back to Lochester and get him to admit his guilt and that of the mill owner for setting the fire.

While the three argue about whether to call the police, Bracken catches them unawares, knocks them unconscious and escapes. Dilg is held for trial while the town&#x27;s anger at him is stoked into a riotous mob. Lightcap takes a gun from the cottage and seeks out the foreman, forcing him at gunpoint to go to the courthouse just as the mob is about to break in to lynch Dilg.

Firing the revolver to draw attention, Lightcap announces that the supposedly dead foreman is now present. He then gives an impassioned speech to the mob about the importance of the law, both in principle and in practice. In due course, the foreman and owner of the mill are indicted and Dilg is set free.

Soon afterwards Lightcap is appointed to the Supreme Court. Shelley visits him in his chambers and he tells her that his dream of 20 years has been realized. With more happiness than a man could want, he says the only thing left is to see his friends likewise happy, and suggests that Shelley should marry Dilg.

While both Dilg and Shelley are attending court at the first seating of Lightcap as an Associate Justice, Dilg interprets an affectionate look shared between Lightcap and Shelley as a sign that she has chosen to marry Lightcap, and leaves the courtroom abruptly. Shelley follows him, and Dilg eventually realises that she has chosen him.

==Production==
&quot;The Talk of the Town&quot; began with the working title &quot;Mr. Twilight&quot;, but Cary Grant insisted it be changed, suspecting that, if the movie appeared to be about a single male character, Colman, who had the better role, would steal the show.

While Grant was paid $106,250 for &quot;The Talk of the Town&quot; and Colman $100,000, Arthur earned only $50,000, partly as a result of ongoing conflict with studio head Harry Cohn.

The title &quot;The Talk of the Town&quot; was registered to Universal Studios, and Columbia had to give them the rights to use &quot;Sin Town&quot; in return. Other titles considered for the film included &quot;Three&#x27;s a Crowd&quot;, &quot;The Gentlemen Misbehave&quot;, &quot;Justice Winks an Eye&quot;, &quot;In Love with You&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Wonderful&quot;, &quot;A Local Affair&quot;, &quot;The Woman&#x27;s Touch&quot;, &quot;Morning for Angels&quot;, &quot;Scandal in Lochester&quot;, &quot;The Lochester Affair&quot;, and even &quot;Nothing Ever Happens&quot;.

Principal photography, originally scheduled to begin January 17, 1942, was delayed following news of the death of Carole Lombard in a plane crash while selling war bonds in the Midwest. Stevens, who had directed Lombard in the 1940 film, &quot;Vigil in the Night&quot;, halted work on the set and sent both cast and crew home.

The role of Colman&#x27;s valet, played by Rex Ingram, was at the time a rare example of a non-stereotypical part for an African-American actor. Also unusual was the presence of two leading men: at this point in their careers both Grant and Colman had been used to having that role all to themselves. The situation is reflected in the plot, since audiences are kept guessing until the end who Arthur&#x27;s character would choose to marry. Stevens filmed both versions, leaving it to test screenings to determine the ending.

Stevens and Arthur, both known for perfectionism and attention to detail, enjoyed a close working relationship on &quot;The Talk of the Town&quot;, with Arthur calling Stevens her &quot;favorite director&quot; and Stevens describing Arthur as &quot;the finest actress he ever worked with&quot;. They reunited on &quot;The More the Merrier&quot; (1943) and &quot;Shane&quot; (1953) − for which Arthur came out of semi-retirement.

===Critical assessments===
According to Bosley Crowther, &quot;the essential purpose of this tale is to amuse with some devious dilemmas, and that it does right well&quot;; he called the script &quot;smart and lively.&quot; The movie also premiered at the Radio City Music Hall. According to &quot;Variety&quot;, the film&#x27;s &quot;transition from serious or melodramatic to the slap-happy and humorous sometimes is a bit awkward, but in the main it is solid escapist comedy.&quot;

===Academy Awards nominations===

Screenwriter Sidney Buchman (who co-wrote the script with Irwin Shaw) was blacklisted in the 1950s. Consequently, Buchman, one of the men who penned &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; (1939), left the U.S. and began working in Fox&#x27;s European division. Buchman would remain in France until his death in 1975.

<text>Douglas Curtis Swan (February 17, 1920 – June 17, 1996) was an American comics artist. The artist most associated with Superman during the period fans call the Bronze Age of Comic Books, Swan produced hundreds of covers and stories from the 1950s through the 1980s.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Curt Swan was born in Minneapolis on February 17, 1920, the youngest of five children. Swan&#x27;s Swedish grandmother had shortened and Americanized the original family name of Svensson. Father John Swan worked for the railroads; mother Leontine Jessie Hanson had worked in a local hospital. As a boy, Swan&#x27;s given name – Douglas – was shortened to &quot;Doug,&quot; and, disliking the phonetic similarity to &quot;Dog,&quot; Swan thereafter reversed the order of his given names and went by &quot;Curtis Douglas,&quot; rather than &quot;Douglas Curtis.&quot;

Having enlisted in Minnesota&#x27;s National Guard&#x27;s 135th Regiment, 34th Division in 1940, Swan was sent to Europe when the &quot;federalized&quot; division was shipped initially to Northern Ireland and Scotland. While his comrades in the 34th eventually went into combat in North Africa and Italy, Swan spent most of World War II working as an artist for the G.I. magazine &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot;. While at &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot;, Swan met writer France Herron, who eventually directed him to DC Comics.

During this period Swan married the former Helene Brickley, whom he had met at a dance at Fort Dix, New Jersey, and who was stationed near him in Paris in 1944 as a Red Cross worker; they were married in Paris in April 1945. Shortly after returning to civilian life in 1945, he moved from Minnesota to New Jersey and began working for DC Comics. Apart from a few months of night classes at the Pratt Institute under the G.I. Bill, Swan was an entirely self-taught artist. After a stint on &quot;Boy Commandos&quot; he began to just pencil pages, leaving the inking to others.

===Superman===

Initially, Swan drew many different features, including &quot;Tommy Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Gangbusters&quot;, but slowly he began gravitating towards the Superman line of books. His first job pencilling the iconic character was for &quot;Superman&quot; #51 (March–April 1948). Many comics of the 1940s and 1950s lacked contributor credits, but research shows that Swan began pencilling the &quot;Superboy&quot; series with its fifth issue in 1949. He drew the first comics meeting of Superman and Batman in &quot;Superman&quot; #76 (May–June 1952). The two heroes began teaming on a regular basis in &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; #71 (July–August 1954) in a story which was also drawn by Swan. Swan always felt that his breakthrough came when he was assigned the art duties on &quot;Superman&#x27;s Pal, Jimmy Olsen&quot;, in 1954.

Swan didn&#x27;t take to line editor Mort Weisinger&#x27;s controlling style. Swan discussed this period in an interview: &quot;I was getting terrible migraine headaches and had these verbal battles with Mort. So it was emotional, physical. It just drained me and I thought I&#x27;d better get out of here before I go whacko.&quot; After leaving comics for the advertising world in 1951, Swan soon returned, for DC&#x27;s higher paychecks. And as biographer Eddy Zeno notes, &quot;The headaches went away after [Swan] gained Weisinger&#x27;s respect by standing up to him.&quot;

Around 1954, Swan unsuccessfully pitched an original comic strip for newspaper syndication. Called &quot;Yellow Hair&quot;, it was about a blond boy raised by Native Americans. A couple of years later, starting with the episode of June 18, 1956, Swan drew the &quot;Superman&quot; daily newspaper comic strip, which he continued on until November 12, 1960.

In the view of comics historian Les Daniels, Swan became the definitive artist of Superman in the early 1960s with a &quot;new look&quot; to the character that replaced Wayne Boring&#x27;s version. The Composite Superman was co-created by Swan and Edmond Hamilton in &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; #142 (June 1964). Swan and writer Jim Shooter crafted the story &quot;Superman&#x27;s Race with the Flash!&quot; in &quot;Superman&quot; #199 (August 1967) which featured the first race between the Flash and Superman, two characters known for their super-speed powers. Over the years, Swan was a remarkably consistent and prolific artist, often illustrating two or more titles per month. Swan remained as artist of &quot;Superman&quot; when Julius Schwartz became the editor of the title with issue #233 (January 1971), and writer Denny O&#x27;Neil streamlined the Superman mythos, starting with the elimination of Kryptonite. Among Swan&#x27;s contributions to the Superman mythos, he and writer Cary Bates co-created the supervillains Terra-Man and the 1970s version of the Toyman as well as the superhero Vartox. Writer Martin Pasko and Swan created the Master Jailer character in &quot;Superman&quot; #331 (January 1979).

===Later life and career===

After DC&#x27;s 1985 12-issue limited series &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; and with the impending 1986 revision of Superman by writer/artist John Byrne, Swan was released from his duties on the Superman comics. Critic Wallace Harrington summed up Swan&#x27;s dismissal this way:

Swan&#x27;s last work as regular artist on Superman was the non-canonical 1986 story &quot;&quot;, written by Alan Moore.

After this, Swan continued to do occasional minor projects for DC, including the artwork of what is thought to be one of the rarest Superman comics ever published, titled &quot;This Island Bradman&quot; (written by David P. Levin), a comic book that was privately commissioned in 1988 by real estate tycoon Godfrey Bradman as a Bar Mitzvah gift for his son, as well as an Aquaman limited series and special in 1989, and various returns on illustrating Superman, including the prestige format graphic novel one-shot &quot;Superman: The Earth Stealers&quot; in 1988.

In 1995, Swan did four illustrations for &quot;Penthouse Comix&quot; for the Larry Niven essay &quot;Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex,&quot; which detailed the problems that Superman would face in having sexual intercourse and reproducing with a human woman, using arguments based on humorous yet logical reconciliations between physics, biology, and the abilities of Kryptonians as presented in the Superman comic books.

Swan&#x27;s swan song was five pages published posthumously in the 1996 special &quot;&quot;.

Swan died June 17, 1996, in Wilton, Connecticut. Helene Swan died at the age of 91 on January 27, 2012.

A previously unpublished story featuring Swan&#x27;s art debuted in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1000.

==Art style==
Comics historian Arlen Schumer praised Swan&#x27;s ability to depict &quot;the spectrum of human emotion, from agony to anger, mournful to mirthful.&quot; As characterized by critic Paul Gravett, Swan&#x27;s Superman made &quot;...Krypton&#x27;s last son in exile, the alien in our midst, into someone like us, who would think and feel as well as act, who was approachable, big-hearted, considerate, maybe physically superpowerful yet gentle, noble yet subtly tragic.&quot; In a similar vein, Swan biographer Eddy Zeno calls Swan &quot;the Norman Rockwell of ... comics.&quot; Gary Groth, the editor-in-chief of &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;, was less complimentary, remarking that &quot;Swan is symptomatic of what the industry requires. They adore Swan at DC because they give Swan a script and it says &#x27;Superman flies out the window&#x27;...and there&#x27;s Superman flying out the window. The script says &#x27;Clark Kent walking down the hall&#x27; and there&#x27;s Clark Kent walking down a hall. He&#x27;s just a technician who does exactly what&#x27;s required of him.&quot;

With his frequent inker Murphy Anderson from 1970 to 1974 and 1988 to 1989, the pair&#x27;s collaborative artwork came to be called &quot;Swanderson&quot; by the fans. Despite his and Anderson&#x27;s success together, Swan&#x27;s favorite inker was Al Williamson, with whom he only worked for a short time, from 1985 to 1986.

==Legacy==
In 1985, DC Comics named Swan as one of the honorees in the company&#x27;s 50th anniversary publication &quot;Fifty Who Made DC Great&quot;.

Swan&#x27;s favorite story – one of the few he both pencilled and inked – was &quot;I Flew with Superman&quot; from &quot;Superman Annual&quot; #9 (1983), in which Swan himself appears and helps Superman solve a case.

In a story titled &quot;Swan&#x27;s Way&quot;, issue #92 of the &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; (May 1997) memorialized Swan with a cameo appearance as an art teacher.

<text>Wake Island is a 1942 American action drama war film directed by John Farrow, written by W. R. Burnett and Frank Butler, and starring Brian Donlevy, Robert Preston, Macdonald Carey, Albert Dekker, Barbara Britton, and William Bendix. The film tells the story of the United States military garrison on Wake Island and the onslaught by the Japanese following the attack on Pearl Harbor.

&quot;Wake Island&quot; was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Outstanding Motion Picture.

The film shows how the Marines, after being pounded for days by Japanese aircraft, caught the Japanese invaders by complete surprise by unleashing a wall of fire that stopped their first attempt to land on the island. The next attack was successful, in part because communications among the Marines had been cut, leading the Marine commander to believe his three hundred men were being slaughtered by the more than three thousand Japanese invaders. Because of their fierce defense of the island and because a Japanese cruiser was sunk, Marines were beheaded on the way to Japan to work as slaves in the mines there.

==Plot==
A map is shown with a voiceover giving a brief history of the United States military on Wake Island to November 1941. U.S. Marine Corps Major Geoffrey Caton departs Pearl Harbor naval base in Hawaii aboard the Pan American Clipper to take over command on Wake Island. A military contractor, Mr. McClosky, is also going there. The two clash during the flight.

Upon arrival, Caton inspects the island and identifies Privates Randall and Doyle as troublemakers. He has them dig a large slit trench by hand. McClosky has a construction contract for large trenches and living quarters, and drives his crew to complete the work on time. There are numerous conflicts between the military and the civilians, including practicing for air raids.

The next day is Sunday, December 7, 1941. Randall&#x27;s enlistment is up, and he prepares to board the Clipper. Then news arrives about the Japanese air attack on Pearl Harbor. The island goes on alert. Randall is unsure what to do. He is sent to a bomb shelter with the civilians, as enemy planes approach. The Americans have only four fighters in the air, holding eight in reserve, against 24 Japanese bombers. Marine fighters shoot down several Japanese planes, but the bombers inflict heavy damage. Following the raid, Caton tells Randall he is no longer a civilian. McClosky decides to stay and dig trenches and other shelters with his heavy equipment. That night, Caton informs pilot Lieutenant Bruce Cameron that his wife was killed at Pearl Harbor.

The next day, enemy ships approach. The Marines camouflage their equipment. Caton orders his men into shelters and to hold their fire while the Japanese bombard the island. The Japanese signal the Americans to surrender. Caton does not answer. He waits until the enemy ships have closed to 4700 yards before returning fire, repelling the landing attempt and sinking several ships.

On a reconnaissance flight, Cameron spots a Japanese heavy cruiser that can hit the island while remaining out of range of the defenders&#x27; weapons. He says he can take out that ship if his fighter is stripped down and carries only 15 gallons of fuel and a double load of bombs. Caton approves the mission. After successfully bombing the ship, Cameron is wounded by a Japanese fighter. He manages to land his airplane safely before dying.

Japanese planes bomb the island repeatedly.

Caton asks Captain Lewis to board a U.S. Navy patrol plane that is coming in, since he could provide intelligence to the U.S. Navy Department in Honolulu. Lewis refuses, but Caton orders him to go and file his official report.

Later, Caton is informed that they are running out of the largest-caliber ammunition, so he has smaller guns spread around and repositions his available men. Japanese planes approach in large numbers, causing major damage and inflicting numerous casualties. Only one pilot is left, Captain Patrick. When his plane is damaged, he bails out, but is killed while parachuting down.

The Japanese again signal for surrender. Caton replies, &quot;Come and get us.&quot; Eventually, Caton orders all posts to act independently. Communications fail. Caton orders the last man out of his command post with a written message, as McClosky walks in, asking for a weapon. They make their way to an abandoned machine-gun position. Caton mans the gun. The Japanese land and overrun the American positions. The main characters are all killed in action. The film was made in 1942, at the beginning of American entry into World War II, shortly after the battle itself. It ends with a voiceover declaring: &quot;This is not the end.&quot;

Chuck Connors is sometimes erroneously credited as a soldier in the meal line, but Connors was not in California during production, being at that time a full-time player for the Norfolk Tars, a baseball team in the minor league Piedmont League. Mary Thomas appeared as Caton&#x27;s daughter.

==Production==
The film was based on official Marine records. A copy of the script by W. R. Burnett and Frank Butler was sent to the Marine Corps for approval prior to filming.

Director John Farrow had recently returned to Hollywood after being invalided out of the Canadian Navy. He was signed to make the film by Buddy DeSylva of Paramount, who liked Farrow&#x27;s 1939 film &quot;Five Came Back&quot;. Farrow had visited Wake Island during his pre-Hollywood sailing days.

Filming started 23 March 1942. Most of the Japanese were played by Filipinos.

A special weapons detail of selected Marines from Camp Elliott, near San Diego, manned machine guns in land battle scenes. Marine crews were also used as extras and to operate equipment.

Three main locations were used. Most exteriors were shot in the Salton Sea in the California desert; filming took place here for three weeks at Sandy Beach which resembled Wake Island. The aerial battles were filmed at the Great Salt Lake in Utah. The big guns were fired at a coastal firing range near San Diego.

The film was a fictional account with Brian Donlevy&#x27;s character being based on Major James P. S. Devereux, commander of the 1st Defense Battalion detachment on Wake. MacDonald Carey&#x27;s was based on Major Henry T. Elrod and Captain Frank Cunningham. Walter Abel played the naval commander who in real life was Commander Winfield S. Cunningham.

The film crew had to battle intense sand storms on Sand Island. Following the location shoot, the main unit returned to Paramount Studio for three weeks of filming, while the second unit remained at Salton Sea under Hal Walker to do bombing scenes.

After completing the film, Farrow signed a long-term contract with Paramount.

MacDonald Carey was so inspired by working on the picture that he joined the United States Marine Corps after filming ended.

A radio play drama version featuring many of the same film actors was broadcast October 26, 1942 on the &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot;, hosted by Cecil B. DeMille on the CBS radio network.

==Reception==

The film received positive reviews from critics. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a film for which its makers deserve a sincere salute. Except for the use of fictional names and a very slight contrivance of plot, it might be a literal document of the manner in which the Wake detachment of Marines fought and died in the finest tradition of their tough and indomitable corps.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; agreed and called it &quot;one of the most striking pictures of the year ... Never is there pandering to phoney flag-waving, always just a group of normal human beings who knew of no other course than fighting to the end.&quot;

&quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; called it &quot;Thrilling ... The realism of the Japanese attacks, and the stout defense put up by the Marines, are spine-chilling battle scenes that hold one in constant suspense, even though one is aware of the final outcome.&quot; &quot;Film Daily&quot; called it a &quot;Stirring epic which will thrill the nation.&quot;

&quot;Wake Island&quot; placed fourth on &quot;Film Daily&quot;&#x27;s year-end nationwide poll of 592 critics selecting the best films of 1942.

On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Wake Island&quot; holds a rating of 89% based on 9 contemporary and modern reviews. 

It was one of the biggest box office hits of the year.

== Awards ==
At the 15th Academy Awards on March 4, 1943, &quot;Wake Island&quot; was nominated for Outstanding Motion Picture, Best Director (John Farrow), Best Actor in a Supporting Role (William Bendix), and Original Screenplay (W.R. Burnett and Frank Butler). John Farrow won the New York Film Critics&#x27; Award for Best Director.

<doc id="77652" wikidata="Q200920" url="?curid=77652" title="For Whom the Bell Tolls">
<text>For Whom the Bell Tolls is a novel by Ernest Hemingway published in 1940. It tells the story of Robert Jordan, a young American volunteer attached to a Republican guerrilla unit during the Spanish Civil War. As a dynamiter, he is assigned to blow up a bridge during an attack on the city of Segovia.

It was published just after the end of the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), whose general lines were well known at the time. It assumes the reader knows that the war was between the government of the Second Spanish Republic, which many foreigners went to Spain to help and which was supported by the Communist Soviet Union, and the Nationalist faction, which was supported by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. In 1940, the year the book was published, the United States had not yet entered World War II, which began on September 1, 1939, with Nazi Germany&#x27;s invasion of Poland.

The novel is regarded as one of Hemingway&#x27;s best works, along with &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;, &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot;, and &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;.

==Background==
Ernest Hemingway wrote &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; in 1939 from three locations: Havana, Cuba; Key West, Florida; and Sun Valley, Idaho. In Cuba, he lived in the Hotel Ambos Mundos, where he worked on the manuscript. The novel was finished in July 1940 at the InterContinental New York Barclay Hotel in New York City and published in October. The story is based on Hemingway&#x27;s experiences during the Spanish Civil War as a reporter for the North American Newspaper Alliance and features an American who fights alongside Spanish guerillas for the Republicans. The novel graphically describes the brutality of the war and is told primarily through the thoughts and experiences of the protagonist, Robert Jordan.

The characters in the novel include those who are purely fictional, those based on real people but fictionalized, and those who were actual figures in the war. Set in the Sierra de Guadarrama mountain range between Madrid and Segovia, the action takes place during four days and three nights. &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; became a Book of the Month Club choice, sold half a million copies within months, was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, and became a literary triumph for Hemingway. Published on October 21, 1940, the first edition print run was 75,000 copies priced at $2.75.

The book&#x27;s title is taken from the metaphysical poet John Donne&#x27;s series of meditations and prayers on health, pain, and sickness (written while Donne was convalescing from a nearly fatal illness) published in 1624 as &quot;Devotions upon Emergent Occasions&quot;, specifically . Hemingway quotes part of the meditation (using Donne&#x27;s original spelling) in the book&#x27;s epigraph. Donne refers to the practice of funeral tolling, universal in his time.

No man is an &quot;Island&quot;, intire of it selfe; every man is a piece of the &quot;Continent&quot;, a part of the &quot;maine&quot;; if a &quot;Clod&quot; bee washed away by the &quot;Sea&quot;, &quot;Europe&quot; is the lesse, as well as if a &quot;Promontorie&quot; were, as well as if a &quot;Mannor&quot; of thy &quot;friends&quot; or of &quot;thine&quot; &quot;owne &quot; were; any mans &quot;death&quot; diminishes &quot;me&quot;, because I am involved in &quot;Mankinde&quot;; And therefore never send to know for whom the &quot;bell&quot; tolls; It tolls for &quot;thee&quot;.

Due to the popularity of Hemingway&#x27;s book, this text became known to many people who never read any other of Donne&#x27;s works.

==Plot summary==
Robert Jordan is an American, formerly a professor of Spanish language at the University of Montana. He had lived in prewar Spain, and fights as an irregular soldier for the Republic against Francisco Franco&#x27;s fascist forces. An experienced dynamiter, he is ordered by a Soviet general to travel behind enemy lines and destroy a bridge with the aid of a band of local anti-fascist guerrillas to prevent enemy troops from responding to an upcoming offensive. On his mission, Jordan meets the rebel Anselmo, the &quot;old man&quot;, who brings him to the hidden guerrilla camp in the Sierra de Guadarrama mountains between Madrid and Segovia. Anselmo initially acts as an intermediary between Jordan and the other guerrilla fighters. They include Agustín, Primitivo, Fernando, brothers Andrés and Eladio, and Rafael, often referred to pejoratively as &quot;the gypsy&quot;.

In the camp, Jordan encounters María, a young Spanish woman whose life has been shattered by her parents&#x27; execution and her rape at the hands of the Falangists (part of the fascist coalition) at the outbreak of the war. His strong sense of duty clashes with both the unwillingness of the guerrilla leader Pablo to commit to an operation that would endanger himself and his band and Jordan&#x27;s own new-found lust for life, which arises from his love for María. Pablo&#x27;s wife, the strong-willed Pilar, with the support of the other guerrillas, displaces Pablo as the group leader and pledges the allegiance of the guerrillas to Jordan&#x27;s mission. 

When another band of anti-fascist guerrillas, led by El Sordo, is surrounded and killed during a raid they conducted in support of Jordan&#x27;s mission, Pablo steals the dynamite detonators and exploder, hoping to prevent the demolition and to avoid fascist reprisals. Although he disposes of the detonators and exploder by throwing them down a gorge into the river, Pablo regrets abandoning his comrades and returns to assist in the operation.

The enemy, apprised of the coming offensive, has prepared to ambush it in force and it seems unlikely that the blown bridge will do much to prevent a rout. However, Jordan understands that he must still demolish the bridge unless he receives explicit orders to the contrary. Lacking the detonation equipment stolen by Pablo, Jordan devises an alternative method: exploding the dynamite by using hand grenades with wires attached so that their pins can be pulled from a distance. The improvised plan is considerably more dangerous as the guerrillas must be nearer to the explosion. While Pilar, Pablo, and other guerrillas attack the posts at the two ends of the bridge, Jordan and Anselmo plant and detonate the dynamite, costing Anselmo his life when he is hit by a piece of shrapnel. While escaping, Jordan is maimed when a tank shoots his horse out from under him. Knowing that his wound is so severe that it is highly unlikely that he will survive and that he would slow the others down, he bids farewell to María and ensures her escape to safety with the surviving guerrillas. He refuses Agustín&#x27;s offer to shoot him and lies waiting in agony, hoping to kill an enemy officer and delay the pursuit of his comrades before he dies. The narrative ends with Jordan waiting for the perfect opportunity to launch his ambush, if he does not go unconscious (or die) first.

==Characters==
* Robert Jordan – American university instructor of the Spanish language and a specialist in demolitions and explosives.
* Anselmo – Elderly guide to Robert Jordan.
* Golz – Soviet officer who ordered the bridge&#x27;s demolition.
* Pablo – Leader of a group of anti-fascist guerrillas.
* Rafael – Well-intentioned yet incompetent and lazy guerrilla, and a gypsy.
* María – Robert Jordan&#x27;s young lover.
* Pilar – Pablo&#x27;s wife. An aged but strong woman, she is the de facto leader of the guerrilla band.
* Karkov – Soviet agent and journalist in Madrid, and a friend of Jordan&#x27;s.
* Agustín – Foul-mouthed, middle-aged guerrilla.
* El Sordo – Leader of a fellow band of guerrillas.
* Fernando – Middle-aged guerrilla.
* Andrés and Eladio – Brothers and members of Pablo&#x27;s band.
* Primitivo – Old guerrilla in Pablo&#x27;s band.
* Joaquín – Enthusiastic teenaged communist, a member of Sordo&#x27;s band.

==Imagery==
The novel contains imagery of soil and earth. The imagery appears rather famously at the start of chapter 13. Jordan and María have sex in a meadow in the forest. He feels &quot;the earth move out and away from under them.&quot; Then afterwards he asks María, &quot;Did thee feel the earth move?&quot;, to which she responds affirmatively. Variants of this phrase have become a cultural cliché, often used humorously. The Oxford English Dictionary contains the phrase &#x27;the earth moves&#x27; and describes it as &#x27;used to refer to the experience of having an orgasm&#x27;, &#x27;first attested in &quot;For Whom The Bell Tolls&quot; by Ernest Hemingway&#x27;.

==References to actual events==
The novel takes place in late May 1937, during the second year of the Spanish Civil War. References made to Valladolid, Segovia, El Escorial, and Madrid suggest the novel takes place within the build-up to the Republican attempt to relieve the siege of Madrid.

The earlier battle of Guadalajara and the general chaos and disorder (and, more generally, the doomed cause of Republican Spain) serve as a backdrop to the novel: Robert Jordan notes, for instance, that he follows the Communists because of their superior discipline, an allusion to the split and infighting between anarchist and communist factions on the Republican side.

The famous and pivotal scene described in Chapter 10, in which Pilar describes the execution of various fascist figures in her village, is drawn from events that took place in Ronda in 1936. Although Hemingway later claimed (in a 1954 letter to Bernard Berenson) to have completely fabricated the scene, he in fact drew upon the events at Ronda, embellishing the event by imagining an execution line leading up to the cliff face.

A number of actual figures that played a role in the Spanish Civil War are also referred to in the book, including these:
* Andreu Nin, one of the founders of the Workers&#x27; Party of Marxist Unification (POUM), the party mocked by Karkov in Chapter 18.
* Enrique Líster, communist leader who played important roles during the defense of Madrid.
* Mikhail Koltsov, Soviet journalist who was the Karkov character in the story
* Indalecio Prieto, one of the leaders of the Republicans, is also mentioned in Chapter 18.
* General José Miaja, in charge of the defense of Madrid in October 1936, and General Vicente Rojo, together with Prieto, are mentioned in Chapter 35
* Dolores Ibárruri, better known as La Pasionaria, is extensively described in Chapter 32.
* Robert Hale Merriman, leader of the American Volunteers in the International Brigades, and his wife Marion, were well known to Hemingway and served possibly as a model for Hemingway&#x27;s own hero. 
* André Marty, a leading French Communist and political officer in the International Brigades, makes a brief but significant appearance in Chapter 42. Hemingway depicts Marty as a vicious intriguer whose paranoia interferes with Republican objectives in the war.
* Karol Świerczewski, a Russian general of Polish origin as Golz.
* Francisco Franco, commander of the rebel army who will become the ruling dictator after the war.

==Critical reception and impact==
On November 5, 2019, BBC News listed &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; on its list of the 100 most inspiring novels.

===Censorship===
In 1940, &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; was declared non-mailable by the U.S. Post Office.

In 1973, the book was banned in Turkey because the book included &quot;propaganda unfavorable to the state.&quot; On February 21 of that year, eleven Turkish book publishers and eight booksellers &quot;went on trial before an Istanbul martial law tribunal on charges of publishing, possessing, and selling books in violation of an order of the Istanbul martial law command. They faced possible sentences of between one month&#x27;s and six months’ imprisonment and the confiscation of their books.&quot;

===Language===
Since its publication, the prose style and dialogue in Hemingway&#x27;s novel have been the source of negative critical reaction. For example, Edmund Wilson, in a tepid review, noted the encumbrance of &quot;a strange atmosphere of literary medievalism&quot; in the relationship between Robert Jordan and Maria.

Additionally, much of the dialogue in the novel is an implied direct translation from Spanish, producing an often strained English equivalent. For example, Hemingway uses the construction &quot;&quot;, which is an implied translation of the Spanish construction . This translation extends to the use of linguistic &quot;false friends&quot;, such as &quot;&quot; (from ) instead of &quot;strange&quot; and &quot;&quot; (from ) instead of &quot;trade union&quot;.

===Pulitzer Prize snub===
In 1941, the Pulitzer Prize committee for letters unanimously recommended &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; be awarded the Pulitzer Prize for the Novel for that year. The Pulitzer Board agreed. However, Nicholas Murray Butler, president of Columbia University and &quot;ex officio&quot; head of the Pulitzer board at that time, found the novel offensive and persuaded the board to reverse its determination; no Pulitzer was given for the category of novel that year.

===In Spain===
In 1944, the book was first published in Spanish by an Argentinian publishing house, Editorial Claridad, with many subsequent editions produced either in Argentina or in Mexico. In Spain, it was initially viewed very suspiciously by the Francoist censorship office; in 1942–43 the Spanish diplomatic corps went to great lengths in trying to influence the final edit of the Hollywood film based on the novel, which was not permitted to be shown in Spanish cinemas. Since 1953, when &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; was published in Madrid, most of Hemingway&#x27;s stories and novels had been published in Spain. However, this was not the case with &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;, although the novel was at times discussed in the press. Prohibition of the book&#x27;s publishing was rescinded only in late 1968. By the end of the year &quot;Por quién doblan las campanas&quot; had been published by Editorial Planeta.

==Legacy==
===Adaptations===

* A film adaptation titled &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; was released in 1943.

<doc id="77653" wikidata="Q1305546" url="?curid=77653" title="Heaven Can Wait (1943 film)">
<text>Heaven Can Wait is a 1943 Technicolor American supernatural comedy film produced and directed by Ernst Lubitsch. The screenplay was by Samson Raphaelson based on the play &quot;Birthday&quot; by Ladislaus Bus-Fekete. The music score was by Alfred Newman and the cinematography by Edward Cronjager.

The film tells the story of a man who has to prove he belongs in Hell by telling his life story. It stars Gene Tierney, Don Ameche, and Charles Coburn. The supporting cast includes Marjorie Main, Laird Cregar, Spring Byington, Allyn Joslyn, Eugene Pallette, Signe Hasso, Louis Calhern, Tod Andrews, and Clara Blandick.

The film has no connection to the fantasy-based stage play of the same title that was adapted as the film &quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan&quot; (itself also a Best Picture nominee), nor remakes of &quot;Mr. Jordan&quot; using the play&#x27;s original title, including the 1978 film, &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;.

==Plot==
An aged Henry Van Cleve enters the opulent reception area of &quot;where innumerable people had told him so often to go&quot;, to be personally greeted by &quot;His Excellency&quot;. Henry petitions to be admitted (fully aware of the kind of life he has led), but some doubt exists as to his qualifications. To prove his worthiness (or rather unworthiness), he begins to tell the story of his dissolute life.

Born in Manhattan on October 25, 1872, Henry is the spoiled only child of stuffy, naive, wealthy parents Randolph and Bertha. His paternal grandmother is also doting and naive, although his down-to-earth grandfather Hugo Van Cleve, a self-made millionaire, understands Henry quite well. Henry grows up to be an idle young man with a taste for attractive showgirls. One day, Henry overhears a beautiful woman lying to her mother on a public telephone. Intrigued, he follows her into a Brentano&#x27;s bookstore and pretends to be an employee to get to know her better. Despite learning that she is engaged to marry, he begins making advances, finally confessing he does not work there, whereupon she hastily departs.

Later, his obnoxious cousin Albert introduces the family to his fiancée, Martha, and her feuding parents, the Strables. Henry is shocked to find that his mystery woman and Martha are one and the same. It turns out that Albert was the first suitor of whom both her parents approved. Fearful of spending the rest of her life as a spinster in Kansas City, Martha agreed to marry him. Henry convinces her to elope with him instead. Though everyone except Grandpa Van Cleve is scandalized, eventually they are received back into the family.

Henry and Martha enjoy a happy marriage and become the proud parents of a boy. On the eve of their tenth anniversary, however, Martha finds out about what appears to be Henry&#x27;s continuing dalliances with other women and goes back to her parents. Henry and Grandpa follow her there. Sneaking into the Strable house, Henry corrects the misunderstanding, begs her forgiveness, and talks her into &quot;eloping&quot; a second time, much to Grandpa&#x27;s delight.

Fifteen years later, Henry meets chorus girl Peggy Nash in her dressing room shortly before her performance. What seems to be an attempt at courtship is soon revealed as an attempt by Henry to turn her away from his son, Jack, who has been dating her. When Peggy reveals her knowledge of his true identity, Henry buys her off, instead, for $25,000 (equivalent to about $ in ). Jack later reveals he was glad to have got rid of her so easily.

Martha passes away shortly after their 25th anniversary. Henry resumes an active social life much to the amusement of his son. On October 26, 1942, the day after his 70th birthday, Henry dies under the care of a beautiful nurse, her coming having been portended in a dream. After hearing Henry&#x27;s story, His Excellency denies him entry and suggests he try the &quot;other place&quot;, where Martha and his grandfather are waiting for him, hinting that there may be &quot;a small room vacant in the annex&quot;.

==Reception==
A contemporary review by Bosley Crowther in &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the film as &quot;certainly one you&#x27;ll want to see&quot; and &quot;a comedy of manners, edged with satire, in the slickest Lubitsch style&quot; that &quot;is poking very sly and sentimental fun at Eighteen Nineties naughtiness,&quot; adding that although the &quot;picture has utterly no significance. Indeed, it has very little point, except to afford entertainment [...] it does [that] quite well.&quot; The review also notes that &quot;Don Ameche and Gene Tierney are flat in the roles. Or rather, they lack the flexibility which such mannered comedy demands.&quot; A review of the film in &quot;Variety&quot; reported that it features &quot;generous slices of comedy, skillfully handled by producer-director Ernst Lubitsch [who] has endowed it with light, amusing sophistication and heart-warming nostalgia,&quot; noting that &quot;Charles Coburn as the fond grandfather [...] walks away with the early sequences in a terrific comedy performance.&quot; Writing in Turner Classic Movies, critic David Kalat described the film as &quot;a representative example of its time: It&#x27;s a costume drama that luxuriates in period detail&quot; and &quot;a character study told with inventive narrative techniques and non-chronological structure.&quot;

The film made a profit of $1,286,200.

<doc id="77655" wikidata="Q58514" url="?curid=77655" title="Louis XII">
<text>Louis XII (27 June 14621 January 1515), also known as Louis of Orléans, was King of France from 1498 to 1515 and King of Naples from 1501 to 1504. The son of Charles, Duke of Orléans, and Marie of Cleves, he succeeded his second cousin once removed and brother-in-law, Charles VIII, who died childless in 1498.

Louis was the second cousin of King Louis XI, who compelled him to marry the latter&#x27;s disabled and supposedly sterile daughter Joan. By doing so, Louis XI hoped to extinguish the Orléans cadet branch of the House of Valois. When Louis XII became king in 1498, he had his marriage with Joan annulled by Pope Alexander VI and instead married Anne, Duchess of Brittany, the widow of Charles VIII. This marriage allowed Louis to reinforce the personal Union of Brittany and France.

Louis of Orléans was one of the great feudal lords who opposed the French monarchy in the conflict known as the Mad War. At the royal victory in the Battle of Saint-Aubin-du-Cormier in 1488, Louis was captured, but Charles VIII pardoned him and released him. He subsequently took part in the Italian Wars, initiating a second Italian campaign for the control of the Kingdom of Naples. Louis conquered the Duchy of Milan in 1500 and pushed forward to the Kingdom of Naples, which fell to him in 1501. Proclaimed King of Naples, Louis faced a new coalition gathered by Ferdinand II of Aragon and was forced to cede Naples to Spain in 1504. Louis, who remained Duke of Milan after the second Italian War, was interested in further expansion in the Italian Peninsula and launched a third Italian War (1508–1516), which was marked by the military prowess of the Chevalier de Bayard.

Louis XII did not encroach on the power of local governments or the privileges of the nobility, in opposition with the long tradition of the French kings to attempt to impose absolute monarchy in France. A popular king, Louis was proclaimed &quot;Father of the People&quot; () for his reduction of the tax known as taille, legal reforms, and civil peace within France. Louis XII died in 1515 without a male heir. He was succeeded by his cousin and son-in-law Francis I from the Angoulême cadet branch of the House of Valois.

==Early life==

Louis d&#x27;Orléans was born on 27 June 1462 in the Château de Blois, Touraine (in the modern French department of Loir-et-Cher). The son of Charles, Duke of Orléans, and Marie of Cleves. His father was almost seventy years old when Louis was born. Louis was only three years old when he succeeded as Duke of Orléans upon the death of his father in 1465.

Louis XI, who had become king of France in 1461, became highly distrustful of the close relationship between the Orleanists and the Burgundians and began to oppose the idea of an Orleanist ever coming to the throne of France. However, Louis XI might have been more influenced in this opinion by his opposition to the entire Orleanist faction of the royal family than by the actual facts of this paternity case. Despite any alleged doubts that King Louis XI had, the King, nevertheless, became the godfather of the newborn.

King Louis XI died on 30 August 1483. He was succeeded to the throne of France by his thirteen-year-old son, Charles VIII. Nobody knew the direction which the new king (or more accurately his regent and oldest sister, Anne of France) would take in leading the kingdom. Accordingly, on 24 October 1483, a call went out for a convocation of the Estates General of the French kingdom. In January 1484, deputies of the Estates General began to arrive in Tours, France. The deputies represented three different &quot;estates&quot; in society. The First Estate was the Church; in France this meant the Roman Catholic Church. The Second Estate was composed of the nobility and the royalty of France. The Third Estate was generally composed of commoners and the class of traders and merchants in France. Louis, the current Duke of Orleans and future Louis XII, attended as part of the Second Estate. Each estate brought its chief complaints to the Estates General in hopes to have some impact on the policies that the new King would pursue.

The First Estate (the Church) wanted a return to the &quot;Pragmatic Sanction&quot;. The Pragmatic Sanction had been first instituted by King Charles VII, the former King Charles VIII&#x27;s grandfather. The Pragmatic Sanction excluded the papacy from the process of appointing bishops and abbots in France. Instead, these positions would be filled by appointment made by the cathedrals and monastery chapters themselves. All church prelates within France would be appointed by the King of France without reference to the pope.

The deputies representing the Second Estate (the nobility) at the Estates General of 1484 wanted all foreigners to be prohibited from command positions in the military. The deputies of the Third Estate (the merchants and traders) wanted taxes to be drastically reduced and the revenue needs of the crown to be met by reducing royal pensions and the number of offices. All three of the estates were in agreement on the demand for an end to the sale of government offices. By 7 March 1484, the King announced that he was leaving Tours because of poor health. Five days later, the deputies were told that there was no more money to pay their salaries, and the Estates General meekly concluded its business and went home. The Estates General of 1484 is called, by historians, the most important Estates General until the Estates General of 1789. Important as they were, many of the reforms suggested at the meeting of the Estates General were not immediately adopted. Rather the reforms would only be acted on when Louis XII came to the throne.

Since Charles VIII was only thirteen years of age when he became king, his older sister Anne was to serve as regent until Charles VIII became 20 years old. From 1485 through 1488, there was another war against the royal authority of France conducted by a collections of nobles. This war was the Mad War (1485–1488), Louis&#x27;s war against Anne. Allied with Francis II, Duke of Brittany, Louis confronted the royal army at the Battle of Saint-Aubin-du-Cormier on 28 July 1488 but was defeated and captured. Pardoned three years later, Louis joined his cousin King Charles VIII in campaigns in Italy, leading the vanguards of the army.

All four children of Charles VIII by Anne of Brittany died in infancy. The French interpretation of the Salic Law permitted claims to the French throne only by male agnatic descendants of French kings. This made Louis, the great-grandson of King Charles V, the most senior claimant as heir of Charles VIII. Thus, Louis, Duke of Orleans, succeeded to the throne on 7 April 1498 as Louis XII upon the death of King Charles VIII.

==Reign==
===Governance===

Although he came late (and unexpectedly) to power, Louis acted with vigour, reforming the French legal system, reducing taxes, and improving the government much like his contemporary Henry VII did in the Kingdom of England. To meet his budget after having reduced taxes, Louis XII reduced the pensions for the nobility and for foreign princes. In religious policy, Louis XII reinstituted the Pragmatic Sanction, which established the Roman Catholic Church in France as a &quot;Gallic Church&quot; with most of the power of appointment in the hands of the king or other French officials. As noted above, these reforms had been proposed at the meeting of the Estates General in 1484.

Louis was also skilled in managing his nobility, including the powerful Bourbon faction, greatly contributing to the stability of French government. In the Ordinance of Blois of 1499 and the Ordinance of Lyon issued in June 1510 he extended the powers of royal judges and made efforts to curb corruption in the law. Highly complex French customary law was codified and ratified by the royal proclamation of the Ordinance of Blois of 1499. The Ordinance of Lyon tightened up the tax collection system requiring, for instance, that tax collectors forward all money to the government within eight days after they collected it from the people. Fines and loss of office were prescribed for violations of this ordinance.

===Early wars===
The French Kingdom under Charles VIII invaded Italy in 1494 to protect the Duchy of Milan from the threats of the Republic of Venice. At the time, the Duchy of Milan was one of the most prosperous regions of Europe. Louis, the current Duke of Orleans and future King Louis XII, joined Charles VIII on this campaign. The French Kingdom was responding to an appeal for assistance from Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan. The invasion set off a series of wars that would last from 1494 until 1559 and would become known as the &quot;Italian Wars&quot;.


In 1495, Ludovico Sforza betrayed the French by changing sides in the war and joining the anti-French League of Venice (sometimes called the &quot;Holy League&quot;). This left Louis, the Duke of Orleans, in an awkward and inferior military position at the Battle of Fornovo on 6 July 1495. As a result, Louis had come to hate Ludovico Sforza. Accordingly, even before he became King of France, Louis began to claim the Duchy of Milan as his own inheritance, which should have come to his by right of his paternal grandmother Valentina Visconti.

On this occasion he tried to conquer the Duchy of Milan, weakened by an economic crisis, and on 11 June 1495 he occupied with his troops the city of Novara, which was given to him by treason. He was on the verge of subjugating &quot;il Moro&quot;, who proved unable to cope with the situation, but clashed with the fierce opposition of Sforza&#x27;s wife Beatrice d&#x27;Este, who forced him to a long and exhausting siege from which he finally came out defeated.

After becoming king in 1499, Louis XII pursued his ambition to claim Milan in what is known as the &quot;Great Italian War&quot; (1499–1504) or &quot;King Louis XII&#x27;s War&quot;. However, before initiating any war Louis XII needed to deal with the international threats that he faced. In August 1498, he signed a peace treaty with the Emperor Maximillian I of the Holy Roman Empire.

With Maximillian I neutralized, Louis wanted to turn his attention to King Henry VII of England. However, Henry was then pursuing a marriage between his eldest son, Arthur, Prince of Wales, and Catherine of Aragon, the Infanta of Spain. Thus Louis needed to detach Spain from its close relations with England before he could deal with Henry VII. Furthermore, Spain was then a member of the anti-French League of Venice. Ferdinand of Aragon, king of the newly unified Spain, directed all relations between Spain and the French on behalf of himself and his queen, Isabella I of Castile. Ferdinand was so hostile to France that he had founded the anti-French League of Venice in 1495. In August 1498, Louis XII succeeded in signing a treaty with Spain that ignored all the territorial disputes between France and Spain and merely pledged mutual friendship and non-aggression.

This allowed enough freedom for Louis XII to start negotiating with Scotland for an alliance. Actually, Louis was merely seeking to revive the Auld Alliance between France and Scotland that had been in existence since King Philip IV of France first recognised Robert the Bruce (reigned 1306–1329) as King of Scotland in 1309. In early 1499, the old alliance between Scotland and France was renewed and the attentions of England were drawn northwards towards Scotland rather than southwards towards continental Europe.

With the major powers preoccupied or pledged to peace with France, Louis XII could attend to two other neighbours on his border: the Swiss Confederation and the Duchy of Savoy. In March 1499, Louis signed an agreement with the Swiss Confederation that promised 20,000 francs as an annual subsidy for simply allowing the French to recruit an unspecified number of troops in the Confederation. In exchange, Louis promised to protect the Confederation from any aggression from Maximillian and the Holy Roman Empire. Louis opened negotiations with the Duchy of Savoy and by May 1499 had hammered out an agreement that allowed French troops to cross Savoy to reach the Duchy of Milan. The agreement with Savoy also allowed France to purchase supplies and to recruit troops in Savoy. Finally, Louis was ready to march into Italy.

The French army had been a potent force in 1494 when Charles VIII had first invaded Italy. However, during the remainder of Charles VIII&#x27;s reign, the army had been allowed to deteriorate through neglect. Ever since becoming king, Louis XII had been rebuilding the French army. Now he could put it to use.

On 10 August 1499, after marching across Savoy and through the town of Asti, the French army crossed the border into the Duchy of Milan. Contrary to the wishes of the Second Estate (the nobles and royalty of France), expressed at the Estates General in 1484, this French army was being led by a foreigner, Gian Giacomo Trivulzio. Marshal Trivulzio had been in the service of the French throne since the reign of Louis XI, but he had been born and raised in Milan. The French army that Marshal Trivulzio now commanded consisted of 27,000 men of which 10,000 were mounted. The French army was also supplied with 5,000 Swiss mercenaries. In the campaign of 1499, the French army surrounded the fortified town of Rocca di Arazzo in the western part of the Duchy of Milan. After five hours of bombardment by the French artillery batteries, the walls of Rocca di Arazzo were breached and the town was taken by the French. Louis XII had ordered his army to massacre the garrison and many civilians as a message to the other towns in the Duchy against resistance to the French army. The legal rationale for the massacre at Rocca di Arazzo was that defenders of the town were traitors because they had risen up in arms against their rightful lord, Louis XII. The French repeated the episode at Annone, the next fortified town on the road to the city of Milan. This time the massacre had the desired effect, as three more fortified towns surrendered without a fight. Marshal Trivulzio then brought the French Army up to the gates of the town of Alessandro, and his batteries began battering the walls of the town on 25 August 1499. At first, a vigorous defense was mounted by the garrison, but on 29 August 1499, the city gave up and the garrison and the governor of the city slipped out of town before dawn.

Marshal Trivulzio now became aware that the Venetian army, allies of the Duchy of Milan, were crossing into the Duchy from the east in an attempt to aid the Milanese army before it was too late. Accordingly, Marshal Trivulzio marched his army to Pavia, the last fortified town in the Duchy of Milan. With French troops already near Pavia, a short distance west of the city of Milan, Lodovico Sforza determined that it was useless to continue resisting the French. Accordingly, on the night of 2 September 1499, Sforza and a band of cavalry fled Milan, heading northward to the Holy Roman Empire. Louis XII, staying in Lyon, heard about the surrender of Milan on 17 September 1499. He immediately left Lyon and on 6 October 1499, Louis XII made his triumphant entry into Milan. Marshal Trevulzio presented the key to the city to Louis, who in turn appointed Marshal Trivulzio as the temporary French governor of Milan. Later, Louis appointed Georges d&#x27; Amboise as the permanent governor of Milan. In an attempt to win popularity with the public in Milan, Louis lowered the old Sforza taxes by as much as one-third.

Meanwhile, Ludovico Sforza had been gathering an army, mainly among the Swiss, to take Milan back. In mid-January 1500, his army crossed the border into the Duchy of Milan and marched toward the city of Milan. Upon hearing the news of Sforza&#x27;s return, some of his partisans in the city rose up. On 1 February 1500, Marshal Trivulzio decided that he could not hold the city, and the French retreated to the fortresses west of the city. Sforza was welcomed back into the city by a joyous crowd of his supporters on 5 February 1500. Louis XII raised another army under Louis de La Trémoille and sent him to recapture Milan. By the time Trémoille reached the forts west of Milan where Marshal Trivulzio and his force were holding out, the French army had swollen to 30,000 men by recruitment along the way. Many of these new recruits in the French army were Swiss mercenaries. The government of the Swiss Confederation heard about the coming battle and forbade any Swiss soldier from fighting against a fellow Swiss, which effectively subtracted all the Swiss from both sides for this particular battle. These troops then started to march back home to Switzerland. This had a much more damaging effect on Sforza&#x27;s army, because his army was composed of a larger proportion of Swiss than the French army under La Trémoille.

Faced with the return of the French and his own greatly reduced force, Sforza decided to slip out of Milan as he had done previously. This time, however, Sforza was captured and spent the rest of his life in a French prison. Despite Milan&#x27;s openly warm welcome of Sforza (which Louis XII regarded as &quot;treasonous&quot;), Louis XII was very generous to the city in victory. While Sforza had been in charge of Milan, the export of grain had been forbidden. Now the French reopened the trade in grain, setting off a decade of prosperity in Milan. Milan was to remain a French stronghold in Italy for twelve years.

Using Milan as his firmly established base, Louis XII began to turn his attention to other parts of Italy. The city of Genoa agreed to the appointment of Philip of Cleves, a cousin of Louis XII, as its new governor. Additionally, the French king now began to espouse his claim to the Kingdom of Naples, though the legal rationale for this claim was weaker than for his claim to Milan, stemming only from his position as the successor to Charles VIII. Nonetheless, Louis XII pursued the claim with vigor.

The presence of several French garrisons in southern Italy, the remnants of Charles VIII&#x27;s first invasion of Italy, provided Louis XII with a toehold in southern Italy from which he hoped to enforce his claim to the Kingdom of Naples. However, Louis first had to deal with a recurring problem in northern Italy. In 1406, the city of Pisa was conquered by Florence but had been in constant revolt almost ever since. In 1494, the Pisans successfully overthrew the Florentine governors of the city. The Florentines requested aid from the French to recapture Pisa, as the city of Florence had long been an ally of France in Italian affairs. However, Louis and his advisers were miffed at Florence because in the recent fight against Sforza, Florence had chosen to abandon France and remain strictly neutral. The French knew that they would need Florence in the coming campaign in the Kingdom of Naples – French troops would need to cross Florentine territory on their way to Naples and they would need Florentine agreement to do so. Accordingly, a French army including 600 knights and 6,000 Swiss infantrymen under the command of Sire de Beaumont was sent to Pisa. On 29 June 1500, a combined French and Florentine force laid siege to Pisa and set up batteries around the town. Within a day of opening fire, the French batteries had knocked down 100 feet of the old medieval walls surrounding the city. Even with the breach in their walls, the Pisans put up such a determined resistance that Beaumont despaired of ever taking Pisa. On 11 July 1500, the French broke camp and retreated north. The diversion to Pisa and the failure there emboldened opponents of the French in Italy. Pursuing the claim to the Kingdom of Naples had become politically impossible until some of the opponents were neutralized. One opponent in particular was Spain. It was at this point, in 1500, that Louis XII pursued the claim of his immediate predecessor to the Kingdom of Naples with Ferdinand II, the King of Aragon and with Queen Isabel of Castile, ruler of Spain.

On 11 November 1500, Ferdinand II and Louis XII signed the Treaty of Granada, which brought Spain into Italian politics in a big way for the first time. Louis XII was severely criticized by contemporary historians including Niccolò Machiavelli; Machiavelli&#x27;s criticism of Louis XII is contained in his work &quot;The Prince&quot;.

===As portrayed in Machiavelli&#x27;s &quot;The Prince&quot;===

Louis&#x27;s failure to hold on to Naples prompted a commentary by Niccolò Machiavelli in his book, &quot;The Prince&quot;:
===Military campaigns against the Kingdom of Naples (1501–1508)===
To assert his claim to his half of the Kingdom of Naples, Louis XII sent an army under the command of Bernard Stuart of Aubigny composed of 1,000 lances, 10,000 infantrymen including 5,000 Swiss troops to Naples in early June 1501. In May 1501, Louis had obtained free passage for his troops to march through Bologne on the way to Naples. As the army approached Rome, Spanish and French ambassadors notified Pope Alexander VI of the thus far secret Treaty of Grenada, signed 11 November 1500, which divided the Kingdom of Naples between France and Spain. The Pope was pleased and enthusiastically issued a bull naming the two kings – Louis XII of France and Ferdinand II of Spain – as the Pope&#x27;s vassals in Naples. Indeed, the public announcement of the treaty in the Vatican was the first news that King Frederick of Naples had received about his fate and his betrayal by his own cousin, Ferdinand.

Being a stern disciplinarian, Lord Stuart held the troops of his army to strict decorum during most of the march to Naples. However, discipline fell apart when the army passed through Capua. The French army plundered and raped Capua mercilessly. However, when news of the rape of Capua spread throughout southern Italy, resistance to the French vanished. Frederick fled and the French Army entered Naples unopposed. Louis XII claimed the throne of Naples and pursuant to the sharing agreement with Ferdinand II shared half the income of Naples with Spain. However, as Machiavelli had predicted, the agreement could not last and in early 1502 relations between France and Spain had gone sour. Negotiations were started between France and Spain over their disagreements about Naples. However, in April 1502, without waiting for the conclusion of these negotiations, Louis sent an army under the command of Louis d&#x27; Armagnac, Duke of Nemours against the Spanish in Apulia.

===War of the League of Cambrai===
Louis&#x27;s greatest success came in the War of the League of Cambrai (1508–1516), his final war, fought against the Venetians, who had again become his enemy. The French army won the Battle of Agnadello on 14 May 1509. However, things became much more difficult in 1510, when the army of Pope Julius II intervened. Julius II founded the Holy League of the League of Cambrai specifically to thwart the ambitions of France. The French were eventually driven from Milan in 1513 by the Swiss.

=== Propaganda ===
Under Louis XII, there was an unprecedented explosion of propaganda and publicity for the French crown. Louis XII had numerous large ceremonies for the various marriages, funerals, and other events that occurred under his reign. These occasions provided Louis with opportunities to project royal power and elevate Louis, which was largely done through iconography. Furthermore, while these royal images flooded the kingdom, popular writers – encouraged by Louis&#x27;s lack of censorship – disseminated praise of their king.

Louis adopted the porcupine as his personal badge and as a royal beast. As a result, the popularity of the now royal creature exploded, resulting in the placement of porcupines in illuminated manuscripts, on edifices, and on cannons. As it was common belief at the time that the porcupine could shoot its quills, the porcupine symbolized the offensive and defensive capabilities of the king. During his years of conquest, Louis portrayed his kingdom to the public as a porcupine – a supposedly invincible creature feared by all. However, by the second half of his reign, Louis began to relegate the aggressive porcupine into a simple heraldic symbol for identification. Seeking to paint himself as a pious and chivalrous king to the public, Louis adopted titles such as &quot;Father of the People&quot; and compared himself to figures like St. Louis to highlight his commitment to justice and reform rather than simply military dominance.

Louis&#x27;s initial of L was often decorated with an open royal crown and laced with fleurs-de-lys. In addition, Louis&#x27;s personal colors were red and yellow (or gold). Thus, guard regiment uniforms, manuscript color schemes, flags, often adorned Louis&#x27;s royal colors and his initial.

Moreover, Louis popularized the state portrait as a propaganda tool. He employed numerous artists to capture him and produce individualized, miniature portraits that can be found in manuscripts today. Furthermore, Louis&#x27;s propaganda arsenal was greatly expanded with the addition of portrait coins – first minted in France in 1514.
As the Duke of Milan, Louis XII, he is portrayed in the painting of Alvise De Donati, Maria Maddalena, Marta, Lazarro and Maximino adored by the Prince and Princess of Provence, Museu Nacional d&#x27;Art de Catalunya Barcelona, originally in the church of San Bartolomeo in Caspano. The King and Queen of France, identified as princes of Provence, are kneeling, the King has in his hands the crown that appears on the coins minted by the Mint of Milan. This is the only known full-length portrait of a king of France by a painter of the Italian Renaissance.

===Legacy===
Under Louis&#x27;s reign, the province of Brittany finally became a de facto permanent province of France – although this was not legally completed until 1547. At the end of his reign, the budget deficit of the crown was no greater than it had been when he succeeded Charles VIII in 1498, despite several expensive military campaigns in Italy. His fiscal reforms of 1504 and 1508 tightened and improved procedures for the collection of taxes.

In spite of his military and diplomatic failures, Louis proved to be a popular king. Historians often attribute Louis&#x27;s popularity to his tax reduction policies. While Francis I eventually raised taxes, Louis&#x27;s redaction of law codes and the creation of new parlements were longer-lasting. He duly earned the title of &quot;Father of the People&quot; (&quot;Le Père du Peuple&quot;) conferred upon him by the Estates in 1506. This was the first and only time that a French king was bestowed the specific honorific of &quot;Father of the People&quot;.

==Family==

===Marriages===

In 1476 he was forced by King Louis XI (his second cousin) to marry his daughter Joan of France. Charles VIII (son of Louis XI) succeeded to the throne of France in 1483, but died childless in 1498, when the throne passed to Louis XII. Charles had been married to Anne, Duchess of Brittany, in order to unite the quasi-sovereign Duchy of Brittany with the Kingdom of France. To sustain this union, Louis XII had his marriage to Joan annulled (December 1498) after he became king so that he could marry Charles VIII&#x27;s widow, Anne of Brittany.

The annulment, described as &quot;one of the seamiest lawsuits of the age&quot;, was not simple. Louis did not, as one might have expected, argue the marriage to be void due to consanguinity (the general allowance for the dissolution of a marriage at that time). Though he could produce witnesses to claim that the two were closely related due to various linking marriages, there was no documentary proof, merely the opinions of courtiers. Likewise, Louis could not argue that he had been below the legal age of consent (fourteen) to marry: no one was certain when he had been born, with Louis claiming to have been twelve at the time, and others ranging in their estimates between eleven and thirteen. As there was no real proof, he had perforce to bring forward other arguments.

Accordingly, Louis (much to the dismay of his wife) claimed that Joan was physically malformed (providing a rich variety of detail precisely how) and that he had therefore been unable to consummate the marriage. Joan, unsurprisingly, fought this uncertain charge fiercely, producing witnesses to Louis&#x27;s boast of having &quot;mounted my wife three or four times during the night&quot;. Louis also claimed that his sexual performance had been inhibited by witchcraft. Joan responded by asking how he was able to know what it was like to try to make love to her. Had the Papacy been a neutral party, Joan would likely have won, for Louis&#x27;s case was exceedingly weak. Pope Alexander VI, however, had political reasons to grant the annulment, and ruled against Joan accordingly. He granted the annulment on the grounds that Louis did not freely marry, but was forced to marry by Joan&#x27;s father Louis XI. Outraged, Joan reluctantly submitted, saying that she would pray for her former husband. She became a nun; she was canonized in 1950.

Louis married the reluctant queen dowager, Anne, in 1499. Still only 22, Anne, who had borne as many as seven stillborn or short-lived children during her previous marriage to King Charles, now bore a further four stillborn sons to the new king, but also two surviving daughters. The elder daughter, Claude (1499–1524), was betrothed by her mother&#x27;s arrangement to the future Emperor Charles V in 1501. But after Anne failed to produce a living son, Louis dissolved the betrothal and betrothed Claude to his heir presumptive, Francis of Angoulême, thereby insuring that Brittany would remain united with France. Anne opposed this marriage, which took place only after her death in 1514. Claude succeeded her mother in Brittany and became queen consort to Francis. The younger daughter, Renée (1510–1575), married Duke Ercole II of Ferrara.

After Anne&#x27;s death, Louis married Mary Tudor, the sister of Henry VIII of England, in Abbeville, France, on 9 October 1514. This represented a final attempt to produce an heir to his throne, for despite two previous marriages the king had no living sons. Louis died on 1 January 1515, less than three months after he married Mary, reputedly worn out by his exertions in the bedchamber, but more likely from the effects of gout. Their union produced no children, and the throne passed to Francis I of France, who was Louis&#x27;s first cousin once removed, and also his son-in-law.

===Issue===
Louis XII had an illegitimate son, Michel Bucy, Archbishop of Bourges, from 1505, who died in 1511 and was buried in Bourges.

==Death==
On 24 December 1514, Louis was reportedly suffering from a severe case of gout. In the early hours of 1 January 1515, he received the final sacraments and died later that evening. On 11 January Louis&#x27;s body was taken to the Notre-Dame for a funeral mass. The next day, during the funeral procession, the cart carrying the coffin broke down and there was a dispute over which party would receive the gold cloth that covered the coffin. Louis was interred in Saint Denis Basilica. He is commemorated by the Tomb of Louis XII and Anne of Brittany.

==Succession==
The succession to the throne of France followed Salic Law, which did not allow women to inherit the throne. As a result, Louis XII was succeeded by Francis I. Born to Louise of Savoy, on 12 September 1494, Francis I was the son of Charles, Count of Angoulême. Francis would also marry Louis XII&#x27;s eldest daughter Claude of France.

The succession to the ducal crown of Brittany followed semi-Salic tradition, allowing women to inherit the crown in their own right (&quot;suo jure&quot;). Anne of Brittany predeceased Louis XII. Thus, Anne&#x27;s eldest daughter, Claude of France, inherited the Duchy of Brittany directly in her own right (&quot;suo jure&quot;) before Louis&#x27;s death. When Claude married Francis I, Francis also became the administrator of Brittany in right of his wife. This assured that Brittany would remain part of the Kingdom of France and the unity of the Kingdom would be upheld.

==Honours==
* – Grand Master of the Order of Saint Michael
* – Duchy of Orléans : Last Grand Master and Knight of the Order of the Porcupine

==Media==
* As Duke of Orleans, he is a recurring character in Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s 1823 novel &quot;Quentin Durward&quot;, where he is portrayed as attempting to break his marriage contract to Joan.
* Louis is portrayed by English actor Joseph Beattie in the Canal+ series &quot;Borgia&quot;. He continues the claim on Naples by Charles VIII, and is also crowned Duke of Milan by Cesare Borgia. Despite his initial friendship with Cesare, their relations are strained by Cesare&#x27;s conflicts with French interests, as well as Cesare&#x27;s heavy-handed methods. After della Rovere becomes Pope Julius II and Cesare&#x27;s downfall begins, Louis offers him exile in France, but Cesare&#x27;s ambition refuses to consider defeat.
* The first season of &quot;The Tudors&quot; contains a plotline based loosely on Louis&#x27; final marriage. Mary is renamed Margaret, to avoid confusion with her niece of the same name, and concessions were made to the altered political landscape of the fictionalized series. The first season starts with Francis I already King of France, but in order to include Mary&#x27;s short royal marriage and scandalous secret remarriage, the writers added a King of Portugal as her bridegroom, who bears no resemblance to the King of Portugal at that time. The marriage is still quite short, as &#x27;Margaret&#x27; smothers her husband with a pillow.
