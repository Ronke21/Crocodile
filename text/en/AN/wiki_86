<text>Delftware or Delft pottery, also known as Delft Blue () or as delf,
is a general term now used for Dutch tin-glazed earthenware, a form of faience. Most of it is blue and white pottery, and the city of Delft in the Netherlands was the major centre of production, but the term covers wares with other colours, and made elsewhere. It is also used for similar pottery, English delftware.

Delftware is one of the types of tin-glazed pottery or faience in which a white glaze is applied, usually decorated with metal oxides, in particular the cobalt oxide that gives the usual blue, and can withstand high firing temperatures, allowing it to be applied under the glaze. Delftware forms part of the worldwide family of blue and white pottery, using variations of the plant-based decoration first developed in 14th-century Chinese porcelain, and in great demand in Europe.

Delftware includes pottery objects of all descriptions, such as plates, vases, figurines and other ornamental forms and tiles. The style originated around 1600, and the most highly regarded period of production is about 1640–1740, but Delftware continues to be produced. In the 17th and 18th centuries the manufacture of Delftware was a major industry, with product exported all over Europe.

== History ==
The earliest tin-glazed pottery in the Netherlands was made in Antwerp where the Italian potter Guido da Savino settled in 1500, and in the 16th century Italian maiolica was the main influence on decorative styles. The manufacture of painted pottery spread from Antwerp to the northern Netherlands, in particular because of the sack of Antwerp by the Spanish troops in 1576 (the &quot;Spanish Fury&quot;). Production developed in Middelburg and Haarlem in the 1570s and in Amsterdam in the 1580s. Much of the finer work was produced in Delft, but simple everyday tin-glazed pottery was made in places such as Gouda, Rotterdam, Haarlem, Amsterdam and Dordrecht.
The main period of tin-glaze pottery in the Netherlands was 1640–1740. From about 1640 Delft potters began using personal monograms and distinctive factory marks. The Guild of St Luke, to which painters in all media had to belong, admitted ten master potters in the thirty years between 1610 and 1640, and twenty in the nine years 1651 to 1660. In 1654 a gunpowder explosion in Delft destroyed many breweries and as the brewing industry was in decline, they became available to pottery makers looking for larger premises; some retained the old brewery names, e.g. &quot;The Double Tankard&quot;, &quot;The Young Moors&#x27; Head&quot;, and &quot;The Three Bells&quot;.

The use of marl, a type of clay rich in calcium compounds, allowed the Dutch potters to refine their technique and to make finer items. The usual clay body of Delftware was a blend of three clays, one local, one from Tournai and one from the Rhineland.

From about 1615, the potters began to coat their pots completely in white tin glaze instead of covering only the painting surface and coating the rest with clear ceramic glaze. They then began to cover the tin-glaze with clear glaze, which gave depth to the fired surface and smoothness to cobalt blues, ultimately creating a good resemblance to porcelain.

During the Dutch Golden Age, the Dutch East India Company had a lively trade with the East and imported millions of pieces of Chinese porcelain in the early 17th century. The Chinese workmanship and attention to detail impressed many. Only the richest could afford the early imports. Dutch potters did not immediately imitate Chinese porcelain; they began to do so after the death of the Wanli Emperor in 1620, when the supply to Europe was interrupted. &quot;Potters now saw an opportunity to produce a cheap alternative for Chinese porcelain. After much experimenting they managed to make a thin type of earthenware which was covered with a white tin glaze. Although made of low-fired earthenware, it resembled porcelain amazingly well.&quot;

Delftware inspired by Chinese originals persisted from about 1630 to the mid-18th century alongside European patterns. Around 1700 several factories were using enamel colours and gilding over the tin-glaze, requiring a third kiln firing at a lower temperature. Later, after Japanese Imari ware had become popular in the late 1600s and early 1700s (when it too tried to fill the gap of the Chinese shortage), Delft began making their own &#x27;Imari ware&#x27; copying the classic &#x27;flower vase on a terrace surrounded by three panels with cranes and pine design&#x27;. Oriental styles in Delftware remained popular into the early 1700s but then declined when Chinese porcelain became available again.

Delftware ranged from simple household items – plain white earthenware with little or no decoration – to fancy artwork. Most of the Delft factories made sets of jars, the &quot;kast-stel&quot; set. Pictorial plates were made in abundance, illustrated with religious motifs, native Dutch scenes with windmills and fishing boats, hunting scenes, landscapes and seascapes. Sets of plates were made with the words and music of songs; dessert was served on them and when the plates were clear the company started singing. The Delft potters also made tiles in vast numbers (estimated at eight hundred million) over a period of two hundred years; many Dutch houses still have tiles that were fixed in the 17th and 18th centuries. Delftware became popular and was widely exported in Europe and even reached China and Japan. Chinese and Japanese potters made porcelain versions of Delftware for export to Europe.

Some regard Delftware from about 1750 onwards as artistically inferior. Caiger-Smith says that most of the later wares &quot;were painted with clever, ephemeral decoration. Little trace of feeling or originality remained to be lamented when, at the end of the eighteenth century, the Delftware potteries began to go out of business.&quot; By this time Delftware potters had lost their market to British porcelain and the new white earthenware. One or two remain: the Tichelaar factory in Makkum, Friesland, founded in 1594 and De Koninklijke Porceleyne Fles (&quot;The Royal Porcelain Bottle&quot;) founded in 1653.

Today, Delfts Blauw (Delft Blue) is the brand name hand painted on the bottom of ceramic pieces identifying them as authentic and collectible. Although most Delft Blue borrows from the tin-glaze tradition, it is nearly all decorated in underglaze blue on a white clay body and very little uses tin glaze, a more expensive product. The Koninklijke Tichelaar Makkum factory in Makkum, Friesland, continues the production of tin-glazed earthenware.

Delft Blue pottery formed the basis of one of British Airways&#x27; ethnic tailfins. The design, Delftblue Daybreak, was applied to 17 aircraft.

<text>Sir Raymond Douglas Davies ( ; born 21 June 1944) is an English musician. He was the lead vocalist, rhythm guitarist and primary songwriter for the rock band the Kinks, which he led with his younger brother Dave on lead guitar and backing vocals. He has also acted in, directed and produced shows for theatre and television. Known for focusing his lyrics on rock bands, English culture, nostalgia and social satire, he is often referred to as the &quot;Godfather of Britpop&quot;, though he disputes this title. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Kinks in 1990. After the dissolution of the Kinks in 1996, he embarked on a solo career.

==Early years==

Raymond Douglas Davies was born at 6 Denmark Terrace in the Fortis Green area of London on 21 June 1944. He is the seventh of eight children born to working-class parents, including six elder sisters and younger brother Dave Davies. His father, Frederick George Davies, was a slaughterhouse worker. Frederick liked to hang out in pubs and was considered a ladies&#x27; man. He was born in Islington and his registered birth name was Frederick George Kelly.

Frederick&#x27;s father, Henry Kelly, was a greengrocer who married Amy Elizabeth Smith at St Luke&#x27;s Church in Kentish Town in 1887, and they had two children, Charles Henry and Frederick George. However, the marriage failed and Amy moved in with Harry Davies, bringing her two small children and her mother. Harry Davies, born in Minsterley in 1878, was an ostler who had moved with his family from Shropshire to Islington. Frederick George had changed his surname to Davies by the time he married Annie Florence Willmore (1905–1987) in Islington in 1924. Annie came from a &quot;sprawling family&quot;. She had a sharp tongue and could be crude and forceful.

When Davies was still a small child, one of his older sisters became a star of the dance halls, and soon had a child out of wedlock by an African man, an unauthorized immigrant who subsequently disappeared from her life. The child, a daughter, was ultimately raised by Ray&#x27;s mother. Ray attended William Grimshaw Secondary Modern School in Muswell Hill along with Rod Stewart (now called Fortismere School). His first Spanish guitar was a birthday gift from his eldest sister Rene, who died at the age of 31 from a heart attack on the day before Ray&#x27;s 13th birthday, while she was out dancing at the Lyceum Ballroom in the Strand, London in June 1957.

==1960s–1980s==
===The Kinks&#x27; early years===

Davies was an art student at Hornsey College of Art in London in 1962–63. In late 1962 he became increasingly interested in music. At a Hornsey College Christmas dance, he sought advice from Alexis Korner who was playing at the dance with Blues Incorporated, and Korner introduced him to Giorgio Gomelsky, a promoter and future manager of the Yardbirds. Gomelsky arranged for Davies to play at his Piccadilly Club with the Dave Hunt Rhythm &amp; Blues Band, and on New Year&#x27;s Eve, the Ray Davies Quartet opened for Cyril Stapleton at the Lyceum Ballroom. A few days later he became the permanent guitarist for the Dave Hunt Band, an engagement that would only last about six weeks. The band were the house band at Gomelsky&#x27;s new venture, the Crawdaddy Club in Richmond-upon-Thames. When the Dave Hunt band were snowed in during the coldest winter since 1740, Gomelsky offered a gig to a new band called the Rolling Stones, who had previously supported Hunt at the Piccadilly and would take over the residency. Davies then joined the Hamilton King Band until June 1963. The Kinks (then known as the Ramrods) spent the summer supporting Rick Wayne on a tour of US airbases.

After the Kinks obtained a recording contract in early 1964, Davies emerged as the chief songwriter and &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the band, especially after the band&#x27;s breakthrough success with his early composition &quot;You Really Got Me&quot;, which was released as the band&#x27;s third single in August of that year. Davies led the Kinks through a period of musical experimentation between 1966 and 1975, with notable artistic achievements and commercial success.

The Kinks&#x27; early recordings of 1964 ranged from covers of R&amp;B standards like &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot; and &quot;Got Love If You Want It&quot; to the chiming, melodic beat music of Ray Davies&#x27;s earliest original compositions for the band, &quot;You Still Want Me&quot; and &quot;Something Better Beginning&quot;, to the more influential proto-metal, protopunk, power chord-based hard rock of the band&#x27;s first two hit singles, &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; and &quot;All Day and All of the Night&quot;.

However, by 1965, this raucous, hard-driving early style had gradually given way to the softer and more introspective sound of &quot;Tired of Waiting for You&quot;, &quot;Nothin&#x27; in the World Can Stop Me Worryin&#x27; &#x27;Bout That Girl&quot;, &quot;Set Me Free&quot;, &quot;I Go to Sleep&quot; and &quot;Ring the Bells&quot;. With the eerie, droning &quot;See My Friends&quot;—inspired by the untimely death of the Davies brothers&#x27; older sister Rene in June 1957—the band began to show signs of expanding their musical palette even further. A rare foray into early psychedelic rock, &quot;See My Friends&quot; is credited by Jonathan Bellman as the first Western pop song to integrate Indian raga sounds—released six months before the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)&quot;.

===Mid-period (1965–1975)===

Beginning with &quot;A Well Respected Man&quot; and &quot;Where Have All the Good Times Gone&quot; (both recorded in the summer of 1965), Davies&#x27;s lyrics assumed a new sociological character. He began to explore the aspirations and frustrations of common working-class people, with particular emphasis on the psychological effects of the British class system. &quot;Face to Face&quot; (1966), the first Kinks album composed solely of original material, was a creative breakthrough. As the band began to experiment with theatrical sound effects and baroque musical arrangements (Nicky Hopkins played harpsichord on several tracks), Davies&#x27;s songwriting fully acquired its distinctive elements of narrative, observation and wry social commentary. His topical songs took aim at the complacency and indolence of wealthy playboys and the upper class (&quot;A House in the Country&quot;, &quot;Sunny Afternoon&quot;), the heedless ostentation of a self-indulgent spendthrift &quot;nouveau riche&quot; (&quot;Most Exclusive Residence For Sale&quot;), and even the mercenary nature of the music business itself (&quot;Session Man&quot;).

By late 1966, Davies was addressing the bleakness of life at the lower end of the social spectrum: released together as the complementary A-B sides of a single, &quot;Dead End Street&quot; and &quot;Big Black Smoke&quot; were powerful neo-Dickensian sketches of urban poverty. Other songs like &quot;Situation Vacant&quot; (1967) and &quot;Shangri-La&quot; (1969) hinted at the helpless sense of insecurity and emptiness underlying the materialistic values adopted by the English working class. In a similar vein, &quot;Dedicated Follower of Fashion&quot; (1966) wittily satirized the consumerism and celebrity worship of Carnaby Street and &#x27;Swinging London&#x27;, while &quot;David Watts&quot; (1967) humorously expressed the wounded feelings of a plain schoolboy who envies the grace and privileges enjoyed by a charismatic upper class student.

The Kinks have been called &quot;the most adamantly British of the Brit Invasion bands&quot; on account of Ray Davies&#x27;s abiding fascination with England&#x27;s imperial past and his tender, bittersweet evocations of &quot;a vanishing, romanticized world of village greens, pubs and public schools&quot;. During the band&#x27;s mid-period, he wrote many cheerfully eccentric—and often ironic—celebrations of traditional English culture and living: &quot;Village Green&quot; (1966), &quot;Afternoon Tea&quot; and &quot;Autumn Almanac&quot; (both 1967), &quot;The Last of the Steam-Powered Trains&quot; (1968), &quot;Victoria&quot; (1969), &quot;Have a Cuppa Tea&quot; (1971) and &quot;Cricket&quot; (1973). In other songs, Davies revived the style of British music hall and trad jazz: &quot;Dedicated Follower of Fashion&quot;, &quot;Sunny Afternoon&quot;, &quot;Dandy&quot; and &quot;Little Miss Queen of Darkness&quot; (all 1966); &quot;Mister Pleasant&quot; and &quot;End of the Season&quot; (both 1967); &quot;Sitting By the Riverside&quot; and &quot;All of My Friends Were There&quot; (both 1968); &quot;She&#x27;s Bought a Hat Like Princess Marina&quot; (1969); &quot;Acute Schizophrenia Paranoia Blues&quot; and &quot;Alcohol&quot; (both 1971); &quot;Look a Little on the Sunny Side&quot; (1972); and &quot;Holiday Romance&quot; (1975). Occasionally, he varied the group&#x27;s sound with more disparate musical influences, such as raga (&quot;Fancy&quot;, 1966), bossa nova (&quot;No Return&quot;, 1967) and calypso (&quot;I&#x27;m on an Island&quot;, 1965; &quot;Monica&quot;, 1968; &quot;Apeman&quot;, 1970; &quot;Supersonic Rocket Ship&quot;, 1972).

Davies is often at his most affecting when he sings of giving up worldly ambition for the simple rewards of love and domesticity (&quot;This is Where I Belong&quot;, 1966; &quot;Two Sisters&quot;, 1967; &quot;The Way Love Used to Be&quot;, 1971; &quot;Sweet Lady Genevieve&quot;, 1973; &quot;You Make It All Worthwhile&quot;, 1974), or when he extols the consolations of friendship and memory (&quot;Waterloo Sunset&quot;, 1967; &quot;Days&quot;, 1968; &quot;Do You Remember Walter?&quot;, 1968; &quot;Picture Book&quot;, 1968; &quot;Young and Innocent Days&quot;, 1969; &quot;Moments&quot;, 1971; &quot;Schooldays&quot;, 1975). Yet another perennial Ray Davies theme is the championing of individualistic personalities and lifestyles (&quot;I&#x27;m Not Like Everybody Else&quot;, 1966; &quot;Johnny Thunder&quot;, 1968; &quot;Monica&quot;, 1968; &quot;Lola&quot;, 1970; &quot;Celluloid Heroes&quot;, 1972; &quot;Where Are They Now?&quot;, 1973; &quot;Sitting in the Midday Sun&quot;, 1973). On his 1967 song &quot;Waterloo Sunset&quot;, the singer finds a fleeting sense of contentment in the midst of urban drabness and solitude.

Davies&#x27;s mid-period work for the Kinks also showed signs of an emerging social conscience. For example, &quot;Holiday in Waikiki&quot; (1966) deplored the commercialization of a once unspoiled indigenous culture. Similarly, &quot;God&#x27;s Children&quot; and &quot;Apeman&quot; (both 1970), and the songs &quot;20th Century Man&quot;, &quot;Complicated Life&quot; and &quot;Here Come the People in Grey&quot; from &quot;Muswell Hillbillies&quot; (1971), passionately decried industrialization and bureaucracy in favour of simple pastoral living. Perhaps most significantly, the band&#x27;s acclaimed 1968 concept album &quot;The Kinks are the Village Green Preservation Society&quot; gave an affectionate embrace to &quot;Merry England&quot; nostalgia and advocated the preservation of traditional English country village and hamlet life.

A definitive testament to Davies&#x27;s reputation as a songwriter of insight, empathy and wit can be heard on the Kinks&#x27; landmark 1969 album &quot;Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)&quot;. Originally conceived as the soundtrack to a television play that was never produced, the band&#x27;s first rock opera affectionately chronicled the trials and tribulations of a working-class everyman and his family from the very end of the Victorian era through the First World War and Second World War, the postwar austerity years, and up to the 1960s. The overall theme of the record was partly inspired by the life of Ray and Dave Davies&#x27;s brother-in-law, Arthur Anning, who had married their elder sister Rose—herself the subject of an earlier Kinks song, &quot;Rosie Won&#x27;t You Please Come Home&quot; (1966)—and had emigrated to Australia after the war. Throughout a dozen evocative songs, &quot;Arthur&quot; fulfills its ambitious subtitle as Davies embellishes an intimate family chronicle with satirical observations about the shifting mores of the English working class in response to the declining fortunes of the British Empire.

The Kinks followed up &quot;Arthur&quot; with &quot;Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One&quot; (1970), a satirical take on the travails of the recording industry. This album proved to be another critical achievement as well as a commercial hit, spawning &quot;Lola&quot;, their first US Top Ten single since &quot;Tired of Waiting for You&quot; in 1965. &quot;Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One&quot; would also prove to be the band&#x27;s final album before signing with RCA Records. This period on the RCA label (1971–75) produced &quot;Muswell Hillbillies&quot;, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s in Show-Biz&quot;, &quot;Preservation Act 1&quot; and &quot;Act 2&quot;, &quot;Soap Opera&quot; and &quot;Schoolboys in Disgrace&quot;.

When the Kinks changed record labels from RCA to Arista in 1976, Davies abandoned his recent propensity for ambitious, theatrical concept albums and rock operas (see above) and returned to writing more basic, straightforward songs. During this decade the group founded their own London recording studio &quot;Konk&quot; which employed newer production techniques to achieve a more refined sound on the albums &quot;Sleepwalker&quot; (1977) and &quot;Misfits&quot; (1978). Davies&#x27;s focus shifted to wistful ballads of restless alienation (&quot;Life on the Road&quot;, &quot;Misfits&quot;), meditations on the inner lives of obsessed pop fans (&quot;Juke Box Music&quot;, &quot;A Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Fantasy&quot;), and exhortations of &quot;carpe diem&quot; (&quot;Life Goes On&quot;, &quot;Live Life&quot;, &quot;Get Up&quot;). A notable single from late 1977 reflected the contemporary influence of punk rock, &quot;Father Christmas&quot; (A-side) and &quot;Prince of the Punks&quot; (B-side—inspired by Davies&#x27;s troubled collaboration with Tom Robinson).

By the early 1980s, the Kinks revived their commercial fortunes considerably by adopting a much more mainstream arena rock style; and the band&#x27;s four remaining studio albums for Arista—&quot;Low Budget&quot; (1979), &quot;Give the People What They Want&quot; (1981), &quot;State of Confusion&quot; (1983) and &quot;Word of Mouth&quot; (1984)—showcased a decidedly canny and opportunistic approach. On &quot;(Wish I Could Fly Like) Superman&quot;, Davies vented his existential angst about the 1979 energy crisis over a thumping disco beat; on &quot;A Gallon of Gas&quot;, he addressed the same concern over a traditional acoustic twelve-bar blues shuffle. In contrast, &quot;Better Things&quot; (1981), &quot;Come Dancing&quot; (1982), &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget to Dance&quot; (1983) and &quot;Good Day&quot; (1984) were sentimental songs of hope and nostalgia for the aging Air Raid Generation. However, with &quot;Catch Me Now I&#x27;m Falling&quot; (1979), &quot;Destroyer&quot; (1981), &quot;Clichés of the World (B Movie)&quot; (1983) and &quot;Do It Again&quot; (1984), the Davies brothers cranked out strident, heavy-riffing hard rock that conveyed an attitude of bitter cynicism and world weary disillusionment.

==1990s–present==
Aside from the lengthy Kinks discography, Davies has released seven solo albums: the 1985 release &quot;Return to Waterloo&quot; (which accompanied a television film he wrote and directed), the 1998 release &quot;The Storyteller&quot;, &quot;Other People&#x27;s Lives&quot; in early 2006, &quot;Working Man&#x27;s Café&quot; in October 2007, &quot;The Kinks Choral Collection&quot; in June 2009, &quot;Americana&quot; in April 2017, and its sequel, &quot;Our Country: Americana Act II&quot; in June 2018.

In 1986, Davies contributed the track &quot;Quiet Life&quot; to the soundtrack of the Julien Temple film &quot;Absolute Beginners&quot; that is a musical film adapted from Colin MacInnes&#x27; book of the same name about life in late 1950s London. The song was released as a single. Davies appeared in the film, in which he also sang &quot;Quiet Life&quot;.

In 1990, Davies was inducted, with the Kinks, into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and, in 2005, into the UK Music Hall of Fame.

Davies published his &quot;unauthorised autobiography&quot;, &quot;X-Ray&quot;, in 1994. In 1997, he published a book of short stories entitled &quot;Waterloo Sunset&quot;. He has made three films, &quot;Return to Waterloo&quot; in 1985, &quot;Weird Nightmare&quot; (a documentary about Charles Mingus) in 1991, and &quot;Americana&quot;.

Davies was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire, by Queen Elizabeth II, in the 2004 New Year Honours.

In 2005, Davies released &quot;The Tourist&quot;, a four-song EP, in the UK; and &quot;Thanksgiving Day&quot;, a five-song EP, in the US.

A choral album, &quot;The Kinks Choral Collection&quot;, on which Davies had been collaborating with the Crouch End Festival Chorus since 2007, was released in the UK in June 2009 and in the US in November 2009. The album was re-released as a special extended edition including Davies&#x27;s charity Christmas single &quot;Postcard From London&quot; featuring Davies&#x27;s former girlfriend and leader of the Pretenders, Chrissie Hynde. The video for the single was directed by Julien Temple and features London landmarks including Waterloo Bridge, Carnaby Street, the statue of Eros steps and the Charlie Chaplin statue in Leicester Square. The duet was originally recorded with Kate Nash. His first choice had been Dame Vera Lynn.

In October 2009, Davies performed &quot;All Day and All of the Night&quot; with Metallica at the 25th Anniversary Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame Concert.

Davies was a judge for the 3rd (in 2004) and 7th (in 2008) annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists&#x27; careers.

Davies played at Glastonbury Festival in 2010, where he dedicated several songs to the Kinks&#x27; bassist Pete Quaife, who died a few days before the festival.

A collaborations album, &quot;See My Friends&quot;, was released in November 2010 with a US release to follow in early 2011.

2011 also marked Davies&#x27;s return to New Orleans, Louisiana, to play the Voodoo Experience Music festival. His setlist included material by the Kinks and solo material. That autumn, he toured with the 88 as his backing band. In August 2012, Davies performed &quot;Waterloo Sunset&quot; as part of the closing ceremony of the London 2012 Summer Olympics, watched by over 24 million viewers in the UK; the song was subsequently cut by NBC from the US broadcast, in favour of a preview of its upcoming show &quot;Animal Practice&quot;.

On 18 December 2015, Ray joined his brother Dave for an encore at London&#x27;s Islington Assembly Hall. The two performed &quot;You Really Got Me&quot;, marking the first time in nearly 20 years that the brothers had appeared and performed together.

In April 2017, Davies released the album &quot;Americana&quot;. Based on his experiences in the US it follows on from the short DVD &quot;Americana — a work in progress&quot; (found on the deluxe CD &quot;Working Man&#x27;s Cafe&quot; from 2007), and his biographical book &quot;Americana&quot; from 2013. A second volume &quot;Our Country: Americana Act II&quot; was released in June 2018. For his backing band on &quot;Americana&quot; Davies chose The Jayhawks, an alt-country/country-rock band from Minnesota.

He was knighted in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to the arts.

==Musicals==

In 1981, Davies collaborated with Barrie Keeffe in writing his first stage musical, &quot;Chorus Girls&quot;, which opened at the Theatre Royal Stratford East, London, starring Marc Sinden, and had a supporting cast of Michael Elphick, Anita Dobson, Lesley Manville, Kate Williams and Charlotte Cornwell. It was directed by Adrian Shergold, the choreography was by Charles Augins, and Jim Rodford played bass as part of the theatre&#x27;s &quot;house band&quot;.

Davies wrote songs for a musical version of Jules Verne&#x27;s &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot;; the show, &quot;80 Days&quot;, had a book by playwright Snoo Wilson. It was directed by Des McAnuff and ran at the La Jolla Playhouse&#x27;s Mandell Weiss Theatre in San Diego from 23 August to 9 October 1988. The musical received mixed responses from the critics. Davies&#x27;s multi-faceted music, McAnuff&#x27;s directing, and the acting, however, were well received, with the show winning the &quot;Best Musical&quot; award from the San Diego Theatre Critics Circle.

Davies&#x27;s musical &quot;Come Dancing&quot;, based partly on his 1983 hit single with 20 new songs, ran at the Theatre Royal Stratford East, London in September–November 2008.

&quot;Sunny Afternoon&quot;, a musical based on Ray Davies&#x27;s early life and featuring Kinks songs opened to critical acclaim at Hampstead Theatre. The musical moved to the Harold Pinter Theatre in London&#x27;s West End in October 2014. The musical won four awards at the 2015 Olivier Awards, including one for Ray Davies: the Autograph Sound Award for Outstanding Achievement in Music .

==Personal life==
Davies has been married three times and has four daughters. 

In 1964, he married Rasa Didzpetris. The couple had two daughters, Louisa and Victoria. 

He changed his legal name by deed poll to Raymond Douglas for five years, which allowed him anonymity for his second marriage in 1974 to Yvonne Gunner. The couple had no children and divorced in 1981. 

In the 1980s, Davies had a relationship with Chrissie Hynde of the Pretenders. The couple had a daughter, Natalie Rae Hynde. 

His third marriage was to Irish ballet dancer Patricia Crosbie, with whom he had a daughter named Eva.

In January 2004, Davies was shot in the leg while chasing thieves who had snatched his companion&#x27;s purse as they walked through the French Quarter of New Orleans. A man was arrested, but the charges were dropped because Davies had already returned to London and did not come back to New Orleans for the trial.

In June 2011, Davies&#x27; doctor ordered him to stay at home and rest for six months after blood clots were discovered in his lungs.

The name &quot;Aigues-Mortes&quot; was attested in 1248 in the Latinized form &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;dead water&quot;, or &quot;stagnant water&quot;. The name comes from the marshes and ponds that surround the village (which has never had potable water). The inhabitants of the commune are known as &quot;Aigues-Mortais&quot; or &quot;Aigues-Mortaises&quot; in French.

The Occitan &#x27; is equivalent to toponymic types in the Morteau Oil dialect cf. Morteau (Doubs): &quot;mortua Aqua&quot; (1105, VTF521) and Morteaue (Haute-Marne): &quot;mortua Aqua&quot; (1163, VTF521). in French means &quot;pond of the King&quot;. In Occitan, &#x27; means &quot;pond with extension&quot;.

==History==

===Antiquity===
The Roman general Gaius Marius is said to have founded Aigues-Mortes around 102 BC, but there is no documentary evidence to support this.

A Roman by the name of &quot;Peccius&quot; cultivated the first salt marsh and gave his name to the Marsh of Peccais. Salt mining started from the Neolithic period and was continued in the Hellenistic period, but the ancient uses of saline have not resulted in any major archaeological discovery. It is likely that any remains were destroyed by modern saline facilities.

===Middle Ages===


In 791, Charlemagne erected the amid the swamps for the safety of fishermen and salt workers. Some argue that the signaling and transmission of news was not foreign to the building of this tower which was designed to give warning in case of arrival of a fleet, as for the at Nîmes.

The purpose of this tower was part of the war plan and spiritual plan which Charlemagne granted at the Benedictine abbey, dedicated to &quot;Opus Dei&quot; (work of God) and whose incessant chanting, day and night, was to designate the convent as &quot;Psalmody&quot; or &quot;Psalmodi&quot;. This monastery still existed in 812, as confirmed by an act of endowment made by the Badila from Nîmes at the abbey.

At that time, the people lived in reed huts and made their living from fishing, hunting, and salt production from several small salt marshes along the sea shore. The region was then under the rule of the monks from the Abbey of Psalmody.

In 1240, Louis IX, who wanted to get rid of the dependency on the Italian maritime republics for transporting troops to the Crusades, focused on the strategic position of his kingdom. At that time, Marseille belonged to his brother Charles of Anjou, King of Naples, Agde to the Count of Toulouse, and Montpellier to the King of Aragon. Louis IX wanted direct access to the Mediterranean Sea. He obtained the town and the surrounding lands by exchange of properties with the monks of the abbey. Residents were exempt from the salt tax which was previously levied so that they could now take the salt unconstrained.

He built a road between the marshes and built the to serve as a watchtower and protect access to the city. Louis IX then built the on the site of the old Matafère Tower, to house the garrison. In 1272, his son and successor, Philip III the Bold, ordered the continuation of the construction of walls to encircle the small town completely. The work would not be completed for another 30 years.

This was the city from which Louis IX twice departed for the Seventh Crusade in 1248 and for the Eighth Crusade in 1270, where he died of dysentery at Tunis.

The year 1270 has been established, mistakenly for many historians, as the last step of a process initiated at the end of the 11th century. The judgment is hasty because the transfer of crusaders or mercenaries from the harbour of Aigues-Mortes continued after this year. The order given in 1275 to Sir Guillaume de Roussillon by Philip III the Bold and Pope Gregory X after the Council of Lyons in 1274 to reinforce Saint-Jean d&#x27;Acre in the East shows that maritime activity continued for a ninth crusade which never took place.

There is a popular belief that the sea reached Aigues-Mortes in 1270. In fact, as confirmed by studies of the engineer Charles Leon Dombre, the whole of Aigues-Mortes, including the port itself, was in the Marette pond, the &quot;Canal-Viel&quot; and &quot;Grau Louis&quot;, the Canal Viel being the access channel to the sea. The Grau-Louis was approximately at the modern location of La Grande-Motte.

At the beginning of the 14th century, Philip the Fair used the fortified site to incarcerate the Templars. Between 8 and 11 November 1307, forty-five of them were put to the question, found guilty, and held prisoner in the &quot;Tower of Constance&quot;.

===Modern and contemporary periods===
Aigues-Mortes still retained its privileges granted by the kings. The Protestant Jean d&#x27;Harambure &quot;the One-Eyed&quot;, light horse commander of King Henry IV and former governor of Vendôme was appointed governor of &quot;Aigues-Mortes&quot; and the Carbonnière Tower on 4 September 1607. To do this, he took an oath before the Constable of France Henri de Montmorency, Governor of Languedoc, who was a Catholic and supported the rival &quot;Adrien de Chanmont&quot;, the Lord of Berichère. The conflict continued until 1612, and Harambure, supported by the pastors of Lower Languedoc and the inhabitants, finished it by a personal appeal to the Queen. He eventually resigned on 27 February 1615 in favour of his son Jean d&#x27;Harambure, but King Louis XIII restored him for six years. On 27 July 1616 he resigned again in favour of Gaspard III de Coligny, but not without obtaining a token of appreciation for the judges and consuls of the city.

At the beginning of the 15th century, important works were being undertaken to facilitate access to &quot;Aigues-Mortes&quot; from the sea. The old &quot;Grau-Louis&quot;, dug for the Crusades, was replaced by the &quot;Grau-de-la-Croisette&quot; and a port was dug at the base of the Tower of Constance. It lost its importance from 1481 when Provence and Marseille were attached to the kingdom of France. Only the exploitation of the Peccais salt marshes encouraged François I, in 1532, to connect the salt industry of &quot;Aigues-Mortes&quot; to the sea. This channel, called &quot;Grau-Henry&quot;, silted up in turn. The opening, in 1752, of the &quot;Grau-du-Roi&quot; solved the problem for a while. A final solution was found in 1806 by connecting the Aigues-Mortes river port through the Canal du Rhône à Sète.
From 1575 to 1622, Aigues-Mortes was one of the eight safe havens granted to the Protestants. The revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 caused severe repression of Protestantism, which was marked in Languedoc and the Cévennes in the early 18th century by the Camisard War. Like other towers in the town, from 1686 onwards, the Constance Tower was used as a prison for the Huguenots who refused to convert to Roman Catholicism. In 1703, Abraham Mazel, leader of the Camisards, managed to escape with sixteen companions.

During the French Revolution, the city was called &quot;Port-Pelletier&quot;. At that time the port had almost disappeared due to silting, induced by the intensification of labour in the watershed at the same time as the clearing of woods and forests following the abolition of privileges. The decline of forest cover led to soil erosion and consequently a greater quantity of alluvial deposits in the ports of the region. Thus, in 1804 the prefect &quot;Mr. de Barante père&quot; wrote in a report that: &quot;The coasts of this department are more prone to silting ... The ports of Maguelonne and Aigues Mortes and the old port of Cette no longer exist except in history&quot; he alerted: &quot;An inordinate desire to collect and multiply these forest clearings since 1790 ... Greed has devoured in a few years the resource of the future, the mountains, opened to the plough, show that soon naked and barren rock, each groove becoming a ravine; the topsoil, driven by storms, has been brought into the rivers, and thence into the lower parts, where it serves every day to find the lowest parts and the darkest swamps.&quot;

===The massacre of Italians (August 1893)===
The Massacre of the Italians at Aigues-Mortes was a series of events on 16 and 17 August 1893 which resulted in the deaths of immigrant Italian workers of the &quot;Compagnie des Salins du Midi&quot;, at the hands of French villagers and labourers. Estimates range from the official number of eight deaths up to 150, according to the Italian press of the time. The case was also one of the greatest legal scandals of the time, since no convictions were ever made.

==Geography==
Aigues-Mortes is located in the some northwest of Marseille. By road, Aigues-Mortes is about southwest of Nîmes, and east of Montpellier in a direct line. Access to the commune is by route D979 coming south from Saint-Laurent-d&#x27;Aigouze to Aigues-Mortes town. Route D979 continues southwest through the commune to Le Grau-du-Roi. Route D62 also starts from Aigues-Mortes heading southwest parallel to D979 before turning eastwards and forming part of the southern border of the commune. Route D62A continues to Plan d&#x27;Eau du Vidourie.

The commune is composed of a portion of the wet plains and lakes of the Petite Camargue. It is separated from the Gulf of Lions (and, thus, the Mediterranean) by the town of Le Grau-du-Roi, however Aigues-Mortes is connected to the sea through the Canal du Rhône à Sète. There is only one other hamlet in the commune called Mas de Jarras Listel on the western border.

The Canal du Rhône à Sète enters the commune from the northwest and the northeast in two branches from the main canal to the north and the branches intersect in the town of Aigues-Mortes before exiting as a single canal alongside route D979 and feeding into the Mediterranean Sea at Le Grau-du-Roi.

A rail branch line from Nîmes passes through Aigues-Mortes from north-east to south-west, with a station in the town of Aigues-Mortes, to its terminus on the coast at Le-Grau-du-Roi. This line also transports sea salt.

The communes of Saint-Laurent-d&#x27;Aigouze and Le Grau-du-Roi are adjacent to the town of Aigues-Mortes. Its inhabitants are called &#x27; or &#x27;; in Occitan they are &quot;&quot;.

Aigues-Mortes is one of 79 member communes of the &#x27; of South Gard and is also one of 34 communes in the &quot;Pays Vidourle-Camargue&quot;. Aigues-Mortes is one of the four communes of the &#x27; of &quot;&quot; in the South of Gard.

===Climate===

Aigues-Mortes has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Csa&quot;). The average annual temperature in Aigues-Mortes is . The average annual rainfall is with October as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in July, at around , and lowest in January, at around . The highest temperature ever recorded in Aigues-Mortes was on 28 June 2019; the coldest temperature ever recorded was on 4 February 1963.

==Heraldry==
==Economy==

===Agriculture===
*Viticulture and asparagus
*Breeding of bulls and of Camargue horses. Both are raised almost wild in the surrounding marshes.
:The Camargue bull is smaller than the Spanish fighting bulls, stocky, with high horns and head. It measures about 1.40 m at the withers. It is primarily intended for bullfighting which is very popular in the region.
:The Camargue horse is the ultimate companion for herdsmen to move into the marshes and herd bulls. According to some discoveries of bones, it seems that the ancestors of the Camargue horse date to the Quaternary period. The Camargue horse is not very large, about 1.50 m tall. It has a huge resistance adapted to the terrain. Its colour is brown at birth, gradually turning white after a few years.

===Industries===
*Production of salt by the operation of the saltworks of the Salins group. Probably used since ancient times, the salt of Aigues-Mortes attracted fishermen and salt workers. The Benedictine monks settled nearby in the 8th century at the Abbey of Psalmodiet to exploit this valuable commodity in the Peccais Ponds. The salt has long been one of the main resources of the city. To achieve &quot;table salt quality&quot;, water pumped from the sea travels more than 70 km in &quot;roubines&quot;. The concentration of sodium chloride is from 29 to more than 260 g/kg. Mechanically harvested salt is piled up in the twinkling &quot;camelles&quot; before being packaged. It is suitable for human consumption.

===Tourism===
The medieval heritage from the 13th and 14th centuries of the commune and its proximity to the sea attract many tourists and residents of France.

==Transport==
===River===
The city of Aigues-Mortes is a crossroads of canals:
*Canal du Rhône à Sète from the north-east and leaving westward
*Canal de Bourgidou to the southeast, and joins the Petit Rhône via other channels to the limit of Gard and Bouches-du-Rhône
*Le Grau-du-Roi, maintained since the Middle Ages and connecting &quot;Aigues-Mortes&quot; to the central part of Grau-du-Roi

===Railway===
Aigues-Mortes station has rail connections to Nîmes and Le Grau-du-Roi. The railway line from Nîmes to Le Grau-du-Roi is also used for the transport of salt produced by the saltworks of the Salins Group (see link below).

===Road===
The development of seaside tourism since the 1960s was marked by the construction of new resorts (La Grande-Motte) and the extension of existing facilities from Le Grau du Roi to Port-Camargue. To facilitate access to tourists, a coastal road network has been augmented and connected to the A9 motorway. &quot;Aigues-Mortes&quot; benefits in these ways:
*to the east, the road D58 connects the city to Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer and the commune of Arles. This road winds through the rice fields and the various ponds that make up the Camargue.
*to the west, the road D62 was enlarged for cars to make a quick connection to Montpellier
*to the north, the road D979 directly connects the town to the motorway at Gallargues-le-Montueux

The bus 106 also connects Montpellier and Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer.

==Local culture==

===The Aigues-Mortes Fougasse===
&quot;Fougasse&quot; was one of the first pastries which could rise. It can be sweet (sometimes called &quot;tarte au sucre&quot; or sugar tart) or salty (with or without gratillons).

Traditionally, making sweet fougasse in &quot;Aigues-Mortes&quot; was reserved for the Christmas period, as part of the Thirteen desserts. Based on a brioche dough, sugar, butter, and orange blossom, it was made by the baker with ingredients provided by the client. Now Aigues-Mortes fougasse sells all year.

===Lou Drapé===
&quot;Lou Drapé&quot; is an imaginary horse mentioned in local folklore, which was supposed to walk at night around the ramparts of the city and take 50 to 100 children on his back, and disappear to &quot;nowhere&quot;.

== Historical sites ==
Aigues-Mortes has a very large number of sites registered as historical monuments and historical objects.

=== The Tower of Constance and the ramparts ===
The Tower of Constance was built in 1242 by Saint-Louis on the former site of the Matafère Tower which was built by Charlemagne around 790AD to house the king&#x27;s garrison. The construction was completed in 1254.

It is 22 metres in diameter with a height of either 33 or 40 metres depending on the source. The thickness of the walls at the base is 6 metres.

On the ground floor, there is a guardroom protected by a portcullis. In the middle of the room, there is a circular opening leading to the cellar which served as a pantry, storage of ammunition as well as for dungeons. These areas were called the &quot;culs de basse fosse&quot;, an old way of saying underground dungeons in French.

On the first floor, there is the knight&#x27;s hall. Structurally it is similar to the guardroom. It was in this room that the Protestants were imprisoned during the 18th century, most notably Marie Durand, who engraved the word &quot;résister&quot; (English: resist) into the edge of the well which can be seen to this day. She was imprisoned at the age of 19, and was freed 38 years later, along with political prisoners such as Abraham Mazel, leader of the Camisards.

Between these two rooms, a narrow, covered way was built within the walls to keep watch on the room below.

After the knight&#x27;s hall, there is an entrance to the terrace which offers a wide panoramic view of the region, making it an ideal position for surveillance. Sometimes, the prisoners were allowed to go on the terrace to get some fresh air.

The ramparts stretch for a distance of 1650 metres.
Spectacular in their height and their state of preservation even though they were not restored in the 19th century, as was Carcassonne for example, they remain in a well preserved state. Along with the &quot;Tower of Constance&quot;, they are a testimony to Western European military architecture in the marshlands during the 13th and 14th centuries.

===The Carbonnière Tower===
Located in the commune of Saint-Laurent-d&#x27;Aigouze, the Carbonnière Tower was first referred to in an old text from 1346 specifying the function of the structure. It said, &quot;this fortress is the key to the kingdom in this region.&quot; Surrounded by salt marshes, the fortress was the only passageway into &quot;Aigues-Mortes&quot;. It was guarded by a garrison made up of a châtelain and several guards. From the terrace, which could support up to four cannons, there is a panoramic view of Petite Camargue.
=== The Church of Notre-Dame-des-Sablons ===
The Church of Notre-Dame-des-Sablons is a Gothic-style church and was probably built before the ramparts in the mid-13th century during the time of Saint-Louis. In 1537 it served as a Collegiate church but was later vandalized by Protestants in 1575. After the reconstruction of the bell tower in 1634 it later served as a Temple of Reason during the French Revolution, a barracks, grain merchant, and a salt warehouse. It was re-established as a place of worship in 1804 and the building was restored in the neo classical-baroque style. Between 1964 and 1967 all of the 19th century decor was removed, notably the coffered ceilings, resulting in the much more basic and medieval style church we see today. Since 1991, the stained-glass windows by Claude Viallat, a contemporary artist belonging to the Supports/Surfaces art movement, add extraordinary light and colour to the building. With the exception of a few statues, the rest of the 18th and 19th century furniture disappeared during this period. The façade is crowned by a simple bell-gable housing 3 bells. The largest of the three is 1.07 metres in diameter. It was dated to 1740, cast by master smelter Jean Poutingon, and has been designated a historical monument of France. The church also houses a statue of Saint-Louis.
===The Chapel of the Gray Penitents===
The Chapel of the Gray Penitents is located to the east of the &quot;Place de la Viguerie&quot;. It is the property of the Brotherhood of Grey Penitents established in 1400. The facade is in the style of Louis XIV. The entrance door is from the 17th century and is decorated with a wooden statue. The altarpiece was carved in 1687 by &quot;Sabatier&quot;.

Inside, an altarpiece represents the passion of Christ. It was built of gray stucco plaster in 1687 by the sculptor &quot;Sabatier&quot; from Montpellier. This altar, on which are the arms of the brotherhood, occupies the back of the choir.

===The Chapel of the White Penitents===
The Chapel of the White Penitents is located at the corner of the &quot;Rue de la République&quot; and &quot;Rue Louis Blanc&quot;. It belongs to the Brotherhood of the White Penitents which was created in 1622.

Above the choir, on the roof, there is a copy of the Retable of Jerusalem where Christ celebrated the Passover and Holy Thursday with his apostles. Around the high altar, a painting on canvas traces the descent of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost. It is attributed to Xavier Sigalon a painter born in Uzès in 1778 . On each side of the choir stand two statues: on the left Saint Felix for the redemption of captives, on the right James, son of Alphaeus, first Bishop of Jerusalem.

===Saint-Louis Square===
This is the touristic heart of the city. In the centre, opposite the main entrance of the &quot;Porte de la Gardette&quot;, stands the statue of Saint-Louis, the work of James Pradier in 1849.

===Plan des Theatres===
The Plan des Theatres are arenas for the Camargue bullfights. They were listed in 1993 on the inventory of the list of Historic Monuments (MH) for their ethnological and cultural interest. They can accommodate more than 600 people.

<text>An Ironman Triathlon is one of a series of long-distance triathlon races organized by the World Triathlon Corporation (WTC), consisting of a swim, a bicycle ride and a marathon run completed in that order, a total of . It is widely considered one of the most difficult one-day sporting events in the world.

Most Ironman events have a time limit of 16 or 17 hours to complete the race, course dependent, with the race typically starting at 7:00 am. The mandatory cutoff time to complete the swim is 2 hours 20 minutes. The mandatory bike cut-off time for when an athlete must have completed their swim, transition, and bike varies generally between 10 hours and 10 hours 30 minutes from when an athlete began their swim. The mandatory run cutoff varies between 16 and 17 hours from when athlete began their swim. Many races will also have intermediate bike, run, and transition cut off times specific to each race venue. Any participant who completes the triathlon within these time constraints is designated an Ironman.

The name &quot;Ironman Triathlon&quot; is also associated with the original Ironman triathlon that is now the Ironman World Championship. Held in Kailua-Kona, the world championship has been held annually in Hawaii since 1978 (with an additional race in 1982). Originally taking place in Oahu, the race moved to Kailua-Kona in 1981 and it continues today. The Ironman World Championship has become known for its grueling length, harsh race conditions, and television coverage.

There are other races that are the same distance as an Ironman triathlon but are not produced, owned, or licensed by the WTC. They include The Challenge Family series&#x27; Challenge Roth and the Norseman Triathlon.

The event series is owned by The Ironman Group, which is owned by Advance Publications, following the acquisition from the Wanda Sports Group in August 2020.

==History==

The idea for the original Ironman Triathlon arose during the awards ceremony for the 1977 Oʻahu Perimeter Relay. Among the participants were representatives of both the Mid-Pacific Road Runners and the Waikiki Swim Club, whose members had long been debating which athletes were more fit, runners or swimmers. On this occasion, U.S. Navy Commander John Collins pointed out that a recent article in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine had declared that Belgian cyclist Eddy Merckx had the highest recorded &quot;oxygen uptake&quot; of any athlete ever measured, so perhaps cyclists were more fit than anyone. Collins and his wife Judy Collins had taken part in the triathlons staged in 1974 and 1975 by the San Diego Track Club in and around Mission Bay, California, as well as the 1975 Optimist Sports Fiesta Triathlon in Coronado, California. A number of the other military athletes in attendance were also familiar with the San Diego races, so they understood the concept when Collins suggested that the debate should be settled through a race combining the three existing long-distance competitions already on the island: the Waikiki Roughwater Swim (), the Around-Oahu Bike Race (; originally a two-day event) and the Honolulu Marathon ().

Until that time, no one present had ever done the bike race. Collins figured by shaving off the course and riding counter-clockwise around the island, the bike leg could start at the finish of the Waikiki Rough Water and end at the Aloha Tower, the traditional start of the Honolulu Marathon. Prior to racing, each athlete received three sheets of paper listing a few rules and a course description. Handwritten on the last page was this exhortation: &quot;Swim 2.4 miles! Bike 112 miles! Run 26.2 miles! Brag for the rest of your life&quot;, now a registered trademark.

With a nod to a local runner who was notorious for his demanding workouts, Collins said, &quot;Whoever finishes first, we&#x27;ll call &quot;him&quot; the Iron Man.&quot; Each of the racers had their own support crew to supply water, food and encouragement during the event. Of the fifteen men to start off in the early morning on February 18, 1978, twelve completed the race. Gordon Haller, a U.S. Navy Communications Specialist, was the first to earn the title Ironman by completing the course with a time of 11 hours, 46 minutes, 58 seconds. The runner-up John Dunbar, a U.S. Navy SEAL, led after the second transition and had a chance to win but ran out of water on the marathon course; his support crew resorted to giving him beer instead.

With no further marketing efforts, the race gathered as many as 50 athletes in 1979. The race, however, was postponed a day because of bad weather conditions. Only fifteen competitors started off the race Sunday morning. San Diego&#x27;s Tom Warren won in 11 hours, 15 minutes, 56 seconds. Lyn Lemaire, a championship cyclist from Boston, placed sixth overall and became the first &quot;Ironwoman&quot;. Lemaire finished her race in 12 hours 55 minutes and 38 seconds, only 1 hour 39 minutes and 42 seconds slower than the winning time for the men&#x27;s race. Collins planned on changing the race into a relay event to draw more participants, but &quot;Sports Illustrated&#x27;s&quot; journalist Barry McDermott, in the area to cover a golf tournament, discovered the race and wrote a ten-page account of it. During the following year, hundreds of curious participants contacted Collins. In 1980, 27-year-old Dave Scott broke the then-record by close to 2 hours, completing the race in 9 hours and 24 minutes. For the 1981 event, there were more than triple the entries, at 326.

There have been 19 different ways to qualify for the Ironman. Some of the ways include being a Hawaii Resident who won an event drawing, attaining a win in your age group at a previous Ironman, or even having a &quot;Human Interest Story.&quot; Such human interest stories include participants who are cancer survivors and war heroes injured in battle.

===Valerie Silk and WTC===
Around 1979 Collins no longer wanted to direct the Ironman race and approached Nautilus Fitness Center owners Hank Grundman and Valerie Silk about taking over control of the race. Grundman previously had extended his club&#x27;s facilities to many of the Ironman competitors. Following the couple&#x27;s divorce in 1981 Silk received ownership of Ironman. That year she moved the competition to the less urbanized Hawaii Island (called the Big Island) and in 1982 moved the race date from February to October; as a result of this change there were two Ironman Triathlon events in 1982.

A milestone in the marketing of the legend and history of the race happened in February 1982. Julie Moss, a college student competing to gather research for her exercise physiology thesis, moved toward the finish line in first place. As she neared the finish, severe fatigue and dehydration set in, and she fell just yards away from the finish line. Although Kathleen McCartney passed her for the women&#x27;s title, Moss nevertheless crawled to the finish line. Her performance was broadcast worldwide and created the Ironman mantra that just finishing is a victory. By the end of that year, the race had maxed out at 1,000 participants, with a lottery used to fill the field while turning away another 1,000 interested participants.

In 1990, with the help of Lew Friedland, Dr. James P. Gills acquired and purchased the Hawaii Triathlon Corporation, owner of the Ironman brand for $3 million from Silk. With the Ironman brand, Gills established the World Triathlon Corporation with the intention of furthering the sport of triathlon and increasing prize money for triathletes.

A number of non-WTC full distance triathlons have been held since the mid-1990s. The limited number of WTC-sanctioned events, and the limited number of entries available per race, have combined with a growth in the sport that has created demand for these non-trademarked events. Many of them share the , , format with the Ironman triathlon. Originally, many used the Ironman name. Due to aggressive trademark protection, most of these races no longer use the word &quot;Ironman&quot;.

==Today==
The Ironman format remains unchanged, and the Hawaiian Ironman is still regarded as an honored and prestigious triathlon event to win worldwide. For the 2024 Ironman Triathlon, the men&#x27;s race will be held in Kona, Hawaii in October and the women&#x27;s race will be held in Nice, France in September.

People completing such an event within the strict event time cutoffs are agreed to be recognized as &quot;Ironmen&quot;; the plural &quot;Ironmans&quot; refers to multiples of &quot;Ironman&quot; as a short form of &quot;Ironman Triathlon.&quot; In the triathlon community, an Ironman is someone who has completed a race of the appropriate distance, whether or not it falls under the aegis of WTC.

==Swim Smart Initiative==
In 2013, Ironman piloted the &quot;Swim Smart Initiative&quot; in North America and brought with it some notable safety-related changes to the Ironman format. These changes included new rules regarding swim course formats, water temperature regulations, pre-swim warm-ups, wave starts, and additional rescue boats/watercraft (paddle boards, kayaks, etc.). The Swim Smart Initiative also introduced &quot;resting rafts&quot; so that athletes may leave the water to rest without being disqualified. Andrew Messick, CEO of the World Triathlon Corporation, wanted the Swim Smart Initiative to ease the stress of the open swim and allowing athletes to be confident in the swim. Removing the &quot;mass start&quot; and conducting a &quot;roll start&quot; has been one of the major changes the organization has made.

==Ironman World Championship==
Over time, the popularity of the triathlon grew, and the annual race on the Big Island became The Ironman World Championship. In 1983, admission to the race began following a qualification-based system, whereby athletes had to obtain entry to the race by competing in another Ironman race and gaining a slot allocated on a proportional basis. The Hawaii race consists of a swim in the bay of Kailua-Kona, a bike ride across the Hawaiian lava desert to Hāwī and back, and a marathon run along the coast (from Keauhou to Keahole Point and back to Kailua-Kona); finishing on Alii Drive. The most recent Ironman World Championship took place on October 6, 2022, and was won by Gustav Iden of Norway in 7:40:24 and Chelsea Sodaro of the United States in 8:33:46.

The current Ironman Hawaii course record was set in 2022 by Gustav Iden (Norway), whose winning time was 7 hours 40 minutes 24 seconds. Daniela Ryf (Switzerland) set the women&#x27;s course record in 2018 with a winning time of 8 hours 26 minutes 18 seconds.

Amateur triathletes can qualify for the World Championship by placing in one of the other Ironman series races. Entry into the race can also be obtained through various contests and promotions or through the Ironman Foundation&#x27;s charitable eBay auction.

==Training studies==
Many studies have been conducted to enhance the performance of the athletes who are training for the Ironman Triathlons, while others studied the effects training has on the body and mind. In one study done by Clifford B. Sowell and Wm. Stewart Mounts Jr., &quot;men who are 65 years old are 44% slower than one who is 35...and women is 48%&quot;

== Athlete injuries ==

Triathletes train year-round, and no matter how cautious, injuries are always possible. Many factors can account for injuries happening; intrinsic factors are based on the individual, and extrinsic factors are environmentally influenced. The most common injuries in the running event, are to the ankle and foot which result in a sprain, fracture, and muscle strain. Knee injuries like patella tendinopathy. Lower back injuries such as intervertebral disc injury and myofascial pain. Cycling injuries are common in the knees, lower back, neck, and shoulder. Swimming injuries happen most in the shoulders from the continuous rotations. The neck will see some minor injury when you are only breathing from one side. Thermal injuries can occur when the athlete is dehydrated, hyperthermic, or hypothermic.

==Ironman series==
There are over three dozen Ironman Triathlon races throughout the world that enable qualification for the Ironman World Championships. Professional athletes qualify for the championship through a point ranking system, where points are earned based on their final placement in Ironman and Ironman 70.3 events. The top 50 male and top 35 female professionals in points qualify for the championship. Amateur athletes qualify for the championship by receiving slots allocated to each age group&#x27;s top finishers in a qualifying event. The Ironman qualifying events include:

==Ironman world records==
The designation of &quot;world record&quot; is unofficial due to lack of course certification as well as World Triathlon Corporation not maintaining official world record status.

==Ironman 70.3==
In 2005, WTC instituted the Ironman 70.3 race series. This shorter course, also known as a Half Ironman, consists of a swim, bike ride, and run. As with the Ironman series, it consists of a number of qualifying races at various locations worldwide ending in a world championship race with athletes drawn largely from top finishers in the qualifying events.

For amateur athletes, some 70.3 events acted as qualifiers for the full Ironman World Championships in Hawaii. However, the 2015 qualifying year marked a large de-emphasis on using certain Ironman 70.3 series races as a path for amateur athletes to qualify for the Ironman World Championships. The change was made to accommodate for the increased number of qualifying slots created from the full Ironman events which had been recently added.

For professional triathletes, up to three 70.3 events can be used to accumulate points to be put towards their championship qualifying point rankings.

==Ownership and trademark==

Advance Publications, the parent company that owns WTC and subsequently the Ironman brand, pays royalties to Marvel Entertainment for use of the Ironman brand. As part of the licensing agreement both Marvel and the former owner Wanda agreed to not use the &quot;Iron Man&quot; and &quot;Ironman&quot; trademarks in ways that would suggest an association with the other or cause brand confusion. World Triathlon Corporation CEO Andrew Messick has stated that the agreement has been in place for decades and the royalties paid are &quot;not material to the business.&quot; Iron Man first appeared in 1963, whereas the first Ironman triathlon was raced in 1978.

The Ironman Triathlon logo is a trademark of the World Triathlon Corporation. The WTC has also registered the trademarks for &quot;Ironman,&quot; &quot;Ironman Triathlon,&quot; &quot;M-Dot,&quot; and &quot;70.3.&quot; WTC has licensed the Ironman name for use, such as in the line of Timex Ironman wristwatches.

<text>Hubei is a province in Central China. It has the seventh-largest economy among Chinese provinces, the second-largest within Central China, and the third-largest among inland provinces. Its provincial capital at Wuhan serves as a major political, cultural, and economic hub for the region.

Hubei is associated with the historical state of E that existed during the Western Zhou dynasty (771 BCE). Its name means &#x27;north of the lake&#x27;, referring to Dongting Lake. It borders Henan to the north, Anhui and Jiangxi to the east, Hunan to the south, and Chongqing and Shaanxi to the west. The high-profile Three Gorges Dam is located at Yichang in the west of the province.

== History ==

The Hubei region was home to sophisticated Neolithic cultures. By the Spring and Autumn period (770–476 BC), the territory of today&#x27;s Hubei formed part of the powerful State of Chu. Chu, nominally a tributary state of the Zhou dynasty, was itself an extension of the Chinese civilization that had emerged some centuries before in the north; but Chu also represented a culturally unique blend of northern and southern culture, and it developed into a powerful state that controlled much of the middle and lower Yangtze River, with its power extending northwards into the North China Plain.
During the Warring States period (475–221 BC) Chu became the major adversary of the upstart State of Qin to the northwest (in present-day Guanzhong, Shaanxi province), which began to assert itself by outward expansionism. As wars between Qin and Chu ensued, Chu lost more and more land: first its dominance over the Sichuan Basin, then (in 278 BC) its heartland, which correspond to modern Hubei. In 223 BC Qin chased down the remnants of the Chu regime, which had fled eastwards during Qin&#x27;s wars of uniting China.

Qin founded the Qin dynasty in 221 BC, the first unified dynasty in China. The Qin dynasty was succeeded in 206 BC by the Han dynasty, which established the province (&quot;zhou&quot;) of Jingzhou in today&#x27;s Hubei and Hunan. The Qin and Han played an active role in the extension of farmland in Hubei, maintaining a system of river dikes to protect farms from summer floods. Towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty in the beginning of the 3rd century, Jingzhou was ruled by regional warlord Liu Biao. After his death in 208, Liu Biao&#x27;s realm was surrendered by his successors to Cao Cao, a powerful warlord who had conquered nearly all of north China; but in the Battle of Red Cliffs (208 or 209), warlords Liu Bei and Sun Quan drove Cao Cao out of Jingzhou. Liu Bei then took control of Jingzhou and appointed Guan Yu as administrator of Xiangyang (in modern Xiangyang, Hubei) to guard Jing province; he went on to conquer Yizhou (the Sichuan Basin), but lost Jingzhou to Sun Quan; for the next few decades Jingzhou was controlled by the Wu Kingdom, ruled by Sun Quan and his successors.

The incursion of northern nomadic peoples into the region at the beginning of the 4th century (Five Barbarians&#x27; rebellion and Disaster of Yongjia
(永嘉之乱)) began nearly three centuries of division into a nomad-ruled (but increasingly Sinicized) north and a Han Chinese-ruled south. Hubei, to the south, remained under southern rule for this entire period, until the unification of China by the Sui dynasty in 589. In 617 the Tang dynasty replaced Sui, and later on the Tang dynasty placed present-day Hubei under the jurisdiction of several circuits: Jiangnanxi Circuit in the south; Shannandong Circuit (山南东道) in the west, and Huainan Circuit in the east. After the Tang dynasty disintegrated in the early 10th century, Hubei came under the control of several regional regimes: Jingnan in the center, Yang Wu and its successor Southern Tang to the east, the Five Dynasties to the north and Shu to Shizhou (施州, in modern Enshi, Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture).

The Song dynasty reunified the region in 982 and placed most of Hubei into Jinghubei Circuit, a longer version of Hubei&#x27;s current name. Mongols conquered the region in 1279, and under their rule the province of Huguang was established, covering Hubei, Hunan, and parts of Guangdong and Guangxi. During the Mongol rule, in 1331, Hubei was devastated by an outbreak of the Black Death, which reached England, Belgium, and Italy by June 1348, and which, according to Chinese sources, spread during the following three centuries to decimate populations throughout Eurasia.

The Ming dynasty (1368–1644) drove out the Mongols in 1368. Their version of Huguang province was smaller, and corresponded almost entirely to the modern provinces of Hubei and Hunan combined. Hubei lay geographically outside the centers of the Ming power. During the last years of the Ming, today&#x27;s Hubei was ravaged several times by the rebel armies of Zhang Xianzhong and Li Zicheng. The Manchu Qing dynasty which took control of much of the region in 1644, soon split Huguang into the modern provinces of Hubei and Hunan. The Qing dynasty, however, continued to maintain a Viceroy of Huguang, one of the most well-known viceroys being Zhang Zhidong (in office between 1889 and 1907), whose modernizing reforms made Hubei (especially Wuhan) into a prosperous center of commerce and industry. The Huangshi/Daye area, south-east of Wuhan, became an important center of mining and metallurgy.

In 1911, the Wuchang Uprising took place in modern-day Wuhan. The uprising started the Xinhai Revolution, which overthrew the Qing dynasty and established the Republic of China. In 1927 Wuhan became the seat of a government established by left-wing elements of the Kuomintang, led by Wang Jingwei; this government later merged into Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s government in Nanjing. During World War II the eastern parts of Hubei were conquered and occupied by Japan, while the western parts remained under Chinese control.

During the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s, Wuhan saw fighting between rival Red Guard factions. In July 1967, civil strife struck the city in the Wuhan Incident (&quot;July 20th Incident&quot;), an armed conflict between two hostile groups who were fighting for control over the city at the height of the Cultural Revolution.

As the fears of a nuclear war increased during the time of Sino-Soviet border conflicts in the late 1960s, the Xianning prefecture of Hubei was chosen as the site of Project 131, an underground military-command headquarters.
The province—and Wuhan in particular—suffered severely from the 1954 Yangtze River Floods. Large-scale dam construction followed, with the Gezhouba Dam on the Yangtze River near Yichang started in 1970 and completed in 1988; the construction of the Three Gorges Dam, further upstream, began in 1993. In the following years, authorities resettled millions of people from western Hubei to make way for the construction of the dam. A number of smaller dams have been constructed on the Yangtze&#x27;s tributaries as well.

The Xianning Nuclear Power Plant is planned in Dafanzhen, Tongshan County, Xianning, to host at least four 1,250-megawatt (MW) AP1000 pressurized-water reactors.
Work on the site began in 2010; plans envisaged that the first reactor would start construction in 2011 and go online in 2015. However, construction of the first phase had yet to start .

On 1 December 2019, the first case of COVID-19 in the COVID-19 pandemic was identified in the city of Wuhan. In January 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 virus was officially identified, leading local and federal governments to implement massive quarantine zones across Hubei province, especially in the capital Wuhan (the epicenter of the outbreak). Authorities partially or fully locked down 15 cities, directly affecting 57 million people. Following severe outbreaks in numerous other countries, including in different areas of the world, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020. However, after more than eight weeks, the lockdown on most cities in the province was lifted.

== Geography ==
The Jianghan Plain takes up most of central and southern Hubei, while the west and the peripheries are more mountainous, with ranges such as the Wudang Mountains, the Jing Mountains, the Daba Mountains, and the Wu Mountains (in rough north-to-south order). The Dabie Mountains lie to the northeast of the Jianghan Plain, on the border with Henan and Anhui; the Tongbai Mountains lie to the north on the border with Henan; to the southeast, the Mufu Mountains form the border with Jiangxi. The highest peak in Hubei is Shennong Peak, found in the Daba Mountains of the forestry area of Shennongjia; it has an altitude of 3105 m.

The two major rivers of Hubei are the Yangtze River and its left tributary, the Han River; they lend their names to the Jianghan Plain – Jiang representing the Yangtze and han representing the Han River. The Yangtze River enters Hubei from the west via the Three Gorges; the eastern half of the Three Gorges (Xiling Gorge and part of Wu Gorge) lie in western Hubei, while the western half is in neighbouring Chongqing. The Han River enters the province from the northwest. After crossing most of the province, the two great rivers meet at the center of Wuhan, the provincial capital.

Among the notable tributaries of the Yangtze within the province are the Shen Nong Stream (a small northern tributary, severely affected by the Three Gorges Dam project); the Qing, a major waterway of southwestern Hubei; the Huangbo near Yichang; and the Fushui River in the southeast.

Thousands of lakes dot the landscape of Hubei&#x27;s Jianghan Plain, giving Hubei the name of &quot;Province of Lakes&quot;; the largest of these lakes are Liangzi Lake and Hong Lake. The numerous hydrodams have created a number of large reservoirs, the largest of which is the Danjiangkou Reservoir on the Han River, on the border between Hubei and Henan.

Hubei has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot; or &quot;Cwa&quot; under the Köppen climate classification), with four distinct seasons. Winters are cool to cold, with average temperatures of in January, while summers are hot and humid, with average temperatures of in July; punishing temperatures of or above are widely associated with Wuhan, the provincial capital. The mountainous districts of western Hubei, in particular Shennongjia, with their cooler summers, attract numerous visitors from Wuhan and other lowland cities.

Besides the capital Wuhan, other important cities are Jingmen; Shiyan, a center of automotive industry and the gateway to the Wudang Mountains; Yichang, the main base for the gigantic hydroelectric projects of southwestern Hubei; and Shashi.

== Administrative divisions ==

Hubei is divided into thirteen prefecture-level divisions (of which there are twelve prefecture-level cities (including a sub-provincial city) and one autonomous prefecture), as well as three directly administered county-level cities (all sub-prefecture-level cities) and one directly administered county-level forestry area. At the end of 2017, the total population was 59.02 million.

The thirteen Prefecture and four directly administered county-level divisions of Hubei are subdivided into 103 county-level divisions (39 districts, 24 county-level cities, 37 counties, 2 autonomous counties, 1 forestry district; the directly administered county-level divisions are included here). Those are in turn divided into 1234 township-level divisions (737 towns, 215 townships, nine ethnic townships, and 273 subdistricts).

== Economy ==

Hubei is often called the &quot;Land of Fish and Rice&quot; (). Important agricultural products in Hubei include cotton, rice, wheat, and tea, while industries include automobiles, metallurgy, machinery, power generation, textiles, foodstuffs and high-tech commodities.

Mineral resources that can be found in Hubei in significant quantities include borax, hongshiite, wollastonite, garnet, marlstone, iron, phosphorus, copper, gypsum, rutile, rock salt, gold amalgam, manganese and vanadium. The province&#x27;s recoverable reserves of coal stand at 548 million tons, which is modest compared to other Chinese provinces. Hubei is well known for its mines of fine turquoise and green faustite.

Hubei was a major recipient of China&#x27;s investment in industrial capacity during the Third Front campaign.

Since completion in 2012, the Three Gorges Dam in western Hubei provides plentiful hydroelectricity, with an average annual power production of 95 Twh. Existing hydroelectric stations include Gezhouba, Danjiangkou, Geheyan, Hanjiang, Duhe, Huanglongtan, Bailianhe, Lushui and Fushui.

Hubei is the 7th-largest provincial economy of China, the second largest in the Central China region after Henan, the third largest in the South Central China region after Guangdong and Henan and the third largest among inland provinces after Henan and Sichuan. , Hubei&#x27;s nominal GDP was US$787 billion (CNY 5 trillion). Its GDP (nominal) per capita exceeded US$13,000, making it the richest landlocked province, the richest province in the Central China region, and 2nd richest province in South Central China region after Guangdong.

=== Economic and Technological Development Zones ===
* Hubei Jingzhou Chengnan Economic Development Zone was established in 1992 under the approval of Hubei Government. Three major industries include textile, petroleum and chemical processing, with a combined output accounts for 90% of its total output. The zone also enjoys a well-developed transportation network—only to the airport and to the railway station.
* Wuhan East Lake High-Tech Development Zone is a national level high-tech development zone. Optical-electronics, telecommunications, and equipment manufacturing are the core industries of Wuhan East Lake High-Tech Development Zone (ELHTZ) while software outsourcing and electronics are also encouraged. ELHTZ is China&#x27;s largest production centre for optical-electronic products with key players like Changfei Fiber-optical Cables (the largest fiber-optical cable maker in China), Fenghuo Telecommunications and Wuhan Research Institute of Post and Telecommunications (the largest research institute in optical telecommunications in China). Wuhan ELHTZ represents the development centre for China&#x27;s laser industry with key players such as HUST Technologies and Chutian Laser being based in the zone.
* Wuhan Economic and Technological Development Zone is a national level industrial zone incorporated in 1993. Its size is about 10–25 square km and it plans to expand to 25–50 square km. Industries encouraged in Wuhan Economic and Technological Development Zone include automobile production/assembly, biotechnology/pharmaceuticals, chemicals production and processing, food/beverage processing, heavy industry, and telecommunications equipment.

Wuhan Optics Valley Software Park is jointly developed by East Lake High-Tech Development Zone and Dalian Software Park Co., Ltd. The planned area is with total floor area of 600,000 square meters. The zone is from the 316 National Highway and is from the Wuhan Tianhe Airport.
* Xiangyang New &amp; Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone

== Demographics ==

Han Chinese form the dominant ethnic group in Hubei. A considerable Miao and Tujia population live in the southwestern part of the province, especially in Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture.

On October 18, 2009, Chinese officials began to relocate 330,000 residents from the Hubei and Henan provinces that will be affected by the Danjiangkou Reservoir on the Han river. The reservoir is part of the larger South-North Water Transfer Project.
=== Religion ===
The predominant religions in Hubei are Chinese folk religions, Taoist traditions and Chinese Buddhism. According to surveys conducted in 2007 and 2009, 6.5% of the population believes and is involved in cults of ancestors, while 0.58% of the population identifies as Christian, declining from 0.83% in 2004. The reports did not give figures for other types of religion; 92.92% of the population may be either irreligious or involved in worship of nature deities, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, folk religious sects.

== Culture ==


People in Hubei speak Mandarin dialects; most of these dialects are classified as Southwestern Mandarin dialects, a group that also encompasses the Mandarin dialects of most of southwestern China.

Perhaps the most celebrated element of Hubei cuisine is the Wuchang bream, a freshwater bream that is commonly steamed.

Types of traditional Chinese opera popular in Hubei include Hanju and Chuju ().

The Shennongjia area is the alleged home of the &quot;Yeren&quot;, a wild undiscovered hominid that lives in the forested hills.

The people of Hubei are given the uncomplimentary nickname &quot;Nine-headed Birds&quot; by other Chinese, from a mythological creature said to be very aggressive and hard to kill. &quot;In the sky live nine-headed birds. On the earth live Hubei people.&quot; ()

Wuhan is one of the major culture centers in China.

Hubei is thought to be the province that originated the card game of &quot;dou dizhu&quot;.

== Education ==
As of 2022, Hubei hosts 130 institutions of higher education, ranking sixth together with Hunan (130) among all Chinese provinces after Jiangsu (168), Guangdong (160), Henan (156), Shandong (153), and Sichuan (134). The Huazhong University of Science and Technology(HUST), Wuhan University and many other institutions in Wuhan make it a hub of higher education and research in China. Wuhan is the city that has the largest college student population in the world (1.3 million) studying in its 89 universities.

== Transportation ==

Prior to the construction of China&#x27;s national railway network, the Yangtze and Hanshui Rivers had been the main transportation arteries of Hubei for many centuries, and still continue to play an important transport role.

Historically, Hubei&#x27;s overland transport network was hampered by the lack of bridges across the Yangtze River, which divides the province into northern and southern regions. The first bridge across the Yangtze in Hubei, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was completed in 1957, followed by the Zhicheng Bridge in 1971. , Hubei had 23 bridges and tunnels across the Yangtze River, including nine bridges and three tunnels in Wuhan.

=== Rail ===
The railway from Beijing reached Wuhan in 1905, and was later extended to Guangzhou, becoming the first north-to-south railway mainline to cross China. A number of other lines crossed the province later on, including the Jiaozuo–Liuzhou railway and Beijing–Kowloon railway, respectively, in the western and eastern part of the province.

The first decade of the 21st century has seen a large amount of new railway construction in Hubei. The Wuhan–Guangzhou high-speed railway, roughly parallel to the original Wuhan-Guangzhou line, opened in late 2009, it was subsequently extended to the north, to Beijing becoming the Beijing–Guangzhou high-speed railway. An east-west high-speed corridor connecting major cities along the Yangtze, the Shanghai–Wuhan–Chengdu passenger railway was gradually opened between 2008 and 2012, the Wuhan–Yichang railway section of it opening in 2012. The Wuhan–Xiaogan intercity railway was opened in December 2016 and it was extended when the Wuhan–Shiyan high-speed railway opened in November 2019.

=== Air ===
Hubei&#x27;s main airport is Wuhan Tianhe International Airport. Yichang Sanxia Airport serves the Three Gorges region. There are also passenger airports in Xiangyang, Enshi, and Jingzhou (Shashi Airport, named after the city&#x27;s Shashi District).

== Tourism ==
The province&#x27;s best-known natural attraction (shared with the adjacent Chongqing municipality) is the scenic area of the Three Gorges of the Yangtze. Located in the far west of the province, the gorges can be conveniently visited by one of the numerous tourist boats (or regular passenger boats) that travel up the Yangtze from Yichang through the Three Gorges and into the neighboring Chongqing municipality.

The mountains of western Hubei, in particular in Shennongjia District, offer a welcome respite from Wuhan&#x27;s and Yichang&#x27;s summer heat, as well as skiing opportunities in winter. The tourist facilities in that area concentrate around Muyu in the southern part of Shennongjia, the gateway to Shennongjia National Nature Reserve (). Closer to the provincial capital, Wuhan, is the Mount Jiugong (&quot;Jiugongshan&quot;) national park, in Tongshan County near the border with Jiangxi.

A particular important site of both natural and cultural significance is Mount Wudang (&quot;Wudangshan&quot;) in the northwest of the province. Originally created early in the Ming dynasty, its building complex has been listed by UNESCO since 1994 as a World Heritage Site.

Other historic attractions in Hubei include:
*The old Jingzhou City

*The Xianling Mausoleum, built by the Ming dynasty Jiajing Emperor for his parents at their fief near Zhongxiang
*The Yellow Crane Tower in Wuhan
*The Hubei Provincial Museum in Wuhan, with extensive archaeological and cultural exhibits and performance presentations of ancient music and dance. This is one of the best places to learn about the ancient state of Chu, which flourished in the territory of present-day Hubei during the Eastern Zhou dynasty and developed its own unique culture, quite distinct from that of the Shang/Zhou civilization of northern China.

The province also has historical sites connected with China&#x27;s more recent history, such as the Wuchang Uprising Memorial in Wuhan, Project 131 site (a Cultural-Revolution-era underground military command center) in Xianning, and the National Mining Park () in Huangshi.

== Sports ==
Professional sports teams in Hubei include:

* Wuhan Three Towns F.C. plays in Chinese Super League, the highest level football league in China.

== Sister State/Twinning ==
Following a July 1979 State of Ohio Trade Mission to China, Hubei and Ohio formed a sister province-state relationship. The pairing was based on the fact that both Hubei and Ohio are located in national heartlands, are large industrial areas and transportation hubs, and have significant agricultural sectors.

In 2005, Hubei province signed a twinning agreement with Telemark county of Norway, and a &quot;Norway-Hubei Week&quot; was held in 2007.

<text>The Three Gorges () are three adjacent and sequential gorges along the middle reaches of the Yangtze River path, in the hinterland of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. With a subtropical monsoon climate, they are known for their scenery.

The Three Gorges—comprising the Qutang, followed by the Wu, and finally the Xiling gorges—span , beginning at Baidi City of Chongqing, in the west and ending at Nanjing Pass, at Yichang City, Hubei Province, in the east, between which are the Fengjie and Wu Mountains of Chongqing, as well as Badong, Zigui, and Yichang of Hubei Province.

== Course of the Yangtze River ==

After arriving at Yibin (), in Sichuan Province (), the Yangtze River () flows from Jiangjin (), of Chongqing Municipality (), to Yichang (), of Hubei Province (); and this section of the river is called &quot;Chuanjiang&quot; (), or &quot;the river of Sichuan&quot;. In the past, it was the only waterway that connected Sichuan and Guizhou to China&#x27;s eastern area. (The Wu River () flows past Guizhou and empties into the Yangtze River at Fuling (), of Chongqing Municipality). Downstream, the Chuanjiang passes the Wu Mountains—the second ladder of the Chinese mainland—which form the Qutang Gorge (), the Wu Gorge (), and the Xiling Gorge () along the Yangtze River, which is where this area gets its name.

== Three Gorges region ==

The Three Gorges span from the western, upriver, city of Fengjie, in Chongqing Municipality, to the east, downstream, city of Yichang, in Hubei province. The Three Gorges Reservoir Region is approximately in length, while the Three Gorges themselves occupy about within this region: this has attracted global attention to the Three Gorges Dam and changed the culture and environment of the region.

Although it is primarily famous for its scenery, the Three Gorges region is historically and culturally important in China. Many settlements and archaeological sites were submerged by the upstream reservoir of the Three Gorges Dam.

== The Three Gorges ==

== Geological evolution ==
Due to the lithological conditions of its different regions, the valleys of the Three Gorges are narrow in some areas and broad in others. Most narrow valleys occur in regions where there is limestone, which is relatively hard and resists erosion. However, water can flow along deep vertical fractures, eroding underneath. As the limestone bed is gradually undercut, parts of it fall into the river along vertical fractures, forming precipitous cliffs. When the river flows through areas of softer sandstone and shale, which have less resistance to erosion, the erosive effect is increased, carving wide valleys.

There are different theories on how the Three Gorges were formed, but geographers and geologists have generally reached a consensus, believing mountain folding in the east of Sichuan Province and the west of Hubei Province, including the Wu Mountains (), were the outcome of the Yanshanian movement () around 70 million years ago. The gorges run from southwest to northeast, then turn, and from west to east, with terrain lowering gradually from south to north. The western and eastern parts of the area, between the southern mountains and Bashan Mountain (), in the north, are comparatively lower; and in the past, the river flowed to the east through the region. As the crust of the locality continued to rise, the river&#x27;s erosion intensified, and the Three Gorges were carved.

== Scenic grandeur ==
The natural beauty of the Three Gorges along the Yangtze River has been appreciated for hundreds of years. In the Northern Wei () dynasty, Li Daoyuan () described them in his work, &quot;Commentary on the Water Classic&quot; ().

There are seamless mountains on both sides of the Three Gorges stretching more than 200 miles. The overlapping rocks make up layers of barriers that shield against sky and sunshine so that the sun can only be seen at noon and the moon will merely show at midnight. In summers, water rises to lofty mountains, making all boats floating along or against the river get blocked. Suppose an empire has an urgent decree to issue from Baidi, it will reach Jiangling at sunset of the day. The distance between them is about 373 miles, and neither a galloping horse nor a flight can run faster than a boat.
Yuan Shansong () of the Eastern Jin dynasty wrote a &quot;Record of Yichuan&#x27;s Landscape&quot;, which depicts the Three Gorges&#x27; grandeur. He wrote,

People were always warned literally or orally of the Gorges&#x27; swift currents, saying they are horrific, and no one praised the local landscape [as] beautiful. It&#x27;s [not] till I came to the site that I felt quite gleeful and started to understand seeing is believing. The overlapping cliffs, the elegant peaks and the grotesque structures, they all constitute the scenery far from expression. The lush, solemn woods stood erected in the cloudy air. I can raise up my head to appreciate what&#x27;s above, and look down to see reflections, and the more acquainted I get with this place, the better I feel. I spent two nights there, forgetting to return. I had never seen such a scene, nor had I any similar experience. So I am cheerful to see such a wonder, I feel mountains and waters all had spirits, and I am thrilled to encounter this bosom friend after seeking so long.
In his poem &quot;Setting out from Baidicheng&quot;, Li Bai () depicts this place, saying,

While monkeys keep howling at both sides of the river, the boat has swiftly passed thousands of mountains.
Between winter and spring, the shadows of rocks and woods are reflected in the green pool accompanied by white, swift currents. Cascades plunge and flow across cypresses increasing at extremely high peaks. Clean water, flourishing trees, lofty mountains and luxuriant grasses compose the landscape. When the sun starts to rise or frost falls in the morning, forests and streams are chilly and solemn, and one can often hear monkeys howling from peaks. Their cries sound sad and strange and last in the valleys for quite a while, because of that, local fishers think the Wu Gorge is the longest of the Three Gorges in the east of Sichuan province.

The Three Gorges have renowned scenic spots, such as the Kuimen (), located at the western entrance to the Three Gorges. The cliffs on both sides appear to some as having been cut by knives or axes. Among the Wu Mountains that are located at the northern and southern beaches of the Wu Gorge, one of the twelve peaks is known as Fairy Peak. According to folk tradition, it symbolizes a fairy who assisted Yu the Great in controlling the waters and guiding boatmen. The Xiling Gorge comprises a series of famous gorges, including Military Book and Sword Gorge, Yellow Cow Gorge, and Lantern&#x27;s Shadow Gorge.

== Hydroelectric projects at the Three Gorges ==

In 1919, after Sun Yat-sen had put forward the concept in the Plan for Industrial Development of his (), experts investigated damming the Three Gorges, but it was not until 1994 that the Three Gorges project officially started.

In 1944, the Nationalist government recruited John L. Savage, the Chief Engineer of the United States Bureau of Reclamation, who came to China and made a 10-day investigation of the Three Gorges. Afterwards, he wrote an enthusiastic report on the prospects of a dam. Construction was started on the first of the dams at Upper Tsing Yuan Tung, but was halted on August 15, 1947, because of the Chinese Civil War.

In February 1958, as the expanded meeting of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee was held at Nanning (), the Three Gorges Project () was discussed for the first time, and fierce disputes broke out. In the end, this project was delayed. Over the following three decades, people continued to discuss it. In the early 1980s, people mentioned it once again, but after repeated discussions and investigations, it was again postponed. On March 6, 1992, a feasibility report was presented at the 5th Session of the 7th National People&#x27;s Congress (NPC) for discussion and resolution. On April 3 of that year, the NPC voted on a resolution for the dam, and it was passed with an unusually low approval rate for the NPC with only 1767 of the 2633 members () voting to support the dam.

== Three Gorges Dam ==
The Three Gorges Dam was constructed at Sandouping (), Yichang () in Hubei Province (), in the middle of Xiling Gorge. On May 20, 2006, the reservoir dam was completed, and the water level quickly reached the initial level of above the downstream river. The project was completed by the end of 2008, with a ship lift completed in 2015.

Both the dam and the Three Gorges Reservoir has had a massive impact on the region&#x27;s ecology and people, involving the mass relocation of towns and villages. The higher water level has changed the scenery of the Three Gorges so that the river is wider and the mountains appear lower. However, the mountains still tower above the river, and the gorges continue to offer views of the surrounding cliffs.

The riverboat companies operating on the Three Gorges are experiencing an increase in demand for river cruises. The increased width and depth of the river permits larger ships through the gorges, and there has been a significant increase in river traffic of all kinds, including bulk cargo and container barges.

== Threatened cultural sites ==
*The &quot;Baiheliang () hydrographic mark&quot;—In 763, during the Guangde period of the Tang dynasty () emperor Daizong, people discovered about 165 paragraphs of an inscription with almost 30,000 characters. There are 18 carps () carved in the stone along with the inscription, and they were used as hydrographic markers to record water fluctuations during low-water periods, to forecast agricultural outcomes. According to an initial estimate, after the reservoir is filled by the Three Gorges Dam, parts of Baiheliang, with 20 years of records, would be submerged. In 2001, Ge Xiurun (), a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences () proposed to use an &quot;unstressed container&quot; to safeguard the original site underneath the water and to construct tunnels to connect it to the ground above so that visitors can have access. Eventually these proposals would lead to the Baiheliang Underwater Museum.
*Shibaozhai (), or the Precious Stone Fortress, is located in (), of Zhong County () of Chongqing Municipality. Built between 1796 and 1820, during the reign of Qing Emperor Jiaqing (), these buildings represent high-rise column-and-tie constructions of the south of China. When the Three Gorges project began, a dam was built around this fortress for its protection.
*The Zhang Fei Temple (), of Yun Yang County of Chongqing, constructed no later than the Song dynasty, stood on the south bank of the Yangtze River in the northern foothills of the Feng Fei Mountains. Being close to the Yangtze River it was flooded more than once. The present temple is that which was repaired during the reigns of emperors Tongzhi () and Guangxu () of the Qing dynasty. The area of the temple complex is . A large number of calligraphy and paintings, stone inscriptions and woodcarvings from the Tang and Song dynasties, such as the first and second odes on &quot;The Red Cliffs&quot; () by Su Shih (), have been saved. Since the temple&#x27;s elevation was between , and it would have been submerged when the Three Gorges reservoir reached , the Zhang Fei Temple was relocated in its entirety.

After the construction of the Three Gorges Dam was approved, archaeologists were allowed time and resources to carry out rescue work. However, after the dam was built and used to store water, a large number of cultural relics, including hanging coffins and stone inscriptions that cannot be protected, were covered by the reservoir.

<text>James Paul David Bunning (October 23, 1931 – May 26, 2017) was an American professional baseball pitcher and politician from Kentucky who served in both chambers of the United States Congress, a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1987 to 1999 and a member of the United States Senate from 1999 to 2011. He is the sole Major League Baseball athlete to have been elected to both the United States Senate and the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

Bunning pitched from 1955 to 1971 for the Detroit Tigers, Philadelphia Phillies, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Los Angeles Dodgers. When Bunning retired, he had the second-highest total career strikeouts in Major League history; he currently ranks 22nd. As a member of the Phillies, Bunning pitched the seventh perfect game in Major League Baseball history on June 21, 1964, the first game of a Father&#x27;s Day doubleheader at Shea Stadium, against the New York Mets. It was the first perfect game in the National League since 1880. Bunning was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in 1996 after election by the Hall&#x27;s Veterans Committee.

After retiring from baseball, Bunning returned to his native northern Kentucky and was elected to the Fort Thomas city council, then the Kentucky Senate, in which he served as minority leader. In 1983, Bunning was the Republican nominee for governor of Kentucky. In 1986, Bunning was elected to the United States House of Representatives from Kentucky&#x27;s 4th congressional district, and served in the House from 1987 to 1999. He was elected to the United States Senate from Kentucky in 1998 and served two terms as the Republican junior U.S. senator. In July 2009, he announced that he would not run for re-election in 2010. Bunning gave his farewell speech to the Senate on December 9, 2010, and was succeeded by fellow Republican Rand Paul on January 3, 2011.

==Education and family==
Bunning was born in Southgate, Kentucky, the son of Gladys (née Best) and Louis Aloysius Bunning. He graduated from St. Xavier High School in Cincinnati in 1949 and received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics from Xavier University in 1953. Like a large percentage of residents in the Northern Kentucky region, the Bunning family was Roman Catholic.

In 1952, Bunning married Mary Catherine Theis. They had five daughters and four sons. One of Bunning&#x27;s sons, David Bunning, is a federal judge for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, who presided over the Kim Davis case, &quot;Miller v. Davis&quot;. Jim and Mary Catherine also have 35 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren, as of 2013. One of those grandchildren is Patrick Towles, a former starting quarterback for the University of Kentucky football team.

==Professional baseball career==
After pitching for the Xavier Musketeers as a freshman, Bunning signed a professional contract with the Detroit Tigers, though he continued to attend classes at Xavier. Bunning played in Minor League Baseball from 1950 through 1954 and part of the 1955 season, when the Tigers club described him as having &quot;an excellent curve ball, a confusing delivery and a sneaky fast ball&quot;. His first game in the major leagues was on July 20, 1955, with the Detroit Tigers. He had his breakout season in 1957, when he led the American League in wins (20) and innings pitched (), and was the starting pitcher for the AL in the All-Star Game. Bunning pitched his first no-hitter on July 20, 1958, for the Tigers against the Boston Red Sox. On August 2, 1959, Bunning struck out three batters on nine pitches in the ninth inning of a 5–4 loss to the Boston Red Sox. Bunning became the fifth American League pitcher and the 10th pitcher in Major League history to accomplish an immaculate inning.

Bunning pitched for the Detroit Tigers through 1963. During the 1963 Winter Meetings, the Tigers traded Bunning and Gus Triandos to the Philadelphia Phillies for Don Demeter and Jack Hamilton. In his first season with the Phillies, Bunning entered play on June 21 with a 6–2 record on the season. He was opposed on the mound by Tracy Stallard in the first game of a doubleheader. Through the first four innings, Bunning totaled four strikeouts through 12 batters. In the fifth inning, Phillies second baseman Tony Taylor preserved the perfect game with his strong defensive play. A diving catch and a throw from the knees kept Mets catcher Jesse Gonder off the bases. Bunning also had a good day at the plate, hitting a double and driving in two runs in the sixth inning. By the end of the game, even the Mets fans were cheering Bunning&#x27;s effort; he had reached a three-ball count on only two batters, and retired shortstop Charley Smith on a pop-out, and pinch-hitters George Altman and John Stephenson on strikeouts, to complete the perfect game.

Bunning, who at the time had seven children, said that his game, pitched on Father&#x27;s Day (although Father&#x27;s Day did not officially become a holiday until 1972), could not have come at a more appropriate time. He remarked that his slider was his best pitch, just like the no-hitter I pitched for Detroit six years ago. Bunning posted the first regular-season perfect game since Charlie Robertson in 1922 (Don Larsen&#x27;s perfect game was in the 1956 World Series). The Phillies also won the second game of the doubleheader, 8–2, behind Rick Wise, who earned his first major league victory in his first start.

Bunning&#x27;s perfect game was the first thrown by a National League pitcher since 1880. It was also the first no-hitter by a Phillies pitcher since Johnny Lush no-hit the Brooklyn Superbas on May 1, 1906. He is one of only seven pitchers to have thrown both a perfect game and an additional no-hitter, the others being Randy Johnson, Sandy Koufax, Addie Joss, Cy Young, Mark Buehrle, and fellow Phillie Roy Halladay, whose additional no-hitter came in Game 1 of the 2010 National League Division Series. He is one of five players to have thrown a no-hitter in both leagues, the others being Young, Johnson, Nolan Ryan, and Hideo Nomo. Bunning was the first pitcher to pitch a no-hitter, win 100 games, and record 1,000 strikeouts in both leagues.

Bunning is remembered for his role in the pennant race of 1964, in which the Phillies held a commanding lead in the National League for most of the season, eventually losing the title to the St. Louis Cardinals. Manager Gene Mauch used Bunning and fellow hurler Chris Short heavily down the stretch, and the two became visibly fatigued as September wore on. With a -game lead as late as September 21, they lost 10 straight games to finish tied for second place.
Bunning pitched for Philadelphia through 1967, when the Phillies began to rebuild. The Phillies traded him to the Pittsburgh Pirates before the 1968 season for four players, including Woodie Fryman and Don Money. He pitched for Pittsburgh into the 1969 season, and finished the 1969 season with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Bunning then returned to the Phillies in 1970 and retired in 1971.

Bunning&#x27;s 2,855 career strikeouts put him in second place on the all-time list at the time of his retirement, behind only Walter Johnson. His mark was later surpassed by other pitchers, and he is currently 21st all-time. Despite year in and year out putting up excellent numbers, Bunning rarely led the league in any pitching categories. He never led the league in ERA; the only year he led the league in wins (20, in 1957, with the Detroit Tigers) was the only year he ever won 20 or more games; he did, however, lead the league in strikeouts three times (with 201 in 1959 and 1960, and 253 in 1967). He never won a Cy Young Award; the closest he would come was in 1967, his best year, when at age 35, he came in second behind Mike McCormick. He finished with a middling 17–15 record, but posted a career-best ERA (2.29), and led the league in shutouts (6), games started and innings pitched (40/302.1), and strikeouts (253). It was the only year in his career he earned any Cy Young Award votes. He did, however, win the NL Player of the Month Award in June 1964, the month of his perfect game (3–0, 2.20 ERA, 42 SO).

In 1984, Bunning was elected to the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame. In 1996 he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame via the Veterans Committee. In 2001, his uniform number, #14, was retired by the Phillies.

After retiring as a player, Bunning began managing in the minor leagues for the Phillies organization. He managed the Reading Phillies, Eugene Emeralds, Toledo Mud Hens, and Oklahoma City 89ers from 1972 through 1976.

From the mid-1960s until his retirement from baseball, Bunning was active in the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA), and played a major role in transforming the organization into one of the country&#x27;s most successful labor unions.

Though the MLBPA had been formed in the early 1950s as an attempt to improve pay, benefits, and working conditions for players, team owners were still largely able to impose their will on the players by acting in concert to limit salaries and refrain from offering first rate employee benefits and working conditions, such as suitable stadium locker rooms and a per diem allowance to pay for meals while traveling for away games. At the time, the starting salary was about $47,000 in current dollars ($6,000 in 1965), and the average salary was about $112,000 ($14,000 in 1965). As a result, many players had to work in the off season. The owners also offered a substandard pension plan which provided low payments to retirees, and for which most players were ineligible. Many spring training playing fields were unsafe, and lodging and dining facilities were often racially segregated.

Bunning became active with the MLBPA early in his career, including serving as the pension representative for the American League players and a member of the union&#x27;s executive board. In 1965, Bunning joined with Robin Roberts, a founder of the MLBPA, to hire a full-time executive director. They agreed on Marvin Miller, then an economist with the United Steelworkers. They convinced the players union to hire Miller, and he remained in the position until 1983. Under Miller&#x27;s direction, in 1968 the MLBPA negotiated its first collective bargaining agreement with the owners, which put the players on the path to improved salaries, benefits, and working conditions. By the time Bunning retired, the minimum salary and average salary for major league players had nearly doubled. By 2015, the minimum salary was over $500,000 and the average salary was over $4 million. Over time, the MLBPA also succeeded at eliminating the reserve clause and Major League Baseball&#x27;s exemption from antitrust laws. As a result, players were able to negotiate for the right to veto trades, as well as the right to declare free agency and offer their services to the highest bidder.

After retiring, Bunning represented players individually as a player agent. He eventually represented as many as 30 players at one time.

At the time of Bunning&#x27;s death, Tony Clark, then serving as MLBPA&#x27;s executive director, praised Bunning&#x27;s union activities: &quot;Recognizing the need to ensure that all players receive fair representation in their dealings with major league club owners, Jim, along with a number of his peers, helped pave the way for generations of players.&quot;

==Political career==
Bunning was raised in a household supportive of the Democratic Party. While attending Xavier University, he joined the Republican Party.

===Local and state positions===
First elected to office in 1977, Bunning served two years on the non-partisan city council of Fort Thomas, Kentucky, before running for and winning a seat in the Kentucky Senate as a Republican. He was elected minority leader by his Republican colleagues, a rare feat for a freshman legislator.

Bunning was the Republican candidate for Governor of Kentucky in 1983. He and his running mate Eugene P. Stuart lost in the general election to Democrat Martha Layne Collins.

===House of Representatives===
In 1986, Bunning won the Republican nomination in Kentucky&#x27;s 4th congressional district, based in Kentucky&#x27;s share of the Cincinnati metro area, after 10-term incumbent Republican Gene Snyder retired. He won easily in November and was reelected five more times without serious opposition in what was considered the most Republican district in Kentucky. After the Republicans gained control of the House in 1995, Bunning served as chairman of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social Security until 1999.

===First Senate term===
In 1998, Senate Minority Whip Wendell Ford decided to retire after 24 years in the Senate—at the time, the longest term in Kentucky history (a record later surpassed by Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell). Bunning won the Republican nomination for the seat, and faced fellow Congressman Scotty Baesler, a Democrat from the Lexington-based 6th District, in the general election. Bunning defeated Baesler by just over half a percentage point. The race was very close; Bunning only won by swamping Baesler in the 4th by a margin that Baesler couldn&#x27;t make up in the rest of the state (Baesler barely won the 6th).

Bunning was one of the Senate&#x27;s most conservative members, gaining high marks from several conservative interest groups. He was ranked by &quot;National Journal&quot; as the second-most conservative United States Senator in their March 2007 conservative/liberal rankings, after Sen. Jim DeMint (R-SC).

Among the bills that Bunning sponsored is the Bunning-Bereuter-Blumenauer Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2004.

===2004 Senate race===

Bunning was heavily favored for a second term in 2004 after his expected Democratic opponent, Governor Paul Patton, saw his career implode in a scandal over an extramarital affair. The Democrats chose Daniel Mongiardo, a relatively unknown physician and state senator from Hazard. Bunning had an estimated $4 million campaign war chest, while Mongiardo had only $600,000. However, due to a number of controversial incidents involving Bunning, the Democrats began increasing financial support to Mongiardo. Therein when it became apparent that Bunning&#x27;s bizarre behavior was costing him votes, the Democrats purchased additional television airtime on Mongiardo&#x27;s behalf.

During his reelection bid, controversy erupted when Bunning described Mongiardo as looking &quot;like one of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s sons.&quot; Public pressure compelled him to apologize. Bunning was also criticized for his use of a teleprompter during a televised debate with Mongiardo where Bunning participated via satellite link, refusing to appear in person. Bunning was further criticized for making an unsubstantiated claim that his wife had been attacked by Mongiardo&#x27;s supporters, and for calling Mongiardo &quot;limp wristed&quot;. Bunning&#x27;s mental health was also questioned during the campaign.

In October 2004 Bunning told reporters &quot;Let me explain something: I don&#x27;t watch the national news, and I don&#x27;t read the paper. I haven&#x27;t done that for the last six weeks. I watch Fox News to get my information.&quot;

Bunning won by just over one percentage point after the western portion of the state broke heavily for him. Mongiardo retained a narrow lead with as much as 80 percent of the vote counted. However, he could not overcome Bunning&#x27;s lead in the western portion of the state (which is in the Central Time Zone) as well as George W. Bush easily carrying the state.

===Second Senate term===

As was expected in light of Bunning&#x27;s previous career as a baseball player, he was very interested in Congress&#x27;s investigation of steroid use in baseball. Bunning was also outspoken on the issue of illegal immigration, taking the position that all illegal immigrants should be deported. Bunning was also the only member of the United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs to have opposed Ben Bernanke for Chief of the Federal Reserve. He said it was because he had doubts that Bernanke would be any different from Alan Greenspan.

In April 2006, &quot;Time&quot; magazine called him one of America&#x27;s Five Worst Senators. The magazine dubbed him &#x27;The Underperformer&#x27; for his &quot;lackluster performance&quot;, saying he &quot;shows little interest in policy unless it involves baseball&quot;, and criticized his hostility towards staff and fellow senators and his &quot;bizarre behavior&quot; during his 2004 campaign.

On December 6, 2006, only Bunning and Rick Santorum voted against the confirmation of Robert Gates as Secretary of Defense, with Bunning saying that &quot;Mr. Gates has repeatedly criticized our efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan without providing any viable solutions to the problems our troops currently face. We need a secretary of defense to think forward with solutions and not backward on history we cannot change.&quot;

Bunning reportedly blocked the move to restore public access to the records of past United States Presidents which had been removed under Executive Order 13233.

In January 2009, Bunning missed more than a week of the start of Congress. Bunning said by phone that he was fulfilling &quot;a family commitment six months ago to do certain things, and I&#x27;m doing them.&quot; Asked whether he would say where he was, Bunning replied: &quot;No, I&#x27;d rather not.&quot;

In February 2009, at the Hardin County Republican Party&#x27;s Lincoln Day Dinner, while discussing conservative judges, Bunning predicted that Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg would likely be dead from pancreatic cancer within nine months. Bunning later apologized if he had offended Ginsburg with his remarks and offered his thoughts and prayers to Ginsburg. In an NPR interview in July 2019, Ginsburg noted that he was dead, and she was &quot;very much alive&quot;. Ginsburg died only 14 months later.

Bunning was the only senator to miss the Senate&#x27;s historic Christmas Eve 2009 vote on the health care reform bill; he cited family commitments as his reason for missing the vote. The bill passed without any Republican votes, 60–39.

On February 25, 2010, Bunning objected to a proposal of unanimous consent for an extension of unemployment insurance, COBRA, and other federal programs, citing that this extension was not pay-as-you-go. He proposed an amendment which sought to find the funds to pay for the bill from the Stimulus Bill of 2009, and declared that he supported the unemployed, but that a bill such as this only adds to the growing deficit and that it should be paid for immediately.

Senator Bob Corker joined Bunning, while other senators worked to cease his objections until 11:48 p.m. EST. When Senator Jeff Merkley urged him to drop his objections to vote on a 30-day extension of benefits, Bunning responded &quot;tough shit.&quot; On March 2, Bunning finally agreed to end his objection to the bill in exchange for a vote on his amendment to pay for the package. It failed 53–43 on a procedural vote. The extension of unemployment benefits then passed by a vote of 78–19.

===Aborted 2010 re-election campaign===

In January 2009, when asked whether Bunning was the best candidate to run or whether there were better GOP candidates for Bunning&#x27;s Senate seat, National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman John Cornyn said: &quot;I don&#x27;t know. I think it&#x27;s really up to Senator Bunning.&quot; Bunning replied: &quot;Anybody can run for anything they choose. I am gearing up, and I look forward to the challenge of taking on whoever comes out of the Democrat primary in May of 2010.&quot; Kentucky State Senate President David L. Williams was reportedly considering running against Bunning in the primary. Bunning responded by threatening to sue the National Republican Senatorial Committee if they recruited a candidate to run against him in the primary. He also attacked NRSC Chairman John Cornyn:

As of the end of September 2008, Bunning had $175,000 in his campaign account. By comparison, all other Republican senators facing competitive 2010 races had at least $850,000 at that point. In the last quarter of 2008, the senator&#x27;s campaign committee Citizens for Bunning had raised $27,000 from 26 separate contributions, ending the year with $150,000 in cash. In mid-April, KYWORDSMITH.com reported that of the $263,000 that Bunning collected during the first quarter of 2009, over 77% ($203,383) was received from out of state, while over 10% ($28,100) was actually untouchable for another 13 months as it was contributed exclusively for use in a general election. Bunning had two fund raisers scheduled in the first half of April.

In an April 2009 poll, Bunning&#x27;s approval rating was just 28%, and he trailed the four most likely Democratic candidates in hypothetical contests. 54% of voters in the state disapproved of Bunning&#x27;s performance. Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson announced on April 30, 2009, that he would form an exploratory committee to run for Bunning&#x27;s seat. It was speculated that this was a precursor to Bunning&#x27;s retirement. &quot;He (Bunning) told Trey to do this&quot;, one senior congressional official said of Bunning. &quot;Why else would he tell his main rival to prepare for a run?&quot; However, Bunning said at a Lincoln Day dinner in Kentucky on May 9 that he still planned to run: &quot;The battle is going to be long, but I am prepared to fight for my values.&quot;

In a press conference on May 19, Bunning called fellow Kentuckian Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell a &quot;control freak&quot;: &quot;If Mitch McConnell doesn&#x27;t endorse me, it could be the best thing that ever happened to me in Kentucky.&quot;

On July 27, 2009, Bunning announced he would not run for re-election in 2010, blaming fellow Republicans for doing &quot;everything in their power to dry up my fundraising.&quot; On April 14, 2010, in a further show of disdain for GOP leadership and insiders, Bunning announced his support for outsider candidate Rand Paul over establishment favorite Trey Grayson.

==Jim Bunning Foundation==
On December 18, 2008, the &quot;Lexington Herald Leader&quot; reported that Sen. Bunning&#x27;s non-profit foundation, the Jim Bunning Foundation, has given less than 25 percent of its proceeds to charity. The charity has taken in $504,000 since 1996, according to Senate and tax records; during that period, Senator Bunning was paid $180,000 in salary by the foundation while working a reported one hour per week. Bunning Foundation board members include his wife Mary, and Cincinnati tire dealer Bob Sumerel. In 2008, records indicate that Bunning attended 10 baseball shows around the country and signed autographs, generating $61,631 in income for the charity.

==Death and burial==
Bunning died at St. Elizabeth Hospice in Edgewood, Kentucky on May 26, 2017, aged 85, following a stroke he suffered in October 2016. Following a funeral service at Cathedral Basilica of the Assumption in Covington, Kentucky, Bunning was interred at St. Stephen Cemetery in Campbell County, Kentucky.

<text>A red brick university (or redbrick university) was originally one of the nine civic universities founded in the major industrial cities of England in the 19th century. 

However, with the 1960s proliferation of plate glass universities and the reclassification of polytechnics in the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 as post-1992 universities, all British universities founded in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in major cities are now sometimes referred to as &quot;red brick&quot;. 

Six of the original redbrick institutions, or their predecessor institutes, gained university status before World War I and were initially established as civic science or engineering colleges. Eight of the nine original institutions are members of the Russell Group.

==Origins of the term and use==
The term &quot;red brick&quot; or &quot;redbrick&quot; was coined by Edgar Allison Peers, a professor of Spanish at the University of Liverpool, to describe the civic universities, while using the pseudonym &quot;Bruce Truscot&quot; in his 1943 book &quot;Redbrick University&quot;. Although Peers used &quot;red brick&quot; in the title of the original book, he used &quot;redbrick&quot; adjectivally in the text and in the title of the 1945 sequel. He is said to have later regretted his use of &quot;red brick&quot; in the title. The term red brick for this category of universities is used as a contrast to the older more established universities that were all stone masonry constructions. The use of bricks was seen as a cheaper and less traditional alternative and therefore not as highly regarded, reflected in the general view of these new universities compared to the established ones.

Peers&#x27;s reference was inspired by the fact that the Victoria Building at the University of Liverpool (designed by Alfred Waterhouse and completed in 1892 as the main building for University College, Liverpool) is built from a distinctive red pressed brick, with terracotta decorative dressings. On this basis the University of Liverpool claims to be the original &quot;red brick&quot; institution, although the titular, fictional &quot;Redbrick University&quot; was a cipher for all the civic universities of the day.

While the University of Liverpool was an inspiration for the &quot;red brick&quot; university alluded to in Peers&#x27; book, receiving university status in 1903, the University of Birmingham was the first of the civic universities to gain independent university status in 1900 and the university has stated that the popularity of the term &quot;red brick&quot; owes much to its own Chancellor&#x27;s Court, constructed from Accrington red brick. The University of Birmingham grew from the Mason Science College (opened two years before University College Liverpool in 1880), an elaborate red brick and terracotta building in central Birmingham which was demolished in 1962.

== Civic university movement ==
These universities were distinguished by being non-collegiate institutions that admitted men without reference to religion or background and concentrated on imparting to their students &quot;real-world&quot; skills, often linked to engineering and medicine. In this sense they owed their structural heritage to the Humboldt University of Berlin, which emphasised practical knowledge over the academic sort. This distinguished the red brick universities from the ancient English universities of Oxford and Cambridge and from the newer (although still pre-Victorian) University of Durham, collegiate institutions which concentrated on divinity and the liberal arts, and imposed religious tests (e.g. assent to the Thirty-Nine Articles) on staff and students. Scotland&#x27;s ancient universities (St Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh) were founded on a different basis between 1400 and 1600.

The first wave of large civic &quot;red brick&quot; universities all gained official university status before the First World War: all of these institutions have origins dating back to older medical or engineering colleges, and were located in the industrial centres of the late Victorian and Edwardian eras that required strong scientific and technical workforces. These universities developed out of various 19th-century private research and education institutes in industrial cities known as university colleges, and presented their students for external examinations of the University of London or were part of the federal Victoria University. The 1824 Manchester Mechanics&#x27; Institute formed the basis of the Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST), and thus led towards the current University of Manchester formed in 2004. The University of Birmingham has origins dating back to the 1825 Birmingham Medical School. The University of Leeds also owes its foundations to a medical school: the 1831 Leeds School of Medicine. The University of Bristol began with the 1876 University College, Bristol, the University of Liverpool with a University College in 1881, and the University of Sheffield with a medical school in 1828, Firth College in 1879 and a technical school in 1884, which merged to form a university college in 1897. Of the redbricks that gained independent university status later, Newcastle owed its beginnings to a medical school established in 1834 and affiliated to Durham University from 1852, and a college of science established, in partnership with Durham, in 1871. Reading was established as an extension college by the University of Oxford in 1892, incorporating pre-existing schools of art and science, while Nottingham was established as a civic college in 1881 and students were awarded degrees by the University of London until it received its Royal Charter in 1948.

Combined English Universities was a university constituency in the UK Parliament created by the Representation of the People Act 1918 for graduates of Durham University and the six pre-World War One red bricks (Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, and Sheffield). Graduates of Oxford, Cambridge, and London had already been enfranchised and graduates of the University of Wales were enfranchised at the same time. Reading University was added to the Combined English Universities constituency in 1928 (prior to this its graduates, taking London degrees, would have joined the London constituency). The constituency was abolished in 1950.

==Other institutions==

Various other civic institutions with origins dating from the 19th and early to mid-20th centuries have also been described as &quot;red brick&quot;. According to historian William Whyte of the University of Oxford, Truscott&#x27;s original definition includes the University of Dundee (originally an independent university college, before becoming a constituent college of the University of St Andrews), Newcastle University (previously a college of the University of Durham, and noted by Truscot as &quot;perhaps&quot; being included), and the Welsh university colleges (not named, but could include Aberystwyth (1872), Cardiff (1883), Bangor (1885) and Swansea (1920)). Notably, Whyte does not include Reading or Nottingham, which Truscot lists in his second edition.

Many other institutions share similar characteristics to the original civic universities, namely those in the second wave of civic universities before the advent of the plate glass universities in 1961. These universities were similar to the red bricks in that they evolved from local university colleges and (with the exception of Keele) awarded external degrees of the University of London before being granted full university status; they differ in that they became universities later, after the Second World War (with the exception of Reading) rather than before the First World War. The Robbins Report lists University of Reading, University of Southampton, University of Hull, University of Exeter, University of Leicester and Keele University as being &quot;younger civic universities&quot;. Of these, the University of Reading, founded in the late 19th century as an extension college of the University of Oxford and the only university to receive its charter between the two world wars, describes itself as a &quot;red brick&quot; university.

Queen&#x27;s University Belfast gained university status in 1908 during the same period as the English red brick universities, having previously been established in 1845 as a college of the Queen&#x27;s University of Ireland (later Royal University of Ireland). As a result, it meets the dictionary definition of a red brick university, and is sometimes named as such.

Department for Education research in 2016 split universities into four categories: ancient (pre-1800), red brick (1800–1960), plate glass (1960-1992), and post-1992.

<doc id="83368" wikidata="Q15174" url="?curid=83368" title="Shenzhen">
<text>Shenzhen is a city in the province of Guangdong, China. A special economic zone, it is located on the east bank of the Pearl River estuary on the central coast of Guangdong, bordering Hong Kong to the south, Dongguan to the north, Huizhou to the northeast, and Macau to the southwest. With a population of 17.5 million in 2020, Shenzhen is the third most populous city by urban population in China after Shanghai and Beijing. The Port of Shenzhen is the world&#x27;s fourth busiest container port.

Shenzhen roughly follows the administrative boundaries of Bao&#x27;an County, which was established in imperial times. After the Opium Wars, the southern portion of Bao&#x27;an County was occupied by the British and became part of British Hong Kong, while the village of Shenzhen was next to the border. Shenzhen turned into a city in 1979. In the early 1980s, economic reforms introduced by Deng Xiaoping resulted in the city becoming the first special economic zone of China due to its close proximity to Hong Kong, attracting foreign direct investment and migrants searching for opportunities. In thirty years, the city&#x27;s economy and population boomed and has since emerged as a hub for technology, international trade, and finance.

Shenzhen is the home to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, one of the largest stock exchanges in the world by market capitalization and the Guangdong Free-Trade Zone. Shenzhen is ranked as an Alpha- (global first-tier) city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. Its nominal GDP has surpassed those of its neighboring cities of Guangzhou and Hong Kong and is now among those of the cities with the ten largest economies in the world. Shenzhen also has the eighth-most competitive and largest financial center in the world, the seventh-most Fortune Global 500 headquarters, fifth-highest number of billionaires, the second largest number of skyscrapers, the 19th largest scientific research output, and several higher education institutions, including Shenzhen University, Southern University of Science and Technology, and Shenzhen Technology University. Shenzhen railway station was the last stop on the mainland Chinese section of the Kowloon–Canton Railway.

The city is a leading global technology hub. In the media Shenzhen is sometimes called &quot;China&#x27;s Silicon Valley&quot;. The city&#x27;s entrepreneurial, innovative, and competitive-based culture has resulted in the city being home to numerous small manufacturers and software companies. Several of these firms have become large technology corporations, such as Huawei, Tencent, and DJI. As an important international city, Shenzhen hosts numerous national and international events every year, such as the 2011 Summer Universiade and the China Hi-Tech Fair.

A large portion of Shenzhen&#x27;s population are migrants from all over China, and the city&#x27;s population structure skews younger than most places in China.

== Toponymy ==
The earliest known recorded mention of the name &quot;chen&quot; could date from 1410, during the Ming dynasty. Locals call the drains in paddy fields &quot;Zhen&quot; (). Shenzhen was named after a deep () drain that was located within the area.&quot;

==History==
=== Prehistory to Ming era ===

The oldest evidence of humans in the area on which Shenzhen was established dates back during the mid-Neolithic period. Humans have inhabited the area throughout the past 6,700 years. Historic counties were first established in the area 1,700 years ago. The historic towns of Nantou and Dapeng, were built on the area that is now Shenzhen over 600 years ago. The Hakka people also have a history in Shenzhen since 300 years ago when they first immigrated.

In 214 BC, when Emperor Qin Shi Huang unified China under the Qin dynasty, the area was submitted to the jurisdiction of the established Nanhai Commandery, one of the three commanderies that were set up in Lingnan, and was assimilated into Zhongyuan culture. In 331 AD, the Eastern Jin administration split up Nanhai and established a new (东官郡). The seat of both the commandery and Bao&#x27;an County, one of its six counties, was located around the modern town of Nantou. In 590, the Sui administration merged the region back into Nanhai. In 757, the Tang administration renamed the county Dongguan, and moved its seat to what is now Dongguan city, although a military garrison remained.

During the 12th century, Nantou and the surrounding area became an important trade hub for salt and spices in the South China Sea. The area then became known for producing pearls during the 13th century. In the 1362 era, Chinese sailors of a fleet would go to a Mazu temple in Chiwan (in present-day Nanshan District) to pray as they go to Nanyang (Southeast Asia). The Battle of Tunmen, when the Ming won a naval battle against invading Portuguese, was fought south of Nantou.

=== Qing-era to 1940s ===
To prevent pirates from attacking Shenzhen, residents were resettled northward. As a result, Bao&#x27;an County lost two-thirds of its territory to the neighboring Dongguan and was incorporated into Dongguan in 1669. After the Qing state regime was defeated by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in the First Opium War and the Second Opium Wars, Hong Kong Island and the Kowloon Peninsula were ceded to the British. On 21 April 1898 the Qing government signed a &quot;Special Article for the Exhibition of Hong Kong&#x27;s Borders&quot; with the United Kingdom, and leased the New Territories from Xin&#x27;an to the United Kingdom for 99 years. Xin&#x27;an was briefly occupied by a British force under the command of Henry Arthur Blake, the governor of Hong Kong, for half a year in 1899. From the of territory that Xin&#x27;an held before the treaties, of the county was ceded to the British.
In response to the Wuchang Uprising in 1911, Xin&#x27;an residents rebelled against the local Qing administration and successfully overthrew them. In the same year the Chinese section of the Kowloon–Canton Railway (KCR) was opened to the public. The last stop on the Chinese side was Shenzhen railway station, helping the town&#x27;s economy and opened Shenzhen up to the world. In 1913, the Republic of China administration renamed Xin&#x27;an County back to Bao&#x27;an County to prevent confusion from another county of the same name in Henan Province.

During the Canton–Hong Kong strike in 1925, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions set up a reception station for strike workers in Hong Kong in Shenzhen. Strike workers were also given pickets and armored vehicles by the strike committee to create a blockade around Hong Kong. In 1931 Chen Jitang and his family established several casinos in Shenzhen, the largest of which being Shumchun Casino.

During World War II, the Japanese occupied Shenzhen and Nantou, forcing the Bao&#x27;an County government to relocate to the neighboring Dongguan County. In 1941, the Japanese army tried to cross into Hong Kong through the Lo Wu Bridge in Shenzhen, though this was detonated by the British, preventing the Japanese from entering Hong Kong.

=== 1950s to 1975 ===
In 1953, four years after the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the Bao&#x27;an County government decided to move to Shenzhen, since the town was closer to the KCR and had a larger economy than Nantou. From the 1950s to the end of the 1970s, Shenzhen and the rest of Bao&#x27;an County oversaw a huge influx of refugees trying to escape to Hong Kong from the upheavals that were occurring in mainland China, and a range from 100,000 to 560,000 refugees resided in the county.

In January 1978, a Central Inspection Team sent by the State Council investigated and established the issue of creating a foreign trade port in Bao&#x27;an County. In May, the investigation team wrote the &quot;Hong Kong and Macao Economic Investigation Report&quot; and proposed to turn Bao&#x27;an County and Zhuhai into commodity export bases. In August 1978, the Huiyang District Committee reported to the Provincial Committee on the &quot;Report on the Request for the Change of Bao&#x27;an County to Shenzhen&quot;. On 18 October, the Standing Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee decided to change Bao&#x27;an County into Bao&#x27;an City and to turn it into a medium-level prefecture-level city with a foreign trade base. The Huiyang District Committee and the Bao&#x27;an County Committee, however, defended the change to rename Bao&#x27;an County to Shenzhen, claiming that people in the world know more about Shenzhen and its port than they know about Bao&#x27;an County.

On 23 January 1979, the Guangdong provincial administration and the district of Huiyang announced their proposal to rename Bao&#x27;an County to Shenzhen and was approved and put into effect by the State Council on March 5 of that year. Also, the city would establish six districts: Luohu, Nantou, Songgang, Longhua, Longgang and Kuiyong. On 31 January 1979, the Central Committee of the Communist Party approved a plan to establish the Shekou Industrial Zone in Shenzhen with the purpose &quot;to lead domestic, overseas, and diversified operations, industrial and commercial integration, and trading&quot; based on the systems of that of Hong Kong and Macau. The Shekou Industrial Zone project was led by Hong Kong-based China Merchants Group under Yuan Geng&#x27;s leadership and was to become the first export processing industrial zone in mainland China.

At the beginning of April 1979, the Standing Committee of Guangdong Province discussed and proposed to the Central Committee to set up a &quot;trade cooperation zone&quot; in Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Shantou. In the same month, the Central Working Conference decided on the &quot;Regulations on Vigorously Developing Foreign Trade to Increase Foreign Exchange Income&quot; and agreed to pilot the first special economic zones (SEZ) in Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, and Xiamen. In November, Shenzhen was elevated to the status of prefecture-level city at the regional level by the Guangdong provincial administration. Hundreds of small villages nearby, such as Yumin Cun, were incorporated into Shenzhen.

=== Special Economic Zone (1980s–present) ===

In 1980, Shenzhen had a population of 30,000. In May 1980 the Central Committee designated Shenzhen as the first SEZ in China, which was promoted by then-paramount leader Deng Xiaoping as part of China&#x27;s reform and opening-up. Its objective is to be an experimental ground for the practice of market capitalism within a community guided by the ideals of socialism with Chinese characteristics. On 26 August, the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress (NPC) approved the &quot;Regulations of the Guangdong Special Economic Zone.&quot;

In March 1981 Shenzhen was promoted to a sub-provincial division. There were plans for Shenzhen to develop its currency, but the plans were shelved due to the risk and the disagreement that a country should not be operating with two currencies. To enforce law and order in the city, the Shenzhen government erected barbed wire and checkpoints between the land borders of the main sections of the SEZ and the SEZ outskirts, as well as the rest of China, in 1983, which was known as the second line border. Much of Shenzhen&#x27;s urban development in the 1980s focused in the area around the old border crossing and the market town. Its urbanization was typical for the 1980s.

In December 1990, under the authority of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange was established to provide a platform for centralized securities trading. In February 1992, the Standing Committee of the NPC granted the government of Shenzhen the power to make local laws and regulations. In 1996 and early 1997, the Shenzhen Guesthouse Hotel in Shenzhen was home to the Provisional Legislative Council and Provisional Executive Council of Hong Kong in preparation for the handover of Hong Kong in 1997. By 2001, as a result of Shenzhen&#x27;s increasing economic prospects, increasing numbers of migrants from mainland China chose to go to Shenzhen and stay there instead of trying to illegally cross into Hong Kong. There were 9,000 captured border-crossers in 2000, while the same figure was 16,000 in 1991. Around the same time, Shenzhen hosted the second Senior Officials&#x27; Meeting of APEC China 2001 on 26 May 2001 in its southern manufacturing center and port. In May 2008, the State Council approved the Shenzhen SEZ to promote Shenzhen&#x27;s administrative management system, economic system, social field, independent innovation system and mechanism, system and mechanism for opening up and regional cooperation, and resource conservation and environmental friendliness.

On 1 July 2010 the State Council dissolved the &quot;second line,&quot; and expanded the Shenzhen SEZ to include all districts, a five-fold increase over its pre-expansion size. On 26 August 2010, on the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the Shenzhen SEZ, the State Council approved the &quot;Overall Development Plan for Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industry Cooperation Zone.&quot; In August 2011, the city hosted the 26th Universiade, an international multi-sport event organized for university athletes. In April 2015, the Shekou Industrial Zone and the Qianhai Zone were integrated within the newly established Guangdong Free-Trade Zone.

On 18 August 2019 the central government in Beijing unveiled reform plans covering economic, social, and political sectors of Shenzhen, labeling Shenzhen a pilot demonstration zone for socialism with Chinese characteristics.

== Geography ==

Shenzhen roughly follows the administrative boundaries of the historical Bao&#x27;an County. The southern portion of Bao&#x27;an County became part of British Hong Kong after the Opium Wars, while the village of Shenzhen was on the border. Shenzhen railway station was the last stop on the mainland Chinese section of the Kowloon–Canton Railway, and Shenzhen&#x27;s economy grew and it became a city by 1979.

Shenzhen is located within the Pearl River Delta, bordering Hong Kong to the south, Huizhou to the north and northeast, Dongguan to the north and northwest. Lingdingyang and Pearl River to the west and Mirs Bay to the east and roughly southeast of the provincial capital of Guangzhou. As of the end of 2017, the resident population of Shenzhen was 12,528,300, of which the registered population was 4,472,200, the actual administrative population was over 20 million. It makes up part of the Pearl River Delta built-up area with 44,738,513 inhabitants, spread over 9 municipalities (including Macau). The city is elongated measuring 81.4 kilometers from east to west while the shortest section from north to south is 10.8 kilometers.

Over 160 rivers or channels flow through Shenzhen. There are 24 reservoirs within the city limits with a total capacity of 525 million tonnes. Notable rivers in Shenzhen include the Shenzhen River,
Maozhou River and Longgang River.
=== Climate ===

Although Shenzhen is situated about a degree south of the Tropic of Cancer, due to the Siberian anticyclone it has a warm, monsoon-influenced, humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cwa&quot;) though it is fairly close to a Tropical one. Winters are mild and relatively dry, due in part to the influence of the South China Sea, and frost is very rare; it begins dry but becomes progressively more humid and overcast. However, fog is most frequent in winter and spring, with 106 days per year reporting some fog. Early spring is the cloudiest time of year, and rainfall begins to dramatically increase in April; the rainy season lasts until late September to early October. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 27 percent in March to 53 percent in October, the city receives 1,853 hours of bright sunshine annually.

The monsoon reaches its peak intensity in the summer months, when the city also experiences very humid and hot conditions. Despite this, extreme heat is rare, there are only 2.4 days of + temperatures. The region is prone to torrential rain as well, with 9.7 days that have or more of rain, and 2.2 days of at least . The latter portion of autumn is dry. The annual precipitation averages at around , some of which is delivered in typhoons that strike from the east during summer and early autumn. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on 11 February 1957 to on 10 July 1980.

== Politics ==
=== Structure ===

Like all governing institutions in mainland China, Shenzhen has a parallel party-government system, in which the CCP Committee Secretary, officially termed the Chinese Communist Party Shenzhen Municipal Committee Secretary, outranks the Mayor. The CCP committee acts as the top policy-formulation body, and is typically composed of 12 members (including the secretary).

Despite being a sub-provincial city, Shenzhen as a SEZ still wields a lot of autonomy from the central government. In addition to being promoted to a sub-provincial city, the National People&#x27;s Congress (NPC) in 1981 granted legislative powers to Shenzhen and other Special Economic Zones, giving the city the privilege to make its own laws and regulations. The Standing Committee of the NPC also granted Shenzhen voted and passed the &quot;Decision on Authorizing the Shenzhen Municipal People&#x27;s Congress and its Standing Committee and the Shenzhen Municipal People&#x27;s Government to respectively formulate laws and regulations for implementation in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone&quot; in order to give fully strengthen Shenzhen&#x27;s legislative powers without interference from the central government.

=== Corruption ===
There were several cases of high-ranking Shenzhen officials who were arrested on charges relating to corruption. In December 2002, the Shenzhen People&#x27;s Intermediate Court sentenced Zhao Yucun, former Commissioner of Shenzhen Customs, to life imprisonment for taking bribes of 9 million RMB. In November 2003, the Guangzhou People&#x27;s Intermediate Court charged former Shenzhen Deputy Mayor Wang Ju with bribery and abuse of power and sentenced him to 20 years in prison. In June 2005, the Shenzhen People&#x27;s Intermediate Court charged sentenced Luohu District Public Security Director An Huijun to 15 years in prison for accepting bribes. In May 2011, the Zhengzhou Intermediate Court sentenced former mayor Xu Zongheng to the death penalty with a two-year reprieve for accepting bribes up to US$5.4 million.

===Administrative divisions===

Shenzhen has direct jurisdiction over nine administrative &quot;Districts&quot; and one &quot;New District&quot;:


Shenzhen was originally Bao&#x27;an County. On 5 March 1979, the State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China dissolved the county and set up the city of Shenzhen in its place initially with six districts: Luohu (), Nantou (), Songgang (), Longhua (), Longgang (), and Kuiyong (), with the seat based in Luohu. In October 1981, Bao&#x27;an County was re-established, with its region now based outside Shenzhen. In June 1983, the districts were dissolved and re-established instead as five management areas (): Shekou (; south-west Shenzhen), Nantou (; west Shenzhen), Shangbu (; central Shenzhen), Luohu (; east-central Shenzhen), and Shatoujiao (; far-east Shenzhen). To enforce law and order in the city, the Shenzhen government erected a border known as the second line (), which consisted of barbed wire and checkpoints between the city and the rest of China. Initially, the border control was relatively strict, requiring non-Shenzhen citizens to obtain special permissions for entering. Over the years, border controls have gradually weakened, and permission requirement has been abandoned.

In January 1990, the city merged Shekou Management Area and Nantou Management Area to form the Nanshan District, renamed Shangbu Management Area to the Futian District, and merged Luohu Management Area and Shatoujiao Management Area to form the Luohu District. In December 1992, Bao&#x27;an County was dissolved again, with its area taken by Shenzhen and split into two new districts: Bao&#x27;an District and Longgang District, though economic privileges within special economics zones did not pertain to them as they were outside the second line border. At this point, Shenzhen has five districts: Luohu, Futian, Nanshan, Bao&#x27;an, and Longgang. In March 1998, Shenzhen&#x27;s government created the Yantian District from the eastern portions of the Luohu District (the original area of the Shatoujiao Management District), and within the second line border. Yantian, Luohu, Futian, and Nanshan together as the special economic districts within the second line border are referred to as &quot;guannei&quot; () while districts that are outside the second line and do not have special economic privileges such as Bao&#x27;an and Longgang are referred to as &quot;guanwai&quot; (). The Shenzhen government later established two new districts as part of the &quot;guanwai&quot;: Guangming New District in August 2007 and Pingshan New District in June 2009.

On 1 July 2010, the second line border was dissolved, and the Shenzhen SEZ was expanded to cover the entire city. Therefore, the four &quot;guanwai&quot; districts Bao&#x27;an District, Longgang District, Guangming New District, and Pingshan New District, would be given special economic privileges like the &quot;guannei&quot; districts. The area of the Shenzhen SEZ also increased from to . Since June 2015, the existing unused border structures have been demolished and are being transformed into urban greenspaces and parks. On 15 January 2018, the State Council approved the removal of the barbed wire fence set up to mark the boundary of the SEZ.

In early 2011, the provincial government of Guangdong approved the establishment of the Shenzhen-Shantou Special Cooperation Zone in the city and SEZ of Shantou, Guangdong that will last until 2040 with the purpose of economic development. The zone would be managed by Shenzhen and another Cantonese city, Shanwei. The zone is under the jurisdiction of Shenzhen instead of Shantou, with residents living there considered to be permanent residents of Shenzhen.

The Shenzhen government later established two new districts on 27 October 2011, Longhua New District and Dapeng New District. With approval of the State Council, Shenzhen re-organized Longhua New District as Longhua District and Pingshan New District as Pingshan District on 11 October 2016 and Guangming New District as Guangming District on 24 May 2018, therefore becoming their own jurisdictions.

On 26 August 2010, the State Council approved the &quot;Overall Development Plan for Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industry Cooperation Zone&quot; to solidify ties between Hong Kong and Shenzhen.

=== Tourism ===

Tourism is gradually growing as an important industry for Shenzhen. Shenzhen has been ranked second on the list of &#x27;top 10 cities to visit in 2019&#x27; by Lonely Planet. The Shenzhen administration in its &quot;12th Five-Year Plan for Tourism Development of Shenzhen&quot; had focused on turning the city into an international tourist hub, with emphasis on the city&#x27;s scientific, fashion, and industrial elements. The Shenzhen tourist industry is claimed by the local administration in having a strong development advantage, due to the city being one of the tier-one cities in China, as well as being known for its coastal resources, climate environment, capitalist economy, and technological innovation.

In 2015 the tourism industry&#x27;s total revenue was 124.48 billion RMB (US$17.6 billion), a 98.1 percent increase from 2010. Out of the total revenue, 28 percent (35 billion RMB &quot;or&quot; US$4.968 billion) came from international tourists, an increase of 56.2 percent from 2010. In addition, in that year, Shenzhen received 11.63 million tourists, a 51 percent increase from 2010.
Shenzhen has numerous tourist destinations, ranging from recreational areas such as theme parks and public parks to tall buildings.

Shenzhen&#x27;s tourism industry is recently expanding under the &quot;13th Five-Year Plan for Tourism Development of Shenzhen&quot; as promoted under the Shenzhen local government. In this plan, the tourist industry plans to exceed 200 billion RMB and receive 150 million domestic and foreign tourists by 2020. In 2023 an increasing numbers of Hong Kong residents began visiting Shenzhen during weekends, which in turn caused Hong Kong service establishments to face a decline in business.

=== Retail ===
Retail is an important pillar of Shenzhen&#x27;s tertiary sector. Out of the added value of Shenzhen&#x27;s tertiary sector of 1.42 trillion RMB (US$201 billion) in 2018, retail contributed 43% (616.89 billion RMB) of this amount, a 7.6 percent increase compared to last year (601.62 billion RMB). In addition, 10.9% of Shenzhen&#x27;s FDI is directed towards the wholesale and retail sector.

Huaqiang North () is one of Shenzhen&#x27;s notable retail areas, being known for having one of the largest electronics markets in the world.

In addition, the Shenzhen administration is setting up a new retail industry development fund to promote the use of &quot;smart retail&quot;, with the intention of stimulating the economy of Shenzhen and to turn the city into a &quot;new retail&quot; hub.

== Demographics ==

As of 2020, Shenzhen had a total permanent population of 17,560,000, with 5,874,000 (33.4 percent) of them hukou holders (registered locally). As Shenzhen is a young city, senior citizens above 60 years old took up only 5.36 percent of the city&#x27;s total population. Despite this, the life expectancy in Shenzhen is 81.25 in 2018, ranking among the top twenty cities in China. The male to female ratio in Shenzhen is 130 to 100, making the city having the highest sex disparity in comparison to other cities in Guangdong. Shenzhen also has a high birth rate compared to other Chinese cities with 21.7 babies for every 10,000 of its 13.44 million population in 2019. Based on the population of its total administrative area, Shenzhen is the fifth most populous city proper in China. Shenzhen is part of the Pearl River Delta Metropolitan Region (covering cities such as Guangzhou, Dongguan, Foshan, Zhongshan, Zhuhai, Huizhou, Hong Kong, and Macau), the world&#x27;s largest urban area according to the World Bank, which has a population of 78 million according to the 2020 census.

Before Shenzhen&#x27;s establishment as a SEZ in 1980, the area was composed mainly of Hakka and Cantonese people. When the SEZ was established, the city attracted migrants from all around Guangdong, including Hakka, Cantonese, and Teochew, as well as migrants from Southern and Central Chinese provinces such as Hunan, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Sichuan, and Henan. Most of these migrants live in urban villages called &quot;chengzhongcun&quot; () such as Baishizhou in the Nanshan District. Shenzhen also has a notable Korean minority based in the Nanshan District and the Futian District originating from migrants moving to Shenzhen to work for South Korean companies that had branched out into the city when China had opened up.

Due to Shenzhen&#x27;s population overshooting the 14.8 million population target for 2016 to 2020, the Shenzhen justice bureau on 25 May 2021 announced it would make it harder to earn a hukou to live in the city. In regards to the registered population (hukou), Shenzhen experienced an increase of 2.178 million (58.9 percent) registered residents in the city from 2015 to 2020. The city&#x27;s permanent population increased by 7,136,088 (68.46 percent) from 2010 to 2020, for an average annual growth rate of 5.35%.

=== Religion ===
According to the Department of Religious Affairs of the Shenzhen Municipal People&#x27;s Government, the two main religions present in Shenzhen are Buddhism and Taoism. Every district also has Protestant and Catholic churches, as well as mosques. According to a 2010 survey held by the University of Southern California, approximately 37 percent of Shenzhen&#x27;s residents were practitioners of Chinese folk religions, 26 percent were Buddhist, 18 percent Taoist, 2 percent Christian, and 2 percent Muslim. 15 percent were unaffiliated to any religion. Most new migrants to Shenzhen rely upon the common spiritual heritage drawn from Chinese folk religion. Shenzhen also hosts the headquarters of the Holy Confucian Church, established in 2009.

=== Languages ===
Prior to the establishment of Special Economic Zone, the indigenous local communities could be divided into Cantonese and Hakka speakers, which were two cultural and linguistic sub-ethnic groups vernacular to Guangdong province. Two Cantonese varieties were spoken locally. One was a fairly standard version, known as standard Cantonese. The other, spoken by several villages south of Fuhua Road was called Weitou dialect. Two or three Hong Kong villages south of the Shenzhen River also speak this dialect. This is consistent with the area settled by people who accompanied the Southern Song court to the south in the late 13th century.

The influx of migrants from other parts of the country has drastically altered the city&#x27;s linguistic landscape, as Shenzhen has undergone a language shift towards Mandarin, which was both promoted by the Chinese Central Government as a national lingua franca and natively spoken by most of the out-of-province immigrants and their descendants. However, in recent years multilingualism has been on the rise as descendants of immigrants of out-of-province Mandarin native speakers have begun to assimilate into the local culture through friends, television and other media. Despite the ubiquity of Mandarin Chinese, according to the &quot;SCMP&quot;, some Shenzhen residents, Cantonese and non-Cantonese alike, have attempted to revive the Cantonese language as part of Shenzhen&#x27;s culture.

==Cityscape==


In 2019, Shenzhen has been dubbed by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;the world leader completing new skyscrapers.&quot; The city is ranked the second in the world in terms of the number of buildings above 150 meters, with 297 of them completed as of July 2021, after neighboring Hong Kong. There were more skyscrapers completed in Shenzhen in the year 2016 than in the whole of the US and Australia combined. The construction boom continues today with over 85 skyscrapers under construction across the city as of 2021, the most in the world. Most of the skyscrapers in Shenzhen were built by either Hong Kong or foreign-based architects, utilizing a modern style, though functionalism was a dominant form of architecture in the city&#x27;s skyscrapers in the late 20th century. Among the most prominent examples are the high Guomao Building, the high Shun Hing Square, the high KK100, the high China Resources Headquarters, and the high Ping An Finance Centre, which is also the second tallest in China and the fifth tallest building in the world. Built in 2015, the skyscraper is to be unique and elegant among its surroundings to represent the history and achievements of the main tenant: Ping An Insurance.
Shenzhen also has several historical buildings based in traditional Chinese architecture. There are Hakka walled villages located in the city such as Crane Lake and Gangeng in the Longgang District. Like typical Hakka walled villages, the architecture of Crane Lake and Gangeng are based around large thick grey walls, narrow alleyways, and courtyards. Nantou (or Xin&#x27;an) is a historic town located in the present-day Nanshan District and has some buildings that date back to the Ming dynasty such as the Guandi Temple, though most of these traditional buildings have been replaced by modern ones. Chiwan, located in the Nanshan District, also has several historical buildings, such as the tomb to the last emperor of the Southern Song, Zhao Bing and Tianhou Temple which was built by Zheng He as an offering to Mazu to protect the Ming treasure fleet. There are also several historical forts that had defended the coastline located within the city, such as Dapeng Fortress and Chiwan Left Fort.

In 2023, the Marisfrolg Pavilion, featuring an insect exoskeleton design, was completed and became a new landmark in Longhua District.

== Education and research ==

Before the 1980s, Shenzhen&#x27;s education system was based on primary and limited secondary schooling. No residents were admitted to a university. Since Shenzhen&#x27;s establishment as a SEZ in the 1980s, migrants poured into the city, and jobs requiring a university education grew. 

In the mid-1980s, as upper secondary education became popular, there was a need for higher education institutions in the city. Opened in 1983, Shenzhen Normal School, later upgraded to Shenzhen Normal College, trained students to become primary school teachers. Approved by the State Council in the same year, Shenzhen University became Shenzhen&#x27;s first comprehensive full-time higher educational institution. In 1999, the Shenzhen Municipal Government set up the Shenzhen Virtual University Park in the Science and Technology Park, where teachers from China&#x27;s top universities taught graduate students. In 2011, the Southern University of Science and Technology was established followed in 2018 by the Shenzhen Technology University. Other universities have established campuses in the city, including Tsinghua University, Peking University, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the Harbin Institute of Technology, and Moscow State University.

As of 2023, Shenzhen also has the 19th largest scientific research output of any city in the world.

Quality primary education in Shenzhen depends on parent&#x27;s ability to get their kids hukou. In Shenzhen, this depends on the birth, education and marriage of the parents. In 2020, 33% of Shenzhen residents had hukou. The nine-year compulsory education in Shenzhen is free. For secondary education, parents try to get their children into &quot;Shenzhen&#x27;s four famous schools&quot;: Shenzhen Middle School, Shenzhen Experimental School, Shenzhen Foreign Languages School, and Shenzhen High School. These schools have an approximately 10% admission rate for hukou students and 2% for students applying without hukou.

As of 2015, Shenzhen has 12 higher educational institutions, 335 general secondary schools, 334 primary schools, and 1,489 preschools. According to Laurie Chen of the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot;, Shenzhen, which had 15 million people as of 2019, had not built as many primary and secondary schools for its populace as it should have, compared to similarly developed cities in China. Laurie Chen cited the acceptance rate of Shenzhen secondary schools in 2018: 35,000 slots were available for almost 80,000 applicants. She also cited how Guangzhou had 961 primary schools while Shenzhen had only 344 primary schools, as well as how Guangzhou&#x27;s count of primary school teachers exceeded that of Shenzhen&#x27;s by 17,000; Chen argued that Guangzhou and Shenzhen have similar populations. In response Shenzhen schools began increasing salaries for prospective teachers.

Police has also cracked down on prostitution and pornography, which were elements of nightlife entertainment in Shenzhen, with one of the most prominent operations being centered in Shazui () in the Futian District in the mid-2000s, resulting in closures of entertainment businesses and a decrease of foreign tourists in that area of the city.

=== Parks and beaches ===
Shenzhen has an extensive three-level public park system that was established in 2006, which categorizes parks as natural parks, urban parks, and community parks. By 2019, the city had 1,090 parks covering about 39,320 hectares, including 33 natural parks, 152 urban parks and 905 community parks. According to state-owned news outlet Xinhua, Shenzhen plans to build and renovate over 40 parks per year, bringing the number of parks in the city to 1,500 by 2035. Lianhuashan Park is located on the territory of 150 hectares in the Futian District. At the top of its Lotus Hill is a six-metre bronze statue of Deng Xiaoping. Wutongshan National Park is spread around the mountain of the same name in the Luohu District. From the observation deck, there is a view of the Shenzhen skyline as well as Hong Kong and the surrounding bay, and on the next peak there is a transmission tower of a local television station.

Shenzhen Bay Park, located along the city&#x27;s coastline along Shenzhen Bay, opened in 2011, which included the nearby Mangrove Park. There are several thematic recreation areas and attractions, and along the 9-kilometer-long coastal strip there is an embankment. The Mangrove Ecopark was established in 2000 in the Futian District and at that time was the smallest national park in China. A large group of birds migrate to the ecopark in the mangroves on an area of 20.6 hectares in a 9-kilometer coastal zone of the Shenzhen Bay.

=== Pollution ===
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Shenzhen achieved an average air quality index (AQI) score of 44.8 μg/m3 and daily AQI score of 19 μg/m3. Out of ten Chinese mega-cities, Shenzhen recorded the lowest in average PM2.5 concentration (22.5 μg/m3), average PM10 concentration (37.7 μg/m3), average carbon monoxide concentration (0.6 μg/m3), and average nitrogen dioxide concentration (21.9 μg/m3). Swiss environmental technology company IQAir attributed most of the pollution in Shenzhen to stem from the engineering industry, continued use of coal, and traffic.

In 2014, Shenzhen experienced severe water pollution in the city&#x27;s rivers and waterways, with 173 of the 310 rivers considered to be in &quot;critical&quot; condition and four rivers: the Maozhou, Guanlan, Longgang and Pingshan Rivers, to be the most polluted out of all rivers in the Pearl River Delta. The pollutants in the river consisted mainly of ammonia, phosphorus, and nitrogen. In response, the city conducted a campaign to restore the city&#x27;s rivers by building more water pipes and sewage treatment plants.

=== Environmental protection ===

From 2000 to 2014, Shenzhen spent 30 billion RMB to restore the city&#x27;s rivers from water pollution, which some were considered at the time to be the most polluted in the Pearl River Delta. The city had constructed 33 sewage treatment plants and laid almost of sewage pipes. By 2020, the city laid an additional of water pipelines and completed 13,793 pipeline renovation projects in urban villages and housing estates.

In 2009, Shenzhen was chosen as one of thirteen cities to pilot a national new-energy vehicle program. In 2017, Shenzhen offered 3.3 billion RMB in subsidies in electric buses and the construction of charging facilities. In mid-2018, the city made major headlines for being the first city to roll an all-electric public bus fleet. In the same year, more than half of the city&#x27;s taxi fleet are electric, with the goal to turn the fleet all-electric. By early 2019, Shenzhen rolled out an all-electric taxi fleet, with 99% of taxis now electric-powered.

In late 2019, Shenzhen launched a garbage classification program in which waste is to be sorted in four categories: recyclables, kitchen waste, hazardous waste, and other waste. Residents who follow the guidelines will be given cash while those who do not would be fined by the government.

== Relations with Hong Kong ==

The area encompassed by Shenzhen and Hong Kong formerly belonged to Bao&#x27;an County in imperial times. After the Qing defeat in the Second Opium War, the United Kingdom seized Hong Kong Island and was leased the New Territories, forming the modern-day boundaries between Hong Kong and Shenzhen (the successor to Bao&#x27;an). The two cities are separated by two bays: Shenzhen Bay and Mirs Bay, and a river: Sham Chun River. According to then-Executive Council member Leung Chun-ying, the two cities&#x27; close relationship can be due to the close distance between the two, similar economic systems, differences in wages and price levels, and that the two cities have different systems compared to other Chinese cities, with Hong Kong embracing the one country, two systems principle while Shenzhen is a SEZ.

From the establishment of Shenzhen as a SEZ in 1980 to 2007, Hong Kong has been Shenzhen&#x27;s largest trade partner, with exports to Hong Kong accounted for 46.6% of Shenzhen&#x27;s total exports. In 2015, the total import and export volume of Shenzhen Port to Hong Kong was 1.1 trillion RMB. Both cities had established the Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industries Cooperation Zone within the Nanshan District which is a free-trade zone that mirrors the economic policies of both cities and to bring Hong Kong closer to mainland China. Tencent estimated that by 2020, Qianhai is expected to create a total output value of 150 billion RMB, with an output of 10 billion RMB per square kilometer. As of 23 February 2021, Qianhai has a total of 11,325 firms from Hong Kong.

As of September 2016, there are nine crossing points on the boundary between Shenzhen and Hong Kong, among which six are land connections. From west to east these include the Shenzhen Bay Port, Futian Port, Huanggang Port, Man Kam To Port, Luohu Port and Shatoujiao Port. On either sides of each of these ports of entry are road and/or rail transportation.

<text>A special economic zone (SEZ) is an area in which the business and trade laws are different from the rest of the country. SEZs are located within a country&#x27;s national borders, and their aims include increasing trade balance, employment, increased investment, job creation and effective administration. To encourage businesses to set up in the zone, financial policies are introduced. These policies typically encompass investing, taxation, trading, quotas, customs and labour regulations. Additionally, companies may be offered tax holidays, where upon establishing themselves in a zone, they are granted a period of lower taxation.

The creation of special economic zones by the host country may be motivated by the desire to attract foreign direct investment (FDI). The benefits a company gains by being in a special economic zone may mean that it can produce and trade goods at a lower price, aimed at being globally competitive. In some countries, the zones have been criticized for being little more than labor camps, with workers denied fundamental labor rights.

==Definition==
The definition of an SEZ is determined individually by each country. According to the World Bank in 2008, the modern-day special economic zone typically includes a &quot;geographically limited area, usually physically secured (fenced-in); single management or administration; eligibility for benefits based upon physical location within the zone; separate customs area (duty-free benefits) and streamlined procedures.&quot;

==History==

The United States has long applied special economic rules to its outlying territories for the purpose of economic development. Section 936 corporate tax exemptions for Puerto Rico began with Operation Bootstrap in the 1940s and ended in 2006. The federal minimum wage for U.S. territories has in the past been lower than in the states, and as of 2024, American Samoa is still adjusting upward to the nation-wide minimum.

Modern SEZs appeared from the late-1950s in industrial countries. The first was in Shannon Airport in County Clare, Ireland. Some tax-free jurisdictions such as the Cayman Islands offer technology companies a way to keep their IP offshore in a Special Economic Zone (see Cayman Enterprise City).

From the 1970s onward, zones providing labour-intensive manufacturing have been established, starting in Latin America and East Asia. The first in China following the opening of China in 1979 by Deng Xiaoping was the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, which encouraged foreign investment and simultaneously accelerated industrialization in this region. These zones attracted investment from multinational corporations and allowed export-oriented Chinese businesses to respond quickly to demand in foreign markets. China continues to maintain Special Economic Zones and certain open coastal areas. Most of China&#x27;s SEZs are located in former treaty ports and therefore have symbolic significance in demonstrating a &quot;reversal of fortunes&quot; in China&#x27;s dealings with foreigners since the century of humiliation. Researcher Zongyuan Zoe Liu writes that &quot;[t]he success of these cities as &#x27;red&#x27; treaty ports represented another step in China&#x27;s overall reform and opening-up plan while legitimizing the leadership of the CPC over the Chinese state and people.&quot;

Numerous African countries have set up SEZs in connection with China, including over the period 1990 to 2018 establishing SEZs in Nigeria (two), Zambia, Djibouti, Kenya, Mauritius, Mauritania, Egypt, and Algeria. Generally, the Chinese government takes a hands-off approach, leaving it to Chinese enterprises to work to establish such zones (although it does provide support in the form of grants, loans, and subsidies, including support via the China Africa Development Fund). The Forum on China-Africa Cooperation promotes these SEZs heavily.

As of at least 2024, there is a trend of southeast Asian countries to develop and increase their SEZs. Since 2015, Thailand developed ten SEZs. As of 2024, Indonesia has 13 SEZs, the Philippines has 12 SEZs, and Cambodia has 31 SEZs.

== Economic impacts ==

Special Economic Zones (SEZs) have a significant impact on the economies where they are established, offering several key benefits that contribute to economic growth and development. One of the most important effects is the attraction of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). By offering tax breaks, streamlined regulations, and enhanced infrastructure, SEZs provide a favorable environment for foreign companies looking to invest. This influx of capital can generate substantial economic activity, including job creation within the zones and in related sectors such as logistics, transportation, and services.

SEZ’s can lead to growth in Gross Regional Product (GRP) per capita, reflecting an increase in the economic output of the region. Similarly, they can contribute to higher personal income levels and attract more FDI projects, which bring in both capital and expertise. These economic improvements can contribute to higher living standards for the local population.

In addition to attracting investment, SEZs are crucial for generating employment. The businesses that establish themselves in these zones require workers, leading to an increase in jobs for the local population. This can, in turn, result in higher income levels and better living standards for people in the surrounding areas. However, it is important to note that the positive economic effects of SEZs do not always translate into positive social impacts. For instance, despite the economic growth they bring, SEZs may not always lead to a significant reduction in unemployment rates, as some regions may experience a mismatch between job creation and local labor market needs.

SEZs also play a vital role in boosting exports. Many companies operating in these zones focus on manufacturing goods for international markets, helping to increase a country’s exports, which can improve the trade balance and generate foreign exchange earnings.

Furthermore, SEZs contribute to local economic development by stimulating demand for local goods and services. As businesses in the zones require input from local suppliers, this creates additional economic activity and encourages further investments in the region. 
Infrastructure development is another major benefit. The establishment of SEZs often leads to improvements in transportation networks, utilities, and communication systems, which can have positive effects beyond the zone itself, benefiting the wider economy. 
Additionally, SEZs can serve as hubs for technology transfer and innovation. Foreign companies often bring advanced technologies and expertise, which can help local firms improve their own operations and boost their competitiveness. This knowledge transfer is essential for skill development within the local workforce, enhancing their capabilities and preparing them for future economic challenges.

However, SEZs also have some drawbacks, such as a possible increase in inequalities between regions or the potential for inefficient resource diversification. Indeed, the economic benefits of SEZs are unevenly distributed. Critics argue that these zones often benefit large multinational corporations disproportionately while providing limited gains for local businesses and communities. In Poland, for example, SEZs have concentrated economic activity in select regions, creating significant disparities in development. Moreover, the focus on foreign investors can result in dependency on external capital, which may not always align with the host country’s long-term economic priorities. This is directly linked to the theory of a balanced economy, which claims that an economy can only grow if all sectors are financed simultaneously. In contrast, the unbalanced development theory argues that investing in certain sectors—or, in this context, specific regions—can lead to the development of other sectors.

Another drawback is the fact that tax incentives can disrupt the equilibrium between the state and companies. When companies make sufficient profits, they pay higher taxes, which allows the government to invest without raising taxes. However, if this is not the case, the government may need to increase taxes. In a tax incentive system, to maintain equilibrium, the revenue generated by the system must be high enough to prevent the state from having to raise taxes.

Another issue is the so-called &quot;race to the bottom&quot; among EU member states. The lack of harmonized tax policies enables countries to compete aggressively by offering increasingly generous incentives to attract investors. While this may benefit individual SEZs in the short term, it undermines collective EU goals of equitable economic development and cohesion. Furthermore, these tax breaks often fail to deliver proportional benefits, as many foreign firms bring their own labor force, limiting local job creation and exacerbating inequalities.

Finally, while SEZs are heralded for their ability to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), their broader economic implications often reveal significant shortcomings. One major concern is their role in facilitating tax evasion. By offering highly competitive tax rates and other financial incentives, SEZs sometimes create conditions where corporations exploit loopholes to minimize their tax liabilities. This practice undermines state revenues, limiting the ability of governments to invest in public services and infrastructure. For instance, Ireland&#x27;s Shannon SEZ, while successful in drawing foreign investment, has been criticized for perpetuating &quot;tax haven&quot; dynamics that weaken EU fiscal cohesion.

==SEZ location==
The location of an SEZ and the presence of good infrastructure can determine whether an SEZ will be productive or not. The incentive is to establish SEZs in decentralized areas to promote employment and economic activities. However, SEZs located near large cities tend to be more productive. This is especially true if the SEZs have access to efficient communication and transportation systems, such as proximity to a port or an airport.

Many zones are deliberately positioned near borders to facilitate cross-border trade by allowing businesses to leverage tariff advantages and access multiple markets efficiently. For instance, companies operating in border zones can easily source raw materials from neighboring countries or export finished goods to nearby markets.

Another important consideration is why firms choose SEZs inside or outside the EU. SEZs in the EU offer unparalleled access to the European market, political stability, and high production standards, which enhance the reputation of products. Additionally, the advanced infrastructure and strong emphasis on sustainability in EU SEZs attract firms focused on long-term investments. Conversely, SEZs in non-EU countries may appeal to businesses seeking lower labor costs, less stringent regulations, or tax incentives that might not comply with EU competition rules. For example, firms targeting high-growth emerging markets or wishing to bypass stricter EU regulations might opt for SEZs outside the EU. 

== SEZ regulation in Europe ==

It is worth noting that SEZs in Europe are often seen as “unlikely cases” because they operate under stricter regulations compared to other regions. Unlike zones in Asia or Africa, European SEZs must align with EU state aid rules and fair competition principles. This makes their model unique, as they prioritize high-value-added industries, green energy, and technology sectors over labor-intensive manufacturing. These characteristics underscore Europe’s commitment to sustainable and knowledge-driven economic growth. 

The regulatory framework governing SEZs in Europe operates at multiple levels, encompassing EU, national, and local jurisdictions.

At the EU level, the regulations emphasize compliance with overarching principles of state aid, competition, and customs policies. However, SEZs often challenge these principles through deviations justified by their economic benefits. For instance, Articles 107-109 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) explicitly prohibit state aid that distorts competition, unless such aid is deemed necessary for fostering regional development or addressing specific market failures. SEZs navigate these constraints by demonstrating their contributions to broader economic goals, such as reducing regional disparities or promoting innovation, thus aligning with permissible exemptions under EU law
Customs regulations are similarly governed by the EU. Policies like Regulation 524/2008 enable the establishment of tariff-free zones, aimed at facilitating trade and attracting investment. These zones must operate transparently and ensure non-discriminatory treatment to avoid unfair competition
Economic and social cohesion is central to the EU’s regulatory framework, requiring SEZs to align with the Union’s objective of equitable regional development. For example, the SEZ established in Italy’s Campania region explicitly targets underdeveloped areas, offering fiscal incentives and streamlined administrative processes to stimulate growth. Such initiatives are designed to comply with EU policies on regional cohesion while addressing localized economic challenges.

Taxation within SEZs, however, falls under the purview of national governments. The EU lacks the authority to harmonize tax systems across member states, resulting in significant variations in SEZ tax policies. For instance, some countries offer aggressive tax incentives to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), leading to a &quot;race to the bottom&quot; that exacerbates economic disparities between regions. National authorities independently design these fiscal policies, often prioritizing immediate investment inflows over long-term equitable development

SEZs justify their breaches of EU principles by emphasizing their potential to generate significant economic and social benefits. For instance, they argue that tax incentives and regulatory flexibility are critical for attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and creating jobs in economically lagging regions. These justifications often rely on data demonstrating positive spillover effects, such as increased regional productivity and enhanced infrastructure. Nevertheless, these arguments remain contentious, as critics highlight risks like tax evasion, resource misallocation, and exacerbation of regional inequalities

== SEZ practical cases ==

=== Poland – East-Europe develop country ===

In Poland, Special Economic Zones (SEZs) were established to attract foreign investment and promote economic development. The primary goal of creating SEZs in Poland was to reduce structural unemployment and boost the economy in the poorest regions of the country. The main fiscal instruments used to attract FDI include tax breaks on corporate, personal income, and real estate taxes. These tax incentives can be applied for a period of 10 to 15 years. The Polish government created 14 SEZs, with the first becoming operational in 1995. Its creation resulted in the establishment of 55,000 new jobs and a significant increase in FDI, particularly in the automotive sector, as it attracted major industry players like General Motors. These zones are characterized by several attractive features, including high-quality infrastructure, a skilled workforce, and various tax incentives such as tax exemptions on profits and property within specified limits.

As of the end of 2014, the SEZs employed approximately 250,000 workers, demonstrating a significant increase from previous years. The cumulative investment in these zones was estimated at $23.3 billion by 2012. The Polish SEZs are regarded as some of the most competitive in Central Europe, with consistent interest from investors, averaging around 100 new permits issued per year. This ongoing demand led the Polish government to extend the favorable regime associated with these zones for an additional six years. Each SEZ is managed by specific entities or agencies dedicated to their development (Structure and Management). Originally, the zones were set up for a period of twenty years, but this has since been extended to 2026. The Polish government has recognized the importance of these zones in maintaining a competitive edge in attracting investment.

The success of the Polish SEZs can be attributed to their strategic design and the incentives offered, which facilitate the establishment and operation of businesses, thereby contributing to regional economic growth and enhancing the overall investment climate in Poland.

SEZs in Poland are attractive to investors due to several factors:

* Quality Infrastructure: The zones are equipped with modern infrastructure that supports various industries, making them suitable locations for manufacturing and high-tech services.
* Skilled Workforce: There is a concentration of qualified workers in these areas, which is essential for businesses looking for specific expertise.
* Tax Incentives: Investors can benefit from significant tax exemptions, including exemptions on profits and property taxes within a certain limit. This financial incentive is a key factor in attracting both local and foreign companies.

=== Ireland – North-Europe developed country ===

Ireland is often cited as a success story in the use of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) to attract foreign investment and stimulate economic growth, with the Shannon Free Zone as a notable example. Established in 1959, this zone is recognized as the first modern industrial free zone, designed to attract international capital into manufacturing and services, addressing the structural changes in air transport at the time. The Shannon Free Zone offered attractive tax conditions, including an exemption from taxes on export profits for 25 years and a highly competitive corporate tax rate. This strategy aimed to reduce bureaucracy and create a business-friendly environment, thus facilitating the establishment of foreign businesses in Europe.

The development of the zone was accompanied by modern infrastructure and integrated services, which allowed for improved operational efficiency for businesses. Industrial relations, characterized by an informal and cooperative approach, further strengthened this favorable environment. By 1968, the Shannon Free Zone employed nearly 4,000 people and played a key role in Ireland&#x27;s exports, becoming a driver of economic growth. The Shannon Development agency continuously adjusted its strategy to ensure the competitiveness and sustainability of the zone, demonstrating its commitment to adapting to the needs of investors.

The Irish government also played a crucial role in the success of these zones, particularly through the Industrial Development Authority (IDA), which worked to position Ireland as an attractive destination for foreign investment. The Irish experience shows how targeted tax incentives, robust infrastructure, and a business-friendly environment can transform a country into a leading player in attracting foreign direct investment.

=== Italy – South-Europe with developed country ===

The case of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) in Italy is illustrated by the establishment of the SEZ in the Campania region, which marked the country&#x27;s first such initiative. This SEZ was introduced through Legislative Decree No 91 on June 20, 2017, and became operational in 2018. Its main objective is to foster economic growth in the region by offering fiscal and administrative advantages to businesses operating within its defined areas. The Campania SEZ spans 37 municipalities out of the 550 in the region, covering a total area of 5,154 hectares. These zones were selected based on their strategic location near ports and transport hubs, aiming to enhance accessibility to logistical and industrial networks. The design of the SEZ focuses on improving infrastructure, especially to facilitate the movement of goods through road, rail, sea, and air transport.

One of the main features of the Campania SEZ is the array of benefits it offers to companies. Businesses within these zones enjoy various incentives, including exemptions from specific regulations and streamlined procedures for obtaining permits related to environmental, construction, and port operations. Tax credits are available, with higher benefits for larger enterprises and those in areas affected by natural disasters.

The key advantages for companies investing in the SEZs in Southern Italy include:

* Fiscal and Administrative Benefits: Companies operating within SEZs can benefit from various tax incentives and simplified administrative procedures. This includes exemptions from certain regulations related to environmental, landscape, building, and port concession authorizations
* Customized Tax Credits: The extent of tax credit advantages varies by zone and depends on the size of the company, with small companies receiving a maximum of 20% tax credit, medium-sized companies 15%, and large companies 10%. Additional benefits are available for regions affected by natural disasters, such as the 2016 earthquake.
* Access to Strategic Infrastructure: The SEZs are often located in areas with good transport accessibility, which is crucial for logistics and distribution. This includes proximity to major ports, interports, and transport networks, facilitating easier movement of goods.
* Focus on Local Economic Development: The SEZs are designed to stimulate industrialization and economic growth in the region, making them attractive for companies looking to invest in areas with potential for growth and development.
* Investment in Infrastructure: The ongoing and planned infrastructural improvements in the region aim to enhance connectivity and accessibility to and from SEZs, further supporting business operations.

The SEZ&#x27;s effectiveness is linked to the region&#x27;s transport accessibility, which has been carefully analyzed. Campania boasts a well-developed multimodal transport network, offering good connections both nationally and locally. However, challenges such as congestion at key transport nodes and access to intermodal facilities have been identified, which could impact the operational efficiency of businesses in the zone.

The Campania SEZ plays a significant role in Italy’s broader economic strategy, as highlighted by its inclusion in the National Recovery and Resilience Plan. This plan aims to provide substantial financial resources to strengthen SEZs and improve regional economies. The goal is to revitalize areas that face economic challenges by boosting industrial development and attracting foreign investment. Despite its advantages, the SEZ faces challenges related to transport bottlenecks, particularly during peak periods. Measures to address these issues, such as improving transport infrastructure and enhancing the efficiency of logistics networks, are being considered by policymakers.

===Albania – Developing country in the Balkans=== 

The development of SEZs in Albania is particularly interesting for several reasons. For Albania, SEZs represent a key instrument to stimulate industrialization, reduce unemployment, and modernize infrastructure. Strategically located along important trade routes connecting Europe to the Balkans, Albania’s SEZs position the country as a gateway for businesses looking to access markets in both Western Europe and the Mediterranean. These zones are also a way to attract advanced technologies, diversify the economy, and strengthen regional partnerships. 

From the EU’s perspective, Albania’s SEZs are significant for fostering economic stability and growth in the Western Balkans, a region with strategic importance for European integration. Supporting the success of SEZs in Albania can help reduce regional disparities, promote political stability, and align Albania’s economic policies with EU standards key steps as the country pursues EU membership sins years now. Additionally, the SEZs offer European firms an opportunity to establish operations in a cost-competitive environment while maintaining proximity to the EU market. 

In Albania, the concept of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) is embodied by the &quot;Technological and Economic Development Areas&quot; (ZTSE), established under Law No. 54/2015. These zones aim to attract investments by creating favorable conditions for both local and foreign businesses. The ZTSE encompasses various economic activities, while excluding those that could harm the environment or national resources. They offer a distinct framework with specific fiscal and customs arrangements to promote industrial development and trade. 

Companies operating in these zones benefit from several incentives, such as a 50% deduction on profits for the first five years of activity and the ability to deduct 20% of annual capital expenditures over a three-year period from the start of operations. Goods of Albanian origin delivered to the area are treated as exports with a 0% VAT rate, and constructions within the area are exempt from property tax for five years. Additionally, employers can deduct 150% of wages and social security contributions paid to employees during their first year of activity, providing a significant incentive to reduce labor cost. 

The ZTSE are designed to offer flexibility in employment, allowing for atypical arrangements such as part-time or temporary contracts. This flexibility can enhance employment rates and boost the local economy. Among its development goals, the Albanian government is focusing on specific zones like Koplik and Spitale to stimulate regional economic activity and generate jobs. 

This economic incentive model seeks to create a favorable business environment, inspired by successful models elsewhere, such as the Shannon Free Zone in Ireland or the Special Economic Zones in Poland, which have demonstrated their effectiveness in attracting foreign investments and fostering local economic development. Ultimately, the ZTSE aim to leverage a combination of fiscal incentives, regulatory flexibility, and targeted development strategies to boost productivity and drive economic growth in Albania.

==Types==
The term special economic zone can include:
*Free-trade zones (FTZ)
*Export processing zones (EPZ)
*Free economic zones (FZ/ FEZ)
*Industrial parks / estates (IE)
*Free ports
*Bonded logistics parks (BLP)
*Urban enterprise zones

==Challenges==
SEZs do not differ from other facilities in industrializing economies. As with any technique administered used by a globalized economy there are oversights by actors that are not domestic. Transnational criminal organizations and terrorist groups have taken advantage of Special Economic Zones and their lack of regulations.

SEZs also pose significant governance challenges. The preferential treatment granted to businesses within these zones can lead to regulatory arbitrage, where companies exploit differences in laws to their advantage, often at the expense of environmental and labor standards. This has sparked concerns about externalities, such as increased pollution and strained public resources, that extend beyond the boundaries of the SEZs.

<doc id="83383" wikidata="Q626268" url="?curid=83383" title="Cybersex">
<text>Cybersex, also called Internet sex, computer sex, netsex, e-sex, cybering, is a virtual sex encounter in which two or more people have long distance sex via electronic video communication (webcams, VR headsets, etc.) and other electronics (such as teledildonics) connected to a computer network.

Cybersex can also mean sending each other sexually explicit messages without having sex, and simply describing a sexual experience (also known as &quot;sexting&quot;). Cybersex is a sub-type of technology-mediated sexual interactions. In one form, this is accomplished by the participants describing their actions and responding to their chat partners in a mostly written form designed to stimulate their own sexual feelings and fantasies. Cybersex often includes real life masturbation.
Environments in which cybersex takes place are not necessarily exclusively devoted to that subject, and participants in any Internet chat may suddenly receive a message of invitation. 

Non-marital, adult, consensual paid cybersex counts as illegal solicitation of prostitution and illegal prostitution in multiple US states. Non-consensual cybersex sometimes occurs in cybersex trafficking crimes. There also has been at least one rape conviction for purely virtual sexual encounters.

==Environments==
Cybersex is commonly performed in Internet chat rooms (such as IRC, talkers or web chats) and on instant messaging systems. It can also be performed using webcams, voice chat, or online games and/or virtual worlds like &quot;Second Life&quot; or &quot;VRChat&quot;. 

The exact definition of cybersex—specifically, whether real-life masturbation must be taking place for the online sex act to count as cybersex—is up for debate. It is also fairly frequent in online role-playing games, such as MUDs and MMORPGs, though community attitudes toward this activity vary greatly from game to game. Some online social games like &quot;Red Light Center&quot; are dedicated to cybersex and other adult behaviors. These online games are often called AMMORPGs.

Cybersex may also be accomplished through the use of avatars in a multiuser software environment. It is often called mudsex or netsex in MUDs. In TinyMUD variants, particularly MUCKs, the term TinySex (TS) is very common.

Though text-based cybersex has been in practice for decades, the increased popularity of webcams has raised the number of online partners using two-way video connections to &quot;expose&quot; themselves to each other online—giving the act of cybersex a more visual aspect. There are a number of popular, commercial webcam sites that allow people to openly masturbate on camera while others watch them. Using similar sites, couples can also perform on camera for the enjoyment of others.

In online worlds like &quot;Second Life&quot; and via webcam-focused chat services, however, Internet sex workers engage in cybersex in exchange for both virtual and real-life currency.

On various AI chat sites like character.ai, Chai, etc, some users have sex with the bots, as you can make one to fit your liking. Although c.ai has a NSFW filter, users make suggestive bots, and bypass the filter. AI chats are a way to roleplay with a bot instead of other people, and allow you to change responses at will.

==Advantages==
Cybersex provides various advantages:
* Cybersex allows real-life partners who are physically separated to continue to be sexually intimate. In geographically separated relationships, it can function to sustain the sexual dimension of a relationship in which the partners see each other only infrequently face to face. Also, it can allow partners to work out problems that they have in their sex life that they feel uncomfortable bringing up otherwise.
* Cybersex allows for sexual exploration. For example, it can enable participants to act out fantasies which they would not act out (or perhaps would not even be realistically possible) in real life through roleplaying due to physical or social limitations
* Cybersex is a relatively safe form of sexual exploration in comparison to face-to-face sexual interactions. Sexually transmitted infections, unwanted pregnancies and physical violence are no dangers in online contexts, which is an advantage especially for women.
* It takes less effort and fewer resources on the Internet than in real life to connect to a person like oneself or with whom a more meaningful relationship is possible.
Research reviews and surveys call for a balanced view of online sexual activities in general and cybersex in particular that acknowledges both advantages and disadvantages, positive and negative effects.

==Legality of consensual, paid cybersex==
===United States===
Several US states use very broad language in their criminal code for prostitution and prostitution related crimes. For example, the criminal code in multiple US states does not necessitate physical presence to be an element of prostitution. The role of physical presence in states with broad prostitution definitions has at times been debated in court.

====California====
California has one such broad law about prostitution, and the California supreme court ruled in &quot;Wooten v. Superior Court&quot; that physical contact is necessary for a prostitution conviction. However, this only protects long distance buyers of cybersex in that state and may not apply to all sellers of cybersex services.

Sellers of cybersex in California may still be convicted under existing prostitution laws. Court cases such as &quot;Pryor v. Municipal Court&quot; and &quot;People v. Hill&quot; determined that &quot;touching of genitals, buttocks, or the female breast&quot; is essential to a prostitution conviction. As a result, physical touching between two sellers of during a live cybersex service &quot;for the purpose of sexual arousal&quot;, and coupled with &quot;money or other considerations&quot;, may in fact qualify as prostitution.

====Wisconsin====
Buyers of cybersex services have more criminal liability under solicitation of prostitution laws than act-of-prostitution laws. For example, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled that illegal solicitation of prostitution can occur with a lack of physical contact. &quot;Wisconsin v. Kittilstad&quot; ruled that simply offering money to view people having in-person sex, even from a distance, counts as solicitation of prostitution.

Wisconsin also explicitly criminalizes offers or requests of non-marital sexual intercourse for anything of value. This allows for criminal prosecution of non-marital, paid cybersex acts where at least one party resides in Wisconsin and at least one party has physical sex as part of the cybersex act.

===Measures undertaken by cybersex sites to avoid criminal liability===
To reduce the potential of criminal liability in cybersex selling, VoyeurDorm.com, implemented a &quot;no sex on camera&quot; policy.

==Non-consensual cybersex==
===Cybersex trafficking===

Cybersex trafficking is the live streaming of coerced sexual acts and or rape. Victims are abducted, threatened, or deceived and transferred to &#x27;cybersex dens.&#x27; The dens can be in any location where the cybersex traffickers have a computer, tablet, or phone with internet connection. Perpetrators use social media networks, videoconferences, pornographic video sharing websites, dating pages, online chat rooms, apps, dark web sites, and other platforms. They use online payment systems and cryptocurrencies to hide their identities. Millions of reports of its occurrence are sent to authorities annually. &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; has stated that new laws and police procedures are needed to combat this type of cybercrime.

===Cyber-rape===
A man named Bjorn was the first person charged with rape-via-the-internet. This was because Bjorn blackmailed minors into performing sexual acts for him over a computer network, which would normally be prosecuted under other laws. He was charged by Swedish authorities and Swedish laws notably do not require physical penetration for a rape conviction.

==Criticism==
Cybersex often attracts ridicule because the partners frequently have little verifiable knowledge about each other. For many the primary point of cybersex is the plausible simulation of sexual activity, and this knowledge of the other is not always desired, but this is also criticized as the emptying out of embodied relations.

In the words of Carkeek and James:
Privacy concerns are a difficulty with cybersex, since participants may log or record the interaction without the other&#x27;s knowledge, and possibly disclose it to others or the public.

There is disagreement over whether cybersex is a form of infidelity. While it does not involve physical contact, critics claim that the powerful emotions involved can cause marital stress, especially when cybersex culminates in an Internet romance. In several known cases, Internet adultery became the grounds for which a couple divorced. Therapists report a growing number of patients addicted to this activity, a form of both Internet addiction and sexual addiction, with the standard problems associated with addictive behavior.

<text>Arlington National Cemetery is the largest cemetery in the United States National Cemetery System, one of two maintained by the United States Army. Over 400,000 people are buried in its 639 acres (259 ha) in Arlington County, Virginia.

Arlington National Cemetery was established on 13 May 1864, during the American Civil War after Arlington Estate, the land on which the cemetery was built, was confiscated by the U.S. federal government from the private ownership of Confederate States Army general Robert E. Lee&#x27;s family following a tax dispute over the property. The cemetery is managed by the U.S. Department of the Army. As of 2024, it conducts approximately 27 to 30 funerals each weekday and between six and eight services on Saturday.

In April 2014, Arlington National Cemetery Historic District, including Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington House, Memorial Drive, the Military Women&#x27;s Memorial, and Arlington Memorial Bridge, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==
===19th century===


In 1802, George Washington Parke Custis, the grandson of George Washington&#x27;s wife Martha through her first marriage, began building Arlington House at the present-day Arlington National Cemetery on land that he inherited from John Parke Custis, his natural father, following his death. Custis went to live at Mount Vernon where George Washington and Martha raised him as their own son. 

In 1804, Custis married Mary Lee Fitzhugh. They had four children, but only one, Mary Anna Randolph Custis, survived into adulthood. On 30 June 1831, she married future Confederate States Army general Robert E. Lee.

In 1818, Arlington House was completed. Custis initially intended the house to serve as a home and memorial to George Washington, his foster father, but Washington died on 14 December 1799. Custis&#x27; will granted a life inheritance of the house to his wife, allowing her to live at and run Arlington House for the rest of her life but prohibiting her from selling any portion of it. Following his wife&#x27;s death, Arlington House, then known as the Custis-Lee Mansion, was passed on to her eldest grandson, George Washington Custis Lee.

====American Civil War====

In April 1861, following the Confederate States Army bombing of Fort Sumter in the Battle of Fort Sumter and the Union Army&#x27;s subsequent surrender of the fort, the American Civil War was launched, and Virginia promptly seceded from the Union. On 15 April, realizing that Fort Sumter&#x27;s fall left the national capital of Washington, D.C. highly vulnerable to Confederate attack and occupation, President Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers from around the Union to help defend it. 

Five days after Lincoln&#x27;s call for 75,000 volunteers to defend the national capital, on 20 April, Robert E. Lee, embracing the cause of Virginia&#x27;s separation from the Union, resigned his U.S. Army commission to lead Virginia&#x27;s separatist armed forces; the following year, on 1 June 1862, Lee was appointed commander of the Army of Northern Virginia, the Confederate Army&#x27;s primary military force. 

When the Civil War commenced, American military personnel who died in battle near Washington, D.C., were buried at the United States Soldiers&#x27; Cemetery in Washington, D.C., or Alexandria Cemetery in Alexandria, Virginia. By late 1863, however, both cemeteries were nearly full.

On 3 May 1861, General Winfield Scott ordered Brigadier General Irvin McDowell to clear all troops not loyal to the Union from Arlington and neighboring Alexandria. On 7 May 1861, however, the Confederate-aligned Virginia militia captured Arlington and Arlington House. With Confederate forces occupying the high ground of Arlington, the neighboring national capital in Washington, D.C. was left vulnerable to Confederate Army attack. 

Despite not wanting to leave Arlington House, Mary Lee believed her estate would soon be recaptured by Union soldiers. On 14 May, she buried many of her family treasures on the grounds, and then left for her sister&#x27;s estate at Ravensworth in present-day Fairfax County, Virginia. Some of the personal property she buried included family portraits that were stolen by Union soldiers. McDowell occupied Arlington without opposition on 24 May.

On 16 July 1862, the U.S. Congress passed legislation authorizing the U.S. federal government to purchase land for national cemeteries for the purpose of burying military dead, and placed the U.S. Army Quartermaster General in charge of this program. 

Beginning in 1863, the federal government used the southern portion of the land now occupied by the cemetery as a settlement for freed slaves, giving the land the name &quot;Freedman&#x27;s Village&quot;. The government constructed rental houses that 1,100 to 3,000 freed slaves eventually occupied while farming of the estate and receiving schooling and occupational training, both during the Civil War and after its end.

In May 1864, the Union Army suffered large fatalities in the Battle of the Wilderness. Quartermaster General Montgomery C. Meigs ordered a review of eligible sites for the establishment of a large and new national military cemetery. Within weeks, his staff reported that Arlington Estate was the most suitable property in the area. The property was located at a relatively high elevation and was typically free from floods capable of unearthing graves, and it was aesthetically pleasing. An additional factor in its selection was likely that it was the residence of Robert E. Lee, a leader in the Confederate States Army, and denying Lee use of his home during and following the war was advantageous to the Union. 

On 13 May 1864, William Henry Christman was buried at Arlington Cemetery, close to what is now the northeast gate in Section 27, even though Meigs did not formally authorize establishment of burials until the following month, on 15 June 1864. Consistent with the practices of many cemeteries in the late 19th century, Arlington Cemetery maintained segregated burial practices. On 26 July 1948, however, U.S. president Harry S. Truman issued Executive Order 9981, which formally reversed this practice.

In 1864, with the Civil War still ongoing, the Union acquired Arlington Cemetery for $26,800, , after the property was placed for tax sale. Mrs. Lee did not appear in person for the tax sale, but sent an agent, who attempted to pay the $92.07 allegedly owed in property taxes, , which had been assessed on the estate. The Union government, however, turned her agent away, and refused to accept the tendered payment. The Washington Chronicle described the Freedmen&#x27;s Village at Arlington in an article published in September 1864 and recorded at that time, &quot;This cemetery is at present divided into the upper yard and the lower yard. The upper yard contains fourteen hundred graves, and the lower twelve hundred. These graves are marked with wooden slabs, with the exception of one marble slab in the upper and one in the lower yard. As we passed by it, a cortege of five ambulances, containing nine coffins, moved by. Some of the coffins were draped with our colors. The cemetery is as yet enclosed with a wooden fence.&quot;

In 1866, The Old Bell Church, led by Rev. Robert S. Laws, was founded. After Freedman&#x27;s Village became part of a military reservation, the government asked the villagers to leave. In 1887, however, some still remained, and John A. Commerford, the Superintendent of Arlington National Cemetery, asked the U.S. Army&#x27;s Quartermaster General to close the village on the grounds that people living in it had been taking trees at night from the cemetery for use as firewood. The Quartermaster General and the Secretary of War then approved Commerford&#x27;s request.

===&quot;U.S. v. Lee&quot;===

In 1874, George Washington Custis Lee sued the U.S. federal government, claiming ownership of the Arlington Cemetery grounds. On 9 December 1882, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5–4 in Lee&#x27;s favor in &quot;United States v. Lee&quot;, concluding that the U.S. government seized Arlington Cemetery and its surrounding grounds without affording Lee due process.

Following the U.S. Supreme Court decision, Congress abided by the Supreme Court ruling, and returned the estate to Lee. By this time, however, Lee was less interested in obtaining the property than in receiving cash compensation for it. On 3 March 1883, Custis Lee sold it back to the U.S. government for $150,000 () at a signing ceremony with then Secretary of War Robert Todd Lincoln. The land then became a U.S. military reservation.

===20th century===
In 1900, the last remaining residents of the village departed after the 56th United States Congress appropriated $75,000 () to settle the U.S. government&#x27;s debts to them. With limited space but large numbers of KIAs from World War II, Korean War, Vietnam War, along with natural deaths from high-ranking military officials, the need for additional burial space at Arlington Cemetery became a challenge and priority to the U.S. government. 

On 30 May 1929, U.S. President Herbert Hoover conducted the first national Memorial Day ceremony in Arlington National Cemetery.

In October 1991, John C. Metzler Jr., Arlington Cemetery&#x27;s superintendent, implemented a $1.4 million plan to clear a former parking lot to create additional space that would accommodate approximately 9,000 additional grave sites.

====Wreaths Across America====
In 1992, the Worcester Wreath company in Harrington, Maine, had a surplus at the end of the Christmas holiday season. Recalling a boyhood trip to Arlington National Cemetery, company founder Morrill Worcester donated 5,000 wreaths to the cemetery to honor the cemetery&#x27;s dead with the help of volunteers and a local trucking company. In 2005, after 13 years of similar donations, a photo of snowy gravestones covered with wreaths at the cemetery received widespread circulation on the internet. Thousands of people called Worcester Wreath Company, wanting to replicate the wreath-laying service at their own veteran cemeteries. In 2014, volunteers were able to place wreaths in all sections of the cemetery for the first time.

On 22 February 1995, officials of the U.S. Department of Interior and the U.S. Department of the Army signed an agreement to transfer from Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial, to the U.S. Army a part of Arlington Woods, which was located in Section 29 of the National Park Service at Arlington National Cemetery between Arlington House and Fort Myer. The property transfer, which involved of NPS land, was intended to permit Metzler to start expanding the cemetery beyond its existing boundaries.

In September 1996, Arlington Cemetery received the authority to transfer of woodland from the National Park Service-controlled Arlington House and 2001, of land in 1999 from the DoD that was the site of the Navy Annex building, of land in 1999 from the Department of the Army that was part of Fort Myer, of land from Arlington County&#x27;s Southgate Road right-of-way in 2004, and just under of land from Fort Myer in 2005.

On 23 September 1996, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 (Public Law 104–201) authorized the Secretary of the Interior to transfer to the Secretary of the Army all of the land in Section 29 that was within an &quot;Arlington National Cemetery Interment Zone&quot; and some of the land in the Section that was within a &quot;Robert E. Lee Memorial Preservation Zone&quot;.

On 5 March 1998, the National Park Service, a component of the Department of the Interior, informed the National Capital Planning Commission that it wanted to transfer only to the cemetery, rather than the that the 1995 agreement had described. In response, Metzler stated: &quot;I was surprised. But we will continue to work with the Department of Interior and see what happens.&quot;

On 12 July 1999, the National Park Service published a &quot;Federal Register&quot; notice, announcing the availability of an environmental assessment for the transfer. The EA stated that the Interment Zone contained the oldest and largest tract of climax eastern hardwood forest in Arlington County. This forest was the same type that once covered the Arlington estate, and had regenerated from trees that were present historically. A forestry study determined that a representative tree was 258 years old. The Interment Zone was also determined to contain significant archeological and cultural landscape resources, in addition to those in the Preservation Zone. The EA described four alternative courses of action.

In contrast to the National Park Service&#x27;s March 1998 statement to the National Capital Planning Commission, the 1999 environmental assessment stated that the preferred alternative (Alternative 1) would transfer to the cemetery approximately , comprising most of the Interment Zone and the northern tip of the Preservation Zone. Another alternative (Alternative 3) would transfer to the cemetery the Interment Zone, while keeping the Preservation Zone under NPS jurisdiction. The EA concluded: &quot;Public Law 104-201 directed the Secretary of the Interior to transfer to the Secretary of the Army jurisdiction over the Interment Zone, which is the plan in Alternative 3. Adoption of any of the other alternatives would require legislative action to amend the existing law.&quot;

In 1998, a Congressional proposal to expand the cemetery onto land that the Navy Annex and Fort Myer then occupied led to concerns that Arlington County officials had not been properly consulted, leading to the withdrawal of the proposal. However, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000 (Public Law 106–65), which was enacted into law during October 1999, subsequently required the Secretary of Defense to transfer administrative jurisdiction of the Navy Annex property to the Secretary of the Army. The Act required the Secretary of Defense to demolish the Annex&#x27;s buildings and prepare the property for use as part of the cemetery, while requiring the Secretary of the Army to incorporate the Annex property into the cemetery.

===21st century===

On 28 December 2001, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 (Public Law 107-107) repealed the &quot;obsolete&quot; part of Public Law 104-201 that had authorized the transfer of portions of Section 29 to the Secretary of the Army. The new legislation required the Secretary of the Interior to transfer to the Secretary of the Army within 30 days the approximately Interment Zone. The transfer therefore involved the entire of NPS land that the 1995 agreement and Alternative 3 in the 1999 EA had described.

The 2001 legislation required the Secretary of the Army to use the Interment Zone for in-ground burial sites and columbarium. In addition, the legislation required the Secretary of the Interior to manage the remainder of Section 29 &quot;in perpetuity to provide a natural setting and visual buffer for Arlington House, the Robert E. Lee Memorial.&quot;

In 2007, Metzler implemented the Millennium Project, a $35 million expansion plan to begin utilizing the Arlington woodland, Fort Myer, and Navy Annex land. The project also included converting of unused space and of maintenance property on the cemetery grounds into burial space in 2006 and 2007 to allow an additional 26,000 graves and 5,000 inurnments. The Millennium Project expanded the cemetery&#x27;s physical boundaries for the first time since the 1960s, and was the largest expansion of burial space at the site since the U.S. Civil War. Several environmental and historical preservation groups criticized Metzler&#x27;s plans, as did the NPS and the manager of Arlington House.

====2010 mismanagement controversy====

On 9 June 2010, United States Secretary of the Army John M. McHugh reprimanded the cemetery&#x27;s superintendent, John C. Metzler, Jr., and his deputy, Thurman Higgenbotham, after a DOD inspector general&#x27;s report revealed that cemetery officials had placed the wrong headstones on tombs, buried coffins in shallow graves, and buried bodies on top of one another. Metzler, who had already announced his intention to retire on 2 July 2010, admitted some mistakes had been made but denied allegations of widespread or serious mismanagement. The investigation also found that cemetery employees were burdened in their day-to-day work by &quot;dysfunctional management, lack of established policy and procedures, and an overall unhealthy organizational climate.&quot; Both Metzler and Higgenbotham retired soon after the investigation commenced.

In March 2011, as a result of the problems discovered, Kathryn Condon, the recently appointed executive director of the Army National Military Cemeteries, announced that the cemetery&#x27;s staff had been increased from 102 to 159. She added that the cemetery was also acquiring additional equipment because, &quot;They didn&#x27;t have the proper equipment to do the job really to the standard they needed to do.&quot;

The mismanagement controversy included a limitation on mass media access to funerals, which also proved controversial. Until 2005, the cemetery&#x27;s administration gave free access, with the family&#x27;s permission, to the press to cover funerals at the cemetery. In July 2008, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that cemetery had imposed gradually increasing restrictions on media coverage of funerals beginning three years earlier, in 2005.

After the cemetery&#x27;s management controversy began to end, the Army appointed Patrick K. Hallinan the acting superintendent of the cemetery in June 2010. He was promoted permanently to the position in October 2010. Hallinan had previously worked for the Office of Field Programs in the National Cemetery Administration, an agency of the United States Department of Veterans&#x27; Affairs. In that capacity, Hallinan had oversight of 131 national cemeteries, national cemetery policy, procedures, and operations. Hallinan was promoted to executive director of the Army National Military Cemeteries upon the retirement of Kathryn Condon in spring 2014.

In May 2014, Hallinan stepped down and was replaced by Jack E. Lechner, Jr. as superintendent of the cemetery. Lechner had been a funeral director for 10 years in the private sector before joining the U.S. Army. He rose to the rank of colonel, and retired in November 2011 after having spent 2008 to 2010 as chief of the Supply Division of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, overseeing the equipping security forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since 2010, he served as executive officer and deputy superintendent of the cemetery under Hallinan.

In September 2008, environmentalists expressed concerns that the agreement would result in the partial destruction of the remnant of a historically important stand of native trees. A historical marker near the woodland notes that, while visiting Arlington House in 1825, Marquis de Lafayette, the French volunteer to the Continental Army who ultimately became one of George Washington&#x27;s long-standing friends, warned Mary Lee Fitzhugh Custis, wife of George Washington Parke Custis, &quot;Cherish these forest trees around your mansion. Recollect how much easier it is to cut a tree than to make one grow.&quot; The marker notes that the Virginia Native Plant Society recognized the woodland as being one of the best examples of old growth terraced gravel forest remaining in Virginia.

On 12 December 2012, the United States Army Corps of Engineers asked for comments on a draft environmental assessment that described a further expansion of Arlington National Cemetery as part of the Millennium Project. 

The 2012 draft environmental assessment was intended to implement conversion into burial space of the of Fort Myer grounds and of Section 29 woodland. The draft described seven alternatives. The preferred alternative (Alternative E) called for the removal of about one-half of the 1,700 trees with a diameter of or greater on the site. About 640 of the trees were within a 135-year-old portion of Arlington Woods. The draft concluded, &quot;Based on the evaluation of environmental impacts..., no significant impacts would be expected from the Proposed Action; therefore, an Environmental Impact Statement will not be prepared and a Finding of No Significant Impact will be prepared and signed.&quot;

In January 2013, the county manager of Arlington County, Virginia, and the executive director of the Army National Military Cemeteries (consisting of Arlington National Cemetery and the United States Soldiers&#x27; and Airmen&#x27;s Home National Cemetery) signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the Arlington County Board and the Department of the Army to expand the cemetery even further. Under the tentative plan, Arlington County would give up the easement for Southgate Road (which lies between the Navy Annex property and the cemetery&#x27;s 2012 boundary), and obtain a narrow easement along the southwest border of the Navy Annex site for a new Southgate Road. In exchange, the Department of Defense would give the Navy Annex parking lot to the county.

The Army would also transfer land west of South Joyce Street to Columbia Pike to Arlington County. Additionally, the Commonwealth of Virginia would convey to the cemetery roughly the northern half of the Virginia Department of Transportation land bounded by South Joyce Street, Columbia Pike, and South Washington Boulevard. The cloverleaf interchange between Columbia Pike and S. Washington Blvd. would be eliminated, and the hairpin turn in Columbia Pike straightened, to provide a safer, more natural exit from S. Washington Blvd. onto Columbia Pike. Although exact acreages were not specified and the plan depended upon the Commonwealth of Virginia&#x27;s cooperation, the MOU if implemented would have created a more contiguous plot of land for the cemetery.

On 12 March 2013, the Corps of Engineers released a revised environmental assessment for the Millennium Project. 

The revised environmental assessment included copies of a number of public comments on the draft that criticized the project and parts of the assessment while proposing alternative locations for new military burials near the cemetery and elsewhere. However, the Department of Forestry of the Commonwealth of Virginia found that, based on information in the draft environmental assessment, the project would not have a significant adverse impact on the Commonwealth&#x27;s forest resources. The revised EA did not change the preferred alternative (Alternative E) or the Army&#x27;s plans to prepare and sign the Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) that the draft EA had described.

On 26 March 2013, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (Public Law 113–6) appropriated to the DoD $84 million to plan, design and construct the Millennium Project. The legislation additionally appropriated to the DoD $19 million to study, plan and design a future expansion of the cemetery&#x27;s burial space.

On 5 June 2013, after reviewing 100 public comments that it had received on the revised environmental assessment, the Corps of Engineers released a final EA and a signed FONSI for the Millennium Project. The Final EA and the FONSI retained Alternative E as the preferred alternative. The final environmental assessment stated that, of the 905 trees to be removed, 771 trees were healthy native trees that had diameters between six and 41 inches. 

The project involved removing approximately 211 trees from a less than area containing a portion of a 145-year-old forest that stood within the property boundaries of a historic district that a National Register of Historic Places nomination form for Arlington House had described in 1966. About 491 trees would be removed from an area of trees that was approximately 105 years old. Approximately 203 trees with ages of 50 to 145 years would be removed from a former picnic area. At a public hearing on 11 July 2013, the National Capital Planning Commission approved the site and building plans for the Millennium Project.

In August 2015, the U.S. Army removed Lechner as superintendent of the cemetery after a performance review &quot;called into question his ability to serve successfully as a senior leader&quot;. The Army declined to elaborate further and appointed Hallinan to be the temporary Cemetery superintendent until the Army could find a successor.
In December 2016, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (Public Law 114–328) authorized the Secretary of the Army to expand the cemetery by acquiring from Arlington County and the Commonwealth of Virginia by condemnation and other means properties near the cemetery that contain the Southgate Road, South Joyce Street and Washington Boulevard right-of-ways, including the Washington Boulevard-Columbia Pike interchange. The Army then informed the Arlington County government in June 2017 that the Army would no longer pursue a land exchange with the county. The Army told the County that the Army would use the entire Navy Annex site to expand the cemetery and would acquire for the cemetery about of public land that Arlington County then owned. The Army would also acquire for the cemetery expansion about of land located between Columbia Pike and Interstate 395 that the Commonwealth of Virginia then owned.

In 2018, the US Army Corps of Engineers announced the expansion would allow for 40,000 to 60,000 additional burials and will incorporate the existing United States Air Force Memorial. Construction of roadways is planned for 2021–2023 and of the actual cemetery 2023–2025. Total cost of the project is $274 million. The project covers and by closing and relocating local roadways, allows the cemetery to utilize the former Navy annex property and remain contiguous. The Columbia Pike and interchange will be realigned to maximize burial space. The existing Operations Complex will also be relocated south of the Columbia Pike and its current location will become burial space. The expansion is projected to keep the cemetery open into the middle of the century.

==== 150th anniversary ====
During May and June 2014, the cemetery celebrated the 150th anniversary of its founding with a month-long series of events, tours, and lectures. During these celebrations, cemetery officials formally re-designated the Old Amphitheater as the James Tanner Amphitheater. James R. Tanner was a Union Army officer who lost both legs during the war. He later became a War Department stenographer, and recorded much of the early evidence in the investigation into the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. He later was active in the Grand Army of the Republic, a Union Army veterans group. Tanner is buried a few yards from the amphitheater.

===Management===
On 2 March 2017, Katharine Kelley, a former U.S. Army officer and senior executive service civilian employee for the Department of the Army, was appointed superintendent of the cemetery. She moved to another Army position in March 2019.

Three years later, on 18 February 2020, Charles R. &quot;Ray&quot; Alexander, a former U.S. Army colonel and senior executive service civilian employee for the Department of the Army, was appointed superintendent of the cemetery.

==Sections==

The Cemetery is divided into 70 sections, with some sections in the southeast and western part of the cemetery reserved for future expansion. Section 60, in the southeast part of the cemetery, is the burial ground for military personnel killed in the &quot;war on terror&quot; since 2001. Section 21, also known as the Nurses Section, is the burial site for many nurses, and the location of the Spanish–American War Nurses Memorial and the Nurses Memorial. Another sectionChaplains Hillincludes monuments to Jewish, Protestant, and Roman Catholic military chaplains.

In 1901, Confederate soldiers buried at the Soldiers&#x27; Home and various locations within Arlington were reinterred in a Confederate section that was authorized by Congress in 1900. On 4 June 1914, the United Daughters of the Confederacy dedicated the Confederate Memorial designed by Moses Ezekiel. Upon his death in 1917, Ezekiel was buried at the base of the monument as he was a veteran of the Confederate army. All Confederate headstones in this section are peaked rather than rounded. The Naming Commission, appointed by Congress, has recommended removing the Confederate memorial down to its foundation.

More than 3,800 formerly enslaved people, called &quot;Contrabands&quot; during the Civil War, were buried in Section 27 between 1864 and 1867. Their headstones are designated with the word &quot;Civilian&quot; or &quot;Citizen&quot;.

==Grave markers, niches, and headstones==

The United States Department of Veterans Affairs oversees the National Cemetery Administration&#x27;s orders for placement of inscriptions and faith emblems at no charge to the estate of the deceased, submitted with information provided by the next of kin that is placed on upright marble headstones or columbarium niche covers. The Department of Veterans Affairs currently offers 63 authorized faith emblems for placement on markers to represent the deceased&#x27;s faith. Over time this number grew as the result of legal challenges to policy.

Prior to 2007, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) did not allow the use of the pentacle as an &quot;emblem of belief&quot; on tombstones in military cemeteries. This policy was changed following an out-of-court settlement on 23 April following a series of lawsuits by the family of Patrick Stewart against the VA.

Between 1947 and 2001, privately purchased markers were permitted in the cemetery. The sections in which the cemetery permitted such markers are nearly filled and the cemetery generally does not allow new burials in these sections. Nevertheless, the older sections of the cemetery have a wide variety of private markers placed prior to 2001, including an artillery piece.

There are 32 British Commonwealth war dead burials, 12 from World War I and 20 from World War II and some headstones are Commonwealth War Graves Commission style.

==Arlington Memorial Amphitheater==
The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is part of the Arlington Memorial Amphitheater. The Memorial Amphitheater has hosted state funerals and Memorial Day and Veterans Day ceremonies. Ceremonies are also held for Easter. About 5,000 people attend these holiday ceremonies each year. The structure is mostly built of Imperial Danby marble from Vermont. The Memorial Display room, between the amphitheater and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, uses Botticino stone, imported from Italy. The amphitheater was the result of a campaign by Ivory Kimball to construct a place to honor America&#x27;s servicemen/women. Congress authorized the structure on 4 March 1913. Woodrow Wilson laid the cornerstone for the building on 15 October 1915. The cornerstone contained 15 items including a Bible and a copy of the Constitution.

Before the Arlington Memorial Amphitheater was completed in 1921, important ceremonies were held at what is now known as the &quot;Old Amphitheater&quot;. This structure sits where Robert E. Lee once had his gardens. The amphitheater was built in 1868 under the direction of Civil War General John A. Logan. Gen. James A. Garfield was the featured speaker at the Decoration Day dedication ceremony, 30 May 1868, later being elected as President of the United States in 1881. The amphitheater has an encircling colonnade with a latticed roof that once supported a web of vines. The amphitheater has a marble dais, known as &quot;the &quot;, which is inscribed with the U.S. national motto found on the Great Seal of the United States, &quot;E pluribus unum&quot; (&quot;Out of many, one&quot;). The rostrum was designed by General Montgomery C. Meigs, then Quartermaster General of the U.S. Army. The amphitheater seats 1,500 people and has hosted speakers such as William Jennings Bryan.

==Memorials==
===Tomb of the Unknown Soldier===

The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier stands on top of a hill overlooking Washington, D.C. One of the more well-attended sites at the cemetery, the tomb is made from Yule marble quarried in Colorado. It consists of seven pieces, with a total weight of 79 short tons (72 metric tons). The tomb was completed and opened to the public 9 April 1932, at a cost of $48,000.

Other unknown servicemen were later placed in crypts there, and it also became known as the Tomb of the Unknowns, though it has never been officially named. The soldiers entombed there are:
* Unknown Soldier of World War I, entombed 11 November 1921; President Warren G. Harding presided
* Unknown Soldier of World War II, interred 30 May 1958; President Dwight D. Eisenhower presided
* Unknown Soldier of the Korean War, also interred 30 May 1958; President Dwight Eisenhower presided again, Vice President Richard Nixon acted as next of kin
* Unknown Soldier of the Vietnam War, interred 28 May 1984; President Ronald Reagan presided. The remains of the Vietnam Unknown were disinterred, under the authority of President Bill Clinton, on 14 May 1998, and were identified as those of Air Force first Lt. Michael J. Blassie, whose family had them reinterred near their home in St. Louis, Missouri. It has been determined that the crypt at the Tomb of the Unknowns that contained the remains of the Vietnam Unknown will remain empty.

The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier has been perpetually guarded since 2 July 1937, by the U.S. Army. The 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment (&quot;The Old Guard&quot;) began guarding the Tomb on 6 April 1948. There is a meticulous routine that the guard follows when watching over the graves. The Tomb Guard:
# Marches 21 steps southward down the black mat behind the Tomb
# Turns left, facing east for 21 seconds
# Turns left, facing north for 21 seconds
# Takes 21 steps down the mat
# Repeats the routine until the soldier is relieved of duty at the changing of the guard

After each turn, the Guard executes a sharp &quot;shoulder-arms&quot; movement to place the weapon on the shoulder closest to the visitors to signify that the Guard stands between the Tomb and any possible threat.

Twenty-one was chosen because it symbolizes the highest military honor that can be bestowedthe 21-gun salute.

At each turn, the guard makes precise movements followed by a loud click of the heels as the soldier snaps them together. The guard is changed every half-hour during daylight in the summer, and every hour during daylight in the winter and every two hours at night (when the cemetery is closed to the public), regardless of weather conditions.
A commemorative stamp was issued on 11 November 1922, the first anniversary of the first entombment picturing the Amphitheater. It encompasses the original Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The remains of an unidentified American soldier from World War I were entombed on Armistice Day, 11 November 1921, later covered in 1931 by a more elaborate marble sarcophagus.

===Other memorials===

There are several memorials on the grounds of the cemetery. However, due to the lack of space for burials and the large amount of space that memorials take up, the U.S. Army now requires a joint or concurrent resolution from Congress before it will place new memorials at Arlington.

Near the Tomb of the Unknowns stands the USS &quot;Maine&quot; Mast Memorial, which commemorates the 266 men who died aboard the USS &quot;Maine&quot;. The memorial is built around a mast salvaged from the ship&#x27;s wreckage. The memorial served as the temporary resting place for two foreign heads of state or government who died in exile in the United States during World War II, Manuel L. Quezon of the Philippines and Ignacy Jan Paderewski of Poland.

The Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; Memorial was dedicated on 20 May 1986, in memory of the crew of flight STS-51-L, who died during launch on 28 January 1986. Transcribed on the back of the stone is the text of the John Gillespie Magee, Jr. poem &quot;High Flight&quot;, which was quoted by then President Ronald Reagan when he addressed the disaster. Although many remains were identified and returned to the families for private burial, some were not, and were laid to rest under the marker. Two crew members, Dick Scobee and Michael Smith, are buried in Arlington. On 1 February 2004, NASA Administrator Sean O&#x27;Keefe dedicated a similar memorial to those who died when the Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; broke apart during reentry on 1 February 2003. Astronauts Laurel Clark, David Brown, and Michael Anderson, who were killed in the &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster, are also buried in Arlington.

The Lockerbie Cairn is a memorial to the 270 killed in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. The memorial is constructed of 270 stones, one for each person killed in the disaster. In section 64, a memorial to the 184 victims of the 11 September attacks on the Pentagon was dedicated 11 September 2002. The memorial takes the shape of a pentagon, and lists the names of all the victims that were killed. Unidentified remains from the victims are buried beneath it.

On 25 June 1925, President Calvin Coolidge approved a request to erect a Commonwealth Cross of Sacrifice with the names of all the citizens of the United States who died fighting in the Canadian forces during World War I. The monument was dedicated 11 November 1927, and after the Korean War and World War II the names of US citizens who died in those conflicts were added.

In 2008, a bronze Braille flag was installed as a monument to blinded or blind veterans, service members, and other Americans after the passing of the H.R. 4169 American Braille Flag Memorial Act.

The Laos Memorial, or Lao Veterans of America memorial, dedicated to Lao and Hmong veterans who served with US Special Forces and CIA advisors during the Vietnam War, to defend the Royal Kingdom of Laos from the North Vietnamese invasion of Laos, is located on Grant Avenue near the eternal flame memorial to U.S. President John F. Kennedy.

In 2012, legislation began moving through Congress to approve a &quot;Place of Remembrance&quot; at the cemetery. The memorial will be an ossuary designed to contain fragments of remains which are unidentifiable through DNA analysis. The remains will be cremated before placement in the memorial.

==Burial procedures==
The flags in the cemetery are flown at half-staff from a half-hour before the first funeral until a half hour after the last funeral each day. Funerals are normally conducted five days a week, excluding weekends.

Funerals, including interments and inurnments, average between 27 and 30 per day. The cemetery conducts approximately 6,900 burials each year.

With more than 400,000 interments, the cemetery has the second-largest number of burials of any national cemetery in the United States. The largest of the 130 national cemeteries is Calverton National Cemetery, on Long Island, near Riverhead, New York, which conducts more than 7,000 burials annually.

In addition to in-ground burial, the cemetery also has one of the larger columbaria for cremated remains in the country. Four courts are currently in use, each with 5,000 niches. When construction is complete, there will be nine courts with a total of 50,000 niches; capacity for 100,000 remains. Any honorably discharged veteran is eligible for inurnment in the columbarium, if they served on active duty at some point in their career (other than for training).

===Burial criteria===
Part 553 (Army National Military Cemeteries) of Title 32 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) establishes regulations for the cemetery, including eligibility for interment (ground burial) and inurnment. Due to limited space, the criteria for ground burial eligibility are more restrictive than at other national cemeteries, as well as more restrictive than for inurnment in the columbarium.

The persons specified below are eligible for ground burial in the cemetery, unless otherwise prohibited. The last period of active duty of former members of the armed forces must have ended honorably. Interment may be of casketed or cremated remains.
* Any active-duty member of the armed forces (except those members serving on active duty for training only)
* Any veteran who is retired and eligible for retirement pay from service in the armed forces, including service members retired from a reserve component who served a period of active duty (other than for training)
* Any former member of the armed forces separated honorably prior to 1 October 1949, for medical reasons and who was rated at 30% or greater disabled effective on the day of discharge
* Any former member of the armed forces who has been awarded one of the following decorations:
** Medal of Honor
** Distinguished Service Cross, Navy Cross, or Air Force Cross
** Silver Star
** Purple Heart
* Any former member of the armed forces who served on active duty (other than for training) and who held any of the following positions:
** An elective office of the U.S. Government (such as a term in Congress)
** Office of the Chief Justice of the United States or of an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States
** An office listed, at the time the person held the position, in 5 USC 5312 or 5313 (Levels I and II of the Executive Schedule)
** The chief of a mission who was at any time during his/her tenure classified in Class I under the provisions of Section 411, Act of 13 August 1946, 60 Stat. 1002, as amended (22 USC 866) or as listed in State Department memorandum dated 21 March 1988
* Any former prisoner of war who, while a prisoner of war, served honorably in the active military, naval, or air service, whose last period of military, naval or air service terminated honorably and who died on or after 30 November 1993
* The spouse, widow or widower, minor child, or permanently dependent child, and certain unmarried adult children of any of the above eligible veterans

* The widow or widower of:
** a member of the armed forces who was lost or buried at sea or fell out of a plane or officially determined to be permanently absent with a status of either missing or missing in action
** a member of the armed forces who is interred in a US military cemetery overseas that is maintained by the American Battle Monuments Commission
* The spouse, minor child, or permanently dependent child of any person already buried in Arlington National Cemetery
* The parents of a minor child, or permanently dependent child whose remains, based on the eligibility of a parent, are already buried at Arlington. A spouse divorced from the primary eligible, or widowed and remarried, is not eligible for interment
* Provided certain conditions are met, a former member of the armed forces may be buried in the same grave with a close relative who is already buried and is the primary eligible

===Inurnment criteria for columbarium===
Due at least partly to the lack of space at the cemetery for ground burial, standards for inurnment (burial of cremated remains) in the columbarium are currently much less restrictive than for ground burial at the cemetery. In general, any former member of the armed forces who served on active duty (other than for training) and whose last service terminated honorably is eligible for inurnment. Eligibility for inurnment is described fully in 32 C.F.R. § 553.15a.

===Prohibitions against interment or memorialization===
Congress has from time to time created prohibited categories of persons that, even if otherwise eligible for burial, lose that eligibility. One such prohibition is against certain persons who are convicted of committing certain state or federal capital crimes, as defined in 38 U.S. Code § 2411. Capital crime is a specifically defined term in the statute, and for state offenses can include offenses that are eligible for a life sentence (with or without parole). The reasoning for this provision originally was to prevent Timothy McVeigh from being eligible at Arlington National Cemetery, but it has since been amended to prevent others.

==Notable burials==
The first soldier to be buried in Arlington was Private William Henry Christman of Pennsylvania on 13 May 1864. There are 396 Medal of Honor recipients buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

Five state funerals have been held at Arlington: those of Presidents William Howard Taft and John F. Kennedy, his two brothers, Senator Robert F. Kennedy and Senator Edward &quot;Ted&quot; Kennedy, as well as General of the Armies John J. Pershing. Whether or not they were wartime service members, U.S. presidents are eligible to be buried at Arlington, since they oversaw the armed forces as commanders-in-chief.

Among the most frequently visited sites in the cemetery is the grave of President John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy, who is buried nearby along with their son Patrick and their stillborn daughter Arabella. Kennedy&#x27;s remains were interred there on 14 March 1967, a reinterment from his original Arlington burial site, some away, where he was buried in November 1963. The grave is marked with an &quot;eternal flame&quot;. The remains of his brothers, Senator Robert F. Kennedy and Senator Edward M. &quot;Ted&quot; Kennedy along with Robert&#x27;s wife Ethel Kennedy, are buried nearby. The latter two graves are marked with simple crosses and footstones. On 1 December 1971, Robert Kennedy&#x27;s body was re-interred from its original June 1968 burial site.

The Secretary of Commerce, Ron Brown, was buried after he and 34 others died in the crash of a CT-43 in Croatia in 1996. 

Two of the astronauts who were killed on 27 January 1967, by a flash fire inside the Apollo 1 command module, Gus Grissom and Roger Chaffee, are buried at the cemetery. John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth and a longtime U.S. Senator from Ohio, was buried at the cemetery in April 2017.

British diplomat and Field Marshal Sir John Dill was buried at the cemetery when he died in Washington D.C. during World War II. The equestrian statue on Dill&#x27;s grave is one of only two such statues at the cemetery; the other is Major General Philip Kearny&#x27;s.

Lauri Törni, known for having served in the Finnish army during the Winter War, the German army during World War II, and the US army during the Vietnam War is buried at Arlington. He is the only former member of the Waffen-SS to be interred here.

==Visitor requirements==
In 2016, the cemetery announced policies and procedures that limit visitor access to the cemetery&#x27;s grounds, some of which were thought to possibly create delays for visitors.

===Bicycle use===
Pursuant to the Department of the Army final rule established in 2016, the cemetery&#x27;s bicycle policy states bicycling presents a potential safety hazard, and is only allowed on its grounds with a family pass.

===Security procedures===
In September 2016, acting superintendent of the cemetery Patrick Hallinan announced that the cemetery was increasing security measures for its visitors. In addition to random identification checks and other security measures already in place, the cemetery would require pedestrians to enter at set access points: the main entrance on Memorial Avenue, the Ord and Weitzel gate, and the Old Post Chapel gate at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall. Before entering the cemetery through its main entrance, all pedestrians are now screened through the cemetery&#x27;s Welcome Center. All vehicle access requires presenting valid, government-issued photo identification, such as a driver&#x27;s license or passport, when entering the cemetery. Vehicles are also subject to random inspections. Hallinan stated that these processes could result in delays when entering the cemetery.

<text>Counterterrorism (alternatively spelled: counter-terrorism), also known as anti-terrorism, relates to the practices, military tactics, techniques, and strategies that governments, law enforcement, businesses, and intelligence agencies use to combat or eliminate terrorism and violent extremism.

If an act of terrorism occurs as part of a broader insurgency (and insurgency is included in the definition of terrorism) then counterterrorism may additionally employ counterinsurgency measures. The United States Armed Forces uses the term &quot;foreign internal defense&quot; for programs that support other countries&#x27; attempts to suppress insurgency, lawlessness, or subversion, or to reduce the conditions under which threats to national security may develop.

== History ==
The first counterterrorism body to be formed was the Special Irish Branch of the Metropolitan Police, later renamed the Special Branch after it expanded its scope beyond its original focus on Fenian terrorism. Various law enforcement agencies established similar units in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.

The International Conference of Rome for the Social Defense Against Anarchists has been identified as the first international conference against terrorism.

The first tactical counterterrorist unit was GSG 9 of the German Federal Police, formed in response to the 1972 Munich massacre.

Counterterrorist forces expanded with the perceived growing threat of terrorism in the late 20th century. After the September 11 attacks, Western governments made counterterrorism efforts a priority. This included more extensive collaboration with foreign governments, shifting tactics involving red teams, and preventive measures.

Although terrorist attacks affecting Western countries generally receive a disproportionately large share of media attention, most terrorism occurs in less developed countries. Government responses to terrorism, in some cases, tend to lead to substantial unintended consequences, such as what occurred in the above-mentioned Munich massacre.

== Planning ==
=== Intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance ===

Most counterterrorism strategies involve an increase in policing and domestic intelligence gathering. Central techniques include intercepting communications and location tracking. New technology has expanded the range of military and law enforcement options for intelligence gathering. Many countries increasingly employ facial recognition systems in policing.

Domestic intelligence gathering is sometimes directed to specific ethnic or religious groups, which are the sources of political conversy. Mass surveillance of an entire population raises objections on civil liberties grounds. Domestic terrorists, especially lone wolves, are often harder to detect because of their citizenship or legal status and ability to stay under the radar.

To select the effective action when terrorism appears to be more of an isolated event, the appropriate government organizations need to understand the source, motivation, methods of preparation, and tactics of terrorist groups. Good intelligence is at the heart of such preparation, as well as a political and social understanding of any grievances that might be solved. Ideally, one gets information from inside the group, a very difficult challenge for human intelligence operations because operational terrorist cells are often small, with all members known to one another, perhaps even related.

Counterintelligence is a great challenge with the security of cell-based systems, since the ideal, but the nearly impossible, goal is to obtain a clandestine source within the cell. Financial tracking can play a role, as a communications intercept. However, both of these approaches need to be balanced against legitimate expectations of privacy.

=== Legal contexts ===
In response to the growing legislation.
* The United Kingdom has had counterterrorism legislation in place for more than thirty years. The Prevention of Violence Act 1938 was brought in response to an Irish Republican Army (IRA) campaign of violence under the S-Plan. This act had been allowed to expire in 1953. It was repealed in 1973 to be replaced by the Prevention of Terrorism Acts, a response to the Troubles in Northern Ireland. From 1974 to 1989, the temporary provisions of the act were renewed annually. Their original counterterrorism legislation was used to predict future IRA attacks and respond accordingly based on their predictions. For example, if British Security Forces attacked, they predicted the IRA would target civilian areas as a response.
* In 2000 the Acts were replaced with the more permanent Terrorism Act 2000, which contained many of their powers, and then the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005.
* The Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 was formally introduced into the Parliament on November 19, 2001, two months after the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States. It received royal assent and went into force on December 13, 2001. On December 16, 2004, the Law Lords ruled that Part 4 was incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. However, under the terms of the Human Rights Act 1998, it remained in force. The Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 was drafted to answer the Law Lords ruling and the Terrorism Act 2006 creates new offenses related to terrorism, and amends existing ones. The act was drafted in the aftermath of the 7 July 2005 London bombings and, like its predecessors, some of its terms have proven to be highly controversial.

Since 1978 the UK&#x27;s terrorism laws have been regularly reviewed by a security-cleared Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, whose often influential reports are submitted to Parliament and published in full.
* U.S. legal issues surrounding this issue include rulings on the domestic employment of deadly force by law enforcement agencies.
* Search and seizure is governed by the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
* The U.S. passed the Patriot Act after the September 11 attacks, as well as a range of other legislation and executive orders relating to national security.
* The Department of Homeland Security was established to consolidate domestic security agencies to coordinate counterterrorism and national response to major natural disasters and accidents.
* The United States Coast Guard&#x27;s mission, only military branch with law enforcement jurisdiction to board and seize &quot;The direct or indirect supply, sale, or transfer of weapons to terrorist organizations violates U.N. Security Resolution 2216 (as extended and renewed by resolutions 2675 and 2707) and international law.&quot;
* The Posse Comitatus Act limits domestic employment of the United States Army and the United States Air Force, requiring Presidential approval before deploying the Army or the Air Force. Department of Defense policy also applies this limitation to the United States Marine Corps and the United States Navy, because the Posse Comitatus Act does not cover naval services, even though they are federal military forces. The Department of Defense can be employed domestically on Presidential order, as was done during the Los Angeles riots of 1992, Hurricane Katrina, and the Beltway Sniper incidents.
* External or international use of lethal force would require a Presidential finding.
* In February 2017, sources claimed that the Trump administration intends to rename and revamp the U.S. government program Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) to focus solely on Islamist extremism.
; 
* Australia has passed several counterterrorism acts. In 2004, a bill comprising three acts Anti-terrorism Act, 2004, (No 2) and (No 3) was passed. Then Attorney-General, Philip Ruddock, introduced the &quot;Anti-terrorism bill, 2004&quot; on March 31. He described it as &quot;a bill to strengthen Australia&#x27;s counter-terrorism laws in a number of respects – a task made more urgent following the recent tragic terrorist bombings in Spain.&quot; He said that Australia&#x27;s counterterrorism laws &quot;require review and, where necessary, updating if we are to have a legal framework capable of safeguarding all Australians from the scourge of terrorism.&quot; The Australian Anti-Terrorism Act 2005 supplemented the powers of the earlier acts. The Australian legislation allows police to detain suspects for up to two weeks without charge and to electronically track suspects for up to a year. The Australian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2005 included a &quot;shoot-to-kill&quot; clause. In a country with entrenched liberal democratic traditions, the measures are controversial and have been criticized by civil libertarians and Islamic groups.
; 
* Israel monitors a list of designated terrorist organizations and has laws forbidding membership in such organizations and funding or helping them.
* On December 14, 2006, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled targeted killings were a permitted form of self-defense.
* In 2016 the Israeli Knesset passed a comprehensive law against terrorism, forbidding any kind of terrorism and support of terrorism, and setting severe punishments for terrorists. The law also regulates legal efforts against terrorism.

=== Human rights ===
One of the primary difficulties of implementing effective counterterrorist measures is the waning of civil liberties and individual privacy that such measures often entail, both for citizens of, and for those detained by states attempting to combat terror. At times, measures designed to tighten security have been seen as abuses of power or even violations of human rights.

Examples of these problems can include prolonged, incommunicado detention without judicial review or long periods of &#x27;preventive detention&#x27;; risk of subjecting to torture during the transfer, return and extradition of people between or within countries; and the adoption of security measures that restrain the rights or freedoms of citizens and breach principles of non-discrimination. Examples include:

* In November 2003, Malaysia passed new counterterrorism laws, widely criticized by local human rights groups for being vague and overbroad. Critics claim that the laws put the fundamental rights of free expression, association, and assembly at risk. Malaysia persisted in holding around 100 alleged militants without trial, including five Malaysian students detained for alleged terrorist activity while studying in Karachi, Pakistan.
* In November 2003, a Canadian-Syrian national, Maher Arar, publicly alleged that he had been tortured in a Syrian prison after being handed over to the Syrian authorities by the U.S.
* In December 2003, Colombia&#x27;s congress approved legislation that would give the military the power to arrest, tap telephones, and carry out searches without warrants or any previous judicial order.
* Images of torture and ill-treatment of detainees in U.S. custody in Iraq and other locations have encouraged international scrutiny of U.S. operations in the war on terror.
* Hundreds of foreign nationals remain in prolonged indefinite detention without charge or trial in Guantánamo Bay, despite international and U.S. constitutional standards some groups believe outlaw such practices.
* Hundreds of people suspected of connections with the Taliban or Al-Qaeda remain in long-term detention in Pakistan or in U.S.-controlled centers in Afghanistan without trial.
* China has used the &quot;war on terror&quot; to justify its policies in the predominantly Muslim Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region to stifle Uyghur identity.
* In Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Yemen, and other countries, scores of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in connection with suspected terrorist acts or links to opposition armed groups.
* Until 2005, eleven men remained in high security detention in the UK under the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001.
* United Nations experts condemned the misuse of counterterrorism powers by the Egyptian authorities following the arrest, detention, and designation of human rights activists Ramy Shaath and Zyad El-Elaimy as terrorists. The two activists were arrested in June 2019, and the first-ever renewal of remand detention for Shaath came for the 21st time in 19 months on 24 January 2021. Experts called it alarming, and demanded the urgent implementation of the Working Group&#x27;s opinion and removal of the two&#x27;s names from the &quot;terrorism entities&#x27; list.

Many argue that such violations of rights could exacerbate rather than counter the terrorist threat. Human rights activists argue for the crucial role of human rights protection as an intrinsic part to fight against terrorism. This suggests, as proponents of human security have long argued, that respecting human rights may indeed help us to incur security. Amnesty International included a section on confronting terrorism in the recommendations in the Madrid Agenda arising from the Madrid Summit on Democracy and Terrorism (Madrid March 8–11, 2005):

While international efforts to combat terrorism have focused on the need to enhance cooperation between states, proponents of human rights (as well as human security) have suggested that more effort needs to be given to the effective inclusion of human rights protection as a crucial element in that cooperation. They argue that international human rights obligations do not stop at borders, and a failure to respect human rights in one state may undermine its effectiveness in the global effort to cooperate to combat terrorism.

=== Preemptive neutralization ===
Some countries see preemptive attacks as a legitimate strategy. This includes capturing, killing, or disabling suspected terrorists before they can mount an attack. Israel, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Russia have taken this approach, while Western European states generally do not.

Another major method of preemptive neutralization is the interrogation of known or suspected terrorists to obtain information about specific plots, targets, the identity of other terrorists, whether or not the interrogation subjects himself is guilty of terrorist involvement. Sometimes more extreme methods are used to increase suggestibility, such as sleep deprivation or drugs. Such methods may lead captives to offer false information in an attempt to stop the treatment, or due to the confusion caused by it. In 1978 the European Court of Human Rights ruled in the Ireland v. United Kingdom case that such methods amounted to a practice of inhuman and degrading treatment, and that such practices were in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights Article 3 (art. 3).

==== Non-military ====
The human security paradigm outlines a non-military approach that aims to address the enduring underlying inequalities which fuel terrorist activity. Causal factors need to be delineated and measures implemented which allow equal access to resources and sustainability for all people. Such activities empower citizens, providing &quot;freedom from fear&quot; and &quot;freedom from want&quot;.

This can take many forms, including the provision of clean drinking water, education, vaccination programs, provision of food and shelter and protection from violence, military or otherwise. Successful human security campaigns have been characterized by the participation of a diverse group of actors, including governments, NGOs, and citizens.

Foreign internal defense programs provide outside expert assistance to a threatened government. FID can involve both non-military and military aspects of counterterrorism.

A 2017 study found that &quot;governance and civil society aid is effective in dampening domestic terrorism, but this effect is only present if the recipient country is not experiencing a civil conflict.&quot;
==== Military ====

Terrorism has often been used to justify military intervention in countries where terrorists are said to be based. Similar justifications were used for the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan and the second Russian invasion of Chechnya.

Military intervention has not always been successful in stopping or preventing future terrorism, such as during the Malayan Emergency, the Mau Mau uprising, and most of the campaigns against the IRA during the Irish Civil War, the S-Plan, the Border Campaign, and the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Although military action can temporarily disrupt a terrorist group&#x27;s operations temporarily, it sometimes does not end the threat completely.

Repression by the military in itself usually leads to short term victories, but tend to be unsuccessful in the long run (e.g., the French doctrine used in colonial Indochina and Algeria), particularly if it is not accompanied by other measures. However, new methods such as those taken in Iraq have yet to be seen as beneficial or ineffectual.

== Preparation ==
=== Target hardening ===
Whatever the target of terrorists, there are multiple ways of hardening the targets to prevent the terrorists from hitting their mark, or reducing the damage of attacks. One method is to place hostile vehicle mitigation to enforce protective standoff distance outside tall or politically sensitive buildings to prevent car bombings. Another way to reduce the impact of attacks is to design buildings for rapid evacuation.

Aircraft cockpits are kept locked during flights and have reinforced doors, which only the pilots in the cabin are capable of opening. UK railway stations removed their garbage bins in response to the Provisional IRA threat, as convenient locations for depositing bombs. Scottish stations removed theirs after the 7 July 2005 London Bombings as a precautionary measure. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority purchased bomb-resistant barriers after the September 11 attacks.

Due to frequent shelling of Israel&#x27;s cities, towns, and settlements by artillery rockets from the Gaza Strip (mainly by Hamas, but also by other Palestinian factions) and Lebanon (mainly by Hezbollah), Israel has developed several defensive measures against artillery, rockets, and missiles. These include building a bomb shelter in every building and school, but also deploying active protection systems such as the Arrow ABM, Iron Dome and David&#x27;s Sling, which intercept the incoming threat in the air. Iron Dome has successfully intercepted hundreds of Qassam rockets and Grad rockets fired by Palestinians from the Gaza Strip.

A more sophisticated target-hardening approach must consider industrial and other critical industrial infrastructure that could be attacked. Terrorists do not need to import chemical weapons if they can cause a major industrial accident such as the Bhopal disaster or the Halifax Explosion. Industrial chemicals in manufacturing, shipping, and storage thus require greater protection, and some efforts are in progress.

Equipping likely targets with containers of pig lard has been used to discourage attacks by suicide bombers. The technique was apparently used on a limited scale by British authorities in the 1940s. The approach stems from the idea that Muslims perpetrating the attack would not want to be &quot;soiled&quot; by the lard in the moment before dying. The idea has been suggested more recently as a deterrent to suicide bombings in Israel. However, the actual effectiveness of this tactic is likely limited. A sympathetic Islamic scholar could issue a fatwa proclaiming that a suicide bomber would not be polluted by the swine products.

=== Command and control ===
For a threatened or completed terrorist attack, an Incident Command System (ICS) may be invoked to control the various services that may need to be involved in the response. ICS has varied levels of escalation, such as might be required for multiple incidents in a given area (e.g. 2005 London bombings or the 2004 Madrid train bombings), or all the way to a National Response Plan invocation if national-level resources are needed. For example, a national response might be required for a nuclear, biological, radiological, or significant chemical attack.

=== Damage mitigation ===
Fire departments, perhaps supplemented by public works agencies, utility providers, and heavy construction contractors, are most apt to deal with the physical consequences of an attack.

=== Local security ===
Again under an incident command model, local police can isolate the incident area, reducing confusion, and specialized police units can conduct tactical operations against terrorists, often using specialized counterterrorist tactical units. Bringing in such units will typically involve civil or military authority beyond the local level.

=== Medical services ===
Emergency medical services are capable of triaging, treating, and transporting the more severely affected individuals to hospitals, which typically have mass casualty and triage plans in place for terrorist attacks.

From the local to the national level, public health agencies may be designated to deal with identification or mitigation of possible biological attacks, including chemical or radiological contamination.

== Tactical units ==
Many countries have dedicated counterterrorist units trained to handle terrorist threats. Besides various security agencies, there are police tactical units whose role is to directly engage terrorists and prevent terrorist attacks. Such units perform both in preventive actions, hostage rescue, and responding to ongoing attacks. Countries of all sizes can have highly trained counterterrorist teams. Tactics, techniques, and procedures for manhunting are under constant development.

These units are specially trained in military tactics and are equipped for close-quarters combat, with emphasis on stealth and performing the mission with minimal casualties. The units include assault teams, snipers, EOD experts, dog handlers, and intelligence officers. Most of these measures deal with terrorist attacks that affect an area or threaten to do so, or are lengthy situations such as shootouts and standoffs that allow the counterterrorist units to assemble and respond; it is harder to deal with shorter incidents such as assassinations, reprisal attacks, or bombings due to the short warning time and the quick exfiltration of the perpetrators.

The majority of counterterrorism operations at the tactical level are conducted by state, federal, and national law enforcement or intelligence agencies. In some countries, the military may be called in as a last resort. For countries whose military is legally permitted to conduct domestic law enforcement operations, this is not an issue, and such counterterrorism operations are conducted by their military.

== Counterterrorist operations ==
Some counterterrorist actions of the 20th and 21st centuries are listed below. See list of hostage crises for a more extended list, including hostage-takings that did not end violently.

=== Designing counterterrorist systems ===
The scope for counterterrorism systems is very large in physical terms and in other dimensions, such as type and degree of terrorist threats, political and diplomatic ramifications, and legal concerns. Ideal counterterrorist systems use technology to enable persistent intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions, and potential actions. Designing such a system-of-systems comprises a major technological project.

A particular design problem for counterterrorist systems is the uncertainty of the future: the threat of terrorism may increase, decrease or remain the same, the type of terrorism and location are difficult to predict, and there are technological uncertainties. A potential solution is to incorporate engineering flexibility into system design, allowing for flexibility when new information arrives. Flexibility can be incorporated in the design of a counter-terrorism system in the form of options that can be exercised in the future when new information is available.

=== Law enforcement ===
While some countries with longstanding terrorism problems have law enforcement agencies primarily designed to prevent and respond to terror attacks, in other nations, counterterrorism is a relatively more recent objective of law enforcement agencies.

Though some civil libertarians and criminal justice scholars have criticized efforts of law enforcement agencies to combat terrorism as futile and expensive or as threats to civil liberties, other scholars have analyzed the most important dimensions of the policing of terrorism as an important dimension of counter-terrorism, especially in the post-9/11 era, and have discussed how police view terrorism as a matter of crime control. Such analyses highlight the civilian police role in counterterrorism next to the military model of a war on terror.

==== American law enforcement ====

Pursuant to passage of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies began to systemically reorganize. Two primary federal agencies, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), house most of the federal agencies that are prepared to combat domestic and international terrorist attacks. These include the Border Patrol, the Secret Service, the Coast Guard and the FBI.

Following suit from federal changes pursuant to 9/11, however, most state and local law enforcement agencies began to include a commitment to &quot;fighting terrorism&quot; in their mission statements. Local agencies began to establish more patterned lines of communication with federal agencies. Some scholars have doubted the ability of local police to help in the war on terror and suggest their limited manpower is still best utilized by engaging community and targeting street crimes.

While counter-terror measures (most notably heightened airport security, immigrant profiling and border patrol) have been adapted during the last decade, to enhance counter-terror in law enforcement, there have been remarkable limitations to assessing the actual utility/effectiveness of law enforcement practices that are ostensibly preventative. Thus, while sweeping changes in counterterrorist rhetoric redefined most American post 9/11 law enforcement agencies in theory, it is hard to assess how well such hyperbole has translated into practice.

In intelligence-led policing (ILP) efforts, the most quantitatively amenable starting point for measuring the effectiveness of any policing strategy (i.e.: Neighborhood Watch, Gun Abatement, Foot Patrols, etc.) is usually to assess total financial costs against clearance rates or arrest rates. Since terrorism is such a rare event phenomena, measuring arrests or clearance rates would be a non-generalizable and ineffective way to test enforcement policy effectiveness. Another methodological problem in assessing counterterrorism efforts in law enforcement hinges on finding operational measures for key concepts in the study of homeland security. Both terrorism and homeland security are relatively new concepts for criminologists, and academicians have yet to agree on the matter of how to properly define these ideas in a way that is accessible.

=== Military ===

Given the nature of operational counterterrorism tasks, national military organizations do not generally have dedicated units whose sole responsibility is the prosecution of these tasks. Instead the counterterrorism function is an element of the role, allowing flexibility in their employment, with operations being undertaken in the domestic or international context.

In some cases the legal framework within which they operate prohibits military units conducting operations in the domestic arena; United States Department of Defense policy, based on the Posse Comitatus Act, forbids domestic counterterrorism operations by the U.S. military. Units allocated some operational counterterrorism tasks are frequently special forces or similar assets.

In cases where military organisations do operate in the domestic context, some form of formal handover from the law enforcement community is regularly required, to ensure adherence to the legislative framework and limitations. For instance, during the 1980 Iranian Embassy siege, the Metropolitan Police formally turned responsibility over to the British Army&#x27;s Special Air Service when the situation went beyond police capabilities.

<text>Melanesia (, ) is a subregion of Oceania in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. It extends from New Guinea in the west to the Fiji Islands in the east, and includes the Arafura Sea.

The region includes the four independent countries of Fiji, Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea. It also includes the Indonesian part of New Guinea and the Maluku islands, the French overseas collectivity of New Caledonia, and the Torres Strait Islands. Almost all of the region is in the Southern Hemisphere; only a few small islands that are not politically considered part of Oceania—specifically the northwestern islands of Western New Guinea—lie in the Northern Hemisphere.

The name &quot;Melanesia&quot; (in French, &quot;Mélanésie&quot;) was first used in 1832 by French navigator Jules Dumont d&#x27;Urville: he coined the terms &quot;Melanesia&quot; and &quot;Micronesia&quot; to go alongside the pre-existing &quot;Polynesia&quot; to designate what he viewed as the three main ethnic and geographical regions forming the Pacific.

The indigenous people who inhabit the islands of Melanesia are called Melanesians. This is a heterogenous set of different genetic groups and ethnicities, different cultural practices (mythology, music, art, etc.), and different unrelated language families. Yet together they form a vast area with a long history of exchanges.

==Etymology and name ambiguity==
The name &quot;Melanesia&quot; (from , and ), etymologically means &quot;islands of black [people]&quot;, in reference to the dark skin of the inhabitants.

The concept among Europeans of &quot;Melanesia&quot; as a distinct region evolved gradually over time as their expeditions mapped and explored the Pacific. Early European explorers noted the physical differences among groups of Pacific Islanders. In 1756, Charles de Brosses theorized that there was an &quot;old black race&quot; in the Pacific who had been conquered or defeated by the peoples of what is now called Polynesia, whom he distinguished as having lighter skin. In the first half of the nineteenth century, Jean-Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent and Jules Dumont d&#x27;Urville characterized Melanesians as a distinct racial group. 

Over time, however, Europeans increasingly viewed Melanesians as a distinct cultural, rather than racial, grouping. Scholars and other commentators disagreed on the boundaries of Melanesia, descriptions of which were therefore somewhat fluid. In the nineteenth century, Robert Henry Codrington, a British missionary, produced a series of monographs on &quot;the Melanesians&quot;, based on his long-time residence in the region. In his published works on Melanesia, including &quot;The Melanesian Languages&quot; (1885) and &quot;The Melanesians: Studies in Their Anthropology and Folk-lore&quot; (1891), Codrington defined Melanesia as including Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, New Caledonia, and Fiji. He reasoned that the islands of New Guinea should not be included because only some of its people were Melanesians. Also, like Bory de Saint-Vincent, he excluded Australia from Melanesia. It was in these works that Codrington introduced the Melanesian cultural concept of &quot;mana&quot; to the West.

Uncertainty about the best way to delineate and define the region continues to this day. The scholarly consensus now includes New Guinea within Melanesia. Ann Chowning wrote in her 1977 textbook on Melanesia that there is no general agreement even among anthropologists about the geographical boundaries of Melanesia. Many apply the term only to the smaller islands, excluding New Guinea; Fiji has frequently been treated as an anomalous border region or even assigned wholly to Polynesia; and the people of the Torres Straits Islands are often simply classified as Australian aborigines.

In 1998, Paul Sillitoe wrote: &quot;It is not easy to define precisely, on geographical, cultural, biological, or any other grounds, where Melanesia ends and the neighbouring regions ... begins&quot;. He ultimately concludes that the region is a historical category which evolved in the nineteenth century from the discoveries made in the Pacific and has been legitimated by use and further research in the region. It covers populations that have a certain linguistic, biological and cultural affinity – a certain ill-defined sameness, which shades off at its margins into difference.

Both Sillitoe and Chowning include the island of New Guinea in the definition of Melanesia, and both exclude Australia. Most of the peoples of Melanesia live either in politically independent countries or in regions that currently have active independence movements, such as in Western New Guinea (Indonesia) and New Caledonia (France). Some have recently embraced the term &quot;Melanesia&quot; as a source of identity and empowerment. Stephanie Lawson writes that despite &quot;a number of scholars finding the term problematic due to its historical associations with European exploration and colonisation, as well as the racism embedded in these&quot;, the term &quot;has acquired a positive meaning and relevance for many of the people to whom it applies&quot;, and has &quot;moved from a term of denigration to one of affirmation, providing a positive basis for contemporary subregional identity as well as a formal organisation&quot;. Additionally, while the terms &quot;Polynesia&quot; and &quot;Micronesia&quot; refer to the geographic characteristics of the islands, &quot;Melanesia&quot; specifically refers to the color of the inhabitants as the &quot;black race of Oceania. The author Bernard Narokobi has written that the concept of the &quot;Melanesian Way&quot; as a distinct cultural force could give the people of the region a sense of empowerment. This concept has in fact been used as a force in geopolitics. For instance, when the countries of Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, and Fiji reached a regional preferential trade agreement, they named it the Melanesian Spearhead Group.

==History==
===Ancient history===

The people of Melanesia have a distinctive ancestry. According to the Southern Dispersal theory, hominid populations from Africa dispersed along the southern edge of Asia some 50,000 to 100,000 years ago. For some, the endpoint of this ancient migration was the ancient continent of Sahul, a single landmass comprising both the areas that are now Australia and New Guinea. At that time, they were united by a land bridge, because sea levels were lower than in the present day. The first migration into Sahul was over 40,000 years ago. Some migrants settled in the part that is now New Guinea, while others continued south and became the aboriginal inhabitants of Australia.

Another wave of Austronesian migrants, originating ultimately from Taiwan, arrived in Melanesia much later, probably between 4000 and 3000 BC. They settled mostly along the north coast of New Guinea and on the islands to its north and east. When they arrived, they came into contact with the much more ancient indigenous Papuan-speaking peoples.

Some late-20th-century scholars developed a theory, known as the &quot;Polynesian theory&quot;, that there then followed a long period of interaction between these newcomers and the pre-existing inhabitants that led to many complex genetic, linguistic, and cultural mixing and other changes among the descendants of all the groups. This theory was later called into question, however, by the findings of a genetic study published by Temple University in 2008. That study found that neither Polynesians nor Micronesians have much genetic relation to Melanesians. The study&#x27;s results suggest that, after ancestors of the Polynesians, having developed sailing outrigger canoes, migrated out of East Asia, they moved quickly through the Melanesian area, mostly without settling there, and instead continued on to areas east of Melanesia, finally settling in those areas.

The genetic evidence suggests that they left few descendants in Melanesia, and therefore probably &quot;only intermixed to a very modest degree with the indigenous populations there&quot;. The study did find a small Austronesian genetic signature (below 20%) in some of the Melanesian groups who speak Austronesian languages, but found no such signature at all in Papuan-speaking groups.

==Languages==
Most of the languages of Melanesia are members of the Austronesian language family or one of the numerous Papuan languages. The term &quot;Papuan languages&quot; refers to their geographical location rather than implying that they are linguistically related. In fact they comprise many separate language families. By one count, there are 1,319 languages in Melanesia, scattered across a small amount of land. On average, there is one language for every 716 square kilometers on the island. This is by far the densest collection of distinct languages on Earth, almost three times as dense as in Nigeria, a country famous for having a very large number of languages in a very compact area.

In addition to the many indigenous Melanesian languages, pidgins and creole languages have developed from trade and cultural interaction within the area and with the wider world. Most notable among these are Tok Pisin and Hiri Motu in Papua New Guinea. They are now both considered distinct creole languages. Use of Tok Pisin is growing. It is sometimes learned as a first language, above all by multi-cultural families. Examples of other Melanesian creoles are Unserdeutsch, Solomon Islands Pijin, Bislama, and Papuan Malay.

==Geography==

A distinction is often made between the island of New Guinea and what is known as Island Melanesia, which consists of &quot;the chain of archipelagos, islands, atolls, and reefs forming the outer bounds of the sheltered oval-shaped coral sea&quot;. This includes the Louisiade Archipelago (a part of Papua New Guinea), the Bismarck Archipelago (a part of Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands), and the Santa Cruz Islands (a part of the country called Solomon Islands). The country of Vanuatu is composed of the New Hebrides island chain (and in the past &#x27;New Hebrides&#x27; has also been the name of the political unit located on the islands). New Caledonia is composed of one large island and several smaller chains, including the Loyalty Islands. The nation of Fiji is composed of two main islands, Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, and smaller islands, including the Lau Islands.

From the geological point of view, the island of New Guinea is part of the Australian continent. New Caledonia is geologically part of Zealandia, and so is Norfolk Island.

The names of islands in Melanesia can be confusing: they have both indigenous and European names. National boundaries sometimes cut across archipelagos. The names of the political units in the region have changed over time, and sometimes have included geographical terms. For example, the island of Makira was once known as San Cristobal, the name given to it by Spanish explorers. It is in the country Solomon Islands, which is a nation-state and not a contiguous archipelago. The border of Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands separates the island of Bougainville from the nearby islands of Choiseul, although Bougainville is geographically part of the chain of islands that includes Choiseul and much of the Solomons.

In addition to the islands mentioned above, there are many smaller islands and atolls in Melanesia. These include:
* Aru Islands, Maluku, Indonesia
* Biak Islands, Papua, Indonesia
* D&#x27;Entrecasteaux Islands, Papua New Guinea
* Kolepom and Komolom Island, South Papua, Indonesia
* Norfolk Island, Australia (geographically only)
* Raja Ampat Islands, Southwest Papua, Indonesia
* Rotuma, Fiji
* Torres Strait Islands, politically divided between Australia and Papua New Guinea
* Trobriand Islands, Papua New Guinea
* Woodlark Island, Papua New Guinea
* Yapen Islands, Papua, Indonesia

Norfolk Island, listed above, has archaeological evidence of East Polynesian rather than Melanesian settlement. Rotuma in Fiji has strong affinities culturally and ethnologically to Polynesia.

==Political geography==
The following countries are considered part of Melanesia:
* 
* 

Melanesia also includes:
* – Western New Guinea: , , , , and 
* – Maluku Islands
* – a sui generis collectivity of France

Several Melanesian states are members of intergovernmental and regional organizations. Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu are members of the Commonwealth of Nations and are also members of the Melanesian Spearhead Group.

==Genetic studies==
Melanesians were found to have a third archaic &quot;Homo&quot; species along with their Denisovan (3–4%) and Neanderthal (2%) ancestors in a genetic admixture with their otherwise modern &quot;Homo sapiens sapiens&quot; genomes.

The frequent occurrence of blond hair among these peoples is due to a specific random mutation, different from the mutation that led to blond hair in peoples indigenous to northern regions of the globe. This is evidence that the genotype and phenotype for blond hair arose at least twice in human history.

<text>Perth is a town in Eastern Ontario, Canada. It is located on the Tay River, southwest of Ottawa, and is the seat of Lanark County.

==History==

The town was established as a military settlement in 1816, shortly after the War of 1812. The settlement of Lanark County began in 1815. In that year &quot;the Settlement forming on the Rideau River&quot; as it was officially referred to (and which soon became known as &quot;Perth Military Settlement&quot;) began to function under Military direction. The settlement was named Perth in honour of acting Governor-General Sir Gordon Drummond, whose ancestral home was Perthshire.

Several townships were surveyed to facilitate the location of farms for military and other settlers; and the site of the future Town of Perth, which had been chosen as the headquarters of the Military Establishment was surveyed in 1816.

Many of the first settlers were military veterans on half pay, while others were military veterans from France, Germany, Poland, Italy, Scotland or Ireland who were offered land in return for their service. The Reverend William Bell, who arrived in June 1817, noted in his diaries that the settlement was more European than the Scottish settlement described to him. The first Scottish settlers came in 1816. Many of the Scottish immigrants were stonemasons; their work can be seen in many area buildings and in the locks of the Rideau Canal.

The military regime lasted until 1824, when settlers were granted municipal rights, i.e., &#x27;the right of self-government&#x27;. For many years Perth was the military, judicial, political and social capital, not only of the County of Lanark, but of the whole of the Ottawa Valley, north and west, until owing to the construction of the Rideau Canal, and the development of the lumber industry further north and west along the Ottawa, it finally was eclipsed by the town called &quot;Bytown&quot;—the present City of Ottawa, the Capital of the Dominion. But for many years the people of the town of Bytown, while it was still &#x27;Bytown&#x27; had to come to Perth for their law and justice, for the law courts of the whole great district were located there.

The first secretary/stores-keeper (and eventually postmaster and superintendent) of the settlement was Daniel Daverne, brought up from the Quarter Masters General Department in Kingston, Ontario, to assume these positions.

Perth is home to a pioneer burial ground, St. Paul&#x27;s United Church Cemetery, formerly The Old Methodist Burying Ground. This cemetery is at the south-east end of the Last Duel Park on Robinson Street. The Craig Street Cemetery, sometimes referred to as the &quot;Old Burying Grounds&quot; also contains many historic graves and saw use from 1820 to 1873.

The town&#x27;s motto is &quot;Pro Rege, Lege et Grege&quot; (&quot;For the King, the Law and the People&quot;), which is shared with the City of Perth in Scotland, and which was adopted in 1980 along with a new crest. The previous motto, &quot;Festina lente sed certo&quot; (&quot;Make haste slowly but surely&quot;), and original town crest appears on the uniforms of the Perth Citizen&#x27;s Band. Founded in 1850, this band continues a tradition of community music with numerous concerts each season.

Near the town is the home of world show jumping champion Ian Millar and Millar Brooke Farm where his great horse Big Ben (1976–1999) is buried. The town has erected a bronze life-sized statue of the horse and Ian Millar, in Stewart Park, across from the Code&#x27;s Mill building.

This town was the site of the last fatal duel in Upper Canada. Robert Lyon, a law student, was killed on June 13, 1833, after fighting over a woman (Elizabeth Hughes) with a former friend, John Wilson. A local park is named &quot;Last Duel Park&quot; to commemorate the event.

In 1893, a cheese known as the &#x27;Mammoth Cheese&#x27; was produced in Perth to be exhibited in Chicago at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition to promote Canadian cheese around the world.

The Links O&#x27;Tay Golf course, walking distance from the downtown core, began its trek through golfing history in 1890 and is was Canada&#x27;s oldest continuously operating golf course until it was bought by Caivan, a suburban subdivision housing developer, in 2021. Caivan proposes to build 1,069 housing units on the golf course land and the company took its use to the Ontario Land Tribunal in 2023.https://engage.perth.ca/caivan There is widespread concern among Perth citizens, and with some town Councillors, about the impact of the development on the small town https://www.insideottawavalley.com/news/one-of-our-primary-goals-all-along-has-been-to-make-sure-that-the-community/article_c9373039-559d-5e3f-b103-bd259409c1e7.html. On February 11 2025, the town entered mediation with Caivan over its plans. The Perth Citizens Band, still giving concerts on the bandstand behind Town Hall, is a tradition dating back over 150 years. The band is Canada&#x27;s oldest active town band. The Perth Citizens Band played &quot;The Maple Leaf Forever&quot; as the Mammoth Cheese departed to the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair in 1893. The bandstand has been behind the Town Hall since it was moved there in 1901 and free summer concerts have taken place there ever since.

Perth is also the site of the first installation of a telephone other than Bell&#x27;s experimental installations. A town dentist, Dr. J. F. Kennedy, a friend of Alexander Graham Bell, installed a direct telephone connection between his home and office. By 1887, there were 19 telephones in Perth, with a switchboard in Dr. Kennedy&#x27;s office.

In 2010, Perth held the historic &quot;Kilt Run&quot; in which 1,067 kilt-clad runners crossed the finish line. The idea to hold a kilt run in Perth was conceived of in October 2009 by Terry Stewart after the Mayor submitted a letter to the &quot;Perth Courier&quot; requesting town residents come up with an idea to help Perth, Scotland celebrate its 800th anniversary. The Perth, Ontario, Kilt Run has since become an annual event. The 2016 Kilt Run attracted 5,000 runners as part of the town&#x27;s 200th anniversary.

==Attractions==
The Tay River splits into two main channels for much of its course through Perth. Much of downtown Perth, including the town hall, is on the island formed by the two channels. During the summer and fall of 2015, the fork in the river was modified to reduce erosion and flooding downstream.

The heritage downtown core of today&#x27;s Perth consists of boutiques, specialty shops, cafés and restaurants, including crafts, antiques and flea markets, and summer Farmers&#x27; and Craft Markets. Most of these operate out of the century-old stone buildings in town. Code&#x27;s Mill began as a tannery in the 1840s and then produced socks and felts until the mid-1900s. It was renovated in 1998 and now features a restaurant, boutique shops and wedding hall. The Perth Museum, situated downtown at the Matheson House, is a historic house constructed in 1840 and is designated as a National Historic Site of Canada.

Erected in 1863, the Perth Town Hall stands out as one of the most impressive municipal buildings in Eastern Ontario. The two-storey structure with cupola-shaped clock tower is constructed from white or cream-coloured freestone (Potsdam sandstone). Throughout the years, the building has housed an auditorium, council chambers, post office, police headquarters, lock-up and municipal offices. Perth&#x27;s downtown area lies within a designated Heritage Conservation District.

Stewart Park, located behind Town Hall, features gardens, bridges, walking paths and treed picnic areas along the Tay River.

An interesting feature of the downtown core is the Crystal Palace, constructed from the discarded remnants of the glass street bus enclosures that used to be on Rideau Street in nearby Ottawa. This structure is located beside the Tay River and can be accessed by both Gore and Drummond Streets. It houses the Perth Farmers&#x27; and Craft Markets on summer Saturdays and is filled with Christmas trees decorated by community groups and schools in November and December. It also houses live music and children&#x27;s activities during the popular Festival of the Maples held in April each year.

==Festivals and events==
Each summer in July, the Stewart Park Music Festival takes place in Stewart Park. It is a popular free festival featuring live music as well as artisan and food vendors.

The Perth Lions Garlic Festival has been celebrating garlic grown in the area each August since 1997. Another festival growing in popularity is the Perth Ribfest Music Festival, which includes kids activities and takes place at Last Duel Park. The Perth Fair, a regional agricultural fair, takes place over the Labour Day weekend; it has been running annually since 1845, one of the oldest in Ontario.

The Festival of Maples is held annually every spring since 1974 and marks the end of the maple syrup harvest, of which Lanark County is known for producing and is dubbed the &#x27;Maple Syrup Capital of Ontario&#x27;. The downtown festival features numerous shops and vendors, maple syrup producers and displays, children&#x27;s entertainment, antique car show and a pancake breakfast. In 2019, the festival was held on April 27.

The Perth Kilt Run normally takes place at the end of June but the 10th anniversary of the Kilt Run was held on August 17, 2019. It holds the Guinness World Record for the world&#x27;s largest kilted run.

The Perth Polar Bear Plunge, held annually on New Years Day since 1994, raises funds for local charities and is known as one of the safest and most successful Polar Bear Plunges in Canada.

==Sports and recreation==
Hockey is very popular in Perth as it has been home to senior and junior teams. Currently, Perth is represented by the Blue Wings in the Eastern Ontario Junior &quot;B&quot; Hockey League. Minor hockey combines Perth and Lanark children with practices and games shared between the Perth and Lanark arenas. Perth was home to a professional baseball team for two years (1936–37) as part of the Canadian–American League. The Perth &amp; District Indoor Pool is home to the Perth Stingrays Aquatic Club, which offers a masters program as well. The Perth United Soccer Club also provides recreational and competitive soccer programs for all ages.

Both high schools in Perth also offer a variety of other sports, such as basketball, football, volleyball, hockey, cross country running, badminton, soccer, curling, golf and track and field.

Conlon Farm Recreation Complex is a 54-acre recreation hub comprising several soccer fields and baseball diamonds and as well tennis courts, basketball courts, beach volleyball courts, skateboard park, pump track, play structures and a splash pad.

The Rideau Trail passes through Perth, which is the base for the Central Section of the Rideau Trail.

<text>Silja Line is a Finnish shipping company and cruiseferry brand owned and operated by the Estonian shipping company AS Tallink Grupp, for car, cargo and passenger traffic between Finland and Sweden.

The former company Silja Oy—today Tallink Silja Oy—is, since 2006, a subsidiary of AS Tallink Grupp, handling marketing and sales for &quot;Tallink&quot; and &quot;Silja Line&quot; brands in Finland as well as managing Tallink Silja&#x27;s ship employees. Another subsidiary, Tallink Silja AB, handles marketing and sales in Sweden. Strategical corporate management is performed by Tallink Grupp which also own the ships.

As of 2009, four ships service two routes under the Silja Line brand, transporting about three million passengers and 200,000 cars every year. The Silja Line ships have a market share of around 50 percent on the two routes served.

The Silja Line logo features the text &quot;Silja Line&quot; and a figure of a seal. Since 2014, the figure of the seal has been smiling. The famous theme tune heard in Silja Line&#x27;s television commercials comes from the tune &quot;Un homme et une femme&quot; (&quot;A man and a woman&quot;) by the French film composer Francis Lai.

== History ==
=== 1904–1957 ===
The history of Silja Line can be traced back to 1904, when two Finnish shipping companies, Finland Steamship Company (, FÅA for short) and Steamship Company Bore, started collaborating on Finland–Sweden traffic. The initial collaboration agreement was terminated in 1909, but re-established in 1910. After World War I in 1918, a new agreement was made that also included the Swedish Rederi AB Svea. Originally the collaboration agreement applied only on service between Turku and Stockholm, but it was also applied to the Helsinki–Stockholm route in 1928. As a precursor to the policies later adopted by Silja Line, each of the three companies ordered a near-identical ship for Helsinki–Stockholm service to coincide with the 1952 Summer Olympics, held in Helsinki. Eventually only Finland SS Co.&#x27;s was ready in time for the Olympics. At this time the city of Helsinki constructed the Olympia Terminal in Helsinki&#x27;s South Harbour, which Silja Line&#x27;s ships still use.

=== 1957–1970 ===
Realising that car-passenger ferries would be the dominant traffic form in the future, the three collaborating companies decided to form a daughter company, &quot;/&quot;. The new company started out with used ships, which were not particularly well-fitted for the role they were meant for, but in 1961 Silja took delivery of the new , the first purpose-built car-passenger ferry in the northern Baltic Sea. &quot;Skandia&quot;″s sister followed the next year and the era&#x27;s giant in 1966. Two more ships based on the &quot;Skandia&quot; design, and , were delivered in 1967 and 1970 respectively.

Despite the establishment of Silja, FÅA, Bore and Svea also continued to operate on the same routes with their own ships. This led to a somewhat complex situation where four different companies were marketed as one entity. In Finland they went by the name (&#x27;Sweden&#x27;s Ships&#x27; or &#x27;Ships to Sweden&#x27;) whereas in Sweden the preferred terms were (roughly &#x27;the ones that sail together&#x27;), (&#x27;Finland&#x27;s Ships&#x27;) or (&#x27;Sweden Ships&#x27;). In both countries the names of all four companies were usually displayed alongside the group identity.

=== 1970–1980 ===
In 1967, three of Silja&#x27;s rival companies had formed a joint marketing and coordination company, Viking Line, which was to become Silja Line&#x27;s main rival for the next two decades. FÅA, Bore and Svea soon realised that a similar arrangement would be preferable to their current fragmented image, and in 1970 a big change was carried out within the organisations: Silja Line was established as a joint marketing and coordination company between FÅA, Bore and Svea, and the ships of Siljavarustamo were divided between these three. All Silja Line ships were painted in the same colour scheme, with a white hull and superstructure, with &quot;Silja Line&quot; and the seal&#x27;s head logo on the side in dark blue. Each company retained their own funnel colours, so it was easy to distinguish which ship belonged to which company even from a distance: Svea&#x27;s funnels were white with a large black &quot;S&quot;, FÅA&#x27;s were black with two white bands, and Bore&#x27;s were yellow with a blue/white cross.

Already before the reorganisation Silja had ordered two new ships from Dubigeon-Normandie S.A. of Nantes to begin year-round service between Helsinki and Stockholm (until then the route was summers only). In 1972, these were delivered to FÅA and Svea as and , respectively. Passenger numbers on the Helsinki route grew fast and already in 1973 it was decided that the three companies would each order a ship of identical design from the same shipyard to replace the current Helsinki–Stockholm ships. These were delivered in 1975, first and &quot;MS Wellamo&quot;, followed by in December. However, winter passenger numbers were insufficient for three ships, and as a result &quot;Bore Star&quot; was chartered to Finnlines during the winters of 1975–76 and 1976–77. In 1976 Finland SS Co changed its name to Effoa (the Finnish phonetic spelling of FÅA). During the latter part of the 1970s Effoa&#x27;s old ferries and cruised the Baltic, Norwegian fjords and the Atlantic (from Málaga) under the marketing name &quot;Silja Cruises&quot;.

=== 1980–1986 ===
In 1979, Svea and Effoa decided again to order new ships for the Helsinki–Stockholm route, which would be the largest ferries of their time. Bore, however, decided not to participate in building new ships, and in 1980 opted to bow out of passenger traffic altogether (Bore Line still exists as a freight-carrying company). Their two ships were sold to Effoa and their shares of Silja Line split between the two other companies. In Finland, and later in Sweden, a large maritime strike in spring 1980 stopped ferry traffic completely and prompted Effoa to terminate the Silja Cruises service.

Despite the difficulties Silja&#x27;s first real cruiseferries, and , entered service in 1981, which led to a 45% raise in passenger numbers. Late in the same year Johnson Line purchased Rederi AB Svea, and the former Svea ships received Johnson Line&#x27;s blue/yellow colours. The good experiences with the new Helsinki ships prompted Effoa and Johnson Line to order two ships built on a similar principle for traffic on the Turku–Stockholm route, which were delivered in 1985 and 1986 as and . Although similar in proportions and interior layout, the new ships sported an attractive streamlined superstructure instead of the box-like superstructure of &quot;Finlandia&quot; and &quot;Silvia Regina&quot;.
=== 1987–1992 ===
1987 was a very eventful year for Silja. Effoa had purchased the famously fast the previous year and from the beginning of 1987 the prestigious but unprofitable &quot;Queen of the Baltic Sea&quot; joined Silja Line&#x27;s fleet. Later in the same year Effoa and Johnson Line jointly purchased Rederi Ab Sally, one of the owners of their rival Viking Line. The other Viking Line partners forced the new owners to sell their share in Viking, but Effoa and Johnson Line retained Vaasanlaivat / Vasabåtarna, Sally Cruises, Sally Ferries UK and Commodore Cruise Line. Although the purchase of Sally had no effect on Silja Line&#x27;s traffic for the time being, it proved to be important later. Finally, 1987 saw another order of new ships for the Helsinki–Stockholm route, which would again be the largest ferries ever built, eventually named and . Not revealed at the time, the new ships had a 140-meter promenade-street running along the center of the ship, a feature never seen before in a ship, but by the first decade of the 21st century commonly found on Royal Caribbean International&#x27;s and Color Line&#x27;s newer ships.

In late 1989, Wärtsilä Marine, the shipyard building Silja&#x27;s new cruiseferries, went bankrupt, which led to the ships being delivered later than had been planned. To ensure the delivery of their ferries Effoa and Johnson Line both purchased a part of the new Masa-Yards established to continue shipbuilding in Wärtsilä&#x27;s former shipyards.

The year 1990 saw the realisation of an old vision: Effoa and Johnson Line merged to form EffJohn. As a result, the seal&#x27;s head logo replaced the colours of each individual owner company on the funnel. In November, the new MS &quot;Silja Serenade&quot; made its maiden voyage from Helsinki to Stockholm, approximately seven months after the original planned delivery date. MS &quot;Silja Symphony&quot; was delivered the following year. Although popular and sporting a successful design, the new ships had been very expensive. This expense, coupled with the depression in the early 1990s, forced EffJohn to cut costs, which resulted in Wasa Line and Sally Cruises being merged into Silja Line in 1992. Also in 1992, &quot;Svea&quot; and &quot;Wellamo&quot; were modernised and renamed &quot;Silja Karneval&quot; and &quot;Silja Festival&quot;, respectively.

=== 1993–2006 ===
The year 1993 began with a bang. In January it was reported that Silja Line had chartered , a ship under construction for Rederi AB Slite, one of the owners of Viking Line. Because of financial troubles Slite could not pay for their new ship, and the shipyard decided to charter it to Silja instead. Later in the same year Silja joined forces with Euroway on their Malmö–Travemünde–Lübeck route. The route proved unprofitable and was terminated in spring 1994.

 was grounded outside Helsinki in spring 1994 and suffered major damage, which prompted Silja to give up traffic on her. September 1994 saw the largest peace-time maritime disaster on the Baltic Sea, the sinking of . &quot;Silja Europa&quot;, &quot;Silja Symphony&quot; and &quot;Finnjet&quot; all assisted in searching for survivors from the disaster. &quot;Silja Festival&quot; was berthed opposite &quot;Estonia&quot; in Tallinn the day before the sinking, but she was in Helsinki when &quot;Estonia&quot; sank and did not come to her assistance. The &quot;Estonia&quot; sinking led to passenger numbers dropping, which did not help Silja&#x27;s precarious financial situation. The company was now the largest on the Baltic Sea, having finally overtaken Viking Line in 1993, but financially it was not doing well. In 1995, Effjohn changed their name to Silja Oy Ab. Three years later the name was changed again, this time to Neptun Maritime.

In 1999, Silja faced two big changes. Tax-free sales ended on routes between EU countries, which forced the Helsinki–Stockholm ships to start calling at Mariehamn in Åland, whose autonomous status within Finland allowed them to stay outside the EU tax union after the country joined the EU in 1994 and so avoid the end of tax-fee sales. A bigger change was Sea Containers purchasing the majority of Neptun Maritime&#x27;s shares. In 2000, the new owners brought one of their Super SeaCats into service on the Helsinki–Tallinn route and Neptun Maritime again changed its name, this time to Silja Oyj Abp. In the same year the route between Vaasa and Umeå was terminated as unprofitable.

By 2004, Sea Containers owned Silja Line entirely. The company was doing well financially and all seemed to be going well. However, Sea Containers&#x27; other operations were not as profitable and in late 2005 they announced their intent to give up their ferry division completely; this naturally including selling Silja Line. In preparation for the sale, the unprofitable &quot;Finnjet&quot; and were taken out of service and transferred under Sea Containers&#x27; ownership. &quot;Silja Serenade&quot; and &quot;Symphony&quot; were also rebuilt in early 2006 to make them more attractive to potential buyers.

=== 2006–present ===
May 2006 saw the sale of Silja Line to the Estonian Tallink. The SuperSeaCats trafficking between Helsinki and Tallinn were not included in the sale as their purchase would have given Tallink a dominant market position on the route, which would have resulted in the competition regulators of Finland and Estonia not approving the sale. As a result, Sea Containers, after barely a year before announcing their intention to give up the ferry business completely, continued operating them under the SuperSeaCat brand. In late 2006 the land organisations of Tallink and Silja Line were reorganised in Finland so that Tallink Finland and Superfast Finland were merged into Oyj Silja Abp, which now took care of all Finnish operations of Tallink/Silja. Shortly afterwards Oyj Silja Abp was renamed into Tallink Silja Oy. Similarly the land organisations in Sweden became Tallink Silja AB.

Tallink stated that it intended to keep the Silja Line brand separated from Tallink. However, most Silja Line marketing in Finland and Sweden has since the takeover been made under the combined Tallink Silja name.

In July 2008, the Tallink ship replaced the &quot;Silja Festival&quot; on the Turku–Mariehamn–Stockholm route. The &quot;Galaxy&quot; was flagged to Sweden and the text Silja Line was painted on her hull sides. The Tallink logo remained on her funnel and the Navitrolla-designed livery of the ship, which differs from the livery of other Silja ships, was not altered. The &quot;Silja Festival&quot;, while remaining registered under the same name, was in turn moved to Tallink&#x27;s Stockholm–Riga route, her funnel repainted in Tallink colours and the text Tallink painted on her sides.

In October 2009, the Managing Director of Silja Line (Tallink Silja Oy), Keijo Mehtonen, retired and Margus Schults was appointed to the post.

In February 2013 switched routes with the , with &quot;Baltic Princess&quot; now placed on the Turku–Stockholm route and &quot;Silja Europa&quot; on Helsinki–Tallinn cruises.

In July 2022, Tallink announced that MS &quot;Galaxy&quot; would be withdrawn in September 2022 from the Turku–Stockholm service for at least seven months. One month later, it was announced that &quot;Galaxy&quot;&#x27;s sister ship on the same route, MS &quot;Baltic Princess&quot;, at the same time would abandon calls at Mariehamn and Stockholm, instead calling at Långnäs and Kapellskär respectively. Tallink states that these changes are temporary and that full service would resume after the market downturn.

== Mascot ==

Harri Hylje is Silja Line&#x27;s seal mascot and the company&#x27;s signature animal appearing in its logo. A living Harri Hylje figure appears on Silja Line ships especially on weekends and on school holiday periods.

=== History ===
The seal logo originated in 1967, allegedly half-accidentally from word play. During a brainstorming meeting among the marketing department, someone said in Swedish: &quot;Who could bring some comfort for a thirsty soul?&quot; The Swedish word for &quot;soul&quot; is &quot;själ&quot;, and in the archipelago it is pronounced similarly to the word for &quot;seal&quot;, which is &quot;säl&quot;. The company name Silja Line had not yet been invented at the time, instead the cooperating shipping companies Bore, Effoa and Svea used the marketing name &quot;Ruotsinlaivat&quot; (&quot;The ships to Sweden&quot;) in Finland and &quot;De Samseglande Finlandsbåtarna&quot; (&quot;The ships to Finland sailing together&quot;) in Sweden.

At first the seal figure in the company&#x27;s advertisements had multiple appearances: it swam along the ships, jumped in the water, sometimes even wore sunglasses and looked different depending on the artist in Finnish and Swedish marketing. At the start of the 1970s, when the marketing name Silja Line was taken into use, the Finnish advertising graphic artist Viktor Kaltala and the Swedish Janne Sjöström spent a day and a half together to come up with a common seal character for the Silja Line Logo. The Silja Line seal logo has since been altered at least in 1972, 2012 and 2014.

In spring 2009 Tallink Silja donated one euro for each Harri Hylje mascot sold on board Silja Line ships to the WWF Finland Baltic Sea campaign &quot;Operaatio Merenneito&quot; (&quot;Operation Mermaid&quot;). The total amount of donations rose up to 11 thousand euro.

In autumn 2014 Tallink Silja, the advertising company Hasan &amp; Partners and the outdoor advertising company JCDecaux produced an interactive advertising campaign based on the Harri Hylje figure at the tram stop outside the Helsinki Central railway station. Citizens could play or take selfies with a remotely controlled Harri Hylje figure shown on a video screen. The device printed gift cards for ferry cruises as a reward.

In 2018 the play equipment manufacturer Lappset produced Harri Hylje themed play ships for the &quot;Silja Serenade&quot; and the &quot;Silja Symphony&quot;.

<text>The Royal Armoured Corps is the armoured arm of the British Army, that together with the Household Cavalry provides its armour capability, with vehicles such as the Challenger 2 and the Warrior tracked armoured vehicle. It includes most of the Army&#x27;s armoured regiments, both the Royal Tank Regiment and those converted from old horse cavalry regiments. In September 2024, it comprised fourteen regiments: ten Regular Regiments; four Army Reserve. Although the Household Cavalry Regiment (the Life Guards and the Blues and Royals) provide an armoured regiment, they are not part of the RAC.

==History==
The RAC was created on 4 April 1939, just before World War II started, by combining regiments from the cavalry of the line which had mechanised with the Royal Tank Corps (renamed Royal Tank Regiment). As the war went on and other regular cavalry and Territorial Army Yeomanry units became mechanised, the corps was enlarged. A significant number of infantry battalions also converted to the armoured role as RAC regiments. In addition, the RAC created its own training and support regiments. Finally, in 1944, the RAC absorbed the regiments of the Reconnaissance Corps.

== Present day ==
=== Regiments ===
The Royal Armoured Corps is divided into regiments which operate main battle tanks (Armour), those in reconnaissance vehicles (Armoured Cavalry), and those in Weapons Mount vehicles (Light Cavalry). Of these, three regiments are designated Dragoon Guards, two as Hussars, one as Lancers and one as Dragoons. The remaining regiment is the Royal Tank Regiment. In the regular army, there are three armoured regiments, three armoured cavalry regiments and three light cavalry regiments. In the army reserve, there is one armoured regiment and three light cavalry regiments.

Being a corps, the RAC is made up of several independent regiments, but the corps does control a few separate units which include:

* Training and Staff
** AFV Training Group
** Regimental Headquarters, Royal Armoured Corps
** The Armour Centre, Bovington Camp
** Royal Armoured Corps Training Regiment, at Allenby Barracks, Bovington Camp
* Regular Army
** 1st The Queen&#x27;s Dragoon Guards (QDG) - Light Cavalry – 7th Infantry Brigade &amp; Headquarters East
** The Royal Scots Dragoon Guards (Carabiniers and Greys) (SCOTS DG) - Light Cavalry – 51st Infantry Brigade &amp; Headquarters Scotland
** The Royal Dragoon Guards (RDG) - Armoured Cavalry – 20th Armoured Brigade
** The Queen&#x27;s Royal Hussars (The Queen&#x27;s Own and Royal Irish) (QRH) – Armour – 20th Armoured Brigade Combat Team
** The Royal Lancers (Queen Elizabeths&#x27; Own) (RL) - Armoured Cavalry – 1st Armoured Infantry Brigade
** The King&#x27;s Royal Hussars (KRH) – Armour – 12th Armoured Infantry Brigade
** The Light Dragoons (LD) - Light Cavalry – 4th Infantry Brigade &amp; Headquarters North East
** Royal Tank Regiment2 (RTR) – Armour – 12th Armoured Brigade Combat Team

A Royal Tank Regiment CBRN reconnaissance and survey squadron forms part of 28 Engineer Regiment (C-CBRN), Royal Engineers

*Army Reserve - Yeomanry
**The Royal Yeomanry (RY) - Light Cavalry – 7th Infantry Brigade &amp; Headquarters East
**The Queen&#x27;s Own Yeomanry (QOY) - Light Cavalry – 4th Infantry Brigade &amp; Headquarters North East
**Scottish and North Irish Yeomanry (SNIY) - Light Cavalry – 51st Infantry Brigade &amp; Headquarters Scotland
**The Royal Wessex Yeomanry (RWxY) - Armour – 3rd (United Kingdom) Division

A system of pairing exists in the British Army of Regular to Reserve unit. Through this, operational and training cycles are aligned, resources shared and strategic depth enabled. In the Royal Armoured Corps this manifests with each yeomanry unit being paired with a regular unit of the same role.

===Basing===

*Tidworth - Kings Royal Hussars; Royal Tank Regiment, The Queen&#x27;s Royal Hussars (The Queen&#x27;s Own and Royal Irish)
*Catterick - The Royal Lancers; The Light Dragoons
*Battlesbury Barracks, Warminster - The Royal Dragoon Guards
*Swanton Morley - 1st The Queen&#x27;s Dragoon Guards
*Leuchars - The Royal Scots Dragoon Guards (Carabiniers and Greys)
*London &amp; Midlands - Royal Yeomanry
*South of England - Royal Wessex Yeomanry
*North of England - Queen&#x27;s Own Yeomanry
*Scotland &amp; Northern Ireland - Scottish and North Irish Yeomanry

====Band====
The Band of the Royal Armoured Corps was the single band representing the RAC provided by of the Royal Corps of Army Music. This was formed in 2014 by the amalgamation of the Heavy Cavalry and Cambrai Band, and the Light Cavalry Band. The Band of the Royal Armoured Corps is stationed at Catterick. However, as part of the 2019 reorganisation of the CAMUS, the band was merged into British Army Band Catterick.

==Reorganisations==

===Delivering Security in a Changing World (2004)===
The reorganisation of the Army announced in 2004 led to significant changes to the Royal Armoured Corps. Reorganisation that began in 2003 would see three armoured regiments removed from Germany to the UK, with one re-roled as an FR regiment. In addition, three Challenger 2 squadrons will be converted to &quot;Interim Medium Armour Squadrons&quot;, while each FR regiment will gain a Command and Support Squadron.

As part of the reorganisation, postings will be realigned:
*UK based regiments
**Catterick: Armoured Regiment (RDG) (1 Armoured Infantry Brigade), Formation Reconnaissance Regiment (QRL) (1 Armoured Infantry Brigade)
**Tidworth: 2 x Armoured Regiment (2RTR, KRH), (1st Mechanized Brigade, 12th Mechanized Brigade,)
**Swanton Morley: Formation Reconnaissance Regiment (LD) (Theatre Troops)
**Warminster: Training/Demonstration squadron (A Squadron, RTR)
**Honington: Armoured Regiment (1RTR)
**Bovington: HQ RAC

*Germany based regiments
**Sennelager: Armoured Regiment (QRH), Formation Reconnaissance Regiment QDG (20 Armoured Brigade)

===Strategic Defence and Security Review (2010)/Army 2020===
In 2012, following the Strategic Defence and Security Review of 2010, specific proposals about the make up of the future British Army were announced under the title &quot;Army 2020&quot;. These proposals were intended to reduce the size of the army to around 82,000. The Royal Armoured Corps was to be reduced by a total of two regiments, with the 9th/12th Royal Lancers amalgamated with the Queen&#x27;s Royal Lancers to form a single lancer regiment, the Royal Lancers, and the 1st and 2nd Royal Tank Regiments joined to form a single Royal Tank Regiment.

The Royal Armoured Corps will also see a shift with one third of its regiments operating as armoured regiments with main battle tanks, another third as formation reconnaissance regiments and a final third as light cavalry using Jackal vehicles. Armoured regiments would consist of Type 56 regiments, each with three Sabre Squadrons (comprising 18 Challenger 2 Tanks each) and a command and recce squadron. Armoured Cavalry or formation reconnaissance regiments would also have a command and recce squadron and three Sabre Squadrons; which will initially be equipped with Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked), and then with Future Rapid Effect System Scout vehicles. Jackal regiments will be part of the Adaptable Force, comprising three Sabre Squadrons (each with 16 vehicles). These regiments will be paired with a Yeomanry regiment.

The new structure of the Reaction Force will see three armoured regiments, each assigned to a new &quot;Armoured Infantry Brigade&quot;, alongside a formation reconnaissance regiment (renamed as &quot;armoured cavalry&quot;), two armoured infantry battalions and a heavy protected mobility battalion. These six regiments will fall operationally under what will become known as the &quot;reaction forces&quot;, which will be the army&#x27;s high readiness force. The remaining three regiments will be located with the remainder of the regular army under what has been term the &quot;adaptable forces&quot;, which will provide a pool of resources to back up operations conducted by the &quot;reaction forces&quot;.

This new basing plan on 5 March 2013 gave an overview of where the regiments will be based. All RAC regiments will be UK based, with the 1st The Queen&#x27;s Dragoon Guards moving to Swanton Morley, The Royal Scots Dragoon Guards moving to the Leuchars area, the Queen&#x27;s Royal Hussars to Tidworth, the Royal Lancers settling in Catterick, the Light Dragoons in Catterick, and the Royal Tank Regiment to Tidworth. The expected Army 2020 layout for the RAC is to be:

===Future Soldier (2021)===
In November 2021, the UK Government published &quot;Future Soldier&quot;, the planned reform of the British Army following its integrated defence and security review. Part of this would see a reorganisation of the regiments of the Royal Armoured Corps.

====1st (United Kingdom) Division====
1st (UK) Division is planned as the UK&#x27;s primary land element for operations outside the European theatre, as well as operations supporting NATO&#x27;s flanks. It consists of four infantry-centered brigades - two of these will contain regular light cavalry regiments, while a third serves as a parent formation for units of the Army Reserve.
*4th Light Brigade Combat Team
**The Light Dragoons (Light Cavalry)
*7th Light Mechanised Brigade Combat Team
**The Royal Scots Dragoon Guards (Carabiniers and Greys) (Light Cavalry)
*19th Brigade
**The Scottish and North Irish Yeomanry (Army Reserve)
**The Queen&#x27;s Own Yeomanry (Army Reserve)
====3rd (United Kingdom) Division====
3rd (UK) Division is planned as the UK&#x27;s main reaction force, intended to act as a lead formation alongside NATO, and primarily consists of a pair of armoured brigades containing the army&#x27;s armoured and armoured cavalry units, and a third brigade containing the remainder of the army&#x27;s armoured cavalry units tasked primarily with reconnaissance.
*12th Armoured Brigade Combat Team
**The Royal Tank Regiment (Armoured)
**The King&#x27;s Royal Hussars (Armoured Cavalry)
**The Royal Wessex Yeomanry (Army Reserve)
*20th Armoured Brigade Combat Team
**The Queen&#x27;s Royal Hussars (Queen&#x27;s Own and Royal Irish) (Armoured)
**The Royal Dragoon Guards (Armoured Cavalry)
*1st Deep Reconnaissance Strike Brigade Combat Team
**Household Cavalry Regiment (Armoured Cavalry)
**The Royal Lancers (Queen Elizabeths&#x27; Own) (Armoured Cavalry)
**1st The Queen&#x27;s Dragoon Guards (Light Cavalry)
**The Royal Yeomanry (Army Reserve)

<text>The Royal Regiment of Artillery, commonly referred to as the Royal Artillery (RA) and colloquially known as &quot;The Gunners&quot;, is one of two regiments that make up the artillery arm of the British Army. The Royal Regiment of Artillery comprises thirteen Regular Army regiments, the King&#x27;s Troop Royal Horse Artillery and five Army Reserve regiments.
==History==
===Formation to 1799===
Artillery was used by the English army as early as the Battle of Crécy in 1346, while Henry VIII established it as a semi-permanent function in the 16th century. Until the early 18th century, the majority of British regiments were raised for specific campaigns and disbanded on completion. An exception were gunners based at the Tower of London, Portsmouth and other forts around Britain, who were controlled by the Ordnance Office and stored and maintained equipment and provided personnel for field artillery &#x27;traynes&#x27; that were organised as needed.

These personnel, responsible in peacetime for maintaining the forts with their &quot;garrison artillery&quot; (or coastal artillery), were the first regular artillerymen, organised in 1540 under the Master-General and Board of Ordnance, but paid directly by the Exchequer. The regular artillerymen of the District Establishments were responsible for upkeep of the fort and maintenance of equipment, and would be brought up to strength in wartime with untrained personnel drafted in from the British Army or the Militia. The post of &quot;Captain of Fort&quot; was replaced (at least in England, if not in its colonies) with that of &quot;Governor&quot; following the Restoration. When Marlborough was restored as Master-General of the Ordnance in 1714, he initiated a series of reforms, which included splitting the existing Ordnance Service into artillery and sappers or engineers. The artillery were formed into two marching companies, each of 100 men, in 1716.

These marching companies were renamed the &quot;Royal Artillery&quot; in 1720. These were increased to four companies and on 1 April 1722 grouped with independent artillery units at Gibraltar and Menorca to form the Royal Regiment of Artillery; the first commander was Colonel Albert Borgard, a Dane who served in the British army since 1698.

Aside from the Master Gunner of England, the detachments in each fort formed a &quot;District Establishment&quot; that included a &quot;Captain of Fort&quot;, a Master-Gunner or Chief-Gunner, and a number of other ranks, including Gunners, Gunner&#x27;s Mates, Quarter-Gunners, and Matroses. Their numbers were extremely small; as late as 1720, the total establishment for the whole of Britain was 41 master gunners and 178 gunner assistants. Although the Royal Artillery increasingly involved itself with the coastal artillery in Britain, also, the District Establishments remained independent until February 1771, when the Royal Artillery formed eight Invalid Companies (made up of personnel no longer fit for expeditionary service) into which they were absorbed (although the District Establishments would still rely on drafts of sailors, British Army soldiers, Militia infantrymen, or Volunteers to bring the batteries up to wartime strength until the formation of Militia Artillery and Volunteer Artillery in the 1850s).

During the 18th century, the British regular military forces, including the Board of Ordnance&#x27;s military corps (the Royal Artillery, Royal Engineers and later the Royal Sappers and Miners) and the British Army (composed mostly of infantry and cavalry) became increasingly professional (various reserve, or &quot;local&quot;, forces also existed, including: the Militia, or old Constitutional Force, normally made up of infantry units; the mounted Yeomanry; and Volunteer units of various types, normally raised only during wartime), particularly in the fields of artillery and engineering; Britain lagged behind others in this area, with Vauban establishing the French &quot;Corps royal des ingénieurs militaires&quot; as far back as 1690.
A cadet company was formed at the Royal Military Academy or RMA Woolwich in 1741; this trained artillery and engineering officers for the regiment, the East India Company and the Royal Irish Artillery. In 1757, it split into two battalions, each of twelve companies; by 1780, it contained 32 companies in four battalions, two &quot;invalid companies&quot; used solely for garrison duties and the Royal Artillery Band, with a total strength of 5,241 men and officers.

Originally based in the Royal Arsenal, beginning in 1770 the regiment was rehoused in the Royal Artillery Barracks on Woolwich Common. A major innovation in 1793 was the establishment of the Royal Horse Artillery, designed to provide mobile fire support for cavalry units. The same year saw the foundation of the Corps of Royal Artillery Drivers to provide transport for the artillery.

Fixed Coastal Artillery batteries were generally manned in peacetime by a handful of Royal Artillery personnel primarily responsible for maintenance, who were reinforced in wartime by drafts of infantrymen from the British Army or the Militia, or by temporarily-raised Volunteer Artillery corps. This was to remain the case through the Naploeonic Wars.

===1800–1899===
The regiment was involved in all major campaigns of the Napoleonic Wars; in 1804, naval artillery was transferred to the Royal Marine Artillery, while the Royal Irish Artillery lost its separate status in 1810 after the 1800 Union. This period also saw development of the Congreve rocket; based on an existing Indian design, these were the first solid-fuel projectiles used by the British army and two rocket troops were established in 1814. Their use in the War of 1812 is referenced in the line &quot;rocket&#x27;s red glare&quot; which appears in the Star-Spangled Banner.
The Militia, which had been a paper tiger since the end of the Napoleonic Wars, was re-organised under the Militia Act 1852 in response to the threat of invasion by France, changing it from a conscripted force to one made up of volunteers who engaged for terms of service. The force continued to be a reserve tasked with home defence, embodied for annual training, and for the duration of wars or emergencies. The Militia had been principally an infantry force to this date, but Militia Artillery units were added from this point, and some existing Militia Infantry regiments were converted to coastal artillery. The role of the Militia Artillery was to man coastal defences and fortifications in wartime, relieving the Royal Artillery (RA) for active service.

The Royal Artillery (and also of the Royal Engineers, Royal Sappers and Miners, the Commissariat Department, and various barracks, ordnance stores, and transport departments) was transferred to the British Army when the Board of Ordnance was abolished in 1855 (the administrative branches of the Board were absorbed by the War Office) and the War Office School of Gunnery established in Shoeburyness in 1859. When the British East India Company was dissolved in 1862, its artillery function was absorbed by the Royal Artillery, giving it a total strength of 29 horse batteries, 73 field batteries and 88 heavy batteries. Military expenditure estimates for 1872 list the regimental strength as a total of 34,943 men and officers, including those in India.

Although the Militia and the Volunteer Force remained separate forces, during the latter half of the Nineteenth Century they were re-organised through a succession of reforms, and increasingly integrated with the British Army. In 1882, the Militia Artillery units lost their individual identities, becoming numbered brigades organised within Royal Artillery territorial divisions (two brigades of horse artillery, four brigades of field artillery and eleven territorial divisions of garrison artillery). In 1889 the number of divisions was reduced to three, and the Militia Artillery brigades were renamed again, mostly regaining some variation of their original territorial names.

Post 1881, militia artillery officers wore for a brief time five button serge foreign service frocks with ball buttons and silver lace. Post 1890, officers transitioned to pocketed examples, again with ball buttons but the frocks varying from pure blue serge to other examples with scarlet facings.

Prior to 1882, each Militia Artillery unit in the United Kingdom wore a unique badge. Between 1882 and 1889, Militia Artillery brigades wore a divisional badge based on that of the Royal Artillery, except that the lower scroll and upper scroll, which on the Royal Artillery badge were inscribed &quot;Quo Fas Et Gloria Ducunt&quot; and &quot;Ubique&quot; (which indicated the regular Royal Artillery, like the Royal Engineers, served everywhere), were respectively inscribed with the name of the territorial division name (by example, North Irish Division) and left blank or covered in a spray of laurel (as the Militia and Volunteer Force were both home defence forces, the members of which could not be sent abroad on expedition without their consents). From 1889 to 1902, the lower scroll was inscribed with the name of the unit (by example, Antrim Artillery) and the upper scroll left blank or covered in a spray of laurel. Grenade badges, whether worn as a collar badge or elsewhere, lacked the scroll inscribed &quot;Ubique&quot; that was part of the regular Royal Artillery version. Militia Artillery units were made up of Militia officers and other ranks, with a Permanent Staff made up of seconded Royal Artillery officers and senior other ranks, including a single officer acting as both Commandant and Adjutant (where a suitably qualified Militia officer was unavailable to serve as Commandant), or only as Adjutant where the Commandant was a Militia officer.

Units from the Royal Engineers and Royal Artillery were in Australia, even after Federation.

===1900 to present day===

On 1 July 1899, the Royal Artillery was divided into three groups: the Royal Horse Artillery of 21 batteries and the Royal Field Artillery of 95 batteries composed one group, while the coastal defence, mountain, siege and heavy batteries were split off into another group named the Royal Garrison Artillery of 91 companies. The third group continued to be titled simply &quot;Royal Artillery&quot;, and was responsible for ammunition storage and supply. Which branch a gunner belonged to was indicated by metal shoulder titles (R.A., R.F.A., R.H.A., or R.G.A.). The RFA and RHA also dressed as mounted men, whereas the RGA dressed like foot soldiers. In 1920 the rank of Bombardier was instituted in the Royal Artillery.

Following the separation of the regular garrison companies into the Royal Garrison Artillery in 1899, the Militia Artillery units were re-titled accordingly in 1902 (by example, &quot;The Antrim Royal Garrison Artillery (Militia)&quot;, which would usually be rendered &quot;Antrim R.G.A (M)&quot;). The badge adopted was the same as that of the regular Royal Regiment of Artillery, from that point including the &quot;ubique&quot; and &quot;Quo Fas Et Gloria Ducunt&quot; scrolls, with a letter &quot;M&quot; fixed at the bottom of the gun badge, and on the body of the grenade on the grenade badge (also with the &quot;ubique&quot; scroll), whether worn on the collar or on a cap. Alternately, Ubique was replaced on scrolls with the name of the city, county or colony for which the unit was named.

When the Volunteer Force and the Yeomanry in the United Kingdom (including the Volunteer Artillery) were merged to create the Territorial Force in 1908, the Militia was re-designated the Special Reserve. At the same time, plans were made to convert all of the Royal Garrison Artillery (Militia) units to Special Reserve Royal Field Artillery, but all Home units other than The Antrim Royal Garrison Artillery (Militia) (converted in 1956 to &quot;74 (Antrim Artillery) Engineer Regiment (V)&quot;) were instead disbanded in 1909 (although Militia Artillery units remained in some of the colonies, and these were not re-designated as Special Reserve; The most notable of these was the Bermuda Militia Artillery, which, like the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps, formed part of the garrison of the important Imperial fortress colony of Bermuda where the regular Royal Artillery had first posted a company in 1794, following the French Revolution). The remainder of the Special Reserve was re-designated as the Militia again after the First World War and permanently suspended. The Territorial Force was renamed the Territorial Army.

The division of the Royal Regiment of Artillery lasted until 1924, when the RFA, RHA, and RGA amalgamated once more to become one regiment. In 1938, RA Brigades were renamed regiments. During the World War II there were over 1 million men serving in 960 gunner regiments. In 1947 the Riding Troop RHA was renamed the King&#x27;s Troop Royal Horse Artillery and, in 1951, the title of the regiment&#x27;s colonel-in-chief became Captain General. When The Queen first visited the Troop after her accession, it was expected that it would become &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Troop&quot;, but Her Majesty announced that in honour of her father&#x27;s decision it would remain &quot;The King&#x27;s Troop&quot;.

The Royal Horse Artillery, which has separate traditions, uniforms and insignia, still retains a distinct identity within the regiment.

Before World War II, Royal Artillery recruits were required to be at least tall. Men in mechanised units had to be at least tall. They initially enlisted for six years with the colours and a further six years with the reserve or four years and eight years. They trained at the Royal Artillery Depot in Woolwich.

From its beginnings, the Royal Artillery has been based at Woolwich, in south-east London. In 2003 it was decided to move the headquarters to Larkhill in the Salisbury Plain Training Area in Wiltshire (the RA&#x27;s training ground, where the Royal School of Artillery has been based since 1915). In 2012, however, the King&#x27;s Troop, Royal Horse Artillery was relocated to Woolwich from their former headquarters in St John&#x27;s Wood.

==The Royal Artillery today==
The Royal Artillery is equipped with a variety of equipment and performs a wide range of roles, including:
* Surveillance and target acquisition/unmanned air systems
* Commando and airborne artillery
* Self-propelled artillery
* Multiple launch rocket systems
* Air defence
The Captain General of the regiment is King Charles III. The post was previously known as Colonel-in-Chief until King George VI expressed the desire to be known as Captain General. The head of the regiment is the Master Gunner, St. James&#x27;s Park.

The Royal Regiment of Artillery comprises both Regular (full-time) and Reserve (part-time) units. The Royal Regiment of Artillery is unusual in that it has sub-units that often move between regiments, or are placed into suspended animation. See List of Royal Artillery Batteries.

<doc id="83402" wikidata="Q2025514" url="?curid=83402" title="Infantry of the British Army">
<text>The Infantry of the British Army comprises 49 infantry battalions, from 19 regiments. Of these, 33 battalions are part of the Regular army and the remaining 16 a part of the Army Reserve. The British Army&#x27;s Infantry takes on a variety of roles, including armoured, mechanised, air assault and light.

==Recruitment and training==
===Recruitment===

Traditionally, regiments that form the combat arms of the British Army (cavalry and infantry) recruit from specific areas of the country. Infantry regiments had been assigned specific areas from which they would recruit from by the mid eighteenth century. These were formalised under the Cardwell Reforms that began in the 1860s. Under this scheme, single battalion infantry regiments were amalgamated into two battalion regiments, then assigned to a depot and associated recruiting area (which would usually correspond to all or part of a county). The recruiting area (usually) would then become part of the regiment&#x27;s title. It was this that gave rise to the concept of the &quot;county regiment&quot;, with the local infantry regiment becoming part of the fabric of its local area.

Over time, regiments have been amalgamated further, which has led to recruiting areas of individual regiments increasing in size. Often, these amalgamations have been between regiments whose recruiting areas border each other. However, there have been occasions where regiments of a similar type, but from widely different areas, have been amalgamated. Two modern examples have been the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers (amalgamated from the county regiments of Northumberland, Warwickshire, City of London and Lancashire, all of which were regiments of fusiliers) and The Light Infantry (amalgamated from the county regiments of Cornwall, Somerset, Shropshire, South Yorkshire and Durham, all of which were regiments of light infantry).

Since September 2007, when the most recent reforms were completed, the infantry has consisted of 18 separate regiments. The five regiments of foot guards recruit from their respective home nations (with the exception of the Coldstream Guards, which recruits from the counties through which the regiment marched between Coldstream and London). Scotland, Ireland and Wales each have a single regiment of line infantry from which they recruit (though the battalions of the Royal Regiment of Scotland recruit from the areas they recruited from when they were separate regiments), while England has seven line infantry and rifles regiments. The Parachute Regiment recruits nationally, while the Royal Gurkha Rifles recruits most of its serving personnel from Nepal, and the Royal Gibraltar Regiment recruits from the UK and Commonwealth nations

Before the Second World War, infantry recruits were required to be at least tall. They initially enlisted for seven years with the colours and a further five years with the reserve. They trained at their own regimental depot.

===Training===
Unlike the other trades in the army, which have separate units for basic training and specialised training, new recruits into the infantry undergo a single course at the Infantry Training Centre Catterick. This course, called the &quot;Combat Infantryman&#x27;s Course&quot; (CIC), lasts 26 weeks as standard and teaches recruits both the basics of soldiering (Phase 1 training) and the specifics of soldiering in the infantry (Phase 2 training). On completion of the CIC, the newly qualified infantry soldier will then be posted to his battalion.

For some infantry units, the CIC is longer, due to specific additional requirements for individual regiments:
*The Foot Guards CIC has an additional two-week enhanced drill course.
*The Parachute Regiment CIC has an additional two-week Pre-Parachute Selection (PPS) course.
*The Brigade of Gurkhas CIC combines the Common Military Syllabus with the CIC, together with courses on British culture and the English Language. The Gurkha CIC lasts 37 weeks.

Officers receive their initial training at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, infantry officers then undertake the Platoon Commander&#x27;s Battle Course, which is run at the Infantry Battle School at Brecon in Wales. It is here that leadership and tactics are taught to new platoon commanders. New NCOs and Warrant Officers are also sent on courses at Brecon when they come up for promotion. This encompasses Phase 3 training. Phase 3 training is also undertaken at the Support Weapons School at Warminster, where new officers, NCOs and soldiers are trained in the use of support weapons (mortars, anti-tank weapons) and in communications.

Reservist Infantrymen undertake preliminary training at Regional Training Centres prior to attending a two-week CIC (Reserve) at Catterick.

===Headquarters Infantry===
Headquarters Infantry, which is located at Waterloo Lines on Imber Road in Warminster, is responsible for recruiting, manning and training policy of the Infantry. Headquarters Infantry was established in 1991 as a result of the Options for Change reform.

==Divisions of infantry==
The infantry in the British Army is divided for administrative purposes into divisions. These are not the same as the ready and regenerative divisions (see below), but are based on either the geographical recruiting areas of the regiments, or the type of regiments:
*The Guards and Parachute Division has the regiments of Foot Guards plus the Parachute Regiment.
*The Union Division has the infantry regiments from Scotland, Wales and Ireland, plus one from England.
*The Queen&#x27;s Division has the regiments from England, as well as Gibraltar.
*The Light Division has the two remaining regiments of rifles and Gurkha Rifles.

Each division, in addition to the regiments under its administrative control, also hosts a battalion of The Rangers, the newly formed special operations unit.

The four existing divisions were formed as a result of the &quot;Future Soldier&quot; reforms announced in 2021; prior to this, only the Queen&#x27;s Division of the new formations existed. The Guards Division, Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division and King&#x27;s Division were the other three formations, while a number of other regiments sat outside the divisional structure.

==Types of infantry==

===Operations===
Within the British Army, there are six main types of infantry:
*Armoured Infantry – armoured infantry are equipped with the Warrior Infantry Fighting Vehicle, a tracked vehicle that can deploy over all terrain.
*Mechanised Infantry – mechanised infantry (or &quot;protected mobility infantry) are equipped with wheeled armoured vehicles for transporting troops. This is divided into &quot;heavy protected mobility infantry&quot; (with large vehicles such as Mastiff), and &quot;light protected mobility infantry&quot; (with smaller vehicles such as Foxhound).
*Light Infantry – light infantry are not equipped with armoured vehicles; such units may specialise in jungle and/or arctic warfare
*Air Assault Infantry – air assault infantry are trained to be deployed using helicopters, parachute or aircraft.
*Specialised Infantry – infantry configured to undertake training, mentoring and assistance to indigenous forces in partner nations.
*Public duties – infantry on public duties are essentially light infantry units undertaking primarily ceremonial tasks.

===Traditions===
The infantry is traditionally divided into three types:
*Foot Guards – foot guards are those infantry regiments that were formed specifically to provide close guard to the monarch. Soldiers in the guards were usually the best trained and equipped members of the infantry. However, they would fight in the same way as ordinary regiments.
*Line Infantry – line infantry refers to those regiments that historically fought in linear formations, unlike light troops, who fought in loose order. The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw expansion of the roles of the infantry. To this end, the companies stationed on each flank of an infantry battalion were specialist units, with a company of light infantry trained as skirmishers to operate independently on the battlefield, and a company of grenadiers, who were usually the biggest and strongest men in the battalion, operating as the lead assault troops. In later years, the British Army raised full line infantry regiments classed as light infantry, who operated with muskets alongside specialised regiments armed with rifles.
*Rifles – in the late eighteenth century, the development of the Baker rifle led to the commissioning by the British Army of regiments specially trained to use the new weapon. These regiments would operate as skirmishers and sharpshooters on the edges of the field of battle. These regiments wore green rather than red tunics to enable them to blend in more with the environment, thus giving them the nickname &quot;green jackets&quot;.

The tactical distinctions between infantry regiments disappeared in the late nineteenth century, but remain in tradition. In the order of precedence, the five regiments of foot guards are ranked above the ten regiments of traditional line infantry, who are ranked above the two remaining regiments of rifles.

==Divisions and brigades==
Under the Future Soldier reforms announced in 2021, the British Army will have a total of 31 regular infantry battalions, 16 reserve infantry battalions and nine independent companies performing a variety of tasks. Under the Future Soldier plan, postings are:

===1st (United Kingdom) Division===
1st (UK) Division is planned as the UK&#x27;s primary land element for operations outside the European theatre, as well as operations supporting NATO&#x27;s flanks. It consists of four infantry centred brigades – one is intended as a high-readiness mobile formation, one as a light infantry formation to provide surge capacity, and one as a parent formation for Army Reserve battalions. The other, 16 Air Assault Brigade, forms part of the overall &quot;Reaction Force&quot;, and is a lead element of the UK&#x27;s rapid reaction strategy. The other major independent element of the Reaction Force is UK Commando Force; although this does have British Army units attached in combat support roles, the infantry units are from the Royal Marines, which is part of the Naval Service.

===Notes===
==History==
===Brigade system, large regiments, disbandings and amalgamations===
Following the end of the Second World War, reductions in the size of the infantry led to the amalgamation of the existing regimental depots, together with their operational battalions, into geographically based infantry depots, each designated by a letter of the alphabet from A to O (not including I). In 1948, upon the further reduction of line infantry and rifle regiments to a single battalion, the 14 infantry depots were renamed as geographical brigades (with the exception of Depot J, which was the brigade for those regiments designated as &quot;light infantry&quot;, and Depot O, which was for the two regiments of rifles ). These brigades assumed the administrative functions from the individual regimental depots, essentially forming what amounted to a multi-battalion regiment. This was taken a stage further following the 1957 Defence White Paper, when each brigade adopted a single cap badge that would be worn by all of the regiments under its administration. This led to discussions within the government regarding the flexibility of the infantry under the then present regimental system, as well as the difficulty of potentially making reductions to the size of the army owing to the emotive nature of the amalgamation of regiments into single battalions. This led to the concept of the &quot;large regiment&quot;, which would use the existing brigades as the basis of new, multi-battalion infantry regiments, amalgamating the existing single-battalion regiments en masse, with each of them becoming a battalion of the new formation. This process had to a certain degree begun in the East Anglian and Green Jackets Brigades, which had redesignated the regiments they were responsible for from their old names to numbered designations. These two became the first large regiments as the Royal Anglian Regiment and Royal Green Jackets in 1964 and 1966 respectively. Four further large regiments (The Queen&#x27;s Regiment, Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, Royal Irish Rangers and Light Infantry) were formed between 1966 and 1968, before the process was halted – the brigade system was abolished, with instead all of the remaining infantry regiments grouped into six administrative divisions.

The amalgamations into large regiments coincided with a planned reduction in the size of the infantry – the intention was that the junior battalion of each large regiment or brigade (prior to the implementation of the divisional structure) would be removed, whether by amalgamation or disbanding. This saw plans for the creation of four new single battalion infantry regiments:
*Royal Regiment of Wales – South Wales Borderers and Welch Regiment
*Queen&#x27;s Lancashire Regiment – Lancashire Regiment and Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire)
*Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment (29th/45th Foot) – Worcestershire Regiment and Sherwood Foresters
*Royal Regiment of Gloucestershire and Hampshire – Gloucestershire Regiment and Royal Hampshire Regiment

At the same time, three more single battalion regiments elected to disband rather than amalgamate:
*The Cameronians (Scottish Rifles)
*York and Lancaster Regiment
*Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise&#x27;s)

Three of the regimental amalgamations, two of the regimental disbandments, plus another three of the planned disbandings of large regiment battalions, took place between 1968 and 1970. However, the 1970 General Election saw a change of administration, with the new Conservative government electing to review the plans. The outcome of this saw the planned amalgamation of the Gloucestershire Regiment and Royal Hampshire Regiment rescinded, together with plans to disband another four infantry battalions completely. Instead, six battalions were reduced in size to a single company:
*2nd Battalion, Scots Guards (2nd Battalion Company)
*1st Battalion, Royal Hampshire Regiment (Minden Company)
*1st Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Balaklava Company)
*4th Battalion, Queen&#x27;s Regiment (Albuhera Company)
*4th Battalion, Royal Anglian Regiment (Tiger Company)
*3rd Battalion, Royal Green Jackets (R Company)

The battalions of the Scots Guards, Royal Hampshire Regiment, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, and Royal Green Jackets were subsequently reconstituted.

===Delivering Security in a Changing World (2003)===

HM Treasury asked for major cuts in the strength of the infantry in 2003, with at least ten battalions to be disbanded. This proved so unacceptable that, in November 2003, there was consideration to instead reducing each battalion to two rifle companies (with the third to come from the TA). By March 2004, ECAB had shown that the maximum number of battalions it was possible to cut was four. This was finally officially announced as part of the army re-organisation. The arms plot system would be abolished; instead, individual battalions would be given fixed roles. To ensure that officers and men could continue to gain the variety of skills that the arms plot provided, the restructuring would also see a series of amalgamations of the remaining single battalion infantry regiments into large regiments. In addition, the regular army will lose four battalions. The roles are divided up as follows:
*Armoured Infantry – 8 battalions (including Land Warfare Training Battalion)
*Mechanised Infantry – 3 battalions
*Light Role Infantry (including public duties and Gurkhas) – 20 battalions
*Air Assault Infantry – 4 battalions
*Commando Infantry – 1 battalion
*Territorial Army Infantry – 14 battalions

The reorganisation was a hybrid of the systems used to organise the regular infantry in Australia and Canada. Australia&#x27;s regular infantry encompasses eight battalions in a single large regiment, the Royal Australian Regiment – this system is the one undertaken by the Scottish Division and the Light Division. Canada&#x27;s regular infantry has three regiments, each of three battalions, which is how the King&#x27;s Division and the Prince of Wales&#x27; Division will be restructured (albeit with one regiment of three battalions and one of two battalions each).

In addition to the army&#x27;s infantry battalions, there are three further battalion-sized commando infantry units, which are part of the Royal Marines, as well as eight field squadrons (each larger than an infantry company) of the RAF Regiment, who have responsibility for the ground defence of air assets and are under the control of the Royal Air Force.

The majority of infantry battalions are attached to one of the deployable brigades. However, there are a number of formations that exist to administer those infantry battalions that are not assigned to deployable brigades, but are instead available for independent deployment on roulement tours.

====Guards Division====
Each battalion in the five single battalion regiments of the Guards Division has a fixed role:
*Armoured Infantry (1 SG) – 1
*Light Role/Public Duties (1 GREN GDS, 1 COLDM GDS, 1 IG, 1 WG) – 4

Two battalions will be assigned as general light role battalions, with the other two assigned to public duties. These battalions will periodically rotate roles and postings.

====Scottish Division====
The six battalions of the Scottish Division have amalgamated into a single five battalion regiment to be called the Royal Regiment of Scotland.
*Armoured Infantry (4 SCOTS) – 1
*Light Role (1 SCOTS, 2 SCOTS, 3 SCOTS) – 3
*Air Assault/Light Role (5 SCOTS) – 1

====King&#x27;s Division====
The six battalions of the King&#x27;s Division have amalgamated into two regiments;
*Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment (King&#x27;s Lancashire and Border) – this is a two battalion regiment formed from the amalgamation of the King&#x27;s Own Royal Border Regiment, King&#x27;s Regiment and Queen&#x27;s Lancashire Regiment.
**Mechanised Infantry (1 LANCS) – 1
**Light Role (2 LANCS) – 1
*Yorkshire Regiment – this is a three battalion regiment formed from the amalgamation of the Green Howards, Prince of Wales&#x27;s Own Regiment of Yorkshire and Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment.
**Armoured Infantry (3 YORKS) – 1
**Light Role (1 YORKS, 2 YORKS)- 2

====Prince of Wales&#x27;s Division====
The original seven battalions of the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Division have been reduced to five with the transfer of the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment and the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment to the Light Division. The five remaining battalions will amalgamate into two regiments;
*Royal Welsh – this is a two battalion regiment formed from the amalgamation of the Royal Welch Fusiliers and the Royal Regiment of Wales.
**Armoured Infantry (2 R WELSH) – 1
**Light Role (1 R WELSH) – 1
*Mercian Regiment – this is a three battalion regiment formed from the amalgamation of the 22nd (Cheshire) Regiment, Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment and Staffordshire Regiment.
**Armoured Infantry (3 MERCIAN) – 1
**Light Role (1 MERCIAN, 2 MERCIAN) – 2

====Queen&#x27;s Division====
The three existing large regiments of the Queen&#x27;s Division remain unaffected by the restructuring.
*Princess of Wales&#x27;s Royal Regiment
**Armoured Infantry (1 PWRR) – 1
**Light Role (2 PWRR) – 1
*Royal Regiment of Fusiliers
**Armoured Infantry (1 RRF) – 1
**Light Role (2 RRF) – 1
*Royal Anglian Regiment
**Mechanised Infantry (1 R ANGLIAN) – 1
**Light Role (2 R ANGLIAN) – 1
*Royal Gibraltar Regiment
**Light Role (1 RG) – 1

====Light Division====
The four current battalions of the Light Division in two regiments were augmented by two battalions from the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Division in 2005. These two were amalgamated into a single battalion and then amalgamated with Light Infantry and the Royal Green Jackets to form a new five battalion regiment, called The Rifles. On its formation, the Light Division was abolished.
*Armoured Infantry (5 RIFLES) – 1
*Light Role (2 RIFLES, 3 RIFLES) – 2
*Mechanised Infantry (4 RIFLES) – 1
*Commando (1 RIFLES) – 1

====Other infantry regiments====

* The single regular battalion of the Royal Irish Regiment is unamalgamated to &quot;retain an infantry footprint in Northern Ireland&quot;.
**Air Assault/Light Role (1 R IRISH) – 1
* The Royal Gurkha Rifles is unaffected by the restructuring. However, the UK based battalion has been integrated more fully with the rest of the infantry and trained in the air assault role.
**Air Assault/Light Role (2 RGR) – 1
**Light Role (1 RGR) – 1
* One battalion of the Parachute Regiment is the core of the &quot;special forces support battalion&quot;, no longer part of the Infantry order of battle. The other three operate in the Airborne role.
**Airborne/Light Role (2 PARA, 3 PARA) – 2

====Territorial Army====
With the exception of the Royal Gurkha Rifles, every line infantry regiment has at least one TA battalion (the Royal Regiment of Scotland and The Rifles have two). The Guards Division has The London Regiment as an affiliated TA battalion.

===Strategic Defence and Security Review (2010)/Army 2020===

Following the 2010 General Election, the new government instituted a new defence review. The ultimate conclusion of this process was to reduce the size of the British Army from approximately 102,000 to approximately 82,000 by 2020. The detail of the process was subsequently announced as &quot;Army 2020&quot; in July 2012. As part of this, the infantry was reduced in size from 36 regular battalions to 31. Of the five to be withdrawn, two were armoured infantry units, two general light infantry and one a specialist air assault infantry battalion. The withdrawal of two armoured infantry battalions is to bring this into line with the planned future operational structure, intended to see three &quot;armoured infantry brigades&quot;, each with a pair of infantry battalions, forming the core of the Army&#x27;s &quot;reaction forces&quot;. These two battalions, along with the two light infantry battalions, will be disbanded and their personnel distributed among the remaining battalions of each regiment. The air assault battalion will be reduced to company strength, with the intention that it is assigned as a permanent public duties unit in Scotland.

The affected regiments were:
*Royal Regiment of Scotland
**The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, 5th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland – Reduced to an incremental company and assigned to public duties in Scotland.
*Royal Regiment of Fusiliers
**2nd Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers – Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st Battalion.
*Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot)
**2nd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot) (Green Howards) – Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st and 3rd Battalions. 3 YORKS will eventually be renamed as 1 YORKS. 1 YORKS will eventually be renumbered as 2 YORKS.
*Mercian Regiment
**3rd Battalion, The Mercian Regiment (Staffords) – Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st and 2nd Battalions.
*Royal Welsh
**2nd Battalion, The Royal Welsh (Royal Regiment of Wales) – Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st Battalion.

In addition, the Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling), 83rd, 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment) was transferred to the administration of the Prince of Wales&#x27; Division.

===Army 2020 Refine===
Under a further review called Army 2020 Refine, the 1st Battalion, Scots Guards and the 4th Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland will be equipped with Mechanised Infantry Vehicles and form the core of the first Strike Brigade under the Reaction Force. Five infantry battalions will undertake the new specialist infantry role; these units will provide an increased contribution to countering terrorism and building stability overseas, and will number around 300 personnel. Four of these battalions, 1st Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland; 2nd Battalion, The Princess of Wales&#x27;s Royal Regiment; 2nd Battalion, The Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment; and 4th Battalion, The Rifles, will be existing battalions, while the fifth will be formed as a new battalion of the Royal Gurkha Rifles 

====Guards Division====
*Heavy Protected Mobility Infantry (1 SG) – 1
*Light Role Infantry (1 COLDM GDS, 1 IG) – 2
*Light Role/Public Duties (1 GREN GDS, 1 WG) – 2
*Public Duties (2 GREN GDS, 2 COLDM GDS, 2 SG)

*Specialised Training Infantry (3 RGR) – 1
*Army Reserve (4 PARA) – 1
==Other regiments==

===Disbanded regiments===
Over time, a handful of infantry regiments have disappeared from the roll through disbandment rather than amalgamation. In the twentieth century, eight regiments disappeared like this:
*In 1920, the Guards Machine Gun Regiment, a specialist infantry regiment originally formed in 1917, and given the status of a foot guards regiment (ranked as the sixth regiment of foot guards), was disbanded.
*In 1922, following cuts to the size of the armed forces after the First World War and the establishment of the Irish Free State, the five infantry regiments solely from the south of Ireland were disbanded:
**The Royal Irish Regiment
**The Connaught Rangers
**The Prince of Wales&#x27;s Leinster Regiment (Royal Canadians)
**The Royal Munster Fusiliers
**The Royal Dublin Fusiliers
*In 1968, after a re-organisation of the army, two regiments opted to be placed in suspended animation rather than amalgamate, and were eventually disbanded in 1987:
**The Cameronians (Scottish Rifles)
**The York and Lancaster Regiment

===Honourable Artillery Company===

The Honourable Artillery Company included infantry battalions from its formation up to 1973 when its infantry wing was amalgamated with its artillery batteries in a new role.

===Regiments that never were===
Since the Cardwell reforms began, infantry regiments in the British Army have amalgamated on many occasions. However, there have been occasions where amalgamations have been announced, but have then been abandoned:
*The Royal Regiment of Gloucestershire and Hampshire – planned as the amalgamation of the Gloucestershire Regiment and the Royal Hampshire Regiment. This was announced in July 1968 to be implemented in September 1970, but was cancelled in the autumn of that year. The two regiments were subsequently amalgamated with others to form the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment and the Princess of Wales&#x27;s Royal Regiment (Queen&#x27;s and Royal Hampshires)
*The Royal Scots Borderers – planned as the amalgamation of the Royal Scots and the King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers as part of Options for Change. This was cancelled on 3 February 1993. The name was resurrected with the formation of the Royal Regiment of Scotland, when the two regiments amalgamated as a single battalion.
*The Cheshire and Staffordshire Regiment – planned as the amalgamation of the 22nd (Cheshire) Regiment and the Staffordshire Regiment as part of Options for Change. This was cancelled on 3 February 1993. The two regiments were subsequently amalgamated as part of the Mercian Regiment.
*The Executive Committee of the Army Board proposed under Delivering Security in a Changing World that there would be a series of two battalion regiments formed. These may have included:
**A two battalion Lowland regiment formed from the Royal Scots and the King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers.
**A two battalion Highland regiment formed from the Royal Highland Fusiliers, Black Watch, Highlanders, and Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders.
**A two battalion Wessex regiment formed from the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment and Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment.
*Sikh Regiment – in 2007, Sikh leaders in the United Kingdom informed the Army that they would be able to find enough volunteers to form an initial infantry battalion of 700 from within their community. However, the Ministry of Defence, having requested advice from the Commission for Racial Equality, decided to reject the proposal on the grounds that it would be &quot;divisive and amounted to segregation&quot;. In 2015, the idea was revisited, with the Army evaluating the idea. However, the then Defence Secretary stated that he was &#x27;wary of separating military units according to religion&#x27;. The idea was again dropped in 2016. The Prince of Wales had made a similar suggestion in 2001.

<text>Paracetamol, or acetaminophen, is a non-opioid analgesic and antipyretic agent used to treat fever and mild to moderate pain. It is a widely available over-the-counter drug sold under various brand names, including Tylenol and Panadol.

Paracetamol relieves pain in both acute mild migraine and episodic tension headache. At a standard dose, paracetamol slightly reduces fever; it is inferior to ibuprofen in that respect, and the benefits of its use for fever are unclear, particularly in the context of fever of viral origins. The aspirin/paracetamol/caffeine combination also helps with both conditions where the pain is mild and is recommended as a first-line treatment for them. Paracetamol is effective for post-surgical pain, but it is inferior to ibuprofen. The paracetamol/ibuprofen combination provides further increase in potency and is superior to either drug alone. The pain relief paracetamol provides in osteoarthritis is small and clinically insignificant. The evidence in its favor for the use in low back pain, cancer pain, and neuropathic pain is insufficient.
In the short term, paracetamol is safe and effective when used as directed. Short term adverse effects are uncommon and similar to ibuprofen, but paracetamol is typically safer than nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for long-term use. Paracetamol is also often used in patients who cannot tolerate NSAIDs like ibuprofen. Chronic consumption of paracetamol may result in a drop in hemoglobin level, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding, and abnormal liver function tests. The recommended maximum daily dose for an adult is three to four grams. Higher doses may lead to toxicity, including liver failure. Paracetamol poisoning is the foremost cause of acute liver failure in the Western world, and accounts for most drug overdoses in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand.
Paracetamol was first made in 1878 by Harmon Northrop Morse or possibly in 1852 by Charles Frédéric Gerhardt. It is the most commonly used medication for pain and fever in both the United States and Europe. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Paracetamol is available as a generic medication, with brand names including Tylenol and Panadol among others. In 2022, it was the 114th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5million prescriptions.
==Medical uses==

===Fever===
Paracetamol is used for reducing fever. However, there has been a lack of research on its antipyretic properties, particularly in adults, and thus its benefits are unclear. As a result, it has been described as over-prescribed for this application. In addition, low-quality clinical data indicates that when used for the common cold, paracetamol may relieve a stuffed or runny nose, but not other cold symptoms such as sore throat, malaise, sneezing, or cough.

For people in critical care, paracetamol decreases body temperature by only 0.20.3°C more than control interventions and has no effect on their mortality. It did not change the outcome in febrile patients with stroke. The results are contradictory for paracetamol use in sepsis: higher mortality, lower mortality, and no change in mortality were all reported. Paracetamol offered no benefit in the treatment of dengue fever and was accompanied by a higher rate of liver enzyme elevation: a sign of potential liver damage. Overall, there is no support for a routine administration of antipyretic drugs, including paracetamol, to hospitalized patients with fever and infection.

The efficacy of paracetamol in children with fever is unclear. Paracetamol should not be used solely to reduce body temperature; however, it may be considered for children with fever who appear distressed. It does not prevent febrile seizures. It appears that 0.2°C decrease of the body temperature in children after a standard dose of paracetamol is of questionable value, particularly in emergencies. Based on this, some physicians advocate using higher doses that may decrease the temperature by as much as 0.7°C. Meta-analyses showed that paracetamol is less effective than ibuprofen in children (marginally less effective, according to another analysis), including children younger than 2 years old, with equivalent safety. Exacerbation of asthma occurs with similar frequency for both medications. Giving paracetamol and ibuprofen together at the same time to children under 5 is not recommended; however, doses may be alternated if required.

===Pain===
Paracetamol is used for the relief of mild to moderate pain such as headache, muscle aches, minor arthritis pain, toothache as well as pain caused by cold, flu, sprains, and dysmenorrhea. It is recommended, in particular, for acute mild to moderate pain, since the evidence for the treatment of chronic pain is insufficient.

====Musculoskeletal pain====
The benefits of paracetamol in musculoskeletal conditions, such as osteoarthritis and backache, are uncertain.

It appears to provide only small and not clinically important benefits in osteoarthritis. American College of Rheumatology and Arthritis Foundation guideline for the management of osteoarthritis notes that the effect size in clinical trials of paracetamol has been very small, which suggests that for most individuals it is ineffective. The guideline conditionally recommends paracetamol for short-term and episodic use to those who do not tolerate nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. For people taking it regularly, monitoring for liver toxicity is required. Essentially the same recommendation was issued by EULAR for hand osteoarthritis. Similarly, the ESCEO algorithm for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis recommends limiting the use of paracetamol to short-term rescue analgesia only.

Paracetamol is ineffective for acute low back pain. No randomized clinical trials evaluated its use for chronic or radicular back pain, and the evidence in favor of paracetamol is lacking.

====Headaches====

Paracetamol is effective for acute migraine: 39 % of people experience pain relief at one hour compared with 20 % in the control group. The aspirin/paracetamol/caffeine combination also &quot;has strong evidence of effectiveness and can be used as a first-line treatment for migraine&quot;. Paracetamol on its own only slightly alleviates episodic tension headache in those who have them frequently. However, the aspirin/paracetamol/caffeine combination is superior to both paracetamol alone and placebo and offers meaningful relief of tension headache: two hours after administering the medication, 29 % of those who took the combination were pain-free as compared with 21 % on paracetamol and 18 % on placebo. The German, Austrian, and Swiss headache societies and the German Society of Neurology recommend this combination as a &quot;highlighted&quot; one for self-medication of tension headache, with paracetamol/caffeine combination being a &quot;remedy of first choice&quot;, and paracetamol a &quot;remedy of second choice&quot;.

====Dental and other post-surgical pain====
Pain after a dental surgery provides a reliable model for the action of analgesics on other kinds of acute pain. For the relief of such pain, paracetamol is inferior to ibuprofen. Full therapeutic doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) ibuprofen, naproxen or diclofenac are clearly more efficacious than the paracetamol/codeine combination which is frequently prescribed for dental pain. The combinations of paracetamol and NSAIDs ibuprofen or diclofenac are promising, possibly offering better pain control than either paracetamol or the NSAID alone. Additionally, the paracetamol/ibuprofen combination may be superior to paracetamol/codeine and ibuprofen/codeine combinations.

A meta-analysis of general post-surgical pain, which included dental and other surgery, showed the paracetamol/codeine combination to be more effective than paracetamol alone: it provided significant pain relief to as much as 53 % of the participants, while the placebo helped only 7 %.

====Other pain====

Paracetamol fails to relieve procedural pain in newborn babies. For perineal pain postpartum paracetamol appears to be less effective than nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

The studies to support or refute the use of paracetamol for cancer pain and neuropathic pain are lacking. There is limited evidence in favor of the use of the intravenous form of paracetamol for acute pain control in the emergency department. The combination of paracetamol with caffeine is superior to paracetamol alone for the treatment of acute pain.

=== Patent ductus arteriosus ===
Paracetamol helps ductal closure in patent ductus arteriosus. It is as effective for this purpose as ibuprofen or indomethacin, but results in less frequent gastrointestinal bleeding than ibuprofen. Its use for extremely low birth weight and gestational age infants however requires further study.

==Adverse effects==
Gastrointestinal adverse effects such as nausea and abdominal pain are extremely uncommon, and their frequency is nothing 
like that of ibuprofen. Increase in risk-taking behavior is possible. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the drug may cause rare and possibly fatal skin reactions such as Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, Rechallenge tests and an analysis of American but not French pharmacovigilance databases indicated a risk of these reactions.

In clinical trials for osteoarthritis, the number of participants reporting adverse effects was similar for those on paracetamol and on placebo. However, the abnormal liver function tests (meaning there was some inflammation or damage to the liver) were almost four times more likely in those on paracetamol, although the clinical importance of this effect is uncertain. After 13 weeks of paracetamol therapy for knee pain, a drop in hemoglobin level indicating gastrointestinal bleeding was observed in 20 % of participants, this rate being similar to the ibuprofen group.

Due to the absence of controlled studies, most of the information about the long-term safety of paracetamol comes from observational studies. These indicate a consistent pattern of increased mortality as well as cardiovascular (stroke, myocardial infarction), gastrointestinal (ulcers, bleeding) and renal adverse effects with increased dose of paracetamol. Use of paracetamol is associated with 1.9 times higher risk of peptic ulcer. Those who take it regularly at a higher dose (more than 23g daily) are at much higher risk (3.63.7 times) of gastrointestinal bleeding and other bleeding events. Meta-analyses suggest that paracetamol may increase the risk of kidney impairment by 23 % and kidney cancer by 28 %. Paracetamol slightly but significantly increases blood pressure and heart rate. A 2022 double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study has provided evidence that daily, high-dose use (4 g per day) of paracetamol increases systolic BP. A review of available research has suggested that increase in systolic blood pressure and increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding associated with chronic paracetamol use shows a degree of dose dependence.

The association between paracetamol use and asthma in children has been a matter of controversy. However, the most recent research suggests that there is no association, and that the frequency of asthma exacerbations in children after paracetamol is the same as after another frequently used pain killer, ibuprofen.

In recommended doses, the side effects of paracetamol are mild to non-existent. In contrast to aspirin, it is not a blood thinner (and thus may be used in patients where bleeding is a concern), and it does not cause gastric irritation. Compared to Ibuprofen—which can have adverse effects that include diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain—paracetamol is well tolerated with fewer side effects. Prolonged daily use may cause kidney or liver damage. Paracetamol is metabolized by the liver and is hepatotoxic; side effects may be more likely in chronic alcoholics or patients with liver damage.

Until 2010 paracetamol was believed safe in pregnancy however, in a study published in October 2010 it has been linked to infertility in the adult life of the unborn. Like NSAIDs and unlike opioid analgesics, paracetamol has not been found to cause euphoria or alter mood. One recent research study showed evidence that paracetamol can ease psychological pain, but more studies are needed to draw a stronger conclusion. Unlike aspirin, it is safe for children, as paracetamol is not associated with a risk of Reye syndrome in children with viral illnesses. Chronic users of paracetamol may have a higher risk of developing blood cancer.

===Use in pregnancy===
Paracetamol safety in pregnancy has been under increased scrutiny. There appears to be no link between paracetamol use in the first trimester and adverse pregnancy outcomes or birth defects. However, indications exist of a possible increase in the risk of asthma and developmental and reproductive disorders in the offspring of women with prolonged use of paracetamol during pregnancy.

Paracetamol use by the mother during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma, but so are the maternal infections for which paracetamol may be used, and separating these influences is difficult. Paracetamol, in a small-scale meta-analysis was also associated with a 2030 % increase in autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and conduct disorder, with the association being lower in a meta-analysis where a larger demographic was used, but it is unclear whether this is a causal relationship and whether there was potential bias in the findings. There is also an argument that the large number, consistency, and robust designs of the studies provide strong evidence in favor of paracetamol causing the increased risk of these neurodevelopmental disorders. In animal experiments, paracetamol disrupts fetal testosterone production, and several epidemiological studies linked cryptorchidism with mother&#x27;s paracetamol use for more than two weeks in the second trimester. On the other hand, several studies did not find any association.

The consensus recommendation appears to be to avoid prolonged use of paracetamol in pregnancy and use it only when necessary, at the lowest effective dosage, and for the shortest time.

In pregnancy, paracetamol and metoclopramide are deemed safe as are NSAIDs until the third trimester.

==Overdose==

Overdose of paracetamol is caused by taking more than the recommended maximum daily dose of paracetamol for healthy adults (three or four grams), and can cause potentially fatal liver damage. A single dose should not exceed 1000 mg, doses should be taken no sooner than four hours apart, and no more than four doses (4000 mg) in 24 hours. While a majority of adult overdoses are linked to suicide attempts, many cases are accidental, often due to the use of more than one paracetamol-containing product over an extended period.

Paracetamol toxicity has become the foremost cause of acute liver failure in the United States by 2003, and , paracetamol accounted for most drug overdoses in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. As of 2004, paracetamol overdose resulted in more calls to poison control centers in the U.S. than overdose of any other pharmacological substance. According to the FDA, in the United States, &quot;56,000 emergency room visits, 26,000 hospitalizations, and 458 deaths per year [were] related to acetaminophen-associated overdoses during the 1990s. Within these estimates, unintentional acetaminophen overdose accounted for nearly 25% of the emergency department visits, 10% of the hospitalizations, and 25% of the deaths.&quot;

Overdoses are frequently related to high-dose recreational use of prescription opioids, as these opioids are most often combined with paracetamol. The overdose risk may be heightened by frequent consumption of alcohol.

Untreated paracetamol overdose results in a lengthy, painful illness. Signs and symptoms of paracetamol toxicity may initially be absent or non-specific symptoms. The first symptoms of overdose usually begin several hours after ingestion, with nausea, vomiting, sweating, and pain as acute liver failure starts. People who take overdoses of paracetamol do not fall asleep or lose consciousness, although most people who attempt suicide with paracetamol wrongly believe that they will be rendered unconscious by the drug.

Treatment is aimed at removing the paracetamol from the body and replenishing glutathione. Activated charcoal can be used to decrease absorption of paracetamol if the person comes to the hospital soon after the overdose. While the antidote, acetylcysteine (also called &quot;N&quot;-acetylcysteine or NAC), acts as a precursor for glutathione, helping the body regenerate enough to prevent or at least decrease the possible damage to the liver; a liver transplant is often required if damage to the liver becomes severe.

NAC was usually given following a treatment nomogram (one for people with risk factors, and one for those without), but the use of the nomogram is no longer recommended as evidence to support the use of risk factors was poor and inconsistent, and many of the risk factors are imprecise and difficult to determine with sufficient certainty in clinical practice. Toxicity of paracetamol is due to its quinone metabolite NAPQI and NAC also helps in neutralizing it. Kidney failure is also a possible side effect.

==Interactions==

Prokinetic agents such as metoclopramide accelerate gastric emptying, shorten time (tmax) to paracetamol peak blood plasma concentration (Cmax), and increase Cmax. Medications slowing gastric emptying such as propantheline and morphine lengthen tmax and decrease Cmax. The interaction with morphine may result in patients failing to achieve the therapeutic concentration of paracetamol; the clinical significance of interactions with metoclopramide and propantheline is unclear.

There have been suspicions that cytochrome inducers may enhance the toxic pathway of paracetamol metabolism to NAPQI (see Paracetamol#Pharmacokinetics). By and large, these suspicions have not been confirmed. Out of the inducers studied, the evidence of potentially increased liver toxicity in paracetamol overdose exists for phenobarbital, primidone, isoniazid, and possibly St John&#x27;s wort. On the other hand, the anti-tuberculosis drug isoniazid cuts the formation of NAPQI by 70%.

Ranitidine increased paracetamol area under the curve (AUC) 1.6-fold. AUC increases are also observed with nizatidine and cisapride. The effect is explained by these drugs inhibiting glucuronidation of paracetamol.

Paracetamol raises plasma concentrations of ethinylestradiol by 22 % by inhibiting its sulfation. Paracetamol increases INR during warfarin therapy and should be limited to no more than 2 g per week.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===

Paracetamol appears to exert its effects through two mechanisms: the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) and actions of its metabolite &quot;N&quot;-arachidonoylphenolamine (AM404).

Supporting the first mechanism, pharmacologically and in its side effects, paracetamol is close to classical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that act by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes and especially similar to selective COX-2 inhibitors. Paracetamol inhibits prostaglandin synthesis by reducing the active form of COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. This occurs only when the concentration of arachidonic acid and peroxides is low. Under these conditions, COX-2 is the predominant form of cyclooxygenase, which explains the apparent COX-2 selectivity of paracetamol. Under the conditions of inflammation, the concentration of peroxides is high, which counteracts the reducing effect of paracetamol. Accordingly, the anti-inflammatory action of paracetamol is slight. The anti-inflammatory action of paracetamol (via COX inhibition) has also been found to primarily target the central nervous system and not peripheral areas of the body, explaining the lack of side effects associated with conventional NSAIDs such as gastric bleeding.

The second mechanism centers on the paracetamol metabolite AM404. This metabolite has been detected in the brains of animals and cerebrospinal fluid of humans taking paracetamol. It is formed in the brain from another paracetamol metabolite 4-aminophenol by action of fatty acid amide hydrolase. AM404 is a weak agonist of cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2, an inhibitor of endocannabinoid transporter, and a potent activator of TRPV1 receptor. This and other research indicate that the endocannabinoid system and TRPV1 may play an important role in the analgesic effect of paracetamol.

In 2018, Suemaru &quot;et al&quot;. found that, in mice, paracetamol exerts an anticonvulsant effect by activation of the TRPV1 receptors and a decrease in neuronal excitability by hyperpolarization of neurons. The exact mechanism of the anticonvulsant effect of paracetamol is not clear. According to Suemaru &quot;et al&quot;., acetaminophen and its active metabolite AM404 show a dose-dependent anticonvulsant activity against pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures in mice.

===Pharmacokinetics===
After being taken by mouth, paracetamol is rapidly absorbed from the small intestine, while absorption from the stomach is negligible. Thus, the rate of absorption depends on stomach emptying. Food slows the stomach&#x27;s emptying and absorption, but the total amount absorbed stays the same. In the same subjects, the peak plasma concentration of paracetamol was reached after 20 minutes when fasting versus 90 minutes when fed. High carbohydrate (but not high protein or high fat) food decreases paracetamol peak plasma concentration by four times. Even in the fasting state, the rate of absorption of paracetamol is variable and depends on the formulation, with maximum plasma concentration being reached after 20 minutes to 1.5 hours.

Paracetamol&#x27;s bioavailability is dose-dependent: it increases from 63 % for 500mg dose to 89 % for 1000mg dose. Its plasma terminal elimination half-life is 1.92.5 hours, and volume of distribution is roughly 50L. Protein binding is negligible, except under the conditions of overdose, when it may reach 1521 %. The concentration in serum after a typical dose of paracetamol usually peaks below 30μg/mL (200μmol/L). After 4 hours, the concentration is usually less than 10μg/mL (66μmol/L).

Paracetamol is metabolized primarily in the liver, mainly by glucuronidation and sulfation, and the products are then eliminated in the urine (see the Scheme on the right). Only 25 % of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Glucuronidation by UGT1A1 and UGT1A6 accounts for 5070 % of the drug metabolism. Additional 2535 % of paracetamol is converted to sulfate by sulfation enzymes SULT1A1, SULT1A3, and SULT1E1.

A minor metabolic pathway (5–15 %) of oxidation by cytochrome P450 enzymes, mainly by CYP2E1, forms a toxic metabolite known as NAPQI (&quot;N&quot;-acetyl-&quot;p&quot;-benzoquinone imine). NAPQI is responsible for the liver toxicity of paracetamol. At usual doses of paracetamol, NAPQI is quickly detoxified by conjugation with glutathione. The non-toxic conjugate APAP-GSH is taken up in the bile and further degraded to mercapturic and cysteine conjugates that are excreted in the urine. In overdose, glutathione is depleted by a large amount of formed NAPQI, and NAPQI binds to mitochondria proteins of the liver cells causing oxidative stress and toxicity.

Yet another minor but important direction of metabolism is deacetylation of 12 % of paracetamol to form &quot;p&quot;-aminophenol. &quot;p&quot;-Aminophenol is then converted in the brain by fatty acid amide hydrolase into AM404, a compound that may be partially responsible for the analgesic action of paracetamol.

==Chemistry==

===Synthesis===

====Classical methods====
The classical methods for the production of paracetamol involve the acetylation of 4-aminophenol with acetic anhydride as the last step. They differ in how 4-aminophenol is prepared. In one method, nitration of phenol with nitric acid affords 4-nitrophenol, which is reduced to 4-aminophenol by hydrogenation over Raney nickel. In another method, nitrobenzene is reduced electrolytically giving 4-aminophenol directly. Additionally, 4-nitrophenol can be selectively reduced by Tin(II) Chloride in absolute ethanol or ethyl acetate to produce a 91 % yield of 4-aminophenol.
====Celanese synthesis====
An alternative industrial synthesis developed at Celanese involves firstly direct acylation of phenol with acetic anhydride in the presence of hydrogen fluoride to a ketone, then the conversion of the ketone with hydroxylamine to a ketoxime, and finally the acid-catalyzed Beckmann rearrangement of the cetoxime to the para-acetylaminophenol product.

===Reactions===
&quot;4&quot;-Aminophenol may be obtained by the amide hydrolysis of paracetamol. This reaction is also used to determine paracetamol in urine samples: After hydrolysis with hydrochloric acid, &quot;4&quot;-aminophenol reacts in ammonia solution with a phenol derivate, e.g. salicylic acid, to form an indophenol dye under oxidization by air.

==History==
Acetanilide was the first aniline derivative serendipitously found to possess analgesic as well as antipyretic properties, and was quickly introduced into medical practice under the name of Antifebrin by Cahn &amp; Hepp in 1886. But its unacceptable toxic effectsthe most alarming being cyanosis due to methemoglobinemia, an increase of hemoglobin in its ferric [Fe3+] state, called methemoglobin, which cannot bind oxygen, and thus decreases overall carriage of oxygen to tissueprompted the search for less toxic aniline derivatives. Some reports state that Cahn &amp; Hepp or a French chemist called Charles Gerhardt first synthesized paracetamol in 1852.

Harmon Northrop Morse synthesized paracetamol at Johns Hopkins University via the reduction of &quot;p&quot;-nitrophenol with tin in glacial acetic acid in 1877, but it was not until 1887 that clinical pharmacologist Joseph von Mering tried paracetamol on humans. In 1893, von Mering published a paper reporting on the clinical results of paracetamol with phenacetin, another aniline derivative. Von Mering claimed that, unlike phenacetin, paracetamol had a slight tendency to produce methemoglobinemia. Paracetamol was then quickly discarded in favor of phenacetin. The sales of phenacetin established Bayer as a leading pharmaceutical company.

Von Mering&#x27;s claims remained essentially unchallenged for half a century until two teams of researchers from the United States analyzed the metabolism of acetanilide and phenacetin. In 1947, David Lester and Leon Greenberg found strong evidence that paracetamol was a major metabolite of acetanilide in human blood, and in a subsequent study they reported that large doses of paracetamol given to albino rats did not cause methemoglobinemia. In 1948, Bernard Brodie, Julius Axelrod and Frederick Flinn confirmed that paracetamol was the major metabolite of acetanilide in humans, and established that it was just as efficacious an analgesic as its precursor. They also suggested that methemoglobinemia is produced in humans mainly by another metabolite, phenylhydroxylamine. A follow-up paper by Brodie and Axelrod in 1949 established that phenacetin was also metabolized to paracetamol. This led to a &quot;rediscovery&quot; of paracetamol.

Paracetamol was first marketed in the United States in 1950 under the name Trigesic, a combination of paracetamol, aspirin, and caffeine. Reports in 1951 of three users stricken with the blood disease agranulocytosis led to its removal from the marketplace, and it took several years until it became clear that the disease was unconnected. The following year, 1952, paracetamol returned to the U.S. market as a prescription drug. In the United Kingdom, marketing of paracetamol began in 1956 by Sterling-Winthrop Co. as Panadol, available only by prescription, and promoted as preferable to aspirin since it was safe for children and people with ulcers. In 1963, paracetamol was added to the &quot;British Pharmacopoeia&quot;, and has gained popularity since then as an analgesic agent with few side-effects and little interaction with other pharmaceutical agents.

Concerns about paracetamol&#x27;s safety delayed its widespread acceptance until the 1970s, but in the 1980s paracetamol sales exceeded those of aspirin in many countries, including the United Kingdom. This was accompanied by the commercial demise of phenacetin, blamed as the cause of analgesic nephropathy and hematological toxicity. Available in the U.S. without a prescription since 1955 (1960, according to another source), paracetamol has become a common household drug. In 1988, Sterling Winthrop was acquired by Eastman Kodak which sold the over the counter drug rights to SmithKline Beecham in 1994.

In June 2009, an FDA advisory committee recommended that new restrictions be placed on paracetamol use in the United States to help protect people from the potential toxic effects. The maximum single adult dosage would be decreased from 1000mg to 650mg, while combinations of paracetamol and other products would be prohibited. Committee members were particularly concerned by the fact that the then-present maximum dosages of paracetamol had been shown to produce alterations in liver function.

In January 2011, the FDA asked manufacturers of prescription combination products containing paracetamol to limit its amount to no more than 325mg per tablet or capsule and began requiring manufacturers to update the labels of all prescription combination paracetamol products to warn of the potential risk of severe liver damage. Manufacturers had three years to limit the amount of paracetamol in their prescription drug products to 325mg per dosage unit.

In November 2011, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency revised UK dosing of liquid paracetamol for children.

In September 2013, &quot;Use Only as Directed&quot;, an episode of the radio program &quot;This American Life&quot; highlighted deaths from paracetamol overdose. This report was followed by two reports by ProPublica alleging that the &quot;FDA has long been aware of studies showing the risks of acetaminophen. So has the maker of Tylenol, McNeil Consumer Healthcare, a division of Johnson &amp; Johnson&quot; and &quot;McNeil, the maker of Tylenol, ... has repeatedly opposed safety warnings, dosage restrictions and other measures meant to safeguard users of the drug.&quot;

==Society and culture==

===Naming===
&quot;Paracetamol&quot; is the Australian Approved Name and British Approved Name as well as the international nonproprietary name used by the WHO and in many other countries; &quot;acetaminophen&quot; is the United States Adopted Name and Japanese Accepted Name and also the name generally used in Canada, Venezuela, Colombia, and Iran. Both &quot;paracetamol&quot; and &quot;acetaminophen&quot; are contractions of chemical names for the compound. The word &quot;paracetamol&quot; is a shortened form of para-acetylaminophenol, and was coined by Frederick Stearns &amp; Co in 1956, while the word &quot;acetaminophen&quot; is a shortened form of N-acetyl-p-aminophenol (APAP), which was coined and first marketed by McNeil Laboratories in 1955. The initialism &quot;APAP&quot; is used by dispensing pharmacists in the United States.

===Available forms===
Paracetamol is available in oral, suppository, and intravenous forms. Intravenous paracetamol is sold under the brand name Ofirmev in the United States.

In some formulations, paracetamol is combined with the opiate codeine, sometimes referred to as co-codamol (BAN) and Panadeine in Australia. In the U.S., this combination is available only by prescription. As of 1 February 2018, medications containing codeine also became prescription-only in Australia. Paracetamol is also combined with other opioids such as dihydrocodeine, referred to as co-dydramol (British Approved Name (BAN)), oxycodone or hydrocodone. Another very commonly used analgesic combination includes paracetamol in combination with propoxyphene napsylate. A combination of paracetamol, codeine, and the doxylamine succinate is also available.

Paracetamol is sometimes combined with phenylephrine hydrochloride. Sometimes a third active ingredient, such as ascorbic acid, caffeine, chlorpheniramine maleate, or guaifenesin is added to this combination.

== Research ==
Claims that paracetamol is an effective analgesic medication to treat symptoms of COVID-19 were found to be unsubstantiated.

==Veterinary use==
===Cats===
Paracetamol is extremely toxic to cats, which lack the necessary UGT1A6 enzyme to detoxify it. Initial symptoms include vomiting, salivation, and discoloration of the tongue and gums. Unlike an overdose in humans, liver damage is rarely the cause of death; instead, methemoglobin formation and the production of Heinz bodies in red blood cells inhibit oxygen transport by the blood, causing asphyxiation (methemoglobinemia and hemolytic anemia). Treatment of the toxicosis with acetylcysteine is recommended.

===Dogs===
Paracetamol has been reported to be as effective as aspirin in the treatment of musculoskeletal pain in dogs. A paracetamol–codeine product (brand name Pardale-V) licensed for use in dogs is available for purchase under supervision of a vet, pharmacist or other qualified person. It should be administered to dogs only on veterinary advice and with extreme caution.

The main effect of toxicity in dogs is liver damage, and GI ulceration has been reported. Acetylcysteine treatment is efficacious in dogs when administered within two hours of paracetamol ingestion.

===Snakes===
Paracetamol is lethal to snakes and has been suggested as a chemical control program for the invasive brown tree snake (&quot;Boiga irregularis&quot;) in Guam. Doses of 80mg are inserted into dead mice that are scattered by helicopter as lethal bait to be consumed by the snakes.

<doc id="83407" wikidata="Q3245302" url="?curid=83407" title="Tylenol (brand)">
<text>Tylenol () is a brand of medication, advertised for reducing pain, reducing fever, and relieving the symptoms of allergies, cold, cough, headache, and influenza. The active ingredient of its original flagship product is paracetamol (known in the United States, Canada, and various other countries as &quot;acetaminophen&quot;), an analgesic and antipyretic. Like the words &quot;paracetamol&quot; and &quot;acetaminophen&quot;, the brand name &quot;Tylenol&quot; is derived from a chemical name for the compound, &quot;N&quot;-acetyl-&quot;para&quot;-aminophenol (APAP). The brand name is owned by McNeil Consumer Healthcare, a subsidiary of Kenvue.

==Medical uses==
The active ingredient in Tylenol is paracetamol, a widely used over-the-counter analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer). Formulations with additional active ingredients intended to target specific applications are sold under the Tylenol brand. These can include codeine as co-codamol, dextromethorphan, methocarbamol, guaifenesin, pseudoephedrine, caffeine, diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine and phenylephrine.

==History==
The brand was introduced in 1955 by McNeil Laboratories, a family-owned pharmaceutical manufacturer. Two brothers took over the company from their father that year, and one of them subsequently learned about paracetamol, which was not on the U.S. market at that time. To avoid competing with aspirin, they marketed it as a product to reduce fever in children, packaging it like a red fire truck with the slogan, &quot;for little hotheads&quot;. The brand name &quot;Tylenol&quot; and the United States Adopted Name &quot;acetaminophen&quot; were generated by McNeil from the chemical name of the drug, &quot;N&quot;-acetyl-&quot;para&quot;-aminophenol (APAP).

Johnson &amp; Johnson bought McNeil in 1959, and one year later the drug was made available over the counter.

==Recalls==
===1982 Chicago Tylenol murders===

On September 29, 1982, a &quot;Tylenol scare&quot; began when the first of seven individuals died in the Chicago metropolitan area after ingesting Extra Strength Tylenol that had been deliberately contaminated with cyanide. Within a week, the company pulled 31 million bottles of tablets back from retailers, making it one of the first major product recalls in American history.

As a result of the crisis, all Tylenol capsules were discontinued, as were capsules of other brand names. Retained by McNeil&#x27;s president, new product consultant Martin Calle of management strategist Calle &amp; Company conceived the world&#x27;s first tamper-resistant gelatin-enrobed capsule called &quot;Tylenol Gelcaps&quot;, which proved to resuscitate the 92% of capsule-segment sales lost to the recall. The tamper-resistant, triple-sealed safety containers were placed on the shelves of retailers ten weeks after the withdrawal, and other manufacturers followed suit. The crisis cost the company more than , but Tylenol regained 100% of the market share it had before the crisis. 

The Tylenol murderer was never found, (though later James Lewis was a prime suspect) and a reward offered by Johnson &amp; Johnson remained unclaimed as of 2023.

Before the poisonings, Tylenol brands held around 35% of the US market for acetaminophen and in the immediate aftermath, fell to 8%. Within a year sales had rebounded to the prior levels. J&amp;J&#x27;s handling of the crisis has been widely cited as an example of optimal crisis management.

These events led to the widespread use of tamper resistance packaging of drugs by drug companies, to the 1982 passage of a US federal law making tampering a crime, and to legislation in 1989 requiring tamper-proof packaging.

===2010 Tylenol recalls===
On January 15, 2010, a voluntary recall of several hundred batches of popular medicines was announced, including Benadryl, Motrin, Rolaids, Simply Sleep, St. Joseph Aspirin, and Tylenol. The recall was due to complaints of a musty smell suspected to be due to contamination of the packaging with the chemical 2,4,6-tribromoanisole. The full health effects of 2,4,6-tribromoanisole are not known but no serious events have been documented in medical literature. The recall came 20 months after McNeil first began receiving and investigating consumer complaints about moldy-smelling bottles of Tylenol Arthritis Relief caplets, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The recall included 53 million bottles of over-the-counter products, involving lots in the Americas, the United Arab Emirates, and Fiji.

===Children&#x27;s Tylenol===

On April 30, 2010, another recall was issued for 40 products including liquid infant and children&#x27;s pain relievers Tylenol and Motrin, and allergy medications Zyrtec and Benadryl. An FDA report said its inspectors found thick dust and grime covering certain equipment, a hole in the ceiling, and duct tape-covered pipes at the Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, facility that made 40 products recalled. New testing regulations were enacted after the recall to ensure product quality and safety.

On May 5, 2010, the FDA confirmed that the bacterium found at the Johnson &amp; Johnson plant that made the recalled Children&#x27;s Tylenol was &quot;Burkholderia cepacia&quot;, a bacterium often resistant to common antibiotics. The bacteria were found on the outside of certain product-containing drums, but not in the finished product. The CDC has stated that &quot;Burkholderia cepacia&quot; is not likely to cause health problems for those with healthy immune systems. Those with weaker ones and those with chronic lung diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, could be more susceptible to infection.

==Questions about safety during pregnancy==
A 2014 study found that &quot;Maternal acetaminophen use during pregnancy is associated with a higher risk for HKDs and ADHD-like behaviors in children.&quot;
The study was the first of its kind, and concluded that, &quot;because the exposure and outcome are frequent, these results are of public health relevance but further investigations are needed.&quot; 

In September 2021, the United States Food and Drug Administration released a statement amid growing concern about the potential impact of Tylenol during pregnancy, and concluded that the studies were &quot;too limited to make any recommendations based on these studies at this time. Because of this 
uncertainty, the use of pain medicines during pregnancy should be carefully considered. 
We urge pregnant women to always discuss all medicines with their health care 
professionals before using them.&quot;

==Advertising==
Tylenol has many different advertisement approaches. One of these advertisement campaigns focuses on &quot;getting you back to normal&quot;, whereas the other commercials focus on Tylenol&#x27;s current slogan, &quot;Feel better, Tylenol&quot;. In the &quot;Feel better, Tylenol&quot; commercials, Tylenol places emphasis on the importance of sleep; various people are seen sleeping in this commercial while a voiceover describes how sleep can help repair and heal the human body during times of aches and pains. In the &quot;getting you back to normal&quot; commercial, Tylenol places more emphasis on helping its consumers get back to their daily routines; many different people are shown first experiencing headaches and other sorts of body pain, where a voiceover then states that Tylenol Rapid Release can help rid aches and pains; the various people are then shown enjoying their everyday lives, and are seen as &quot;back to normal&quot;.

In an older commercial from 1986, Tylenol emphasized that it is the drug that American hospitals trust the most. In this ad, Susan Sullivan told the consumer that Tylenol was a drug that could be trusted by Americans since many doctors also trusted it; she went on to state that doctors prescribed Tylenol four times more often than other leading pain relieving drugs combined.

A form that contains dextromethorphan, pseudoephedrine, acetaminophen, and chlorpheniramine, is sold as Cotylenol.

<text>RMS &quot;Olympic&quot; was a British ocean liner and the lead ship of the White Star Line&#x27;s trio of liners. &quot;Olympic&quot; had a career spanning 24 years from 1911 to 1935, in contrast to her short-lived sister ships, &quot;Titanic&quot; and . This included service as a troopship during the First World War, which gained her the nickname &quot;Old Reliable&quot;, and during which she rammed and sank the U-boat &quot;U-103&quot;. She returned to civilian service after the war, and served successfully as an ocean liner throughout the 1920s and into the first half of the 1930s, although increased competition, and the slump in trade during the Great Depression after 1930, made her operation increasingly unprofitable. &quot;Olympic&quot; was withdrawn from service and sold for scrap on 12 April 1935, which was completed in 1937.

&quot;Olympic&quot; was the largest ocean liner in the world for two periods during 1910–13, interrupted only by the brief tenure of the slightly larger , which had the same dimensions but higher gross register tonnage, before the German went into service in June 1913. &quot;Olympic&quot; also held the title of the largest British-built liner until was launched in 1934, interrupted only by the short careers of &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;Britannic&quot;. The other two ships in the class had short service lives: in 1912, &quot;Titanic&quot; collided with an iceberg on her maiden voyage and sank in the North Atlantic; &quot;Britannic&quot; never operated in her intended role as a passenger ship, instead serving as a hospital ship during the First World War until she hit a mine and sank in the Aegean Sea in 1916, less than a year after entering service.

== Background and construction ==

Built in Belfast, Ireland, &quot;Olympic&quot; was the first of the three s – the others being and . They were the largest vessels built for the British shipping company White Star Line, which was a fleet of 29 steamers and tenders in 1912. The three ships had their genesis in a discussion in mid-1907 between the White Star Line&#x27;s chairman, J. Bruce Ismay, and the American financier J. Pierpont Morgan, who controlled the White Star Line&#x27;s parent corporation, the International Mercantile Marine Co. The White Star Line faced a growing challenge from its main rivals Cunard, which had just launched and – the fastest passenger ships then in service – and the German lines Hamburg America and Norddeutscher Lloyd. Ismay preferred to compete on size and economics rather than speed and proposed to commission a new class of liners that would be bigger than anything that had gone before as well as being the last word in comfort and luxury. The company sought an upgrade in their fleet primarily in response to the largest Cunarders but also to replace their largest and now outclassed ships from 1890, and . The former was replaced by &quot;Olympic&quot; while &quot;Majestic&quot; was replaced by &quot;Titanic&quot;. &quot;Majestic&quot; would be brought back into her old spot on White Star&#x27;s New York service after &quot;Titanic&quot;″s loss.

The ships were built in Belfast by Harland &amp; Wolff, who had a long-established relationship with the White Star Line dating back to 1867. Harland and Wolff were given a great deal of latitude in designing ships for the White Star Line; the usual approach was for the latter to sketch out a general concept which the former would take away and turn into a ship design. Cost considerations were relatively low on the agenda and Harland and Wolff was authorised to spend what it needed on the ships, plus a five per cent profit margin. In the case of the &quot;Olympic&quot;-class ships, a cost of £3 million for the first two ships was agreed plus &quot;extras to contract&quot; and the usual five per cent fee.

Harland and Wolff put their designers to work designing the &quot;Olympic&quot;-class vessels. It was overseen by Lord Pirrie, a director of both Harland and Wolff and the White Star Line; naval architect Thomas Andrews, the managing director of Harland and Wolff&#x27;s design department; Edward Wilding, Andrews&#x27; deputy and responsible for calculating the ship&#x27;s design, stability and trim; and Alexander Carlisle, the shipyard&#x27;s chief draughtsman and general manager. Carlisle&#x27;s responsibilities included the decorations, equipment and all general arrangements, including the implementation of an efficient lifeboat davit design.
On 29 July 1908, Harland and Wolff presented the drawings to Bruce Ismay and other White Star Line executives. Ismay approved the design and signed three &quot;letters of agreement&quot; two days later authorising the start of construction. At this point the lead ship – which was later to become &quot;Olympic&quot; – had no name, but was referred to simply as &quot;Number 400&quot;, as it was Harland and Wolff&#x27;s four hundredth hull. &quot;Titanic&quot; was based on a revised version of the same design and was given the number 401. Bruce Ismay&#x27;s father Thomas Henry Ismay had previously planned to build a ship named &quot;Olympic&quot; as a sister ship to . The senior Ismay died in 1899 and the order for the ship was cancelled.

Construction of &quot;Olympic&quot; began three months before &quot;Titanic&quot; to ease pressures on the shipyard. Several years would pass before &quot;Britannic&quot; would be launched. To accommodate the construction of the class, Harland and Wolff upgraded their facility in Belfast; the most dramatic change was the combining of three slipways into two larger ones. &quot;Olympic&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot; were constructed side by side. &quot;Olympic&quot;″s keel was laid on 16 December 1908 and she was launched on 20 October 1910, without having been christened beforehand. By tradition, the White Star Line never christened any of their vessels and for the launch the hull was painted in a light grey colour for photographic purposes; a common practice of the day for the first ship in a new class, as it made the lines of the ship clearer in the black-and-white photographs. The launch was filmed both in black and white and in Kinemacolor, with only the black and white footage surviving. The launches of &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;Britannic&quot; were also filmed, though only &quot;Britannic&quot;&#x27;s survived. Her hull was repainted black following the launch. The ship was then dry-docked for fitting out.
&quot;Olympic&quot; was driven by three propellers. The two three-bladed wing propellers were driven by two triple-expansion engines, while the four-bladed central propeller was driven by a turbine that used recovered steam escaping from the triple-expansion engines. The use of escaped steam was tested on the two years earlier.

==Lifeboats==

&quot;Olympic&quot; lifeboat arrangement in 1911–12 was identical to &quot;Titanic&quot;fourteen regulation boats, two emergency cutters and the White Star complement of four collapsible boats. Two collapsibles were stored (collapsible C and D) broken down under the lead boats on the port and starboard sides. The final two collapsibles were stored on the top of the officers&#x27; quarters on either side of the number one funnel. Collapsible lifeboat B was stored on the port side roof of the officers quarters and collapsible lifeboat A was on the starboard side on the roof of the officers quarters.

== Features ==

&quot;Olympic&quot; was designed as a luxury ship; &quot;Titanic&quot; passenger facilities, fittings, deck plans and technical facilities were largely identical to &quot;Olympic&quot;, although with some small variations. The first-class passengers enjoyed luxurious cabins, and some were equipped with private bathrooms. First-class passengers could have meals in the ship&#x27;s large and luxurious dining saloon or in the more intimate A La Carte Restaurant. There was a lavish Grand Staircase, built only for the &quot;Olympic&quot;-class ships, along with three lifts that ran behind the staircase down to E deck, a Georgian-style smoking room, a Veranda Café decorated with palm trees, a swimming pool, Victorian Turkish bath, gymnasium, and several other places for meals and entertainment.

The second-class facilities included a smoking room, a library, a spacious dining room, and a lift.

Finally, the third-class passengers enjoyed reasonable accommodation compared to other ships. Instead of large dormitories offered by most ships of the time, the third-class passengers of &quot;Olympic&quot; travelled in cabins containing two to ten bunks. Facilities for the third class included a smoking room, a common area, and a dining room.

&quot;Olympic&quot; had a cleaner, sleeker look than other ships of the day: rather than fitting her with bulky exterior air vents, Harland and Wolff used smaller air vents with electric fans, with a &quot;dummy&quot; fourth funnel used for additional ventilation. For the power plant Harland and Wolff employed a combination of reciprocating engines with a centre low-pressure turbine, as opposed to the steam turbines used on Cunard&#x27;s &quot;Lusitania&quot; and &quot;Mauretania&quot;. White Star had successfully tested this engine configuration on the earlier liner , where it was found to be more economical than expansion engines or turbines alone. &quot;Olympic&quot; consumed 650 tons of coal per 24 hours with an average speed of 21.7 knots on her maiden voyage, compared to 1,000 tons of coal per 24 hours for both &quot;Lusitania&quot; and &quot;Mauretania&quot;.

==Differences from &quot;Titanic&quot;==
The &quot;Olympic&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot; were nearly identical, and were based on the same core design. A few alterations were made to &quot;Titanic&quot; and later on &quot;Britannic&quot; which were based on experience gained from &quot;Olympic&quot;″s first year in service. The most noticeable of these was that the forward half of &quot;Titanic&quot;″s A Deck promenade was enclosed by a steel screen with sliding windows, to provide additional shelter, whereas &quot;Olympic&quot;″s promenade deck remained open along its whole length. The additional enclosed volume was a major contributor to &quot;Titanic&quot;″s increased gross register tonnage of 46,328 tons over &quot;Olympic&quot;″s 45,324 tons, which allowed &quot;Titanic&quot; to claim the title of largest ship in the world.

Additionally, the B-Deck First-Class promenade decks installed on &quot;Olympic&quot; had proven to be scarcely used because of the already ample promenade space on A-Deck. Accordingly, Thomas Andrews eliminated this feature on &quot;Titanic&quot; and built additional, enlarged staterooms with en-suite bathrooms. It also allowed a Café Parisien in the style of a French sidewalk café to be added as an annexe to the À la Carte Restaurant, and for the Restaurant itself to be expanded to the Port-side of the ship. One drawback of this was that the Second-Class promenade space on B-Deck was reduced aboard &quot;Titanic&quot;.

A reception area for the restaurant was added in the foyer of the B-Deck aft Grand Staircase on &quot;Titanic&quot;, which did not exist on &quot;Olympic&quot;, and the main reception room on D-Deck was also slightly enlarged. private promenade decks were added to the two luxury parlour suites on B-Deck on &quot;Titanic&quot;, as well as additional First-Class gangway entrances on B-Deck. Cosmetic differences also existed between the two ships, most noticeably concerning the wider use of Axminster carpeting in &quot;Titanic&quot;″s public rooms, as opposed to the more durable linoleum flooring on &quot;Olympic&quot;.

Most of these shortcomings on &quot;Olympic&quot; would be addressed in her 1913 refit, which altered the configuration of &quot;Olympic&quot;″s First-Class sections to be more like those of &quot;Titanic&quot;. Although the A-Deck Promenade remained open for the entirety of &quot;Olympic&quot;″s career, the B-Deck promenade was vetoed and staterooms added like those on &quot;Titanic&quot;, as well as a Café Parisien and enlarged restaurant. The 1913 refit also included modifications for greater safety after the loss of the &quot;Titanic&quot;, including the addition of extra lifeboats and the addition of an inner watertight skin in the hull along about half the length of the ship. An extra watertight compartment was added bringing the total of watertight compartments to 17. Five watertight bulkheads were raised to B deck. Along with these improvements there were many others included in the 1913 refit.

== Career ==
Following completion, &quot;Olympic&quot; started her sea trials on 29 May 1911 during which her manoeuvrability, compass, and wireless telegraphy were tested. No speed test was carried out. She completed her sea trial successfully. &quot;Olympic&quot; then left Belfast bound for Liverpool, her port of registration, on 31 May 1911. As a publicity stunt the White Star Line timed the start of this first voyage to coincide with the launch of &quot;Titanic&quot;. After spending a day in Liverpool, open to the public, &quot;Olympic&quot; sailed to Southampton, where she arrived on 3 June, to be made ready for her maiden voyage. Her arrival generated enthusiasm from her crew and newspapers. The deep-water dock at Southampton, then known as the &quot;White Star Dock&quot; had been specially constructed to accommodate the new &quot;Olympic&quot;-class liners, and had opened in 1911.

Her maiden voyage commenced on 14 June 1911 from Southampton, calling at Cherbourg and Queenstown, and reaching New York City on 21 June, with 1,313 passengers on board (489 first class, 263 second class and 561 third class). The maiden voyage was captained by Edward Smith who would perish the following year in the &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster. Designer Thomas Andrews was present for the passage to New York and return, along with a number of engineers with Bruce Ismay and Harland and Wolff&#x27;s &quot;Guarantee Group&quot; who were also aboard for them to spot any problems or areas for improvement. Andrews would also lose his life in the &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster.

As the largest ship in the world, and the first in a new class of superliners, &quot;Olympic&quot;″s maiden voyage attracted considerable worldwide attention from the press and public. Following her arrival in New York, &quot;Olympic&quot; was opened up to the public and received over 8,000 visitors. More than 10,000 spectators watched her depart from New York harbour, for her first return trip. There were 2,301 passengers on board for the return voyage (731 first class, 495 second class and 1,075 third class). During her third crossing, an observer of the Cunard Line was on board, in search of ideas for their new ship then under construction, the .

=== &quot;Hawke&quot; collision ===
&quot;Olympic&quot;″s first major mishap occurred on her fifth voyage on 20 September 1911, when she collided with the British cruiser . The collision took place as &quot;Olympic&quot; and &quot;Hawke&quot; were running parallel to each other through the Solent. As &quot;Olympic&quot; turned to starboard, the wide radius of her turn took the commander of &quot;Hawke&quot; by surprise, and he was unable to take sufficient avoiding action. &quot;Hawke&quot;″s bow, which had been designed to sink ships by ramming them, collided with &quot;Olympic&quot;″s starboard side near the stern, tearing two large holes in &quot;Olympic&quot;″s hull, above and below the waterline, resulting in the flooding of two of her watertight compartments and a twisted propeller shaft. &quot;Olympic&quot; settled slightly by the stern, but in spite of the damage was able to return to Southampton under her own power; no one was killed or seriously injured. HMS &quot;Hawke&quot; suffered severe damage to her bow and nearly capsized; Hawke was repaired, but sunk by the German U-boat in October 1914.

Captain Edward Smith was in command of &quot;Olympic&quot; at the time of the incident. Two crew members, stewardess Violet Jessop and stoker Arthur John Priest, survived not only the collision with &quot;Hawke&quot; but also the later sinking of &quot;Titanic&quot; and the 1916 sinking of &quot;Britannic&quot;, the third ship of the class.

At the subsequent inquiry the Royal Navy blamed &quot;Olympic&quot; for the incident, alleging that her large displacement generated a suction that pulled &quot;Hawke&quot; into her side. The &quot;Hawke&quot; incident was a financial disaster for &quot;Olympic&quot;″s operator. A legal argument ensued which decided that the blame for the incident lay with &quot;Olympic&quot; and, although the ship was technically under the control of the harbour pilot, the White Star Line was faced with large legal bills and the cost of repairing the ship, and keeping her out of revenue service made matters worse. However, the fact that &quot;Olympic&quot; endured such a serious collision and stayed afloat appeared to vindicate the design of the &quot;Olympic&quot;-class liners, and reinforced their &quot;unsinkable&quot; reputation.

It took two weeks for the damage to &quot;Olympic&quot; to be patched up sufficiently to allow her to return to Belfast for permanent repairs, which took just over six weeks to complete. To expedite repairs, Harland and Wolff was obliged to replace &quot;Olympic&quot;″s damaged propeller shaft with one from &quot;Titanic&quot;, delaying the latter&#x27;s completion. By 20 November 1911 &quot;Olympic&quot; was back in service, but, on 24 February 1912, suffered another setback when she lost a propeller blade on an eastbound voyage from New York, and once again returned to her builder for repairs. To return her to service as soon as possible, Harland &amp; Wolff again had to pull resources from &quot;Titanic&quot;, delaying her maiden voyage by three weeks, from 20 March to 10 April 1912.

=== &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster ===
On 14 April 1912, &quot;Olympic&quot;, now under the command of Herbert James Haddock, was on a return trip from New York. Wireless operator Ernest James Moore received the distress call from &quot;Titanic&quot;, when she was approximately 505 miles west by south of &quot;Titanic&quot;″s location. Haddock calculated a new course, ordered the ship&#x27;s engines to be set to full power and headed to assist in the rescue.

When &quot;Olympic&quot; was about away from &quot;Titanic&quot;″s last known position, she received a message from Captain Rostron of Cunard&#x27;s , which had arrived at the scene. Rostron explained that &quot;Olympic&quot; continuing on course to &quot;Titanic&quot; would gain nothing, as &quot;All boats accounted for. About 675 souls saved [...] Titanic foundered about 2:20 am.&quot; Rostron requested that the message be forwarded to White Star and Cunard. He said that he was returning to harbour in New York. Subsequently, the wireless room aboard &quot;Olympic&quot; operated as a clearing room for radio messages.

When &quot;Olympic&quot; offered to take on the survivors, she was turned down by Rostron under order from Ismay, who was concerned that asking the survivors to board a virtual mirror-image of &quot;Titanic&quot; would cause them distress. &quot;Olympic&quot; then resumed her voyage to Southampton, with all concerts cancelled as a mark of respect, arriving on 21 April.

Over the next few months, &quot;Olympic&quot; assisted with both the American and British inquiries into the disaster. Deputations from both inquiries inspected &quot;Olympic&quot;″s lifeboats, watertight doors and bulkheads and other equipment which were identical to those on &quot;Titanic&quot;. Sea tests were performed for the British enquiry in May 1912, to establish how quickly the ship could turn two points at various speeds, to approximate how long it would have taken &quot;Titanic&quot; to turn after the iceberg was sighted.

=== 1912 strike===
&quot;Olympic&quot;, like &quot;Titanic&quot;, did not carry enough lifeboats for everyone on board, and so was hurriedly equipped with additional, second-hand collapsible lifeboats following her return to Britain. Towards the end of April 1912, as she was about to sail from Southampton to New York, 284 of the ship&#x27;s firemen went on strike, for fear that the ship&#x27;s new collapsible lifeboats were not seaworthy. 100 non-union crew were hastily hired from Southampton as replacements, with more being hired from Liverpool.

The 40 collapsible lifeboats were transferred from troopships and put on &quot;Olympic&quot;, and many were rotten and would not open. The crewmen, instead, sent a request to the Southampton manager of the White Star Line that the collapsible boats be replaced by wooden lifeboats; the manager replied that this was impossible and that the collapsible boats had been passed as seaworthy by a Board of Trade inspector. The men were not satisfied and ceased work in protest.

On 25 April, a deputation of strikers witnessed a test of four of the collapsible boats. One was unseaworthy and the deputation said that it was prepared to recommend the men return to work if the boats were replaced. However, the strikers now objected to the non-union strikebreaker crew which had come on board, and demanded that they be dismissed, which the White Star Line refused. Fifty-four sailors then left the ship, objecting to the non-union crew who they claimed were unqualified and therefore dangerous, and refused to sail with them. This led to the scheduled sailing being cancelled.

All 54 sailors were arrested on a charge of mutiny when they went ashore. On 4 May 1912, Portsmouth magistrates found the charges against the mutineers were proven, but discharged them without imprisonment or fine, due to the special circumstances of the case. Fearing that public opinion would be on the side of the strikers, the White Star Line let them return to work and &quot;Olympic&quot; sailed on 15 May.

=== Post-&quot;Titanic&quot; refit ===

On 9 October 1912, White Star withdrew &quot;Olympic&quot; from service and returned her to her builders at Belfast to have modifications added to incorporate lessons learned from the &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster six months prior, and improve safety. The number of lifeboats carried by &quot;Olympic&quot; was increased from twenty to sixty-eight, and extra davits were installed along the boat deck to accommodate them. An inner watertight skin was also constructed in the boiler and engine rooms, which created a double hull. Five of the watertight bulkheads were extended up to B-Deck, extending to the entire height of the hull. This corrected a flaw in the original design, in which the bulkheads only rose up as far as E or D-Deck, a short distance above the waterline. This flaw had been exposed during &quot;Titanic&quot;″s sinking, where water spilled over the top of the bulkheads as the ship sank and flooded subsequent compartments. In addition, an extra bulkhead was added to subdivide the electrical dynamo room, bringing the total number of watertight compartments to seventeen. Improvements were also made to the ship&#x27;s pumping apparatus. These modifications meant that &quot;Olympic&quot; could survive a collision similar to that of &quot;Titanic&quot;, in that her first six compartments could be breached and the ship could remain afloat.

At the same time, &quot;Olympic&quot;″s B Deck underwent a refit, which included extra cabins in place of the covered promenade, more private bathing facilities, an enlarged &quot;Á La Carte&quot; restaurant, and a &quot;Café Parisien&quot; (another addition that had proved popular on &quot;Titanic&quot;) was added, offering another dining option to first class passengers. With these changes (and a second refit in 1919 after the war), &quot;Olympic&quot;″s gross register tonnage rose to 46,439 tons, 111 tons more than &quot;Titanic&quot;″s.

In March 1913, &quot;Olympic&quot; returned to service and briefly regained the title of largest ocean liner in the world, until the German liner entered passenger service in June 1913. Following her refit, &quot;Olympic&quot; was marketed as the &quot;new&quot; &quot;Olympic&quot; and her improved safety features were featured prominently in advertisements. The ship experienced a short period of tranquility despite a storm in 1914 that broke some of the First Class windows and injured some passengers.

=== First World War ===
On 4 August 1914, Britain entered the First World War. &quot;Olympic&quot; initially remained in commercial service under Captain Herbert James Haddock. As a wartime measure, &quot;Olympic&quot; was painted in a grey colour scheme, portholes were blocked, and lights on deck were turned off to make the ship less visible. The schedule was hastily altered to terminate at Liverpool rather than Southampton, and this was later altered again to Glasgow.

The first few wartime voyages were packed with Americans trapped in Europe, eager to return home; the eastbound journeys carried few passengers. By mid-October, bookings had fallen sharply as the threat from German U-boats became increasingly serious, and White Star Line decided to withdraw &quot;Olympic&quot; from commercial service. On 21 October 1914, she left New York for Glasgow on her last commercial voyage of the war, though carrying only 153 passengers.

==== &quot;Audacious&quot; incident 1914 ====
On the sixth day of her voyage, 27 October, as &quot;Olympic&quot; passed near Lough Swilly off the north coast of Ireland, she received distress signals from the battleship , which had struck a mine off Tory Island and was taking on water. HMS &quot;Liverpool&quot; was in the company of &quot;Audacious&quot;.

&quot;Olympic&quot; took off 250 of &quot;Audacious&quot;″s crew, then the destroyer managed to attach a tow cable between &quot;Audacious&quot; and &quot;Olympic&quot; and they headed west for Lough Swilly. However, the cable parted after &quot;Audacious&quot;″s steering gear failed. A second attempt was made to tow the warship, but the cable became tangled in &#x27;s propellers and was severed. A third attempt was tried but also failed when the cable gave way. By 17:00 the &quot;Audacious&quot;″s quarterdeck was awash and it was decided to evacuate the remaining crew members to &quot;Olympic&quot; and &quot;Liverpool&quot;, and at 20:55 there was an explosion aboard &quot;Audacious&quot; and she sank.

Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, Commander of the Home Fleet, was anxious to suppress the news of the sinking of &quot;Audacious&quot;, for fear of the demoralising effect it could have on the British public, so he ordered &quot;Olympic&quot; to be held in custody at Lough Swilly. No communications were permitted and passengers were not allowed to leave the ship. The only people departing her were the crew of &quot;Audacious&quot; and Chief Surgeon John Beaumont, who was transferring to . Steel tycoon Charles M. Schwab, who was travelling aboard the liner, sent word to Jellicoe that he had urgent business in London with the Admiralty, and Jellicoe agreed to release Schwab if he remained silent about the fate of &quot;Audacious&quot;. Finally, on 2 November, &quot;Olympic&quot; was allowed to go to Belfast where the passengers disembarked.

==== Naval service ====
Following &quot;Olympic&quot;″s return to Britain, the White Star Line intended to lay her up in Belfast until the war was over, but in May 1915 she was requisitioned by the Admiralty, to be used as a troop transport, along with the Cunard liners and . The Admiralty had initially been reluctant to use large ocean liners as troop transports because of their vulnerability to enemy attack; however, a shortage of ships gave them little choice. At the same time, &quot;Olympic&quot;″s other sister ship &quot;Britannic&quot;, which had not yet been completed, was requisitioned as a hospital ship. Operating in that role she would strike a German naval mine and sink in the Aegean Sea on 21 November 1916.

Stripped of her peacetime fittings and now armed with 12-pounders and 4.7-inch guns, &quot;Olympic&quot; was converted to a troopship, with the capacity to transport up to 6,000 troops. On 24 September 1915 the newly designated HMT (Hired Military Transport) 2810, now under the command of Bertram Fox Hayes, left Liverpool carrying 6,000 soldiers to Moudros, Greece for the Gallipoli Campaign. On 1 October lifeboats from the French ship &quot;Provincia&quot; which had been sunk by a U-boat that morning off Cape Matapan were sighted and 34 survivors rescued by &quot;Olympic&quot;. Hayes was criticised for this action by the British Admiralty, who accused him of putting the ship in danger by stopping her in waters where enemy U-boats were active. The ship&#x27;s speed was considered to be her best defence against U-boat attack, and such a large ship stopped would have made an unmissable target. However, the French Vice-Admiral Louis Dartige du Fournet took a different view, and awarded Hayes with the Gold Medal of Honour. &quot;Olympic&quot; made several more trooping journeys to the Mediterranean until early 1916, when the Gallipoli Campaign was abandoned.
In 1916, considerations were made to use &quot;Olympic&quot; to transport troops to India via the Cape of Good Hope. However, on investigation it was decided that the ship was unsuitable for this role, because the coal bunkers, which had been designed for transatlantic runs, lacked the capacity for such a long journey at a reasonable speed. Instead, from 1916 to 1917, &quot;Olympic&quot; was chartered by the Canadian Government to transport troops from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Britain. In 1917 she gained 6-inch guns and was painted with a dazzle camouflage scheme to make it more difficult for observers to estimate her speed and heading. Her dazzle colours were brown, dark blue, light blue, and white. Her many visits to Halifax Harbour carrying Canadian troops safely overseas, and back home after the war at Pier 2, made her a favourite symbol in the city of Halifax. Noted Group of Seven artist Arthur Lismer made several paintings of her in Halifax. A large dance hall, the &quot;Olympic Gardens&quot; was also named in her honour.

After the United States declared war on Germany in 1917, &quot;Olympic&quot; transported thousands of American troops to Britain.

====Sinking of &quot;U-103&quot;====

In the early hours of 12 May 1918, while en route for France in the English Channel with U.S. troops under the command of Captain Hayes, &quot;Olympic&quot; sighted a surfaced U-boat ahead. &quot;Olympic&quot;″s gunners opened fire at once, and the ship turned to ram the submarine, which immediately crash dived to and turned to a parallel course. Almost immediately afterwards &quot;Olympic&quot; struck the submarine just aft of her conning tower with her port propeller slicing through &#x27;s pressure hull. The crew of &quot;U-103&quot; blew her ballast tanks, scuttled and abandoned the submarine. &quot;Olympic&quot; did not stop to pick up survivors, but continued on to Cherbourg. Meanwhile, had sighted a distress flare and picked up 31 survivors from &quot;U-103&quot;. &quot;Olympic&quot; returned to Southampton with at least two hull plates dented and her prow twisted to one side, but not breached.

It was subsequently discovered that &quot;U-103&quot; had been preparing to torpedo &quot;Olympic&quot; when she was sighted, but the crew were not able to flood the two stern torpedo tubes. For his service, Captain Hayes was awarded the DSO. Some American soldiers on board paid for a plaque to be placed in one of &quot;Olympic&quot;″s lounges to commemorate the event, it read:

This tablet presented by the 59th Regiment United States Infantry commemorates the sinking of the German submarine U103 by &quot;Olympic&quot; on May 12th 1918 in latitude 49 degrees 16 minutes north longitude 4 degrees 51 minutes west on the voyage from New York to Southampton with American troops... 

During the war, &quot;Olympic&quot; is reported to have carried up to 201,000 troops and other personnel, burning 347,000 tons of coal and travelling about . &quot;Olympic&quot;″s war service earned her the nickname &quot;Old Reliable&quot;. Her captain was knighted in 1919 for &quot;valuable services in connection with the transport of troops&quot;.

&quot;Olympic&quot; holds the unofficial award of being the only passenger liner to ram - and sink - a German U-Boat during the First World War.

=== Post-war ===
In August 1919 &quot;Olympic&quot; returned to Belfast for restoration to civilian service. The interiors were modernised and the boilers were converted to oil firing rather than coal burning. This modification would reduce the refuelling time from days to 5 or 6 hours; it also gave a steadier engine R.P.M and allowed the engine room personnel to be reduced from 350 to 60 people. During the conversion work and drydocking, a dent with a crack at the centre was discovered below her waterline which was later concluded to have been caused by a torpedo that had failed to detonate. The historian Mark Chirnside concluded that the faulty torpedo had been fired by the U-boat SM &quot;U-53&quot; on 4 September 1918, while &quot;Olympic&quot; was in the English Channel.
&quot;Olympic&quot; emerged from refit with an increased tonnage of 46,439, allowing her to retain her claim to the title of largest British-built liner afloat, although the Cunard Line″s was slightly longer. On 25 June 1920 she returned to passenger service, on one voyage that year carrying 2,249 passengers, and carried more than 28,000 passengers throughout the second half of 1920. &quot;Olympic&quot; transported a record 38,000 passengers during 1921, which proved to be the peak year of her career. With the loss of the &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;Britannic&quot;, &quot;Olympic&quot; initially lacked any suitable running mates for the express service; however, in 1922 White Star obtained two former German liners, and , which had been given to Britain as war reparations. These joined &quot;Olympic&quot; as running mates, operating successfully until the Great Depression reduced demand after 1930.

During the 1920s, &quot;Olympic&quot; remained a popular and fashionable ship, and often attracted the rich and famous of the day; Marie Curie, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks, and Prince Edward, then Prince of Wales, were among the celebrities that she carried. Prince Edward and Captain Howarth were filmed on the bridge of &quot;Olympic&quot; for Pathé News. According to his autobiography, and confirmed by US Immigration records, Cary Grant, then 16-year-old Archibald Leach, first set sail to New York on &quot;Olympic&quot; on 21 July 1920 on the same voyage on which Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford were celebrating their honeymoon. One of the attractions of &quot;Olympic&quot; was that she was nearly identical to &quot;Titanic&quot;, and many passengers sailed on &quot;Olympic&quot; as a way of vicariously experiencing the voyage of her sister ship.
On 22 March 1924, &quot;Olympic&quot; was involved in another collision with a ship, this time at New York. As &quot;Olympic&quot; was reversing from her berth at New York harbour, her stern collided with the smaller liner &quot;Fort St George&quot;, which had crossed into her path. The collision caused extensive damage to the smaller ship. At first it appeared that &quot;Olympic&quot; had sustained only minor damage, but it was later revealed that her sternpost had been fractured, necessitating the replacement of her entire stern frame.

On 7 June Lord Pirrie died on a business trip aboard in the Caribbean off Cuba. On 13 June &quot;&quot; reached New York; UK ships in the port of New York lowered their flags to half-mast; and Pirrie&#x27;s body was transferred to &quot;Olympic&quot; to be repatriated to the UK.
Changes in immigration laws in the United States in the 1920s greatly restricted the number of immigrants allowed to enter. The law limited the number of immigrants to about 160,000 per year in 1924. This led to a major reduction in the immigrant trade for the shipping lines, forcing them to cater to the tourist trade to survive. At the turn of 1927–28, &quot;Olympic&quot; was converted to carry tourist third cabin passengers as well as first, second and third class. Tourist third cabin was an attempt to attract travellers who desired comfort without the accompanying high ticket price. New public rooms were constructed for this class, although tourist third cabin and second class would merge to become &#x27;tourist&#x27; by late 1931.

A year later, &quot;Olympic&quot;″s first-class cabins were again improved by adding more bathrooms, a dance floor was fitted in the enlarged first-class dining saloon, and a number of new suites with private facilities were installed forward on B deck. More improvements would follow in a later refit, but 1929 saw &quot;Olympic&quot;″s best average passenger lists since 1925.

On 18 November 1929, as &quot;Olympic&quot; was travelling westbound near to &quot;Titanic&quot;″s last known position, the ship suddenly started to vibrate violently, and the vibrations continued for two minutes. It was later determined that this had been caused by the 1929 Grand Banks earthquake.

==== Last years ====
The shipping trade was badly affected by the Great Depression. Until 1930 there had generally been around one million passengers a year on the transatlantic route, but by 1934 this had dropped by more than half. Furthermore, by the early 1930s, increased competition emerged, in the form of a new generation of larger and faster liners such as Germany&#x27;s and , Italy&#x27;s and France&#x27;s , and the remaining passengers tended to prefer the more up-to-date ships. &quot;Olympic&quot; had averaged around 1,000 passengers per journey until 1930, but this declined by more than half by 1932.

&quot;Olympic&quot;″s running mate was withdrawn from the transatlantic route as early as 1932, leaving only &quot;Olympic&quot; and maintaining White Star Line&#x27;s Southampton-New York service, although this was occasionally augmented during the summer months by either or . During slack periods in the summer, &quot;Olympic&quot; and fleet mate &quot;Majestic&quot; were employed in summer recreational cruises from New York to Pier 21 in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

At the end of 1932, with passenger traffic in decline, &quot;Olympic&quot; went for an overhaul and refit that took four months. She returned to service on 5 March 1933 described by her owners as &quot;looking like new.&quot; Her engines were performing at their best and she repeatedly recorded speeds in excess of , despite averaging less than that in regular transatlantic service. Passenger capacities were given as 618 first class, 447 tourist class and only 382 third class after the decline of the immigrant trade.

Despite this, during 1933 and 1934, &quot;Olympic&quot; ran at a net operating loss for the first time. 1933 was &quot;Olympic&quot;″s worst year of business – carrying just over 9,000 passengers in total. Passenger numbers rose slightly in 1934, but many crossings still lost money.

=== Nantucket lightship collision ===
In 1934, &quot;Olympic&quot; again struck another ship. The approaches to New York were marked by lightships and &quot;Olympic&quot;, like other liners, had been known to pass close by these vessels. On 15 May 1934 (11:06 am), &quot;Olympic&quot;, inbound in heavy fog, was homing in on the radio beacon of Nantucket Lightship &quot;LV-117&quot;. Now under the command of Captain John W. Binks, the ship failed to turn in time and sliced through the smaller vessel, which broke apart and sank. Four of the lightship&#x27;s crew went down with the vessel and seven were rescued, of whom three died of their injuries, seven fatalities out of a crew of eleven. The lightship&#x27;s surviving crew and &quot;Olympic&quot;″s captain were interviewed soon after reaching shore. One crewman said it all happened so quickly that they did not know how it happened. &quot;Olympic&quot; reacted quickly lowering boats to rescue the crew, which was confirmed by an injured crewman.

=== Retirement ===

In 1934, the White Star Line merged with the Cunard Line at the instigation of the British government, to form Cunard White Star. This merger allowed funds to be granted for the completion of the future and . When completed, these two new ships would handle Cunard White Star&#x27;s express service; so their fleet of older liners became redundant and were gradually retired.
&quot;Olympic&quot; was withdrawn from the transatlantic service, and left New York for the last time on 5 April 1935, returning to Britain to be laid up in Southampton. The new company considered using her for summer cruises for a short while, but this idea was abandoned and she was put up for sale. Among the potential buyers was a syndicate who proposed to turn her into a floating hotel off the south coast of France, but this came to nothing.

After being laid up for five months alongside her former rival , she was sold to Sir John Jarvis – Member of Parliament – for £97,500, to be partially demolished at Jarrow to provide work for the depressed region. On 11 October 1935, &quot;Olympic&quot; left Southampton for the last time and arrived in Jarrow two days later. The scrapping began after the ship&#x27;s fittings were auctioned off. Between 1935 and 1937, &quot;Olympic&quot;″s superstructure was demolished, and then on 19 September 1937, her hull was towed to Thos. W. Ward&#x27;s yard at Inverkeithing for final demolition which was finished by late 1937. At that time, the ship&#x27;s chief engineer commented, &quot;I could understand the necessity if the &#x27;Old Lady&#x27; had lost her efficiency, but the engines are as sound as they ever were&quot;.

By the time of her retirement, &quot;Olympic&quot; had completed 257 round trips across the Atlantic, transporting 430,000 passengers on her commercial voyages, travelling 1.8 million miles.

== Artefacts==
&quot;Olympic&quot;″s fittings were auctioned off before the scrapping commenced.

The fittings of the first-class lounge and part of the aft grand staircase can be found in the White Swan Hotel, in Alnwick, Northumberland, England. A variety of panelling, light fixtures, flooring, doors, and windows from &quot;Olympic&quot; were installed in a paint factory in Haltwhistle, Northumberland, until they were auctioned in 2004. One suite at Sparth House Hotel, Clayton-le-Moors, Lancashire has the furniture from one of the staterooms, including light fitting, sink, wardrobes and fireplace. The crystal and ormolu electrolier from the lounge is installed in the Cutlers&#x27; Hall in Sheffield. Some of the timber panelling was used in the extension (completed in 1937) of St John the Baptist&#x27;s Catholic Church in Padiham, Lancashire.

In 2000, Celebrity Cruises purchased some of &quot;Olympic&quot;″s original wooden panels to create the &quot;RMS &quot;Olympic&quot; Restaurant&quot; on board their new cruise ship, Celebrity Millennium. According to the cruise line, this panelling had lined &quot;Olympic&quot;″s À la Carte restaurant.

&quot;Olympic&quot;″s bridge bell is on display at the Titanic Historical Society in Indian Orchard, Springfield, Massachusetts.

The clock depicting &quot;Honour and Glory Crowning Time&quot; from &quot;Olympic&quot;″s grand staircase is on display at Southampton&#x27;s SeaCity Museum.
In 1912, a Steinway Vertegrand upright piano No.157550 with a quartered walnut case left the Steinway Hamburg factory unfinished and was sent to its London branch. In 1913, it was decorated by Harland &amp; Wolff&#x27;s interior decoration company Aldam Heaton &amp; Co with carvings and gold accents. The piano was first placed in the aft starboard corner in the first-class reception room.

In 2017, the old billiard hall at 44 Priestpopple, Hexham, Northumberland, was demolished. During an archaeological excavation on the demolition site by AAG Archaeology, one of the &quot;Olympic&quot;″s chairs was recovered. The fittings from &quot;Olympic&quot; were auctioned off over ten days in November 1935 at the Palmers Works in Jarrow, the billiard hall opened in 1936.

== Identification ==
&quot;Olympic&quot;″s UK official number was 131346. Official numbers were issued by individual flag states; they should not be confused with IMO numbers.

Until 1933 &quot;Olympic&quot;″s code letters were HSRP and her wireless telegraphy call sign was MKC. In 1930 new four-letter call signs superseded three-letter ones, and in 1934 they also superseded code letters. &quot;Olympic&quot;″s new call sign was GLSQ.

<text>The D1G reactor was a prototype naval reactor designed for the United States Navy to provide electricity generation and propulsion on warships. The D1G designation stands for:

* D = Destroyer platform
* 1 = First generation core designed by the contractor
* G = General Electric was the contracted designer

This prototype nuclear reactor was constructed for the United States Department of Energy&#x27;s Office of Naval Reactors as part of the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program. The reactor was built by General Electric and operated by the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory at the Kesselring Site Operation in West Milton, New York. It was used for testing components and as a training tool for the Nuclear Power Training Unit. The reactor operated from 1962 to 1996, when it was shut down in March of that year. It was later defuelled, with the pressure vessel eventually removed in 2002.

The containment structure — which housed both the primary (nuclear reactor) and secondary (steam plant) systems — is referred to as the &quot;DIG-ball&quot; due to its unique shape: a Horton sphere. The sphere was originally constructed by Chicago Bridge and Iron Works to house the liquid metal cooled reactor of , with the dome designed to contain a liquid sodium explosion.

In January 2022, a radioactive tank that was used to support the D1G reactor was transported from West Milton, New York to Wampum, Pennsylvania for disassembly. The load was 213 feet long and weighed 294 tons.

<text>The D2G reactor was a naval reactor used by the United States Navy from 1962 to provide propulsion and electricity generation on warships. Ships powered by the reactor were decommissioned at around the end of the 20th century. The D2G designation stands for:

* D = Destroyer platform
* 2 = Second generation core designed by the contractor
* G = General Electric was the contracted designer

== History ==
Two of these nuclear reactors were installed on each of the &quot;Bainbridge&quot;, &quot;Truxtun&quot;, &quot;California&quot;, and &quot;Virginia&quot; classes of guided missile cruisers. The only nuclear-powered cruiser in the United States Navy not equipped with a D2G reactor was the world&#x27;s first nuclear cruiser, the USS &quot;Long Beach&quot; (CGN-9), which used two C1W reactors.

It is known that USS &quot;Bainbridge&quot;&#x27;s reactors were refueled three times, and USS &quot;Truxtun&quot;&#x27;s were refueled twice.

==Operation==
Each D2G reactor was rated for a maximum thermal output of , with two steam turbines which drove two shafts, each generating between . Each reactor was long, wide, and weighed . One reactor was located in the aft of the hull, the other in the fore. The reactors of the &quot;California&quot; class ships were replaced by D2W reactors in the early 1990s.

<text>The Great Dane is a German breed of large mastiff-sighthound, which descends from hunting dogs of the Middle Ages used to hunt bears, wild boar, and deer. They were also used as guardian dogs of German nobility. It is one of the two largest dog breeds in the world, along with the Irish Wolfhound.

== History ==

In the sixteenth century the nobility in many countries of Europe imported strong, long-legged dogs of different sizes and phenotypes, some of mastiff or greyhound type, from England and Ireland. These dogs were called &quot;Englische Docke&quot; or &quot;Englische Tocke&quot; – later written and spelled: &quot;Dogge&quot; – or &quot;Englischer Hund&quot; in Germany. The name simply meant &quot;English dog&quot;. Since then, the English word &quot;dog&quot; has come to be associated with a molossoid dog in Germany and France. These dogs were bred in the courts of German nobility, independent of the English methods, since the start of the 17th century.

The dogs were used for hunting bear, boar, and deer at princely courts, with the favorites staying in the bedchambers of their lords at night. These &quot;Kammerhunde&quot; (chamber dogs) were outfitted with ornate collars, and helped to protect the sleeping princes from assassins.

While hunting boar or bears, the &quot;Englische Dogge&quot; was a catch dog used after the other hunting dogs to seize the bear or boar and hold it in place until the huntsman was able to kill it. When the hunting customs changed, particularly because of the use of firearms, many of the involved dog types disappeared. The &quot;Englische Dogge&quot; became rare, and was kept only as a dog of hobby or luxury.

=== Name change ===
In 1878, a committee was formed in Berlin which changed the name of the &quot;Englische Dogge&quot; (English mastiff derivatives) to &quot;Deutsche Dogge&quot; (German mastiff), this being the Great Dane. This laid the foundations from which the breed was developed. During the 19th century, the dog was known as a &quot;German boarhound&quot; in English-speaking countries. Some German breeders tried to introduce the names &quot;German Dogge&quot; and &quot;German Mastiff&quot; on the English market, because they believed the breed should be marketed as a dog of luxury and not as a working dog. However, due to the increasing Geopolitical tensions between Germany and France and Britain, the dog later became referred to as a &quot;Great Dane&quot;, a literal translation from the new name given to it by the French, &quot;Grand Danois&quot;, even though the breed has no known connection to Denmark. In Germany, it remains known as &quot;Deutsche Dogge.&quot; In the Scandinavian languages, the French name and pronunciation are used.

In the late nineteenth century the dogs were sometimes known as Reichshund (&#x27;Empire dog&#x27;) because of their association with the &quot;Reichskanzler&quot;, Otto von Bismarck.

== Description ==

The Great Dane is an extremely large domestic dog of mastiff-sighthound type known for its big size. It is often dubbed the &quot;Apollo of dogs&quot;.

As described by the American Kennel Club:

The Great Dane combines, in its regal appearance, strength, and elegance with great size and a powerful, well-formed, smoothly muscled body. It is one of the giant working breeds, but is unique in that its general conformation must be so well balanced that it never appears clumsy, and shall move with a long reach and powerful drive. The Great Dane is a short-haired breed with a strong, galloping figure. In the ratio between length and height, the Great Dane should be square. The male dog should not be less than at the shoulders, a female . Danes under minimum height are disqualified. Over the years, the tallest living dog has typically been a Great Dane. Previous record holders include Gibson, Titan, and George; however, the current record holder is a black Great Dane named Zeus that stood at the shoulder before his death in September 2014. He was also the tallest dog on record (according to Guinness World Records), beating the previous holder, the aforementioned George that stood at the shoulder.

The UK and New Zealand Kennel Clubs specify the minimum weight for a Great Dane over 18 months of age, as for males, for females. The American Kennel Club dropped the minimum weight requirement from its standard. The male should appear more massive throughout than the female, with a larger frame and heavier bone.

Great Danes have naturally floppy, triangular ears. In the past, when Great Danes were commonly used to hunt boars, cropping of the ears was performed to make injuries to the dogs&#x27; ears less likely during hunts. Now that Danes are primarily companion animals, cropping is sometimes still done for traditional and cosmetic reasons. In the 1930s when Great Danes had their ears cropped, after the surgery, two devices called Easter bonnets were fitted to their ears to make them stand up. Today, the practice is still common in the United States, but much less common in Europe. In some European countries such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, Denmark, and Germany, and parts of Australia and New Zealand, the practice is banned or controlled to only be performed by veterinary surgeons.

The dogs are generally not unduly aggressive towards people and other animals.

=== Coat ===

According to the breed standard, Great Danes have six to seven (depending on the standard) show-acceptable coat colours:
* Fawn and brindle
**Fawn: The colour is yellow-gold with a black mask. Black should appear on the eye rims and eyebrows and may appear on the ears.
**Brindle: The colour is fawn and black in a chevron striped pattern. Often, they are also referred to as having a striped pattern.
* Black, harlequin, grey merle and mantle
**Black: The colour is a glossy black. White markings on the chest and toes are not desirable and considered faults.
**Harlequin: The base colour is pure white with torn black patches irregularly distributed over the entire body; a pure white neck is preferred. The black patches should never be large enough to give the appearance of a blanket, nor so small as to give a stippled or dappled effect. Eligible, but less desirable, are a few small patches of grey that is consistent with a merle marking, or a white base with single black hairs showing through, which tend to give a salt and pepper or dirty effect. Merlequin, a white coat with grey patches instead of black, is a disqualification.
***Grey merle (&quot;Grautiger&quot;) Great Danes are acceptable in conformation shows under the FCI. This color was previously a disqualifying fault, but the fault was deleted in a new breed standard in 2012 to provide a wider gene pool and because the grey merle gene can produce a correct harlequin coat. Their status is that they are &quot;neither desirable nor to be disqualified&quot;. Consequently, this colour must never obtain the highest grading at dog shows.
**Mantle (in some countries referred to as Boston due to the similar colouration and pattern as a Boston Terrier): The colour is black and white with a solid black blanket extending over the body; black skull with white muzzle; white blaze is optional; whole white collar preferred; a white chest; white on part or whole of forelegs and hind legs; white tipped black tail. A small white marking in the black blanket is acceptable, as is a break in the white collar.
* Blue and blue brindle
**Blue: The colour is a pure steel blue. White markings at the chest and feet are permitted - never with a fawn nuance or blackish-blue colour.
**Blue brindle: This is a brindle coat with a blue-gray background and darker brindle striping.

== Health ==
Great Danes, like most giant dogs, have a fast metabolism. This results in more energy and food consumption per pound of dog than in small breeds. They have some health problems that are common to large breeds, including bloat (gastric dilatation volvulus).

Nutrition plays a role in this breed&#x27;s health. Bloat, or gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV), is the greatest killer of Great Danes. To avoid bloat, a rest period of 40 minutes to one hour after meals is recommended before exercise.

A 2024 UK study found the average life expectancy of the breed to be 10.6 years, compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds. A 2005 Swedish study of insurance records found 83% of Great Danes died by the age of 10, higher than the overall rate of 35% of dogs dying by the age of 10.

Dilated cardiomyopathy and many congenital heart diseases are also commonly found in the Great Dane, leading to its nickname: the heartbreak breed, in conjunction with its shorter lifespan. Great Danes also may carry the merle gene, which is part of the genetic makeup that creates the harlequin coloring. The merle gene is an incomplete dominant, meaning only one copy of the gene is needed to show the merle coloring; two merle genes produce excessive white markings and many health issues such as deafness, blindness, or other debilitating ocular issues. Great Danes can also develop wobbler disease, a condition affecting the vertebral column. Since these dogs grow at a rapid rate, the bones in their vertebrae can push up against the spinal cord and cause weakness in the legs. This can be treated with surgery or may heal itself over time.

Like many larger breeds, Great Danes are at particular risk for hip dysplasia.

== Cultural significance ==

Animation
* Animation designer Iwao Takamoto based the character Scooby-Doo on a Great Dane. He derived his design from sketches given to him by a Hanna-Barbera employee who bred Danes, and then endeavoured to make Scooby the opposite of a perfect pedigree, with a longer tail, bowed legs, small chin and a sloping back.

Crime
* On 24 October 1975, Rinka, a Great Dane belonging to Norman Scott, was shot in a bungled attempt to murder Scott, in what became known as the Thorpe affair. In 1996, Scott Freeman and Barrie Penrose published &quot;Rinkagate: Rise and Fall of Jeremy Thorpe&quot;.

Mascots
* The Great Dane was named the state dog of Pennsylvania in 1965 and the University of Iowa had Great Danes, Rex I and Rex II, as mascots before the Hawkeye was chosen.
* &quot;Great Danes&quot; is the nickname of the University at Albany. Their mascot is the Great Dane.

Military
* Just Nuisance was the only dog to be officially enlisted in the Royal Navy. Done mainly as a morale booster for World War II enlisted troops, Nuisance proved to be a lasting legacy of the small Cape Town suburb of Simon&#x27;s Town.

Philosophy
* An unnamed Great Dane knocks Jean-Jacques Rousseau to the ground in &quot;Reveries of a Solitary Walker&quot;; he describes the singular feeling of peace and suspended identity that the shock of the collision brings about in him.

<text>Lionel Tertis, CBE (29 December 187622 February 1975) was an English violist. He was one of the first viola players to achieve international fame, and a noted teacher.

==Career==
Tertis was born in West Hartlepool, the son of Polish-Jewish immigrants.Tertis&#x27;s first instrument was the piano, and at thirteen he left home to earn a living as a pianist. In 1892 he had saved enough money to enter Trinity College of Music in London, where he had violin lessons under B.M. Carrodus, whilst continuing to learn the piano under R. W. Lewis for three intermittent terms. In 1895, after six months at Leipzig Conservatorium, Tertis entered the Royal Academy of Music (RAM) in London and studied the violin under Hans Wessely. In 1897, whilst at the RAM, he was encouraged by the principal, Alexander Mackenzie, to take up the viola instead. Under the additional influence of Oskar Nedbal, he did so and rapidly became one of the best-known violists of his time, touring Europe and the US as a soloist.

As Professor of Viola at the RAM (from 1900), he encouraged his colleagues and students to compose for the instrument, thereby greatly expanding its repertoire. In 1906, Tertis was temporarily in the famous Bohemian Quartet to replace the violist/composer Oskar Nedbal and later he took the viola position in the Walenn Quartet.

Composers such as Arnold Bax, Frank Bridge, Gustav Holst, Benjamin Dale, York Bowen, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Arthur Bliss, Arnold Trowell and William Walton wrote pieces for him. The Walton piece was his Viola Concerto; however, Tertis did not give the world premiere as he found it difficult to comprehend at the time; that honour went to Paul Hindemith. His pupil Bernard Shore took on the second performance at the Proms in August 1930. Tertis first performed the work a month later at the International Society for Contemporary Music festival in Liège. Over the next three years he gave five more performances of the concerto.

He owned a 1717 Montagnana from 1920 to 1937 which he found during one of his concert tours to Paris in 1920, and took a chance in acquiring. According to his memoirs, it was &quot;shown to me in an unplayable condition, without bridge, strings or fingerboard... No case was available – it was such a large instrument 17 1/8 inches – so my wife came to the rescue by wrapping it in her waterproof coat, and that is how it was taken across the English Channel.&quot; Tertis preferred a large viola to get an especially rich tone from his instrument. Knowing that some would find a 17-1/8-inch instrument too large he created his own Tertis model, which provides many of the tonal advantages of the larger instrument in a manageable 16-3/4-inch size. Tertis sold the 1717 Montagnana to his pupil Bernard Shore in 1937, who in turn passed it on to his pupil Roger Chase. 

Along with William Murdoch (piano), Albert Sammons, and Lauri Kennedy, Tertis formed the &quot;Chamber Music Players&quot;. He also encouraged and coached Sidney Griller as he worked to found the Griller Quartet in 1928, and influenced the Griller&#x27;s enthusiasm for the first Viennese School. 

In 1937, while at the height of his powers, he announced his retirement from the concert platform to concentrate on teaching. He appeared as soloist only one more time, at a special concert in 1949 to an invited audience at the RAM to help raise money for his fund to encourage the composition of music for the viola.

He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1950 New Year&#x27;s Honours.

Tertis composed several original works and also arranged many pieces not originally for the viola, such as Edward Elgar&#x27;s Cello Concerto. He was the author of a number of publications about string playing, the viola in particular, and his own life. They include &quot;Cinderella No More&quot; and &quot;My Viola and I&quot;.

Lionel Tertis died on 22 February 1975 in Wimbledon, London. He was 98 years old.

==Legacy==
The Lionel Tertis International Viola Competition was established in 1980 to honour his memory.

In February 2007 Roger Chase, along with his accompanist, pianist Michiko Otaki, initiated &quot;The Tertis Project,&quot; a series of concerts devoted to works composed for Tertis. A CD, &quot;The Tertis Tradition&quot;, was issued in 2009.

In 2015, English Heritage unveiled a blue plaque at his Wimbledon, London home.

Many fine English violists were students of Tertis, including Harry Berly, Rebecca Clarke, Eric Coates, Winifred Copperwheat, Paul Cropper, Harry Danks, C. Sidney Errington, Watson Forbes, Max Gilbert, Hope Hambourg, Raymond Jeremy, James Lockyer, Frederick Riddle, Ian Ritchie, Philip Sainton, Beryl Scawen Blunt, Bernard Shore, Gilbert Shufflebotham, Jacqueline Townshend, Maurice Ward and Lena Wood.
