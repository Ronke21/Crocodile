<text>A hernia (: hernias or herniae, from Latin, meaning &#x27;rupture&#x27;) is the abnormal exit of tissue or an organ, such as the bowel, through the wall of the cavity in which it normally resides. The term is also used for the normal development of the intestinal tract, referring to the retraction of the intestine from the extra-embryonal navel coelom into the abdomen in the healthy embryo at about 7 weeks.

Various types of hernias can occur, most commonly involving the abdomen, and specifically the groin. Groin hernias are most commonly inguinal hernias but may also be femoral hernias. Other types of hernias include hiatus, incisional, and umbilical hernias. Symptoms are present in about 66% of people with groin hernias. This may include pain or discomfort in the lower abdomen, especially with coughing, exercise, or urinating or defecating. Often, it gets worse throughout the day and improves when lying down. A bulge may appear at the site of hernia, that becomes larger when bending down.

Groin hernias occur more often on the right than left side. The main concern is bowel strangulation, where the blood supply to part of the bowel is blocked. This usually produces severe pain and tenderness in the area. Hiatus, or hiatal hernias often result in heartburn but may also cause chest pain or pain while eating.

Risk factors for the development of a hernia include smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity, pregnancy, peritoneal dialysis, collagen vascular disease and previous open appendectomy, among others. Predisposition to hernias is genetic and occur more often in certain families. Deleterious mutations causing predisposition to hernias seem to have dominant inheritance (especially for men). It is unclear if groin hernias are associated with heavy lifting. Hernias can often be diagnosed based on signs and symptoms. Occasionally, medical imaging is used to confirm the diagnosis or rule out other possible causes. The diagnosis of hiatus hernias is often done by endoscopy.

Groin hernias that do not cause symptoms in males do not need immediate surgical repair, a practice referred to as &quot;watchful waiting&quot;. However most men tend to eventually undergo groin hernia surgery due to the development of pain. For women, however, repair is generally recommended due to the higher rate of femoral hernias, which have more complications. If strangulation occurs, immediate surgery is required. Repair may be done by open surgery, laparoscopic surgery, or robotic-assisted surgery. Open surgery has the benefit of possibly being done under local anesthesia rather than general anesthesia. Laparoscopic surgery generally has less pain following the procedure. A hiatus hernia may be treated with lifestyle changes such as raising the head of the bed, weight loss and adjusting eating habits. The medications H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors may help. If the symptoms do not improve with medications, a surgery known as laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication may be an option.

Globally in 2019, there were 32.53 million prevalent cases of inguinal, femoral, and abdominal hernias, with a 95% uncertainty interval ranging from 27.71 to 37.79 million. Additionally, there were 13.02 million incident cases, with an uncertainty interval of 10.68 to 15.49 million. These figures reflect a 36.00% increase in prevalent cases and a 63.67% increase in incident cases compared to the numbers reported in 1990. About 27% of males and 3% of females develop a groin hernia at some point in their lives. Inguinal, femoral and abdominal hernias were present in 18.5 million people and resulted in 59,800 deaths in 2015. Groin hernias occur most often before the age of 1 and after the age of 50. It is not known how commonly hiatus hernias occur, with estimates in North America varying from 10% to 80%. The first known description of a hernia dates back to at least 1550 BC, in the Ebers Papyrus from Egypt.

== Pathogenesis ==
Most hernias happen when the muscles and tendons in the belly weaken or get damaged, which makes it hard for them to keep the insides in place and support the body properly. The belly and pelvis act like a container made of muscles, tendons and bones. When pressure builds up inside this container, the muscles push back to keep everything in place. If the pressure gets too high, it may cause the belly&#x27;s wall to break, leading to a hernia. Once a hernia starts, it keeps enlarging, because the tension on the wall there increases.

==Epidemiology==
About 27% of males and 3% of females develop a groin hernia at some time in their lives. In 2013 about 25 million people had a hernia. Inguinal, femoral and abdominal hernias resulted in 32,500 deaths globally in 2013 and 50,500 in 1990. Healthcare costs associated with abdominal wall hernias account for an annual expenditure of approximately 2.5 to 3 billion dollars.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms and signs vary depending on the type of hernia. By far the most common hernias develop in the abdomen when a weakness in the abdominal wall evolves into a localized hole, or &quot;defect&quot;, through which adipose tissue, or abdominal organs covered with peritoneum, may protrude. Another common hernia involves the spinal discs and causes &quot;sciatica&quot;. A hiatus hernia occurs when the stomach protrudes into the &quot;mediastinum&quot; through the esophageal opening in the diaphragm.

Hernias might manifest with pain in the area, a noticeable lump, or less specific symptoms caused by pressure on an organ stuck within the hernia, potentially leading to organ dysfunction. Typically, fatty tissue is the initial entrant into a hernia, but it might also involve an organ. Hernias are caused by a disruption or opening in the fascia, or fibrous tissue, which forms the abdominal wall. It is possible for the bulge associated with a hernia to come and go, but the defect in the tissue will persist.

Symptoms may or may not be present in some inguinal hernias. In the case of reducible hernias, a bulge in the groin or in another abdominal area can often be seen and felt. When standing, such a bulge becomes more obvious. Besides the bulge, other symptoms include pain in the groin that may also include a heavy or dragging sensation, and in men, there is sometimes pain and swelling in the scrotum around the testicular area.

Irreducible abdominal hernias or incarcerated hernias may be painful, but their most relevant symptom is that they cannot return to the abdominal cavity when pushed in. They may be chronic, although painless, and can lead to strangulation (loss of blood supply), obstruction (kinking of intestine), or both. Strangulated hernias are always painful and pain is followed by tenderness. Nausea, vomiting, or fever may occur in these cases due to bowel obstruction. Also, the hernia bulge, in this case, may turn red, purple or dark and pink.

In the diagnosis of abdominal hernias, imaging is the principal means of detecting internal diaphragmatic and other nonpalpable or unsuspected hernias. Multidetector CT (MDCT) can show with precision the anatomic site of the hernia sac, the contents of the sac, and any complications. MDCT also offers clear detail of the abdominal wall allowing wall hernias to be identified accurately.
=== Complications ===
Untreated hernia may be complicated by:
* Inflammation
* Obstruction of any lumen, such as bowel obstruction in intestinal hernias
* Strangulation
* Hydrocele of the hernial sac
* Hemorrhage
* Autoimmune problems
* Irreducibility or incarceration, in which it cannot be reduced, or pushed back into place, at least not without very much external effort. In intestinal hernias, this also substantially increases the risk of bowel obstruction and strangulation.

==Causes==
Causes of hiatus hernia vary depending on each individual. Among the multiple causes, however, are the mechanical causes which include: improper heavy weight lifting, hard coughing bouts, sharp blows to the abdomen, and incorrect posture. 

Furthermore, conditions that increase the pressure of the abdominal cavity may also cause hernias or worsen the existing ones. Some examples would be: obesity, straining during a bowel movement or urination (constipation, enlarged prostate), chronic lung disease, and also, fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites).

Also, if muscles are weakened due to poor nutrition, smoking, and overexertion, hernias are more likely to occur.

The physiological school of thought contends that in the case of inguinal hernia, the above-mentioned are only an anatomical symptom of the underlying physiological cause. They contend that the risk of hernia is due to a physiological difference between patients who have hernia and those who do not, namely the presence of aponeurotic extensions from the transversus abdominis aponeurotic arch. There isn&#x27;t any proof that being physically active will cause a hernia to get stuck or make an existing hernia worse.

Abdominal wall hernia may occur due to trauma. If this type of hernia is due to blunt trauma it is an emergency condition and could be associated with various solid organs and hollow viscus injuries.

==Diagnosis==

===Inguinal===

By far the most common hernias (up to 75% of all abdominal hernias) are inguinal hernias, which are further divided into the more common indirect inguinal hernia (2/3, depicted here), in which the inguinal canal is entered via a congenital weakness at its entrance (the internal inguinal ring), and the direct inguinal hernia type (1/3), where the hernia contents push through a weak spot in the back wall of the inguinal canal. An indirect inguinal hernia and a direct inguinal hernia can be distinguished by their positioning in relation to the inferior epigastric vessels. An indirect hernia is situated laterally to these vessels, whereas a direct hernia is positioned medially to them. Inguinal hernias are the most common type of hernia in both men and women. In some selected cases, they may require surgery.

There are special cases where a direct and indirect hernia appear together. A pantaloon hernia (or saddlebag hernia) is a combined direct and indirect hernia when the hernial sac protrudes on either side of the inferior epigastric vessels.

Additionally, though very rare, two or more indirect hernias may appear together such as in a double indirect hernia.

===Femoral===
Femoral hernias occur just below the inguinal ligament, when abdominal contents pass into the weak area at the posterior wall of the femoral canal. They can be hard to distinguish from the inguinal type (especially when ascending cephalad): however, they generally appear more rounded, and, in contrast to inguinal hernias, there is a strong female preponderance in femoral hernias. The incidence of strangulation in femoral hernias is high. Repair techniques are similar for femoral and inguinal hernia.

A &quot;Cooper&#x27;s hernia&quot; is a femoral hernia with two sacs, the first being in the femoral canal, and the second passing through a defect in the superficial fascia and appearing almost immediately beneath the skin.

===Umbilical===
They involve protrusion of intra-abdominal contents through a weakness at the site of passage of the umbilical cord through the abdominal wall. 
Umbilical hernias in adults are largely acquired, and are more frequent in obese or pregnant women. Abnormal decussation of fibers at the linea alba may be a contributing factor.

===Incisional===
An incisional hernia occurs when the defect is the result of an incompletely healed surgical wound. When these occur in median laparotomy incisions in the linea alba, they are termed ventral hernias. These occur in about 13% of people at 2 years following surgery.

===Diaphragmatic===

Higher in the abdomen, an (internal) &quot;diaphragmatic hernia&quot; results when part of the stomach or intestine protrudes into the chest cavity through a defect in the diaphragm.

A hiatus hernia is a particular variant of this type, in which the normal passageway through which the esophagus meets the stomach (esophageal hiatus) serves as a functional &quot;defect&quot;, allowing part of the stomach to (periodically) &quot;herniate&quot; into the chest. Hiatus hernias may be either &quot;sliding&quot;, in which the gastroesophageal junction itself slides through the defect into the chest, or non-sliding (also known as &quot;para-esophageal&quot;), in which case the junction remains fixed while another portion of the stomach moves up through the defect. Non-sliding or para-esophageal hernias can be dangerous as they may allow the stomach to rotate and obstruct. Repair is usually advised.

A congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a distinct problem, occurring in up to 1 in 2000 births, and requiring pediatric surgery. Intestinal organs may herniate through several parts of the diaphragm, posterolateral (in Bochdalek&#x27;s triangle (lumbocostal triangle), resulting in a Bochdalek hernia), or anteromedial-retrosternal (in the cleft of foramina of Morgagni (sternocostal triangle), resulting in a Morgagni&#x27;s hernia).

===Other hernias===
Since many organs or parts of organs can herniate through many orifices, it is very difficult to give an exhaustive list of hernias, with all synonyms and eponyms. The above article deals mostly with &quot;visceral hernias&quot;, where the herniating tissue arises within the abdominal cavity. Other hernia types and unusual types of visceral hernias are listed below, in alphabetical order:
*Abdominal wall hernias:
**Umbilical hernia
**Epigastric hernia: a hernia through the linea alba above the umbilicus.
**Spigelian hernia, also known as spontaneous lateral ventral hernia
*Amyand&#x27;s hernia: containing the appendix vermiformis within the hernia sac
*Brain herniation, sometimes referred to as brain hernia, is a potentially deadly side effect of very high intracranial pressure that occurs when a part of the brain is squeezed across structures within the skull.
*Broad ligament hernia, of the uterus.
*Double indirect hernia: an indirect inguinal hernia with two hernia sacs, without a concomitant direct hernia component (as seen in a pantaloon hernia).
*Hiatus hernia: a hernia due to &quot;short oesophagus&quot; — insufficient elongation — stomach is displaced into the thorax
*Littre&#x27;s hernia: a hernia involving a Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum. It is named after the French anatomist Alexis Littré (1658–1726).
*Lumbar hernia: a hernia in the lumbar region (not to be confused with a lumbar disc hernia), contains the following entities:
**Petit&#x27;s hernia: a hernia through Petit&#x27;s triangle (inferior lumbar triangle). It is named after French surgeon Jean Louis Petit (1674–1750).
**Grynfeltt&#x27;s hernia: a hernia through Grynfeltt-Lesshaft triangle (superior lumbar triangle). It is named after physician Joseph Grynfeltt (1840–1913).
*Maydl&#x27;s hernia: two adjacent loops of small intestine are within a hernial sac with a tight neck. The intervening portion of bowel within the abdomen is deprived of its blood supply and eventually becomes necrotic.
*Obturator hernia: hernia through obturator canal

*Parastomal hernias, which is when tissue protrudes adjacent to a stoma tract.
*Paraumbilical hernia: a type of umbilical hernia occurring in adults
*Perineal hernia: a perineal hernia protrudes through the muscles and fascia of the perineal floor. It may be primary but usually is acquired following perineal prostatectomy, abdominoperineal resection of the rectum, or pelvic exenteration.
*Properitoneal hernia: rare hernia located directly above the peritoneum, for example, when part of inguinal hernia projects from the deep inguinal ring to the preperitoneal space.
*Retrocolic hernia: entrapment of portions of the small intestine behind the mesocolon.
*Richter&#x27;s hernia: a hernia involving only one sidewall of the bowel, which can result in bowel strangulation leading to perforation through ischaemia without causing bowel obstruction or any of its warning signs. It is named after German surgeon August Gottlieb Richter (1742–1812).
*Sliding hernia: occurs when an organ drags along part of the peritoneum, or, in other words, the organ is part of the hernia sac. The colon and the urinary bladder are often involved. The term also frequently refers to sliding hernias of the stomach.
*Sciatic hernia: this hernia in the greater sciatic foramen most commonly presents as an uncomfortable mass in the gluteal area. Bowel obstruction may also occur. This type of hernia is only a rare cause of sciatic neuralgia.
*Sports hernia: a hernia characterized by chronic groin pain in athletes and a dilated superficial inguinal ring.
*Tibialis anterior hernia: can present as a bulge in the shins. Pain on rest, walking, or during exercise may occur. The bulge can typically not be present unless pressure or flexing of the leg occurs.
*Velpeau hernia: a hernia in the groin in front of the femoral blood vessels

===Truss===

The benefits of the use of an external device to maintain reduction of the hernia without repairing the underlying defect (such as hernia trusses, trunks, belts, etc.) are unclear.

===Surgery===
Surgery is recommended for some types of hernias to prevent complications such as obstruction of the bowel or strangulation of the tissue, although umbilical hernias and hiatus hernias may be watched, or are treated with medication. Most abdominal hernias can be surgically repaired, but surgery has complications. Prior to surgery patients should be medically optimized receive guidance about changing factors that can be controlled, such as quitting smoking, managing medical conditions like diabetes effectively, and working on losing weight.

Three primary methods can be utilized: open surgery, laparoscopy, or robotic techniques. Fixing an inguinal hernia using laparoscopy causes less pain, speeds up recovery, and shows similar low rates of the hernia coming back compared to the traditional open repair method. However, open surgery can be done sometimes without general anesthesia. Using local anesthesia for open groin hernia repair, particularly in patients with additional health issues, leads to fewer complications and reduced costs. Studies show that compared to regional or general anesthesia, local anesthesia results in less postoperative pain, shorter recovery times, and decreased unplanned overnight stays. However, it might not be enough for repairing large hernias or in patients with abdominal domain loss, where general anesthesia is preferred.

Robot-assisted hernia surgery has also recently gained popularity as safe alternatives to open surgery. Robotic surgery for inguinal hernia repair shows outcomes comparable to laparoscopic surgery. The rates of overall complications, long-lasting postoperative pain, urinary retention, and 30-day re-admission are very similar between these two methods. Just like in other areas of general surgery, it has been noted that robotic surgery for inguinal hernia repair takes more time in the operating room compared to the laparoscopic approach.

Uncomplicated hernias are principally repaired by pushing back, or &quot;reducing&quot;, the herniated tissue, and then mending the weakness in muscle tissue (an operation called herniorrhaphy). If complications have occurred, the surgeon will check the viability of the herniated organ and remove part of it if necessary.

Muscle reinforcement techniques often involve synthetic materials (a mesh prosthesis). The mesh is placed either over the defect (anterior repair) or under the defect (posterior repair). At times staples are used to keep the mesh in place. These mesh repair methods are often called &quot;tension free&quot; repairs because, unlike some suture methods (e.g., Shouldice), muscle is not pulled together under tension. However, this widely used terminology is misleading, as there are many tension-free suture methods that do not use mesh (e.g., Desarda, Guarnieri, Lipton-Estrin, etc.).

Evidence suggests that tension-free methods (with or without mesh) often have lower percentage of recurrences and the fastest recovery period compared to tension suture methods. However, the use of prosthetic mesh appears to have a higher likelihood of causing long-term pain and can also lead to infections.

The frequency of surgical correction ranges from 10 per 100,000 (U.K.) to 28 per 100,000 (U.S.). After elective surgery, the 30-day mortality rate for inguinal or femoral hernia repair stands at 0.1 percent, but it increases to 2.8 to 3.1 percent after urgent surgery. When a bowel resection is part of the hernia repair, the mortality rate is even higher. Older age, femoral hernias, female sex, and urgent repair are identified as other factors linked to a higher risk of mortality.

Post-Operative Complications

Some complications from surgery in order of prevalence include a seroma/hematoma formation, urinary retention, neuralgias, testicular pain/swelling, mesh infection/wound infection, and recurrence. A seroma is often seen after an indirect hernia repair and resolves spontaneously over 4–6 weeks. To prevent a seroma it&#x27;s important to reduce the amount of cutting around the hernia sac where it&#x27;s connected to the cord structures. Additionally, securely attaching the hernia sac to the pubic bone and creating small openings in the tissue around a direct hernia can help. In cases of heavy bleeding or extensive cutting, certain surgeons may opt to insert a drain. Urinary retention is often seen in elderly patients, these patients can be catheterized prior to surgery if there is a risk. Other complications may arise post-operatively, including rejection of the mesh that is used to repair the hernia. In the event of a mesh rejection, the mesh will very likely need to be removed. Mesh rejection can be detected by obvious, sometimes localized swelling and pain around the mesh area. Continuous discharge from the scar is likely for a while after the mesh has been removed. A surgically treated hernia can lead to complications such as inguinodynia.

===Recovery===
Many patients are managed through day surgery centers and are able to return to work within a week or two, though intense activities are prohibited for a longer period. People who have their hernias repaired with mesh often recover within a month, but pain can last longer. Surgical complications may include pain that lasts more than three months, surgical site infections, nerve and blood vessel injuries, injury to nearby organs, and hernia recurrence. Pain that lasts more than three months occurs in about 10% of people following hernia repair.

<text>Sherman&#x27;s March: A Meditation on the Possibility of Romantic Love In the South During an Era of Nuclear Weapons Proliferation is a 1986 cinéma vérité documentary film written and directed by Ross McElwee. It was awarded a Grand Jury prize at the 1987 Sundance Film Festival, and was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry in 2000.

==Background==
McElwee initially planned to make a film about the effects of General William Tecumseh Sherman&#x27;s Civil War campaign through Georgia and the Carolinas, the Georgia portion of which is commonly called his &quot;March to the Sea&quot;. A romantic breakup that the director experienced before filming made it difficult for him to separate personal from professional concerns, however, shifting his focus to create a more personal story about the women in his life, romance, and religion. Other themes include the threat of nuclear war amidst the Cold War and the legacy and complexity of Sherman&#x27;s own life.

The film follows a repetitive narrative pattern: McElwee becomes enamored with various women, eventually developing feelings for each of his subjects, only to have his romantic hopes dashed. McElwee stated it’s a personal essay blending fiction and nonfiction.

==Production==
McElwee called his previous film &quot;Backyard&quot; &quot;a sketch for &quot;Sherman&#x27;s March&quot;, an experiment in how I could approach the bigger film&quot;. He called the former film &quot;cruder&quot; because I was just learning to shoot as a one-person crew. I was just getting over that odd sense of camera shyness in reverse. It takes a while to summon the gumption to shoot people you know well, to be able to face them and talk to them as you&#x27;re filming. Also, I was using a Nagra 4, a very large tape recorder: it weighs 20 pounds and I carried it slung over my shoulder. For &quot;Sherman&#x27;s March,&quot; I used a miniature Nagra SN, a very highly developed piece of recording equipment that could fit on my belt. This technological improvement made shooting much easier.

Initially, McElwee thought the film would be a &quot;synthesis of &quot;Backyard&quot; and &quot;Space Coast&quot;,&quot; but the day after filming the Scottish games, his sister said—somewhat seriously, somewhat joking—&#x27;You should use the camera as a way to meet women.&#x27; She&#x27;s sincerely upset about my having ended my relationship with my girlfriend, and she&#x27;s looking for ways to get me back on my feet. ...[A]t the point when she gave me her advice about how to use the camera, I experienced a minor epiphany.

McElwee set out to film &quot;Sherman&#x27;s March&quot; with just a $9,000 grant (), and began conducting mostly impromptu interviews. &quot;Pretty much I always walked in on them,&quot; he said, characterizing his methods. &quot;I guess what my conversations have that conventional interviews don&#x27;t is a serendipitous quality, and emotional charge that has something to do with the personal connection between the subject and the film-maker. I never came with a list of questions.&quot; The film ultimately cost $75,000 () to complete.

Principal photography lasted about five months, and McElwee estimated that he shot about 25 hours of footage: I was almost always ready to shoot. I kept the camera within reaching distance, sometimes balanced on my shoulder ... Even between major portraits, when I was on the road, I was totally open to filming whatever might happen in a gas station or in a restaurant, or wherever. So in one sense you can count all that time as &#x27;filming time.&#x27;

==Reception ==
In 1985, Jay Carr of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; called McElwee a &quot;Tarheel Woody Allen&quot; and the film &quot;like a series of variations on loneliness, funny and sad&quot; but &quot;never self-pitying,&quot; &quot;sustain[ing] its loopy absurdist tone, reveling in the post-Civil War ironies of the misunderstood Sherman, identifying with them.&quot;

In a &quot;New York Times&quot; &quot;Critics&#x27; Pick&quot; review of the documentary, Vincent Canby called McElwee a &quot;film maker-anthropologist with a rare appreciation for the eccentric details of our edgy civilization,&quot; and the film both &quot;a timely memoir of the 80&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;a very cheerful recollection of the kind of self-searching, home-movie documentaries that Jim McBride, the director, and L. M. Kit Carson, the writer and actor, satirized so brilliantly in their fiction film, &quot;David Holzman&#x27;s Diary&quot;.

In 1994, McElwee told &quot;MovieMaker Magazine&#x27;s&quot; Paula Hunt:
The distributor of First Run Features saw &quot;Sherman&#x27;s March&quot; at the IFP (the &quot;Independent Feature Project&quot;) in New York and immediately said he&#x27;d take it. I wanted to shop around a bit, because it&#x27;s a very small company and I wanted to see what else was available. I got turned down by every other middle-range distributor. I didn&#x27;t even bother to go to the studios or the major distribution outlets. First Run Features was the only company willing to take a chance on it and, in fact, it did terrifically well. According to their statistics, until &quot;Strangers in Good Company&quot; came along it was their top-grossing film. It&#x27;s supposed to be the tenth-highest grossing feature documentary of all time. Isn&#x27;t that incredible? I could never have imagined it being that kind of a film.

Scott MacDonald wrote in his introduction to a summer 1988 &quot;Film Quarterly&quot; interview with McElwee:
We get to know McElwee&#x27;s (or McElwee&#x27;s filmic persona&#x27;s) hopes, concerns, nightmares; and we are behind the camera with McElwee as he uses the film-making process to forge new relationships and to revise previously important relationships. As is true in many literary first-person narratives, McElwee&#x27;s approach in &quot;Sherman&#x27;s March&quot; is simultaneously very revealing and somewhat mysterious: the candidness of the scenes is frequently startling, but the more the film — and McElwee-as-narrator — reveals, the more we realize that there are many aspects of the relationships he is recording that we are not privy to. We cannot help but wonder about the narrator as we experience things with him.

Paul Attanasio wrote that the &quot;richness of &quot;Sherman&#x27;s March&quot; comes from the way McElwee, in his roundabout way, completes the portrait of Sherman he originally set out to achieve&quot;, but considered it too long, especially given its poor technical quality.

=== Accolades ===
&quot;Sherman&#x27;s March&quot; was awarded the Grand Jury prize in the documentary category at the 1987 Sundance Film Festival. In 2000, the Library of Congress deemed the film &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry, calling it a &quot;hilarious, one-of-a-kind romantic exploration of the South.&quot;

== Legacy ==
A 1998 review in &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; proclaims McElwee &quot;a modern master of cinéma vérité — rough, real-life documentary filmmaking that seeks to expose a subject&#x27;s soul through its very lack of polish. In McElwee&#x27;s case, that subject is almost always himself. Insistently personal, always autobiographical, occasionally exploitative, watching McElwee is like watching someone&#x27;s (well-financed) home videos.&quot;

In April 2004, &quot;Slant&quot; magazine, reviewing the film&#x27;s then-newly released DVD, gave it three stars out of five, saying that it &quot;looks and sounds like its from 1986, but no amount of dirt and noise (and there&#x27;s some here and there) can diffuse any of the film&#x27;s magic.&quot;

&quot;Sherman&#x27;s March&quot; influenced the 2022 film &quot;Everything Everywhere All At Once&quot; by Daniels, particularly its exploration of the concept of modal realism.

<text>Shock Corridor is a 1963 American psychological thriller film starring Peter Breck, Constance Towers, and Gene Evans. Written, directed and produced by Samuel Fuller, it tells the story of a journalist who gets himself intentionally committed to a mental hospital to solve a murder committed within the institution.

In 1996, &quot;Shock Corridor&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
Bent on winning a Pulitzer Prize, ambitious journalist Johnny Barrett hopes to uncover the facts behind the unsolved murder of Sloan, an inmate at a psychiatric hospital. He convinces an expert psychiatrist, Dr. Fong, to coach him to appear insane when it involves relating imaginary accounts of incest with his &quot;sister&quot;, who is impersonated by his exotic-dancer girlfriend, Cathy; though against her wishes, she is talked into assisting him by filing a police complaint, and his performance during the investigation convinces the authorities to incarcerate him in the institution where the murder took place. Johnny is quickly disturbed by the behavior of his fellow inmates, and on one occasion is mauled by a group of female nymphomaniacs who assault him in their ward.

Johnny learns the murder had three witnesses, each driven insane by the stresses of war, bigotry, or fear of nuclear annihilation (each witness represents one of the obsession of Americans at that time; war, atomic war and racism). The first witness, Stuart, is the son of a Southern sharecropper who was taught bigotry and hatred as a child. He was captured in the Korean War and was brainwashed into becoming a Communist. Stuart was ordered to indoctrinate a fellow prisoner, but instead the prisoner&#x27;s unwavering patriotism reformed him. Stuart&#x27;s captors pronounced him insane and he was returned to the United States in a prisoner exchange, after which he received a dishonorable discharge and was publicly reviled as a traitor. Stuart now imagines himself to be Confederate States of America General J.E.B. Stuart. Through conversation with Stuart, Johnny discerns that the killer was likely a hospital staff member, as Stuart recalled the assailant was dressed in white.

The second witness to Sloan&#x27;s murder, Trent, was one of the first black students to integrate a segregated Southern university. Psychologically traumatized by the abuses he suffered there, he now imagines himself a member of the Ku Klux Klan, and stirs up the patients with white nationalist dogma. The third and final witness is Boden, an atomic scientist scarred by the knowledge of the devastating power of intercontinental ballistic missiles. He has regressed to the mentality of a six-year-old child.

After a hospital riot, Barrett is straitjacketed and subjected to shock treatment, and comes to believe Cathy is truly his sister, rejecting her when she visits. He experiences many other symptoms of mental breakdown while he learns the identity of the killer - Wilkes, a hospital attendant who committed the murder to cover up his sexual liaisons with numerous female patients. Johnny confronts Wilkes in the hydrotherapy room, and begins a violent altercation with him, eventually extracting a confession in front of witnesses.

Wilkes is apprehended, and Johnny is finally able to write his story on Sloan&#x27;s murder, but the ordeal leaves him with a shattered psyche, and he is diagnosed with schizophrenia. Some time later, Cathy visits Johnny in the hospital. She laments to a psychologist about Johnny&#x27;s mental decline, as Johnny sits idly in a catatonic state.

==Cast==
==Production==
Fuller originally wrote the film under the title &quot;Straitjacket&quot; for Fritz Lang in the late 1940s, but Lang wanted to change the lead character to a woman, so Joan Bennett could play the role.

The film was shot on a ten-day shooting schedule with scarce resources.

Constance Towers was asked by Fuller to be in the film during dinner at Fuller&#x27;s house.

==Release==
It has been released by the Criterion Collection on different formats, starting with LaserDisc.

===Reception===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 94% based on , with a weighted average rating of 7.86/10. 
Author and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film three out of a possible four stars, calling it a &quot;[p]owerful melodrama with raw, emotional impact.&quot; Andrew Sarris praised the film as “…an allegory of America today, not so much surreal as subreal in its hallucinatory view of history which can only be perceived beneath a littered surface of plot intrigue… a distinguished addition to that art form in which Hollywood has always excelled: the Baroque B-picture.” 

In 1996, &quot;Shock Corridor&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

Martin Scorsese&#x27;s 2010 film &quot;Shutter Island&quot; is said to be influenced by this film.

==Novelization==

Concurrent with the release of the film in 1963, Belmont Books released a novelization of the screenplay, written by one of the era&#x27;s most popular and distinctive paperback pulpsmiths, Michael Avallone. Fuller wanted to stop Avallone&#x27;s book for plagiarism, but both writers were credited when it was released.

<text>Shane is a 1953 American Western film directed and produced by George Stevens and starring Alan Ladd, Jean Arthur, Van Heflin, Brandon deWilde and Jack Palance. The screenplay, written by A. B. Guthrie Jr. (with contributions from Jack Sher), is based on the 1949 novel of the same name by Jack Schaefer. Set in the Wyoming Territory in 1889, the film follows the titular character, a gunfighter with a mysterious past who becomes embroiled in a conflict between poor homesteaders and wealthy ranchers. The novel and film were both inspired by the Johnson County War (1888–1893).

The film was released by Paramount Pictures on April 23, 1953. It was both a critical and commercial success, and was noted at the time for its Technicolor landscape cinematography, editing, performances, and contributions to the genre. It was also the last feature film and the only color film of Arthur&#x27;s career.

&quot;Shane&quot; was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Director, winning for Best Cinematography – Color (Loyal Griggs). It was listed as number 45 in the 2007 edition of AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies list, and number three on AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10 in the Western category. In 1993, the film was selected for preservation in the United States&#x27; National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
Shane, a laconic but skilled gunfighter with a mysterious past, rides into an isolated valley in the sparsely settled Wyoming Territory in 1889. A drifter, he is hired as a farmhand by hardscrabble rancher Joe Starrett, who is homesteading with his wife, Marian, and their young son, Joey. Starrett tells Shane that a war of intimidation is being waged on the valley&#x27;s settlers. Though they have claimed their land legally under the Homestead Acts, a ruthless cattle baron, Rufus Ryker, has hired various rogues and henchmen to harass them and force them out of the valley. 
Shane goes to town alone to buy supplies at Grafton&#x27;s, a general store with an adjacent saloon. Shane enters the saloon, where Ryker&#x27;s men are drinking, and orders a soda pop for Joey. Chris Calloway, one of Ryker&#x27;s men, ridicules and taunts Shane by throwing his drink on him, but Shane ignores him and leaves. On Shane&#x27;s next trip to town with the Starretts and other homesteaders, he fights and defeats Calloway, and then he and Starrett win a bar room brawl against most of Ryker&#x27;s other men. Ryker promises the next fight will be with guns. Ryker hires Jack Wilson, an unscrupulous and notoriously skilled gunfighter. Joey admires Shane, much to his mother&#x27;s chagrin, after Shane demonstrates his shooting skills.

Frank &quot;Stonewall&quot; Torrey, a hot-tempered ex-Confederate homesteader, is taunted and forced to draw his gun by Wilson, who then shoots Torrey dead outside the saloon. At Torrey&#x27;s funeral, the settlers discuss abandoning their struggle and leaving the valley, but after witnessing one of their homesteads being destroyed in a fire set by Ryker&#x27;s men, they find new resolve to continue the fight. Ryker concludes Starrett is primarily responsible for their resolve.

With the purpose of killing him, Ryker invites Starrett to a meeting at the saloon, ostensibly to negotiate a settlement. Calloway, no longer loyal to Ryker, warns Shane of the double cross. Resolved to protect Starrett from an ambush, Shane intervenes, even knocking Starrett unconscious to save him. Shane rides to town with Joey following on foot to watch the fight. Shane kills Wilson, Ryker, and Ryker&#x27;s brother, but is injured. Outside, Shane sees Joey, who notices that Shane is bleeding. Shane bids farewell and rides out of the valley, ignoring Joey&#x27;s desperate cries of &quot;Shane! Come back!&quot;

==Cast==
==Production==

&quot;Shane&quot; was expensive for a Western movie at the time with a cost of $3.1 million. It was the first film to be projected in a &quot;flat&quot; widescreen 1.66:1 ratio, a format that Paramount invented to offer audiences a wider panorama than television could provide.

Although never explicitly stated, the basic plot elements of &quot;Shane&quot; were derived from the 1892 Johnson County War in Wyoming, the archetypal cattlemen/homesteaders conflict, which also served as the background for &quot;The Virginian&quot; and &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;. The physical setting is the high plains near Jackson, Wyoming, and many shots feature the Grand Teton massif looming in the near distance. The fictional town and Starrett homestead were constructed for the film near Kelly, in the Jackson Hole valley, and demolished after filming was completed. One vintage structure that appeared briefly in the film, the Ernie Wright Cabin (now popularly referred to by locals as the &quot;Shane Cabin&quot;) still stands, but is steadily deteriorating due to its classification as &quot;ruins&quot; by the National Park Service.

Alan Ladd disliked and was uncomfortable with guns; Shane&#x27;s shooting demonstration for Joey required 116 takes. A careful review of Shane&#x27;s gun-skill demonstration to Joey shows Alan Ladd firing with his eyes closed. Later, in the saloon battle, Ladd&#x27;s pistol is pointed well away from the man he shoots, especially the final scene- where he kills Ryker&#x27;s brother. Jack Palance was nervous around horses, and had great difficulty with mounting and dismounting. After very many attempts, he finally executed a flawless dismount, which Stevens then used for all of the Wilson character&#x27;s dismounts and—run in reverse—his mounts as well. Palance looked so awkward on horseback that Stevens was forced to replace Wilson&#x27;s introductory ride into town astride his galloping horse with Palance riding at walking pace. Stevens later noted that the change actually made Wilson&#x27;s entrance more dramatic and menacing.

The final scene, in which the wounded Shane explains to a distraught Joey why he has to leave (&quot;There&#x27;s no living with a killing&quot;), was a moving moment for the entire cast and crew, except Brandon deWilde. &quot;Every time Ladd spoke his lines of farewell, deWilde crossed his eyes and stuck out his tongue, making Ladd laugh. Finally, Ladd called to the boy&#x27;s father, &#x27;Make the kid stop or I&#x27;ll beat him over the head.&#x27; DeWilde behaved.&quot;

=== Casting ===

Director George Stevens originally wanted Montgomery Clift and William Holden for the Shane and Starrett roles; when both proved unavailable, Stevens asked Paramount executive Y. Frank Freeman for a list of available actors with current contracts; within three minutes, he chose Alan Ladd, Van Heflin, and Jean Arthur. &quot;Shane&quot; was Arthur&#x27;s first cinematic role in five years, and her last, at the age of 50, though she later appeared in theater, and a short-lived television series. She accepted the part at the request of Stevens, who had directed her in &quot;The Talk of the Town&quot; (1942) with Cary Grant and Ronald Colman, and &quot;The More the Merrier&quot; (1943) for which she received her only Oscar nomination.

When asked if he enjoyed the movie, the author of &quot;Shane&quot;, Jack Schaefer, replied, “Yeah, I did, all except for that runt&quot;, referring to the Ladd. In 1989, Schaefer told the Oberlin alumni magazine that his &quot;Shane&quot; character was supposed to be a “dark, deadly person&quot; whom he had hoped would be played by George Raft.

===Technical details===
Although the film was shot using the standard 1.37:1 Academy ratio, Paramount picked &quot;Shane&quot; to debut its wide-screen system because it was composed largely of long and medium shots that would not be compromised by cropping the image. Using a newly cut aperture plate in the movie projector, and a wider-angle lens, the film was exhibited in first-run venues at an aspect ratio of 1.66:1. For its premiere, the studio replaced the 34-by-25-foot screen in Radio City Music Hall with one measuring 50 feet wide by 30 feet high. Paramount produced all of its subsequent films at that ratio until 1954, when it switched to 1.85:1. &quot;Shane&quot; was originally released in April 1953 with a conventional optical soundtrack, but as its popularity grew, a new three-track, stereophonic soundtrack was recorded and played on an interlocking 35 mm magnetic reel in the projection booth.

Stevens wanted to demonstrate to audiences &quot;the horrors of violence&quot;. To emphasize the terrible power of gunshots, he created a cannon-like sound effect by firing a large-caliber weapon into a garbage can. In addition, he had the two principal shooting victims—Palance and Elisha Cook Jr.—rigged with hidden wires that jerked them violently backward when shot. These innovations, according to film historian Jay Hyams, marked the beginning of graphic violence in Western movies. He quotes Sam Peckinpah: &quot;When Jack Palance shot Elisha Cook Jr. in &quot;Shane&quot;, things started to change.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Shane&quot; premiered in New York City at Radio City Music Hall on April 23, 1953, and grossed $114,000 in its four weeks there. In all, the film earned about $9 million in theater rentals from the United States and Canada. By one estimate, that translates into about $20 million in actual box-office receipts.

Bosley Crowther called the film a &quot;rich and dramatic mobile painting of the American frontier&quot;. He continued:

Crowther called &quot;the concept and the presence&quot; of Joey, the little boy played by Brandon deWilde, &quot;key to permit[ting] a refreshing viewpoint on material that&#x27;s not exactly new. For it&#x27;s this youngster&#x27;s frank enthusiasms and naive reactions that are made the solvent of all the crashing drama in A. B. Guthrie Jr.&#x27;s script.&quot;

Woody Allen has called &quot;Shane&quot; &quot;George Stevens&#x27; masterpiece&quot;, on his 2001 list of great American films, along with &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot;, &quot;White Heat&quot;, &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;, &quot;The Informer&quot;, and &quot;The Hill&quot;. &quot;Shane&quot;, he wrote, &quot;is a great movie and can hold its own with any film, whether it&#x27;s a Western or not.&quot;

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Shane&quot; has a 97% critical approval rating, based on 33 reviews.

==Influence on later works==
The 1966 TV series &quot;Shane&quot; starring David Carradine was directly based on the film.

The 1980 Japanese film features a similar plot.

In 1981, British singer Kim Wilde released the song &quot;Shane&quot; as the B-side to her single &quot;Chequered Love&quot;. The lyrics, written by Wilde&#x27;s brother Ricky and her father Marty, deal with the impressions of the movie

The 1982 Italian comic book &quot;Ken Parker 53 - I Pionieri&quot;, published by Sergio Bonelli Editore draws inspiration from this movie. It reimagines the story of the Shane, with Ken Parker as a lone hero protecting a broken settler family in the American West.

The 1984 song by Roger Waters, &quot;The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking&quot;, includes the lyric &quot;Do you remember Shane?&quot; and the recording features interspersed audio from the film.

The 1985 song by Haustor, &quot;Šejn&quot; from their album &quot;Bolero&quot; is named after the film.
The 1987 postapocalyptic movie, &quot;Steel Dawn,&quot; closely follows the plot of &quot;Shane&quot;, according to Walter Goodman of &quot;The New York Times.&quot;

In his 1997 album &quot;Arizona Bay&quot;, Bill Hicks parodies Jack Palance&#x27;s role in Shane with track 8, &quot;Bullies of the World&quot;, likening an unspecified &quot;we&quot;, the arms-producing countries, to Jack Wilson taunting the farmer to &quot;pick up the gun&quot;.

In the 1998 action thriller film &quot;The Negotiator&quot;, the two leading characters have a discussion about Western genre films, &quot;Shane&quot; in particular. Arguing about the ending, Chris Sabian says Shane died, and Danny Roman says &quot;he&#x27;s slumped &#x27;cause he&#x27;s shot. Slumped don&#x27;t mean dead.&quot;

In the 2013 Hallmark series &quot;Signed, Sealed, Delivered,&quot; &quot;Shane, come back&quot;, was referenced.

The 2017 superhero film &quot;Logan&quot; features characters watching scenes from the film, with lines from the film directly quoted.

==Copyright status in Japan==
In 2006, &quot;Shane&quot; was the subject of litigation in Japan involving its copyright status in that country. Two Japanese companies began selling budget-priced copies of &quot;Shane&quot; in 2003, based on a Japanese copyright law that at the time protected cinematographic works for 50 years from the year of their release. After the Japanese legislature amended the law in 2004 to extend the duration of motion picture copyrights from 50 to 70 years, Paramount and its Japanese distributor filed suit against the two companies. A Japanese court ruled that the amendment was not retroactive, so any film released during or prior to 1953 remained in the public domain in Japan.

<text>The Shop Around the Corner is a 1940 American romantic comedy-drama film produced and directed by Ernst Lubitsch and starring Margaret Sullavan, James Stewart, Frank Morgan, and Joseph Schildkraut. The screenplay by Samson Raphaelson is based on the 1937 Hungarian play &quot;Parfumerie&quot; by Miklós László. Eschewing regional politics in the years leading up to World War II, the film is about two employees at a leather goods shop in Budapest who can barely stand each other, not realizing they are falling in love as anonymous correspondents through their letters.

&quot;The Shop Around the Corner&quot; is ranked number 28 on AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Passions, and is listed in &quot;Time&quot;″s All-Time 100 Movies. In 1999, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot ==
Alfred Kralik is the top salesman at Matuschek and Company, a leathergoods shop in Budapest owned by the high-strung Mr. Hugo Matuschek. Kralik&#x27;s co-workers include his friend, Pirovitch, a kindly family man; Ferencz Vadas, a two-faced womanizer; saleswoman Ilona Novotny; clerk Flora Kaczek; and Pepi Katona, an ambitious, precocious delivery boy. One morning, Kralik reveals to Pirovitch that he has been corresponding anonymously with an intelligent and cultured woman whose ad he came across in the newspaper.

Kralik is Mr. Matuschek&#x27;s oldest and most trusted employee, but lately there has been tension between the two. They get into an argument over Mr. Matuschek&#x27;s idea to sell a cigarette box that plays &quot;Ochi Chërnye&quot; when opened. After their exchange, Klara Novak enters the gift shop looking for a job. Kralik tells her there are no openings, but when she is able to sell one of the cigarette boxes (as a candy box), Mr. Matuschek hires her. However, she and Kralik do not get along.

Mr. Matuschek begins to suspect his wife is having an affair, as she stays out late and requests money from him.

As Christmas approaches, Kralik is preparing to meet his mystery correspondent for a dinner date. The meeting is stalled when Mr. Matuschek demands that everyone stay after work to decorate the shop. Kralik is called into Mr. Matuschek&#x27;s office and is fired. No one in the shop understands Mr. Matuschek&#x27;s actions are related to his suspicions that Kralik is having an affair with his wife. Later, Mr. Matuschek meets with a private investigator who informs him that his wife is having an affair with one of his employees—Ferencz Vadas. Pepi returns to the shop just in time to prevent Mr. Matuschek from committing suicide.

Meanwhile, Kralik arrives at the Cafe Nizza, where he discovers that his mystery woman is Novak. Despite his disappointment, Kralik goes in and talks with her, pretending he is there to meet Pirovitch. In his mind, Kralik tries to reconcile the cultured woman of his letters with his annoying co-worker—secretly hoping that things might work out with her. Concerned that Kralik&#x27;s presence will spoil her first meeting with her &quot;far superior&quot; mystery correspondent, she calls Kralik a &quot;little insignificant clerk&quot; and asks him to leave.

Later that night, Kralik goes to the hospital to visit Mr. Matuschek, who apologizes for suspecting him of having an affair with his wife, before offering him a job as manager of Matuschek and Company. Grateful to Pepi for saving his life, Mr. Matuschek promotes him to clerk. The next day, Novak calls in sick after her mystery man failed to show, and at Mr. Matuschek&#x27;s behest, Kralik fires Vadas. That night, when Kralik visits Novak at her apartment, she receives a letter from her correspondent and reads it in front of Kralik (who wrote the letter).

Two weeks later, on Christmas Eve, Matuschek and Company achieves record sales. Kralik and Novak, alone in the shop, discuss their planned dates for the evening and Novak reveals that she had a crush on Kralik when they first met. After pretending to have met Novak&#x27;s mystery man, Kralik places a red carnation in his lapel and reveals to her that he is her mystery correspondent and they kiss.

==Cast==

==Production==
The rights to Miklós László&#x27;s play was purchased by Ernst Lubitsch in 1938 for $7,500 (), and shopped around to different studios over the following year. Dolly Haas and Janet Gaynor were each at one point attached to the film before Margaret Sullavan was cast in the lead role alongside James Stewart; both were not available at the time that production was originally set to begin, so Lubitsch decided to postpone the start date. The film was shot in chronological order.

==Reception==
 
Dave Kehr argued Lubitsch makes &quot;brilliant deployment of point of view, allowing the audience to enter the perceptions of each character at exactly the right moment to develop maximum sympathy and suspense.&quot; It ranked 202nd in the British Film Institute&#x27;s 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; critics&#x27; poll of the greatest films ever made, having garnered eight critics&#x27; votes. The work was also 58th in BBC&#x27;s 2015 poll of the best American films.

Film historian David Thomson wrote:
==Adaptations==
&quot;The Shop Around the Corner&quot; was dramatized in two half-hour broadcasts of &quot;The Screen Guild Theater&quot;, first on September 29, 1940, with Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart, second on February 26, 1945, with Van Johnson and Phyllis Thaxter. It was also dramatized as a one-hour program on &quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot;″s June 23, 1941 broadcast with Claudette Colbert and Don Ameche.

==Remakes==
The film has spawned numerous remakes, among which number:

* A musical, &quot;In the Good Old Summertime&quot; (1949), starring Judy Garland and Van Johnson.
* The 1963 Broadway musical &quot;She Loves Me&quot;.
* Nora Ephron&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Mail&quot; (1998) revolves around two people (Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan) who cultivate an intense personal dislike for one another while carrying on an anonymous romance via email. The film lifts the original&#x27;s premise as well as some scenes that share similar jokes and lines of dialogue. Meg Ryan&#x27;s character owns a bookstore called &quot;The Shop Around the Corner&quot;. Story credit was given to Miklós László for &quot;Parfumerie,&quot; the Hungarian play from which the 1940 film was adapted. 
* The 1996 Indian Tamil-language romance film &quot;Kadhal Kottai&quot; directed by Agathiyan.
* Hallmark&#x27;s &quot;Hanukkah on Rye&quot; (2022), starring Yael Grobglas and Jeremy Jordan.

<text>Sky High is a 1922 American silent Western film written and directed by Lynn Reynolds and starring Tom Mix, J. Farrell MacDonald, Eva Novak and Sid Jordan. The action in &quot;Sky High&quot; takes place in 1922 and while the characters ride horses and fight in saloons, they also use telephones, automobiles and even an aircraft.

In 1998, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
Grant Newbury (Tom Mix), Deputy Inspector of Immigration at the US/Mexico border is asked by his boss to infiltrate a gang smuggling Chinese workers through the border at Calexico, in order to identify and arrest their ringleader. Meanwhile, in Chicago, Estelle Halloway (Eva Novak) is disappointed because her guardian wrote that she would not be able to spend her holidays with him in Calexico as planned. When she wires him that she will come nevertheless with her roommate Marguerite (Adele Warner) and her brother (William Buckley), he tells her that they will meet instead near the Grand Canyon as it is too warm in Calexico.

In Calexico, Grant finds out that the ringleader is none other than Jim Frazer (J. Farrell MacDonald), Estelle&#x27;s guardian. He becomes part of the gang and is requested to go and help taking of the Chinese now hidden in a camp in Grand Canyon. After having left discreetly the camp to fetch the police, he sees Estelle on the point of drowning in a river and saves her. He is caught by the bandit who have learned that he is a government agent but manages to escape first on horseback then in a motor car and reaches the little town of Williams where he gets the help of the police.

While the police drives to the hidden camp in motor cars, Grant borrows an aircraft and flies into the Grand Canyon where he jumps in a river and manages to free Estelle. Jim Frazer is identified as the ringleader and arrested, but to protect Estelle, Grant accepts that he lets her believe that he is leaving for a long trip. Frazer asks Grant whether he would help take care of Estelle while he is in jail and Grant answers: &quot;I&#x27;ll look after her the rest of her life if she&#x27;ll let me.&quot;

==Cast==

* Tom Mix as Grant Newbury
* J. Farrell MacDonald as Jim Frazer
* Eva Novak as Estelle Halloway - his ward
* Sid Jordan as Andrew Bates
* William Buckley as Victor Castle
* Adele Warner as Marguerite Castle
* Tony the Horse
* Wynn Mace as Henchman Patterson

==Production==
Principal photography for &quot;Sky High&quot; took place at the Fox Films studio in Los Angeles and on location at the Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona, Williams, Arizona, and the El Tovar Hotel, Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona. While Tom Mix rarely used doubles, Bud Creeth was hired as a &quot;stunt pilot&quot;, flying with Dick Grace to film the dangerous stunt of hanging from a rope over the Grand Canyon.

==Reception==
In a modern reappraisal of &quot;Sky High&quot;, reviewer Hans J. Wollstein described the film, &quot;Diehard Western fans decried the lack of realism but audiences flocked to see this film which, more than perhaps any other, changed Mix from a popular Western star into an internationally recognized showman.&quot;

Dave Fleischer was credited as director, although virtually all the animation was done by Roland Crandall, who received the opportunity to make &quot;Snow-White&quot; on his own as a reward for his several years of devotion to the Fleischer studio. The resulting film, which took six months to complete, is considered both Crandall&#x27;s masterwork and an important milestone of the Golden age of American animation.

==Synopsis==
A magic mirror resembling Cab Calloway proclaims Betty Boop to be &quot;the fairest in the land&quot;, much to the anger of the Queen. The Queen orders her guards Bimbo and Koko to execute Betty. With tears in their eyes, they take Betty into the forest; as they prepare to execute her, they spare her by destroying their weapons, but fall into a pit before they can free her. Betty escapes into a frozen river, which encloses her in a coffin of ice. This block slips downhill to the home of the seven dwarfs, who carry the frozen Betty into an enchanted cave, running into Koko and Bimbo. The evil Queen, now transformed into a witch, turns Koko into a ghost as he sings the St. James Infirmary Blues. With her rivals disposed of, the Queen again asks the magic mirror who the fairest in the land is, but the mirror explodes in a puff of magic smoke that returns Betty and Koko to their normal states and changes the Queen into a hideous and mysterious dragon-like monster. The dragon-like monster chases the protagonists until Bimbo grabs its tongue and yanks it, turning the creature inside out and causing it to flee away. Betty, Koko, and Bimbo dance around in a circle of victory as the film ends.

==Legacy==
Koko&#x27;s dancing (including some moves that look like the much later &quot;moonwalk&quot; and &quot;dab&quot;) during the &quot;St. James&quot; number is rotoscoped from footage of Cab Calloway.

The film was deemed &quot;culturally significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry in 1994. The same year, it was voted #19 of the 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation field. The film is copyrighted by Paramount due to its copyright being renewed in 1961.

<text>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a 1937 American animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by RKO Radio Pictures. Based on the 1812 German fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm, the production was supervised by David Hand, and was directed by a team of sequence directors, including Perce Pearce, William Cottrell, Larry Morey, Wilfred Jackson, and Ben Sharpsteen. It is the first animated feature film produced in the United States and the first cel animated feature film.

&quot;Snow White&quot; premiered at the Carthay Circle Theatre in Los Angeles, California, on December 21, 1937, and went into general release in the United States on February 4, 1938. Despite initial doubts from the film industry, it was a critical and commercial success, with international earnings of more than $8 million during its initial release against a $1.5 million budget, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1938, and briefly holding the record of the highest-grossing sound film of all time. It was also the highest-grossing animated film for 55 years. The popularity of the film has led to its being re-released theatrically many times, until its home video release in the 1990s. Adjusted for inflation, it is one of the top-ten performers at the North American box office and is still the highest-grossing animated film with an adjusted gross of $. Worldwide, its inflation-adjusted earnings top the animation list.

&quot;Snow White&quot; was nominated for Best Musical Score at the Academy Awards in 1938, and the next year, producer Walt Disney was awarded an honorary Oscar for the film. This award was unique, consisting of one normal-sized, plus seven miniature Oscar statuettes. They were presented to Disney by Shirley Temple.

Its prototypical animated feature and use of fairy tale adaptations as well as technical innovation became a major milestone of the early animation industry, &quot;Snow White&quot; is widely regarded as one of the greatest films ever made and creating the new form of the golden age of animation; Disney&#x27;s take on the fairy tale has had a significant cultural effect, resulting in popular theme park attractions, a video game, a Broadway musical, and an upcoming live-action film.

In 1989, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; and selected it as one of the first 25 films for preservation in the National Film Registry. The American Film Institute ranked it among the 100 greatest American films, and also named the film as the greatest American animated film of all time in 2008.

==Plot==

Having lost both of her parents at a young age, Snow White is a princess living with her wicked and cold-hearted stepmother, the Queen. Fearing that Snow White&#x27;s beauty will outshine her own, the Queen forces her to work as a scullery maid and asks her Magic Mirror daily &quot;who is the fairest one of all.&quot; For years, the mirror always answers that the Queen is, pleasing her.

One day, Snow White meets and falls in love with a prince who overhears her singing. On that same day, the Magic Mirror informs the Queen that Snow White is now the fairest in all of the land. Angered, the Queen orders her Huntsman to take Snow White into the forest, kill her, and bring back her heart in a jeweled box as proof. The Huntsman cannot bring himself to kill Snow White and reveals to her the Queen&#x27;s plot. He then urges her to flee into the woods and never return.

Lost and frightened, Snow White is befriended by woodland animals who lead her to a cottage deep in the woods. Finding seven small chairs in the cottage&#x27;s dining room, Snow White assumes the cottage is the untidy home of seven orphaned children. With the animals&#x27; help, she proceeds to clean the place and cook a meal. Snow White soon learns that the cottage is the home of seven dwarfs named Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey, who work in a nearby mine. Returning home, they are alarmed to find their cottage clean, and suspect that an intruder has invaded their home. Snow White introduces herself, and the dwarfs welcome her after she offers to clean and cook for them. Snow White keeps house for the dwarfs while they mine for jewels during the day; and at night, they all sing, play music, and dance.

Back at the castle, the Magic Mirror reveals that Snow White is still living, and with the dwarfs. Enraged that the Huntsman tricked her, the Queen creates a poisoned apple that will put whoever eats it into a death-like sleep. She learns the curse can be broken by &quot;love&#x27;s first kiss,&quot; but is certain Snow White will be buried alive before this can happen. Using a potion to disguise herself as an old hag, the Queen goes to the cottage while the dwarfs are away. The animals see through the disguise, but are unable to warn Snow White; they rush off to find the dwarfs. The Queen fools Snow White into biting into the apple, and she falls into a death-like slumber.

The dwarfs return with the animals as the Queen leaves the cottage, and give chase, trapping her on a cliff. She tries to roll a boulder onto them, but lightning strikes the cliff before she can do so, causing her to fall and get crushed to death by the boulder. In their cottage, the dwarfs find Snow White asleep by the poison. Unwilling to bury her in the ground, they instead place her in a glass coffin in the forest. Together with the animals, they keep watch over her.

The following spring, the prince learns of Snow White&#x27;s eternal sleep and visits the coffin. Saddened by her apparent death, he kisses her, which breaks the spell and awakens her. The dwarfs and animals all rejoice as the prince takes Snow White to his castle.

==Production==
===Development===
Walt Disney conceived the idea of making his first feature-length film in 1933, when his animation studio was focusing on production of animated short films, such as the &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; series. Although they were popular with the audience, Disney believed that the shorts did not bring enough profit for the further growth of the studio; he also saw the full-length film as a way to expand his &quot;storytelling possibilities&quot;, allowing for elaborate plots and character development. By late March 1933, he was approached by Mary Pickford (co-founder of United Artists that was distributing Disney&#x27;s works at the time) with a proposal for a feature-length animated/live-action version of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s novel &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; (1865); however, the project was soon scrapped when Paramount Pictures began production of their own film version. Disney then considered using the same concept for a film adaptation of Washington Irving&#x27;s short story &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; (1819) starring Will Rogers, but it did not work out either due to Paramount, which held the rights to the story, refusing to give permission.

After the successful release of the &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; short &quot;Three Little Pigs&quot; in May 1933, Disney was strengthened in his decision to make a feature film and began introducing the idea to his staff through a &quot;slow infiltration&quot;sharing it with everyone individually during casual conversations. He entered into negotiations with Merian C. Cooper to produce a full-length animated version of Victor Herbert&#x27;s 1903 operetta &quot;Babes in Toyland&quot; in Technicolor; the project was offered to RKO Radio Pictures, which owned the rights to the play, but RKO executives rejected it. In July 1933, Disney first revealed his plans on making a feature film to &quot;The Film Daily&quot; (although he had not yet managed to find a response from the United Artists executives), and around the same time, he was approached with an offer for an animated version of Felix Salten&#x27;s 1923 novel &quot;Bambi, a Life in the Woods&quot; in alliance with Sidney Franklin. Disney eventually rejected the idea, feeling that his studio was not ready for the technical challenges that &quot;Bambi&quot; would have presented. Homer&#x27;s poems &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;, as well as Jonathan Swift&#x27;s 1726 book &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, were also suggested to Disney at the time.

Disney settled on the Brothers Grimm&#x27;s 1812 fairy tale &quot;Snow White&quot; in the spring of 1934. He had been familiar with the story since he was a teenager, having seen the 1916 silent film version, which he later cited as the primary reason for choosing &quot;Snow White&quot; for his first feature production. Disney had originally planned to produce &quot;Snow White&quot; as a &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; short, but reconsidered, believing that the story had enough potential for a feature film adaptation. He formally announced his plans on &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; to &quot;The New York Times&quot; in June 1934, estimating that the film could be produced for a budget of $250,000, which was roughly ten times the budget of an average &quot;Silly Symphony&quot;. The project (then known as the &quot;Feature Symphony&quot;) was initially developed by a small unit of writers that Disney personally supervised, before it was introduced to the studio staff at large on October 30, 1934, when the basic story outline was completed. As some animators later recalled, Disney assembled them on the sound stage in the evening and acted out the entire story of &quot;Snow White&quot; for three hours, concluding with announcement of their first feature film.

Although the studio staff were excited about the project, they were unsure that the full-length cartoon would sustain an audience&#x27;s attention. Ward Kimball said that they were told by Hollywood moguls (such as W. C. Fields) that &quot;it was OK, six-seven minutes, like the shorts, but an hour and a half, no way! Big reason was that you run out of funny things to do, you had to have a laugh-a-minute. And the bright colors would hurt your eyes, everybody would get up and walk out ... Walt, of course, plugged ahead, he didn&#x27;t believe that. He felt that if you had a solid story, not only laughs in it, but tragedy, it would go.&quot; Both Disney&#x27;s wife Lillian and his brother Roy (who was also his business partner) attempted unsuccessfully to talk him out of it, and movie-industry insiders derisively referred to the film as &quot;Disney&#x27;s Folly&quot; while it was in production.

===Early writing===
The earliest known story outlinetitled &quot;Manuscript&quot;was compiled by staff writer Richard Creedon on August 9, 1934, featuring twenty-one pages of suggestions for characters, scenes, and songs (including &quot;Some Day My Prince Will Come&quot;). At the time, Disney adopted a &quot;wide-ranging approach&quot;, remaining open to any idea that could be proposed; notably, one of the suggestions included Snow White traveling through a series of enchanted sitessuch as the Sleepy Valley, the Morass of Monsters, and the Valley of the Dragonsbefore arriving at the dwarfs&#x27; cottage. Snow White was originally envisioned to be more tomboyish, with the Queen described as &quot;stately, beautiful in the way of a Benda mask ... a cool serene character who demonstrates her fury only in moments of great passion.&quot; One of the potential storylines developed for &quot;Manuscript&quot; involved the Queen imprisoning the Prince in her dungeon, after seeing his affection for Snow White, with the Prince later fighting his way out of her castle with &quot;tricks that Doug Fairbanks would like to have thought.&quot; Other story suggestions included the Queen having a collection of her former enemies reduced to a few inches in size; a Gilbert and Sullivan-style musical number for the scene where the Queen orders the Huntsman to kill Snow White; and the sequence of the Queen trying to break the mirror upon learning that Snow White has survived, with the mirror detaching itself from the wall and smashing against the Queen after chasing her around the chamber. Disney also decided from the beginning that each of the Seven Dwarfswhom he considered the &quot;strongest lure&quot; of the story because of their comedic potentialshould have a distinctive personality, identified by a respective name; a pool of over fifty possibilities was compiled for &quot;Manuscript&quot; (with names such as Sleepy, Hoppy, Bashful, Happy, Sneezy-Wheezy, Biggo-Ego, and Awful as the top contenders).

In October 1934, Disney began holding weekly story meetings with a small unit of writers, which included Creedon, Larry Morey, Ted Sears, Albert Hurter, and Pinto Colvig. During the first meeting on October 3, several scenes were proposed: the &quot;Soup Eating&quot; (where Snow White has dinner with dwarfs) and &quot;Bed Building&quot; (where dwarfs build a bed for Snow White) sequences; Snow White teaching the dwarfs to pray; and the climactic scene of the dwarfs chasing the disguised Queen, followed by her death from falling off a cliff. For the next meeting, held on October 9, a typed sheet was complied, featuring a redefined selection of names for the dwarfsWheezy, Jumpy, Baldy, Grumpy, Happy, Doc, and Sleepyand their respective characteristics; several alternatives were also suggested, including Hickey, Sniffy, Stuffy, Shorty, Burpy, Tubby, Dizzy, and Dopey. From the outset, Disney decided to discard the part from the Grimms&#x27; original story where the Queen tries to kill Snow White with a tightly laced bodice, but considered retaining the other two attempts (with a poisoned comb and a poisoned apple), both of which were discussed at the meeting. The storyline of the Prince&#x27;s imprisonment by the Queen, first introduced in &quot;Manuscript&quot;, was also elaborated: after failing to kill Snow White with the comb, the Queen would throw the Prince into a dungeon and use magic to make the skeletons of her previous victims dance for him (identifying one skeleton as &quot;Prince Oswald&quot;). When the disguised Queen would have left for the dwarfs&#x27; cottage with the poisoned apple, Snow White&#x27;s bird friends were to help the Prince escape from the dungeon, fight the Queen&#x27;s guards, and find his horse; the Prince would then go after the Queen, taking the wrong road in the process. Other discussions included the dwarfs&#x27; discovery of Snow White in their cottage; two disguises for the Queena &quot;fat, bulgy&quot; peddler and a &quot;thin, hawk-faced&quot; witchfor each of her attempts to kill Snow White; and the scene of Snow White kissing the dwarfs goodbye before they leave for work. At the meeting, Disney also insisted that the writers refer to the dwarfs as &quot;seven little men&quot;, which was maintained for the rest of the production.

Other examples of the more comical nature of the story at this point included suggestions for a &quot;fat, batty, cartoon type, self-satisfied&quot; Queen. The Prince was also more of a clown and was to serenade Snow White in a more comical fashion. Walt Disney encouraged all staff at the studio to contribute to the story, offering five dollars for every &#x27;gag&#x27;; such gags included the dwarfs&#x27; noses popping over the foot of the bed when they first meet Snow White.

Disney became concerned that such a comical approach would lessen the plausibility of the characters and, sensing that more time was needed for the development of the Queen, advised in an outline circulated on November 6 that attention be paid exclusively to &quot;scenes in which only Snow White, the Dwarfs, and their bird and animal friends appear&quot;. The names and personalities of the dwarfs, however, were still &quot;open to change&quot;. A meeting of November 16 resulted in another outline entitled &#x27;Dwarfs Discover Snowwhite&#x27;, which introduced the character of Dopey, who would ultimately prove to be the most successful of the dwarf characterizations. In the original storyboard, Dopey was very talkative, but no suitable voice actors could be found. Mel Blanc was given a try without success. It was suggested to make him mute instead. For the rest of 1934, Disney further developed the story by himself, finding a dilemma in the characterization of the Queen, who he felt could no longer be &quot;fat&quot; and &quot;batty&quot;, but a &quot;stately beautiful type&quot;, a possibility already brought up in previous story meetings.

===Reworking===
Disney did not focus on the project again until the autumn of 1935. It was believed that the &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; short &quot;The Goddess of Spring&quot; (1934) may have placed doubt in his studio&#x27;s abilities to animate a realistic girl. Apparently, a three-month trip to Europe that summer restored his confidence. At this point, Disney and his writers focused on the scenes in which Snow White and the dwarfs are introduced to the audience and each other. He laid out the likely assignments for everyone working on the film in a memorandum of November 25, 1935 and had decided on the personalities of the individual dwarfs.

It had first been thought that the dwarfs would be the main focus of the story, and many sequences were written for the seven characters. However, at a certain point, it was decided that the main thrust of the story was provided by the relationship between the Queen and Snow White. For this reason, several sequences featuring the dwarfs were cut from the film. The first, which was animated in its entirety before being cut, showed Doc and Grumpy arguing about whether Snow White should stay with them. Another, also completely animated, would have shown the dwarfs eating soup noisily and messily; Snow White unsuccessfully attempts to teach them how to eat &#x27;like gentlemen&#x27;. A partially-animated sequence involved the dwarfs holding a &quot;lodge meeting&quot; in which they try to think of a gift for Snow White; this was to be followed by the elaborate &#x27;bed-building sequence&#x27;, in which the dwarfs and the forest animals construct and carve a bed for the princess. This was also cut, as it was thought to slow down the movement of the story. The soup-eating and bed-building sequences were animated by Ward Kimball, who was sufficiently discouraged by their removal to consider leaving the studio; Disney, however, persuaded him to stay by promoting Kimball to supervising animator of Jiminy Cricket in his next feature &quot;Pinocchio&quot; (1940).

===Casting===
Adriana Caselotti was the first to be tested for the role of Snow White in September 1934. She was invited to audition after Disney&#x27;s casting director Roy Scott telephoned her father (who was a vocal coach in Los Angeles) in search for voice talents, and Caselotti, overhearing their conversation, recommended herself for the part. Although Walt Disney was impressed with her voice, he auditioned about 150 other actresses and singers; these included Deanna Durbin, whom Disney rejected because he thought she sounded too mature. Virginia Davis was nearly hired to provide the speaking voice of Snow White (as well as the live-action reference for the character), but eventually dropped out due to finding the contract unacceptable, although some of Davis&#x27; miscellaneous vocal tracks were used in the final film. Caselotti was cast as Snow White in September 1935, exactly one year after her first audition, and recorded her first tracks on January 20, 1936. She was called in for forty-four days of recording sessions within two years, receiving $20 for each day (in total, Caselotti was paid $970). Thelma Hubbard provided Snow White&#x27;s screams in the forest flight scene and later voiced the character in the film&#x27;s 1938 Spanish dub and Lux Radio Theatre adaptation.

The studio auditioned over a dozen actresses for the role of the Queen before Lucille La Verne was chosen, although several members of Disney&#x27;s staff contended that she sounded a &quot;little old&quot; for the part. Having portrayed similar characters in &quot;Orphans of the Storm&quot; (1921) and &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; (1935), La Verne also tried out for the role of the Witch, and the animators initially felt that her voice was &quot;too smooth and not rough enough&quot; until she removed her false teeth. &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; marks La Verne&#x27;s final film performance before her death in 1942. Kenny Baker was temporarily considered for the role of the Prince, with several other actors tested, before Harry Stockwell was cast in 1936. Reginald Barlow and Cy Kendall recorded the preliminary dialogue for the Huntsman, but both were deemed unsatisfactory for the final cut; the role was eventually given to Stuart Buchanan (who was hired by the studio as casting director and dialogue coach in 1936).

Story meeting notes from October 9, 1934, indicate that Eddie Holden and Billy Bletcher were initially considered for the role of Doc until Atwell was cast in early 1936. Radio actor John Gibson initially auditioned for the part of Sleepy and recorded some dialogue at a prerecording session in February 1936. After reading about the casting in a &quot;Variety&quot; article, Gilbert, who was known for his signature sneeze, telephoned Disney to try out for the role. Disney agreed to audition him and, upon witnessing Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;sneezing routine&quot;, hired him on the spot.

===Animation===
====Art direction====
&quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; features contributions from three European artists who came to work at the Walt Disney Studios in the 1930s. By 1936, Albert Hurter was assigned to supervise the film&#x27;s art direction; all the designs used in the film, from character costume designs to layouts and backgrounds, had to meet his approval before being finalized. Having had an academic art training, Hurter was instrumental in devising the film&#x27;s overall Germanic look, incorporating European illustrations and painting techniques into the animation. Ferdinand Horvath, who had been working at the studio since 1934, was also hired as the film&#x27;s inspirational sketch artist, providing a number of dark concepts for the film. Many of his other designs were ultimately rejected since they were less easily translated into animation than Hurter&#x27;s, and Hovarth didn&#x27;t receive a credit for the film. By the spring of 1936, as the animation process begun, Hurter and Hovarth were joined by Gustaf Tenggren. Tenggren was used as a color stylist and to determine the staging and atmosphere of many of the scenes in the film, as his style borrowed from the likes of Arthur Rackham and John Bauer and thus possessed the European illustration quality that Walt Disney sought. He also designed the posters for the film and illustrated the press book. Other artists to work on the film included Joe Grant, whose most significant contribution was the design for the Queen&#x27;s Witch form.

====Character animation====

Art Babbitt, an animator who joined the Disney studio in 1932, invited seven of his colleagues (who worked in the same room as him) to come with him to an art class that he himself had set up at his home in the Hollywood Hills. Though there was no teacher, Babbitt had recruited a model to pose for him and his fellow animators as they drew. These &quot;classes&quot; were held weekly; each week, more animators would come. After three weeks, Walt Disney called Babbit to his office and offered to provide the supplies, working space and models required if the sessions were moved to the studio. Babbitt ran the sessions for a month until animator Hardie Gramatky suggested that they recruit Don Graham, an art teacher from the Chouinard Institute. Graham taught his first class at the studio on November 15, 1932, and was joined by Philip L. Dike a few weeks later. These classes were principally concerned with human anatomy and movement, though instruction later included action analysis, animal anatomy and acting.

Though the classes were originally described as a &quot;brutal battle&quot;, with neither instructor nor students well-versed in the other&#x27;s craft, the enthusiasm and energy of both parties made the classes stimulating and beneficial for all involved. Graham often screened Disney shorts and, along with the animators, provided critique featuring both strengths and weaknesses. For example, Graham criticised Babbitt&#x27;s animation of Abner the mouse in &quot;The Country Cousin&quot; as &quot;taking a few of the obvious actions of a drunk without coordinating the rest of the body&quot;, while praising it for maintaining its humour without getting &quot;dirty or mean or vulgar. The country mouse is always having a good time&quot;.

Very few of the animators at the Disney studio had had artistic training (most had been newspaper cartoonists); among these few was Grim Natwick, who had trained in Europe. The animator&#x27;s success in designing and animating Betty Boop for Fleischer Studios showed an understanding of human female anatomy and, when Walt Disney hired Natwick, he was given female characters to animate almost exclusively. Attempts to animate Persephone, the female lead of &quot;The Goddess of Spring&quot;, had proved largely unsuccessful; Natwick&#x27;s animation of the heroine in &quot;Cookie Carnival&quot; showed greater promise, and the animator was eventually given the task of animating Snow White herself. Though live action footage of Snow White, the Prince and the Queen was shot as reference for the animators, the artists&#x27; animators disapproved of rotoscoping, considering it to hinder the production of effective caricature. Nevertheless, all of the above-mentioned characters were fully rotoscoped and utilized by their respective artists, some more, some less. Despite Graham and Natwick&#x27;s objections, however, some scenes of Snow White and the Prince were directly traced from the live-action footage.

It proved difficult to add color to Snow White&#x27;s and the Queen&#x27;s faces. Eventually, they found a red dye that worked and which was added with a small piece of cotton wrapped around a tipple pencil on each individual cel. Helen Ogger, an employee at the ink department, was also an animator and decided to use the same system used in animation. The method was so time-consuming that it was never used again on the same scale. It was also used to a smaller degree in &quot;Pinocchio&quot; and &quot;Fantasia&quot; but, after Ogger left the studio in 1941, there was no one else with the same skills who could replace her.

=== Music and records ===

The songs in &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; were composed by Frank Churchill and Larry Morey. Paul J. Smith and Leigh Harline composed the incidental music score. Songs from the film include &quot;Heigh-Ho&quot;, &quot;Someday My Prince Will Come&quot;, and &quot;Whistle While You Work&quot;. Since Disney did not have its own music publishing company at the time, the publishing rights for the music and songs were administered through Bourne Co. Music Publishers, which continues to hold these rights. In later years, the studio was able to acquire back the music rights from many of their other films, but not &quot;Snow White&quot;, &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, &quot;Dumbo&quot; or most &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; cartoons. &quot;Snow White&quot; became the first American film to have a soundtrack album, released in conjunction with the feature film.

=== Cinematic influences ===
At this time, Disney also encouraged his staff to see a variety of films. These ranged from the mainstream, such as MGM&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1936)—to which Disney made direct reference in a story meeting pertaining to the scene in which Snow White lies in her glass coffin—to the more obscure, including European silent cinema. &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; also inspired the balcony scene between Snow White and Prince Charming.

&quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, as well as the two Disney films to follow it, were influenced by such German expressionist films as &quot;Nosferatu&quot; (1922) and &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot; (1920), both of which were recommended by Disney to his staff. This influence is particularly evident in the scenes of Snow White fleeing through the forest and the Queen&#x27;s transformation into the Witch. The latter scene was also inspired by &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; (1931), to which Disney made specific reference in story meetings.

===Financial issues===

Disney had to mortgage his house to help finance the film&#x27;s production, which eventually ran up a total cost of $1,488,422.74, a massive sum for a feature film in 1937. Midway through, Disney needed a $250,000 loan to finish the film. Disney ran a rough cut for Joseph Rosenberg of Bank of America, who sat impassively during the showing. Then Rosenberg turned to the worried Disney and said, &quot;Walt, that thing is going to make a hatful of money&quot; and approved the loan.

==Release==
===Original theatrical run===

&quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; premiered at the Carthay Circle Theatre on December 21, 1937. The film received a standing ovation at its completion from an audience that included Judy Garland, Marlene Dietrich and Charles Laughton. Six days later, Walt Disney and the seven dwarfs appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. Three weeks later, it opened at the Radio City Music Hall in New York City and a theater in Miami in January 1938, in which the strong box office sales encouraged RKO Radio Pictures to place the film into general release on February 4. It became a major box-office success, becoming the most successful sound film of all time, in which it displaced Al Jolson&#x27;s &quot;The Singing Fool&quot; (1928). &quot;Snow White&quot; would soon be displaced from this position by &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; in 1939.

&quot;Snow White&quot; proved equally popular with foreign audiences. It premiered in London on February 24, 1938, ironically the same night as Charles Laughton&#x27;s first film as a producer, &quot;Vessel of Wrath&quot;, leading to a poor turnout for the latter. In September 1938, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that the film was having a remarkably long box-office run at theaters in Sydney, Australia. In that city, it noted, &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s &#x27;Snow White&#x27; (RKO) experienced no difficulty at hitting 11 weeks, with more ahead.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; reported as well that &quot;Snow White&quot; was having even longer runs in other cities overseas, such as in London, where the film had generated greater box-office receipts than during its exclusive New York screenings at Radio City Music Hall:

According to RKO, &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; had earned $7,846,000 in international box office receipts by the end of its original theatrical run. This earned RKO a profit of $380,000.

=== Re-releases ===
&quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; was first re-released in 1944, to raise revenue for the Disney studio during the World War II period. This re-release set a tradition of re-releasing Disney animated features every few years, and &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; was re-released to theaters in 1952, 1958, 1967, 1975, 1983, 1987 and 1993. Coinciding with the 50th-anniversary release in 1987, Disney released one of many authorized novelizations of the story, this one written by children&#x27;s author Suzanne Weyn.

In 1993, &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; became the first film to be entirely scanned to digital files, manipulated, and recorded back to film. The restoration project was carried out entirely at 4K resolution and 10-bit color depth using the Cineon system (10 bits each of red, green and blue—30 in total) to digitally remove dirt and scratches.

&quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; has had a lifetime gross of $418 million across its original release and several reissues. Adjusted for inflation, and incorporating subsequent releases, the film still registers one of the top-10 American film moneymakers of all time, and is the highest-grossing animated film.

As part of Disney&#x27;s 100th anniversary, the film was re-released in cinemas across the UK on August 4, 2023, for one week.

=== Critical reaction ===
The film was a tremendous critical success, with many reviewers hailing it as a genuine work of art, recommended for both children and adults. Although film histories often state that the animation of the human characters was criticized, more recent scholarship found that contemporary reviewers praised the realistic style of the human animation, with several stating that audiences had forgotten that they are watching animated humans rather than real ones. Frank S. Nugent of &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt that &quot;Mr. Disney and his technical crew have outdone themselves. The picture more than matches expectations. It is a classic, as importantly cinematically as &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; or the birth of Mickey Mouse. Nothing quite like it has been done before; and already we have gone impolite enough to clamor for an encore.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; observed that &quot;[so] perfect is the illusion, so tender the romance and fantasy, so emotional are certain portions when the acting of the characters strikes a depth comparable to the sincerity of human players, that the film approaches real greatness.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; wrote &quot;Snow White&quot; was &quot;entertainment that should be enjoyed by every one. Intelligent adults will marvel at the mechanical ingenuity that went into the making of it; and it is something to marvel at, for at times the characters seem lifelike. That is brought about by the expert synchronization of the action with the music and the dialogue.&quot;

At the 11th Academy Awards, the film won an Academy Honorary Award for Walt Disney &quot;as a significant screen innovation which has charmed millions and pioneered a great new entertainment field&quot;. Disney received a full-size Oscar statuette and seven miniature ones, presented to him by 10-year-old child actress Shirley Temple. The film was also nominated for Best Musical Score. &quot;Some Day My Prince Will Come&quot; has become a jazz standard that has been performed by numerous artists, including Buddy Rich, Lee Wiley, Oscar Peterson, Frank Churchill, and Oliver Jones; it was also the title for albums by Miles Davis, by Wynton Kelly, and Alexis Cole.

Noted filmmakers such as Sergei Eisenstein and Charlie Chaplin praised &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; as a notable achievement in cinema; Eisenstein went so far as to call it the greatest film ever made. The film inspired Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to produce its own fantasy film, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, in 1939.

=== Critical re-evaluation and industry recognition ===
&quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; is referred by many critics as one of the greatest animated films in history. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it fourth on its list of the greatest animated films of all time, calling it the one that &quot;changed the future of animation.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine ranked the film as the 13th best animated film of all time. &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; listed the film as the number one animated film of all time, crediting it as the one that started it all.

In 1987, Snow White was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame, making her the only Disney Princess to do so.

The American Film Institute (AFI), an independent non-profit organization created in the United States by the National Endowment for the Arts, releases a variety of annual awards and film lists recognizing excellence in filmmaking. The AFI 100 Years... series, which ran from 1998 to 2008, created categorized lists of America&#x27;s best movies as selected by juries composed from among over 1,500 artists, scholars, critics, and historians. A film&#x27;s inclusion in one of these lists was based on the film&#x27;s popularity over time, historical significance and cultural impact. &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; was selected by juries for inclusion on many AFI lists, including the following:

* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Movies – No. 49
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) – No. 34
* AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10 – No. 1 Animated film
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains: The Queen – No. 10 Villain
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Songs: &quot;Someday My Prince Will Come&quot; – No. 19

The new remaster was scanned from the original 35mm Technicolor negative through a multi-year effort by Disney&#x27;s Restoration and Preservation team and key members of Walt Disney Animation Studios, including Eric Goldberg, Michael Giaimo, Dorothy McKim, and Bob Bagley, all of whom also worked on the 4K remaster of &quot;Cinderella&quot; (1950). On the process, Goldberg remarked &quot;The opportunity to help restore &quot;Snow White&quot; was both an honor and a challenge ... we owed a debt to history to get it looking as beautiful and as accurate to the original colors as we could.&quot; This version also began streaming on Disney+ on October 16, 2023.

== Legacy ==
Following the film&#x27;s release, a number of &quot;Snow White&quot; themed merchandise were sold, including hats, dolls, garden seeds, and glasses. The film&#x27;s merchandise generated sales of , equivalent to over adjusted for inflation. The film&#x27;s intellectual property has been franchised across a diverse range of mediums, including a Broadway musical, video games, and theme park rides.

&quot;Snow White&#x27;s&quot; success led to Disney moving ahead with more feature-film productions. Walt Disney used much of the profits from &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; to finance a new $4.5 million studio in Burbank – the location on which The Walt Disney Studios is located to this day. Within two years, the studio completed &quot;Pinocchio&quot; and &quot;Fantasia&quot; and had begun production on features such as &quot;Dumbo&quot;, &quot;Bambi&quot;, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Peter Pan&quot;.

The film&#x27;s copyright was renewed in 1965, and as a published work from 1937 it will enter the American public domain on January 1, 2033.

=== Canceled prequel ===
In the 2000s, DisneyToon Studios began development on a computer-animated prequel to &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, titled &quot;The Seven Dwarfs&quot;. Director Mike Disa and screenwriter Evan Spiliotopoulos pitched a story explaining how the Dwarfs met, and how the Evil Queen killed Snow White&#x27;s father and took the throne. According to Disa, DisneyToon management changed the prequel&#x27;s plot to center around how Dopey lost his voice upon witnessing the death of his mother. After Disney purchased Pixar in 2006, John Lasseter, DisneyToons&#x27; new Chief Creative Officer, canceled &quot;The Seven Dwarfs&quot;.

Kaufman and published by Weldon Owen on October 16, 2012.

=== Live-action adaptation ===

In October 2016, a live-action adaptation of &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; was announced. The script will be written by Erin Cressida Wilson; while Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, who also wrote new song material for the 2019 live action adaptation of &quot;Aladdin&quot;, will write new songs for the project. In 2019, Marc Webb had signed on as director. Principal photography was originally scheduled to begin in March 2020, in Vancouver, but filming was then delayed to the summer or fall of 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In May 2021, it was reported that Webb was still attached to direct the film but would not begin work on it until later that year, owing to his schedule with the TV series &quot;Just Beyond&quot;. On June 22, 2021, Rachel Zegler was cast as Snow White, and production was slated to begin in 2022. Filming took place in the United Kingdom, beginning March 2022. &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; reported on November 3, 2021, that Gal Gadot is in final negotiations to portray the Evil Queen. Gadot confirmed her casting during the premiere of the film &quot;Red Notice&quot;. During that month, it was reported that Greta Gerwig had worked on the most recent draft on the film&#x27;s script. On January 12, 2022, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; reported that Andrew Burnap had been cast in an unspecified &quot;male lead&quot; role, not the prince or huntsman. Peter Dinklage criticized Disney for what he described as &quot;hypocrisy&quot; for being &quot;proud&quot; of casting a Latina actress as Snow White while making a film about &quot;seven dwarfs living in a cave together&quot;. Following Dinklage&#x27;s criticism, Disney announced that the film will use unidentified &quot;magical creatures&quot; in place of them. The film will also simply be titled &quot;Snow White&quot; due to the absence of the Seven Dwarfs. In March 2022, the set of the film caught on fire at Pinewood Studios just before production began. Filming wrapped in July of that year. During that month, Martin Klebba announced that he would be playing Grumpy. In October 2023, Disney shared a first look image of the film confirming that the Seven Dwarfs would indeed be in the film. The cast also includes Jeremy Swift as Doc, George Salazar as Happy, Andy Grotelueschen as Sleepy, Tituss Burgess as Bashful, Jason Kravits as Sneezy, Andrew Barth Feldman as Dopey, and Patrick Page as the Magic Mirror. Additional filming and pick-ups took place in June 2024. The film is scheduled for release on March 21, 2025.

=== Other appearances ===
The Seven Dwarfs made several appearances in shorts, and despite their popularity they were too numerous to animate efficiently. Commissioned shorts &quot;The Standard Parade&quot; (1939), &quot;The Seven Wise Dwarfs&quot; (1941, using mostly recycled footage), &quot;All Together&quot; (1942) and &quot;The Winged Scourge&quot; (1943) all include appearances.

The 1984 film &quot;Gremlins&quot; featured the cartoon in the theater scenes.

At the end of the 2022 Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&quot;, Wanda Maximoff&#x27;s sons can be seen watching &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; on the television in the living room. A clip of the Queen as the Witch appears in the credits sequence of the 2024 MCU television series &quot;Agatha All Along&quot;.

<doc id="76362" wikidata="Q1177897" url="?curid=76362" title="Davis–Monthan Air Force Base">
<text>Davis–Monthan Air Force Base (DM AFB) is a United States Air Force base southeast of downtown Tucson, Arizona. It was established in 1925 as Davis–Monthan Landing Field. The host unit for Davis–Monthan AFB is the 355th Wing (355 WG) assigned to Twelfth Air Force (12AF), part of Air Combat Command (ACC). The base is best known as the location of the Air Force Materiel Command&#x27;s 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (309 AMARG), the aircraft boneyard for all excess military and U.S. government aircraft and aerospace vehicles.

Davis–Monthan Air Force Base is a key ACC installation. The 355th Wing (355 WG) provides A-10 Thunderbolt II close air support and OA-10 forward air controllers to ground forces worldwide. The 355 WG is the host unit, providing medical, logistical, mission and operational support to assigned units. The 355 WG is the sole formal training unit for the A-10 aircraft, providing initial and recurrent training to all U.S. Air Force A-10 and OA-10 pilots, to include those in the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and the Air National Guard (ANG). The 355th is ACC&#x27;s executive agent for INF and START treaty compliance. In October 2018, the 563rd Rescue Group, previously a geographically separated unit of the 23rd Wing at Moody AFB, Georgia, was transferred to the 355th Wing, along with its HC-130J COMBAT KING II and HH-60G Pave Hawk aircraft.

One of the wing&#x27;s tenant units, the 55th Electronic Combat Group (55 ECG), is a geographically separated unit (GSU) of the 55th Wing (55 WG) at Offutt AFB, Nebraska. Tasked to provide offensive counter-information and electronic attack capabilities in support of U.S. and Coalition tactical air, surface, and special operations forces, the 55 ECG unit employs its Lockheed EC-130H Compass Call aircraft worldwide in tactical air operations in war and other contingencies. It also provides initial and recurrent training to all EC-130H Compass Call pilots, navigators, electronic warfare officers, and aircrew.

Two other major tenant units are assigned to the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC). The 943rd Rescue Group (structured as a GSU under AFRC&#x27;s 920th Rescue Wing at Patrick Space Force Base is equipped with HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters and Guardian Angel personnel. The 943 RQG is tasked to provide combat search and rescue (CSAR) and personnel recovery (PR) support worldwide. The 924th Fighter Group, originally a classic associate unt to the 355 FW, now 355 WG, flies the A-10 Thunderbolt II and is now equipped with its own aircraft.

Perhaps the most prominent tenant is the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (309 AMARG) of the Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC). As the main location for the 309 AMARG, Davis–Monthan AFB is the sole aircraft boneyard for excess military and U.S. government aircraft and other aerospace vehicles such as ballistic missiles. Tucson&#x27;s dry climate and alkali soil make it an ideal location to store and preserve aircraft; more than 4,000 military aircraft are parked on the base.

==History==
The base was named in honor of World War I pilots Lieutenants Samuel H. Davis (1896–1921) and Chief Engineer Oscar Monthan (1885–1924), both Tucson natives. Monthan enlisted in the Army as a private in 1917, was commissioned as a ground officer in 1918, and later became a pilot; he was killed in the crash of a Martin B2 bomber in Hawaii on March 27, 1924.

=== Namesakes ===

==== Samuel Howard Davis ====
First Lieutenant Samuel Howard Davis (November 20, 1896 – December 28, 1921) was a pilot and United States Army Air Service officer. Born to Sam and Effie Davis in 1896 in Dyer County, Tennessee, Davis was known by his middle name, Howard. He attended public schools in Tucson. As a young man, his hobbies included horseback riding and shooting; he was a good marksman.

Davis enrolled at Texas A&amp;M College in 1915 as a student of mechanical engineering, having previously attended the University of Arizona in Tucson. After enlisting in the military in 1917, he was briefly assigned to Fort Hauchuca in Arizona before being transferred to College Station, Texas, to complete his academic studies. He returned to the military after graduation in 1918, assembling airplanes at Kelly Field in San Antonio, Texas. He trained pilots during the first World War, including some pilots who took down German planes. He reached the rank of Second Lieutenant. Davis was honorably discharged from the military about 1919 with the rank of First Lieutenant in the reserve corps. For a time he worked commercial aviation as a manager with the Arizona Aviation Company, where he piloted Orioles and standard manufacture airplanes. Davis married Marjorie Cameron of San Antonio in 1920.

Davis returned to the Army Air Service in August 1921. He died in a military aircraft accident completing a training mission on December 28, 1921, while a passenger in a Curtiss JN-6HG at Carlstrom Field, near Arcadia, Florida. One other person, William C. Sinclair, was also killed. They were hunting ducks at the time; Sinclair was piloting and Davis was shooting. After a funeral at the home of his parents, Davis was buried at Evergreen Cemetery in Tucson. He was survived by his widow, his parents, and a brother, Wilton.

Davis&#x27;s father was in attendance at the 1925 dedication of the base, as was Governor G.W.P. Hunt, who spoke at the dedication.

===Origins===
In 1919, the Tucson Chamber of Commerce aviation committee established the nation&#x27;s first municipally owned airfield at the current site of the Tucson Rodeo Grounds. The rapid increase in aviation activities meant a move in 1927 to the site which is now Davis–Monthan Air Force Base. The City of Tucson acquired land southeast of town for a runway and dedicated the field in 1925. Charles Lindbergh, fresh from his nonstop crossing of the Atlantic Ocean, flew his &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; to Tucson in 1927 to dedicate the airport at Davis–Monthan Field, then the largest municipal airport in the United States.

Military presence at the field began when Sergeant Simpson relocated his fuel and service operation to the site on 6 October 1927. He kept a log containing names of the field&#x27;s customers, including Lindbergh, Amelia Earhart, Benjamin Foulois, and Jimmy Doolittle. Doolittle, awarded the Medal of Honor for his 1942 Tokyo raid, was the first military customer at the field on 9 October 1927. The combination of civil and military operations worked well until the early 1940s, when military requirements began to require the relocation of civil aviation activities.

===World War II===
Davis–Monthan Airport became Tucson Army Air Field in 1940, as the United States prepared for World War II. The first assigned U.S. Army Air Corps units were the 1st Bomb Wing, 41st Bomb Group and 31st Air Base Group, activating on 30 April 1941 with Lieutenant Colonel Ames S. Albro Sr. as commanding officer. In its military role, the base became known as Davis–Monthan Army Air Field on 3 December 1941. U.S. Army Air Forces leaders then utilized the airfield for heavy bomber operation, sending Douglas B-18 Bolo, Consolidated B-24 Liberator, and Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers, for training and observation missions.

Among the bombardment groups trained at the base during the war:
* 34th Bombardment (Heavy) 13 May – 4 July 1942
* 94th Bombardment (Heavy) August – 1 November 1942
* 302nd Bombardment (Heavy) 23 June – 30 July 1942
* 308th Bombardment (Heavy) 20 June – 1 October 1942
* 380th Bombardment (Heavy) 4 November – 2 December 1942
* 382nd Bombardment (Heavy) 23 January – 5 April 1943
* 389th Bombardment (Heavy) 24 December 1942 – 1 February 1943
* 392nd Bombardment (Heavy) 26 January – 1 March 1943
* 399th Bombardment (Heavy) 1 March – 10 April 1943
* 400th Bombardment (Heavy) April – 2 May 1943

* 446th Bombardment (Heavy) 1 April – 8 June 1943
* 449th Bombardment (Heavy) 1 May – 5 July 1943
* 451st Bombardment (Heavy) 1 May – 3 June 1943
* 459th Bombardment (Heavy) 20 September – 1 November 1943
* 466th Bombardment (Heavy) 15 August – 17 October 1945
* 486th Bombardment (Heavy) 9 November 1943 – March 1944
* 489th Bombardment (Heavy) 3 April – 13 July 1945
* 491st Bombardment (Heavy) 1 October – 11 November 1943
* 444th Bombardment (Very Heavy) 1 March – 29 July 1943
* 499th Bombardment (Very Heavy) 20 November – 1 December 1943
Training at the airfield came to a halt on 14 August 1945, when the Japanese surrendered. Davis–Monthan played a post-war role by housing German POWs from June 1945 to March 1946. It also served as a separation center, which brought the base populace to a high of 11,614 in September 1945.

With the end of the war, operations at the base came to a virtual standstill. It was then that the base was selected as a storage site for hundreds of decommissioned aircraft, with the activation of the 4105th Army Air Force Unit. The 4105th oversaw the storage of excess B-29s and C-47 &quot;Gooney Birds.&quot; Tucson&#x27;s low humidity and alkali soil made it an ideal location for aircraft storage and preservation, awaiting cannibalization or possible reuse—a mission that has continued to this day.

===Cold War===
===Strategic Air Command===
The Cold War era was ushered in at Davis–Monthan on 21 March 1946, with the installation placed under the claimancy of the recently established Strategic Air Command (SAC). SAC&#x27;s presence at the base began in the form of the 40th and 444th Bombardment Groups, both equipped with B-29s. As part of the postwar austerity, these groups were later inactivated, with the personnel and equipment being consolidated into the 43d Bombardment Group in October. On 11 January 1948, with the establishment of the United States Air Force as independent service four months earlier, the facility was renamed Davis–Monthan Air Force Base. On 30 June 1948, the Air Force activated the 43rd Air Refueling Squadron, whose KB-29Ms were newly equipped with aerial refueling equipment purchased from the British firm FRL. The 43rd ARS, along with the 509th ARS at Walker AFB, New Mexico, was the first dedicated air refueling unit in history.

On 2 March 1949, the &quot;Lucky Lady II&quot;, a B-50A of the 43d Bombardment Wing, completed the first nonstop round-the-world flight, having covered in 94 hours and 1 minute (249.45 mph). &quot;Lucky Lady II&quot; was refueled four times in the air by KB-29 tankers of the 43d Air Refueling Squadron, which had made only one operational air refueling contact before the mission. For this outstanding flight, the &quot;Lucky Lady II&quot;″s crew received the Mackay Trophy, given annually by the National Aeronautic Association for the outstanding flight of the year, and the Air Age Trophy, an Air Force Association award, given each year in recognition of significant contributions to the public understanding of the air age.

In 1953, the jet age came to Davis–Monthan when SAC units on the base converted to the new Boeing B-47 Stratojet. The 303d Bombardment Wing, Medium, was initially established on 27 August 1951, and activated at Davis–Monthan AFB on 4 September 1951. The wing operated B-29s until January 1952, when it was equipped with KB-29s. On 20 January 1953, the 303d transitioned to the Boeing B-47 Stratojet for its three bomb squadrons, while an additional air refueling squadron equipped with KC-97s was assigned to the wing between 18 February 1953, and 1 February 1956. A standard SAC Alert Area ramp was constructed in the southeast corner of the base adjacent to the runway and the 303d assumed nuclear alert responsibilities when final conversion and checkout in the B-47 was complete.

In April 1953, the Air Defense Command&#x27;s (ADC) 15th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron was activated with F-86A Sabres. A year later, the unit transitioned into F-86Ds followed by a transition to F-86Ls in the fall of 1957. In the spring of 1959 the unit received Northrop F-89J interceptors which it flew for only a year when it transitioned into McDonnell F-101Bs. On 24 December 1964, the 15th FIS was inactivated.

In 1962, the Strategic Air Command&#x27;s 390th Strategic Missile Wing (390 SMW) and its 18 Titan II ICBM sites around Tucson were activated. The 390 SMW was one of only three Titan II missile wings in SAC and represented the heaviest land-based missile and the largest single warhead ever fielded by U.S. strategic deterrent forces.

In July 1963, the 4028th Strategic Reconnaissance Weather Wing, equipped with U-2 strategic reconnaissance aircraft, began flying global missions from Davis–Monthan. Following the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1963, the 4080th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing at Laughlin AFB, Texas, relocated to the base and assumed responsibility for all U-2 operations, emphasizing long-range strategic reconnaissance and intelligence collection. As a Strategic Air Command (SAC) unit, the 4080th was later redesignated the 100th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing and also acquired Lockheed DC-130 Hercules aircraft for launch and control of Firebee reconnaissance drones that were the precursors of contemporary unmanned aerial systems. The DC-130s and U-2s remained at the Davis–Monthan until 1976, when the 100 SRW was inactivated, its DC-130s transferred to Tactical Air Command&#x27;s 432d Tactical Drone Group, and its U-2s transferred to SAC&#x27;s 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing (9 SRW) at Beale Air Force Base, California, where U-2 Dragon Lady operations were consolidated with SR-71 Blackbird operations.

On 15 June 1964, Davis–Monthan&#x27;s 303d Bombardment Wing was inactivated as part of the retirement of the B-47 Stratojet from active service. The year 1964 brought back the combat crew training mission of the World War II years with the 4453d Combat Crew Training Wing of the Tactical Air Command equipped with the Air Force&#x27;s newest and most sophisticated fighter, the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II. In July 1971, the 355th Tactical Fighter Wing, flying the A-7 Corsair II aircraft, was activated at the base and the previously assigned F-4s were moved to Luke AFB, near Phoenix, Arizona.

===Tactical Air Command===
On 1 October 1976, the base was transferred to Tactical Air Command (TAC) after 30 years under SAC, with SAC&#x27;s 390th Strategic Missile Wing becoming a tenant command of the base. It was also that year the 355th Tactical Fighter Wing accepted the first A-10 Thunderbolt II. Since 1979, D–M has been the training location for pilots in the A-10; the base was redesignated the 355th Tactical Training Wing on 1 September 1979. The organization was later redesignated the 355th Fighter Wing since it includes operational, deployable A-10 squadrons in addition to its CONUS training mission

The 1980s brought several diverse missions to D–M. The headquarters charged with overseeing them was now the 836th Air Division, which was activated 1 January 1981. The AD advised Air Force component commanders and land forces on A-10 aircraft tactics, training, employment and readiness, and subordinate units participated in exercises such as Red Flag and Celtic Echo.

The 41st Electronic Combat Squadron equipped with the EC-130H Compass Call aircraft, arrived on 1 July 1980, and reported to the 552d Airborne Warning and Control Wing. In 1981 D–M welcomed the 868th Tactical Missile Training Group (866 TMTG). The 868th was the only U.S.-based Ground Launched Cruise Missile (GLCM) unit and the source of the crews that staffed the forward deployed GLCM wings in NATO in 1982.

On 1 September 1982, the headquarters of the 602d Tactical Air Control Wing (TAIRCW) and its subordinate 23rd Tactical Air Support Squadron (TASS), a unit responsible for the Air Force&#x27;s tactical air control system west of the Mississippi River transferred from Bergstrom Air Force Base, Texas, and stood up at D–M, bringing 16 OA-37B aircraft and numerous new personnel to the base. The 23rd TASS became the Air Force&#x27;s first O/A-10 squadron in 1988, providing heavily armed airborne forward air control (FAC) capability for the first time. Unlike all other D–M aircraft at the time, the 23rd TASS fleet&#x27;s tail flash read &quot;NF&quot;, for &quot;Nail FAC&quot;; the squadron&#x27;s radio call sign was &quot;Nail&quot;.

In 1984, as a result of the first series of Strategic Arms Reduction Treaties START I between the United States and the Soviet Union, SAC began to decommission its Titan II missile system. In 1982, the 390 SMW began removing its 18 missiles and inactivating the associated sites in preparation for eventual demolition.

In October 1981, President Ronald Reagan announced that, as part of the strategic modernization program, Titan II systems were to be retired by 1 October 1987. Deactivation began at Davis–Monthan on 1 October 1982. During the operation, titled &quot;Rivet Cap&quot;, the missiles were removed and shipped to Norton AFB, California for refurbishment and storage. Explosive demolition began at the headworks of missile complex 570–7 on 30 November 1983. In May 1984, the 390 SMW&#x27;s last Titan II at Davis–Monthan came off alert status. SAC subsequently inactivated the 390th Strategic Missile Wing on 30 June 1984.

One site under the 390 SMW, known both as Titan II Site 571-7 and as Air Force Facility Missile Site 8, was initially decommissioned in 1982. Located approximately south of Tucson in Sahuarita, Arizona, it was saved from demolition and turned over to the Arizona Aerospace Foundation, a nonprofit organization which also administers the Pima Air and Space Museum immediately south of Davis–Monthan AFB. With a variety of items on loan from the National Museum of the United States Air Force, including an inert Titan II missile, Site 571-7 is now known as the Titan Missile Museum and is one of two remaining examples of a Titan II missile site in existence (the other being located at Vandenberg Space Force Base, California; site 395-C). In 1994, the site was declared a National Historic Landmark.

In 1987, the 71st Special Operations Squadron, an Air Force Reserve unit flying HH-3 Jolly Green Giants, was activated at the base. While it served after the invasion of Kuwait in Desert Shield/Storm, it did not survive the end of the Cold War drawdown, and disbanded in 1992.

===Post-Cold War era===
In the 1990s, the 355 TTW continued to train A-10 crews for assignments to units in the United States, England, and Korea. During this period, the 602nd Tactical Air Control Wing deployed Airborne Forward Air Controllers in their OA-10 aircraft to Operation Desert Storm, providing nearly 100 percent of this capability to the war.

On 1 October 1991, the 355 TTW was redesignated as the 355th Fighter Wing (355 FW) in tune with the Air Force&#x27;s Objective Wing philosophy. The 355th Fighter Wing was composed of the 355th Operations Group (355 OG), the 355th Maintenance Group (355 MG), the 355th Medical Group (355 MDG), and the 355th Mission Support Group (355 MSG).

In May 1992, the 41st and 43d Electronic Combat Squadrons, flying EC-130H Hercules Compass Call arrived. The aircraft carried an airborne battlefield command and control center capsule that provides continuous control of tactical air operations in the forward battle area and behind enemy lines. This capability added yet more strength to the wing&#x27;s combat capability. The 43rd Electronic Combat Squadron &quot;Bats&quot; are part of the 55th Wing at Offutt AFB, Nebraska, but operate out of Davis–Monthan. In addition, the 42d Airborne Command and Control Squadron arrived from Keesler AFB, Mississippi on 19 July 1994.

On 1 May 1992, senior Air Force leaders implemented the policy of one base, one wing, one boss. The 836 AD and 602 TAIRCW inactivated (the later on 15 June 1992) while the 41 ECS and 43 ECS came under control of the 355 FW. With the mission diversified, the 355th Fighter Wing was re-designated as the 355th Wing (355 WG).

===Air Combat Command===
On 1 June 1992, Tactical Air Command was inactivated and all aircraft, personnel and installations previously under TAC were transferred to the newly established Air Combat Command (ACC) on the same date. Following Operation Desert Storm, the 355 WG supported Operation Southern Watch during deployments to Al Jaber, Kuwait, in 1997 by deploying 24 A-10s, in 1998 by deploying 16 A-10s, and in 1999 by deploying 14 A-10s—all to ensure compliance of the 33rd parallel southern no-fly zone. The flight and mysterious crash of Captain Craig D. Button took off from Davis–Monthan Air Force Base on 12 April 1997.

===Global War on Terrorism, 2001–2007===
The attacks on 11 September 2001, led to the initiation of three ongoing missions: Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), and Operation Noble Eagle (ONE). After Operation Enduring Freedom, eight A-10s from the 355 WG were called to Bagram Airfield, Afghanistan, to fly close air support missions supporting multinational ground forces.

In September 2002, the 48th, 55th, and the 79th Rescue Squadron&#x27;s (RQS) transferred under control of the 355 WG, equipped with HC-130 aircraft and HH-60 helicopters. At the same time, the 41st and 43d Electronic Combat Squadrons were realigned under the control of the 55th Electronic Combat Group (55 ECG). While personnel and aircraft remained on Davis–Monthan AFB, operational control of the 55 ECG was assumed by the 55th Wing at Offutt AFB, Nebraska. Another major wing realignment occurred on 1 October 2003, with the activation of the 563rd Rescue Group (563 RQG) on Davis–Monthan AFB. Control of the 48th, 55th, and 79th Rescue Squadrons (RQS) was passed to the new group with the 23rd Wing (23 WG) at Moody Air Force Base, Georgia assuming operational command of the unit.

In 2003 and 2005, the 354th Fighter Squadron (354 FS) &quot;Bulldogs&quot; deployed on five-month deployments to Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan. During these deployments, they provided 24-hour presence to reassure the Afghan population as it struggled with its emergent democracy, and provided key support during national elections. While the 2003 deployment saw limited action, the Bulldogs employed over 22,000 rounds of 30 mm during 130 troops-in-contact situations during the 2005 deployment. Returning to Afghanistan in April 2007 for another six-month deployment, the 345th again provided 24-hour presence and Close Air Support expertise to coalition forces in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. During this period, insurgent activity level was the highest recorded to date in OEF. The Bulldogs employed an unprecedented number of munitions during this deployment—over 150,000 rounds of 30 mm in support of over 400 troops-in-contact situations.

===2007–present===
On 26 April 2007, the 355th Wing was re-designated as the 355th Fighter Wing (355 FW) with only A-10 fighter aircraft assigned. Also in 2007, the 214th Reconnaissance Group (214 RG), an Arizona Air National Guard unit, was activated. As of October 2020, the 355 FW is composed of four groups: the 355th Operations Group (355 OG), the 355th Maintenance Group (355 MG), the 355th Mission Support Group (355 MSG), and the 355th Medical Group (355 MDG). Along with their tenant organizations, they make up the 6,100 airmen and 1,700 civilian personnel at Davis–Monthan AFB. The 355th Fighter Wing was re-designated 355th Wing on January 2, 2019. On 20 August 2020, the 355th Wing again realigned and now falls under the 15th Air Force Headquarters at Shaw AFB, SC.

On 1 October 2021, the 418th Test and Evaluation Squadron was activated at David-Monthan to provide test and evaluation of new tactics, techniques and procedures for the EC-130H Compass Call and HC-130J Combat King II.

<text>Some Like It Hot is a 1959 American crime comedy film directed, produced and co-written by Billy Wilder. It stars Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, with George Raft, Pat O&#x27;Brien, Joe E. Brown, Joan Shawlee and Nehemiah Persoff in supporting roles. The screenplay by Wilder and I. A. L. Diamond is based on a screenplay by Robert Thoeren and Michael Logan from the 1935 French film &quot;Fanfare of Love&quot;. The film is about two musicians (Curtis and Lemmon) during the Prohibition era who disguise themselves as women to escape Chicago mobsters they witnessed commit murder.

&quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; opened to critical and commercial success and is considered to be one of the greatest films of all time. The film received six Academy Award nominations, including Best Actor, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay, winning for Best Costume Design. In 1989, the Library of Congress selected it as one of the first 25 films for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

The Production Code had been gradually weakening in its scope since the early 1950s, owing to greater social tolerance for taboo topics in film, but it was enforced until the mid-1960s. The overwhelming success of &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; is considered one of the reasons behind the retirement of the code.

==Plot==

In Prohibition-era Chicago, Joe is a jazz saxophone player and an irresponsible, impulsive gambler and ladies&#x27; man; Jerry, his anxious friend, is a jazz double bass player. They work in a speakeasy owned by local Mafia boss &quot;Spats&quot; Colombo. Tipped off by informant &quot;Toothpick&quot; Charlie, the police raid the joint. Joe and Jerry escape, but later accidentally witness Spats and his henchmen gunning down Toothpick and his gang in revenge (an incident inspired by the Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre). Spats and his gang see them as they flee. Broke, terrified, and desperate to leave Chicago, Joe and Jerry disguise themselves as women named Josephine and Daphne so they can join Sweet Sue and her Society Syncopators, an all-female band headed by train to Miami. On the train, Joe and Jerry befriend Sugar Kane, the band&#x27;s vocalist and ukulele player.

Joe and Jerry become obsessed with Sugar and compete for her affections while maintaining their disguises. Sugar confides to Josephine that she has sworn off male saxophone players, who have taken advantage of her in the past. She hopes to find a gentle, bespectacled millionaire in Florida. Josephine and Daphne become close friends with Sugar during a late-night party on the train and struggle to remember that flirting with her would compromise their cover.

After arriving in Miami, Joe woos Sugar by posing as oil heir Shell Oil Junior and affecting a Cary Grant-esque accent while feigning indifference to her. The aging, multi-divorcee Osgood Fielding III, an actual millionaire, persistently pursues Daphne, whose refusals only fuel his desire. After Osgood invites Daphne to dinner on his yacht, Joe convinces Jerry to keep Osgood occupied onshore so that Junior can be alone with Sugar on Osgood&#x27;s yacht and pass it off as his own. On the yacht, Junior tells Sugar that psychological trauma from the death of a former lover has left him impotent, but that he would immediately marry anyone who could cure him. Sugar tries to arouse him, with considerable success. Meanwhile, Daphne and Osgood dance the tango (la cumparsita) until dawn. When Joe and Jerry get back to the hotel, Jerry announces that Osgood has proposed marriage to Daphne and that he has accepted, anticipating a divorce and cash settlement when his ruse is revealed. Joe convinces Jerry that he cannot marry Osgood.

The hotel hosts a conference for the Friends of Italian Opera Society, a front for a national Mafia meeting presided over by Little Bonaparte. Spats and his men arrive and soon recognize Joe and Jerry, still in disguise as the witnesses they have been looking for. Fearing for their lives, Joe and Jerry realize they must quit the band and leave the hotel. Joe conceals his deception from Sugar by telling her over the telephone that Junior must marry a woman of his father&#x27;s choosing and move to Venezuela. Sugar becomes distressed and heartbroken. Joe and Jerry evade Spats&#x27; men by hiding under a table at the syndicate banquet, where Little Bonaparte has Spats and his gang gunned down. Joe and Jerry are spotted and they flee through the hotel. Joe, still dressed as Josephine, sees Sugar onstage singing a lament to lost love. After Joe runs onto the stage and kisses her, Sugar realizes that Josephine and Junior are the same person.

Jerry persuades Osgood to take Daphne and Josephine away on his yacht. Sugar runs from the stage at the end of her song and jumps aboard Osgood&#x27;s launch just as it is leaving the dock. Joe confesses the truth to Sugar and tells her that she deserves better, but Sugar wants him anyway, realizing he is the first man to genuinely care for her. Meanwhile, Jerry tries to get out of his engagement by listing reasons why Daphne and Osgood cannot marry, none of which bother Osgood. Exasperated, Jerry rips off his wig and says &quot;I&#x27;m a man!&quot; in his normal voice; still smiling, Osgood replies &quot;Well, nobody&#x27;s perfect,&quot; confounding Jerry and leaving him speechless.

==Cast==

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack features four songs performed by Marilyn Monroe, nine songs composed by Adolph Deutsch, and two songs performed by jazz artist Matty Malneck.

== Production ==
===Pre-production===
Billy Wilder wrote the script for the film with writer I. A. L. Diamond. The plot was based on a screenplay by Robert Thoeren and Michael Logan for the 1935 French film &quot;Fanfare of Love&quot;. The original script for &quot;Fanfare of Love&quot; was untraceable, so Walter Mirisch found a copy of the 1951 German remake, &quot;Fanfares of Love&quot;. He bought the rights to that script, and Wilder worked with this to produce a new story. Both films follow the story of two musicians in search of work, but Wilder created the gangster subplot.

The studio hired female impersonator Barbette to coach Lemmon and Curtis. Monroe worked for 10 percent of the gross in excess of $4 million, Curtis for 5 percent of the gross over $2 million, and Wilder for 17.5 percent of the first million after break-even and 20 percent thereafter.

===Casting===
Tony Curtis was spotted by Billy Wilder while he was making the film &quot;Houdini&quot; (1953), and he thought Curtis would be perfect for the role of Joe. &quot;I was sure Tony was right for it&quot;, said Wilder, &quot;because he was quite handsome, and when he tells Marilyn that he is one of the Shell Oil family, she has to be able to believe it&quot;. Wilder&#x27;s first idea for the role of Jerry was Frank Sinatra, but he later thought he would be too difficult. Jerry Lewis and Danny Kaye were also considered for the role of Jerry. Lewis was offered the role, but declined as he didn&#x27;t want to do drag, a decision he would later regret. Finally, Wilder saw Lemmon in the comedy &quot;Operation Mad Ball&quot; and selected him for the part. Wilder and Lemmon would go on to make numerous films together, including &quot;The Apartment&quot; and several films which also included Walter Matthau.

According to York Film Notes, Wilder and Diamond did not expect a star as big as Marilyn Monroe to take the part of Sugar. &quot;Mitzi Gaynor was who we had in mind&quot;, Wilder said. &quot;The word came that Marilyn wanted the part and then we to have Marilyn.&quot; Curtis stated that everyone told Wilder not to cast Monroe as she was too difficult to work with. Wilder and Monroe had previously worked together on &quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot; in 1955.

It was George Raft&#x27;s first &quot;A&quot; picture in a number of years.

===Filming===
The film was made in California during the summer and autumn of 1958. AFI reported the production dates between early August and November 12, 1958, at Samuel Goldwyn Studios. Many scenes were shot at the Hotel del Coronado in Coronado, California, which appeared as the &quot;Seminole Ritz Hotel&quot; in Miami in the film, as it fit into the era of the 1920s and was near Hollywood. The Mirisch Company was the film&#x27;s presenter, and producer Walter Mirisch employed several crew members from his home base, the Allied Artists studio.

During filming, Monroe lacked concentration and suffered from an addiction to pills. She was constantly late to set, and could not memorize many of her lines, averaging 35–40 takes for a single line according to Tony Curtis. The line &quot;It&#x27;s me, Sugar&quot; took 47 takes to get correct because Monroe kept getting the word order wrong, saying either &quot;Sugar, it&#x27;s me&quot; or &quot;It&#x27;s Sugar, me&quot;. Curtis and Lemmon made bets during the filming on how many takes she would need to get it right. Three days were scheduled for shooting the scene with Shell Jr. and Sugar at the beach, as Monroe had many complicated lines, but the scene was finished in only 20 minutes. Monroe&#x27;s acting coach Paula Strasberg and Monroe&#x27;s husband Arthur Miller both tried to influence the production, which Wilder and other crew members found annoying.

Wilder spoke in 1959 about making another film with Monroe: &quot;I have discussed this with my doctor and my psychiatrist and they tell me I&#x27;m too old and too rich to go through this again.&quot; But Wilder also admitted: &quot;My Aunt Minnie would always be punctual and never hold up production, but who would pay to see my Aunt Minnie?&quot; He also stated that Monroe played her part wonderfully. Years later, Wilder noted &quot;I think there are more books on Marilyn Monroe than there are on World War 2, and there&#x27;s a great similarity.&quot;

The film&#x27;s closing line, &quot;Well, nobody&#x27;s perfect&quot;, is ranked 78th on &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; list of Hollywood&#x27;s 100 Favorite Movie Lines, but it was never supposed to be in the final cut. Diamond and Wilder put it in the script as a &quot;placeholder&quot; until they could come up with something better, but they never did. Wilder&#x27;s tombstone pays homage to the line by reading, &quot;I&#x27;m a writer, but then, nobody&#x27;s perfect&quot;. In 2000, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked the closing scene at No. 10 on their list of &quot;The top 100 film moments&quot;.

===Style===
With regard to sound design, there is a &quot;strong musical element&quot; in the film, with the soundtrack created by Adolph Deutsch. It has an authentic 1920s jazz feel using sharp, brassy strings to create tension in certain moments, for example whenever Spats&#x27;s gangsters appear. In terms of cinematography and aesthetics, Wilder chose to shoot the film in black and white as Lemmon and Curtis in full drag costume and make-up looked &quot;unacceptably grotesque&quot; in early color tests. Despite Monroe&#x27;s contract requiring the film to be in color, she agreed to it being filmed in black and white after seeing that Curtis and Lemmon&#x27;s makeup gave them a &quot;ghoulish&quot; appearance on color film. Orry-Kelly created the costumes for Monroe as well as Lemmon and Curtis, after the stock costumes the studio provided for the male leads fit poorly.

==Reception==
===Box office===

By 1962, &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; had grossed $14 million in the US. According to The Numbers, the film ultimately grossed $25 million in the US. As of 2020, it had grossed over $83.2 million internationally.

The film opened in the week ended March 24, 1959, in several cities in the United States; the highest grossing of which were in Chicago, where it grossed $45,000 at the United Artists Theatre with Monroe making an appearance, and in Washington, D.C., where it grossed $40,000 at the Capitol Theatre. With results from just six key cities, &quot;Variety&quot; listed it as the third highest-grossing film in the United States for the week.

The film then expanded to 100 theatres around the country for the Easter holiday, including at the newly renovated State Theatre in New York City on Sunday, March 29, 1959, and became number one in the country and remained there for three weeks before being knocked off the top by &quot;Imitation of Life&quot;. &quot;Imitation of Life&quot; was top for two weeks before being replaced again by &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot;, which remained there for another four weeks before being replaced by &quot;Pork Chop Hill&quot;. In its first month, the film grossed $2,585,120 from 96 engagements.

===Retrospective appraisal===
&quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; received widespread acclaim from critics and is considered among the best films of all time. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 95% of 73 critics have given the film a positive review, with an average rating of 9.1/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus calls it &quot;a spry, quick-witted farce that never drags.&quot; According to Metacritic, another review aggregator which calculated a weighted average score of 98 out of 100 based on 19 critics, the film received &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. The &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;″s Roger Ebert wrote: &quot;Wilder&#x27;s 1959 comedy is one of the enduring treasures of the movies, a film of inspiration and meticulous craft.&quot; Ebert gave the film four stars out of four and included it in his Great Movies list. John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; referred to the film as &quot;a jolly, carefree enterprise&quot;. Richard Roud, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 1967, called it &quot;close to perfection&quot;.

In 1989, the film became one of the first 25 inducted into the United States National Film Registry. In 1998, the film was ranked at No. 7 in &quot;Time Out&quot;″s poll of Top 100 Films. In 1999, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; voted it at No. 9 on their list of &quot;100 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot;.

&quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; was voted as the top American comedy film by the American Film Institute on their list on AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs poll in 2000, and was selected as the best comedy of all time in a poll of 253 film critics from 52 countries conducted by the BBC in 2017. In 2005, the British Film Institute included this film on its list of &quot;Top fifty films for children up to the age of 14&quot;. The 2022 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; critics&#x27; poll ranked it as the 38th greatest film of all time, tied with &quot;Rear Window&quot; and &quot;a bout de souffle&quot;. The 2022 Sight &amp; Sound directors&#x27; poll ranked it 62nd, tied with nine other films. In the earlier 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; polls, it was ranked the 42nd-greatest film ever made in the critics&#x27; poll and 37th in the directors&#x27; poll. The 2002 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; polls the film ranked 37th among critics and 24th among directors. In 2010, &quot;The Guardian&quot; considered it the third-best comedy film of all time. In 2015, the film ranked 30th on BBC&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest American Films&quot; list, voted on by film critics from around the world. It was included in &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s &quot;The Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made&quot; list in 2002. In 2005, it was included on &quot;Time&quot;″s All-Time 100 best movies list. The film was voted at No. 52 on the list of &quot;100 Greatest Films&quot; by the French film magazine &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot; in 2008. In July 2018, it was screened in the Venice Classics section at the 75th Venice International Film Festival.

According to film historian Foster Hirsch, during a screening of the film at Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre in March 1959, &quot;Joe E. Brown&#x27;s nonchalant delivery of the final line elicited the loudest, deepest, heartiest laughter I have ever heard in a theater...recognizing a perfectly timed one-liner for the ages, a thousand spectators roared in unified delight.&quot;

==Adaptations==
An unsold television pilot was filmed by Mirisch Productions in 1961 featuring Vic Damone and Tina Louise. As a favor to the production company, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis agreed to film cameo appearances, returning as their original characters, Daphne and Josephine, at the beginning of the pilot. Their appearance sees them in a hospital where Jerry (Lemmon) is being treated for his impacted back tooth and Joe (Curtis) is the same O blood type.

In 1975 a Bollywood remake was released as &quot;Rafoo Chakkar&quot;.

A 1984 stage production at the Claridge Hotel &amp; Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, starred Joe Namath as Joe.

A 1991 stage production of this show in London featured Tommy Steele and retained the film&#x27;s title.

Tony Curtis, then in his late 70s, performed in a 2002 stage production of the film, this time cast as Osgood Fielding III, the character originally played by Joe E. Brown.

=== Broadway ===
The 1972 musical &quot;Sugar&quot;, based on the film screenplay, opened on Broadway starring Elaine Joyce, Robert Morse, Tony Roberts, and Cyril Ritchard, with book by Peter Stone, lyrics by Bob Merrill, and (all-new) music by Jule Styne.

On January 5, 2019, Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman confirmed they were writing the music and lyrics for a new adaptation in an interview with Graham Norton on BBC Radio 2. The version had aimed for a Broadway production in 2020, but was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. On April 20, 2022, the production was confirmed to star Christian Borle at the Shubert Theatre with previews beginning November 1, 2022, with music by Shaiman, music and lyrics by Shaiman and Wittman, and book by Matthew Lopez and Amber Ruffin. The Broadway production went on to win four Tony Awards at the 76th annual ceremony in 2023: Casey Nicholaw for Best Choreography, Charlie Rosen &amp; Bryan Carter for Best Orchestrations, Gregg Barnes for Best Costume Design of a Musical, and J. Harrison Ghee for Best Leading Actor in a Musical. Ghee was the first openly non-binary actor to be both nominated for and to win a Tony Award, along with Alex Newell, who won for their role in &quot;Shucked&quot;.

<doc id="76367" wikidata="Q3238185" url="?curid=76367" title="Stormy Weather (song)">
<text>&quot;Stormy Weather&quot; is a 1933 torch song written by Harold Arlen and Ted Koehler. Ethel Waters first sang it at The Cotton Club night club in Harlem in 1933 and recorded it with the Dorsey Brothers&#x27; Orchestra under Brunswick Records that year, and in the same year it was sung in London by Elisabeth Welch and recorded by Frances Langford. Also in 1933, for the first time the entire floor revue from Harlem&#x27;s Cotton Club went on tour, playing theatres in principal cities. The revue was originally called &quot;The Cotton Club Parade of 1933&quot; but for the road tour it was changed to &quot;Stormy Weather Revue&quot;; it contained the song &quot;Stormy Weather&quot;, which was sung by Adelaide Hall.

In September 1933, the group Comedian Harmonists released their German cover version, titled &quot;Ohne Dich&quot; (&quot;Without You&quot;) with lyrics that are quite different. The song has since been performed by Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland, Etta James, Ella Fitzgerald, Dinah Washington, Clodagh Rodgers, Reigning Sound, Lena Horne, Billie Holiday, The Spaniels, Willie Hutch, Jeff Lynne, Bob Dylan and others. Leo Reisman&#x27;s orchestra version had the biggest hit on records (with Arlen himself as vocalist), although Ethel Waters&#x27; recorded version also sold well. &quot;Stormy Weather&quot; was performed by Horne in the 1943 film &quot;Stormy Weather&quot;, a big, all-star show for World War II soldiers.

The song tells of disappointment, as the lyrics, &quot;Don&#x27;t know why there&#x27;s no sun up in the sky&quot;, show someone pining for her man to return. The weather is a metaphor for the feelings of the singer: &quot;stormy weather since my man and I ain&#x27;t together, keeps raining all the time&quot;.

The original handwritten lyrics, along with a painting by Ted Koehler, were featured on the US version of &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; on January 24, 2011, where they were appraised for between $50,000 and $100,000. The lyrics show a number of crossings out and corrections.

Ethel Waters&#x27; recording of the song in 1933 was inducted in the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2003, and the Library of Congress added it to the National Recording Registry in 2004. Also in 2004, Horne&#x27;s version finished at number 30 on AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs survey of top tunes in American movies.

According to the Acoustic Music organization, the version by the Five Sharps (1952) &quot;is one of the rarest of all R&amp;B records. Only three 78rpm and no 45rpm copies are known to exist&quot;.

==Notable recordings==
*Ethel Waters – 1933

*Lena Horne recorded the song in 1941 for RCA Victor. In 1943, she recorded another version for the movie &quot;Stormy Weather&quot;. She recorded the song at least five times throughout her career, including for the 1957 album &quot;Stormy Weather&quot;. Her original 1941 version of the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2000.
*Billie Holiday with Lester Young and Count Basie – &quot;Broadcast Performances Vol. 2&quot; (1955)
*Red Garland Trio - &quot;All Kinds of Weather&quot; (1959), familiar to listeners of American Public Media&#x27;s Marketplace radio program, which plays Garland&#x27;s version as background accompaniment whenever news of a decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average is reported

<text>Sunset Boulevard is a 1950 American dark comedy film noir directed by Billy Wilder and co-written by Wilder, Charles Brackett and D. M. Marshman Jr. It is named after a major street that runs through Hollywood.

The film stars William Holden as Joe Gillis, a struggling screenwriter, and Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond, a former silent-film star who draws him into her deranged fantasy world, where she dreams of making a triumphant return to the screen. Erich von Stroheim plays Max von Mayerling, her devoted butler, and Nancy Olson, Jack Webb, Lloyd Gough, and Fred Clark appear in supporting roles. Director Cecil B. DeMille and gossip columnist Hedda Hopper play themselves, and the film includes cameo appearances by silent-film stars Buster Keaton, H. B. Warner, and Anna Q. Nilsson.

Praised by many critics when first released, &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; was nominated for 11 Academy Awards (including nominations in all four acting categories) and won three. It is often ranked among the greatest movies ever made. As it was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the U.S. Library of Congress in 1989, &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; was included in the first group of films selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. In 1998, it was ranked number 12 on the American Film Institute&#x27;s list of the 100 best American films of the 20th century. In 2007, it was 16th on their 10th Anniversary list.

== Plot ==
At a mansion on Sunset Boulevard, police officers and photographers discover the body of Joe Gillis floating face down in the swimming pool. In a flashback, Joe relates the events leading to his death.

Six months earlier, Joe, a down-on-his-luck screenwriter, tries to interest Paramount Pictures in a story he submitted. Script reader Betty Schaefer harshly critiques it, unaware that Joe is listening. Later, while fleeing from repo men seeking his car, Joe turns into the driveway of a seemingly deserted mansion inhabited by forgotten silent film star Norma Desmond. Learning that Joe is a writer, Norma asks his opinion of a script she has written for a film about Salome. She plans to play the role herself in her return to the screen. Joe finds her script abysmal but flatters her into hiring him as a script doctor.

Joe moves into Norma&#x27;s mansion at her insistence and sees that Norma refuses to believe that her fame has evaporated. Her butler, Max, secretly writes all of the fan mail she receives in order to maintain the illusion. At her New Year&#x27;s Eve party, Joe realizes that she has fallen in love with him. He tries to let her down gently, but Norma slaps him and retreats to her room, distraught. Joe visits his friend Artie Green and again meets Betty, who thinks a scene in one of Joe&#x27;s scripts has potential. When he phones Max to have him pack his things, Max tells him Norma has cut her wrists with his razor. Joe then returns to Norma, and their relationship becomes sexual.

Norma has Max deliver the edited &quot;Salome&quot; script to her former director Cecil B. DeMille at Paramount. She starts getting calls from Paramount executive Gordon Cole but refuses to speak to anyone except DeMille. Eventually, she has Max drive her and Joe to Paramount in her 1929 Isotta Fraschini. DeMille welcomes her affectionately and treats her with great respect but tactfully evades her questions about the script. Max then learns that Cole only called her because he wants to rent her Isotta Fraschini for use in a film.

Preparing for her imagined comeback, Norma undergoes rigorous beauty treatments. Joe secretly works nights in Betty&#x27;s office, collaborating on an original screenplay, and she eventually confesses she has fallen for him. After learning of Joe&#x27;s moonlighting, Max reveals he was once a respected film director who discovered Norma, made her a star, and became her first husband. Following their divorce, he abandoned his career to become her servant.

Norma discovers a manuscript with Joe and Betty&#x27;s names on it and phones Betty, insinuating that Joe is not the man he seems. Overhearing the call, Joe invites Betty to the mansion to see for herself. When she arrives, he pretends that he is satisfied being a gigolo so that she can be with Artie. However, after she tearfully leaves, he packs to return to his old newspaper job in Dayton, Ohio. He bluntly informs Norma that there will be no comeback, that Max writes all of her fan mail, and that she has been forgotten, though Max refuses to break her delusions. Joe disregards Norma&#x27;s threat to kill herself as she brandishes a gun; as he leaves the house, Norma shoots him three times, and he collapses into the pool.

The flashback ends, and the film returns to the present day, with Norma about to be arrested for murder. The mansion is overrun with police and reporters with newsreel cameras, which she believes are film cameras. Max pretends to &quot;direct&quot; her, and the police play along. As the cameras roll, Norma descends the grand staircase. Upon reaching the bottom, she stops and makes an impromptu speech about how happy she is to be making a film again. She then says, &quot;Alright, Mr. DeMille, I&#x27;m ready for my close-up.&quot; and approaches the camera.

==Cast==
==Production==

===Background===
The street known as Sunset Boulevard has been associated with Hollywood film production since 1911, when the town&#x27;s first film studio, Nestor, opened there. The film workers lived modestly in the growing neighborhood, but during the 1920s, profits and salaries rose to unprecedented levels. With the advent of the star system, luxurious homes noted for their often incongruous grandeur were built in the area.

As a young man living in Berlin in the 1920s, Billy Wilder was interested in American culture, with much of his interest fueled by the country&#x27;s films. In the late 1940s, many of the grand Hollywood houses remained, and Wilder, then a Los Angeles resident, found them to be a part of his everyday world. Many former stars from the silent era still lived in them, although most were no longer involved in the film business. Wilder wondered how they spent their time now that &quot;the parade had passed them by&quot; and began imagining the story of a star who had lost her celebrity and box-office appeal.

The character of Norma Desmond mirrors aspects of the twilight years of several real-life faded silent-film stars, such as the reclusive existences of Mary Pickford and Pola Negri and the mental disorders of Mae Murray, Valeska Surratt, Audrey Munson and Clara Bow. Dave Kehr has asserted that Norma Talmadge is &quot;the obvious if unacknowledged source of Norma Desmond, the grotesque, predatory silent movie queen&quot; of the film. The most common analysis of the character&#x27;s name is that it is a combination of the names of silent film actress Mabel Normand and director William Desmond Taylor, a close friend of Normand&#x27;s who was murdered in 1922 in a never-solved case sensationalized by the press.

===Writing===

Cinematographer John Seitz stated that Wilder &quot;had wanted to do Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s 1948 novel &quot;The Loved One&quot;, but couldn&#x27;t obtain the rights.&quot; Waugh&#x27;s story follows a failed screenwriter who lives with a silent film star and works in a cemetery. Gossip columnist Hedda Hopper, who plays herself in the movie, wrote that &quot;Billy Wilder ... was crazy about Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s book &quot;The Loved One&quot;, and the studio wanted to buy it.&quot; Regardless, the plans for this adaptation fell through. The original script that followed nevertheless contains similarities to the novel. At one point, Norma mistakes Joe for a funeral director and inquires about a coffin for herself and her deceased pet chimp.

Wilder and Brackett began working on a script in 1948, but the result did not completely satisfy them. In August 1948, D. M. Marshman Jr., formerly a writer for &quot;Life&quot;, was hired to help develop the storyline after Wilder and Brackett were impressed by a critique he provided of their film &quot;The Emperor Waltz&quot; (1948). In an effort to keep the full details of the story from Paramount Pictures and avoid the restrictive censorship of the Breen Code, they submitted the script a few pages at a time. The Breen Office insisted certain lines be rewritten, such as Gillis&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m up that creek and I need a job,&quot; which became &quot;I&#x27;m over a barrel. I need a job.&quot; Paramount executives thought Wilder was adapting a story called &quot;A Can of Beans&quot; (which did not exist) and allowed him relative freedom to proceed as he saw fit. Only the first third of the script was written when filming began in early May 1949, and Wilder was unsure how the film would end.

The fusion of writer-director Billy Wilder&#x27;s biting humor and the classic elements of film noir make for a strange kind of comedy, as well as a strange kind of film noir. There are no belly laughs here, but there are certainly strangled giggles: at the pet chimp&#x27;s midnight funeral, at Joe&#x27;s discomfited acquiescence to the role of gigolo; at Norma&#x27;s Mack Sennett-style &quot;entertainments&quot; for her uneasy lover; and at the ritualized solemnity of Norma&#x27;s &quot;waxworks&quot; card parties, which feature such former luminaries as Buster Keaton as Norma&#x27;s has-been cronies.

Wilder preferred to leave analysis of his screenplays and films to others. When asked if &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; was a black comedy, he replied: &quot;No, just a picture&quot;.

===Casting===

According to Brackett, Wilder and he never considered anyone except Gloria Swanson for the role of Norma Desmond. Wilder, however, recalled first wanting Mae West and Marlon Brando for the leads. West rejected the offer outright. West portrayed herself as a sex symbol through her senior years, and was offended that she should be asked to play a Hollywood has-been.

The filmmakers approached Greta Garbo, whom they had worked with previously on &quot;Ninotchka&quot; (1939), but she was not interested. Wilder contacted Pola Negri by telephone, but had a difficult time understanding her heavy Polish accent. He then reached out to Clara Bow, the famed &quot;It girl&quot; of the 1920s, but she declined, having found the transition to sound films so difficult that she preferred to leave her film career behind her. They also offered the part of Norma Desmond to Norma Shearer, but she rejected the role due to both her retirement and distaste for the script. They were considering Fred MacMurray to play opposite her as Joe. Wilder and Brackett then visited Mary Pickford, but before even discussing the plot with her, Wilder realized she would consider a role involving an affair with a man half her age an insult, so they departed. They had considered pairing Montgomery Clift with her.

According to Wilder, he asked George Cukor for advice, and he suggested Swanson, one of the most fêted actresses of the silent-screen era, known for her beauty, talent, and extravagant lifestyle. In many ways, she resembled the Norma Desmond character, and like her, had been unable to make a smooth transition into talking pictures. The similarities ended there; Swanson made a handful of talking pictures. She accepted the end of her film career and, in the early 1930s, moved to New York City, where she worked in radio. In the mid-1940s, she worked in television and on the New York stage and had last appeared in the 1941 film &quot;Father Takes a Wife&quot;. Though Swanson was not seeking a movie comeback, she became intrigued when Wilder discussed the role with her.

Swanson was glad for the opportunity to earn a greater salary than she had been making in television and on stage. However, she was chagrined at the notion of submitting to a screen test, saying she had &quot;made 20 films for Paramount. Why do they want me to audition?&quot; Her reaction was echoed in the screenplay when Norma Desmond declares, &quot;Without me there wouldn&#x27;t be any Paramount studios.&quot; In her memoir, Swanson recalled asking Cukor if it was unreasonable to refuse the screen test. He replied that since Norma Desmond was the role for which she would be remembered, &quot;If they ask you to do ten screen tests, do ten screen tests, or I will personally shoot you.&quot; His enthusiasm convinced Swanson to participate, and she signed a contract for $50,000 (). In a 1975 interview, Wilder recalled Swanson&#x27;s reaction with the observation, &quot;There &quot;was&quot; a lot of Norma in her, you know.&quot;

Wilder harks back to Swanson&#x27;s silent film career when Norma shows Joe the film &quot;Queen Kelly&quot;, an earlier Gloria Swanson film directed by Erich von Stroheim, who himself portrays Norma&#x27;s butler and former director and husband Max von Mayerling. &quot;Queen Kelly&quot; was not released in the United States for over 50 years after Swanson walked off the set.

Montgomery Clift was signed to play Joe Gillis for $5,000 per week for a guaranteed twelve weeks, but withdrew just before the start of filming, claiming his role of a young man involved with an older woman was too close to the one he had played in &quot;The Heiress&quot; (1949), in which he felt he had been unconvincing. An infuriated Wilder responded, &quot;If he&#x27;s any kind of actor, he could be convincing making love to &quot;any&quot; woman.&quot; Clift himself was having an affair with singer Libby Holman, 15 years his senior, which some have suggested was his real reason for withdrawing from the film.

Forced to consider the available Paramount contract players, Wilder and Brackett focused on William Holden, who had made an impressive debut a decade earlier in &quot;Golden Boy&quot; (1939). Following an appearance in &quot;Our Town&quot; (1940), he served in the military in World War II, and his return to the screen afterward had been moderately successful. Holden was enthusiastic about the script and eager to accept the role. He did not know at the time that his salary of $39,000 () was much less than had been offered to Clift.

For the role of Betty Schaefer, Wilder wanted a newcomer who could project a wholesome and ordinary image to contrast with Swanson&#x27;s flamboyant and obsessive Desmond. He chose Nancy Olson, who had recently been considered for the role of Delilah in Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s &quot;Samson and Delilah.&quot;

DeMille, often credited as the person most responsible for making Swanson a star, plays himself, with his scenes filmed on the set of &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; at Paramount Studios. He calls Norma &quot;young fella&quot;, which had been his nickname for Swanson.

Norma&#x27;s friends who come to play bridge with her, referred to by Joe as &quot;the waxworks&quot;, were Swanson&#x27;s silent-era contemporaries Buster Keaton, Anna Q. Nilsson, and H. B. Warner, portraying themselves. Hedda Hopper also played herself, reporting on Norma Desmond&#x27;s downfall in the film&#x27;s final scenes.

===Cinematography and design===

The film&#x27;s dark, shadowy black-and-white cinematography was the work of John F. Seitz. Wilder had worked with Seitz on several projects before, and trusted his judgment, allowing him to make his own decisions. Seitz recalled asking Wilder what he required for the pet chimpanzee&#x27;s funeral scene, to which Wilder replied, &quot;you know, just your standard monkey funeral shot.&quot; For some interior shots, Seitz sprinkled dust in front of the camera before filming to suggest &quot;mustiness,&quot; a technique he had also used for Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; (1944). The film had the option to be shot in color, but it was instead shot in black and white to be more reflective of the noir genre.

Wilder was adamant that the corpse of Joe Gillis be seen from the bottom of the pool, but creating the effect was difficult. The camera was placed inside a specially constructed box and lowered under water, but the result disappointed Wilder, who insisted on further experiments. The shot was finally achieved by placing a mirror on the bottom of the pool and filming Holden&#x27;s reflection from above, with the distorted image of the police officers standing around the pool forming a backdrop.

Film historian Tom Stempel writes: &quot;In both &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; and &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;, Seitz does something that has always impressed me. Both are films noir, and he finesses the fact that both are set in the sunniest of locales, Los Angeles... he brings together the light and the dark in the same film without any seams showing... he brings together the realistic lighting of Joe Gillis out in the real world with the gothic look of Norma Desmond&#x27;s mansion.&quot;

Edith Head designed the costumes. Wilder, Head, and Swanson agreed that Norma Desmond would have kept somewhat up-to-date with fashion trends, so Head designed costumes closely resembling the Dior look of the mid-1940s. Embellishments were added to personalize them and reflect Norma Desmond&#x27;s taste.

Swanson recalled in her biography that the costumes were only &quot;a trifle outdated, a trifle exotic.&quot; Head later described her assignment as &quot;the most challenging of my career,&quot; and explained her approach with the comment, &quot;Because Norma Desmond was an actress who had become lost in her own imagination, I tried to make her look like she was always impersonating someone.&quot; Head later said she relied on Swanson&#x27;s expertise because &quot;she was creating a past that she knew and I didn&#x27;t.&quot; Head also designed the costumes for William Holden and the minor characters, but Wilder instructed von Stroheim and Nancy Olson to wear their own clothing.

The overstated decadence of Norma Desmond&#x27;s home was created by set designer Hans Dreier, whose career extended back to the silent era. He had also been commissioned to complete the interior design for the homes of movie stars, including the house of Mae West. William Haines, an interior designer and former actor, later rebutted criticism of Dreier&#x27;s set design with the observation, &quot;Bebe Daniels, Norma Shearer, and Pola Negri all had homes with ugly interiors like that.&quot;

The bed in the shape of a boat in which Norma Desmond slept had been owned by the dancer Gaby Deslys, who died in 1920. It had originally been bought by the Universal prop department at auction after Deslys&#x27;s death. The bed appeared in &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; (1925) starring Lon Chaney.

Wilder also made use of authentic locales. Joe&#x27;s apartment is in the Alto Nido, a real apartment block in central Hollywood that was often home to struggling writers. It is located at 1851 Ivar Ave. and Franklin Ave. west of the Hollywood Freeway. The scenes of Gillis and Betty Schaefer on Paramount&#x27;s back lot were filmed on the actual studio back lot, and the interior of Schwab&#x27;s Drug Store was carefully recreated for several scenes. The exterior scenes of the Desmond house were filmed at a house on Wilshire Boulevard built during the 1920s by the millionaire William O. Jenkins. Jenkins and his family lived in it for only one year before then leaving it abandoned for more than a decade, which earned it the nickname &quot;Phantom House&quot;. By 1949, it was owned by the former wife of J. Paul Getty. The house was later featured in Nicholas Ray&#x27;s &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; (1955). It was demolished by the Gettys in 1957 to make way for the construction of an office building.

During filming, considerable publicity was given to the health-conscious Gloria Swanson&#x27;s youthful appearance, which made her look the same age as Holden. Wilder insisted that the age difference between the characters be delineated, and instructed makeup supervisor Wally Westmore to make Swanson look older. Swanson argued that a woman of Norma Desmond&#x27;s age, with her considerable wealth and devotion to self, would not necessarily look old, and suggested Holden be made up to appear younger. Wilder agreed, and Westmore was assigned this task, which allowed Swanson to portray Norma Desmond as more glamorous a figure than Wilder had originally imagined.

==Score==
Franz Waxman&#x27;s musical score was the final element added to &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;. His theme for Norma was based on tango music, inspired by her having danced the tango with Rudolph Valentino. This style was contrasted with Joe&#x27;s bebop theme. Waxman also used distorted arrangements of popular film-music styles from the 1920s and 1930s to suggest Norma Desmond&#x27;s state of mind. The film&#x27;s score was recorded for compact disc by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, conducted by Joel McNeely, and released in 2002. The surviving parts of the original score were released in 2010.

A suite from the film&#x27;s score, as well as an arrangement by the conductor John Mauceri of various cues in sonata form are published by Sony Music.

==Original release and responses==

===Previews and revision===
Wilder and Brackett, nervous about a major screening in Hollywood, held a preview in Evanston, Illinois, in late 1949. The original edit opened with a scene inside a morgue, with the assembled corpses discussing how they came to be there. The story began with the corpse of Joe Gillis recounting his murder to the others. The audience reacted with laughter and seemed unsure whether to view the rest of the film as drama or comedy. After a similar reaction during its second screening in Poughkeepsie, New York, and a third in Great Neck, the morgue opening was replaced by a shorter poolside opening, using footage filmed on January 5, 1950.

In Hollywood, Paramount arranged a private screening for the various studio heads and specially invited guests. After viewing the film, Barbara Stanwyck knelt to kiss the hem of Gloria Swanson&#x27;s skirt. Swanson later remembered looking for Mary Pickford, only to be told, &quot;She can&#x27;t show herself, Gloria. She&#x27;s too overcome. We all are.&quot; Louis B. Mayer berated Wilder before the crowd of celebrities, saying, &quot;You have disgraced the industry that made and fed you! You should be tarred and feathered and run out of Hollywood!&quot; Upon hearing of Mayer&#x27;s slight, Wilder strode up to the mogul and retorted with a vulgarity that one biographer said was allegedly because Mayer, who was Jewish, suggested that Wilder, who was also Jewish, would be better off being sent back to Germany, an extraordinary sentiment so soon after the war and the Holocaust, in which Wilder&#x27;s family perished. In 2020 Olson recounted that friends who had attended the screening told her that Wilder had simply told Mayer &quot;Go fuck yourself.&quot;

The few other criticisms were not so venomous. According to one often-told but later discredited anecdote, actress Mae Murray, a contemporary of Swanson, was offended by the film and commented, &quot;None of us floozies was &quot;that&quot; nuts.&quot;

===Premiere and box-office receipts===
&quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; had its official world premiere at Radio City Music Hall on August 10, 1950. After a seven-week run, &quot;Variety&quot; magazine reported the film had grossed &quot;around $1,020,000&quot;, ($ in dollars ) making it one of that theater&#x27;s most successful pictures. &quot;Variety&quot; also noted that, while it was &quot;breaking records in major cities, it is doing below average in ... the sticks.&quot; To promote the film, Gloria Swanson traveled by train throughout the United States, visiting 33 cities in a few months. The publicity helped attract people to the cinemas, but in many areas away from major cities it was considered less than a hit.

The film earned an estimated $2,350,000 at the U.S. box office in 1950 ($ in dollars ).

===Critical response===
Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 98% of critics gave the film a positive review based on 112 reviews, with an average rating of 9.5/10. The critical consensus states: &quot;Arguably the greatest movie about Hollywood, Billy Wilder&#x27;s masterpiece &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; is a tremendously entertaining combination of noir, black comedy, and character study.&quot;

====Contemporary====
&quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; attracted a range of positive reviews from critics. &quot;Time&quot; described it as a story of &quot;Hollywood at its worst told by Hollywood at its best&quot;, while &quot;Boxoffice Review&quot; wrote &quot;the picture will keep spectators spellbound.&quot; James Agee, writing for &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot;, praised the film and said Wilder and Brackett were &quot;beautifully equipped to do the cold, exact, adroit, sardonic job they have done.&quot; &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; described Swanson as a &quot;great lady [who] spans another decade with her magic,&quot; while &quot;Look&quot; praised her &quot;brilliant and haunting performance.&quot;

Some critics accurately foresaw the film&#x27;s lasting appeal. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote that future generations would &quot;set themselves the task of analyzing the durability and greatness&quot; of the film, while &quot;Commonweal&quot; said that in the future &quot;the Library of Congress will be glad to have in its archives a print of &quot;Sunset Boulevard.&quot;&quot;

In a rare negative review of the film, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; deemed it &quot;a pretentious slice of Roquefort&quot; containing only &quot;the germ of a good idea&quot;. Despite praising it as a &quot;great motion picture&quot; with &quot;memorable&quot; acting, Thomas M. Pryor wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the use of the dead Joe Gillis as narrator was a plot device &quot;completely unworthy of Brackett and Wilder&quot;.

====Retrospective====
In 1999, Roger Ebert described Swanson as giving &quot;one of the all time greatest [acting] performances&quot;, but singled out von Stroheim&#x27;s performance as &quot;hold[ing] the film together&quot;. He included it in his Great Movies list, calling it &quot;the best drama ever made about the movies because it sees through the illusions.&quot; Pauline Kael described the film as &quot;almost too clever, but at its best in its cleverness&quot;, and also wrote that it was common to &quot;hear Billy Wilder called the world&#x27;s greatest director.&quot; When Wilder died in 2002, obituaries singled out &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; for comment, describing it as one of his most significant works, along with &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; and &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot;.

Film writer Richard Corliss describes &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; as &quot;the definitive Hollywood horror movie&quot;, noting that almost everything in the script is &quot;ghoulish&quot;. He remarks that the story is narrated by a dead man whom Norma Desmond first mistakes for an undertaker, while most of the film takes place &quot;in an old, dark house that only opens its doors to the living dead&quot;. He compares von Stroheim&#x27;s character Max with the concealed Erik, the central character in &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, and Norma Desmond with Dracula, noting that, as she seduces Joe Gillis, the camera tactfully withdraws with &quot;the traditional directorial attitude taken towards Dracula&#x27;s jugular seductions&quot;. He writes that the narrative contains an excess of &quot;cheap sarcasm&quot;, but ultimately considers it a valuable part of Joe&#x27;s characterization as a hack writer. David Thomson notes the irony of having Gillis tell the story: &quot;The man who can&#x27;t dream up a viable story line becomes the best pitch he&#x27;ll ever hear. He is the story and it is Billy Wilder&#x27;s sour valedictory to let the ghost of Gillis tell the story, facedown in the gelid swimming pool exactly the Hollywood reward that Joe gets only in his dreams. And so this breathtaking portrait of Hollywood failure is wrapped up in rueful, ruined success.&quot;

==Awards and nominations==
Of the various films that have attracted Academy Award nominations in all four acting categories, &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; is one of only three not to win in any category, the others being &quot;My Man Godfrey&quot; (1936) and &quot;American Hustle&quot; (2013). At the time its eleven Oscar nominations were exceeded only by the fourteen received by &quot;All About Eve&quot;, which won six awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. Many critics predicted that the Best Actress award would be given to Gloria Swanson or Bette Davis for &quot;All About Eve&quot; and were surprised that the recipient was newcomer Judy Holliday for &quot;Born Yesterday&quot;. Bette Davis believed that her and Swanson&#x27;s comparable characters effectively &quot;cancelled each other out&quot;, allowing Holliday to win. Swanson recalled the press&#x27;s reaction following Holliday&#x27;s win: &quot;It slowly dawned on me that they were asking for a larger-than-life scene, or better still, a mad scene. More accurately, they were trying to flush out Norma Desmond.&quot;

&quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; was dramatized as an hour-long radio play on the September 17, 1951, broadcast of &quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot; with Gloria Swanson and William Holden in their original film roles.

===Recognition since 1989===
In 1989, the film was among the first group of 25 deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; ranked the film at No. 43 in its Top 250 &quot;Best Films of the Century&quot; list in 1999, based on a poll of critics. The film was included in &quot;&quot;The New York Times&quot; Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made&quot; in 2002. In January 2002, the film was voted at No. 87 on the list of the &quot;Top 100 Essential Films of All Time&quot; by the National Society of Film Critics. &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; received 33 votes in the British Film Institute&#x27;s 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; polls, making it the 63rd greatest film of all time in the critics&#x27; poll and 67th in the directors&#x27; poll. In the earlier 2002 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; polls the film ranked 12th among directors. In 2022 edition of Sight &amp; Sound&#x27;s &quot;Greatest films of all time&quot; list the film ranked 62nd in the director&#x27;s poll. The Writers Guild of America ranked the film&#x27;s screenplay (written by Charles Brackett &amp; Billy Wilder and D.M. Marshman Jr.) the 7th greatest ever. In a 2015 poll by BBC Culture, film critics ranked &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; the 54th greatest American film of all time.

American Film Institute included the film on these lists:
* 1998 – AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Movies – #12
* 2005 – AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes:
** &quot;Alright, Mr. DeMille, I&#x27;m ready for my close-up.&quot; – #7

* 2007 – AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) – #16

==Aftermath==
&quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; was the last collaboration between Wilder and Brackett. They parted amicably and did not publicly air any grievances for the rest of their lives. In later years, Brackett confided in screenwriter/director Garson Kanin that he had not anticipated the split, or had ever understood exactly what happened or why. He described it as &quot;an unexpected blow&quot; from which he never recovered fully; when asked to respond to Brackett&#x27;s comments, Wilder remained silent.

The two men briefly reunited in October 1951 to face charges that they had plagiarized &quot;Sunset Boulevard.&quot; Former Paramount accountant Stephanie Joan Carlson alleged that in 1947 she had submitted to Wilder and Brackett, at their request, manuscripts of stories, both fictional and based on fact, she had written about studio life. She claimed that one in particular, &quot;Past Performance&quot;, served as the basis for the &quot;Sunset&quot; script, and sued the screenwriters and Paramount for $100,000 in general damages, $250,000 in punitive damages, $700,000 based on the box office returns, and an additional $350,000 for good measure, for a total of $1,400,000. Carlson&#x27;s suit was dismissed after two and a half years. In 1954, a similar suit was filed by playwright Edra Buckler, who claimed material she had written had been the screenplay&#x27;s source. Her suit was dismissed the following year.

Brackett&#x27;s Hollywood career continued after his split with Wilder. He won an Academy Award for his screenplay for &quot;Titanic&quot; (1953), and wrote &quot;Niagara&quot; (1953), the breakthrough film for Marilyn Monroe as a dramatic actress. It was Wilder, however, who realized Monroe&#x27;s comedic abilities in &quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot; and &quot;Some Like It Hot.&quot; Brackett&#x27;s career waned by the end of the decade, though he did produce the Oscar-nominated film &quot;The King and I&quot; (1956). He received an Honorary Oscar for Lifetime Achievement in 1958.

William Holden began receiving more important parts and his career rose. He won the Best Actor Oscar for &quot;Stalag 17&quot; (1953), also directed by Wilder, and by 1956 he was the top box-office attraction in the United States. Holden and Wilder also rejoined forces for &quot;Fedora&quot; (1978), another film critical of Hollywood.

Before the film was released, Nancy Olson had grown disenchanted with film as a career partly because the themes of &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; resonated with her, and also because she had become engaged to songwriter Alan Jay Lerner and decided to move to New York with him. Nevertheless, Olson&#x27;s pairing with William Holden was considered a success, and she appeared opposite him in several films during the 1950s, although none of them repeated their earlier success; she returned to Hollywood to make several other films, including &quot;The Absent-Minded Professor&quot; (1961) and &quot;Son of Flubber&quot; (1963), in which she was paired with Fred MacMurray.

Similarly, Gloria Swanson was not able to leverage her own success in &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;. Although offered scripts, she felt that they all were poor imitations of Norma Desmond. Imagining a career that would eventually reduce her to playing &quot;a parody of a parody,&quot; she virtually retired from films.

&quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; was shown again in New York City in 1960, and drew such a positive response that Paramount arranged for a limited re-release in theaters throughout the United States.

Films that discuss &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; in their screenplays or pay homage in scenes or dialogue include &quot;Soapdish&quot; (1991), &quot;The Player&quot; (1992), &quot;Gods and Monsters&quot; (1998), &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; (2001), &quot;Inland Empire&quot; (2006) and &quot;Be Cool&quot; (2005). The ending of &quot;Cecil B. Demented&quot; (2000) is a parody of &quot;Sunset Boulevard&#x27;s&quot; final scene.

==Restoration and home media==
By the late 1990s, most &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; prints were in poor condition, and as the film was shot using cellulose nitrate filmstock, much of the original negative had perished. Paramount Studios, believing the film merited the effort of a complete restoration, mounted an expensive project to have it digitally restored. This restored version was released on DVD in 2002. In 2012, the film was digitally restored by Paramount Pictures for Blu-ray Disc debut. Frame-by-frame digital restoration by Prasad Corporation removed dirt, tears, scratches and other defects.

==Musical adaptations==
===Stapley and Hughes===
From around 1952 to 1956, Gloria Swanson herself worked with actor Richard Stapley (aka Richard Wyler) and cabaret singer/pianist Dickson Hughes on an adaptation titled &quot;Boulevard!&quot; (at first &quot;Starring Norma Desmond&quot;). Stapley and Hughes first approached Swanson about appearing in a musical revue they had written, &quot;About Time&quot; (based on &quot;Time&quot;). Swanson stated that she would return to the stage only in a musical version of her comeback film. Within a week, Stapley and Dickson had written three songs which Swanson approved.

In this version, the romance between Gillis and Schaefer was allowed to blossom, and rather than shoot Gillis at the end, Norma gave the couple her blessing, sending them on their way to live &quot;happily ever after.&quot;

Although Paramount gave verbal permission to proceed with the musical, there was no formal legal option. In the late 1950s, Paramount withdrew its consent, leading to the demise of the project.

In 1994, Dickson Hughes incorporated material from &quot;Boulevard!&quot; into a musical &quot;Swanson on Sunset&quot;, based on his and Stapley&#x27;s experiences in writing &quot;Boulevard!&quot;.

This attempt is chronicled in the 2021 documentary Boulevard! A Hollywood Story.

===Other failed attempts===
Stephen Sondheim briefly considered turning &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; into a musical until meeting Billy Wilder at a cocktail party, who told him that the film would be better adapted as an opera rather than a musical. Hal Prince later approached Sondheim to adapt the film as a musical with Angela Lansbury playing Norma Desmond.

John Kander and Fred Ebb were also approached by Hal Prince to write a musical of &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;.

===Andrew Lloyd Webber===

A musical adaptation with book and lyrics written by Don Black and Christopher Hampton, and music by Andrew Lloyd Webber was staged in 1993 in London, with Patti LuPone playing Norma Desmond. It closely followed the film story, retained much of the dialogue and attempted to present similar set designs. It reached Broadway in 1994, with Glenn Close playing Norma Desmond. The production staged 17 previews beginning November 1, 1994, and played 977 performances at the Minskoff Theatre from November 17, 1994, through March 22, 1997. It was named Best Musical at the 1995 Tony Awards.

In 2016, Close reprised the role in London&#x27;s West End, followed by a 12-week run at the Palace Theater in New York City from February 2 to June 25, 2017.

Sunset Boulevard played one night at the Royal Albert Hall on December 3, 2021. The production was directed by Jordan Murphy and conducted by Alex Parker, and it starred Mazz Murray.

In 2023, Nicole Scherzinger revived the role of Norma Desmond in a 16-week run from September at London&#x27;s Savoy Theatre, in a production directed by Jamie Lloyd. The production transferred to Broadway&#x27;s St. James Theatre with an opening night on October 20, 2024.

A film adaptation of the musical, with Close and Lloyd Webber producing, and Close playing Norma, is in development at Paramount Pictures, with Rob Ashford directing and Tom MacRae writing. Filming was originally set to begin in late 2019, but was delayed three times due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Paramount putting the project on hold in October 2021. In May 2024, Close revealed that the film is still moving forward, but with Ashford no longer attached as director.

==In popular culture==
===Television===
* In 1971, the film was parodied in the fourteenth episode of season five of &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; in a sketch called &quot;Sunnyset Boulevard&quot; in which Carol Burnett played the insane &quot;Nora Desmond&quot; and Harvey Korman her servant Max. It then later continued as its own series of recurring sketches.
* The film has clearly influenced &quot;The Sixteen-Millimeter Shrine&quot;, which is the 1959 fourth episode of the first season of the original &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;. In it, Ida Lupino stars as Barbara Jean Trenton, an aging Hollywood film star who lives a secluded life in her mansion, reminiscing constantly about her past by watching her old films from the 1930s and planning an unrealistic comeback.
* The &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; episode &quot;Sepulveda Boulevard&quot; is a parody of the film, with various characters trying to steal screenplay ideas from each other; when characters try to justify the theft with, &quot;Hey, this is Hollywood,&quot; someone replies, &quot;This is the VALLEY, bub!&quot;
* In the episode of &quot;American Dad!&quot; entitled &quot;Star Trek&quot;, the plot revolves around the downfall of stardom and pays tribute by replicating the opening scene of the movie. The plot of the episode &quot;A Star is Reborn&quot; is also based on the film.
* The &quot;Archer&quot; season 7 finale and segue to the film noir &quot;Archer: Dreamland&quot; season 8 recreate the pool scene from the opening of the film.
* The Season 11 premiere of &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, entitled &quot;The Five-Foot Fence&quot;, begins with Larry David finding a home invader&#x27;s corpse floating face-down in his pool.
* The &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; character Gordon Cole is named after the &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; character. A scene from the film itself appears in Part 15 of &quot;Twin Peaks: The Return&quot;. In the scene, being viewed by Dale Cooper, the name &quot;Gordon Cole&quot; is spoken, which stirs Cooper&#x27;s buried memory of his time in the FBI.
* The &quot;3rd Rock from the Sun&quot; episode &quot;Fifteen Minutes of Dick&quot; (season 2, ep. 23) features a spoof on the film, wherein Sally, suddenly famous, spirals into Norma-esque despair as her celebrity wanes.
* The early episodes of &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; (2004) have numerous allusions to &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;, including the use of a dead person as a narrator, and another character&#x27;s fondness for Billy Wilder movies.
* In the movie &quot;Hick&quot;, Luli (Chloë Grace Moretz) can be found in her room reciting the movie in the mirror. Moretz stated that she was the one who suggested the quote be implemented.
* In the scene where Robin Williams first tries on his drag outfit in &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot;, he quotes Swanson&#x27;s famous line &quot;I&#x27;m ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille&quot;.

===Literature===

&quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; is frequently referenced in the book&quot; The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside The Room, the Greatest Bad Movie Ever Made&quot; by Greg Sestero and Tom Bissell, which documents Sestero&#x27;s relationship with director and actor Tommy Wiseau and the making of Wiseau&#x27;s film &quot;The Room&quot;. Quotes from &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; are used as epigraphs for several of the book&#x27;s chapters. In a 2017 interview, Sestero stated that &quot;I saw a lot of similarities with my story, especially when Tommy lived in a place that had a pool and wanted to make his own vanity project.&quot;

===Politics===
Donald Trump has cited the film as one of his personal favorites, and screened it multiple times at the White House Family Theater during his presidency. The press subsequently brought up an analogy between Trump&#x27;s Mar-a-Lago and Norma Desmond&#x27;s Sunset Boulevard mansion.

===Popular music===
The song &quot;Antarctica Starts Here&quot; by John Cale, from his 1973 album &quot;Paris 1919&quot;, describes a &quot;paranoid great movie queen&quot; that Cale said was inspired by the character of Norma Desmond.

The song &quot;Floating&quot; on the album &quot;Outskirts&quot; by Canadian country-rock band Blue Rodeo references the movie in its chorus line &#x27;I feel like William Holden floating in a pool.&#x27; The album&#x27;s liner notes explain the connection to the film.

The 1996 song &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; by the Spanish songwriter Javier Álvarez includes the verses (&quot;The paper years blind you again / as [they blinded] Norma Desmond in &#x27;Sunset Boulevard&#x27;&quot;.)

=== Professional wrestling ===
The &quot;Timeless&quot; gimmick, as portrayed by Australian wrestler Toni Storm in All Elite Wrestling in 2023 and 2024, is primarily based upon the character of Norma Desmond, with her &quot;butler&quot; – Canadian wrestler Dr. Luther – being based upon the character of Max von Mayerling. The storyline involving Storm also draws inspiration from the film &quot;All About Eve&quot;, with Storm&#x27;s character also sharing traits with the character of Margo Channing, and English wrestler Mariah May portraying an Eve Harrington-esque foil to Storm.

<doc id="76370" wikidata="Q46096" url="?curid=76370" title="Felix Mendelssohn">
<text>Jakob Ludwig Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy (3 February 18094 November 1847), widely known as Felix Mendelssohn, was a German composer, pianist, organist and conductor of the early Romantic period. Mendelssohn&#x27;s compositions include symphonies, concertos, piano music, organ music and chamber music. His best-known works include the overture and incidental music for &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (which includes his &quot;Wedding March&quot;), the &quot;Italian&quot; and &quot;Scottish&quot; Symphonies, the oratorios &quot;St. Paul&quot; and &quot;Elijah&quot;, the &quot;Hebrides&quot; Overture, the mature Violin Concerto, the String Octet, and the melody used in the Christmas carol &quot;Hark! The Herald Angels Sing&quot;. Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Songs Without Words&quot; are his most famous solo piano compositions.

Mendelssohn&#x27;s grandfather was the Jewish philosopher Moses Mendelssohn, but Felix was initially raised without religion until he was baptised aged seven into the Reformed Christian church. He was recognised early as a musical prodigy, but his parents were cautious and did not seek to capitalise on his talent. His sister Fanny Mendelssohn received a similar musical education and was a talented composer and pianist in her own right; some of her early songs were published under her brother&#x27;s name and her &quot;Easter Sonata&quot; was for a time mistakenly attributed to him after being lost and rediscovered in the 1970s.

Mendelssohn enjoyed early success in Germany, and revived interest in the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, notably with his performance of the &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot; in 1829. He became well received in his travels throughout Europe as a composer, conductor and soloist; his ten visits to Britain – during which many of his major works were premiered – form an important part of his adult career. His essentially conservative musical tastes set him apart from more adventurous musical contemporaries, such as Franz Liszt, Richard Wagner, Charles-Valentin Alkan and Hector Berlioz. The Leipzig Conservatory, which he founded, became a bastion of this anti-radical outlook. After a long period of relative denigration due to changing musical tastes and antisemitism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, his creative originality has been re-evaluated. He is now among the most popular composers of the Romantic era.

==Life==

===Childhood===
Felix Mendelssohn was born on 3 February 1809, in Hamburg, at the time an independent city-state, in the same house where, a year later, the dedicatee and first performer of his Violin Concerto, Ferdinand David, would be born. Mendelssohn&#x27;s father, the banker Abraham Mendelssohn, was the son of the German Jewish philosopher Moses Mendelssohn, whose family was prominent in the German Jewish community. Until his baptism at age seven, Mendelssohn was brought up largely without religion. His mother, Lea Salomon, was a member of the Itzig family and a sister of Jakob Salomon Bartholdy. Mendelssohn was the second of four children; his older sister Fanny also displayed exceptional and precocious musical talent.

The family moved to Berlin in 1811, leaving Hamburg in disguise in fear of French reprisal for the Mendelssohn bank&#x27;s role in breaking Napoleon&#x27;s Continental System blockade. Abraham and Lea Mendelssohn sought to give their children – Fanny, Felix, Paul and Rebecka – the best education possible. Fanny became a pianist well known in Berlin musical circles as a composer; originally Abraham had thought that she, rather than Felix, would be the more musical. But it was not considered proper, by either Abraham or Felix, for a woman to pursue a career in music, so she remained an active but non-professional musician. Abraham was initially disinclined to allow Felix to follow a musical career until it became clear that he was seriously dedicated.

Mendelssohn grew up in an intellectual environment. Frequent visitors to the salon organised by his parents at their home in Berlin included artists, musicians and scientists, among them Wilhelm and Alexander von Humboldt, and the mathematician Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet (whom Mendelssohn&#x27;s sister Rebecka would later marry). The musician Sarah Rothenburg has written of the household that &quot;Europe came to their living room&quot;.

===Surname===
Abraham Mendelssohn renounced the Jewish religion prior to Felix&#x27;s birth and he and his wife decided against having Felix circumcised. Felix and his siblings were at first brought up without religious education; on 21 March 1816, they were baptized in a private ceremony in the family&#x27;s Berlin apartment by the Reformed Protestant minister of the Jerusalem Church, at which time Felix was given the additional names Jakob Ludwig. Abraham and his wife Lea were baptised in 1822, and formally adopted the surname Mendelssohn Bartholdy (which they had used since 1812) for themselves and for their children.

The name Bartholdy was added at the suggestion of Lea&#x27;s brother, Jakob Salomon Bartholdy, who had inherited a property of this name in Luisenstadt and adopted it as his own surname. In an 1829 letter to Felix, Abraham explained that adopting the Bartholdy name was meant to demonstrate a decisive break with the traditions of his father Moses: &quot;There can no more be a Christian Mendelssohn than there can be a Jewish Confucius&quot;. (Letter to Felix of 8 July 1829). On embarking on his musical career, Felix did not entirely drop the name Mendelssohn as Abraham had requested, but in deference to his father signed his letters and had his visiting cards printed using the form &#x27;Mendelssohn Bartholdy&#x27;. In 1829, his sister Fanny wrote to him of &quot;Bartholdy [...] this name that we all dislike&quot;.

===Career===

====Musical education====
Mendelssohn began taking piano lessons from his mother when he was six, and at seven was tutored by Marie Bigot in Paris. Later in Berlin, all four Mendelssohn children studied piano with Ludwig Berger, who was himself a former student of Muzio Clementi. From at least May 1819 Mendelssohn (initially with his sister Fanny) studied counterpoint and composition with Carl Friedrich Zelter in Berlin. This was an important influence on his future career. Zelter had almost certainly been recommended as a teacher by his aunt Sarah Levy, who had been a pupil of W. F. Bach and a patron of C. P. E. Bach. Sarah Levy displayed some talent as a keyboard player, and often played with Zelter&#x27;s orchestra at the Berliner Singakademie; she and the Mendelssohn family were among its leading patrons. Sarah had formed an important collection of Bach family manuscripts, which she bequeathed to the Singakademie; Zelter, whose tastes in music were conservative, was also an admirer of the Bach tradition. This undoubtedly played a significant part in forming Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s musical tastes, as his works reflect this study of Baroque and early classical music. His fugues and chorales especially reflect a tonal clarity and use of counterpoint reminiscent of Johann Sebastian Bach, whose music influenced him deeply.

====Early maturity====
Mendelssohn probably made his first public concert appearance at the age of nine, when he participated in a chamber music concert accompanying a horn duo. He was a prolific composer from an early age. As an adolescent, his works were often performed at home with a private orchestra for the associates of his wealthy parents amongst the intellectual elite of Berlin. Between the ages of 12 and 14, Mendelssohn wrote 13 string symphonies for such concerts, and a number of chamber works. His first work, a piano quartet, was published when he was 13. It was probably Abraham Mendelssohn who procured the publication of this quartet by the house of Schlesinger. In 1824 the 15-year-old wrote his first symphony for full orchestra (in C minor, Op. 11).

At age 16 Mendelssohn wrote his String Octet in E-flat major, a work which has been regarded as &quot;mark[ing] the beginning of his maturity as a composer.&quot; This Octet and his Overture to Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, which he wrote a year later in 1826, are the best-known of his early works. (Later, in 1843, he also wrote incidental music for the play, including the famous &quot;Wedding March&quot;.) The Overture is perhaps the earliest example of a concert overture – that is, a piece not written deliberately to accompany a staged performance but to evoke a literary theme in performance on a concert platform; this was a genre which became a popular form in musical Romanticism.

In 1824 Mendelssohn studied under the composer and piano virtuoso Ignaz Moscheles, who confessed in his diaries that he had little to teach him. Moscheles and Mendelssohn became close colleagues and lifelong friends. The year 1827 saw the premiere – and sole performance in his lifetime – of Mendelssohn&#x27;s opera &quot;Die Hochzeit des Camacho&quot;. The failure of this production left him disinclined to venture into the genre again.

Besides music, Mendelssohn&#x27;s education included art, literature, languages, and philosophy. He had a particular interest in classical literature and translated Terence&#x27;s &quot;Andria&quot; for his tutor Heyse in 1825; Heyse was impressed and had it published in 1826 as a work of &quot;his pupil, F****&quot; [i.e. &quot;Felix&quot; (asterisks as provided in original text)]. This translation also qualified Mendelssohn to study at the University of Berlin, where from 1826 to 1829 he attended lectures on aesthetics by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, on history by Eduard Gans, and on geography by Carl Ritter.

====Meeting Goethe and conducting Bach====
In 1821 Zelter introduced Mendelssohn to his friend and correspondent, the writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (then in his seventies), who was greatly impressed by the child, leading to perhaps the earliest confirmed comparison with Mozart in the following conversation between Goethe and Zelter:

Mendelssohn was invited to meet Goethe on several later occasions, and set a number of Goethe&#x27;s poems to music. His other compositions inspired by Goethe include the overture &quot;Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage&quot; (Op. 27, 1828), and the cantata &quot;Die erste Walpurgisnacht&quot; (&quot;The First Walpurgis Night&quot;, Op. 60, 1832).

In 1829, with the backing of Zelter and the assistance of the actor Eduard Devrient, Mendelssohn arranged and conducted a performance in Berlin of Bach&#x27;s &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot;. Four years previously his grandmother, Bella Salomon, had given him a copy of the manuscript of this (by then all-but-forgotten) masterpiece. The orchestra and choir for the performance were provided by the Berlin Singakademie. The success of this performance, one of the very few since Bach&#x27;s death and the first ever outside of Leipzig, was the central event in the revival of Bach&#x27;s music in Germany and, eventually, throughout Europe. It earned Mendelssohn widespread acclaim at the age of 20. It also led to one of the few explicit references which Mendelssohn made to his origins: &quot;To think that it took an actor and a Jew&#x27;s son to revive the greatest Christian music for the world!&quot;

Over the next few years Mendelssohn travelled widely. His first visit to England was in 1829; other places visited during the 1830s included Vienna, Florence, Milan, Rome and Naples, in all of which he met with local and visiting musicians and artists. These years proved to be the germination for some of his most famous works, including the &quot;Hebrides Overture&quot; and the &quot;Scottish&quot; and &quot;Italian&quot; symphonies.

====Düsseldorf====
On Zelter&#x27;s death in 1832, Mendelssohn had hopes of succeeding him as conductor of the Singakademie; but at a vote in January 1833 he was defeated for the post by Carl Friedrich Rungenhagen. This may have been because of Mendelssohn&#x27;s youth, and fear of possible innovations; it was also suspected by some to be attributable to his Jewish ancestry. Following this rebuff, Mendelssohn divided most of his professional time over the next few years between Britain and Düsseldorf, where he was appointed musical director (his first paid post as a musician) in 1833.

In the spring of that year Mendelssohn directed the Lower Rhenish Music Festival in Düsseldorf, beginning with a performance of George Frideric Handel&#x27;s oratorio &quot;Israel in Egypt&quot; prepared from the original score, which he had found in London. This precipitated a Handel revival in Germany, similar to the reawakened interest in J. S. Bach following his performance of the &quot;St. Matthew Passion&quot;. Mendelssohn worked with the dramatist Karl Immermann to improve local theatre standards, and made his first appearance as an opera conductor in Immermann&#x27;s production of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; at the end of 1833, where he took umbrage at the audience&#x27;s protests about the cost of tickets. His frustration at his everyday duties in Düsseldorf, and the city&#x27;s provincialism, led him to resign his position at the end of 1834. He had offers from both Munich and Leipzig for important musical posts, namely, direction of the Munich Opera, the editorship of the prestigious Leipzig music journal the &quot;Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung&quot;, and direction of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra; he accepted the latter in 1835.

====Leipzig and Berlin====
In Leipzig, Mendelssohn concentrated on developing the town&#x27;s musical life by working with the orchestra, the opera house, the Thomanerchor (of which Bach had been a director), and the city&#x27;s other choral and musical institutions. Mendelssohn&#x27;s concerts included, in addition to many of his own works, three series of &quot;historical concerts&quot; featuring music of the eighteenth century, and a number of works by his contemporaries. He was deluged by offers of music from rising and would-be composers; among these was Richard Wagner, who submitted his early Symphony, the score of which, to Wagner&#x27;s disgust, Mendelssohn lost or mislaid. Mendelssohn also revived interest in the music of Franz Schubert. Robert Schumann discovered the manuscript of Schubert&#x27;s Ninth Symphony and sent it to Mendelssohn, who promptly premiered it in Leipzig on 21 March 1839, more than a decade after Schubert&#x27;s death.

A landmark event during Mendelssohn&#x27;s Leipzig years was the premiere of his oratorio &quot;Paulus&quot;, (the English version of this is known as &quot;St. Paul&quot;), given at the Lower Rhenish Festival in Düsseldorf in 1836, shortly after the death of the composer&#x27;s father, which affected him greatly; Felix wrote that he would &quot;never cease to endeavour to gain his approval ... although I can no longer enjoy it&quot;. &quot;St. Paul&quot; seemed to many of Mendelssohn&#x27;s contemporaries to be his finest work, and sealed his European reputation.

When Friedrich Wilhelm IV came to the Prussian throne in 1840 with ambitions to develop Berlin as a cultural centre (including the establishment of a music school, and reform of music for the church), the obvious choice to head these reforms was Mendelssohn. He was reluctant to undertake the task, especially in the light of his existing strong position in Leipzig. Mendelssohn nonetheless spent some time in Berlin, writing some church music such as &quot;Die Deutsche Liturgie&quot;, and, at the King&#x27;s request, music for productions of Sophocles&#x27;s &quot;Antigone&quot; (1841 – an overture and seven pieces) and &quot;Oedipus at Colonus&quot; (1845), &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1843) and Racine&#x27;s &quot;Athalie&quot; (1845). But the funds for the school never materialised, and many of the court&#x27;s promises to Mendelssohn regarding finances, title, and concert programming were broken. He was therefore not displeased to have the excuse to return to Leipzig.

In 1843 Mendelssohn founded a major music school – the Leipzig Conservatory, now the Hochschule für Musik und Theater &quot;Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy&quot;. where he persuaded Ignaz Moscheles and Robert Schumann to join him. Other prominent musicians, including the string players Ferdinand David and Joseph Joachim and the music theorist Moritz Hauptmann, also became staff members. After Mendelssohn&#x27;s death in 1847, his musically conservative tradition was carried on when Moscheles succeeded him as head of the Conservatory.

====Mendelssohn in Britain====
Mendelssohn first visited Britain in 1829, where Moscheles, who had already settled in London, introduced him to influential musical circles. In the summer he visited Edinburgh, where he met among others the composer John Thomson, whom he later recommended for the post of professor of music at Edinburgh University. He made ten visits to Britain, lasting altogether about 20 months; he won a strong following, which enabled him to make a good impression on British musical life. He composed and performed, and also edited for British publishers the first critical editions of oratorios of Handel and of the organ music of J. S. Bach. Scotland inspired two of his most famous works: the overture &quot;The Hebrides&quot; (also known as &quot;Fingal&#x27;s Cave&quot;); and the &quot;Scottish Symphony&quot; (Symphony No. 3). An English Heritage blue plaque commemorating Mendelssohn&#x27;s residence in London was placed at 4 Hobart Place in Belgravia, London, in 2013.

His protégé, the British composer and pianist William Sterndale Bennett, worked closely with Mendelssohn during this period, both in London and Leipzig. He first heard Bennett perform in London in 1833 aged 17. Bennett appeared with Mendelssohn in concerts in Leipzig throughout the 1836/1837 season.

On Mendelssohn&#x27;s eighth British visit in the summer of 1844, he conducted five of the Philharmonic concerts in London, and wrote: &quot;[N]ever before was anything like this season – we never went to bed before half-past one, every hour of every day was filled with engagements three weeks beforehand, and I got through more music in two months than in all the rest of the year.&quot; (Letter to Rebecka Mendelssohn Bartholdy, Soden, 22 July 1844). On subsequent visits Mendelssohn met Queen Victoria and her husband Prince Albert, himself a composer, who both greatly admired his music.

Mendelssohn&#x27;s oratorio &quot;Elijah&quot; was commissioned by the Birmingham Triennial Music Festival and premiered on 26 August 1846, at the Town Hall, Birmingham. It was composed to a German text translated into English by William Bartholomew, who authored and translated many of Mendelssohn&#x27;s works during his time in England.

On his last visit to Britain in 1847, Mendelssohn was the soloist in Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 4 and conducted his own &quot;Scottish Symphony&quot; with the Philharmonic Orchestra before the Queen and Prince Albert.

====Death====
Mendelssohn suffered from poor health in the final years of his life, probably aggravated by nervous problems and overwork. A final tour of England left him exhausted and ill, and the death of his sister, Fanny, on 14 May 1847, caused him further distress. Less than six months later, on 4 November, aged 38, Mendelssohn died in Leipzig after a series of strokes. His grandfather Moses, Fanny, and both his parents had all died from similar apoplexies. Although he had been generally meticulous in the management of his affairs, he died intestate.

Mendelssohn&#x27;s funeral was held at the Paulinerkirche, Leipzig, and he was buried at the Dreifaltigkeitsfriedhof I in Berlin-Kreuzberg. The pallbearers included Moscheles, Schumann and Niels Gade. Mendelssohn had once described death, in a letter to a stranger, as a place &quot;where it is to be hoped there is still music, but no more sorrow or partings.&quot;

==Personal life==

====Personality====
While Mendelssohn was often presented as equable, happy, and placid in temperament, particularly in the detailed family memoirs published by his nephew Sebastian Hensel after the composer&#x27;s death, this was misleading. The music historian R. Larry Todd notes &quot;the remarkable process of idealization&quot; of Mendelssohn&#x27;s character &quot;that crystallized in the memoirs of the composer&#x27;s circle&quot;, including Hensel&#x27;s. The nickname &quot;discontented Polish count&quot; was given to Mendelssohn on account of his aloofness, and he referred to the epithet in his letters. He was frequently given to fits of temper which occasionally led to collapse. Devrient mentions that on one occasion in the 1830s, when his wishes had been crossed, &quot;his excitement was increased so fearfully ... that when the family was assembled ... he began to talk incoherently in English. The stern voice of his father at last checked the wild torrent of words; they took him to bed, and a profound sleep of twelve hours restored him to his normal state&quot;. Such fits may be related to his early death.

Mendelssohn was an enthusiastic visual artist who worked in pencil and watercolour, a skill which he enjoyed throughout his life. His correspondence indicates that he could write with considerable wit in German and English – his letters were sometimes accompanied by humorous sketches and cartoons.

====Religion====
On 21 March 1816, at the age of seven years, Mendelssohn was baptised with his brother and sisters in a private domestic ceremony by Johann Jakob Stegemann, Minister of the Evangelical congregation of Berlin&#x27;s Jerusalem Church and New Church. Although Mendelssohn was a conforming Christian as a member of the Reformed Church, he was both conscious and proud of his Jewish ancestry and notably of his connection with his grandfather, Moses Mendelssohn. He was the prime mover in proposing to the publisher Heinrich Brockhaus a complete edition of Moses&#x27; works, which continued with the support of his uncle, Joseph Mendelssohn. Felix was notably reluctant, either in his letters or conversation, to comment on his innermost beliefs; his friend Devrient wrote that &quot;[his] deep convictions were never uttered in intercourse with the world; only in rare and intimate moments did they ever appear, and then only in the slightest and most humorous allusions&quot;. Thus for example in a letter to his sister Rebecka, Mendelssohn rebukes her complaint about an unpleasant relative: &quot;What do you mean by saying you are not hostile to Jews? I hope this was a joke [...] It is really sweet of you that you do not despise your family, isn&#x27;t it?&quot; Some modern scholars have devoted considerable energy to demonstrate either that Mendelssohn was deeply sympathetic to his ancestors&#x27; Jewish beliefs, or that he was hostile to this and sincere in his Christian beliefs.

====Mendelssohn and his contemporaries====
 Throughout his life Mendelssohn was wary of the more radical musical developments undertaken by some of his contemporaries. He was generally on friendly, if sometimes somewhat cool, terms with Hector Berlioz, Franz Liszt, and Giacomo Meyerbeer, but in his letters expresses his frank disapproval of their works, for example writing of Liszt that his compositions were &quot;inferior to his playing, and […] only calculated for virtuosos&quot;; of Berlioz&#x27;s overture &quot;Les francs-juges&quot; &quot;[T]he orchestration is such a frightful muddle [...] that one ought to wash one&#x27;s hands after handling one of his scores&quot;; and of Meyerbeer&#x27;s opera &quot;Robert le diable&quot; &quot;I consider it ignoble&quot;, calling its villain Bertram &quot;a poor devil&quot;. When his friend the composer Ferdinand Hiller suggested in conversation to Mendelssohn that he looked rather like Meyerbeer – they were actually distant cousins, both descendants of Rabbi Moses Isserles – Mendelssohn was so upset that he immediately went to get a haircut to differentiate himself.

In particular, Mendelssohn seems to have regarded Paris and its music with the greatest of suspicion and an almost puritanical distaste. Attempts made during his visit there to interest him in Saint-Simonianism ended in embarrassing scenes. It is significant that the only musician with whom Mendelssohn remained a close personal friend, Ignaz Moscheles, was of an older generation and equally conservative in outlook. Moscheles preserved this conservative attitude at the Leipzig Conservatory until his own death in 1870.

====Marriage and children====
 Mendelssohn married Cécile Charlotte Sophie Jeanrenaud (10 October 1817 – 25 September 1853), the daughter of a French Reformed Church clergyman, on 28 March 1837. The couple had five children: Carl, Marie, Paul, Lili and Felix August. The second youngest child, Felix August, contracted measles in 1844 and was left with impaired health; he died in 1851. The eldest, Carl Mendelssohn Bartholdy (7 February 1838 – 23 February 1897), became a historian, and professor of history at Heidelberg and Freiburg universities; he died in a psychiatric institution in Freiburg aged 59. Paul Mendelssohn Bartholdy (1841–1880) was a noted chemist and pioneered the manufacture of aniline dye. Marie married Victor Benecke and lived in London. Lili married Adolf Wach, later professor of law at Leipzig University.

The family papers inherited by Marie&#x27;s and Lili&#x27;s children form the basis of the extensive collection of Mendelssohn manuscripts, including the so-called &quot;Green Books&quot; of his correspondence, now in the Bodleian Library at Oxford University. Cécile Mendelssohn Bartholdy died less than six years after her husband, on 25 September 1853.

====Jenny Lind====
Mendelssohn became close to the Swedish soprano Jenny Lind, whom he met in October 1844. Papers confirming their relationship had not been made public. In 2013, George Biddlecombe confirmed in the &quot;Journal of the Royal Musical Association&quot; that &quot;The Committee of the Mendelssohn Scholarship Foundation possesses material indicating that Mendelssohn wrote passionate love letters to Jenny Lind entreating her to join him in an adulterous relationship and threatening suicide as a means of exerting pressure upon her, and that these letters were destroyed on being discovered after her death.&quot;

Mendelssohn met and worked with Lind many times, and started an opera, &quot;Lorelei&quot;, for her, based on the legend of the Lorelei Rhine maidens; the opera was unfinished at his death. He is said to have tailored the aria &quot;Hear Ye Israel&quot;, in his oratorio &quot;Elijah&quot;, to Lind&#x27;s voice, although she did not sing the part until after his death, at a concert in December 1848. In 1847, Mendelssohn attended a London performance of Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;Robert le diable&quot; – an opera that musically he despised – in order to hear Lind&#x27;s British debut, in the role of Alice. The music critic Henry Chorley, who was with him, wrote: &quot;I see as I write the smile with which Mendelssohn, whose enjoyment of Mdlle. Lind&#x27;s talent was unlimited, turned round and looked at me, as if a load of anxiety had been taken off his mind. His attachment to Mdlle. Lind&#x27;s genius as a singer was unbounded, as was his desire for her success.&quot;

Upon Mendelssohn&#x27;s death, Lind wrote: &quot;[He was] the only person who brought fulfillment to my spirit, and almost as soon as I found him I lost him again.&quot; In 1849, she established the Mendelssohn Scholarship Foundation, which makes an award to a young resident British composer every two years in Mendelssohn&#x27;s memory. The first winner of the scholarship, in 1856, was Arthur Sullivan, then aged 14. In 1869, Lind erected a plaque in Mendelssohn&#x27;s memory at his birthplace in Hamburg.

==Music==
===Composer===
====Style====
 Something of Mendelssohn&#x27;s intense attachment to his personal vision of music is conveyed in his comments to a correspondent who suggested converting some of the &quot;Songs Without Words&quot; into lieder by adding texts: &quot;What [the] music I love expresses to me, are not thoughts that are too &quot;indefinite&quot; for me to put into words, but on the contrary, too &quot;definite&quot;.&quot;

Schumann wrote of Mendelssohn that he was &quot;the Mozart of the nineteenth century, the most brilliant musician, the one who most clearly sees through the contradictions of the age and for the first time reconciles them.&quot; This appreciation brings to the fore two features that characterized Mendelssohn&#x27;s compositions and his compositional process. First, that his inspiration for musical style was rooted in his technical mastery and his interpretation of the style of previous masters, although he certainly recognized and developed the strains of early Romanticism in the music of Beethoven and Weber. The historian James Garratt writes that from his early career, &quot;the view emerged that Mendelssohn&#x27;s engagement with early music was a defining aspect of his creativity.&quot; This approach was recognized by Mendelssohn himself, who wrote that, in his meetings with Goethe, he gave the poet &quot;historical exhibitions&quot; at the keyboard; &quot;every morning, for about an hour, I have to play a variety of works by great composers in chronological order, and must explain to him how they contributed to the advance of music.&quot; Secondly, it highlights that Mendelssohn was more concerned to reinvigorate the musical legacy which he inherited, rather than to replace it with new forms and styles, or with the use of more exotic orchestration. In these ways he differed significantly from many of his contemporaries in the early Romantic period, such as Wagner, Berlioz and Franz Liszt. Whilst Mendelssohn admired Liszt&#x27;s virtuosity at the keyboard, he found his music jejune. Berlioz said of Mendelssohn that he had &quot;perhaps studied the music of the dead too closely.&quot;

The musicologist Greg Vitercik considers that, while &quot;Mendelssohn&#x27;s music only rarely aspires to provoke&quot;, the stylistic innovations evident from his earliest works solve some of the contradictions between classical forms and the sentiments of Romanticism. The expressiveness of Romantic music presented a problem in adherence to sonata form; the final (recapitulation) section of a movement could seem, in the context of Romantic style, a bland element without passion or soul. Furthermore, it could be seen as a pedantic delay before reaching the emotional climax of a movement, which in the classical tradition had tended to be at the transition from the development section of the movement to the recapitulation; whereas Berlioz and other &quot;modernists&quot; sought to have the emotional climax at the end of a movement, if necessary by adding an extended coda to follow the recapitulation proper. Mendelssohn&#x27;s solution to this problem was less sensational than Berlioz&#x27;s approach, but was rooted in changing the structural balance of the formal components of the movement. Thus typically in a Mendelssohnian movement, the development-recapitulation transition might not be strongly marked, and the recapitulation section would be harmonically or melodically varied so as not to be a direct copy of the opening, exposition, section; this allowed a logical movement towards a final climax. Vitercik summarizes the effect as &quot;to assimilate the dynamic trajectory of &#x27;external form&#x27; to the &#x27;logical&#x27; unfolding of the story of the theme&quot;.

Richard Taruskin wrote that, although Mendelssohn produced works of extraordinary mastery at a very early age,
he never outgrew his precocious youthful style. [...] He remained stylistically conservative [...] feeling no need to attract attention with a display of &quot;revolutionary&quot; novelty. Throughout his short career he remained comfortably faithful to the musical status quo – that is, the &quot;classical&quot; forms, as they were already thought of by his time. His version of romanticism, already evident in his earliest works, consisted in musical &quot;pictorialism&quot; of a fairly conventional, objective nature (though exquisitely wrought).

====Early works====
The young Mendelssohn was greatly influenced in his childhood by the music of both J. S. Bach and C. P. E. Bach, and of Beethoven, Joseph Haydn and Mozart; traces of these composers can be seen in the 13 early string symphonies. These were written from 1821 to 1823, when he was between the ages of 12 and 14, principally for performance in the Mendelssohn household, and not published or publicly performed until long after his death.

His first published works were his three piano quartets (1822–1825; Op. 1 in C minor, Op. 2 in F minor and Op. 3 in B minor); but his capacities are especially revealed in a group of works of his early maturity: the String Octet (1825), the Overture &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1826), which in its finished form also owes much to the influence of Adolf Bernhard Marx, at the time a close friend of Mendelssohn, and the two early string quartets: Op. 12 (1829) and Op. 13 (1827), which both show a remarkable grasp of the techniques and ideas of Beethoven&#x27;s last quartets that Mendelssohn had been closely studying. These four works show an intuitive command of form, harmony, counterpoint, colour, and compositional technique, which in the opinion of R. Larry Todd justifies claims frequently made that Mendelssohn&#x27;s precocity exceeded even that of Mozart in its intellectual grasp.

A 2009 survey by the BBC of 16 music critics opined that Mendelssohn was the greatest composing prodigy in the history of Western classical music.

====Symphonies====

Mendelssohn&#x27;s mature symphonies are numbered approximately in the order of publication, rather than the order in which they were composed. The order of composition is: 1, 5, 4, 2, 3. The placement of No. 3 in this sequence is problematic because he worked on it for over a decade, starting the sketches soon after he began work on No. 5 but completing it after both Nos. 5 and 4.

The Symphony No. 1 in C minor for full orchestra was written in 1824, when Mendelssohn was aged 15. This work is experimental, showing the influences of Beethoven and Carl Maria von Weber. Mendelssohn conducted the symphony on his first visit to London in 1829, with the orchestra of the Philharmonic Society. For the third movement he substituted an orchestration of the Scherzo from his Octet. In this form the piece was a success, and laid the foundations of his British reputation.

During 1829 and 1830 Mendelssohn wrote his Symphony No. 5, known as the &quot;Reformation&quot;. It celebrated the 300th anniversary of the Reformation. Mendelssohn remained dissatisfied with the work and did not allow publication of the score.

Mendelssohn&#x27;s travels in Italy inspired him to compose the Symphony No. 4 in A major, known as the &quot;Italian Symphony&quot;. He conducted the premiere in 1833, but did not allow the score to be published during his lifetime, as he continually sought to rewrite it.

The &quot;Scottish Symphony&quot; (Symphony No. 3 in A minor) was written and revised intermittently between 1829 (when Mendelssohn noted down the opening theme during a visit to Holyrood Palace) and 1842, when it was given its premiere in Leipzig, the last of his symphonies to be premiered in public. This piece evokes Scotland&#x27;s atmosphere in the ethos of Romanticism, but does not employ any identified Scottish folk melodies.

He wrote the symphony-cantata &quot;Lobgesang&quot; (&quot;Hymn of Praise&quot;) in B-flat major, posthumously named Symphony No. 2, to mark the celebrations in Leipzig of the supposed 400th anniversary of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg; the first performance took place on 25 June 1840.

====Other orchestral music====

Mendelssohn wrote the concert overture &quot;The Hebrides&quot; (&quot;Fingal&#x27;s Cave&quot;) in 1830, inspired by visits to Scotland around the end of the 1820s. He visited Fingal&#x27;s Cave, on the Hebridean isle of Staffa, as part of his Grand Tour of Europe, and was so impressed that he scribbled the opening theme of the overture on the spot, including it in a letter he wrote home the same evening. He wrote other concert overtures, notably &quot;Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage&quot; (&quot;Meeresstille und glückliche Fahrt&quot;, 1828), inspired by a pair of poems by Goethe and &quot;The Fair Melusine (Die schöne Melusine)&quot; (1830). A contemporary writer considered these works as &quot;perhaps the most beautiful overtures that, so far, we Germans possess&quot;.

Mendelssohn also wrote in 1839 an overture to &quot;Ruy Blas&quot;, commissioned for a charity performance of Victor Hugo&#x27;s drama (which the composer hated). His incidental music to &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (Op. 61), including the well-known &quot;Wedding March&quot;, was written in 1843, seventeen years after the Overture.

====Concertos====
The Violin Concerto in E minor, Op. 64 (1844), was written for Ferdinand David. David, who had worked closely with Mendelssohn during the piece&#x27;s preparation, gave the premiere of the concerto on his Guarneri violin. Joseph Joachim called it one of the four great violin concertos along with those of Beethoven, Brahms, and Bruch.

Mendelssohn also wrote a lesser-known, early concerto for violin and strings in D minor (1822); four piano concertos (&quot;no. 0&quot; in A minor, 1822; 1 in G minor, 1831; 2 in D minor, 1837; and 3 in E minor, a posthumously published fragment from 1844); two concertos for two pianos and orchestra (E major, which he wrote at 14 [1823], and A-flat major, at 15 [1824]); and another double concerto, for violin and piano (1823). In addition, there are several single-movement works for soloist and orchestra. Those for piano are the &quot;Rondo Brillante&quot; of 1834, the &quot;Capriccio Brillante&quot; of 1832, and the &quot;Serenade and Allegro Giocoso&quot; of 1838. He also wrote two concertinos (&quot;Konzertstücke&quot;), Op. 113 and 114, originally for clarinet, basset horn and piano; Op. 113 was orchestrated by the composer.

====Chamber music====
Mendelssohn&#x27;s mature output contains numerous chamber works, many of which display an emotional intensity lacking in some of his larger works. In particular, his String Quartet No. 6, the last of his string quartets and his last major work – written following the death of his sister Fanny – is, in the opinion of the historian Peter Mercer-Taylor, exceptionally powerful and eloquent. Other mature works include two string quintets; sonatas for the clarinet, cello, viola and violin; and two piano trios. For the Piano Trio No. 1 in D minor, Mendelssohn uncharacteristically took the advice of his fellow composer, Ferdinand Hiller, and rewrote the piano part in a more Romantic, &quot;Schumannesque&quot; style, considerably heightening its effect.

====Piano music====

The musicologist Glenn Stanley observes that &quot;[u]nlike Brahms, unlike his contemporaries Schumann, Chopin and Liszt, and unlike [his] revered past masters...Mendelssohn did not regard the piano as a preferred medium for his most significant artistic statements&quot;. Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Songs Without Words&quot; (&quot;Lieder ohne Worte&quot;), eight cycles each containing six lyric pieces (two published posthumously), remain his most famous solo piano compositions. They became standard parlour recital items even during the composer&#x27;s lifetime, and their overwhelming popularity, according to Todd, has itself caused many critics to underrate their musical value. As example, Charles Rosen equivocally commented, despite noting &quot;how much beautiful music they contain&quot;, that &quot;[i]t is not true that they are insipid, but they might as well be.&quot; During the 19th century, composers who were inspired to produce similar pieces of their own included Charles-Valentin Alkan (his five sets of &quot;Chants&quot;, each ending with a barcarolle) and Anton Rubinstein.

Other notable piano works by Mendelssohn include his &quot;Variations sérieuses&quot;, Op. 54 (1841), the &quot;Rondo Capriccioso&quot;, the set of six &quot;Preludes and Fugues&quot;, Op. 35 (written between 1832 and 1837), and the &quot;Seven Characteristic Pieces&quot;, Op. 7 (1827).

====Organ music====
Mendelssohn played and composed for organ from the age of 11 until his death. His primary organ works are the &quot;Three Preludes and Fugues&quot;, Op. 37 (1837), and the &quot;Six Sonatas&quot;, Op. 65 (1845), of which Eric Werner wrote &quot;next to Bach&#x27;s works, Mendelssohn&#x27;s Organ Sonatas belong to the required repertory of all organists&quot;.

====Opera====
Mendelssohn wrote some Singspiele for family performance in his youth. His opera &quot;Die beiden Neffen&quot; (&quot;The Two Nephews&quot;) was rehearsed for him on his 15th birthday. 1829 saw &quot;Die Heimkehr aus der Fremde&quot; (&quot;Son and Stranger&quot; or &quot;Return of the Roamer&quot;), a comedy of mistaken identity written in honour of his parents&#x27; silver anniversary and unpublished during his lifetime. In 1825 he wrote a more sophisticated work, &quot;Die Hochzeit des Camacho&quot; (&quot;Camacho&#x27;s Wedding&quot;), based on an episode in &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, for public consumption. It was produced in Berlin in 1827, but coolly received. Mendelssohn left the theatre before the conclusion of the first performance, and subsequent performances were cancelled.

Although he never abandoned the idea of composing a full opera, and considered many subjects – including that of the Nibelung saga later adapted by Wagner, about which he corresponded with his sister Fanny – he never wrote more than a few pages of sketches for any project. In Mendelssohn&#x27;s last years the opera manager Benjamin Lumley tried to contract him to write an opera from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot; on a libretto by Eugène Scribe, and even announced it as forthcoming in 1847, the year of Mendelssohn&#x27;s death. The libretto was eventually set by Fromental Halévy. At his death Mendelssohn left some sketches for an opera on the story of the Lorelei.

====Choral works====
Mendelssohn&#x27;s two large biblical oratorios, &quot;St Paul&quot; in 1836 and &quot;Elijah&quot; in 1846, are greatly influenced by J. S. Bach. The surviving fragments of an unfinished oratorio, &quot;Christus&quot;, consist of a recitative, a chorus &quot;There Shall a Star Come out of Jacob&quot;, and a male voice trio.

Strikingly different is the more overtly Romantic &quot;Die erste Walpurgisnacht&quot; (&quot;The First Walpurgis Night&quot;), a setting for chorus and orchestra of a ballad by Goethe describing pagan rituals of the Druids in the Harz mountains in the early days of Christianity. This score has been seen by the scholar Heinz-Klaus Metzger as a &quot;Jewish protest against the domination of Christianity&quot;.

Mendelssohn wrote five settings from &quot;The Book of Psalms&quot; for chorus and orchestra. Schumann opined in 1837 that his version of Psalm 42 was the &quot;highest point that he [Mendelssohn] reached as a composer for the church. Indeed the highest point recent church music has reached at all.&quot;

Mendelssohn also wrote many smaller-scale sacred works for unaccompanied choir, such as a setting of Psalm 100, &quot;Jauchzet dem Herrn, alle Welt&quot;, and for choir with organ. Most are written in or translated into English. Among the most famous is &quot;Hear My Prayer&quot;, whose second half contains &quot;O for the Wings of a Dove&quot;, which became often performed as a separate item. The piece is written for full choir, organ, and a treble or soprano soloist. Mendelssohn&#x27;s biographer Todd comments, &quot;The very popularity of the anthem in England [...] later exposed it to charges of superficiality from those contemptuous of Victorian mores.&quot;

A hymn tune &quot;Mendelssohn&quot; – an adaptation by William Hayman Cummings of a melody from Mendelssohn&#x27;s cantata &quot;Festgesang&quot; (&quot;Festive Hymn&quot;), a secular 1840s composition, which Mendelssohn felt unsuited to sacred music – has become the standard tune for Charles Wesley&#x27;s popular Christmas hymn &quot;Hark! The Herald Angels Sing&quot;.

====Songs====
Mendelssohn wrote many songs, both for solo voice and for duet, with piano. It has been asserted that from 1819 (when he was 10) until his death there was &quot;scarcely a single month in which he was not occupied with song composition&quot;. Many of these songs are simple, or slightly modified, strophic settings. Some, such as his best-known song &quot;Auf Flügeln des Gesanges&quot; (&quot;On Wings of Song&quot;), became popular. The scholar Susan Youens comments &quot;If [Mendelssohn]&#x27;s emotional range in lied was narrower than Schubert&#x27;s, that is hardly surprising: Schubert composed many more songs than Mendelssohn across a wider spectrum&quot;, and whilst Schubert had a declared intent to modernize the song style of his day, &quot;[t]his was not Mendelssohn&#x27;s mission.&quot;

A number of songs written by Mendelssohn&#x27;s sister Fanny originally appeared under her brother&#x27;s name; this may have been partly due to the prejudice of the family, and partly to her own retiring nature. In 1842, this resulted in an embarrassing moment when Queen Victoria, receiving Felix at Buckingham Palace, expressed her intention of singing to the composer her favourite of his songs, &quot;Italien&quot; (to words by Franz Grillparzer), which Felix confessed was by Fanny.

===Performer===
During his lifetime, Mendelssohn became renowned as a keyboard performer, both on the piano and organ. One of his obituarists noted: &quot;First and chiefest we esteem his pianoforte-playing, with its amazing elasticity of touch, rapidity, and power; next his scientific and vigorous organ playing [...] his triumphs on these instruments are fresh in public recollection. In his concerts and recitals Mendelssohn performed works by some of his German predecessors, notably Carl Maria von Weber, Beethoven and J.S. Bach, whose organ music he brought back into the repertoire &quot;virtually alone&quot;.

Mendelssohn admired the grand pianos of the Viennese maker Conrad Graf; he acquired one in 1832 which he used in the family house and recitals in Berlin, and later another for use in Düsseldorf. In private and public performances, Mendelssohn was celebrated for his improvisations. On one occasion in London, when asked by the soprano Maria Malibran after a recital to extemporise, he improvised a piece which included the melodies of all the songs she had sung. The music publisher Victor Novello, who was present, remarked &quot;He has done some things that seem to me impossible, even after I have heard them done.&quot; At another recital in 1837, where Mendelssohn played the piano for a singer, Robert Schumann ignored the soprano and wrote &quot;Mendelssohn accompanied like a God.&quot;

===Conductor===
Mendelssohn was a noted conductor, both of his own works and of those by other composers. At his London debut in 1829, he was noted for his innovatory use of a baton (then a great novelty). But his novelty also extended to taking great care over tempo, dynamics and the orchestral players themselves – both rebuking them when they were recalcitrant and praising them when they satisfied him. It was his success while conducting at the Lower Rhine music festival of 1836 that led to him taking his first paid professional position as director at Düsseldorf. Among those appreciating Mendelssohn&#x27;s conducting was Hector Berlioz, who in 1843, invited to Leipzig, exchanged batons with Mendelssohn, writing &quot;When the Great Spirit sends us to hunt in the land of souls, may our warriors hang our tomahawks side by side at the door of the council chamber&quot;. At Leipzig, Mendelssohn led the Gewandhaus Orchestra to great heights; although concentrating on the great composers of the past (already becoming canonised as the &quot;classics&quot;) he also included new music by Schumann, Berlioz, Gade and many others, as well as his own music. One critic who was not impressed was Richard Wagner; he accused Mendelssohn of using tempos in his performances of Beethoven symphonies that were far too fast.

===Editor===
Mendelssohn&#x27;s interest in baroque music was not limited to the Bach &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot; which he had revived in 1829. He was concerned in preparing and editing such music, whether for performance or for publication, to be as close as possible to the original intentions of the composers, including wherever possible a close study of early editions and manuscripts. This could lead him into conflict with publishers; for instance, his edition of Handel&#x27;s oratorio &quot;Israel in Egypt&quot; for the London Handel Society (1845) evoked an often contentious correspondence, with Mendelssohn refusing for example to add dynamics where not given by Handel, or to add parts for trombones. Mendelssohn also edited a number of Bach&#x27;s works for organ, and apparently discussed with Robert Schumann the possibility of producing a complete Bach edition.

===Teacher===
Although Mendelssohn attributed great importance to musical education, and made a substantial commitment to the Conservatoire he founded in Leipzig, he did not greatly enjoy teaching and took only a very few private pupils who he believed had notable qualities. Such students included the composer William Sterndale Bennett, the pianist Camille-Marie Stamaty, the violinist and composer Julius Eichberg, and Walther von Goethe (grandson of the poet). At the Leipzig Conservatoire Mendelssohn taught classes in composition and ensemble playing.

==Reputation and legacy==

===The first century===

In the immediate wake of Mendelssohn&#x27;s death, he was mourned both in Germany and England. However, the conservative strain in Mendelssohn, which set him apart from some of his more flamboyant contemporaries, bred a corollary condescension amongst some of them toward his music. Mendelssohn&#x27;s relations with Berlioz, Liszt and others had been uneasy and equivocal. Listeners who had raised questions about Mendelssohn&#x27;s talent included Heinrich Heine, who wrote in 1836 after hearing the oratorio &quot;St. Paul&quot; that his work was

characterized by a great, strict, very serious seriousness, a determined, almost importunate tendency to follow classical models, the finest, cleverest calculation, sharp intelligence and, finally, complete lack of naïveté. But is there in art any originality of genius without naïveté?

Such criticism of Mendelssohn for his very ability – which could be characterised negatively as facility – was taken to further lengths by Richard Wagner. Mendelssohn&#x27;s success, his popularity and his Jewish origins irked Wagner sufficiently to damn Mendelssohn with faint praise, three years after his death, in an anti-Jewish pamphlet &quot;Das Judenthum in der Musik&quot;:

[Mendelssohn] has shown us that a Jew may have the amplest store of specific talents, may own the finest and most varied culture, the highest and tenderest sense of honour – yet without all these pre-eminences helping him, were it but one single time, to call forth in us that deep, that heart-searching effect which we await from art [...] The washiness and the whimsicality of our present musical style has been [...] pushed to its utmost pitch by Mendelssohn&#x27;s endeavour to speak out a vague, an almost nugatory Content as interestingly and spiritedly as possible.

The philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche expressed consistent admiration for Mendelssohn&#x27;s music, in contrast to his general scorn for &quot;Teutonic&quot; Romanticism:

At any rate, the whole music of romanticism [e.g. Schumann and Wagner] ... was second-rate music from the very start, and real musicians took little notice of it. Things were different with Felix Mendelssohn, that halcyon master who, thanks to his easier, purer, happier soul, was quickly honoured and just as quickly forgotten, as a lovely &quot;incident&quot; in German music.

Some readers, however, have interpreted Nietzsche&#x27;s characterization of Mendelssohn as a &#x27;lovely incident&#x27; as condescending.

In the 20th century the Nazi regime and its &quot;Reichsmusikkammer&quot; cited Mendelssohn&#x27;s Jewish origin in banning performance and publication of his works, even asking Nazi-approved composers to rewrite incidental music for &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (Carl Orff obliged). Under the Nazis, &quot;Mendelssohn was presented as a dangerous &#x27;accident&#x27; of music history, who played a decisive role in rendering German music in the 19th century &#x27;degenerate&#x27;.&quot; The German Mendelssohn Scholarship for students at the Leipzig Conservatoire was discontinued in 1934 (and not revived until 1963). The monument dedicated to Mendelssohn erected in Leipzig in 1892 was removed by the Nazis in 1936. A replacement was erected in 2008. The bronze statue of Mendelssohn by Clemens Buscher outside the Düsseldorf Opera House was also removed and destroyed by the Nazis in 1936. A replacement was erected in 2012. Mendelssohn&#x27;s grave remained unmolested during the Nazi years.

Mendelssohn&#x27;s reputation in Britain remained high throughout the 19th century. Prince Albert inscribed (in German) a libretto for the oratorio &quot;Elijah&quot; in 1847: &quot;To the noble artist who, surrounded by the Baal-worship of false art, has been able, like a second Elijah, through genius and study, to remain true to the service of true art.&quot; In 1851 an adulatory novel by the teenaged Elizabeth Sara Sheppard was published, &quot;Charles Auchester&quot;. The book features as its leading character the &quot;Chevalier Seraphel&quot;, an idealized portrait of Mendelssohn, and remained in print for nearly 80 years. In 1854 Queen Victoria requested that the Crystal Palace include a statue of Mendelssohn when it was rebuilt. Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Wedding March&quot; from &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; was played at the wedding of Queen Victoria&#x27;s daughter, Princess Victoria, The Princess Royal, to Crown Prince Frederick William of Prussia in 1858, and it remains popular at marriage ceremonies. Mendelssohn&#x27;s pupil Sterndale Bennett was a major force in British musical education until his death in 1875, and a great upholder of his master&#x27;s traditions; he numbered among his pupils many of the next generation of English composers, including Sullivan, Hubert Parry and Francis Edward Bache.

By the early twentieth century, many critics, including Bernard Shaw, began to condemn Mendelssohn&#x27;s music for its association with Victorian cultural insularity; Shaw in particular complained of the composer&#x27;s &quot; gentility, his conventional sentimentality, and his despicable oratorio-mongering&quot;. In the 1950s the scholar Wilfrid Mellers complained of Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;spurious religiosity which reflected the element of unconscious humbug in our morality&quot;. A contrasting opinion came from the pianist and composer Ferruccio Busoni, who considered Mendelssohn &quot;a master of undisputed greatness&quot; and &quot;an heir of Mozart&quot;. Busoni, like earlier virtuosi such as Anton Rubinstein and Charles-Valentin Alkan, regularly included Mendelssohn&#x27;s piano works in his recitals.

===Modern opinions===

Appreciation of Mendelssohn&#x27;s work has developed since the mid-20th century, together with the publication of a number of biographies placing his achievements in context. Mercer-Taylor comments on the irony that &quot;this broad-based reevaluation of Mendelssohn&#x27;s music is made possible, in part, by a general disintegration of the idea of a musical canon&quot;, an idea which Mendelssohn &quot;as a conductor, pianist and scholar&quot; had done so much to establish. The critic H. L. Mencken concluded that, if Mendelssohn indeed missed true greatness, he missed it &quot;by a hair&quot;.

Charles Rosen, in a chapter on Mendelssohn in his 1995 book &quot;The Romantic Generation&quot;, both praised and criticized the composer. He called him &quot;the greatest child prodigy the history of Western music has ever known&quot;, whose command at age 16 surpassed that of Mozart or Chopin at 19, the possessor at an early age of a &quot;control of large-scale structure unsurpassed by any composer of his generation&quot;, and a &quot;genius&quot; with a &quot;profound&quot; comprehension of Beethoven. Rosen believed that in the composer&#x27;s later years, without losing his craft or genius, he &quot;renounced ... his daring&quot;; but he called Mendelssohn&#x27;s relatively late Violin Concerto in E minor &quot;the most successful synthesis of the Classical concerto tradition and the Romantic virtuoso form&quot;. Rosen considered the &quot;Fugue in E minor&quot; (later included in Mendelssohn&#x27;s Op. 35 for piano) a &quot;masterpiece&quot;; but in the same paragraph called Mendelssohn &quot;the inventor of religious kitsch in music&quot;. Nevertheless, he pointed out how the dramatic power of &quot;the juncture of religion and music&quot; in Mendelssohn&#x27;s oratorios is reflected throughout the music of the next fifty years in the operas of Meyerbeer and Giuseppe Verdi and in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Parsifal&quot;.

A large portion of Mendelssohn&#x27;s 750 works still remained unpublished in the 1960s, but most of them are now available. A scholarly edition of Mendelssohn&#x27;s complete works and correspondence is in preparation but is expected to take many years to complete, and will be in excess of 150 volumes. This includes a modern and fully researched catalogue of his works, the Mendelssohn-Werkverzeichnis (MWV). Mendelssohn&#x27;s oeuvre has been explored more deeply. Recordings of virtually all of Mendelssohn&#x27;s published works are now available, and his works are frequently heard in the concert hall and on broadcasts. 
R. Larry Todd noted in 2007, in the context of the impending bicentenary of Mendelssohn&#x27;s birth, &quot;the intensifying revival of the composer&#x27;s music over the past few decades&quot;, and that &quot;his image has been largely rehabilitated, as musicians and scholars have returned to this paradoxically familiar but unfamiliar European classical composer, and have begun viewing him from new perspectives.&quot;

<text>Sweet Smell of Success is a 1957 American film noir satirical drama film directed by Alexander Mackendrick, starring Burt Lancaster, Tony Curtis, Susan Harrison, and Martin Milner, and written by Clifford Odets, Ernest Lehman, and Mackendrick from the novelette by Lehman. The shadowy noir cinematography filmed on location in New York City was shot by James Wong Howe. The picture was produced by James Hill of Hecht-Hill-Lancaster Productions and released by United Artists. The supporting cast features Sam Levene, Barbara Nichols, Joe Frisco, Edith Atwater, David White, and Emile Meyer. The musical score was arranged and conducted by Elmer Bernstein and the film also features jazz performances by the Chico Hamilton Quintet. Mary Grant designed the costumes.

The film tells the story of powerful and sleazy newspaper columnist J.J. Hunsecker (portrayed by Lancaster and based on Walter Winchell) who uses his connections to ruin his sister&#x27;s relationship with a man he deems unworthy of her.

Despite a poorly received preview screening, &quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot; has greatly improved in stature over the years. It grew to become highly acclaimed by film critics, particularly for its cinematography and screenplay. In 1993, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

==Plot==
One night in Manhattan, slick, up-and-coming press agent Sidney Falco scans the &quot;New York Globe&quot; for the column of the immensely popular journalist J.J. Hunsecker, an influential media kingpin whose journalistic contributions and associated radio show both dominate the entertainment world. For the fifth consecutive day, J.J. has neglected to publicize any of Sidney&#x27;s clients, as he is overly protective of his 19-year-old younger sister Susan and has asked Sidney to end her recent affair with Steve Dallas, a budding jazz guitarist.

Later, at the Elysian Room, where Steve performs with his group, the Chico Hamilton Quintet, Sidney argues with his uncle and Steve&#x27;s manager, Frank D’Angelo, who has promised him that Steve and Susan will part. Upon learning from his girlfriend Rita, a cigarette girl, that Susan is awaiting Steve behind the club, he interrupts the pair&#x27;s celebration. Steve, who mainly values integrity, angrily accuses him of “scratching for information like a dog.” Inside, Rita appeals to Sidney to help her retain her job, which is at risk because she refused to sleep with J. J.’s main competitor, the prominent columnist Leo Bartha, who then ordered her dismissal. After Sidney secures a date with Rita, Susan questions his relationship with J.J. inside a cab, but he reassures her that J.J. is a close friend of his. Outside the 21 Club, J.J. greets his informer, Harry Kello, a corrupt police lieutenant, who is long indebted to J. J. for petitioning the mayor to save his job after Kello beat a suspect severely. When Sidney reveals Steve&#x27;s and Susan&#x27;s engagement, J.J. gives him an ultimatum to destroy their relationship. Desperate to salvage his career, he vows not to disappoint J.J.

Sidney attempts to blackmail Leo at Toots Shor&#x27;s Restaurant and Lounge by threatening to expose his marital infidelity with Rita unless Leo prints a defamatory gossip item stating that Steve is a Communist who smokes marijuana. Instead, Leo chooses exposure over compromising his journalistic integrity, which even his wife Loretta praises as his first decent act in years. Sidney then bribes another columnist, Otis Elwell, who agrees to print the item if Sidney will arrange for him to receive a sexual favor from an &quot;available&quot; woman. At his apartment, Rita balks at the implications of getting acquainted with Otis, but ultimately assents to Sidney&#x27;s plan in order to stay employed. The next morning, the smear appears in Otis&#x27;s column and the Chico Hamilton Quartet is fired.

As planned, J.J. theatrically gets Steve rehired with a phone call in front of Susan, but Steve rebukes him for being a malignant influence on society. Forced to choose between them, an overwhelmed Susan breaks up with Steve, hoping to save him from J.J.&#x27;s vengeance. Planning to destroy Steve&#x27;s career, an incensed J.J. orders Sidney to plant marijuana on Steve; a shocked Sidney balks, saying he can accept a dog collar but not a noose, but once J. J. offers to let Sidney write his column for three months while he vacations with Susan in Europe, he acquiesces.

At the Elysian Room, Sidney slips the cigarettes into the pocket of Steve&#x27;s coat. Once Steve finishes work that evening, Kello accosts him outside and so assaults him that he is hospitalized. At a bar, surrounded by his industry cohorts, Sidney celebrates his accomplishment but is then summoned to J.J.&#x27;s penthouse apartment. He arrives to find a distraught Susan in her nightgown, about to commit suicide by jumping off the balcony. He barely rescues her, and takes her into her bedroom to rest. Upon arriving to find the two holding each other, J.J. harshly scolds him. Realizing that Susan set him up, Sidney irately reveals to her that J.J. conspired to frame Steve; he then departs, vowing to reveal the truth and informing J.J. that Susan is permanently lost to him. J.J. then calls Kello and tells him Steve is innocent, ordering Sidney to be arrested for planting the evidence. As Sidney exits the building, Kello stops and brutally beats him.

As Susan packs her belongings, J.J. unsuccessfully begs her to stay; she coolly informs him that death is preferable to living with him. An overwrought J.J. watches from the balcony as she strides into the coming dawn to start life afresh with her lover.

==Cast==
==Production==
Faced with potential unemployment from the sale of Ealing Studios to the BBC in 1954, director Alexander Mackendrick began entertaining offers from Hollywood. He rejected potential contracts from Cary Grant and David Selznick and signed with independent production company Hecht-Hill-Lancaster, enticed by their offer to adapt George Bernard Shaw’s play &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Disciple&quot;. After the project collapsed during pre-production, Mackendrick asked to be released from his commitment. Harold Hecht refused and asked him to start work on another project – adapting Ernest Lehman’s novellette &quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot; into a film.

Lehman’s story had originally appeared in the April 1950 issue of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, renamed &quot;Tell Me About It Tomorrow!&quot; because the editor of the magazine did not want the word &quot;smell&quot; in the publication. It was based on his own experiences working as an assistant to Irving Hoffman, a New York press agent and columnist for &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;. Hoffman subsequently did not speak to Lehman for a year and a half. Hoffman then wrote a column for &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; speculating that Lehman would make a good screenwriter, and within a week Paramount called Lehman, inviting him to Los Angeles for talks. Lehman forged a screenwriting career in Hollywood, writing &quot;Executive Suite&quot;, &quot;Sabrina,&quot; &quot;North by Northwest,&quot; &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, &quot;West Side Story&quot;, &quot;The King and I&quot;, and &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot;.

===Pre-production===
By the time Hecht-Hill-Lancaster acquired &quot;Success&quot;, Lehman was in position to not only adapt his own novelette but also produce and direct the film. After scouting locations, Lehman was told by Hecht that distributor United Artists was having second thoughts about going with a first-time director, so Hecht offered the film to Mackendrick. Initially, the director had reservations about trying to film such a dialogue-heavy screenplay, so he and Lehman worked on it for weeks to make it more cinematic. As the script neared completion, Lehman became ill and had to resign from the picture. James Hill took over and offered Paddy Chayefsky as Lehman&#x27;s replacement. Mackendrick suggested Clifford Odets, the playwright whose reputation as a left-wing hero had been tarnished after he named names before the House Un-American Activities Committee.

Mackendrick assumed that Odets would need only two or three weeks to polish the script, but he took four months. The director recalled, &quot;We started shooting with no final script at all, while Clifford reconstructed the thing from stem to stern&quot;. The plot was largely intact, but in Mackendrick&#x27;s biography he is quoted from &quot;Notes on Sweet Smell of Success&quot;: &quot;What Clifford did, in effect, was dismantle the structure of every single sequence in order to rebuild situations and relationships that were much more complex, had much greater tension and more dramatic energy&quot;. This process took time, and the start date for the production could not be delayed. Odets had to accompany the production to Manhattan and continued rewriting while they shot there. Returning to the city that had shunned him for going to Hollywood made Odets very neurotic and obsessed with all kinds of rituals as he worked at a furious pace, with pages often going straight from his typewriter to being shot the same day. Mackendrick said, &quot;So we cut the script there on the floor, with the actors, just cutting down lines, making them more spare – what Clifford would have done himself, really, had there been time&quot;.

Tony Curtis had to fight for the role of Sidney Falco because Universal, the studio to which he was contracted, was worried that it would ruin his career. Tired of doing pretty-boy roles and wanting to prove that he could act, Curtis got his way. Orson Welles was originally considered for the role of J. J. Hunsecker. Mackendrick wanted to cast Hume Cronyn because he felt that Cronyn closely resembled Walter Winchell, the basis for the Hunsecker character in the novelette. Lehman made the distinction in an interview that Winchell was the inspiration for the version of the character in the novelette, and that this differs from the character in the film version. United Artists wanted Burt Lancaster in the role because of his box office appeal and his successful pairing with Curtis on &quot;Trapeze&quot;. Robert Vaughn was signed to a contract with Lancaster&#x27;s film company and was to have played the Steve Dallas role but was drafted into the Army before he could begin the film. Ernest Borgnine, contracted to Hecht-Hill-Lancaster since &quot;Marty&quot; (1955) was offered a role in the film but turned it down as his role was only seven pages long in the script. His refusal led him to be put on suspension from Hecht-Hill-Lancaster.

Hecht-Hill-Lancaster allowed Mackendrick to familiarize himself with New York City before shooting the movie. In &quot;Notes on Sweet Smell of Success&quot;, Mackendrick said, &quot;One of the characteristic aspects of New York, particularly of the area between 42nd Street and 57th Street, is the neurotic energy of the crowded sidewalks. This was, I argued, essential to the story of characters driven by the uglier aspects of ambition and greed&quot;. He took multiple photographs of the city from several fixed points and taped the pictures into a series of panoramas that he stuck on a wall and studied once he got back to Hollywood.

Cellist Fred Katz and drummer Chico Hamilton, who briefly appear in the film as themselves, wrote a score for the movie, which was ultimately rejected in favor of one by Elmer Bernstein.

===Principal photography===
Mackendrick shot the film in late 1956, and was scared the entire time because Hecht-Hill-Lancaster had a reputation for firing their directors for any or even no reason at all. The filmmaker was used to extensive rehearsals before a scene was shot and often found himself shooting a script page one or two hours after Odets had written it. Lancaster&#x27;s presence proved to be intimidating for numerous individuals involved with the production; at one point, Lehman had been approached to direct the film, but declined due to his fear of Lancaster, although Hecht maintained that Lehman had never been offered the chance to direct. Mackendrick and composer Elmer Bernstein both found Lancaster intimidating, with Bernstein later recalling, &quot;Burt was really scary. He was a dangerous guy. He had a short fuse&quot;. Mackendrick decided to use Lancaster&#x27;s volatility to work for the character of JJ, asking that Lancaster wear his own browline glasses, which Mackendrick felt gave him the presence of &quot;a scholarly brute&quot;. Mackendrick smeared a thin layer of vaseline on the lenses, preventing Lancaster from focusing his eyes and giving him a perpetually blank gaze. Assisted by cinematographer James Wong Howe, Mackendrick intentionally filmed scenes with JJ from a low angle using a wide-angle lens and with overhead lighting directly above Lancaster, so that the spectacle frames cast shadows on his face.

Shooting on location in New York City also added to Mackendrick&#x27;s anxieties. Exteriors were shot in the busiest, noisiest areas with crowds of young Tony Curtis fans occasionally breaking through police barriers. Mackendrick remembered, &quot;We started shooting in Times Square at rush hour, and we had high-powered actors and a camera crane and police help and all the rest of it, but we didn’t have any script. We knew where we were going vaguely, but that’s all&quot;.

==Musical score and soundtrack==
==Reaction==
A preview screening of &quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot; was poorly received, as Tony Curtis fans were expecting him to play one of his typical nice guy roles and instead were presented with the scheming Sidney Falco. Mackendrick remembered seeing audience members &quot;curling up, crossing their arms and legs, recoiling from the screen in disgust&quot;. Burt Lancaster&#x27;s fans were not thrilled with their idol either, &quot;finding the film too static and talky&quot;.

The film was a box-office failure, and Hecht blamed his producing partner Hill. &quot;The night of the preview, Harold said to me, &#x27;You know you&#x27;ve wrecked our company? We&#x27;re going to lose over a million dollars on this picture, Hill recalled. According to Lehman, Lancaster blamed him, claiming that: &quot;Burt threatened me at a party after the preview. He said, &#x27;You didn&#x27;t have to leave – you could have made this a much better picture. I ought to beat you up.&#x27; I said, &#x27;Go ahead – I could use the money.

&quot;Variety&quot; estimated the film lost at least $400,000 on its initial run.

Although he and Hecht would fire Mackendrick from &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Disciple&quot; for the same painstaking (and costly) approach, Lancaster was quoted as saying that he felt Mackendrick had done a fantastic job for &quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot; and that it wasn&#x27;t his fault the film lost money. He also believed that Curtis should have gotten an Oscar for his role as Falco.

&quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot; premiered in New York at Loew&#x27;s State in Times Square on June 27, 1957. Critical reaction was much more favorable. &quot;Time&quot; magazine said the movie was &quot;raised to considerable dramatic heights by intense acting, taut direction ... superb camera work ... and, above all, by its whiplash dialogue&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; and the &quot;New York Herald&quot; included the film on their ten-best lists for films released in 1957. The film&#x27;s critical reputation increased in subsequent decades. David Denby in &quot;New York&quot; magazine later called it &quot;the most acrid, and the best&quot; of all New York movies because it captured, &quot;better than any film I know the atmosphere of Times Square and big-city journalism&quot;.

&quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot; holds a 98% &quot;Certified Fresh&quot; rating based on 61 reviews at Rotten Tomatoes; the critical consensus explains, &quot;&quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot; boasts a top-notch cast, sharp direction, atmospheric cinematography, and an appropriately jazzy score, making it one of the best noir crime thrillers ever made.&quot; At Metacritic it has a weighted average score rating of 100 out of 100 based on 5 reviews. According to The Guardian, British press assessed it a perfect 10/10 based on reviews from multiple British newspapers. A. O. Scott wrote in March 2002 for &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;Courtesy of Ernest Lehman and Clifford Odets, a high-toned street vernacular that no real New Yorker has ever spoken but that every real New Yorker wishes he could&quot;. Andrew Sarris in the &quot;New York Observer&quot;, again in 2002, wrote, &quot;the main incentive to see this movie is its witty, pungent and idiomatic dialogue, such as you never hear on the screen anymore in this age of special-effects illiteracy&quot;.

===Legacy===
In 1993 (the year Mackendrick died), the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

In 2002, &quot;Sweet Smell of Success: The Musical&quot; was created by Marvin Hamlisch, Craig Carnelia and John Guare. It was not considered a critical or commercial success.

In its &quot;100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains&quot; list, the American Film Institute (AFI) named J. J. Hunsecker number 35 of the top 50 movie villains of all time in 2003.

Filmmaker Barry Levinson paid tribute to &quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot; in his 1982 film &quot;Diner&quot;, with one character wandering around saying nothing but lines from the film. In an early scene from Levinson&#x27;s 1988 movie, &quot;Rain Man&quot;, &quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot; is seen playing on television.

The &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; episode &quot;Contract&quot; is an homage to the film, with Mo Rocca playing a gossip columnist who is clearly based on J.J. (in both appearance and attitude) and other characters from the episode quoting the film&#x27;s lines many times.

The titles of episodes two and three from the first season of &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; — &quot;Cat&#x27;s in the Bag...&quot; and &quot;...And the Bag&#x27;s in the River&quot; — are a direct quote from &quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot;, which has been described by the show&#x27;s creator, Vince Gilligan, as his all-time favorite movie.

<doc id="76377" wikidata="Q2037090" url="?curid=76377" title="The Tall T">
<text>The Tall T is a 1957 American Western film directed by Budd Boetticher and starring Randolph Scott, Richard Boone, and Maureen O&#x27;Sullivan. Adapted by Burt Kennedy from the 1955 short story &quot;The Captives&quot; by Elmore Leonard, the film is about an independent former ranch foreman who is kidnapped along with an heiress, who is being held for ransom by three ruthless outlaws. In 2000, &quot;The Tall T&quot; was selected for the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

==Plot==
Passing a stagecoach on his journey into town, Pat Brennan agrees to return with some store-bought candy for the friendly station manager&#x27;s young son. At a ranch where he once worked, Brennan tries to buy a bull, but is talked into riding one. If he wins, he gets the bull. If he loses he has to give up his horse. Brennan loses, and is forced to walk home, carrying his saddle.

He manages to get a lift from stagecoach driver Rintoon, an acquaintance of Brennan&#x27;s from town, who has been hired specially to transport the newlyweds Willard and Doretta Mims. Doretta is a plain woman, but the daughter of a rich copper mine owner. It tickles Brennan, who tells Rintoon this is the first time he&#x27;s ever been on a honeymoon.

When they stop at the way-station, they are mistaken for the regular stage by three outlaws, Chink, Billy Jack, and their leader, Frank Usher, who have already killed the station manager and his son. Rintoon goes for his shotgun, only to be killed by gun-happy Chink.

Terrified of sharing the same fate, Willard suggests to the outlaws that ransoming his wife would be far more profitable than robbing the stage. Frank likes the idea. He also immediately recognises, and is disgusted by, the groom&#x27;s clear lack of devotion to his bride.

The outlaw leader takes a liking to Brennan, later telling him that under different circumstances the two of them might have been friends. After ordering Billy Jack to ride along with Willard and deliver a ransom note demanding $50,000 to Doretta&#x27;s father, Frank takes the woman and Brennan to a remote hideout. Willard returns, saying his father-in-law has agreed and is gathering the money. Willard is told he is no longer needed and can leave. A coward, he does not even bother to say goodbye to his new wife, which deepens Frank&#x27;s disgust for him. As Willard begins to ride off, Chink ruthlessly shoots him down.

Brennan knows full well that he and Doretta will also end up dead once the ransom is paid. He tells the distraught widow to collect herself and be ready to take any opportunity for life that presents itself. He then takes her in his arms. She hesitates, then kisses him. She confesses she married Willard because she was getting older and did not want to be alone.

Billy Jack and Chink are left behind to guard the hostages while Frank goes off to collect the money. Brennan plants the thought that their ringleader might just ride off alone with all the money, so Chink leaves the camp to keep an eye out for Frank. Brennan suggests to Billy Jack that he take advantage of Doretta, a lonely woman denied even her wedding night. Billy Jack does indeed try to force himself on Doretta, whereupon Brennan overpowers him and shoots him dead.

Chink hears the shots and turns back. Brennan kills him. Frank then returns with the money. Brennan however gets the drop on him, so Frank surrenders his revolver and the money. He slowly walks away, gambling that Brennan will not shoot him in the back. He mounts his horse and rides off. However, he has a rifle stowed in his saddle, so he pulls it and turns around; he rides back towards Brennan, who is forced to kill the outlaw. Walking away, side by side, Doretta reaches for Brennan&#x27;s arm, which he places around her. He tells her it is going to be a good day.

<doc id="76379" wikidata="Q1145582" url="?curid=76379" title="The Tell-Tale Heart (1953 American film)">
<text>The Tell-Tale Heart is a 1953 American animated psychological horror short film produced by UPA, directed by Ted Parmelee, and narrated by James Mason. The screenplay by Bill Scott and Fred Grable is based on the 1843 short story of the same name by Edgar Allan Poe. The British Board of Film Censors made this the first cartoon to receive an adults-only X certificate in the United Kingdom.

== Plot ==
A murderer&#x27;s increasing guilt leads him to believe he can hear his victim&#x27;s heart still beating beneath the floorboards where he buried him. Seen through the eyes of the nameless narrator, the surrealistic images help convey his descent into madness.

== Production ==
Paul Julian served as both designer and color artist for film, and Pat Matthews was the principal animator.

In May 1953, pre-production started on &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot;, which originally was intended to be a 3-D film. It is not known if the film was animated in this fashion, but it was not released in 3D. There is no reference to 3D in a technical trade review. Furthermore, the leaders on original prints of the film do not indicate it ever was part of a pair of 3D prints.

== Reception ==
The film was the first cartoon to be rated X, indicating it was suitable only for adult audiences, by the British Board of Film Censors. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film but lost to &quot;Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom&quot; from Walt Disney Productions.

In 1994, animation historian Jerry Beck surveyed 1000 people working in the animation industry and published the results in &quot;The 50 Greatest Cartoons: As Selected by 1,000 Animation Professionals&quot;, in which &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot; ranked #24.

In 2001, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film &quot;culturally significant&quot; and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.

== Availability ==
The short is included as a bonus feature on the first DVD release of &quot;Hellboy&quot;. It is also included, with commentary by Leonard Maltin and Jerry Beck, on disc 2 of &quot;The Jolly Frolics Collection&quot;.

<doc id="76381" wikidata="Q206937" url="?curid=76381" title="Civil procedure">
<text>Civil procedure is the body of law that sets out the rules and regulations along with some standards that courts follow when adjudicating civil lawsuits (as opposed to procedures in criminal law matters). These rules govern how a lawsuit or case may be commenced; what kind of service of process (if any) is required; the types of pleadings or statements of case, motions or applications, and orders allowed in civil cases; the timing and manner of depositions and discovery or disclosure; the conduct of trials; the process for judgment; the process for post-trial procedures; various available remedies; and how the courts and clerks must function.

==Differences from criminal procedure==
In most cases, criminal prosecutions are pursued by the state in order to punish offenders, although some systems, such as in English and French law, allow citizens to bring a private prosecution. Conversely, civil actions are initiated by private individuals, companies or organizations, for their own benefit. Government agencies may also be a party to civil actions. Civil and criminal cases are usually heard in different courts.

In jurisdictions based on English common-law systems, the party bringing a criminal charge (in most cases, the state) is called the &quot;prosecution&quot;, but the party bringing most forms of civil action is the &quot;plaintiff&quot; or &quot;claimant&quot;. In both kinds of action the other party is known as the &quot;defendant&quot;. A criminal case against a person called Ms. Sanchez would be described as &quot;The People v. (= &quot;versus&quot;, &quot;against&quot; or &quot;and&quot;) Sanchez&quot;, &quot;The State (or Commonwealth) v. Sanchez&quot; or &quot;[The name of the State] v. Sanchez&quot; in the United States and &quot;R. (&quot;Rex&quot;, Latin for &quot;King&quot; but spoken as &quot;The Crown&quot;) v. Sanchez&quot; in England and Wales, amongst other Commonwealth realms. But a civil action between Ms. Sanchez and a Mr. Smith would be &quot;Sanchez v. Smith&quot; if it were started by Sanchez, and &quot;Smith v. Sanchez&quot; if it were started by Mr. Smith (though the order of parties&#x27; names can change if the case is appealed).

Most countries make a clear distinction between civil and criminal procedure. For example, a criminal court may force a convicted defendant to pay a fine as punishment for their crime, and the legal costs of both the prosecution and defence. But the victim of the crime generally pursues their claim for compensation in a civil, not a criminal, action. In France and England, however, a victim of a crime may incidentally be awarded compensation by a criminal court judge.

Evidence from a criminal trial is generally admissible as evidence in a civil action about the same matter. For example, the victim of a road accident does not directly benefit if the driver who injured them is found guilty of the crime of careless driving. The victim still has to prove his case in a civil action, unless the doctrine of collateral estoppel applies, as it does in most American jurisdictions. The victim may be able to prove their civil case even when the driver is found not guilty in the criminal trial, because the standard to determine guilt is higher than the standard to determine fault. However, if a driver is found by a civil jury not to have been negligent, a prosecutor may be estopped from charging them criminally.

If the plaintiff has shown that the defendant is liable, the main remedy in a civil court is the amount of money, or &quot;damages&quot;, which the defendant should pay to the plaintiff. Alternative civil remedies include restitution or transfer of property, or an injunction to restrain or order certain actions.

The standards of proof are higher in a criminal case than in a civil one, since the state does not wish to risk punishing an innocent person. In English law the prosecution must prove the guilt of a criminal &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot;; but the plaintiff in a civil action is required to prove his case &quot;on the balance of probabilities&quot;. Thus, in a criminal case a crime cannot be proven if the person or persons judging it doubt the guilt of the suspect and have a reason (not just a feeling or intuition) for this doubt. But in a civil case, the court will weigh all the evidence and decide what is most probable.

Civil procedure is traditionally divided into inquisitorial and adversarial.

<doc id="76383" wikidata="Q746733" url="?curid=76383" title="The Ten Commandments (1956 film)">
<text>The Ten Commandments is a 1956 American epic religious drama film produced, directed, and narrated by Cecil B. DeMille, shot in VistaVision (color by Technicolor), and released by Paramount Pictures. Based on the biblical Book of Exodus and other sources, it dramatizes the story of the life of Moses, an adopted Egyptian prince who becomes the deliverer of his real brethren, the enslaved Hebrews, and thereafter leads the Exodus to Mount Sinai, where he receives, from God, the Ten Commandments. The film stars Charlton Heston in the lead role, Yul Brynner as Rameses, Anne Baxter as Nefretiri, Edward G. Robinson as Dathan, Yvonne De Carlo as Sephora, Debra Paget as Lilia, and John Derek as Joshua; and features Sir Cedric Hardwicke as Seti I, Nina Foch as Bithiah, Martha Scott as Yochabel, Judith Anderson as Memnet, and Vincent Price as Baka, among others.

Filmed on location in Egypt, Mount Sinai, and the Sinai Peninsula, &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; was DeMille&#x27;s most successful work, his first widescreen film, his fourth biblical production, and his final directorial effort before his death in 1959. It is a remake of the prologue of his 1923 silent film of the same title, and features one of the largest exterior sets ever created for a motion picture. Four screenwriters, three art directors, and five costume designers worked on the film. The interior sets were constructed on Paramount&#x27;s Hollywood soundstages. The original roadshow version included an onscreen introduction by DeMille and was released to cinemas in the United States on November 8, 1956, and, at the time of its release, was the most expensive film ever made.

In 1957, the film was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, winning the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects (John P. Fulton, A.S.C.). DeMille won the Foreign Language Press Film Critics Circle Award for Best Director. Charlton Heston was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture (Drama). Yul Brynner won the National Board of Review Award for Best Actor. Heston, Anne Baxter, and Yvonne De Carlo won Laurel Awards for Best Dramatic Actor, 5th Best Dramatic Actress, and 3rd Best Supporting Actress, respectively. It is also one of the most financially successful films ever made, grossing approximately $122.7 million at the box office during its initial release; it was the most successful film of 1956 and the second-highest-grossing film of the decade. According to &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, in terms of theatrical exhibition, it is the eighth most successful film of all-time when the box office gross is adjusted for inflation.

In 1999, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. In June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its &quot;Ten Top Ten&quot;—the best ten films in ten American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. The film was listed as the tenth best film in the epic genre. The film has aired annually on U.S. network television in prime time during the Passover/Easter season since 1973.

== Plot ==
After hearing the prophecy of a Hebrew deliverer, Pharaoh Rameses I of Egypt orders the death of all newborn Hebrew males. Yochabel saves her infant son by setting him adrift in a basket on the Nile. Bithiah, the Pharaoh Rameses&#x27;s recently widowed daughter (and sister of the future Pharaoh Seti I), finds the basket and decides to adopt the boy, even though her servant, Memnet, recognizes that the child is Hebrew. Bithiah names the baby Moses.

Prince Moses grows up to become a successful general, winning a war with Ethiopia and establishing an alliance. Moses falls in love with the princess Nefretiri. But, she is betrothed to whomever Seti chooses to become the next Pharaoh. While working on the building of a city for Pharaoh Seti I&#x27;s jubilee, Moses meets the stonecutter Joshua, who tells him of the Hebrew God. Moses saves an elderly woman from being crushed, not knowing that she is his biological mother, Yochabel, and he reprimands the master builder, Baka.

Moses reforms the treatment of slaves on the project, but Prince Rameses, Moses&#x27;s adoptive brother and Seti&#x27;s son, charges him with planning an insurrection. Moses says he is making his workers more productive, making Rameses wonder if Moses is the man the Hebrews are calling the Deliverer.

Nefretiri learns from Memnet that Moses is the son of Hebrew slaves. She kills Memnet, but reveals the story to Moses after he finds the piece of Levite cloth he was wrapped in as a baby, which Memnet had kept. Moses follows Bithiah to Yochabel&#x27;s house, where he meets his biological mother, brother Aaron, and sister Miriam.

Moses learns more about the slaves by working with them. Nefretiri urges him to return to the palace, so that he may help his people when he becomes pharaoh, to which he agrees after he completes a final task. Moses saves Joshua from death by killing Baka, telling Joshua that he, too, is Hebrew. The confession is witnessed by the Hebrew overseer Dathan, who then reports to Prince Rameses. After being arrested, Moses explains that he is not the Deliverer, but would free the slaves if he could. Seti I declares Prince Rameses his sole heir, and Rameses banishes Moses to the desert. At this time, Moses learns of the death of his mother.

Moses makes his way across the desert to a well in Midian. After defending seven sisters from Amalekites, Moses is housed with the girls&#x27; father Jethro, a Bedouin sheik, who worships the God of Abraham. Moses marries Jethro&#x27;s eldest daughter Zipporah (called Sephora in the film). Later, he finds Joshua, who has escaped from the hard labor imposed on the Hebrews in Egypt. While herding, Moses sees the burning bush on the summit of Mount Sinai and hears the voice of God. At God&#x27;s command, Moses returns to Egypt to free the Hebrews.

Moses comes before Rameses, now Pharaoh Rameses II, to win the slaves&#x27; freedom, turning his staff into a cobra. Jannes performs the same trick with his staves, but Moses&#x27;s snake swallows his. Rameses prohibits straw from being provided to the Hebrews to make their bricks. Nefretiri rescues Moses from being stoned to death by the Hebrews wherein he reveals that he is married.

Egypt is visited by plagues. Moses turns the river Nile to blood at a festival of Khnum, and brings burning hail down upon Pharaoh&#x27;s palace. Moses warns him that the next plague to fall upon Egypt will be summoned by Pharaoh himself. Enraged at the plagues, Rameses orders that all first-born sons of Hebrews will die, but a cloud of death instead kills all the first-born sons of Egypt, including the child of Rameses and Nefretiri. Despairing at the loss of his heir, Pharaoh exiles the Hebrews, who begin the Exodus from Egypt.

After being taunted by Nefretiri, Rameses takes his chariots and pursues the Hebrews to the Red Sea. Moses uses God&#x27;s help to stop the Egyptians with a pillar of fire, and parts the Red Sea. After the Hebrews make it to safety, Moses releases the walls of water, drowning the Egyptian army. A devastated Rameses returns empty-handed to Nefretiri, stating that he now acknowledges Moses&#x27;s god as God.

Moses again ascends the mountain with Joshua. He sees the Ten Commandments created by God in two stone tablets. Meanwhile, Dathan exploits the people to gain power; claiming that Moses is dead and urging a reluctant Aaron to construct a golden calf idol. A wild saturnalia occurs and a decadent orgy is held by most of the Hebrews.
After God informs him of the Hebrew&#x27;s sins, Moses descends from the mountain with Joshua. Enraged at his own people&#x27;s betrayal of God, he deems the Hebrews unworthy and smashes the tablets at the golden calf. The calf explodes, sending Dathan and the other sinners to Hell. The remaining Hebrews are forced to wander in the wilderness for forty years. An elderly Moses later leads the Hebrews towards Canaan. However, he cannot enter the Promised Land because of a previous disobedience to the Lord (angering God at the Water of Strife). He instead names Joshua as leader, and bids farewell to the Hebrews at Mount Nebo.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
In July 1951, while he was working on his circus film &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot;, producer-director Cecil B. DeMille chose Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; as the subject of his next epic. Several weeks later, he announced he was going to make a film about the Book of Esther, but then he changed his mind and said he was planning a new film about Helen of Troy, which he eventually canceled. In June 1952, DeMille informed the press that his next production would be a Technicolor remake of his successful silent film &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1923). From the beginning, his plan was to produce the film on a &quot;lavish scale&quot; with &quot;a cast of outstanding stars&quot; and a budget that would allow it &quot;to possess the quality and spectacular values that have earned for DeMille the title of &#x27;Hollywood&#x27;s master showman.&#x27;&quot; DeMille explained why he decided to revisit Moses&#x27; story:
Moses&#x27; biography is found in the Hebrew Bible&#x27;s Torah, also called the &quot;Five Books of Moses&quot;. In order to depict Moses&#x27; early years in Egypt, DeMille searched for extrabiblical sources that expanded on Moses&#x27; life as a young man. He bought the screen rights to Dorothy Clarke Wilson&#x27;s best-selling novel &quot;Prince of Egypt&quot;, from which he got the &quot;lively&quot; Nefertari (spelled &quot;Nefretiri&quot; in both the novel and the film) and her romance with Moses. He also found a novel about Moses titled &quot;On Eagle&#x27;s Wings&quot; by English minister and author Arthur Eustace Southon, who sold the screen rights to DeMille. The film was also based on &quot;Pillar of Fire&quot; by Joseph Holt Ingraham. Henry Noerdlinger, the film&#x27;s researcher, consulted ancient historical texts such as the Midrash Rabbah, Philo&#x27;s &quot;Life of Moses&quot;, and the writings of Josephus and Eusebius, in order to &quot;fill in&quot; the missing years of Moses&#x27; life, and, as the film&#x27;s last opening title card states, &quot;the Holy Scriptures&quot;.

The final shooting script was written by Aeneas MacKenzie, Jesse L. Lasky Jr., Jack Gariss, and Fredric M. Frank.

=== Casting ===
==== Leading roles ====

During the early stages of pre-production, DeMille considered casting a middle-aged man in the role of Moses. He offered the part to fifty-six year old actor and Hopalong Cassidy star William Boyd, but Boyd turned it down because he felt his cowboy fame would interfere with his portrayal of Moses. Charlton Heston, who had previously worked with DeMille in &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot;, finally won the role after he impressed DeMille (at his audition) with his knowledge of ancient Egypt and his strong resemblance to Michelangelo&#x27;s sculpture of Moses. Heston was also chosen to be the voice of God in the form of a burning bush, toned down to a softer and lower register.

DeMille described the role of Rameses II as &quot;a part equal in dramatic strength to that of Moses&quot;. Rory Calhoun, Jeff Chandler, Anthony Dexter, Mel Ferrer, Stewart Granger, William Holden, and Michael Rennie were considered to play the film&#x27;s leading antagonist. DeMille saw Yul Brynner in the Broadway musical &quot;The King and I&quot;, and went backstage to meet him. He told Brynner the story of the film from Rameses&#x27; point of view, and offered him the role.
Columnist Louella Parsons regarded the part of Nefretiri as &quot;the most sought-after role of the year&quot;. Ann Blyth, Vanessa Brown, Joan Evans, Rhonda Fleming, Coleen Gray, Jane Griffiths, Audrey Hepburn, Vivien Leigh, Jane Russell, and Joan Taylor were considered to portray the film&#x27;s leading female character. DeMille liked Audrey Hepburn, but ruled her out when he noticed her figure was not curvaceous enough for Nefretiri&#x27;s extravagant costumes. Anne Baxter was cast in the role. &quot;There was only one DeMille, and there wasn&#x27;t an actor in the world who didn&#x27;t want to work for him just once, however short the salary or tall the corn&quot;, she wrote in her memoir.

Many actors were considered for the role of the evil overseer Dathan, including Raymond Burr, Lee J. Cobb, Leo Genn, Victor Jory, Fredric March, Raymond Massey, Stephen McNally, Gary Merrill, Arnold Moss, Robert Newton, Hugh O&#x27;Brian, Jack Palance, Eric Pohlmann, Basil Rathbone, Dale Robertson, Robert Ryan, George Sanders, Everett Sloane, and Peter Ustinov. DeMille was enthusiastic about Jack Palance as Dathan, but Palance&#x27;s agent angered DeMille when he stole a part of the script and demanded that the part be rewritten. Raymond Massey was signed for the role, but later turned it down. DeMille then chose Edward G. Robinson, who was blacklisted in Hollywood. In his autobiography, Robinson remembered, &quot;Mr. DeMille ... felt I had been done an injustice, and told his people to offer me the part. Cecil B. DeMille returned me to films. Cecil B. DeMille restored my self-respect.&quot;

The name of Moses&#x27; wife, Zipporah, was changed to &quot;Sephora&quot;, the spelling that appears in the Douay–Rheims Bible. Judith Ames, Anne Bancroft, Anne Baxter, Shirley Booth, Diane Brewster, Peggie Castle, June Clayworth, Linda Darnell, Laura Elliot, Rhonda Fleming, Rita Gam, Grace Kelly, Jacqueline Green, Barbara Hale, Allison Hayes, Frances Lansing, Patricia Neal, Marie Palmer, Jean Peters, Ruth Roman, Barbara Rush, and Elizabeth Sellars were considered for the part. Grace Kelly, DeMille&#x27;s first choice, was unavailable. DeMille was &quot;very much impressed&quot; with Yvonne De Carlo&#x27;s performance as a &quot;saintly type of woman&quot; in MGM&#x27;s &quot;Sombrero&quot;. He &quot;sensed in her a depth, an emotional power, a womanly strength which the part of Sephora needed and which she gave it&quot;.

==== Supporting roles ====

DeMille considered Pier Angeli, Vanessa Brown, Pat Crowley, Piper Laurie, Irene Montwill, Lori Nelson, Cathy O&#x27;Donnell, Jean Peters, Donna Reed, Karen Sharpe, and Elaine Stewart for the part of the Hebrew water girl, Lilia. He wanted to cast Pier Angeli in the role, but MGM refused to loan their contract star to Paramount. Debra Paget was loaned from 20th Century-Fox.

Jeff Chandler, Tony Curtis, Vince Edwards, Eric Fleming, Arthur Franz, Rock Hudson, Brian Keith, Cameron Mitchell, George Nader, Jack Palance, Michael Pate, Richard Todd, Clint Walker, and Cornel Wilde were considered for the role of the stonecutter Joshua. DeMille&#x27;s first choice was Wilde, who had worked with him in &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot;. Wilde&#x27;s casting was widely mentioned in the press. DeMille later remarked, &quot;Cornel Wilde declined the role ... thus giving John Derek his opportunity for a noteworthy performance.&quot;

Claudette Colbert (the star of DeMille&#x27;s &quot;Cleopatra&quot;), Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Rosemary DeCamp, Irene Dunne, Merle Oberon, and Alexis Smith were considered for the role of Bithiah, before DeMille chose Jayne Meadows (who declined) and finally cast Nina Foch, on the suggestion of Henry Wilcoxon, who had worked with her in &quot;Scaramouche&quot;.

For the role of Memnet, Flora Robson was considered, and Bette Davis was interviewed (DeMille&#x27;s casting journal also notes Marjorie Rambeau and Marie Windsor), but DeMille chose Judith Anderson after screening Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Rebecca&quot;.

Heston&#x27;s newborn son, Fraser (born February 12, 1955), was cast by DeMille (on the suggestion of Henry Wilcoxon, who said to him: &quot;The timing&#x27;s just right. If it&#x27;s a boy, who better to play the Baby Moses?&quot;) as soon as Heston announced to DeMille that his wife Lydia was pregnant. Fraser Heston was three months old during filming.

Henry Wilcoxon&#x27;s wife, Joan Woodbury, was cast as Korah&#x27;s wife in the Golden Calf sequence.

DeMille was reluctant to cast anyone who had appeared in 20th Century Fox&#x27;s &quot;The Egyptian&quot;, a rival production at the time. Several exceptions to this are the casting of John Carradine and Mimi Gibson (in credited supporting roles) and Michael Ansara and Peter Coe (in uncredited minor roles), who appeared in both films.

=== Art direction and costume design ===

Utah-born artist Arnold Friberg designed Moses&#x27; distinctive robe in red with black and white stripes, and the film&#x27;s researchers later discovered that these colors were traditionally associated with the Tribe of Levi. According to Friberg, the costume was woven on an ancient loom using goat&#x27;s hair, although the film&#x27;s publicity stated it was made from jute, wool, and linen fibers. As a gift, after the production, DeMille gave Moses&#x27; robe to Friberg, who had it in his possession until his death in 2010.

Jesse Lasky Jr., a co-writer on &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;, described how DeMille would customarily spread out prints of paintings by Lawrence Alma-Tadema to inform his set designers on the look he wanted to achieve. Arnold Friberg, in addition to designing sets and costumes, also contributed the manner in which Moses ordained Joshua to his mission at the end of the film: by the laying on of hands, placing his hands on Joshua&#x27;s head. Friberg, a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, demonstrated the LDS manner of performing such ordinations, and DeMille liked it.

Sets, costumes and props from the 20th Century Fox production &quot;The Egyptian&quot; (1954) were bought and re-used for &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;—including the &quot;hounds and jackals&quot; game. In March 1954, Walter M. Scott, Fox&#x27;s set decorator, said: &quot;We have made 5,000 different items for the picture. Now the others want to borrow our things. We&#x27;ve already had four men from Cecil B. DeMille over here to see what they can use in &quot;The 10 Commandments&quot;.&quot; As the events in &quot;The Egyptian&quot; take place 70 years before the reign of Rameses II, an unintentional sense of continuity was created.
The gate of Rameses&#x27; city was a replica of the set from DeMille&#x27;s 1923 silent film. Said to be &quot;the biggest film set ever built&quot;, the pylon was 107 feet high and 325 feet long and cost more than $250,000. It included a city wall and an avenue of sphinxes and was constructed in Tanis, Egypt, between Saqqara and the Giza pyramid complex. DeMille also ordered the construction of wooden pyramids that appear to be covered in alabaster; they stood on stilts so they could be seen rising above the horizon. Inside the set were a mess tent, a wardrobe department, and a stable for horses. The Golden Calf prop is also a duplicate from the film, likely on its kneeled position with a few modifications.

The Pharaohs in the film (Rameses I, Sethi, Rameses II) are shown wearing the nemes royal headdress or the red-and-white crown of Upper and Lower Egypt. For his pursuit of the Israelites, Rameses II wears the blue Khepresh helmet-crown, which the pharaohs wore for battle. Paramount&#x27;s makeup department made a plaster cast of Yul Brynner&#x27;s head so his helmet could fit perfectly.

An Egyptian wall painting was also the source for the lively dance performed by a circle of young women at Seti&#x27;s birthday gala. Their movements and costumes are based on art from the Tomb of the Sixth Dynasty Grand Vizier Mehu.

Some of the film&#x27;s cast members, such as Paget, Derek, Foch, and Eduard Franz, wore brown contact lenses, at the behest of DeMille, in order to conceal their light-colored eyes which were considered inadequate for their roles. Paget once said that, &quot;If it hadn&#x27;t been for the lenses I wouldn&#x27;t have got the part.&quot; However, she also said that the lenses were &quot;awful to work in because the Klieg lights heat them up&quot;. When DeMille cast Yvonne De Carlo as Sephora, she was worried about having to wear these contact lenses; she also believed that her gray eyes were her best feature. She asked DeMille to make an exception for her. He agreed, expressing the idea that De Carlo&#x27;s role was special, and that Moses was to fall in love with her.

=== Special effects ===

The special photographic effects in &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; were created by John P. Fulton, A.S.C. (who received an Oscar for his effects in the film), head of the special effects department at Paramount Pictures, assisted by Paul Lerpae, A.S.C. in optical photography (blue screen &quot;travelling matte&quot; composites) and Farciot Edouart, A.S.C., in process photography (rear projection effects). Fulton&#x27;s effects included the building of Seti&#x27;s Jubilee treasure city, the Burning Bush, the fiery hail from a cloudless sky, the Angel of Death, the composites of the Exodus, the Pillar of Fire, the giving of the Ten Commandments, and the tour de force, the parting of the Red Sea.

The parting of the Red Sea was considered the most difficult special effect ever performed up to that time. This effect took about six months of VistaVision filming, and combined scenes shot on the shores of the Red Sea in Egypt, with scenes filmed at Paramount Studios in Hollywood of a huge water tank split by a U-shaped trough, into which approximately 360,000 gallons of water were released from the sides, as well as the filming of a giant waterfall also built on the Paramount backlot to create the effect of the walls of the parted sea out of the turbulent backwash. All of the multiple elements of the shot were then combined in Paul Lerpae&#x27;s optical printer, and matte paintings of rocks by Jan Domela concealed the matte lines between the real elements and the special effects elements. The parting of the Red Sea sequence is considered by many to be one of the greatest special effects of all time.

Unlike the technique used by ILM for &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; and &quot;&quot;Poltergeist&quot;&quot; of injecting poster paints into a glass tank containing a salt water inversion layer, the cloud effects for &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; were formed with white Britt smoke filmed against a translucent sky backing, and colors were added optically. Striking portraits of Charlton Heston as Moses and three women in front of menacing clouds were photographed by Wallace Kelly, A.S.C. in Farciot Edouart&#x27;s process (rear projection) department, in what are still considered unforgettable scenes. DeMille used these scenes to break up the montage, framing his subjects like a Renaissance master.

DeMille was reluctant to discuss technical details of how the film was made, especially the optical tricks used in the parting of the Red Sea. It was eventually revealed that footage of the Red Sea was spliced with film footage (run in reverse) of water pouring from large U-shaped trip-tanks set up in the studio backlot.

The voice of God in the burning bush scene was provided by Charlton Heston, but the voice of God in the tablet-giving scene was provided by a voice actor with a deep bass voice, Jesse Delos Jewkes, who was a member of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. Additionally, Jewkes&#x27; voice was enhanced by the use of the vox humana stop of the Salt Lake Tabernacle organ. De Mille, who was good friends with LDS church president David O. McKay, asked for and received permission to record the organ from McKay.

=== Music ===
The score for &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; was composed and conducted by Elmer Bernstein. Initially, DeMille hired Bernstein, then a relatively unknown film composer, to write and record only the diegetic music required for the film&#x27;s dance sequences and other onscreen musical passages, with the intention of employing frequent collaborator Victor Young to write the score proper. However, Young turned down the assignment due to his own failing health, causing DeMille to hire Bernstein to write the underscore as well.

In total, Bernstein composed 2½ hours of music for the film, writing for a full symphony orchestra augmented with various ethnic and unusual instruments such as the shofar, the tiple, and the theremin. The score is written in a highly Romantic style, featuring unique musical leitmotifs for the film&#x27;s characters (God, Moses, Rameses, Nefretiri, Dathan, Sephora, Lilia, Joshua, et. al) used in a manner inspired, at DeMille&#x27;s direction, by the opera scores of Richard Wagner. Bernstein recorded both the diegetic music and the score at the Paramount Studios Recording Stage in sessions spread from April 1955 to August 1956.

A double-LP monaural soundtrack album was released in 1957 by Dot Records, utilizing excerpts from the original film recordings. A stereo version of the 1957 album was released in 1960 containing new recordings conducted by Bernstein, as the original film recordings, while recorded in three-channel stereo, were not properly balanced for an LP stereo release, as the intent at the time of recording had been to mix the film masters to mono for the film soundtrack itself; this recording was later issued on CD by MCA Classics in 1989. For the film&#x27;s tenth anniversary, United Artists Records released a second stereo re-recording in 1966, also conducted by Bernstein and employing different orchestral arrangements unique to this release.

For the film&#x27;s 60th anniversary in 2016, Intrada Records released a six-CD album of the score. The Intrada release contains the complete 2½ hour score as originally recorded by Bernstein, with much of it remixed in true stereo for the first time. In addition, the 2016 release contains all the diegetic music recorded for the film, the original 1957 Dot album (in mono), the 1960 Dot album (in stereo), and the 1966 United Artists album, as well as a 12-minute recording of Bernstein auditioning his thematic ideas for DeMille on the piano. The box set won the IFMCA Award for Best New Archival Release – Re-Release or Re-Recording of an Existing Score.

== Release ==
Cecil B. DeMille promoted the film by placing Ten Commandment monuments as a publicity stunt for the film in cities across the United States. &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; premiered at New York City&#x27;s Criterion Theatre on November 8, 1956. Among those who attended the premiere were Cecil B. DeMille and his eldest child, Cecilia DeMille Harper; Charlton Heston and his wife, Lydia Clarke; Yul Brynner; Anne Baxter; Edward G. Robinson; Yvonne De Carlo and her husband, Bob Morgan; Martha Scott and her husband, Mel Powell, and son, Carleton Alsop; William Holden and his wife, Brenda Marshall; John Wayne and his wife, Pilar Pallete; Tony Curtis and his wife, Janet Leigh; and Paramount Pictures president Barney Balaban. It played on a roadshow basis with reserved seating until mid-1958, when it finally entered general release.

&quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; was re-released in 1966 and 1972, and one more time in 1989. The 1972 and 1989 re-issues included 70mm and 35mm prints that reframed the picture&#x27;s aspect ratio to 2.20:1 and 2.39:1, respectively, cropping the top and bottom of the picture&#x27;s original 1.85:1 aspect ratio. &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; was released on DVD on March 30, 1999; March 9, 2004, as a Special Collector&#x27;s Edition; and March 29, 2011, as a Special edition and Standard edition. &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; received a 4K UHD Blu-ray release on March 30, 2021.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; was the highest-grossing film of 1956, and the second most successful film of the decade. By April 1957, the film had earned an unprecedented $10 million from engagements at just eighty theaters, averaging about $1 million per week, with more than seven million people paying to watch it. It played for 70 weeks at the Criterion Theatre in New York, grossing $2.7 million. During its initial release, it earned theater rentals (the distributor&#x27;s share of the box office gross) of $31.3 million in North America, and $23.9 million from the foreign markets, for a total of $55.2 million (equating to approximately $122.7 million in ticket sales). It was hugely profitable for its era, earning a net profit of $18,500,000, against a production budget of $13.27 million (the most a film had cost up to that point).

By the time of its withdrawal from distribution at the end of 1960, &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; had overtaken &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; at the box office in the North American territory, and mounted a serious challenge in the global market—the worldwide takings for &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; were reported to stand at $59 million at the time. &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; would be re-released the following year as part of the American Civil War Centennial, and re-asserted its supremacy at the box office by reclaiming the US record. Also at this time, &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;—another biblical epic starring Charlton Heston, released at the end of 1959—would go on to eclipse &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; at the box office. A 1966 re-issue earned $6 million, and further re-releases brought the total American theater rentals to $43 million, equivalent to gross ticket sales of $89 million at the box office. Globally, it ultimately collected $90,066,230 in revenues up to 1979.

It remains one of the most popular films ever made. Adjusted for inflation, it has earned a box office gross equivalent to $2 billion at 2011 prices, according to &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;; only &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939), &quot;Avatar&quot; (2009), &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977), &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997), &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1965), and &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982) have generated higher grosses in constant dollars. &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; is estimated to have sold 262million tickets at the worldwide box office.

=== Critical response ===
&quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; received generally positive reviews after its release, although some reviewers noted its divergence from the biblical text. Bosley Crowther for &quot;The New York Times&quot; was among those who lauded DeMille&#x27;s work, acknowledging that &quot;in its remarkable settings and décor, including an overwhelming facade of the Egyptian city from which the Exodus begins, and in the glowing Technicolor in which the picture is filmed—Mr. DeMille has worked photographic wonders&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; described the &quot;scenes of the greatness that was Egypt, and Hebrews by the thousands under the whip of the taskmasters&quot; as &quot;striking&quot;, and believed that the film &quot;hits the peak of beauty with a sequence that is unelaborate, this being the Passover supper wherein Moses is shown with his family while the shadow of death falls on Egyptian first-borns&quot;.

James Powers of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; declared the film to be &quot;the summit of screen achievement. It is not just a great and powerful motion picture, although it is that; it is also a new human experience. If there were but one print of this Paramount picture, the place of its showing would be the focus of a world-wide pilgrimage.&quot; Philip K. Scheuer, reviewing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, declared the film served as &quot;almost as a religious experience as it is a theatrical one. C. B. remains, at 75, the ablest living director of spectacle in the grand manner. His production measures up to the best for which his admirers have hoped—and far from the worst that his detractors expected. That old-time religion has a new look.&quot;

The film&#x27;s cast was also complimented. &quot;Variety&quot; called Charlton Heston an &quot;adaptable performer&quot; who, as Moses, reveals &quot;inner glow as he is called by God to remove the chains of slavery that hold his people&quot;. Powers felt that Heston was &quot;splendid, handsome, and princely (and human) in the scenes dealing with him as a young man, and majestic and terrible as his role demands it. He is the great Michelangelo conception of Moses, but rather as the inspiration for the sculptor might have been than as a derivation.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; also considered Yul Brynner to be an &quot;expert&quot; as Rameses, too. Anne Baxter&#x27;s performance as Nefretiri was criticized by &quot;Variety&quot; as leaning &quot;close to old-school siren histrionics&quot;, but Crowther believed that it, along with Brynner&#x27;s, is &quot;unquestionably apt and complementary to a lusty and melodramatic romance&quot;. The performances of Yvonne De Carlo and John Derek were acclaimed by Crowther as &quot;notably good&quot;. He also commended the film&#x27;s &quot;large cast of characters&quot; as &quot;very good, from Sir Cedric Hardwicke as a droll and urbane Pharaoh to Edward G. Robinson as a treacherous overlord&quot;.

Leonard Maltin, a contemporary film critic, gave the film four out of four stars, and described it as &quot;vivid storytelling at its best... Parting of the Red Sea, writing of the holy tablets are unforgettable highlights.&quot; The critic Camille Paglia has called &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; one of the ten greatest films of all time.

Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively collected 45 reviews, and reported that 84% of critics have given the film a positive review, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus states: &quot;Bombastic and occasionally silly, but extravagantly entertaining, Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s all-star spectacular is a muscular retelling of the great Bible story.&quot;

== Popularity and legacy ==
Critics have argued that considerable liberties were taken with the biblical story of Exodus, compromising the film&#x27;s claim to authenticity, but neither this nor its nearly four-hour length has had any effect on its popularity. In fact, many of the supposed inaccuracies were actually adopted by DeMille from extra-biblical ancient sources, such as Josephus, the Sepher ha-Yashar, and the Chronicle of Moses. Moses&#x27; career in Ethiopia, for instance, is based on the Midrash, the original layer of the Talmud. For decades, a showing of &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; was a popular fundraiser among revivalist Christian Churches, while the film was equally treasured by film buffs for DeMille&#x27;s &quot;cast of thousands&quot; approach and the heroic acting.

Martin Scorsese later said it was one of his favorite films, writing in 1978 that:
I like De Mille: his theatricality, his images. I&#x27;ve seen &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; maybe forty or fifty times. Forget the story - you&#x27;ve got to - and concentrate on the special effects, and the texture, and the color. For example: The figure of God, killing the first-born child, is a green smoke; then on the terrace, while they&#x27;re talking, a green dry ice just touches the heel of George Reeves or somebody, and he dies. Then there&#x27;s the reel Red Sea, and the lamb&#x27;s blood of the Passover. De Mille presented a fantasy, dream-like quality on film that was so real, if you saw his movies as a child, they stuck with you for life.

Metallica were inspired to write their tenth plague of Egypt inspired smash hit &quot;Creeping Death&quot; after watching the second half of the movie. While watching the scene of the final plague killing every Egyptian first-born child, bassist-at-the-time Cliff Burton remarked, &quot;Whoa – it&#x27;s like creeping death,&quot; as the plague was represented by a fog rolling into the Pharaoh&#x27;s palace in the movie. The band liked the sound of &quot;creeping death&quot; and decided to write a song about the plagues, using the phrase as its title. The song&#x27;s chorus also makes use of the famous &quot;So let it be written, so let it be done&quot; line.

== Home media ==
&quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; has been released on DVD in the United States on four occasions: the first edition (Widescreen Collection) was released on March 30, 1999, as a two-disc set, the second edition (Special Collector&#x27;s Edition) was released on March 9, 2004, as a two-disc set with commentary by Katherine Orrison, the third edition (50th Anniversary Collection) was released on March 21, 2006, as a three-disc set with the 1923 version and special features, and the fourth edition (55th Anniversary Edition) was released on DVD again in a two-disc set on March 29, 2011, and for the first time on Blu-ray in a two-disc set and a six-disc limited edition gift set with the 1923 version and DVD copies. In 2012, the limited edition gift set won the Home Media Award for Best Packaging (Paramount Pictures and Johns Byrne). In March 2021, a UHD Blu-ray was released. Using the 2010 6K scans, Paramount spent over 150 hours on new color work and clean-up.

== Television broadcast ==
&quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; was first broadcast on the ABC network on February 18, 1973, and has aired annually on the network since then, with the exception of 1999, traditionally during the Passover and Easter holidays. Since 2006, the network has typically aired &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; on the Saturday night prior to Easter, with the broadcast starting at 7:00 p.m. in the Eastern, Pacific and Hawaii Time Zones and 6:00 p.m. in the Central, Mountain and Alaska Time Zones. (Exceptions occurred in 2020 when the film aired prior to Palm Sunday, which that year was April 4, due to the COVID-19 pandemic; in 2022, when the film aired on April 9, the Saturday before Palm Sunday, due to an NBA game telecast scheduled on the night before Easter the following week; and in 2023, when the film aired on April 1, the Saturday before Palm Sunday, due to an NHL game telecast scheduled on the night before Easter the following week.) The film is one of only two pre-scheduled &quot;ABC Saturday Movies of the Week&quot; every year, the other being &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;.

Unlike many lengthy films of the day, which were usually broken up into separate airings over at least two nights, ABC elected to show &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; in one night and has done so every year it has carried the film, with one exception; in 1997, ABC elected to split the movie in two and aired half of it in its normal Easter Sunday slot, which that year was March 30, with the second half airing on Monday, March 31 as counterprogramming to the other networks&#x27; offerings, which included CBS&#x27; coverage of the NCAA Men&#x27;s Basketball Championship Game.

The length of the film combined with the necessary advertisement breaks has caused its broadcast window to vary over the years; by 2023, ABC&#x27;s total run time for &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; stood at four hours and 44 minutes, just above one hour longer than its three-hour and 39-minute length. This requires the network to overrun into the 11:00 p.m./10:00 p.m. timeslot that belongs to the local affiliates, thus delaying their late local news and any other programming they may air in the overnight hours. Affiliates may also delay the film to the usual start of prime time at 8:00 p.m./7:00 p.m. to keep their schedules in line for early evening, at the cost of further delaying their local newscasts or forgoing them entirely.

In 2010, the film was broadcast in high definition for the first time, which allowed the television audience to see it in its original 1.66:1 VistaVision aspect ratio. It is also broadcast with its original Spanish language dub over the second audio program channel. In 2015, for the first time in several years, the network undertook a one-off airing of the film on Easter Sunday night, which fell on April 5.

All of ABC&#x27;s telecasts omit Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s opening prologue and some musical elements (Overture, Entr&#x27;acte, and Exit Music) seen in the theatrical release.

In the Philippines, the film is traditionally aired every Holy Week (yearly except 2019) since it premiered on April 1, 2015, on GMA Network, either cut for time or in full, and dubbed in Filipino.

<text>Tevye the Dairyman, also translated as Tevye the Milkman (, &quot;Tevye der milkhiker&quot; ) is the fictional narrator and protagonist of a series of short stories by Sholem Aleichem, and their various adaptations, the most famous being the musical &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;, which premiered on Broadway in 1964, and its 1971 film adaptation. Tevye is a pious Jewish dairyman living in the Russian Empire, the patriarch of a family including several troublesome daughters. The village of Boyberik, where the stories are set (renamed Anatevka in &quot;Fiddler on the Roof),&quot; is based on the town of Boyarka, Ukraine, then part of the Russian Empire. Boyberik is a suburb of Yehupetz (based on Kyiv), where most of Tevye&#x27;s customers live.

The stories were written in Yiddish and first published in 1894; they have been published as &quot;Tevye and His Daughters&quot;, &quot;Tevye&#x27;s Daughters&quot;, &quot;Tevye the Milkman&quot;, and &quot;Tevye the Dairyman&quot;.

As Tevye &quot;tells&quot; Aleichem the tales of his family life, six of his seven daughters (Tzeitel, Chava, Hodel, Shprintze, Taybele, and Bielke) are named, and of these five play leading roles in Tevye&#x27;s stories. The stories tell of his business dealings, the romantic dealings and marriages of several of his daughters, and the expulsion of the Jews from their village by the Russian government.

The Tevye stories have been adapted for stage and film several times. Sholem Aleichem&#x27;s own Yiddish stage adaptation was not produced during his lifetime; its first production, by Maurice Schwartz, was in 1919. (Schwartz did a film based on the play twenty years later.) The Broadway musical &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; was based on a play written by Arnold Perl called &quot;Tevye and His Daughters&quot;. &quot;Tevye the Dairyman&quot; has had four film adaptations: in Yiddish (1939), Hebrew (1968), English (1971) and Russian (2017).

== Name ==
The name &quot;Tevye&quot; is the Yiddish derivative of the Hebrew name טוביה, &quot;Tuvya&quot; (i.e., Tobias).. In Hebrew, the character is known as טוביה החולב, &quot;Tuvya ha-cholev&quot;, , &#x27;Tobias the dairyman&#x27;.. Tevye&#x27;s full name, with its Yiddish patronymic, is Tevye ben Shneur Zalman.

==Stories==
&quot;Tevye the Dairyman&quot; comprises eight stories, with Tevye each time supposedly meeting Sholom Aleichem by chance and relating the latest tale of his trials and tribulations. They have been published in translation under the following titles:
# &quot;Tevye Strikes It Rich&quot; (also translated as &quot;Tevye Wins a Fortune&quot; or &quot;The Great Windfall&quot;)
# &quot;Tevye Blows A Small Fortune&quot; (also translated as &quot;The Roof Falls In&quot; or &quot;The Bubble Bursts&quot;)
# &quot;Today&#x27;s Children&quot; (also translated as &quot;Modern Children&quot;)
# &quot;Hodel&quot;
# &quot;Chava&quot;
# &quot;Shprintze&quot;
# &quot;Tevye Leaves for the Land of Israel&quot; (also translated as &quot;Tevye Goes to Palestine&quot; or &quot;Tevye is Going to Eretz Yisroel&quot;)
# &quot;Lekh-Lekho&quot; (also translated as &quot;Get Thee Out&quot;)

Not all the events of the stories are depicted in &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;, the best-known adaptation. For instance, by the time of the events of &quot;Lekh-Lekho&quot;, Tevye&#x27;s wife Golde, his daughter Shprintze, and his son-in-law Motl have all died; also in &quot;Lekh-Lekho&quot;, upon learning of the Jews&#x27; expulsion, Chava leaves her Russian Orthodox husband, wanting to return to her family and share their exile. Aleichem leaves it to the reader to decide whether or not Tevye forgives her and takes her back, saying:
and ending the story with &quot;The old God of Israel still lives!&quot;

A 2009 translation includes a final short story titled &quot;Vachalaklokos&quot; that takes place after &quot;Lekh-Lekho&quot;.

Other translations include:
* ; for many years, this translation seems to have been the standard published version.

The story &quot;Tevye Strikes It Rich&quot; was adapted for children by Gabriel Lisowski in 1976 and published under the title &quot;How Tevye Became a Milkman&quot;.

===Audio adaptations===
The Tevye stories have been recorded and commercially released twice:
* , with six of the stories: &quot;Tevye Strikes It Rich&quot;, &quot;Tevye Blows a Small Fortune&quot;, &quot;Today&#x27;s Children&quot;, &quot;Hodl&quot;, &quot;Chava&quot; and &quot;Lekh-Lekho&quot;.

An audio production of Arnold Perl&#x27;s play &quot;Tevya and His Daughters&quot; was released by Columbia Masterworks in 1957 (OL 5225); the cast included Mike Kellin as Tevya, Anna Vita Berger as Golde/The Rich Woman, Joan Harvey as Tzeitl, Carroll Conroy as Hodl, and Howard Da Silva (who also directed the production) as Lazar Wolf/The Rich Merchant/The Rabbi.

The NPR/Yiddish Book Center 13-part mid-1990s radio series &quot;Great Jewish Stories from Eastern Europe and Beyond&quot;, hosted by Leonard Nimoy, broadcast a reading of the story &quot;Chava&quot; performed by Walter Matthau.

== Portrayals ==
Zero Mostel and Chaim Topol are the two actors most associated with the role of Tevye, although Theodore Bikel performed it many times on stage. For the film version of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;, the part ultimately went to Topol, as producer-director Norman Jewison felt that Mostel&#x27;s portrayal was too unnecessarily comic. Topol was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance in the film version of &quot;Fiddler&quot;. He also portrayed the character nearly 3,500 times on stage, retiring the role in 2009.

Other noteworthy musical Tevyes have included Luther Adler, Herschel Bernardi, Paul Lipson (original Broadway run, over 2,000 performances), Leonard Nimoy (1971 touring company), Shmuel Rodensky (original Israeli, Yiddish and German productions), Alfred Molina and Harvey Fierstein (2004 Broadway revival), Henry Goodman (2007 London revival), Danny Burstein (2015 Broadway revival), Yehezkel Lazarov (2018 touring company) and Steven Skybell (2018 Off-Broadway revival in Yiddish). Paul Michael Glaser, who played Perchik in the 1971 film version, played Tevye in a 2013–14 touring production in the United Kingdom.

&quot;Tevya&quot; is the name of a 1939 film adaptation of the story, performed entirely in Yiddish. In this adaptation, Tevye, played by Maurice Schwartz, is portrayed as gruff with flashes of wit and humor.

Prior to the 1964 Broadway debut of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;, adaptations of the Tevye stories appeared on stage and screen, in America and beyond. The earliest screen version was an American silent film called &quot;Broken Barriers&quot;, based on Aleichem&#x27;s own theatrical treatment and released in 1919 (just a few years after Aleichem died). In 1962, Gerhard Klingenberg directed the television film &quot;Tevya und seine Töchter&quot;. After &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; became a Broadway sensation, an Israeli film called &quot;Tuvia Vesheva Benotav&quot; (&quot;Tevye and His Seven Daughters&quot;) starring Shmuel Rodensky was released in 1968, as well as two Russian versions: &quot;Teve-molochnik&quot; (&quot;Tevye the Milkman&quot;) in 1985 and &quot;Myr vashomu domu!&quot; (&quot;Tevye&#x27;s Daughters&quot;) in 2017.

In 2018, Jerusalem Ballet published a ballet adaptation based on both &quot;Tevye the Dairyman&quot; and &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;, by Russian ballet dancer-choreographer Igor Menshikov. Tevye has been portrayed by Israeli ballet dancer Meitar Basson.

<doc id="76385" wikidata="Q1192927" url="?curid=76385" title="The Thief of Bagdad (1924 film)">
<text>The Thief of Bagdad is a 1924 American silent adventure film directed by Raoul Walsh and starring Douglas Fairbanks, and written by Achmed Abdullah and Lotta Woods. Freely adapted from &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;, it tells the story of a thief who falls in love with the daughter of the Caliph of Baghdad. In 1996, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

Fairbanks considered this to be the favorite of his films, according to his son. The imaginative gymnastics suited the athletic star, whose &quot;catlike, seemingly effortless&quot; movements were as much dance as gymnastics. Along with his earlier &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot; (1920) and &quot;Robin Hood&quot; (1922), the film marked Fairbanks&#x27;s transformation from genial comedy to a career in &quot;swashbuckling&quot; roles. The film, strong on special effects (flying carpet, magic rope and fearsome monsters) and featuring massive Arabian-style sets, also proved to be a stepping stone for Anna May Wong, who portrayed a treacherous Mongol slave.

&quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot; is now widely considered one of the great silent films and Fairbanks&#x27;s greatest work. Fairbanks biographer Jeffrey Vance writes, &quot;An epic romantic fantasy-adventure inspired by several of the Arabian Nights tales, &quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot; is the greatest artistic triumph of Fairbanks&#x27;s career. The superb visual design, spectacle, imaginative splendor, and visual effects, along with his bravura performance (leading a cast of literally thousands), all contribute to making this his masterpiece.&quot;

The film was remade several times; the 1940 Technicolor version splits the main character into two: a deposed prince and a thief, the latter played by Sabu.

==Plot==

Ahmed steals as he pleases in the city of Bagdad. Wandering into a mosque, he tells the holy man he disdains his religion; his philosophy is, &quot;What I want, I take.&quot;

That night, he sneaks into the palace of the caliph using a magic rope he stole during ritual prayers. All thoughts of plunder are forgotten when he sees the sleeping princess, the caliph&#x27;s daughter. The princess&#x27;s Mongol slave alerts the guards, but he gets away.

When his associate Abu reminds the disconsolate Ahmed that a bygone thief once stole another princess during the reign of Haroun al-Rashid, Ahmed sets out to do the same. The next day is the princess&#x27;s birthday. Three princes arrive, seeking her hand in marriage (and the future inheritance of the city). Another of the princess&#x27;s slaves foretells that she will marry the man who first touches a rose-tree in her garden. The princess watches anxiously as first the glowering Prince of the Indies, then the obese Prince of Persia and finally the Prince of the Mongols pass by the rose-tree. The mere sight of the Mongol fills the princess with fear, but when Ahmed appears (disguised in stolen garments as a suitor), she is delighted. The Mongol slave tells her countryman of the prophecy, but before he can touch the rose-tree, Ahmed&#x27;s startled horse tosses its rider into it.

That night, following ancient custom, the princess chooses Ahmed for her husband. Out of love, Ahmed gives up his plan to abduct her and confesses all to her in private. The Mongol prince learns from his spy, the princess&#x27;s Mongol slave, that Ahmed is a common thief and informs the caliph. Ahmed is lashed mercilessly, and the caliph orders he be torn apart by a giant ape, but the princess has the guards bribed to let him go.

When the caliph insists she select another husband, her loyal slave advises her to delay. She asks that the princes each bring her a gift after &quot;seven moons&quot;; she will marry the one who brings her the rarest. In despair, Ahmed turns to the holy man. He tells the thief to become a prince, revealing to him the peril-fraught path to a great treasure.

The Prince of the Indies obtains a magic crystal ball from the eye of a giant idol, which shows whatever he wants to see, while the Persian prince buys a flying carpet. The Mongol prince leaves behind his henchman, telling him to organize the soldiers he will send to Bagdad disguised as porters. (The potentate has sought all along to take the city; the beautiful princess is only an added incentive.) After he lays his hands on a magic golden apple which has the power to cure anything, even death, he sends word to the Mongol slave to poison the princess. After many adventures, Ahmed gains a cloak of invisibility and a small chest of magic powder which turns into whatever he wishes when he sprinkles it. He races back to the city.

The three princes meet as agreed at a caravanserai before returning to Bagdad. The Mongol asks the Indian to check whether the princess has waited for them. They discover that she is near death, and ride the flying carpet to reach her. Then the Mongol uses the apple to cure her. The suitors argue over which gift is rarest, but the princess points out that without any one gift, the remaining two would have been useless in saving her. Her loyal slave shows her Ahmed in the crystal ball, so the princess convinces her father to deliberate carefully on his future son-in-law. The Mongol prince chooses not to wait, unleashing his secret army that night and capturing Bagdad.

Ahmed arrives at the city gate, shut and defended by Mongols. When he conjures up a large army with his powder, the Mongol soldiers flee. The Mongol prince is about to have one of his soldiers kill him when the Mongol slave suggests he escape with the princess on the flying carpet. Ahmed liberates the city and rescues the princess, using his cloak of invisibility to get through the Mongols guarding their prince. In gratitude, the caliph gives his daughter to him in marriage.

==Production==

Fairbanks sought to make an epic. Lavishly staged on a Hollywood studio set, at a reputed cost of $1,135,654.65, &quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot; was one of the most expensive films of the 1920s. Art director William Cameron Menzies was largely responsible for the production design, closely following the requirements laid down by Fairbanks, who acted as writer, producer and star. Fairbanks&#x27; meticulous attention to detail, as well as complex visual imagery, required the use of state-of-the-art special effects, featuring a magic rope, a flying horse, a flying carpet and full-scale palace sets.

==Music==
Douglas Fairbanks encouraged the respected composer Mortimer Wilson to provide a fully-fledged classical score. Wilson composed leit-motifs for each character and developed them symphonically. He also spent many hours in the editing room working on combining his music with the film. The score has been re-constructed by Mark Fitz-Gerald and recorded. A 1924 Literary Digest article details Wilson&#x27;s work on the film (and includes a photo of the composer). Wilson also wrote the music for Fairbanks&#x27;s next two films, &quot;Don Q, Son of Zorro&quot; (1925) and &quot;The Black Pirate&quot; (1926).

==Reception==
Glenn Erickson praised the film, writing:

Every age has its wonder entertainments, and 1924&#x27;s The Thief of Bagdad transported audiences to a new level of imaginative fantasy. It had the biggest star of the era in a production that dwarfed anything anyone had ever seen ... It has sets bigger than those in Intolerance and costumed crowd scenes to rival the enormous Italian spectacles of the day. What&#x27;s more, the picture is packed with elaborate special effects, many of which still have the power to impress. ... Some critics prefer Douglas Fairbanks&#x27; earlier modern-day adventures to his twenties&#x27; costume epics, but this dazzler still takes people&#x27;s heads off. Simply put, the production&#x27;s overall design and execution -- sets, costumes, lighting, special effects -- are coordinated so tightly that the illusion of grandeur is complete.
Darragh O&#x27;Donoghue is of the opinion that:

&quot;The first reel provides some of the purest joy the silent cinema can offer. ... Where initially there had been a satisfying equivalence between the discrete adventures of Ahmed as a psychologically plausible thief in medieval Mesopotamia and Ahmed as a universal Everyman figure, in the film&#x27;s latter two-thirds, the former distinctive superstructure gives way to a kind of Pilgrim’s Progress in Orientalist drag. ... Adventure sequences are staged like fairground tableaux and have none of the interest in physical process or emotional investment that made the early reels so exciting. ... After promising a dream, this great but flawed film eventually sends its audience to sleep.
The film along with &quot;The Sheik&quot; (1921) was adapted into a broadway by Dardanella which was performed on October 12, 1928, in Surabaya, and starred Indonesian actor Tan Tjeng Bok which later earned him the nickname &quot;Douglas Fairbanks of Java&quot;. Future American dancer, Devi Dja, also appeared in the broadway by working behind the stage.

==Honors==
In June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its &quot;10 Top 10&quot;, the 10 best films in 10 &quot;classic&quot; American film genres. After polling over 1,500 people from the creative community, &quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot; was acknowledged as the ninth best film in the fantasy genre.

==Preservation status==
The George Eastman Museum has a 16mm triacetate positive print.

==Remakes==
The 1940 film of the same name made the title character, played by Sabu, a sidekick for a handsome prince rather than the leading man. Indian actor M. G. Ramachandran assumed the role of Ali, the thief of Baghdad in the 1960 film &quot;Baghdad Thirudan&quot;. The 1924 film was directly remade in Europe in 1961 as &quot;Il Ladro di Bagdad&quot;, with Steve Reeves in the lead, while a 1978 made-for-television film combined plot elements of these with others from the Sabu version.

A number of Indian films, were made under the titles of: &quot;Baghdad Ka Chor&quot; (&quot;The Thief of Baghdad&quot;) in 1934, 1946, 1955; &quot;Baghdad Gaja Donga&quot; (&quot;Thief of Baghdad&quot;) in 1968; and &quot;Thief of Baghdad&quot; in 1969 and 1977. A television series, &quot;Thief of Baghdad&quot;, was also made in India which aired on Zee TV between 2000 and 2001.

==Home media==
&quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot; is in the public domain and many cheap, unrestored black-and-white copies have been issued on VHS and DVD. A restored version first appeared on US DVD in 1998, distributed by Image Entertainment. It featured original color tinting and a musical accompaniment arranged from the original 1924 music cue sheets and performed in 1975 by Gaylord Carter on a Wurlitzer theater pipe organ. Kino International reissued the DVD in 2004, this time with a longer, improved print and chamber ensemble score. The film has also been released on Blu-ray by the Cohen Film Collection (US) in 2013 and Eureka! Entertainment (UK) in 2014. That version features a Carl Davis orchestral score and an audio commentary by Fairbanks biographer Jeffrey Vance.

<text>The Thing from Another World, sometimes referred to as just The Thing, is a 1951 American black-and-white science fiction-horror film directed by Christian Nyby, produced by Edward Lasker for Howard Hawks&#x27; Winchester Pictures Corporation, and released by RKO Radio Pictures. The film stars Margaret Sheridan, Kenneth Tobey, Robert Cornthwaite, and Douglas Spencer. James Arness plays The Thing. &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot; is based on the 1938 novella &quot;Who Goes There?&quot; by John W. Campbell (writing under the pseudonym of Don A. Stuart).

The film&#x27;s storyline concerns a United States Air Force crew and scientists who find a crashed flying saucer frozen in the Arctic ice and a humanoid body nearby. Returning to their remote arctic research outpost with the body still in a block of ice, they are forced to defend themselves against the still alive and malevolent plant-based alien when it is accidentally thawed out.
==Plot==

In Anchorage, journalist Ned Scott, looking for a story, visits the officer&#x27;s club of the Alaskan Air Command, where he meets Captain Pat Hendry, his co-pilot and flight navigator. General Fogarty orders Hendry to fly to Polar Expedition Six at the North Pole, per a request from its lead scientist, Nobel laureate Dr. Arthur Carrington; Carrington has radioed that an unusual aircraft has crashed nearby. With Scott, Corporal Barnes, crew chief Bob, and a pack of sled dogs, Hendry pilots a Douglas C-47 Skytrain transport aircraft to the remote outpost.

Upon arrival, Scott and the airmen meet radio operator Tex, scientists Dr. Chapman and his wife, and colleagues Vorhees, Stern, Redding, Stone, Laurence, Wilson, Ambrose, and Carrington. Hendry later rekindles his romance with Nikki Nicholson, Carrington&#x27;s secretary. Several scientists fly with the airmen to the crash site, finding a large object buried beneath the ice. As they spread out to determine the object&#x27;s shape, they realize that they are standing in a circle, outlining a flying saucer. The team attempts to free it from the ice with thermite, but a violent reaction with the craft&#x27;s metal alloy completely destroys it. Their Geiger counter, however, detects something buried nearby, a frozen body. It is excavated intact in a large block of ice and flown back to the base as an Arctic storm closes in on them.

Given the discovery, Hendry assumes command of the outpost and, pending radio instructions from General Fogarty, denies Scott permission to send out his story and refuses the scientists&#x27; demands to examine the body. Tex sends an update to Fogarty, and the airmen settle for the storm. A watch is posted; relieving the first shift, Barnes is disturbed by the creature&#x27;s glare through the clearing ice and covers it with an electric blanket he does not realize is plugged in. The block slowly thaws and the creature, still alive, escapes into the storm. It fights with the sled dogs and kills two, but loses most of its right forearm.

An airman recovers the stump after the attack and the scientists examine its tissue, concluding that the creature is an advanced form of plant life. Carrington is convinced of its superiority to humans and becomes intent on communicating with it. The airmen begin a search, which leads to the outpost&#x27;s greenhouse. Carrington stays behind with other scientists, having noticed evidence of alien activity there. They discover a hidden third sled dog, which had been bled dry, revealing the creature as a vampire that feeds on blood. Carrington and the scientists post a secret watch of their own, hoping to encounter it before the airmen do.

The next morning, the airmen continue their search. Tex informs them that Fogarty is aware of their discovery and demands further information, now prevented by the fierce storm. Stern appears, badly injured, and tells the group that the creature has killed and bled two scientists. When the airmen investigate, they are attacked, but manage to barricade the creature inside the greenhouse. Hendry confronts Carrington and orders him to remain in his lab and quarters.

Carrington, obsessed with the creature, shows Nicholson and the other scientists that he has been growing small alien plants from seeds taken from the severed arm and feeding them with the base’s blood plasma supply. Hendry discovers the theft when plasma is needed to treat Stern, which leads him to Carrington. Fogarty transmits orders to keep the creature alive, but it escapes from the greenhouse and attacks the airmen in their quarters. They douse it with buckets of kerosene and set it aflame, forcing it to retreat into the storm. After regrouping, they realize the creature has sabotaged the base furnaces’ oil supply, plummeting temperatures indoors. They retreat to the station&#x27;s generator room to keep warm, and rig a high-voltage electrical &quot;fly trap&quot;. The creature continues to stalk them. At the last moment Carrington pleads with it, but is knocked violently aside. The creature walks into the trap and is electrocuted. On Hendry&#x27;s order, it is reduced to a pile of ash.

When the weather clears, Hendry and Nicholson are careening toward marriage, and Scotty is finally able to radio his &quot;story of a lifetime&quot; to a roomful of reporters in Anchorage. He ends his broadcast with the warning: &quot;Tell the world. Tell this to everybody, wherever they are. Watch the skies everywhere. Keep looking. Keep watching the skies...&quot;.

==Cast==
==Production==
In 1950, Lederer and Hecht convinced Hawks to buy the rights to &quot;Who Goes There?&quot;, who did so for $1,250.

In an unusual practice for the era, no actors are named during the film&#x27;s dramatic &quot;slow burning letters through background&quot; opening title sequence; the cast credits appear at the end of the film. Appearing in a small role was George Fenneman, who at the time was gaining fame as Groucho Marx&#x27;s announcer on the popular quiz show &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;. Fenneman later said he had difficulty with the overlapping dialogue in the film.

The film was partly shot in Glacier National Park with interior sets built at a Los Angeles ice storage plant.

The scene where the alien is set aflame and repeatedly doused with kerosene was one of the first full-body fire stunts ever filmed.

===Screenplay===
The film was loosely adapted by Charles Lederer, with uncredited rewrites from Howard Hawks and Ben Hecht, from the 1938 novella &quot;Who Goes There?&quot; by John W. Campbell. The story was first published in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; under Campbell&#x27;s pseudonym, Don A. Stuart. (Campbell had just become &quot;Astounding&quot;″s managing editor when his novella appeared in its pages.) Science fiction author A. E. van Vogt, who had been inspired to write from reading &quot;Who Goes There?&quot; and who had been a prolific contributor to &quot;Astounding&quot;, had wanted to write the script.

The screenplay changes the fundamental nature of the alien from Campbell&#x27;s novella as a life form capable of assuming the physical and mental characteristics of any living thing it encounters (as realized in John Carpenter&#x27;s 1982 adaptation of the original source, &quot;The Thing&quot;.) into a humanoid life form whose cellular structure is closer to vegetation, although it must feed on blood to survive. The internal, plant-like structure of the creature makes it impervious to bullets, but not to other destructive forces such as fire and electricity.

Film critic Bill Warren has argued that the film reflects a post-Hiroshima skepticism about science and prevailing negative views of scientists who meddle with things better left alone. This suspicion of science, though, is also a larger theme in Arctic horror, including &quot;Who Goes There&quot; (1938) the source material for the film, and other notable works like H.P. Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot; (1936), as well as older works of in horror and the Gothic, such as &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1818) and &quot;The Island of Doctor Moreau&quot; (1896).

===Director===
There is debate as to whether the film was directed by Howard Hawks, with Christian Nyby receiving the credit so that Nyby could obtain his Director&#x27;s Guild membership or whether Nyby directed it with considerable input from producer Hawks for Hawks&#x27; Winchester Pictures, which released the film through RKO Radio Pictures Inc. Hawks gave Nyby only $5,460 of RKO&#x27;s $50,000 director&#x27;s fee and kept the rest, but Hawks always denied that he directed the film.

Cast members disagree on Hawks&#x27; and Nyby&#x27;s contributions: Tobey said that &quot;Hawks directed it, all except one scene&quot; while, on the other hand, Fenneman said that &quot;Hawks would once in a while direct, if he had an idea, but it was Chris&#x27; show&quot;. Cornthwaite said that &quot;Chris always deferred to Hawks ... Maybe because he did defer to him, people misinterpreted it.&quot;

One of the film&#x27;s stars, William Self, later became President of 20th Century Fox Television. In describing the production, Self said, &quot;Chris was the director in our eyes, but Howard was the boss in our eyes.&quot; Although Self has said that &quot;Hawks was directing the picture from the sidelines&quot;, he also has said that &quot;Chris would stage each scene, how to play it. But then he would go over to Howard and ask him for advice, which the actors did not hear ... Even though I was there every day, I don&#x27;t think any of us can answer the question. Only Chris and Howard can answer the question.&quot;

At a reunion of &quot;The Thing&quot; cast and crew members in 1982, Nyby said: 

==Reception==
===Critical and box office reception===
&quot;The Thing from Another World&quot; was released in April 1951. By the end of that year, the film had accrued $1,950,000 in distributors&#x27; domestic (U.S. and Canada) rentals, making it the year&#x27;s 46th biggest earner, beating all other science fiction films released that year, including &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; and &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot;.

Bosley Crowther in &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed, &quot;Taking a fantastic notion (or is it, really?), Mr. Hawks has developed a movie that is generous with thrills and chills…Adults and children can have a lot of old-fashioned movie fun at &#x27;The Thing&#x27;, but parents should understand their children and think twice before letting them see this film if their emotions are not properly conditioned&quot;. &quot;Gene&quot; in &quot;Variety&quot; complained that the film &quot;lacks genuine entertainment values&quot;. In 1973, science fiction editor and publisher Lester del Rey compared the film unfavorably to the source material, calling it &quot;just another monster epic, totally lacking in the force and tension of the original story&quot;. Isaac Asimov thought it to be one of the worst movies he had ever seen. For his part, Campbell acknowledged that an adaptation would have to change elements from the original, which he considered too scary for most audience members, and hoped that at least the movie would succeed in getting people interested in science fiction.

The film is now considered to be one of the best films of 1951 and one of the great science fiction films of the 1950s. It garnered an 87% &quot;Fresh&quot; rating at the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes from 68 reviews, with the consensus that the film &quot;is better than most flying saucer movies, thanks to well-drawn characters and concise, tense plotting&quot;. In 2001, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film &quot;culturally significant&quot; and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry. Additionally, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot; &quot;the greatest 1950s sci-fi movie&quot;.

==Related productions==
* In 1972, director Eugenio Martín and producer Bernard Gordon made &quot;Horror Express&quot;, a Spanish-British co-production that serves as a second, looser adaptation of Campbell&#x27;s novella.
* In 1982, John Carpenter adapted the original novella as &quot;The Thing&quot;. In 1980, &quot;Fantasy Newsletter&quot; had reported that Wilbur Stark had bought the rights to several old RKO Pictures fantasy films, intending to remake them, and suggested the most significant of these purchases was &quot;The Thing From Another World&quot;. This soon led to the making of a more faithful, though initially poorly received, adaptation of Campbell&#x27;s story, directed by Carpenter, released in 1982 as &quot;The Thing&quot;, with Stark as executive producer. It paid homage to the 1951 film by using the same &quot;slow burning letters through background&quot; opening title sequence. Carpenter&#x27;s earlier film, &quot;Halloween&quot; (1978), also paid homage when the protagonist is shown watching &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot; on television.
* In 1989, Turner Home Entertainment released a colorized version of the original film on VHS, billed as an &quot;RKO Color Classic&quot;.

<text>To Be or Not to Be is a 1942 American black comedy film, directed by Ernst Lubitsch, starring Carole Lombard and Jack Benny, and featuring Robert Stack, Felix Bressart, Lionel Atwill, Stanley Ridges and Sig Ruman. The plot concerns a troupe of actors in Nazi-occupied Warsaw who use their abilities at disguise and acting to fool the occupying troops.

It was adapted by Lubitsch (uncredited) and Edwin Justus Mayer from the story by Melchior Lengyel. The film was released one month after actress Carole Lombard was killed in an airplane crash. In 1996, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

==Plot==
The well-known stars of a Warsaw theater company, including &quot;&quot; Joseph Tura and wife Maria, are rehearsing &quot;Gestapo&quot;, a satirical play. That night, when the company performs &quot;Hamlet&quot;, with Joseph in the title role, one actor, Bronski, commiserates with colleague Greenberg about always being spear carriers. Greenberg, implied to be Jewish, reveals he has always dreamed of playing Shylock in &quot;The&quot; &quot;Merchant of Venice&quot;.

Maria receives an admiring letter from Lieutenant Stanislav Sobinski; she invites him to visit her in her dressing room that night when Joseph begins his &quot;To be, or not to be&quot; speech. Soon, the government issues orders to cancel &quot;Gestapo&quot; in order to avoid worsening relations with Germany. The following night, Sobinski again walks out during &quot;To be...&quot; to meet Maria, infuriating Joseph. Sobinski confesses his love to Maria, assuming that she&#x27;ll leave her husband, and the stage, to be with him. Before Maria can correct him, news breaks out that Germany has invaded Poland. Sobinski leaves to join the Polish division of the Royal Air Force (RAF), and the actors hide as Warsaw is bombed.

Sobinski and his fellows meet the Polish resistance leader Professor Siletsky. Siletsky will return to Warsaw soon, and the men give him messages for their loved ones. However, Sobinski becomes suspicious when Siletsky does not know of Maria Tura. The Allies realize that Siletsky knows the identity of Polish airmen&#x27;s relatives, against whom reprisals can be taken should he tell the Nazis. Sobinski flies back to warn Maria; however, Siletsky has Maria brought to him by German soldiers and passes on Sobinski&#x27;s message to her. He invites Maria to dinner, hoping to recruit her as a Nazi spy. Just before she arrives home, Joseph returns and finds Sobinski in his bed. Maria and Sobinski try to figure out what to do about Siletsky, while Joseph tries to understand his wife&#x27;s relationship with the pilot. Joseph proclaims he&#x27;ll kill Siletsky.

A company member in Gestapo disguise summons Siletsky to &quot;Gestapo headquarters&quot;, the theatre. Joseph pretends to be Gestapo Colonel Ehrhardt. After giving Joseph the list of Polish resistance fighters&#x27; loved ones, Siletsky becomes suspicious and mentions Sobinski&#x27;s message for Maria and that &quot;To be or not to be&quot; signals their rendezvous. A surprised Joseph uncontrollably reveals himself. Siletsky pulls a gun on him and tries to escape but is shot and killed on the theatre&#x27;s stage by Sobinski. Joseph disguises himself as Siletsky and goes to Siletsky&#x27;s hotel to retrieve an extra copy of Siletsky&#x27;s list. There he finds Maria, who was unable to leave without Siletsky&#x27;s approval, and Captain Schultz, who has come to take him to meet with Ehrhardt.

Joseph successfully passes himself off as Siletsky and names recently executed prisoners as the leaders of the resistance. The next day, Ehrhardt, who believes Siletsky convinced Maria to join the Nazi cause, informs her that they found Siletsky&#x27;s corpse in the theatre. Unaware of this, Joseph telephones Ehrhardt still masquerading as Siletsky and comes to meet with him. To expose Joseph as an impostor, Ehrhardt leaves him in a room with Siletsky&#x27;s dead body. Joseph has an extra fake beard, shaves off Siletsky&#x27;s beard and applies the fake beard. He then goads Ehrhardt into pulling it off, convincing him Joseph is the real Siletsky. Unaware of Joseph&#x27;s successful scheme, several actors disguised as Hitler&#x27;s safety squad arrive, yank off Joseph&#x27;s fake beard, and pretend to drag him out. Everyone is safe but now cannot leave Poland on the plane Ehrhardt had arranged for Siletsky.

The Germans stage a show to honor the visiting Hitler. The actors slip into the theater dressed as Germans and hide until Hitler and his entourage take their seats. As the Germans sing the &quot;Deutschlandlied&quot;, Greenberg suddenly appears and rushes Hitler&#x27;s box, causing enough distraction to allow the actors to infiltrate the real Germans. Acting as the head of Hitler&#x27;s guard, Joseph demands to know what Greenberg wants, giving the actor his chance to deliver Shylock&#x27;s speech, ending with &quot;if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?!&quot; Joseph orders Greenberg to be &quot;taken away&quot;. All the actors march out, including Bronski disguised as Hitler, get in Hitler&#x27;s cars and drive away.

At her apartment Maria waits for the company to pick her up, but Ehrhardt arrives and tries to seduce her. Bronski enters costumed as Hitler then walks out speechless, which makes Ehrhardt believe she&#x27;s Hitler&#x27;s mistress. Maria runs after Bronski, and Ehrhardt shoots himself out of shame.

The actors take off in Hitler&#x27;s plane, and Sobinski flies to Scotland. When Joseph is asked by the press what reward he would like for saving the underground movement, Maria asserts that he wants to play Hamlet. While performing, Joseph is gratified to see Sobinski sit quietly in the audience at the critical moment of his soliloquy. But as he proceeds, another handsome young officer gets up and heads noisily backstage.

==Production==
Lubitsch had never considered anyone other than Jack Benny for the lead role in the film. He had even written the character with Benny in mind. Benny, thrilled that a director of Lubitsch&#x27;s caliber had been thinking of him while writing it, accepted the role immediately. Benny was in a predicament as, strangely enough, his success in the film version of &quot;Charley&#x27;s Aunt&quot; (1941) did not interest anyone in hiring the actor for their films.

For Benny&#x27;s costar, the studio and Lubitsch decided on Miriam Hopkins, whose career had been faltering in recent years. The role was designed as a comeback for the veteran actress, but Hopkins and Benny did not get along well, and Hopkins left the production.

Lubitsch was left without a leading lady until Carole Lombard, hearing his predicament, asked to be considered. Lombard had never worked with the director and yearned to have an opportunity. Lubitsch agreed and Lombard was cast. The film also provided Lombard with an opportunity to work with friend Robert Stack, whom she had known since he was a teenager. The film was shot at United Artists, which allowed Lombard to say that she had worked at every major studio in Hollywood.

==Reception==
The initial reception of &quot;To Be or Not To Be&quot; was marked by public apprehension due to its satirical depiction of the Nazis. Reviewers at the time criticized the use of such a serious and palpable threat as a basis for comedy. However, modern-day critics have since come to regard the movie as one of Lubitsch&#x27;s notable achievements. According to Jack Benny&#x27;s unfinished memoir, published in 1991, Benny&#x27;s father initially left the theater in disgust at seeing his son in a Nazi uniform in the film, but Benny eventually convinced him to return. Subsequently, his father not only embraced the movie but watched it an astounding 46 times.

The same could not be said for all critics. While they generally praised Lombard, some scorned Benny and Lubitsch and found the film to be in bad taste. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that it was &quot;hard to imagine how any one can take, without batting an eye, a shattering air raid upon Warsaw right after a sequence of farce or the spectacle of Mr. Benny playing a comedy scene with a Gestapo corpse. Mr. Lubitsch had an odd sense of humor—and a tangled script—when he made this film.&quot; &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; agreed, calling the film &quot;a callous, tasteless effort to find fun in the bombing of Warsaw.&quot; Some critics were especially offended by Colonel Ehrhardt&#x27;s line: &quot;Oh, yes I saw him [Tura] in &#x27;Hamlet&#x27; once. What he did to Shakespeare we are now doing to Poland.&quot;

However, other reviews were positive. &quot;Variety&quot; called it one of Lubitsch&#x27;s &quot;best productions in [a] number of years...a solid piece of entertainment.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; called it &quot;An absorbing comedy-drama of war time, expertly directed and acted. The action holds one in tense suspense at all times, and comedy of dialogue as well as of acting keeps one laughing almost constantly.&quot; John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; also praised the film, writing &quot;That comedy could be planted in Warsaw at the time of its fall, of its conquest by the Nazis, and not seem too incongruous to be endured is a Lubitsch triumph.&quot;
In 1943, the critic Mildred Martin reviewed another of Lubitsch&#x27;s films in &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; and referred derogatively to his German birth and his comedy about Nazis in Poland. Lubitsch responded by publishing an open letter to the newspaper in which he wrote, What I have satirized in this picture are the Nazis and their ridiculous ideology. I have also satirized the attitude of actors who always remain actors regardless of how dangerous the situation might be, which I believe is a true observation. It can be argued if the tragedy of Poland realistically portrayed as in &quot;To Be or Not to Be&quot; can be merged with satire. I believe it can be and so do the audience which I observed during a screening of &quot;To Be or Not to Be&quot;; but this is a matter of debate and everyone is entitled to his point of view, but it is certainly a far cry from the Berlin-born director who finds fun in the bombing of Warsaw.

In recent times the film has become recognized as a comedy classic. &quot;To Be or Not To Be&quot; has a 96% approval rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 8.8/10, based on 52 reviews, with the consensus: &quot;A complex and timely satire with as much darkness as slapstick, Ernst Lubitsch&#x27;s To Be or Not To Be delicately balances humor and ethics.&quot; Slovenian cultural critic and philosopher, Slavoj Žižek, named it his favourite comedy, in an interview in 2015, where he remarked &quot;It is madness, you can not do a better comedy I think.&quot;

==Awards and honors==
&quot;To Be or Not to Be&quot; was nominated for one Academy Award: the Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:

<text>To Fly! is a 1976 American short docudrama film directed by Greg MacGillivray and Jim Freeman of MacGillivray Freeman Films, who wrote the story with Francis Thompson, Robert M. Young, and Arthur Zegart. It premiered at the giant-screen IMAX theater of the National Air and Space Museum, which opened to celebrate the United States Bicentennial. The film chronicles the history of aviation in the US, with a narration written by Thomas McGrath. Thematically, it explores the search for national identity through the country&#x27;s westward expansion as well as humanity&#x27;s relationship with aviation.

The idea of the film was proposed in 1970 and revisited two years later following the museum&#x27;s interest in an IMAX theater for the planned building. MacGillivray and Freeman expanded a treatment written by the Smithsonian Institution and Thompson, adding various scenes in the storyboard intended to jolt IMAX audiences. Due to the large dimensions of the screens, the filmmakers aimed for immersion and clarity via novel cinematographic techniques. This was further enhanced by the surround sound design. The ending space sequence, featuring the first IMAX rocket launch scene, was made with various experimental special effects. The film was edited by MacGillivray and Freeman, and features a score composed by Bernardo Segall. It was finished on schedule in two years, with a low US$590,000 fund from Conoco.

&quot;To Fly!&quot; was released on July 1, 1976, distributed by Lawrence Associates and Conoco. It was initially scheduled to screen only for the Bicentennial, but due to public demand was kept indefinitely. In response to these demands, a 20th-anniversary special edition was released in 1996. The film led to an increase in the number of IMAX theaters worldwide and helped popularizing the nascent format, with various intense reactions observed among audiences, and was thus included in the National Film Registry and IMAX Hall of Fame. It also set MacGillivray as a major IMAX filmmaker. With increasing popularity, &quot;To Fly!&quot; remained among the highest-grossing giant-screen documentaries. Critics praised the film in its audiovisual and narrative aspects—though some were negative on the latter—and it received several accolades.

== Summary ==
&quot;To Fly!&quot; begins in Vermont on July 4, 1831. After reciting a zestful quatrain declaring himself a pioneer, a fictional hot air balloonist named Ezekiel ascends on a voyage around New England. Spectators below look at the balloon in awe and surprise. Ezekiel sees a canoeist heading to whitewater at Horseshoe Falls and warns him to shore to avoid the rapid.

The film then chronicles the history of aviation, beginning with hot air balloons. Its advent is described by the narrator as &quot;like the opening of a new eye&quot;, allowing humans to reach untouched places and extend their limits, furthering their perspectives about the world. Despite this, the majority of Americans still used horses; for speedier travel, trains were invented, then cars and powered aircraft. The Roaring Twenties saw the rise of barnstorming, expanding access to aviation among Americans. As part of diversifying aviation, military jets were created, thereupon forming aerobatic teams like the Blue Angels. The use of jetliners made travel faster, and the American territory expanded beyond the mainland. Then, ultralight aviation was invented.

After describing the human imagination as limitless due to a philosophical awakening from the aerial view of the world, &quot;To Fly!&quot; lastly depicts the Saturn IB rocket launch for the Apollo–Soyuz mission at the Kennedy Space Center on July 15, 1975. Dubbing spaceflight a globally historical feat, the film suggests it can be used in finding extraterrestrial intelligence. The film ends with the narration:

==Production==

=== Background ===
The Smithsonian Institution made efforts starting in 1911 to modernize its museums with multimedia content, though this only accelerated since the 1960s. The idea of a giant-screen theater at the National Air and Space Museum (NASM) was mooted in 1970 in a 153-page report by the National Museum of Natural History&#x27;s (NMNH) curator team, which argued the museum needed a &quot;contemporary medium of communications&quot; that will resonate intellectually and psychologically. It suggested an experiential film that would showcase the American landscape and the country&#x27;s introduction to technology, ending with predictions of the country&#x27;s future. Among these giant-screen film formats was IMAX, characterized by its tall screen which fills the audiences&#x27; peripheral vision, triggering immersive telepresence which creates the illusion of being present within the film&#x27;s setting. The NMNH proposed a panoramic, curved IMAX screen that envelops its rotunda, but this was discarded.

In 1972, the deputy director of the Smithsonian, Melvin B. Zisfein, wrote a memo praising IMAX over other giant-screen formats like Cinerama and Circle-Vision 360°, and suggested making an IMAX film for the NASM. Several film treatments were written, the first titled &quot;The Beautiful Mysteries of Flight&quot;, though all were rejected. A year later, IMAX&#x27;s co-founder Graeme Ferguson expressed interest in an IMAX film for the US Bicentennial, also considering the possibility of it being feature-length. In 1974, after hearing about plans for a new building of the NASM at the National Mall in Washington, D.C. as part of the Bicentennial, he proposed this to the museum director Michael Collins. While Ferguson believed this would enhance the museum, Collins had not seen an IMAX film and initially rejected the proposal. However, at Expo &#x27;74, an IMAX representative convinced him to go to the IMAX theater and see Ferguson&#x27;s film &quot;Man Belongs to the Earth&quot;; he became convinced that an IMAX theater would provide a sense of realism to visitors and accepted the idea.

===Pre-production===

On July 1, 1974, giant-screen filmmaker Francis Thompson joined in proposing a film about the history of flight for the Bicentennial at the NASM theater. With a US$590,000 fund from the Continental Oil Company (Conoco), with an additional $160,000 for film rights, they set the production deadline to 1976. After writing a third treatment with Thompson, the Smithsonian commissioned filmmaker duo Greg MacGillivray and James &quot;Jim&quot; Freeman, who had previously made surf and giant-screen films with experimental editing; they had also shot aerials for &quot;Jonathan Livingston Seagull&quot; (1973) and &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; (1974). Collins told them that he did not want the film to be too history-oriented and instead be more fun. With Collins giving them full creative freedom, pre-production meetings took place in New York City for several months.

Collins and Zisfein gave around 30 suggestions, about 20 of which were incorporated into the film. MacGillivray and Freeman thought the treatment was imperfect and expanded it into a narrative docudrama with several moments of comedy. They analyzed the existing IMAX films for inspiration, including &quot;Man Belongs to the Earth&quot;, whose opening aerial shot of the Grand Canyon enthused them. Per Collins, they included scenes with comic relief in &quot;To Fly!&quot; in order to not make the film feel like a dry historical drama. Thompson agreed, saying there were enough fact-based Bicentennial films being made and that people needed more entertainment. MacGillivray said IMAX is perfect for the film because it &quot;allows me [...] to impact the audience in a greater way&quot;. He and Freeman storyboarded it with John Divers at their Laguna Beach, California, office, creating &quot;IMAX moments&quot; to thrill audiences and to rely on visuals more than narration. Seven months were spent on research, with aviators Walter J. Boyne and Donald S. Lopez Sr. as technical advisors.

Actor and real-life balloonist Peter Walker was chosen to portray Ezekiel due to his comic charm. The character was based upon a balloonist who in 1790 apparently made flights over New England while reciting self-written poems, purportedly to impress young women. Walker listed &quot;To Fly!&quot; among his favorite films to star in. Through filmmaker Randal Kleiser, whom he knew from his friend Basil Poledouris, MacGillivray partook in courses with actress Nina Foch to master in directing his cast. Extras were not mandated to speak because they comprise locals, some of whom the filmmakers felt were amateur. Freeman&#x27;s girlfriend Cindy Huston, MacGillivray&#x27;s girlfriend Barbara Smith, and production manager-costumer Jeff Blyth made cameo appearances as different characters. Huston was also focus puller, and Smith was production assistant, craft service specialist, and unit still photographer. Other writers were Thompson, Robert M. Young, and Arthur Zegart; Thomas McGrath wrote the narration. Additionally, Byron McKinney was executive producer. Documentarian and historian Jon Wilkman was briefly involved, alongside NASA, the Office of Naval Research, and the California Institute of Technology.

=== Filming ===
Principal photography occurred for five months in 1975. Filming paused two and a half months later during June for MacGillivray and Freeman to film the action scenes of &quot;Sky Riders&quot; (1976), then resumed for two and a half months. They directed and cinematographed the film, frequently switching roles and working seven days a week with a 5a.m. to 9p.m. shooting schedule. They often filmed together in a multiple-camera setup, like in one of the barnstorming shots. According to MacGillivray, &quot;To Fly!&quot; was the most fun film that he and Freeman worked on throughout their 11 years of partnership.

At the time, IMAX cameras weighed and felt &quot;crude&quot; to the filmmakers, dismaying them as they wanted to experiment with the cinematography. Furthermore, they were worried about damaging the only camera available to them, and wanted to minimize the need for retakes. Ferguson and fellow IMAX co-founders, Bill Shaw and Robert Kerr, ideated creating three new cameras with better specifications, with one of them to be used for Thompson in his other Bicentennial film, &quot;American Years&quot;. Ferguson granted the proposal. When filming an aerial scene in &quot;American Years&quot;, the camera&#x27;s parachute failed to deploy, destroying it. The pre-existing camera was also modified to be on par with the new ones.

To make the film bright, colorful, and naturalistic, the crew used the Eastman Color Negative 5254 tungsten 65 mm film stock, with the opening scene in 35 mm. The costly stock caused the short duration of 27 minutes. To give a dramatic look, they emphasized the characters with cross-backlighting or . Because of IMAX&#x27;s large screens and where the perceived center would be, many novel techniques were implemented. Extreme long shots were treated as wide-angle shots, while the latter were treated as normal shots, and close-ups were treated as medium close-ups. The latter has a wider headroom for visual comfort. Movement was condensed to ease the switching between an extreme long shot to medium close-up, and a wide-angle lens was used to further expand the film&#x27;s view. Camera lenses were also carefully chosen, ranging from the fisheye 30 mm to the telephoto 600 mm. Pentax and Hasselblad lenses were used; the latter had their focal lengths changed, shutters removed, and mounts modified. It took three months to test them and the camera magazines. However, they had no zoom lenses which MacGillivray said would have eased filming.

Many shots in the film were time-consuming to make: a 35-second shot of the Blue Angels flying over the Colorado River and Yuma Desert took over four months to choreograph. Camera mounts were designed by the United States Navy for a McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II piloted by Kevin O&#x27;Mara used to film the shot. Nelson Tyler spent two months developing two mounts for the camera helicopters to film front and side shots, providing smoothness as the smallest vibrations would be noticeable on IMAX. The helicopters were piloted by George Nolan, Chuck Phillips, and Adrian Brooks. Mounts were also made by Boeing for the Boeing 747; they used its first prototype. Art Scholl&#x27;s &quot;Super Chipmunk&quot; aircraft was used to film front shots. The Navy donated helium for the hot air balloon, thanks to the Blue Angels&#x27; presence in the film. The balloon, in shots where it actually flies, was piloted by Kurt Stehling, with whom MacGillivray has collaborated in &quot;Above San Francisco&quot; (1973).

Aerial work platforms were used to support the balloon basket and camera; two platforms supported the basket as it moved in opposing directions to heighten the illusion of flight. The balloon was decorated with 13 American flags, the number of states in the US in 1831, sewn by a vexillography shop. To create a shot in which a Sierra No. 3 train seemingly hits the camera, inspired by the allegedly jolting effects of &quot;L&#x27;Arrivée d&#x27;un train en gare de La Ciotat&quot; (1895), the crew placed a mirror in a diagonal position at the rail facing towards the camera, which imaged the mirror for a symmetrical view of the rail as the train approached and shattered it. The illusion of pilots flying was made by filming close-ups of the aircraft backdropped by the sky while the camera dawdles within a rigid camera dolly. Bob Wills flew a hang glider above the Nā Pali coastline.

Various kinds of transportation were used. In one scene, a stagecoach races with the train; previously there is a Conestoga wagon. Aerials of the 747 were filmed from a provided 737. Frank Tallman flew a Curtiss Model D for the mechanical flight scene. A Ford Model T was used in the scene talking about the invention of cars; the succeeding scene was filmed above Coastal California. Meanwhile, the Blue Angels flew Douglas A-4 Skyhawks. Other filming locations included the Gateway Arch, Lake Powell, Monument Valley, Zion Canyon, Yosemite Falls, the Appalachian Mountains, and the Sierra Nevada. The barnstorming scene was filmed in California, and the opening sequence&#x27;s forests in Parsons, West Virginia. Filming also occurred in Alaska and Craftsbury, Vermont. A barn raising scene from the opening was cut from the final release. Overall, of film stock were used.

==== Space sequence ====
&quot;To Fly!&quot; space sequence depicts the launch of the Saturn IB, before showing a fictional spaceship voyaging around the Solar System. Five nebulae are then depicted before ending with a view of Earth.

The filmmakers were given permission to film the launch, marking the first time such was filmed in IMAX. They took this part more seriously because it could not be repeated. After filming away from the launch pad, they left their camera outside for a day, forming condensation inside and exacerbated by seasonal thunderstorms. It was found wet and jammed, and the crew spent three hours cleaning it to recover the recording. Meanwhile, a shot of the Saturn V&#x27;s interstage ring jettisonning back to Earth was filmed in 16 mm film from the actual rocket&#x27;s second stage, during Apollo 4 in 1967.

With a low budget, they initially conceived the space sequence as merely a compilation of astronomical images but realized they needed some kind of movement for an IMAX film, and thus saved money on the live-action filming in order to achieve a better space sequence. They expected &quot;To Fly!&quot; to be compared with the film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968), and tried to make the sequence as reminiscent of that film as possible. They learned that small objects like stars on an IMAX screen are much smaller on a traditional presentation, and typical small stars would be oversized in IMAX; after some difficulty, they were able to create perfect-sized stars on an Kodalith negative sheet film. Because of the nature of IMAX, filming some scenes at six and twelve frames per second (fps) was preferred over stop motion. George Casey and Lester Novros of special effects company Graphic Films provided planetary models and a studio, and also assisted the crew.

The spaceship seen was a transparent portion of a larger model built by MacGillivray and Freeman, backlit on a glass frame. As special effects supervisor, Blyth designed it to have the same color palette as the 747, and inspired by concepts of advanced ion thrusters and magnetically confined fusions like deuterium and helium-3. It took 150 hours to create, with Collins as technical advisor. For a shot in which the spaceship passes Jupiter and Io, the crew filmed each object one by one; the film would be rewound back to layer in the next object. The camera was placed on a motorized dolly. Some shots, including the one of Saturn, were filmed at an animation stand. Others used a faux version of the slit-scan photography kit used for &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;: the sheet film was projected onto a white board, which the fisheye-lensed camera was put close to. Models were attached to a peg bar, near where their glass frame was suspended on. To film extreme slow shots with distinct movement, a geared head and a zoom-motored gear were used, creating a slight pan. They filmed all these on 16 mm first to see if it could be done on IMAX.

Bellows and close-up lenses by Hasselblad were used for the penultimate nebulae shots; the camera was facing a tray filled with water and a mixture of black ink and white enamel paint lit by color gels. The materials&#x27; temperature, thickness, size, and type had to be precise to achieve the reaction. Unable to film at the desired 96 fps, mineral oil and paint thinner were poured into the tray to slow down movement; the thinner was favored because it created more interesting 3D-like movements. Often, a short wire was shaped and dipped in to create specific patterns. Special effects designers Jim Palmer and Barney Kaelin created laser patterns, the first in any IMAX film. Overall, the space sequence took four and a half months to prepare, test, and film.

=== Post-production ===
&quot;To Fly!&quot; was edited by MacGillivray and Freeman, with Alexander Hammid supervising, using a Moviola. Knowing they would experiment with the editing, the film&#x27;s shots were directed beforehand to allow them to do so. The pacing of the shots was designed so that audiences can explore the entire IMAX screen. The 35 mm opening where Ezekiel is still at ground is windowboxed to 1⁄6th of the screen; as he ascends, the scene smash-dissolves and the whole screen is filled, intendedly to intensify the scene&#x27;s mood and as a reference to aviation, which the narration calls &quot;like the opening of a new eye&quot;. This was inspired by the opening scenes of &quot;This Is Cinerama&quot; (1952) and the first ever IMAX film &quot;North of Superior&quot; (1971).

The placing of multiple images on the same screen were occasionally used; these were inspired by the multi-image films &quot;In the Labyrinth&quot; (1967) and &quot;Tiger Child&quot; (1970), made by IMAX&#x27;s precursor Multiscreen. In one scene of the Blue Angels, the screen divides into 36 duplicates of the same shot. With IMAX screens having a different focus center, thus making an evenly-divided multi-image scene confusing for audiences, Jim Liles of the Optical Department at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and filmmaker Dennis Earl Moore designed new mattes in which the bottom row is 15% larger than the top. Smith supervised the curation of archival and original footage to be incorporated into these scenes. After four months of editing, two Norelco AAII 70/35 mm projectors were installed to preview in the highest quality possible.

MacGillivray chose the film&#x27;s score to be composed and conducted by Bernardo Segall. It was performed by a 49-piece symphony orchestra at the Burbank Studios which he considered &quot;the most professional and experienced&quot; in California that he could find. Segall&#x27;s works were described by MacGillivray as having &quot;an air of sophistication and elegance, which would maintain the steady rhythm and pulse of the film&quot;. The score was the first in history to use a keyed bugle, which is also depicted in the film&#x27;s opening scene: at the gathering for Ezekiel&#x27;s ascent, a small fanfare band plays a fife, drum, clarinet, and B♭ keyed bugle. The score was then edited by Richard R. McCurdy and mixed by Dan Wallin. It was recorded in 16 channels and then downmixed to three of the six channels on a 35 mm sound follower, which would play in sync with the picture in theaters.

Sound design was done at Todd-AO&#x27;s Hollywood, Los Angeles, studio. Sam Shaw edited the sound effects while Ray West and Jack Woltz mixed them. Some scenes in the film were made solely to exploit IMAX&#x27;s sound technology. For example, a multi-image scene in which two jets cross each other uses the surround nature of the sound system; MacGillivray expected audiences to &quot;shiver&quot; due to the dramatic shift of attention. In the train screen-hitting shot, the horn and engine noise gradually surround the audience. Joseph Ellison also helped with the sound design, which completed on June 18, 1976. After post-production, which—combined with the space sequence production—took six months, Conoco applauded the film&#x27;s rough cut. The company&#x27;s investors and the Smithsonian gave input for the final cut, which spanned more than of film stock.

== Themes and style ==
&quot;To Fly!&quot; is described as a hegemonic film on how the imagination of the American people pioneered aviation, illustrated with scenes of aircraft flying over various American landscapes. Film critic Daniel Eagan said most of the views depicted in its opening sequence are &quot;stately, processional, celebrating the American landscape while remaining distant from it&quot;. From there, the film explores the US, triggering &quot;some patriotic empathy.&quot; It was also viewed as a nationalist film, linking the American quest for national identity to the development of aviation through metanarratives like the linear, westward journey of Americans. Like other early IMAX films, its omniscient visual rhetoric is most distinct in the space sequence. The film generally shies away from the Industrial Revolution&#x27;s effects on the US in favor of displaying untouched nature. The Smithsonian said that &quot;To Fly!&quot; theme is: &quot;Flight, in all its forms, is part of the Human condition, part of our Destiny&quot;. This refers to manifest destiny, a mythic cultural belief that propelled the westward expansion.

Collins said &quot;To Fly!&quot; style makes it &quot;a break from the learning going on in the rest of the museum&quot;, and NASM board members said it is an amplification of visitors&#x27; fascination of flying after seeing the museum&#x27;s exhibits. Film author Alison Griffiths agreed, saying that as an add-on to a museum admission, whereas the exhibits give visitors information and interest, the film gives them a sense of wonder for aviation in an effect akin to synesthesia. This is achieved through its immersive cinematography, which provides viewers with vicarious participation. Steve McKerrow of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; opined certain scenes reference classic films: the train screen-hitting scene is similar to the one from &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; (1903); the hot air balloon scenes are reminiscent of &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; (1956); and the barnstorming scene is seemingly set in the same field as the &quot;North by Northwest&quot; (1959) crop duster chase scene. As a travelogue film of the US, &quot;To Fly!&quot; was also compared to the closing sequence of &quot;This Is Cinerama&quot;. The aerial shots of various lands also signify aviation&#x27;s usage in cartography, reconnaissance, resource exploration, land-use planning, and navigation.

== Release ==

=== NASM ===
The first press announcements of &quot;To Fly!&quot; were issued on May 16, 1976, and the film was previewed to members of the US Congress on June 24 at the NASM&#x27;s IMAX theater (later renamed Samuel Pierpoint Langley, then Lockheed Martin). Two days prior to the preview, Freeman died in a helicopter crash while finding locations for a commercial at the Sierra Nevada. Grief-stricken, MacGillivray initially doubted he could continue filmmaking but decided to retain, keeping the company&#x27;s name, MacGillivray Freeman Films (MFF), as a tribute.

&quot;To Fly!&quot; premiered on July 1, 1976, labeled as sponsored by Conoco. The New York City-based Lawrence Associates handled theatrical distribution. With underwriting concerns, the Smithsonian prohibited Conoco from using the Smithsonian&#x27;s name for commercial uses, but granted &quot;limited right&quot; to use Conoco&#x27;s name for it. It was later relabeled as sponsored by parent company DuPont. MacGillivray assisted the inexperienced projectionists and frequently visited the booth to ensure that the film roll was in consistently mint condition. A Pachelbel&#x27;s Canon rendition was played as an overture; it was praised as being memorable and evocative. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; credited the film alongside &quot;Ordinary People&quot; (1980) for the music&#x27;s popularity. The NASM also released pin-back buttons depicting a hot air balloon, manufactured by Horn Co.

The film was initially scheduled for a one-year run, as were other Bicentennial films, but was retained due to high demand. At times, there were 14 shows daily. In the 1990s, attempts were made again to remove &quot;To Fly!&quot;, but due to public grievances it was decided that a special edition be made in conjunction with the theater&#x27;s digital sound system upgrade, released for its 20th anniversary in 1996. The audio was digitally remastered with new sound effects, a new narrator, and alterations of the score such as trimming, editing, and adding choral sounds. The Lake Powell-Monument Valley scene and space sequence have their music changed, and two existential narrations from the space sequence were cut. Celebrating its silver jubilee in 2001, a screening was made free. During its 35th anniversary in 2011, screenings were charged at 50 cents for adults and 25 cents for children, the same price up to the 1980s; in 1976, it was charged at $1 for adults and 50 cents for children, but fearing they were making too much profit, it was halved six months later. The Airbus IMAX Theater of the NASM&#x27;s annex, the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, has also been screening &quot;To Fly!&quot;.

=== Other venues ===
&quot;To Fly!&quot; spurred the mass construction of IMAX theaters in various countries. The Smithsonian later also built an IMAX theater at the NMNH. Due to the film&#x27;s intrigue, especially the transformative opening sequence, various museums established IMAX theaters. Other screening formats include the dome-shaped Omnimax and the digital IMAX with Laser. For the first 15 months since its opening in April 1983, &quot;To Fly!&quot; was the only film shown at the IMAX theater at the National Museum of Photography, Film &amp; Television (NMPFT) in Bradford, England, and its reception made them retain the theater. It was rescreened in 2013 for the museum&#x27;s 30th anniversary. Michael Kernan of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; credited word of mouth to the popularity because advertising was mainly via brochures, newspapers, and television. MacGillivray noted a 1981 &quot;Today&quot; interview of him and Thompson by Tom Brokaw as among the things that led to the film&#x27;s continued popularity, though said he did not expect such popularity.

Several theaters played the film in a double feature, like the NASM and American Museum of Natural History&#x27;s Naturemax Theater (February 11, 1982), who bundled it with &quot;Living Planet&quot; (1979) and &quot;Man Belongs to the Earth&quot;. The NASM later replaced &quot;Living Planet&quot; with MFF&#x27;s &quot;Speed&quot; (1984). &quot;To Fly!&quot; was put with &quot;Blue Planet&quot; (1990) at the Montreal and Maryland Science Center as they similarly showcase spaceflight. It was also the premiere film for IMAX theaters of theme parks like Six Flags Great America&#x27;s Pictorium (1979), Dreamworld in Gold Coast, Australia (1981), and Speelland Beekse Bergen at Hilvarenbeek, Netherlands (June 19, 1981). Dreamworld founder John Longhurst was inspired to build the theater after seeing &quot;To Fly!&quot;.

Overall, the film has screened in over 24 countries, including Germany, Japan, Mexico, and Indonesia (Keong Emas IMAX Theater, Jakarta). It has been translated to 10 languages and screened at around 150 theaters worldwide. It was also shown in festivals like the 1976 Toronto International Film Festival, who took it from the Edinburgh International Film Festival, and the 2019 IMAX Victoria Film Festival who made a double feature with &quot;North of Superior&quot; titled &quot;The Dawn of IMAX Filmmaking&quot;. Conoco also distributed &quot;To Fly!&quot; to schools, organizations, and non-IMAX theaters after September 6, 1976 (Labor Day), but the lack of non-IMAX screenings made it unpopular among filmgoers. They also sent 16 mm copies of the film to all 600 existing independent television stations in the US to be aired for free, as a marketing strategy. On May 28, 2023, the non-IMAX theater Cleveland Cinematheque put it together with MFF&#x27;s &quot;Great Barrier Reef&quot; (2018) and &quot;Great Bear Rainforest&quot; (2019), in a series of MFF double features.

=== Home media ===

In 1985, &quot;To Fly!&quot; was released on videocassette formats Betamax and VHS, while its LaserDisc was in 1991 by Lumivision, catalog number LVD9113. The latter, as well as a VHS of the anniversary edition by IMAX subsidiary DKP 70MM Inc., features Dolby Surround-encoded audio. On March 20, 2011, the first VHS was preserved at the Hagley Museum and Library and is freely available at their finding aid website. For the VHS, the windowboxed opening scene was zoomed to fill the entire screen, and a large portion of the opening drum roll was cut. Together with the LaserDisc and second VHS, the film is cropped to the television 1.33:1 aspect ratio, in lieu of the slightly wider IMAX 1.44:1. On October 7, 2021, MFF launched a streaming service called Movies For Families and included &quot;To Fly!&quot; anniversary edition, cropped to the widescreen ratio of 1.78:1. The multi-image scenes were re-adjusted, like the 36-duplicate shot which became 30.

== Reception ==

=== Box office ===

&quot;To Fly!&quot; is regarded as the first blockbuster IMAX film. Over one million people watched it during its first year at the NASM, with approximately 80% of its 485 seats occupied. Initially, Collins had projected three and a half NASM visitors to view it. By 1980, it amassed more than 6.3 million viewers, with an average seat occupation of 77%, growing to 6.5 million by 1983. Over 15 million people have watched it at the museum; 4 million of which were in its three years, then 4.5 million the following year. By 1982, around 100 million audiences were recorded across the US. By 1991, over 100 million people have viewed &quot;To Fly!&quot; at schools and on television. In 1996, &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; dubbed &quot;To Fly!&quot; &quot;the longest-running ticketed film in one location in history&quot; and reported that it accumulated over 300 million views worldwide. From 2000 to 2012, there was an audience addition of 1.5 million at the NASM. Overall, the film is the longest-exhibited documentary and sponsored film in the world.

Museums like the NASM and NMPFT used early earnings of the film to underwrite expenses, maintain theaters, and/or fund IMAX films. It grew from $20 million in 1993—thus being the 14th highest-grossing independently distributed film in the US and Canada (excluding erotic films)— to $100 million in 1999. Up to 2000, it earned $50 million in the NASM alone. &quot;To Fly!&quot; was the third highest-grossing IMAX documentary as of 2002, earning $113 million, behind &quot;The Dream is Alive&quot; (1985, $150 million) and MFF&#x27;s &quot;Everest&quot; (1998, $114 million). It gained a net addition of $2.7 million up to early 2003, then a gross $900,000 throughout the year, and another $11.3 million up to 2011. In between that, &quot;The Numbers&quot; reported over $86.6 million within the US and Canada and $34.1 million elsewhere, totaling at $120.7 million. This meant the film became the second-highest-grossing 1976 film behind &quot;Rocky&quot;, which earned $117.2 million, and above &quot;A Star is Born&quot;, which earned $63.1 million. MFF reported an overall $135 million gross as of December 2019, thus being the company&#x27;s second highest-grossing documentary film after &quot;Everest&quot;.

=== Critical response ===
&quot;To Fly!&quot; was well-received by many film critics; John Alderson of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; summarized that &quot;the subject charms its imagination, while the IMAX format goes right to the brink of sensory overload&quot;. Contemporary critics called it underrated and electric, with David Handler of the Newspaper Enterprise Association dubbing it &quot;the ultimate film trip&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it an icon of the city and a must-watch to all Washingtonians. The film was cited by scholars and authors as examplifying the role of screen size in amplifying a film&#x27;s kinesthetic thrills. Some called &quot;To Fly!&quot; one of the best IMAX films, with guides like the &quot;Michelin Green Guide&quot; and one by &quot;BioScience&quot; calling it a must-watch for those planning to visit the NASM.

The cinematography was praised for its innovativeness and vertiginous aesthetics, equated to theme park rides and epic films, which was further amplified by Segall&#x27;s score. &quot;The Tampa Tribune&quot; rated the film three out of four stars, deeming the Horseshoe Falls and barnstorming scenes the best. The opening scene was praised for being banal which effectively shocks audiences during the giant-screen transition. Donna Whitehead of &quot;Norwalk News&quot; called it intimate and stellar, and the ending uplifting. John Russell, an art critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, credited the cinematography to the audiences&#x27; immersion in the story, which progressively improves throughout the film. Critics called it poetic and paean-like, citing its expressive depictions of nature and aviation. The film&#x27;s vintage-contemporary duality was credited by &quot;The Gaffney Ledger&quot; for its nostalgic weight. Nathan Southern of AllMovie gave the film four and a half stars out of five, deeming it a visually vivid historical insight and &quot;one of the greatest unsung landmarks of American documentary&quot;. As the filmmakers intended, Alderson likened the space sequence to that of &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;.

The narration was praised as personal and meditative, though others found it cursory and superfluous. Some critics panned Ezekiel&#x27;s character as banal and mawkish, and the omissions of real-life aviation pioneers were noted, alongside how in some shots the balloon appears to be immobile. Filmmaker Mark R. Hasan thought the Betamax audio lacks quality in the dialogue, though he noted the film is highly degraded on videocassette from the original, and said &quot;To Fly!&quot; excels starting from the barnstorming scene. While some praised its effectiveness for inspiring audiences even in smaller formats, others found its panoramas to be boring, similar to other IMAX films that are said to overexploit immersion as a gimmick. With familiarity to the later catalog of &quot;more intrepid&quot; IMAX films, the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; found &quot;To Fly!&quot; impressiveness debatable for many modern first-time viewers. Because of this, the newspaper graded it C in a 1998 review. Meanwhile, documentarian Ross Anthony graded it B+, or two and a half stars out of four, noting that he would have graded it A in the 1970s, and deemed &quot;To Fly!&quot; &quot;amusing and informative (on a basic level)&quot;.

=== Audience response ===
The Smithsonian reported a diverse demographic of audiences, who were reportedly &quot;astonished&quot; by &quot;To Fly!&quot; IMAX vertiginous shots. Shouts and gasps were heard in screenings, especially during the opening sequence—where people exclaimed in awe—as well as at the Blue Angels and hang-gliding scenes. Others, however, screamed in fright and &quot;hastily&quot; left the theater during its vertiginous scenes; journalist Douglas Preston attributed this to nausea. For some, uncontrollable dizziness lingered long after the film had finished, equated by &quot;Time&quot; magazine with airsickness. Vomit bags were unavailable, making the film inaccessible for people with vertigo. Later, the NASM added pre-entry warnings about potential dizziness and motion sickness. On the contrary, some people noted they were able to watch &quot;To Fly!&quot; without getting scared due to it being illusionary.

Many who watched the film returned with their children to rewatch it, akin to a generational tradition. Similar remarks were made by Carl Sagan, who remained astonished after seeing it more than five times at the NASM. Several pilots credited the film for propelling their interest in aviation, including astronaut Terry W. Virts to whom &quot;To Fly!&quot; is his first, and among his most memorable, childhood IMAX films. Dan Moran of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; said it is among the few films that kept Pictorium audiences awake instead of asleep. The 2011 Virginia earthquake coincided with &quot;To Fly!&quot; Horseshoe Falls scene at Lockheed Martin; projectionist Keith Madden and audiences assumed the shaking they felt came from the theater&#x27;s subwoofers rather than an earthquake. Modern expert hang-gliders were surprised at the hang-gliding stunt by Wills, described as dynamic yet on an &quot;impossibly simple craft&quot;.

Responding to the film&#x27;s popularity, Bill McCabe of the DuPont Aerospace Enterprise said that because humans have a supposedly innate interest in flying, the film has a universal appeal. Several educators categorized it as educational entertainment, though with less interest among field trip groups than other IMAX documentaries. The audience response prompted the Smithsonian to write a tagline on their website: &quot;&quot;Feel&quot; the Earth Drop Away Beneath You&quot;. &quot;Feel&quot; was later changed to &quot;Watch&quot;. In 2013 to commemorate its 37th anniversary, a new poster artwork was created with the tagline &quot;Go where dreams have wings&quot;, and in 2016, a 40th-anniversary one-minute trailer was released. MacGillivray opined that the film&#x27;s &quot;unpretentiousness and lightheartedness&quot; makes it a form of escapism and its unconventional ending makes it &quot;more profound and in a way, more lasting&quot;.

=== Accolades ===
By 1992, &quot;To Fly!&quot; had received 11 awards.
== Legacy ==

&quot;To Fly!&quot; is regarded as an influential IMAX film, with filmmaker and author Lenny Lipton calling it the giant-screen film industry&#x27;s &quot;signature film&quot;. Jon Wilkman, writing for &quot;Literary Hub&quot;, listed the film in 2020 as one of the &quot;21 Documentaries That Redefined the Genre&quot;. In 1980, Kernan listed the film as one of the top reasons people visited Washington, D.C., alongside the Washington Monument and J. Edgar Hoover Building. It also has a significant history with political figures, viewed by heads of state from Egypt, Greece, Indonesia, Spain, and the United Kingdom. During his first inauguration in 1981, US President Ronald Reagan handed a copy of it to Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, and later showed it to him while in Moscow. When George H. W. Bush met Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir in 1989, they went to the NASM and watched &quot;To Fly!.&quot;

Contrary to popular belief, the film is not the first in IMAX, though was instrumental in introducing more people to the format. This was acknowledged by IMAX filmmakers like Kieth Merrill of &quot;Grand Canyon: The Hidden Secrets&quot; (1984), and Ron Fricke who decided to film &quot;Chronos&quot; (1985) in IMAX after seeing &quot;To Fly!&quot;, regretting not shooting his more-popular film &quot;Koyaanisqatsi&quot; (1982) with it. Brian J. Terwilliger theatrically premiered his IMAX film &quot;Living in the Age of Airplanes&quot; (2015) at Lockheed Martin as a tribute to &quot;To Fly!&quot; which he watched as a teenager. Christopher Nolan watched the film at the age of 14 and noticed the audience tilting their heads during the aerial scenes; MacGillivray also consulted him on the IMAX cameras for &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; (2008), the first major feature-length film to be shot on IMAX and whose aerial scenes were inspired by &quot;To Fly!&quot;. After watching the film, scientist Anatoly Sagalevich ideated the underwater IMAX film &quot;Titanica&quot; (1992) to filmmaker Stephen Low.

The film was also cited as a great influence on the legitimization of IMAX and multi-image scenes in IMAX films, which has been common practice ever since. A reviewer urged major film companies to &quot;watch out&quot;, predicting &quot;To Fly!&quot; would set IMAX as a leading film format over Cinerama and 3D. In 1995, the Library of Congress deemed &quot;To Fly!&quot; a pioneer of the format, thus culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant for the National Film Registry, an American film preservation effort, which archived its reduction prints. Voters at the Giant Screen Theater Association included it in the IMAX Hall of Fame on September 24, 2001, a decision praised by IMAX&#x27;s then-co-chief executive officers Richard Gelfond and Bradley J. Wechsler, stating the film deserves such recognition.

In 1980, the NASM requested another IMAX film, prompting Moore to collaborate with MacGillivray on &quot;Flyers&quot; (1982), which Conoco funded and became a box-office success too. MFF continued making IMAX documentaries, two of which were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Short Subject: &quot;The Living Sea&quot; (1995), also inducted into the IMAX Hall of Fame; and &quot;Dolphins&quot;, which was the highest-grossing documentary of 2000. Still active, the company is regarded one of the most influential IMAX figures with over $1 billion of box-office earnings. In 1996, MacGillivray released &quot;The Magic of Flight&quot;, a film about the Blue Angels which serves as the spiritual sequel of &quot;To Fly!&quot; scene featuring the squadron.

<doc id="76391" wikidata="Q35452" url="?curid=76391" title="Bislama">
<text>Bislama ( ; ; also known by its earlier French name, ) is an English-based creole language. It is the national language of Vanuatu, and one of the three official languages of the country, the other ones being English and French. Bislama is the first language of many of the &quot;Urban ni-Vanuatu&quot; (citizens who live in Port Vila and Luganville) and the second language of much of the rest of the country&#x27;s residents. The lyrics of &quot;Yumi, Yumi, Yumi&quot;, the country&#x27;s national anthem, are composed in Bislama.

More than 95% of Bislama words are of English origin, whilst the remainder comprises a few dozen words from French as well as some specific vocabulary inherited from various languages of Vanuatu—although these are essentially limited to flora and fauna terminology. While the influence of these vernacular languages is low on the vocabulary side, it is very high in the morphosyntax. As such, Bislama can be described simply as a language with an English vocabulary and an Oceanic grammar and phonology.

==History==
During the period of &quot;blackbirding&quot; in the 1870s and 1880s, hundreds of thousands of Pacific islanders (many of them from the New Hebrides – now the Vanuatu archipelago) were taken as indentured labourers, often kidnapped, and forced to work on plantations, mainly in Queensland, Australia, and Fiji. With several languages being spoken in these plantations a localised pidgin was formed, combining English vocabulary with grammatical structures typical of languages in the region. This early plantation pidgin is the origin not only of Bislama, but also of Tok Pisin in Papua New Guinea, and Pijin of the Solomon Islands; though not of Torres Strait Creole in the north of Australia.

This creole started spreading throughout the Vanuatu archipelago at the turn of the 20th century, as former blackbirds and their descendants began to return to their native islands. Knowledge of this creole would facilitate communication not only with European traders and settlers, but also between native populations, and because Vanuatu is the most language-dense country in the world (one count puts it at 113 languages for a population of 225,000), Bislama usefully serves as a lingua franca for communication between ni-Vanuatu, as well as with and between foreigners. Although it has been primarily a spoken-only language for most of its history, the first dictionary of Bislama was published in 1977. A new dictionary was published in 1995. This, along with its second edition in 2004, has helped to create a standardised and uniform spelling of written Bislama.

Besides Bislama, most ni-Vanuatu also know their local language, the local language of their father and/or mother, as well as their spouse, oftentimes. The country&#x27;s official languages of tuition in schools and educational institutions are English and French.

===Name===
The name of Bislama (also referred to, especially in French, as &quot;Bichelamar&quot;) comes via the early 19th century word &quot;Beach-la-Mar&quot; from pseudo-French &quot;biche de mer&quot; or &quot;bêche de mer&quot;, sea cucumber, which itself comes from an alteration of the Portuguese &quot;sea animal&quot;. In the early 1840s, sea cucumbers were also harvested and dried at the same time that sandalwood was gathered. The names &quot;biche-la-mar&quot; and &quot;Sandalwood English&quot; came to be associated with the kind of pidgin that came to be used by the local laborers between themselves, as well as their English-speaking overseers.

Robert Louis Stevenson wrote in an account of his travels through the Pacific in 1888 and 1889, &quot;the natives themselves have often scraped up a little English ... or an efficient pidgin, what is called to the westward &quot;Beach-la-Mar&quot;.&quot; In Jack London&#x27;s story &quot;Yah! Yah! Yah!&quot;, one of his &quot;South Sea Tales&quot;, there is repeated a reference to &quot;a bastard lingo called &quot;bech-de-mer&quot;&quot;, and much of the story&#x27;s dialogue is conducted in it.

Today, the word &quot;bislama&quot; itself is seldom used by younger speakers of Bislama to refer to sea cucumbers, as a new re-borrowing from pseudo-French &quot;bêche de mer&quot;, which has taken the form &quot;besdemea&quot;, has become more popular.

==Dialectal variations==
Dialects exist, based mainly on different pronunciations in different areas which stem from the different sounds of the native languages. The future tense marker can be heard to be said as: Bambae, Mbae, Nambae, or Bae. There are also preferences for using Bislama or native words that vary from place to place, and most people insert English, French, or local language words to fill out Bislama. So in the capital city it is common to hear &#x27;computer&#x27;; in other places one might hear &#x27;ordinateur&#x27;.

== Pacific creole comparison ==
==Orthography==
The Bislama Latin alphabet uses the letters &quot;A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, R, S, T, U, V, W, Y&quot; and the digraphs &quot;AE&quot;, &quot;AO&quot; and &quot;NG&quot;.

An older Latin orthography, used before 1995, had &quot;É&quot; (now written &quot;E&quot;), &quot;AI&quot; and &quot;AU&quot; (now &quot;AE&quot; and &quot;AO&quot;). For those vowels in hiatus, &quot;AÏ&quot; and &quot;AÜ&quot; were used (now written &quot;AI&quot; and &quot;AU&quot;). Labialized consonants (used in loanwords), now written with a tilde (&quot;M̃&quot; and &quot;P̃&quot;) or a following &quot;W&quot; (&quot;MW&quot; and &quot;PW&quot;), were then spelled with a macron, following the conventions used for some vernacular Vanuatu languages: &quot;M̄&quot; was used for and &quot;P̄&quot; for .

On the island of Pentecost, the avoiuli script is sometimes used for Bislama. The shapes of the letters derive from sand-drawing. It has distinct letters for &quot;NG&quot; and &quot;NGG&quot;, but otherwise corresponds closely to the Latin alphabet above, though capitals are seldom used, punctuation differs, there are digits for higher numbers and logograms for commonly traded commodities such as pig tusks.

==Grammar==
Two frequent words in Bislama are &quot;long&quot; and &quot;blong&quot;, which take the place of many prepositions in English or French.

===&quot;Long&quot;===
*&quot;Long&quot; as &#x27;next to&#x27;, &#x27;by&#x27;, &#x27;beside&#x27; etc.
*;Stoa long haos: The store next to the house.
*&quot;long&quot; as &#x27;at&#x27; or &#x27;to&#x27;
*;Mi bin stap long ples ia bifo: I have been to this place before.
*;Mi stap long stoa: I am at the store.
*&quot;long&quot; as &#x27;in&#x27;
*;Jea long haos: The chair in the house.

&quot;Long&quot; holds many other related meanings, and is sometimes used in improvisation.

===&quot;Blong&quot;===
Originally from the English word &quot;belong&quot;, &quot;blong&quot; takes the place of &#x27;of&#x27; or the genitive case in other languages. Just like &quot;of&quot; in English, it is one of the most widely used and versatile words in the language, and can indicate possession, country of origin, defining characteristics, intention, and others.

;Buk blong mi: The book that belongs to me, my book
;Man blong Amerika: Man from America, American.
;Hemi woman blong saiens: She is a woman of science, She is a scientist.
;Man blong dring: Man of drinking i.e. a drinker

===Verbs===
Verbs in Bislama usually consist of a stem word (borrowed from English, French or indigenous languages); most transitive verbs add to this a transitive suffix.

The form of that suffix is /-em/, /-im/, or /-um/, depending on vowel harmony. If the last vowel of the verb&#x27;s stem is either -u- or -i-, then that vowel will normally be copied into the transitive suffix – however, there are rare exceptions. For all other stem vowels, the transitive suffix has its default form /-em/:

Exceptions exist, such as &quot;lukim&quot; (&quot;look&quot;).

Examples of transitive verbs which exceptionally &quot;don&#x27;t&quot; take this suffix include: &quot;kakae&quot; &#x27;eat, bite&#x27;; &quot;trink&quot; &#x27;drink&#x27;; &quot;save&quot; &#x27;know&#x27;; &quot;se&quot; &#x27;say&#x27;.

Verbs do not conjugate. The tense, aspect and mood of a sentence are indicated with markers such as &quot;stap&quot;, &quot;bin&quot; and &quot;bae&quot; that are placed in the sentence.

;Mi stap kakae taro: I&#x27;m eating taro
;Mi bin kakae taro: I have eaten taro
;Bae mi kakae taro: I will eat taro

===Nouns===
The plural is formed by putting &quot;ol&quot; before the word. For example, &quot;bia&quot; &#x27;beer&#x27;; &quot;ol bia&quot; = &quot;beers&quot;. &quot;Ol&quot; comes from the English &quot;all&quot;. When used with numbers, the singular form is used. 2 bia, 3 bia, etc.

===Pronouns===

The personal pronouns of Bislama closely resemble those of Tok Pisin. They feature four grammatical numbers (singular, dual, trial and plural) and also encode the clusivity distinction: 1st person non-singular pronouns (equivalent of English &quot;we&quot;) are described as &quot;inclusive&quot; if they include the addressee (i.e. {you + I}, {you + I + others}), but &quot;exclusive&quot; otherwise (i.e. {I + other people}). Bislama pronouns do not decline.

The third person singular &quot;hem&quot;, also written &quot;em&quot; lacks gender distinction, so it can mean either he, she or it. The predicate marker i – a particle which is placed before the verbal phrase of a sentence – is sometimes merged with the third person pronoun, giving the words hemi and emi, respectively, in singular, and oli in plural.

===Tense/aspect/mood markers===
*stap + V : (progressive) ongoing or habitual action
*;hem i stap kukum kumala: or:
:;hemi stap kukum kumala: he/she is cooking sweet potatoes
*bin + V : past tense (with implication that the state is no longer true)
*;hem i bin sik long fiva: she was sick with fever [but is no longer sick]
*V + finis : (perfective) &quot;already&quot; (when placed at the end of a phrase; elsewhere it means &quot;finish&quot;)
*;hem i kakae finis: she has already eaten
*bae + V (occasionally bambae): (irrealis) future or hypothetical actions (though, like in English, generally not used in conditional sentences)
*;bae mi go long Santo: I will go to Santo
*;: If the plane hadn&#x27;t been full, I would have gone to Santo
*no + V : negative, &quot;not&quot;
*;hem i no wantem yam: he doesn&#x27;t want yam
*nomo + V: &quot;no longer&quot; (when placed after the predicate; elsewhere it means &quot;only&quot;)
*;hem i nomo kakae yam: he no longer eats yam
*;hem i kakae yam nomo: he only eats yam
*neva + V : never
*;hem i neva kakae yam: he&#x27;s never eaten yam
*jes + V : (&lt;&quot;just&quot;) an action that has recently occurred
*;: we just woke up
*In a future context, &quot;jes&quot; entails a delay, rendered in English as &quot;eventually&quot;:
*;bae mi pem: I will buy it / Let me buy it
*;bae mi jes pem, be noyet: I will buy it (eventually), but not yet
*V + gogo : continued action
*;hem i kukum kumala gogo: he keeps on cooking sweet potatoes
*mas + V : &quot;must&quot;, be obliged to
*;hem i mas kakae: he must eat
*traem + V : &quot;try to&quot;; also sometimes used for politeness in requests
*;hem i stap traem katem: he&#x27;s trying to cut it
*;traem soem long mi: could you show it me? (request)
*wantem + V : &quot;want to&quot;
*;hem i wantem go long Santo: she wants to go to Santo
*save + V : be able to, or be in the habit of doing
*;mi save rid: I can read
*;mi no save dring suga: I don&#x27;t take sugar in drinks
*;fish ia i save kilim man: this fish can kill a person

Some of these markers also have lexical meanings. For example, &quot;save&quot; can mean &quot;be able to&quot; but it is also a verb &quot;know&quot;.

=== Subordination ===
*sapos + Clause : if
;: if we find a pig, we&#x27;ll kill it

<doc id="76393" wikidata="Q650953" url="?curid=76393" title="Participatory economics">
<text>Participatory economics, often abbreviated Parecon, is an economic system based on participatory decision making as the primary economic mechanism for allocation in society. In the system, the say in decision-making is proportional to the impact on a person or group of people. Participatory economics is a form of a socialist decentralized planned economy involving the collective ownership of the means of production. It is a proposed alternative to contemporary capitalism and centralized planning. This economic model is primarily associated with political theorist Michael Albert and economist Robin Hahnel, who describes participatory economics as an anarchist economic vision.

The underlying values that parecon seeks to implement are: equity, solidarity, diversity, workers&#x27; self-management, efficiency (defined as accomplishing goals without wasting valued assets), and sustainability. The institutions of parecon include workers&#x27; and consumers&#x27; councils utilising self-managerial methods for decision-making, balanced job complexes, remuneration based on individual effort, and wide decentralized planning. In parecon, self-management constitutes a replacement for the mainstream conception of economic freedom, which Albert and Hahnel argue by its very vagueness has allowed it to be abused by capitalist ideologues.

Albert and Hahnel claim that participatory economics has been practiced to varying degrees during the Russian Revolution of 1917, Spanish Revolution of 1936, and occasionally in South America.

==Work and distribution==
=== Balanced job complexes ===
A balanced job complex is a collection of tasks within a given workplace that is balanced for its equity and empowerment implications against all other job complexes in that workplace.
=== Compensation for effort and sacrifice (principle for distribution) ===
Albert and Hahnel argue that it is inequitable and ineffective to compensate people on the basis of luck (e.g. skills or talents that owe to their birth or heredity), or by virtue of workers&#x27; productivity (as measured by the &quot;value&quot; of the goods they produce). Therefore, the primary principle of participatory economics is to reward workers for their effort and sacrifice. Additionally, participatory economics would provide exemptions from the compensation for effort principle. 

The starting point for the income of all workers in a participatory economy is an equal share of the social product. From this point, incomes for personal expenditures and consumption rights for public goods can be expected to diverge by small degrees, reflecting the choices that individuals make in between work and leisure time, and the level of danger and difficulty of a job as judged by their immediate workplace peers.

==Allocation of resource==

Albert and Hahnel argue that decentralized planning can achieve Pareto optimum, and does so under less restrictive assumptions than free market models (see: the first fundamental theorem of welfare economics). Their model incorporates both public goods and externalities, whereas markets do not achieve Pareto optimality when including these conditions.

=== Facilitation boards ===

In a proposed participatory economy, key information relevant to converging on an economic plan would be made available by Iteration Facilitation Boards (IFBs), which, based on proposals from worker/consumer councils and economic data, present indicative prices and economic projections at each round of the planning process.

The IFB has no decision-making authority. In theory, the IFB&#x27;s activity can consist mainly of computers performing the (agreed upon) algorithms for adjusting prices and forecasts, with little human involvement.

== Motivations (opposition to central planning and capitalism) ==

Robin Hahnel has argued that &quot;participatory planning is not central planning&quot;, stating &quot;The procedures are completely different and the incentives are completely different. And one of the important ways in which it is different from central planning is that it is incentive compatible, that is, actors have an incentive to report truthfully rather than an incentive to misrepresent their capabilities or preferences.&quot; Unlike historical examples of central planning, the parecon proposal advocates the use and adjustment of price information reflecting marginal social opportunity costs and benefits as integral elements of the planning process. Hahnel has argued emphatically against Milton Friedman&#x27;s a priori tendency to deny the possibility of alternatives:

Friedman assumes away the best solution for coordinating economic activities. He simply asserts &quot;there are only two ways of coordinating the economic activities of millions—central direction involving the use of coercion—and voluntary cooperation, the technique of the marketplace.&quot; [...] a participatory economy can permit all to partake in economic decision making in proportion to the degree they are affected by outcomes. Since a participatory system uses a system of participatory planning instead of markets to coordinate economic activities, Friedman would have us believe that participatory planning must fall into the category of &quot;central direction involving the use of coercion.&quot;

Albert and Hahnel have voiced detailed critiques of centrally-planned economies in theory and practice, but are also highly-critical of capitalism. Hahnel claims &quot;the truth is capitalism aggravates prejudice, is the most inequitable economy ever devised, is grossly inefficient—even if highly energetic—and is incompatible with both economic and political democracy. In the present era of free-market triumphalism it is useful to organize a sober evaluation of capitalism responding to Friedman&#x27;s claims one by one.&quot;

=== Critique of markets ===
Mainstream economists largely acknowledge the problem of externalities but believe they can be addressed either through Coasian bargaining or the use of Pigovian taxes—corrective taxes on goods that produce negative externalities. 
While Hahnel (and Albert) favour the use of Pigovian taxes as solutions to environmental problems within market economies (over alternatives such as the issuance of marketable permits), he is critical about the regressive incidence of such taxes. Firms in a market economy will seek to shift the costs of taxation onto their consumers. While this might be considered a positive development in terms of incentives—since it penalizes consumers for &quot;dirty&quot; consumption—it fails to achieve the polluter pays principle and would instead aggravate &quot;economic injustice.&quot; Hahnel, therefore, recommends that pollution taxes be linked to cuts in regressive taxes such as social security taxes.

Hahnel is also critical of the mainstream assumption that externalities are anomalous and, on the whole, insignificant to market efficiency; he asserts instead that externalities are prevalent—the rule rather than the exception—and substantial.

Ultimately, Hahnel argues that Pigovian taxes, along with associated corrective measures advanced by market economists, fall far short of adequately or fairly addressing externalities. He argues such methods are incapable of attaining accurate assessments of social costs:

Markets corrected by pollution taxes only lead to the efficient amount of pollution and satisfy the polluter pays principle if the taxes are set equal to the magnitude of the damage victims suffer. But because markets are not incentive compatible for polluters and pollution victims, markets provide no reliable way to estimate the magnitudes of efficient taxes for pollutants. Ambiguity over who has the property right, polluters or pollution victims, free rider problems among multiple victims, and the transaction costs of forming and maintaining an effective coalition of pollution victims, each of whom is affected to a small but unequal degree, all combine to render market systems incapable of eliciting accurate information from pollution victims about the damages they suffer, or acting upon that information even if it were known.

=== Class and hierarchy ===
Although parecon falls under left-wing political tradition, it is designed to avoid the creation of powerful intellectual elites or the rule of a bureaucracy, which is perceived as the major problem of the economies of the communist states of the 20th century. In their book &quot;Looking Forward&quot; Albert and Hanhel termed this situation &#x27;coordinatorism&#x27;. Parecon advocates recognize that monopolization of empowering labor, in addition to private ownership, can be a source of class division. Thus, a three-class view of the economy (capitalists, coordinators, and workers) is stressed, in contrast to the traditional two-class view of Marxism. The coordinator class, emphasized in parecon, refers to those who have a monopoly on empowering skills and knowledge, and corresponds to the doctors, lawyers, managers, engineers, and other professionals in present economies. Parecon advocates argue that, historically, Marxism ignored the ability of coordinators to become a new ruling class in a post-capitalist society.

===Innovation===
Hahnel has also written a detailed discussion of parecon&#x27;s desirability compared to capitalism with respect to incentives to innovate. In capitalism, patent laws, intellectual property rights and barriers to market entry are institutional features that reward individual innovators while limiting the use of new technologies. Hahnel notes that, in contrast, &quot;in a participatory economy all innovations will immediately be made available to all enterprises, so there will never be any loss of static efficiency.&quot;.

== Criticism ==

The market socialist David Schweickart suggests participatory economics would be undesirable even if it was possible:

It is a system obsessed with comparison (Is your job complex more empowering than mine?), with monitoring (You are not working at average intensity, mate—get with the program), with the details of consumption (How many rolls of toilet paper will I need next year? Why are some of my neighbors still using the kind not made of recycled paper?)

Other criticism raised by Schweickart include:
* Difficulty with creating balanced job complexes and ensuring they do not suffer from inefficiency.
* A system based on peer evaluation may not work as workers could slack off and there would be little incentive for colleagues to damage their relationships by giving them bad reviews. Alternatively it may cause workers to become suspicious of one another, undermining solidarity.
* A compensation system based on effort would be difficult to measure and would need to be based on an average rating system of effort.
* Parecon&#x27;s compensation system would be overly egalitarian and likely cause resentment among workers who work harder while also discouraging them from putting in extra effort since they will gain no greater compensation.
* Parecon would likely produce an onerous and tiresome requirement to list off all things people want produced, which would likely suffer from uncertainty given people do not always know what they desire, as well as issues with how much information they should be required to supply and complexities with the negotiations required between worker and consumer councils.

Theodore Burczak argues that it would be difficult for others to measure sacrifice in another&#x27;s labor, which is largely unobservable.

=== Planning ===

Participatory economics would create a large amount of administrative work for individual workers, who would have to plan their consumption in advance, and a new bureaucratic class. Proponents of parecon argue that capitalist economies are hardly free of bureaucracy or meetings, and a parecon would eliminate banks, advertising, stock market, tax returns and long-term financial planning. Albert and Hahnel claim that it is probable that a similar number of workers will be involved in a parecon bureaucracy as in a capitalist bureaucracy, with much of the voting achieved by computer rather than meeting, and those who are not interested in the collective consumption proposals not required to attend.

Critics suggest that proposals require consideration of an unfeasibly large set of policy choices, and that lessons from planned societies show that peoples&#x27; daily needs cannot be established well in advance simply by asking people what they want. Albert and Hahnel note that markets themselves hardly adjust prices instantaneously, and suggest that in a participatory economy facilitation boards could modify prices on a regular basis. According to Hahnel these act according to democratically decided guidelines, can be composed of members from other regions and are impossible to bribe due to parecon&#x27;s non-transferable currency. However, Takis Fotopoulos argues that &quot;no kind of economic organisation based on planning alone, however democratic and decentralized it is, can secure real self-management and freedom of choice.&quot;

<text>Tootsie is a 1982 American satirical romantic comedy film directed by Sydney Pollack from a screenplay by Larry Gelbart and Murray Schisgal and a story by Gelbart and Don McGuire. It stars Dustin Hoffman, Jessica Lange, Teri Garr, Dabney Coleman, and Charles Durning. In the film, Michael Dorsey (Hoffman), a talented actor with a reputation for being professionally difficult, runs into romantic trouble after adopting a female persona to land a job.

&quot;Tootsie&quot; was partly inspired from a play written by McGuire in the early 1970s, and was first made into screenplay by Dick Richards, Bob Kaufman, and Robert Evans, in 1979. Richards, who was selected as director, introduced the project to Hoffman, who obtained complete creative control after signing on: revisions to the screenplay and from Richards and his successor, Hal Ashby, being replaced by Pollack caused delays to production, which eventually began in November 1981. Principal photography took place across New York and in New Jersey, with filming locations including Manhattan, Hurley, and Fort Lee. The film&#x27;s theme song, &quot;It Might Be You&quot;, performed by Stephen Bishop, peaked at No. 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

&quot;Tootsie&quot; was theatrically released in the United States on December 17, 1982, by Columbia Pictures. The film grossed $241 million worldwide, becoming the third-highest grossing film of 1982, and received critical acclaim for its humor, Hoffman and Lange&#x27;s performances, dialogue, and social commentary. It was nominated for ten awards at the 55th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won Best Supporting Actress for Lange. In 1998, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
Michael Dorsey is a respected actor, but nobody in New York City wants to hire him because he is a perfectionist and difficult to work with. He makes ends meet by working as a server in a restaurant and teaching acting classes.

After many months without an acting job, Michael hears of an opening on the popular daytime soap opera &quot;Southwest General&quot; from his friend and acting student Sandy Lester, who unsuccessfully auditions for the role of hospital administrator Emily Kimberly. In desperation, and following an argument with his agent, Michael disguises himself as a woman named &quot;Dorothy Michaels&quot; and auditions for &quot;Southwest General&quot; himself, and he is cast as Emily Kimberly. Michael takes the job as a way to raise $8,000 to produce a play by his roommate Jeff Slater, which will star himself and Sandy.

As &quot;Dorothy&quot;, Michael plays Emily Kimberly as a plausible feminist, which surprises the other actors and the crew, who expected &quot;Dorothy&quot; to give a mild-mannered performance, in contrast to the empowered &quot;Gloria Steinem type&quot; suggested in the script. His character quickly becomes a national sensation.

When Sandy catches Michael in her bedroom half undressed because he wants to try on her clothes for ideas for Dorothy&#x27;s wardrobe, he covers up by claiming he wants to have sex with her. Sandy is receptive and they sleep together. Exacerbating matters further, Michael is attracted to one of his co-stars, Julie Nichols, a single mother with a daughter from a previous relationship and in an unhealthy relationship with the show&#x27;s amoral, sexist director, Ron Carlisle.

At a party, when Michael (as himself) approaches Julie with a pick-up line to which she had previously told &quot;Dorothy&quot; she would be receptive, she throws a drink in his face. Later, as Dorothy, when he makes tentative advances, Julie (having just ended her relationship with Ron per Dorothy&#x27;s advice) makes it known that she is not a lesbian.

Meanwhile, Dorothy has her own admirers to contend with: older cast member John Van Horn and Julie&#x27;s widowed father, Les. Les proposes marriage, insisting that Dorothy think about it before answering. When Michael returns home, he finds John, who almost forces himself on Dorothy until Jeff walks in on them. A few minutes later, Sandy arrives, asking why he has not answered her calls. Michael admits he is in love with another woman, and Sandy screams and breaks up with him.

The tipping point comes when, due to Dorothy&#x27;s popularity, the show&#x27;s producers want to extend her contract for another year. Michael extricates himself when a technical problem forces the cast to perform live, by improvising a revelation about Emily: that she is actually Edward, Emily&#x27;s twin brother who took her place to avenge her. This allows everybody a way out, but Julie is so outraged at Michael&#x27;s deception that she punches him in the stomach once the cameras have stopped rolling and storms off.

Some weeks later, Michael is moving forward with producing Jeff&#x27;s play. He returns Les&#x27;s engagement ring, and Les says, &quot;The only reason you&#x27;re still living is because I never kissed you.&quot; Despite his anger, Les admits that Michael was good company as Dorothy, and Michael buys him a beer.

Michael later waits for Julie outside the studio. She is reluctant to talk to him, but he tells her that he and her father played pool and had a good time. She finally admits she misses Dorothy. Michael tells her Dorothy is within him and he misses her too. He remarks, &quot;I was a better man with you as a woman than I ever was with a woman as a man.&quot; Julie forgives him and they walk away together, engaged in conversation.

==Cast==
==Production==
In the 1970s, fashion company executive Charles Evans began filmmaking, following in the path of his brother Robert Evans, a successful actor, producer and studio executive, &quot;because I enjoy movies very much. I have the time to do it. And I believe if done wisely, it can be a profitable business.&quot; In the early 1970s, Don McGuire&#x27;s &quot;Would I Lie to You?&quot;, a play about an unemployed male actor who cross-dresses in order to find jobs, was shopped around Hollywood for several years until it came to the attention of comedian and actor Buddy Hackett in 1978. Interested in playing the role of the talent agent, Hackett showed Evans the script, and Evans purchased an option on the play. Delays in the film&#x27;s production forced Evans to renew the option, but in 1979, he cowrote a screenplay based on the play with director Dick Richards and screenwriter Bob Kaufman. A few months into the process, Richards shared the screenplay with Dustin Hoffman, his partner in a company that bought and developed film-development properties. Hoffman wanted complete creative control and Evans agreed to remove himself from screenwriting tasks, instead becoming a producer of the film, which was retitled &quot;Tootsie.&quot; Before Hoffman officially became involved, his role had been offered to Peter Sellers and Michael Caine.

The film remained in development for another year as producers waited for a revised script. As preproduction began, the project experienced additional delays when Richards left as director over &quot;creative differences&quot;. He instead became one of the film&#x27;s producers, and Hal Ashby became the director. Columbia then forced Ashby to quit because of the threat of legal action that would ensue if his postproduction commitments on &quot;Lookin&#x27; to Get Out&quot; were not fulfilled. Hoffman, in an attempt to get the interest of Sydney Pollack to direct, asked Elaine May, who provided a few weeks of work that added the character played by Murray to go along with suggesting Garr for a key role. May, alongside other writers who lent suggestions (such as Barry Levinson), albeit uncredited.
 In November 1981, Sydney Pollack agreed to direct and produce the film at Columbia&#x27;s suggestion.

Hoffman suggested that Pollack play Michael&#x27;s agent George Fields, a role written for Dabney Coleman. Pollack resisted the idea, but Hoffman eventually convinced him; it was Pollack&#x27;s first acting work in years. Pollack cast Coleman as the sexist, arrogant soap opera director Ron Carlisle.

To prepare for his role, Hoffman watched the 1978 film &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot; several times. He also visited the set of &quot;General Hospital&quot; for research and conducted extensive makeup tests. Hoffman has stated that he was shocked to learn that although makeup could be used to allow him to credibly appear as a woman, he would never be a beautiful one. His epiphany occurred when he realized that although he found Dorothy interesting, he would not have spoken to her at a party because she was not beautiful, and because of this, he had missed the opportunity for many conversations with interesting women. He concluded that he had never regarded &quot;Tootsie&quot; as a comedy.

Scenes set at New York&#x27;s Russian Tea Room were filmed in the actual restaurant, with additional scenes shot in Central Park and in front of Bloomingdale&#x27;s. Scenes were also filmed in Hurley, New York and at the National Video Studios in New York. Additional filming took place in Fort Lee, New Jersey.

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;Tootsie&quot; opened in 943 theaters in the United States and Canada and grossed $5,540,470 during its opening weekend. After 115 days, it surpassed &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; as Columbia&#x27;s greatest domestic hit of all time. Its final international gross in the United States and Canada was $177,200,000, making it the second-highest-grossing movie of 1982 after &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold more than 56.9 million tickets in the U.S.

The film grossed $63.8 million internationally and was the highest-grossing film in Germany, with a gross of $19 million. Worldwide, it grossed 241 million dollars.

===Critical response===

Roger Ebert praised the film, awarding it four out of four stars and observing: &quot;&quot;Tootsie&quot; is the kind of Movie with a capital M that they used to make in the 1940s, when they weren&#x27;t afraid to mix up absurdity with seriousness, social comment with farce, and a little heartfelt tenderness right in there with the laughs. This movie gets you coming and going...The movie also manages to make some lighthearted but well-aimed observations about sexism. It also pokes satirical fun at soap operas, New York show business agents and the Manhattan social pecking order.&quot;

===Accolades===
In 2011, ABC aired a primetime special, &quot;Best in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time&quot;, that counted down the best movies chosen by fans based on results of a poll conducted by both ABC and &quot;People Weekly Magazine&quot;. &quot;Tootsie&quot; was selected as the 5 Best Comedy.

<doc id="76395" wikidata="Q2186143" url="?curid=76395" title="Topaz (1945 film)">
<text>Topaz is a 1945 documentary film, shot illegally by internee Dave Tatsuno (1913–2006), (though with the assistance of members of the camp staff), which documented life at the Topaz War Relocation Center in Utah during World War II. Tatsuno went through a unique and challenging filming process in order to produce his movie due to lack of freedom within the internment camps that hindered his ability to film his experiences.

The film was deemed &quot;culturally significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress in 1996, and was the second amateur film ever selected for the National Film Registry (after the &quot;Zapruder&quot; film of the JFK assassination).

== Production ==
Between 1943 and 1945, Dave Tatsuno was incarcerated in a Japanese internment camp called Topaz War Relocation Center located in Millard County, Utah. During this time, he filmed his documentary with an 8mm home movie camera that he acquired in 1936. During WWII, cameras were considered contraband for Japanese Americans and were to be surrendered to the government. To avoid this confiscation, Tatsuno gave his camera to his friend claiming &quot;you can&#x27;t turn in something you don&#x27;t have&quot;.

During his time at the camp, Tatsuno began to manage a dry goods co-op. Tatsuno always credited his store supervisor, Walter Honderick, for helping him get the movie camera into the camp. They arranged for the camera to be mailed to the supervisor to avoid inspection, and the supervisor gave Tatsuno the camera warning him, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t get too closed to the [barbed wire] fence.&quot; Because of his role and previous experience in retail, Tatsuno was selected to do various merchandise runs, which allowed for him to travel outside of the camp and across the country. He estimates that he traveled 20,000 miles during his time doing these runs. It was during this supply trips that Tatsuno was able to purchase 8 mm color film for his camera, which he used to film his experience in the camp. In order to develop the film, he would send it out to Salt Lake City, and from there he would have it sent to his brother, who was attending the University of Utah.

== Filming process ==
During his time at the camp, Tatsuno filmed things like his new-born daughter, friends chatting after a church service, his father and son walking through the snow, girls attempting to escape a dust storm, and a teenager skating on a makeshift ice rink. These moments he captured represented the persistence of community through rough conditions. Because of Honderick&#x27;s warning, the images and shots do not include that of watch towers, guards, and anywhere close to the barbed wire fence surrounding the complex.

In 1990, Tatsuno discussed part of his process for making the film by writing, &quot;When viewing these home-movies, there are several things to keep in mind: 1) These films were taken secretly. Since I was afraid to take many shots in fear of being discovered, you will not see scenes of the guards and sentry at the gate, the barbed wire fences, sentry watchtowers, etc. 2) These films are in color. They tend to make the scene more colorful than the bleak, dusty and arid wasteland it actually was. 3) These are homemovies. As I was merely a hobbyist who enjoyed taking home-movies, these films were taken without the intent of being documentaries. As a result, I focused on family and friends. …The camera shots, thus, do not fathom the emotions hidden within the evacuees - the fear, the loneliness, the despair and the bitterness that we felt.&quot; While images appear to show the internees happy and enjoying their lives, Tatsuno said that they were &quot;hamming it up&quot; for the camera, hiding their sorrow.

== Legacy ==
In 1996, &quot;Topaz&quot; was elected into the National Film Registry that contains films that are to be maintained and preserved in the Library of Congress. There is a version of &quot;Topaz&quot; that runs forty-eight minutes long, is in color, and may not feature any of Tatsuno&#x27;s commentary. There is another version that is open to the public, is in black and white, includes Tatsuno&#x27;s commentary, and runs for about eighty minutes that can be viewed here.

<doc id="76396" wikidata="Q2033326" url="?curid=76396" title="William Stokoe">
<text>William Clarence “Bill” Stokoe Jr. ( ; July 21, 1919 – April 4, 2000) was an American linguist and a long-time professor at Gallaudet University. His research on American Sign Language (ASL) revolutionized the understanding of ASL in the United States and sign languages throughout the world. Stokoe&#x27;s work led to a widespread recognition that sign languages are true languages, exhibiting syntax and morphology, and are not only systems of gesture.

== Early life and education ==
William C. Stokoe Jr. was born July 21, 1919, in Lancaster, New Hampshire. Stokoe graduated from Cornell University in 1941, from which he earned his Ph.D. in English in 1946, specializing in medieval literature. From there, he became an instructor of English at Wells College.

==Career==

From 1955 to 1970, he served as a professor and chairman of the English department at Gallaudet University, after being recruited to the position by his friend and former classmate Dean George Detmold. He published &quot;Sign Language Structure&quot; (1960) and co-authored along with Dorothy C. Casterline and Carl G. Croneberg, &quot;A Dictionary of American Sign Language on Linguistic Principles&quot; (1965). The former was the first place the term &quot;American sign language&quot; was ever formally used. (The fully capitalized version: &quot;American Sign Language,&quot; first appeared in the &quot;Buff and Blue&quot; in October 1963.) He also started the academic journal &quot;Sign Language Studies&quot; in 1972, which he edited until 1996. He established Linstok Press, an academic publishing company, to facilitate the journal&#x27;s publication. Stokoe&#x27;s final book, &quot;Language in Hand&quot;, was published in 2001, after his death.

Though the relationship between Stokoe and Gallaudet was not always one of complete support (Gallaudet closed his Linguistics Research Laboratory, wherein he carried out the studies that would lead him to declare ASL a fully formed and legitimate language, in 1984, after he retired), the university awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1988.

==Sign language research==

Stokoe researched American Sign Language (ASL) extensively while he worked at Gallaudet University. He coined the term cherology, the equivalent of phonology for sign language. However, sign language linguists, of which he was the first, now generally use the term &quot;phonology&quot; for signed languages.

===Notation system===

Stokoe invented a written notation for sign language (now called Stokoe notation) as ASL had no written form at the time. Unlike SignWriting, which was developed later, it is not pictographic, but drew heavily on the Latin alphabet.

Thus the written form of the sign for &#x27;mother&#x27; looks like 
: ͜ 5x  
The &#x27; ͜ &#x27; indicates that it is signed at the chin, the &#x27;5&#x27; that it uses a spread hand (the &#x27;5&#x27; of ASL), and the &#x27;x&#x27; that the thumb &quot;touches&quot; the chin. Stokoe coined the terms &quot;tab&quot;, &quot;dez&quot;, and &quot;sig&quot;, meaning sign location, handshape and motion, to indicate different categories of phonemes in ASL. The Stokoe notation system has been used for other sign languages, but is mostly restricted to linguists and academics (as yet, no notation system for a sign language has gained significant use).

==Legacy==

Through the publication of his work, he was instrumental in changing the perception of ASL from that of a broken or simplified version of English to that of a complex and thriving natural language in its own right with an independent syntax and grammar as functional and powerful as any found in the oral languages of the world. Gil Eastman, a Deaf actor and playwright, recommended that Stokoe be called the &quot;Father of Sign Language linguistics.&quot;

<doc id="76397" wikidata="Q1355169" url="?curid=76397" title="Little Turtle">
<text>Little Turtle () (1747 July 14, 1812) was a Sagamore (chief) of the Miami people, who became one of the most famous Native American military leaders. Historian Wiley Sword calls him &quot;perhaps the most capable Indian leader then in the Northwest Territory,&quot; although he later signed several treaties ceding land, which caused him to lose his leader status during the battles which became a prelude to the War of 1812. In the 1790s, Mihšihkinaahkwa led a confederation of native warriors to several major victories against U.S. forces in the Northwest Indian Wars, sometimes called &quot;Little Turtle&#x27;s War&quot;, particularly St. Clair&#x27;s defeat in 1791, wherein the confederation defeated General Arthur St. Clair, who lost 900 men in the most decisive loss by the U.S. Army against Native American forces.

== Name ==
Little Turtle is an English translation of &quot;mihšihkinaahkwa&quot; , the phonetic spelling of his name in the Miami-Illinois language. His native name in historic records includes many variations, including Michikinikwa, Meshekunnoghquoh, Michikinakoua, Michikiniqua, Me-She-Kin-No-Quah, Meshecunnaquan, and Mischecanocquah. The word names a species of terrapin, probably the Midland painted turtle. There is no diminutive on this name in the original Miami-Illinois language.

== Early life and physical description ==
There is little documentary evidence for most of Little Turtle&#x27;s life. The exact year and place of his birth are uncertain. Still, sources generally indicate that he was born in 1747 or 1752, the years before or following the period that his parents lived in the Miami village of Pickawillany. Some historians give 1752 as his probable date of birth; others prefer 1747.

The exact names of Little Turtle&#x27;s parents have been long debated. Historian Andrew Cayton named Mishikinakwa (The Turtle) as his father and an unnamed Mohican refugee as his mother; however, Little Turtle biographer Harvey Carter indicated that Little Turtle&#x27;s father was Cinquenackqua.

Little Turtle was born in what became present-day Whitley County, Indiana, at either a small Miami village along Devil&#x27;s Lake or a larger nearby village known as Turtletown (present-day Churubusco, Indiana). Little Turtle lived at Turtletown, along the Eel River, until 1780.

Little Turtle has been described as nearly six feet tall. He disdained drunkenness and presented himself as a serious man. Little Turtle was fond of wearing silver on his ears and clothing.

== Career ==
=== Early years ===

Little Turtle was selected as the war chief of the &quot;Atchatchakangouen&quot; division of the Myaamiaki (Miami people) through his demonstration of military prowess in battle. Although he was the war chief of the leading division of the tribe, Little Turtle was never the head chief of the Miami, which was a hereditary position.

===La Balme&#x27;s Defeat===

Little Turtle earned this designation during the American Revolutionary War in action against a French force allied with the American patriots, led by French military adventurer Augustin de La Balme. After raising a force of forty-to-fifty men at Vincennes, Indiana and a similar number along the Kaskaskia–Cahokia Trail, in October 1780 La Balme plundered Miamitown at Kekionga (present-day Fort Wayne), as part of his campaign to attack the British in Detroit. When La Balme stopped to camp along the Eel River just three miles south of Little Turtle&#x27;s village, Little Turtle received permission to lead an attack. On November 5, 1780, Little Turtle attacked La Balme, killing La Balme and forty of his men and taking the rest prisoner. The battle was a complete rout, and Little Turtle&#x27;s army suffered almost no casualties. Many French soldiers were heard begging to surrender while they were scalped alive. Several French officers were taken alive, three of whom were burnt at the stake, one of whom had his hands and feet cut off before being killed by having his face struck with a tomahawk, and four of whom were let go as a warning to the rest of the French. When French forces allied to the Americans attempted to scout out the location a few days later, they saw that the heads of several French soldiers blocked the path impaled on pikes. After seeing this, they turned back. These events occurred in and around what is today Columbia City, Indiana in Whitley County, Indiana. The victory ended the campaign and established Little Turtle&#x27;s reputation as a war leader. Through the 1780s, Little Turtle continued to lead raids against colonial American settlements in Kentucky, fighting on the side of the British. However, the Miami bands did not uniformly support the British. The Piankashaw Miami supported the rebel Americans, while the Wea Miami vacillated between the British and Americans.

=== Little Turtle&#x27;s War ===
Under the terms of the Treaty of Paris (1783), which ended the American Revolutionary War, the British abandoned their native allies and ceded the land between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River to the U.S. government. (The United States considered this region to be theirs by right of conquest.) Through the Land Ordinance of 1784 and the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, the U.S. government established Northwest Territory in 1787.

Native Americans living in the territory resisted the encroaching American settlements, and violence escalated in the area. Native tribes formed the Northwestern Confederacy to keep the Ohio River as a boundary between Indian lands and the United States. Little Turtle emerged as one of the war leaders of the Confederacy, which also included the Shawnee under Blue Jacket and the Delaware under Buckongahelas. The war with the United States that followed became known as the Northwest Indian War, also called &quot;Little Turtle&#x27;s War&quot;.

Little Turtle helped to lead Native Americans against federal forces led by General Josiah Harmar in late 1790. To end the border war with native tribes in the area, the U.S. government sent an expedition of American troops under the command of General Harmar, but his forces lacked sufficient training and were poorly supplied. (Because the United States had mostly disbanded its military after the American Revolution, it had few professional soldiers to send into battle, a weakness that Little Turtle and other native leaders fully exploited.) In October 1790, Little Turtle and Blue Jacket won two victories against Harmar&#x27;s men. These successes encouraged further resistance. In addition, previously reluctant leaders among the Ottawa and Wyandot joined the confederacy.

In August 1791, Little Turtle&#x27;s daughter was among the women and children who were captured in a raid of a Miami village along the Eel River led by James Wilkinson. By September 1791, a force of 1,400 to nearly 2,000 American soldiers under the command of Arthur St. Clair was moving north from Fort Washington (present-day Cincinnati, Ohio), headed toward the Maumee-Wabash portage.

=== St. Clair&#x27;s defeat ===
Little Turtle is generally credited with leading a coalition force of about 1,000 warriors that routed the U.S. forces near the headwaters of the Wabash River on November 4, 1791. The battle remains the U.S. Army&#x27;s worst defeat by American Indians, with 623 federal soldiers killed and another 258 wounded. The Indian confederacy lost an estimated 100 men. Both Little Turtle and Blue Jacket claimed overall command of the combined native forces in the victory, causing tension within the Confederacy.

In November 1792, following the decision of a grand council of tribal leaders at the mouth of the Auglaize River, Little Turtle led a force of 200 Miami and Shawnee past the U.S. outposts of Fort Jefferson and Fort St. Clair, reaching Fort Hamilton on November 3. The warriors intended to attack the U.S. settlements on the anniversary of St. Clair&#x27;s Defeat. The warriors captured two prisoners and learned that a large convoy of packhorses had left for Fort Jefferson and was due back in the area within days. Little Turtle moved north and found the convoy of nearly 100 horses and 100 Kentucky militia under the command of Major John Adair encamped outside Fort St. Clair. Little Turtle and his warriors attacked at dawn on November 4, just as Adair recalled his sentries. The militia fled into the fort, suffering six killed and four missing, while another five were wounded. Little Turtle&#x27;s force lost two warriors but captured Adair&#x27;s camp and its provisions. All the horses were killed, wounded, or driven off; only 23 were later recovered. Adair considered the battle to be a &quot;triumph&quot; for Little Turtle; James Wilkinson, at that time a lieutenant colonel in command of the U.S. Army at Fort Washington, believed that the loss of the horses made these advanced forts indefensible.

Between 1792 and 1794, General Anthony Wayne commanded the Legion of the United States in a third expedition in the Northwest Territory against the Indian Confederacy. To avoid another defeat, Wayne rigorously trained 3,500 U.S. troops and carefully planned his campaign. The American forces successfully repulsed an exploratory attack on Fort Recovery with an estimated 1,000 warriors on June 1794. Afterwards, Little Turtle counseled his tribesmen to pursue negotiations and peace rather than suffering a defeat in battle, remarking that Wayne was &quot; the chief that never sleeps.&quot;

When Little Turtle was unable to persuade the leaders of the tribal Confederacy to negotiate peace, he stepped down as the intertribal war chief. Little Turtle is said to have ceded command to Blue Jacket, although he retained leadership of his group of Miami tribesmen. Little Turtle&#x27;s son-in-law, William Wells, a white man who was born in Kentucky and lived among the Miami for eight years after his capture in 1784, also sensed the defeat of the Indian alliance and switched his alliance to the Americans. Wells served as a scout for General Wayne&#x27;s troops and later as an Indian Agent for the U.S. government.

=== Battle of Fallen Timbers ===
The Indian Confederacy, numbering around 1,000 warriors, was defeated at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in August 1794 near the Maumee River. After the battle, the Miamis abandoned Kekionga and relocated to other villages along the Eel, Mississinewa, and Wabash Rivers.

Following the Indian Confederacy&#x27;s defeat at Fallen Timbers, their leaders signed the Treaty of Greenville (1795), a turning point in their resistance to American expansion. Little Turtle traveled with his wife to Greenville and gave a speech before signing the treaty. He encouraged his people &quot;to adopt American ways&quot; and hoped the treaty would improve relations between the Americans and Native Americans. His wife died in camp the next day. Her funeral and burial included American soldiers as pallbearers, American music, and a three-gun salute.

Although Indian resistance to the Americans diminished after the Treaty of Greenville was signed, Indian raids continued to threaten settlements along the frontier until 1815. For the remainder of his life, Little Turtle was a committed peacekeeper, causing some to consider him an &quot;accommodationist&quot; who believed that his people would have to adapt to the Americans&#x27; way of life if they hoped to endure.

== Later years ==

After the defeat of the Western Confederacy at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794 and signing the Treaty of Greenville in 1795, Little Turtle refused an alliance with the Shawnee chief Tecumseh. Little Turtle continued to advocate for peace and accommodation instead of conflicts. He also began to adapt to United States cultural habits, including the acquisition of his land but remained adamant in his opposition to alcohol consumption. Little Turtle made multiple trips east to meet with three U.S. presidents, although he refused to travel with Blue Jacket. He accepted annuity payments, other rewards, and enslaved African Americans in exchange for his cooperation.

The United States more highly regarded Little Turtle than Blue Jacket. He was recommended to President George Washington by General James Wilkinson, and in November 1796, Little Turtle met with President George Washington, who presented him with a ceremonial sword. On this trip he also met Comte de Volney. One account of the trip states that on his way to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to meet the president, Little Turtle met General Tadeusz Kościuszko, who presented him with a matching pair of pistols along with instructions to use them on &quot;the first man who ever comes to subjugate you.&quot; In 1797–98, during a second trip east, Little Turtle met with President John Adams.

President Thomas Jefferson also corresponded with Little Turtle to encourage the introduction of American agriculture to Miami society, although it was Moravian missionaries who demonstrate farming methods to native tribes in the White River area and an East Coast Quaker society from Baltimore, Maryland, who sent Philip Dennis to work with tribes in Fort Wayne to establish a model farm. Little Turtle also made two trips to Washington, D.C., in 1801–02 and 1809–09 to meet with President Jefferson. At Little Turtle&#x27;s and other chiefs&#x27; request, Jefferson provided agricultural equipment and livestock to the Miamis and Potawatomis to encourage the tribes to adopt farming. Despite these efforts, among others, most of the attempts at assimilation failed, a contributing factor to the federal government seeking further land cession treaties and the eventual removal of the territory&#x27;s Native American inhabitants from the Northwest Territory.

A lifelong teetotaler, Little Turtle made a personal plea to President Jefferson to prohibit the sale and consumption of alcohol in Native American communities. On 14 January 1802 he delivered a speech to President Thomas Jefferson and members of the US Senate:

Father, nothing can be done to advantage unless the Great Council of the Sixteen Fires, now assembled, will prohibit any person from selling spirituous liquors among their red brothers. The introduction of this poison has been prohibited in our camps but not in our towns, where many of our hunters, for this poison, dispose of, not only their furs, etc., but also their blankets and guns, and return to their families destitute...Owing to the introduction of this fatal poison, we have become less numerous and happy.

Jefferson and members of Congress were impressed with Little Turtle&#x27;s arguments, and on 30 March 1802, Congress passed the revised Indian Nonintercourse Act. This and other federal laws restricting the sale of alcohol to Native Americans remained in effect until 1953.

In 1809, Little Turtle suffered a break with other Miami leaders when William Henry Harrison, governor of the Indiana Territory, came to Fort Wayne to renegotiate treaty terms. Working with Little Turtle and his son-in-law, William Wells, Harrison succeeded in obtaining the Treaty of Fort Wayne (1809), which secured of land for the federal government from the Potawatomi representatives and other tribes who cooperated. Other tribal leaders who opposed Little Turtle, including Pacanne, Jean Baptiste Richardville (Pacanne&#x27;s nephew), Owl, and Metocina, refused to relinquish any more land to the U.S. government. Harrison was forced to recognize the Mississinewa chiefs as the true representatives of the Miamis, not Little Turtle, and to declare that Little Turtle was not a Miami. Although Little Turtle was among the signers of the Treaty of Fort Wayne, afterward, he was &quot;forcibly retired from Miami affairs.&quot; Shawnee war chief Tecumseh and his brother, Tenskwatawa (The Prophet), condemned the treaty and began talks with the British about allying. That alliance was attacked by the United States at the 1811 Battle of Tippecanoe, in which William Well&#x27;s brother fought for the United States while another of Little Turtle&#x27;s sons-in-law, White Loon, fought for Tecumseh&#x27;s Confederacy.

Little Turtle retired to a Miami village twenty miles northeast of Fort Wayne, Indiana. Following the Siege of Fort Wayne during the War of 1812, General Harrison ordered the destruction of all Miami villages within a two-day march of Fort Wayne, an order that may have been in retaliation for the negotiations in 1809. Harrison&#x27;s forces also destroyed the village where Little Turtle resided, but spared Little Turtle&#x27;s home, which the U.S. government had built for his use. The United States defeated the British and their Native American allies at the Battle of the Thames in 1813, destroying the power of the Native American Confederacy. As a result, many Native Americans moved farther west.

== Death and legacy ==
Little Turtle died on July 14, 1812, at the home of his son-in-law William Wells, not far from Kekionga. Little Turtle had been suffering from gout and rheumatism for some time. He was honored with a military-style funeral with full military honors at Fort Wayne. Little Turtle was buried in his ancestral burial ground near Spy Run. Wells was killed one month later at the Battle of Fort Dearborn.

In 1912, Little Turtle&#x27;s grave was accidentally disturbed. His remains were disinterred when workers discovered the burial site during a cellar excavation for a home on Lawton Place in Fort Wayne. Although the plans for the house were altered and Little Turtle&#x27;s remains were reinterred the objects initially placed in his grave- including the sword from President Washington, the pistols from Kosciusko, and other artifacts- were distributed to collectors and later gathered for public display. The objects were placed in the collection of the Allen County-Fort Wayne Historical Society, and were eventually displayed at the Fort Wayne Old City Hall Building.

Little Turtle&#x27;s legacy was one of initial resistance and cooperation to preserve the lives and future of his people.

== Honors and tributes ==
=== Burial site ===

In 1959, Fort Wayne residents Mary Catherine Smeltzly and her sister, Eleanor Smeltzly, purchased Little Turtle&#x27;s burial site to honor his peacemaking efforts by donating the property to the city as a public park. A bronze plaque attached to a granite boulder erected on the site was dedicated in 1960. In 1994, the memorial was improved with additional markers, and a trust was established for its maintenance.

A small memorial stone placed at Little Turtle&#x27;s gravesite reads:

<doc id="76398" wikidata="Q2873332" url="?curid=76398" title="Trance and Dance in Bali">
<text>Trance and Dance in Bali is a short documentary film shot by the anthropologists Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson during their research on Bali in the 1930s. It shows female dancers with sharp &quot;kris&quot; daggers dancing in trance, eventually stabbing themselves without injury. The film was not released until 1951. It has attracted praise from later anthropologists for its pioneering achievement, and criticism for its focus on the performance, omitting relevant details such as the conversation of the dancers.

== History ==

The anthropologists Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson visited Bali for two years of research in the 1930s, shooting some 22,000 feet of 16-millimetre film and 25,000 photographs, and completing seven films, of which &quot;Trance and Dance in Bali&quot; is one. They were married in 1936. Their output of visual materials has been described as unrivalled in anthropology. This was driven by their method of participant observation, which was intended to be recorded in copious systematic field notes so as to grasp the subject&#x27;s point of view. They paid careful attention to photographic technique, using both still and motion-picture cameras. During their stay, Bateson sent home for additional bulk film, a larger developing tank, and a rapid winder to allow photographs to be taken &quot;in very rapid succession&quot;.

The dance for &quot;Trance and Dance in Bali&quot; was specially arranged during daylight hours, as no lighting equipment was available; the dance was, according to Mead, &quot;ordinarily performed only late at night&quot;. Mead later noted that &quot;The man who made the arrangements decided to substitute young beautiful women for the withered old women who performed at night, and we could record how women who had never before been in trance flawlessly replicated the customary behavior they had watched all their lives&quot;. In this way, Mead justified the changes as part of their anthropological inquiry.

The film, like Bateson and Mead&#x27;s other works, initially received a puzzled welcome. The films became classics, launched the field of visual anthropology, and have &quot;landmark status&quot; with little to compare them to. Most of the footage of &quot;Trance and Dance in Bali&quot; was shot on 16 December 1937 in a performance that they commissioned (on Mead&#x27;s birthday). They referenced their payment for the performance to Balinese cultural patronage. The trance ritual that they filmed was, according to the anthropologist Ira Jacknis, &quot;not an ancient form, but had been created during the period of their fieldwork&quot;, as a Balinese group had in 1936 &quot;combined the Rangda or Witch play (Tjalonarang) with the Barong and kris-dance play, which was then popularized with tourists through the efforts of [the painter] Walter Spies and his friends.&quot;

== Synopsis ==

The film describes and illustrates a single performance of the Kris Dance, a ritual dance on the Indonesian island of Bali. The dance portrays the struggle of good, in the shape of dragons, against evil, in the shape of masked &quot;Tjalonarang&quot; witches. The dancers are young women. They hold &quot;kris&quot; daggers. They are seen to enter trance, one at a time, and are revived from it. While in trance, they dance ecstatically and stab themselves with their daggers, remaining unharmed. 
The film opens and closes with displayed blocks of text, summarizing the dance&#x27;s story.

No sounds were recorded at the time of filming. The film&#x27;s soundtrack consists of narration by Mead, and Balinese music recorded elsewhere, possibly by Bateson and Mead&#x27;s collaborators, the Canadian musicologist Colin McPhee, and the scholar of Balinese dance Katherane Mershon.

== Publication ==

&quot;Trance and Dance in Bali&quot; was filmed in the 1930s, most of it in 1937, and released in 1951. It is written and narrated by Mead, with cinematography by Bateson, and co-directed by Bateson and Mead. The short film is now available for free download.

== Historical significance ==

In 1999 the film was deemed &quot;culturally significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.

The film was &quot;very influential for its time&quot;, according to the anthropologist Jordan Katherine Weynand. She states that it records Balinese people &quot;dancing while going through violent trances, stabbing themselves with daggers without injury. They are then restored to consciousness with holy water and incense.&quot;

The Indonesian American anthropologist Fatimah Tobing Rony argues that the &quot;photogenic&quot; violence and trance are untranslatable: anthropology can look at trance but never really penetrates its mystery. In her view, &quot;the naughty voices of the girls and the vain chuckles of the old women, transcribed by the secretary, are never heard in the voiceover or soundtrack: the women become undifferentiated exotic trancers. And the spiritual depths of the older women are not considered.&quot; As for objectivity, Rony remarks that &quot;The photogenic &quot;Trance and Dance in Bali&quot; is representative of a kind of anthropological imperialist blindness, ironic considering that these scientists believed [in] and promoted the idea of their own superior vision&quot;.

The anthropologist Hildred Geertz calls the film pioneering, writing that Bateson and Mead are more than pathbreakers: their films &quot;remain in certain crucial respects exemplary achievements.&quot; In her view, their films are sophisticated &quot;even by today&#x27;s standards in that they use film not as ethnographic illustration but as a powerful tool in systematic cultural research.&quot; Geertz argues that &quot;Trance and Dance in Bali&quot; sets out a hypothesis about the interconnectedness of cultural experiences of childhood, ritual, and folk drama. The film is a &quot;minute&quot; sample of Mead&#x27;s &quot;incredibly large corpus of visual materials&quot;, now all archived and annotated. Geertz notes, too, that the film is &quot;a highly dramatic and moving presentation of Balinese culture&quot; that words alone could not achieve, even if the Witch-and-Dragon ritual dance had to be shot in daylight &quot;rather than catching it in all its terrifying mystery&quot; at night.

The visual anthropologist Beverly Seckinger notes that the film created a visual record of one performance of the Kris Dance, with the minimum of written and voiced-over narration. She comments that the film was pioneering in focusing on one ritual, rather than attempting to show a whole &quot;culture&quot; (her quotation marks) in one film; and in limiting the amount of narration. She quotes Geertz&#x27;s conclusion that &quot;the
film remains an evocative and striking presentation of the way in which multiple
meanings are condensed within a centrally significant cultural form&quot;. Seckinger remarks that all the same the film is &quot;a product of its time&quot;, with not attempt to have the participants speak for themselves; she notes that without audio equipment, this would have been difficult. Further, the film treats the dancers as typical of Balinese culture, not as individuals, and there is no Balinese voice or quoted Balinese text. Instead, Mead&#x27;s narration &quot;inevitably takes on the character of &#x27;scientific&#x27; authority&quot;.

The hypnotherapists Jay Haley and Madeleine Richeport-Haley describe the film as &quot;a masterpiece of historical importance&quot;. They visited Bali around 50 years after Bateson and Mead, met some of the same people, and created a film with the title &quot;Dance and Trance of Balinese Children&quot;, combining new footage with clips from &quot;Trance and Dance in Bali&quot;.

The scholar of film Trevor Ponech writes that by altering the customary conditions of performance, Bateson and Mead&#x27;s objectivity is open to question, perhaps influenced by their &quot;ethically questionable, lifeworld-distorting desires&quot;.

<text>Trouble in Paradise is a 1932 American pre-Code romantic comedy film directed by Ernst Lubitsch and starring Miriam Hopkins, Kay Francis, and Herbert Marshall. Based on the 1931 play &quot;The Honest Finder&quot; (&quot;A Becsületes Megtaláló&quot;) by Hungarian playwright , the lead characters are a gentleman thief and a lady pickpocket who join forces to con a beautiful woman who is the owner of a perfume company. In 1991, &quot;Trouble in Paradise&quot; was selected for preservation by the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
In Venice, Gaston Monescu (Herbert Marshall), a master thief masquerading as a baron, meets Lily (Miriam Hopkins), a pickpocket posing as a countess. The two fall in love and decide to team up. They leave Venice for Paris. There, Gaston steals a diamond-encrusted purse worth 125,000 francs from Madame Mariette Colet (Kay Francis), owner of the famous perfume manufacturer Colet and Co. When Mariette offers a large reward for its return, Gaston claims it, giving the name of Lavalle.

While claiming the reward, Gaston charms Mariette, and admits to being broke. Mariette hires him as her private secretary. He arranges for Lily to be employed in Mariette&#x27;s office, and stands up to Mariette&#x27;s board of directors, led by Monsieur Adolph J. Giron (C. Aubrey Smith), the manager, who is openly suspicious of him. Having observed Mariette open her private safe (and memorized the combination), Gaston persuades her that she should keep a large sum there, including half of her next dividend installment. Mariette begins to flirt with Gaston, and he begins to have feelings for her.

Unfortunately for the thieves, Mariette has two suitors: the Major (Charles Ruggles), and François Filiba (Edward Everett Horton), who was robbed in Venice by Gaston (posing as a doctor). François sees Gaston at a garden party, and is sure they have met, but can&#x27;t immediately recall where. Fearing imminent discovery, Gaston and Lily decide to flee that night with what is in the safe, and not wait for the dividend installment. Mariette is invited to a dinner party given by the Major. She cannot decide whether to go or to spend the night in bed with Gaston. Eventually she goes, but not before Lily catches on that Gaston has fallen for her rival, and wants to back out of the plan.

At the party, the Major tells François that he once mistook Gaston for a doctor, and François then recalls the Venice incident. François tells Mariette about Gaston, but she refuses to believe it&#x27;s true. Lily robs the safe after confronting her partner. Mariette returns home and suggestively probes Gaston, who admits that the safe has been cleaned out, but claims that he took the cash. He also tells her that Monsieur Giron has stolen millions from the firm over the years.

Lily then confronts Mariette and Gaston, admitting that it was she who stole the money from the safe. She says at first that she doesn&#x27;t want the money—then says she might as well get it in exchange for Gaston, and leaves. Gaston goes after Lily, then returns to say goodbye to Mariette. He tells her that as marvelous as their affair would be, it would end with a policeman coming to arrest them both. As he leaves, Gaston reveals that he took her pearl necklace—which he describes as her gift to Lily—which makes her smile. In the taxi, facing a chilly Lily, Gaston reaches for his present, only to realize she&#x27;s lifted it from his pocket. Lily is at first triumphant, then realizes Gaston has lifted the money from her. This echoes their original meeting, when they first became partners in crime, and she embraces him in delight as the cab rolls away.

==Production==
Working titles for &quot;Trouble in Paradise&quot; included &quot;The Honest Finder,&quot; &quot;Thieves and Lovers,&quot; and &quot;The Golden Widow&quot;; the latter was publicly announced to be the intended release title. As with all the Lubitsch-Raphaelson collaborations, Lubitsch contributed to the writing and Raphaelson contributed ideas to the directing. Lubitsch did not receive screen credit for his writing, and Grover Jones, who was credited with the adaptation, did not contribute significantly: although he was in the room, his credit was based on a contractual obligation, and he did little more than tell stories. Further, although supposedly based on László Aladár&#x27;s 1931 play &quot;The Honest Finder&quot;, Lubitsch suggested that Raphaelson not read the play, and instead the main character, Herbert Marshall&#x27;s master thief, was based on the exploits of a real person, George Manolescu, a Romanian con man whose memoir was published in 1905, and became the basis for two silent films.

Made before effective enforcement of the Production Code, the film is an example of pre-Code cinema containing adult themes and sexual innuendo that was not permitted under the Code. In 1935, when the Production Code was being enforced, the film was not approved for reissue, and it was not seen again until 1968. Paramount was again rejected in 1943, when the studio wanted to make a musical version of the film.

The Art Deco sets for &quot;Trouble in Paradise&quot; were designed by the head of Paramount&#x27;s art department, Hans Dreier, and the gowns were designed by Travis Banton.

==Reception==
&quot;Trouble in Paradise&quot; was the film that first had people talking about &quot;the Lubitsch touch,&quot; and it was, in fact, one of the director&#x27;s favorites. Critic Dwight Macdonald said of the film that it was &quot;as close to perfection as anything I have ever seen in the movies.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; named the film as one of the ten best films of 1932. In 1998, Roger Ebert added it to his Great Movies collection. Wes Anderson and Ralph Fiennes both said the movie was an inspiration for &quot;The Grand Budapest Hotel&quot; (2014). Review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes reports an 89% approval based on 27 critics.

==Awards and honors==
&quot;Trouble in Paradise&quot; was named by the National Board of Review as one of the top 10 films of 1932.

== Preservation ==
&quot;Trouble in Paradise&quot; was preserved and restored by the UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive and The Film Foundation from the 35mm nitrate studio print and a 35 mm acetate dupe negative.
