<text>Lancaster County (; Pennsylvania Dutch: Lengeschder Kaundi), sometimes nicknamed the Garden Spot of America or Pennsylvania Dutch Country, is a county in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 552,984, making it Pennsylvania&#x27;s sixth-most populous county. Its county seat is also Lancaster. Lancaster County comprises the Lancaster metropolitan statistical area. The county is part of the South Central region of the state. Lancaster County is a tourist destination with its Amish community being a major attraction. The ancestors of the Amish began to immigrate to colonial Pennsylvania in the early 18th century to take advantage of the religious freedom offered by William Penn, as well as the area&#x27;s rich soil and mild climate. They were joined by French Huguenots fleeing the religious persecution of Louis XIV. There were also significant numbers of English, Welsh and Ulster Scots (also known as the Scotch-Irish in the colonies).

==History==
The area that became Lancaster County was part of William Penn&#x27;s 1681 charter. John Kennerly received the first recorded deed from Penn in 1691. Although Matthias Kreider was said to have been in the area as early as 1691, there is no evidence that any Europeans settled in Lancaster County before 1710.

Lancaster County was part of Chester County, Pennsylvania, until May 10, 1729, when it was organized as the colony&#x27;s fourth county. It was named after the city of Lancaster in the county of Lancashire in England, the native home of John Wright, an early settler. As settlement increased, six other counties were subsequently formed from territory directly taken, in all or in part, from Lancaster County: Berks (1752), Cumberland (1750), Dauphin (1785), Lebanon (1813), Northumberland (1772), and York (1749). Many other counties were in turn formed from these six.

===Indigenous peoples===
Indigenous peoples had occupied the areas along the waterways for thousands of years, and established varying cultures. Historic Native American tribes in the area at the time of European encounter included the Shawnee, Susquehannock, Gawanese, Lenape (or Delaware), and Nanticoke peoples, who were from different language families and had distinct cultures.

Among the earliest recorded inhabitants of the Susquehanna River valley were the Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannock, whose name was derived from the Lenape term for &quot;Oyster River People&quot;. (The Lenape spoke an Algonquian language.) The English called them the Conestoga, after the name of their principal village, &quot;Gan&#x27;ochs&#x27;a&#x27;go&#x27;jat&#x27;ga&quot; (&quot;Roof-place&quot; or &quot;town&quot;), anglicized as &quot;Conestoga.&quot; Other places occupied by the Susquehannock were &quot;Ka&#x27;ot&#x27;sch&#x27;ie&#x27;ra&quot; (&quot;Place-crawfish&quot;), where present-day Chickisalunga developed, and &quot;Gasch&#x27;guch&#x27;sa&quot; (&quot;Great-fall-in-river&quot;), now called Conewago Falls, Lancaster County.

Other Native tribes, as well as early European settlers, considered the Susquehannock a mighty nation, experts in war and trade. They were beaten only by the combined power of the Five Nation Iroquois Confederacy, after colonial Maryland withdrew its support. After 1675, the Susquehannock were totally absorbed by the Iroquois. A handful were settled at &quot;New Conestoga,&quot; located along the south bank of the Conestoga River in Conestoga Township of the county. They helped staff an Iroquois consulate to the English in Maryland and Virginia (and later, Pennsylvania). By the 1720s, the colonists considered the Conestoga Indians as a &quot;civilized&quot; or &quot;friendly tribe,&quot; having been converted in large part to Christianity, speaking English as a second language, making brooms and baskets for sale, and naming children after their favorite neighbors.

The outbreak of Pontiac&#x27;s War in the summer of 1763, coupled with the ineffective policies of the provincial government, aroused widespread settler suspicion and hatred against all Indians in the frontier counties, without distinguishing among hostile and friendly peoples. On December 14, 1763, the Paxton Boys, led by Matthew Smith and Capt. Lazarus Stewart, attacked Conestoga, killing the six Indians present, and burning all the houses. Officials sheltered the tribe&#x27;s fourteen survivors in protective custody in the county jail, but the Paxton Boys returned on December 27, broke into the jail, and massacred the remaining natives. The lack of effective government control and widespread sympathy in the frontier counties for the murderers meant they were never discovered or brought to justice.

===Maryland-Pennsylvania boundary dispute===

Pennsylvania had a longstanding dispute with Maryland about the southern border of the province and Lancaster County. Nine years of armed clashes accompanied the Maryland-Pennsylvania boundary dispute, which began soon after the 1730 establishment of Wright&#x27;s Ferry across the Susquehanna River. Lord Baltimore believed that his grant to Maryland extended to the 40th parallel. This was about halfway between present-day Lancaster and the town of Willow Street, Pennsylvania. This line of demarcation would have resulted in Philadelphia being included in Maryland.

New settlers began to cross the Susquehanna. In 1730, the Wright&#x27;s Ferry services were licensed and officially begun. Starting in mid-1730, Thomas Cresap, acting as an agent of Lord Baltimore, began confiscating the newly settled farms near present-day Peach Bottom and Columbia, Pennsylvania, which at the time this was not named but was later called Wright&#x27;s Ferry. Believing he controlled this land under his grant, Lord Baltimore wanted the income from the lands. He believed he had a defensible claim established on the west bank of the Susquehanna River since 1721, and that his demesne and grant extended to forty degrees north. If he allowed Pennsylvanians to settle his lands without reacting, he believed, their squatting would constitute a counter claim.

Cresap established a second ferry in the upper Conejohela downriver from John Wright&#x27;s, near Peach Bottom. He demanded that settlers either move out or pay Maryland for the right-bank lands. Settlers believed they already had rights to these under Pennsylvania grants. Cresap drove off settlers by vandalizing farms and killing livestock; he pushed out settlers from southern York and Lancaster counties. He gave the abandoned lands to his followers. If a follower was arrested by Lancaster authorities, the Marylanders would break him out of the lockup.

Lord Baltimore negotiated a compromise in 1733, but Cresap ignored it and continued his raids. A deputy was sent to arrest him in 1734, and Cresap killed him at the door. The Pennsylvania governor demanded that Maryland arrest Cresap for murder; the Maryland governor instead commissioned him as a captain in the militia. In 1736, Cresap was finally arrested; he was jailed until 1737 when the King intervened. In 1750, a court decided that, by failing to develop the land with settlers, Lord Baltimore had forfeited his rights to a twenty-mile (32Â km) swath of land. In 1767, a new Pennsylvania-Maryland border was officially established by the Mason-Dixon line.

===Diversity of settlers===

The names of the original Lancaster County townships reflect the diverse national origins of settlers in the new county: two had Welsh names (Caernarvon and Lampeter), three had Native American names (Cocalico, Conestoga and Peshtank or Paxton), six were English (Warwick, Lancaster, Martic, Sadsbury, Salisbury and Hempfield); four were Irish (Donegal, Drumore, Derry, and Leacock), reflecting mostly Scots-Irish (or Ulster Scots) from Ulster, a province in the north of Ireland; Manheim was German, Lebanon came from the Bible, a basis of all the European cultures; and Earl was a translation of the German surname of Graf or Groff.

===19th-century statesmen===
Lancaster County&#x27;s native son James Buchanan, a Democrat, was elected as the 15th President of the United States in 1856, the first Pennsylvania native to hold the presidency. His home Wheatland is now operated as a house museum in Lancaster.

Thaddeus Stevens, the noted Radical Republican, represented Lancaster County in the United States House of Representatives from 1849 to 1853 and from 1859 until his death in 1868. Stevens left a $50,000 (~$1,000,000 in ) bequest to establish an orphanage. This property eventually was developed as the state-owned Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology. Stevens and Buchanan were both buried in Lancaster.

===Slavery and the Christiana incident===

Pennsylvania passed its gradual abolition law in 1780. The law, which freed the children of duly registered enslaved women at the age of twenty-eight, was a compromise between anti-slavery conviction and respect for white property rights. By the time the U.S. Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, Pennsylvania was effectively a free state, although it did not formally abolish slavery completely until the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment. It did, however, pass a personal liberty law in 1847 that made it difficult for southerners to recover any enslaved persons who made their way into Pennsylvania.

Lying just north of the Mason-Dixon line and bordered by the Susquehanna River, which had been a traditional route from the Chesapeake Bay watershed into the heart of what became Pennsylvania, Lancaster County was a significant destination of the Underground Railroad in the antebellum years. Many residents of German descent opposed slavery and cooperated in aiding fugitive slaves. Local Lancaster County resident Charles Spotts found 17 stations. They included hiding places with trap doors, hidden vaults, a cave, and one with a brick tunnel leading to Octoraro Creek, a tributary of the Susquehanna.

As a wealthy Maryland wheat farmer, Edward Gorsuch had manumitted several slaves in their 20s. He allowed his slaves to work for cash elsewhere during the slow season. Upon finding some of his wheat missing, he thought his slaves had sold it to a local farmer. His slaves Noah Buley, Nelson Ford, George Ford, and Joshua Hammond, fearing his bad temper, fled across the MasonâDixon line to the farm of William Parker, a mulatto free man and abolitionist who lived in Christiana, Pennsylvania. Parker, 29, was a member of the Lancaster Black Self-Protection Society and known to use violence to defend himself and the fugitive slaves who sought refuge in the area.

Gorsuch obtained four warrants and organized four parties, which set out separately with federal marshals to recover his propertyâthe four slaves. He was killed and others were wounded. While Gorsuch was legally entitled to recover his slaves under the Fugitive Slave Act, it is not clear who precipitated the violence. The incident was variously called the &quot;Christiana Riot&quot;, &quot;Christiana Resistance&quot;, the &quot;Christiana Outrage&quot;, and the &quot;Christiana Tragedy&quot;. The Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society helped provide defense for the suspects charged in the case.

The event frightened slaveholders, as black men not only fought back but prevailed. Some feared this would inspire enslaved blacks and encourage rebelliousness. The case was prosecuted in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia under the Fugitive Slave Act, which required citizens to cooperate in the capture and return of fugitive slaves. The disturbance increased regional and racial tensions. In the North, it added to the push to abolish slavery.

In September 1851, the grand jury returned a &quot;true bill&quot; (indictment) against 38 suspects, who were held at Moyamensing Prison in Philadelphia, awaiting trial. U.S. District Judge Robert Cooper Grier ruled that the men could be tried for treason.

The only person actually tried was Castner Hanway, a European-American man. On November 15, 1851, he was tried for liberating slaves taken into custody by U.S. Marshal Kline, as well as for resisting arrest, conspiracy, and treason. Hanway&#x27;s responsibility for the violent events was unclear. He was reported as one of the first on the scene where Gorsuch and others of his party were attacked, and he and his horse provided cover for Dickerson Gorsuch and Dr. Pearce, who were wounded. The jury deliberated 15 minutes before returning a &quot;Not Guilty&quot;. Among the five defense lawyers, recruited by the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society, was U.S. Congressman Thaddeus Stevens, who had practiced law in Lancaster County since at least 1838.

===Religious history===
The oldest surviving dwelling of European settlers in the county is that of Mennonite Bishop Hans Herr, built in 1719. In 1989, Donald Kraybill counted 37 distinct religious bodies/organizations, with 289 congregations and 41,600 baptized members, among the plain sects who are descendants of the Anabaptist Mennonite immigrants to Lancaster County. The Mennonite Central Committee in Akron supports relief in disasters and provides manpower and material to local organizations in relief efforts.

The town of Lititz was originally planned as a closed community, founded early in the 1740s by members of the Moravian Church. The town eventually grew and welcomed its neighbors. The Moravian Church established Linden Hall School for Girls in 1746; it is one of the earliest educational institutions in continuous operation in the United States.

In addition to the Ephrata Cloister, the United Brethren in Christ and the Evangelical United Brethren (EUB) trace their beginnings to a 1767 meeting at the Isaac Long barn, near the hamlet of Oregon, in West Lampeter Township. The EUB, a German Methodist church, merged in 1968 with the traditionally English Methodist Episcopal Church to become the United Methodist Church.

The first Jewish resident was Isaac Miranda , from the Sephardic Jewish community of London, who owned property before the town and county were organized in 1730. Ten years later several Jewish families had settled in the town; on February 3, 1747, a deed to Isaac Nunus Ricus (Henriques) and Joseph Simon was recorded, conveying of land &quot;in trust for the society of Jews settled in and about Lancaster,&quot; to be used as a place of burial. This cemetery is still used by Congregation Shaarai Shomayim; it is considered the nation&#x27;s fourth-oldest Jewish cemetery.

As of 2010, Lancaster County is home to three synagogues: the Orthodox Degel Israel; the Conservative Beth El; and the Reform Shaarai Shomayim. In 2003 Rabbi Elazar Green &amp; Shira Green founded the Chabad Jewish Enrichment Center, a branch of the Chabad Lubavitch movement, that focuses on serving the Jewish students of Franklin and Marshall College, as well serving the general community with specific religious services. The Lancaster Mikvah Association runs a mikveh on Degel Israel&#x27;s property. Central PA Kosher Stand is operated at Dutch Wonderland, a seasonal amusement park.

This area was also settled by French Huguenots, who had fled to England and then the colonies in the late 1600s and early 1700s to escape Catholic persecution in France. Isaac LeFÃ¨vre and a group of other Huguenots settled in the Pequea Creek area.

===Inventions===

* Fraktur, the artistic and elaborate 18th- century and 19th-century hand-illuminated folk art inspired by German blackface type, originated at Johann Conrad Beissel&#x27;s cloister of German Seventh Day Baptists in Ephrata.
* The first battery-powered watch, the Hamilton Electric 500, was released in 1957 by the Hamilton Watch Company.
* The Pennsylvania Long Rifle, otherwise known as the &quot;Kentucky&quot; (Long) Rifle.
* The Conestoga wagon, which started the US practice of opposing vehicles passing each other to the right.
* The Stogie cigar &quot;Stogie&quot; is shortened from &quot;Conestoga&quot;.
* The Amish quilt, a highly utilitarian art form, dates from 1849 in Lancaster County.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (4.1%) is water.

===Climate===
Most of the county has a hot-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dfa&quot;) and the hardiness zones are 6b and 7a. The most recent temperature averages show areas along the Susquehanna River and in the lower Conestoga Valley to have a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;.)
===Watersheds===
Almost all of Lancaster County is in the Chesapeake Bay drainage basin, via the Susquehanna River watershed (the exception is a small unnamed tributary of the West Branch of Brandywine Creek that rises in eastern Salisbury Township and is part of the Delaware River watershed). The major streams in the county (with percent area drained) are: Conestoga River and Little Conestoga Creek (31.42%); Pequea Creek (15.02%); Chiques Creek (or &quot;Chickies Creek&quot;, 12.07%); Cocalico Creek (11.25%); Octoraro Creek (10.74%); and Conowingo Creek (3.73%).

===Protected areas===
Lancaster County is home to Susquehannock State Park, located on overlooking the Susquehanna River in Drumore Township. One of the three tracts comprising William Penn State Forest, the Cornwall fire tower site, is located in northern Penn Township near the Lebanon County border. The site, with its 1923 fire tower, was acquired by the state in January 1935.

There are six Pennsylvania State Game Lands for hunting, trapping, and fishing located in Lancaster County. They are numbers (with location and area): 46 (near Hopeland, ), 52 (near Morgantown, ), 136 (near Kirkwood, ), 156 (near Poplar Grove, ), 220 (near Reinholds, ), and 288 (near Martic Forge, ).

The county&#x27;s southern portion has some protected serpentine barrens, a rare ecosystem where toxic metals in the soil inhibit plant growth, resulting in the formation of natural grassland and savanna. These barrens include the New Texas Serpentine Barrens, privately owned land managed by The Nature Conservancy, and Rock Springs Nature Preserve, a publicly accessible preserve with hiking trails owned and managed by the Lancaster County Conservancy.

Lancaster County leads the nation in farmland preservation. Organizations such as the Lancaster Farmland Trust, the Lancaster County Agricultural Preservation Board, and multiple municipalities work in partnership with landowners to preserve their farms and way of life for future generations by placing a conservation easement on their property. A conservation easement restricts real estate development, commercial and industrial uses, and certain other activities on the land that are mutually agreed upon by the grantees and the property owner. After ceding their development rights, landowners continue to manage and own their properties and may receive significant tax breaks. The conservation easement ensures that the land will remain available for agricultural use forever. Lancaster Farmland Trust is a private, non-profit organization that works closely with the vast Amish and Plain-Sect communities of Lancaster County to ensure their farms will retain their agricultural value. Together with the Lancaster County Agricultural Preserve Board, the county has preserved more than of preserved farmland in the countyâa first in the nation.

===Seismicity===
Lancaster County lies on the general track of the Appalachian Mountains. As a result, residual seismic activity from ancient faulting occasionally produces minor earthquakes of magnitude 3 to 4. On December 27, 2008, a 3.3 magnitude earthquake was widely felt in the Susquehanna Valley but caused no damage to structures.

==Flora and fauna==
The bog turtle was first discovered and identified in Lancaster County by botanist Gotthilf Heinrich Ernst Muhlenberg, who discovered the turtle species while surveying the area&#x27;s flora. The species was named Muhlenberg&#x27;s tortoise in 1801, but renamed bog turtle, its present common name, in 1956.

===2020 census===
===Plain Anabaptist (Amish) groups===
Lancaster County Anabaptist community founded in c. 1760, has the world&#x27;s largest Amish settlement, with 37,000 people in 220 church districts in 2017, or about 7% of the county&#x27;s population. By 2021 the Amish population increased to almost 42,000. The Lancaster Amish affiliation is relatively liberal concerning the use of technologies compared to other Amish affiliations.

Historically speaking, the Amish population in 1970 numbered only about 7,000; that climbed to about 12,400 by 1990 and 16,900 by 2000. It has doubled since then.

Lancaster also hosts other Plain Anabaptist groups. As of 2000, there are about 3,000 Old Order Mennonites of the Groffdale Conference who drive black top buggies instead of the grey top buggies of the Amish in Lancaster County. Other buggy-using Old Order Mennonites in Lancaster County are subgroups of the Stauffer Mennonites with 283 baptized members and the Reidenbach Mennonites with 232. There are about 4,000 members of the car-driving Weaverland Old Order Mennonite Conference. A congregation of 83 members of the Old Order River Brethren lives there as well as 84 members of the Reformed Mennonite Church who have retained the most conservative form of Plain dress of all Plain groups. There are 74 members of the Old German Baptist Brethren in Lancaster County.

===Religion===

* Eastern Orthodox Christian: 0.3%
* Other: 1.1%
* Unaffiliated: 50.9%

===Dialect===
Some County residents speak with a Pennsylvania Dutch-influenced dialect. This is most common in the Lancaster, Lebanon, York, and Harrisburg areas, and incorporates influences from the Pennsylvania Dutch in dialect and in nomenclature.

==Metropolitan statistical area==
The U.S. Office of Management and Budget has designated Lancaster County as the Lancaster, PA Metropolitan Statistical Area. With a population of 552,984 as of the 2020 U.S. census, the Lancaster, PA metropolitan area is the sixth most populous metropolitan area in Pennsylvania, after the Delaware Valley, Greater Pittsburgh, the Lehigh Valley, the HarrisburgâCarlisle metropolitan statistical area, and the Wyoming Valley.

On a national level, the Lancaster, PA metropolitan area is the 104th most populous metropolitan statistical area as of the 2020 census and the 102nd most populous primary statistical area in the United States as of the 2010 census.

==Government and politics==
===Political party affiliation===














Lancaster County was the home of the final pre-American Civil War U.S. President, James Buchanan, a Democrat. Since the Civil War, however, Lancaster County has been a Republican stronghold. The GOP controls the vast majority of county and municipal elected offices in Lancaster County. Specifically, the row offices and all but one county commission seat are held by Republicans, and the GOP holds all but two state legislative seats covering the county. Republicans also hold a majority of registered voters in the county.

In September 2008, the Democratic Party reached the benchmark of 100,000 registered voters for the first time in the county&#x27;s history. The party had just 82,171 registered Democrats in 2004. , the ratio of Republicans to Democrats in Lancaster County now stands at 1.8 Republicans to 1 Democrat, down from a 3â1 advantage for the Republicans in the late 1990s. Even with these gains, the county is still powerfully Republican downballot; the only real pockets of Democratic influence are in the city of Lancaster. Reflecting this, the only elected Democrats representing a significant portion of the county at the state or federal level hold state house seats anchored in Lancaster city and its closest-in suburbs.

Lancaster County has only ever voted for a Democratic presidential nominee once since James Buchanan in 1856, a resident of the city of Lancaster. In 1964, Lyndon Johnson carried Lancaster County as part of his 44-state landslide, winning by 798 votes, less than a single percentage point. Franklin D. Roosevelt failed to carry the county during any of his four successful runs for president, coming within 4,000 votes of carrying it in his 46-state landslide of 1936. In 2008, Barack Obama became the first Democrat to garner 40 percent of the county&#x27;s vote since Johnson, and the second since Franklin D. Roosevelt. Donald Trump earned 56 percent of the vote in both campaigns, with Joe Biden becoming the third Democrat in 80 years to win 40 percent of the county&#x27;s vote.

According to the Secretary of State&#x27;s office, Republicans hold a majority of the voters in Lancaster County.

==Economy==
In 2021, the county had a per capita personal income (PCPI) of $61,547, 96% of the national average. This reflects a growth of 5.7% from the prior year, versus a 7.3% growth for the nation as a whole. The county poverty rate was 8.8% compared to a national rate of 11.6%.

In 2005, Lancaster County was 10th of all counties in Pennsylvania with 17.7% of its workforce employed in manufacturing; the state averages 13.7%, and the leader, Crawford County, has only 25.1%.

Lancaster County lags in information workers. It ranks 31st in the state with 1.3% of the workforce; the state as a whole employs 2.1% in information technology.

The county ranks 11th in the state in managerial and financial workers, despite having 12.5% of the workforce in those occupations (versus the state average of 12.8%). The state leaders are Chester County with 20.5% and Montgomery County with 18.5%.

With 17.3% working in the professions, Lancaster County is 31st in Pennsylvania,
compared to a state average of 21.5%. Centre County leads with 31.8%, undoubtedly due to Penn State&#x27;s giant footprint in an otherwise rural county, but the upscale Philadelphia suburbs of Montgomery County give them 27.2%.

Lancaster County ranks even lower, 34th, in service workers, with 13.3% of the workforce, compared to a state average of 15.8%. Philadelphia County, leads with 20.5%.

Lancaster County has an unemployment rate of 7.8% as of August 2010. This is a rise from a rate of 7.6% the previous year.

There are 11,000 companies in Lancaster County. The county&#x27;s largest manufacturing and distributing employers at the end of 2003 were Acme Markets, Alumax Mill Products, Anvil International, Armstrong World Industries, Bollman Hat, CNH Global, Conestoga Wood Specialties, Dart Container, High Industries, Lancaster Laboratories, Pepperidge Farm, R R Donnelley &amp; Sons, The Hershey Company, Tyco Electronics, Tyson Foods, Warner-Lambert, and Yellow Transportation.

Auntie Anne&#x27;s, Clipper Magazine, Lancaster Farming, MapQuest, Turkey Hill Dairy, Clair Global, and Wilbur Chocolate Company are Lancaster County-based organizations with an economic footprint of regional or national significance.

Herley Industries is a local producer of microwave and millimeter wave products for the defense and aerospace industries.

===Agriculture===
With some of the most fertile non-irrigated soil in the U.S., Lancaster County has a strong farming industry. Lancaster County&#x27;s 5293 farms, generating $800Â million in food, feed and fiber, are responsible for nearly a fifth of the state&#x27;s agricultural output. Chester County, with its high-value mushroom farms, is second, with $375Â million.

Livestock-raising is responsible for $710Â million of that $800Â million, with dairy accounting for $266Â million, poultry and eggs accounting for $258Â million. Cattle and swine each accounts for about $90Â million.

Agriculture is likely to remain an important part of Lancaster County: almost exactly half of Lancaster County&#x27;s land â â is zoned for agriculture, and of those, are &quot;effective agricultural zoning&quot;, requiring at least per residence.
===Tourism===

Tourism is a significant industry in Lancaster County, employing approximately 20,000. In the 1860s, articles in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; and &quot;Lippincott&#x27;s Magazine&quot; published right after the Civil War, introduced Lancaster County to many readers. However, tourism in Lancaster was nearly non-existent prior to 1955.

A &quot;New York Times&quot; travel article in 1952 brought 25,000 visitors, but the 1955 Broadway musical Plain and Fancy helped to fan the flames of Amish tourism in the mid-1950s. Shortly thereafter, Adolph Neuber (then-owner of the Willows Restaurant) opened the first tourist attraction in Lancaster County showcasing the Amish culture. Lancaster County tourism tapered off, after the 1974 gas rationing and the Three Mile Island incident led to five years of stagnation.

Local tourism officials viewed it as deus ex machina when Hollywood stepped in to rescue their industry. Harrison Ford, in the 1985 movie &quot;Witness&quot;, portrayed a Philadelphia detective who journeys to the Amish community to protect an Amish boy who has witnessed a murder in Philadelphia. The detective is attracted to the boy&#x27;s widowed mother; the movie is less a thriller than a romance about the difficulties faced by an outsider in love with a widow from The Community. The film was nominated for eight Oscars, and won two. However, the real winner was Lancaster County tourism.

Once again, especially after the September 11, 2001 attacks, tourism in Lancaster County has shifted. Instead of families arriving for a three- to four-day stay for a general visit, now tourists arrive for a specific event, whether it be the rhubarb festival, the &quot;maize maze&quot;, to see Thomas the Tank Engine, for Sertoma&#x27;s annual &quot;World&#x27;s Largest Chicken Barbecue&quot; or for the latest show at Sight &amp; Sound Theatres. The tourism industry is discouraged by this change, but not despondent:

The county promotes tourist visits to the county&#x27;s numerous historic and picturesque covered bridges by publishing driving tours of the bridges. With over 200 bridges still in existence, Pennsylvania has more covered bridges than anywhere else in the world, and at 29 covered bridges, Lancaster County has the largest share.

The Lancaster County Convention Center Authority constructed the $170Â million Lancaster County Convention Center in downtown Lancaster on the site of the former Watt &amp; Shand building.

Other tourist attractions include the American Music Theatre, Dutch Wonderland, Ephrata Cloister, Ephrata Fair, Hans Herr House, Landis Valley Museum, Pennsylvania Dutch Country, Pennsylvania Renaissance Faire (one of the largest Renaissance fairs in the world), Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania, Rock Ford plantation, Robert Fulton Birthplace, Sight &amp; Sound Theatres, Strasburg Railroad, Wilbur Chocolate, Wheatland (James Buchanan House) and Sturgis Pretzel House. There are many tours of this historic area including the Downtown Lancaster Walking Tour.

==Transportation==

Lying on the natural route from Philadelphia to the western part of Pennsylvania, Lancaster County has given rise to many improvements in transportation, such as the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike, later part of the Lincoln Highway, in 1794, a canal in 1820, and the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad in 1834.

===Major roads and highways===
===Current railroads===

, passenger service in Lancaster County is provided by Amtrak, whose &quot;Keystone Corridor&quot; passes through the county, with stops at Lancaster, Mount Joy and Elizabethtown. A station is planned at Paradise to provide connecting service with the Strasburg Railroad, which runs passenger excursions from nearby Leaman Place to Strasburg.

The principal freight operator in the county is Norfolk Southern Railway (NS). The NS main line follows the Susquehanna River (with trackage rights for Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR)), and leaves the county by crossing the river on Shocks Mills Bridge near Marietta. NS also has trackage rights over the Keystone Corridor, to which it is connected by the &quot;Royalton Branch&quot;, which runs north along the river from the main line at Marietta, and the &quot;Columbia Branch&quot;, which runs from the Corridor at Dillerville to the main line at Columbia. Two other NS branches originate on the Corridor: the &quot;Lititz Secondary&quot;, which runs from Dillerville to Manheim and ends at Lititz, and the &quot;New Holland Industrial&quot;, which leaves the Corridor around the east end of Lancaster to run east to New Holland and ends at East Earl.

Several short lines also operate in the county. With the exception of the Strasburg Railroad, all are freight railroads. The East Penn Railroad (ESPN) operates on a spur off the NS branch to Manheim, and on a longer line in the northeast corner of Lancaster County into Berks County. Landisville Terminal and Transfer Company (LNTV) operates on a spur off the Amtrak line at Landisville. The Tyburn Railroad operates some trackage around Dillerville. The Columbia and Reading Railway (CORY) began operating on of track in Columbia in January 2010.

<doc id="82190" wikidata="Q1164014" url="?curid=82190" title="List of counties in Utah">
<text>There are 29 counties in the U.S. state of Utah.

In 1849, the provisional State of Deseret established seven counties: Davis, Iron, Sanpete, Salt Lake, Tooele, Utah, and Weber. After the Territory of Utah was created in 1851, the first territorial legislature (1851â1852) acknowledged those seven and created three more: Juab, Millard, and Washington. Over a 40-year period (1854â1894), the Utah Territorial Legislature established most of the counties that exist today. In the early 20th century, after Utah had become a state, the final two counties were created: Duchesne by gubernatorial proclamation (1913) and Daggett by popular vote (1917). Present-day Duchesne County encompassed an Indian reservation that was created in 1861. The reservation was opened to homesteaders in 1905 and the county was created in 1913. Due to dangerous roads, mountainous terrain, and bad weather preventing travel via a direct route, 19th-century residents in present-day Daggett County had to travel on both stage and rail to conduct business in Vernal, the county seat for Uintah County a mere away. In 1917, all Uintah County residents voted to create Daggett County.

Based on 2022 United States Census data, the population of Utah was 3,417,734. Just over 75% of Utah&#x27;s population is concentrated along four Wasatch Front counties: Salt Lake, Utah, Davis, and Weber. Salt Lake County was the largest county in the state with a population of 1,185,813, followed by Utah County with 719,174, Davis County with 373,207 and Weber County with 271,926. Daggett County was the least populated with 992 people. The largest county in land area is San Juan County with and Davis County is the smallest with .

The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, which is used by the United States government to uniquely identify states and counties, is provided with each county. Utah&#x27;s FIPS code is 49, which when combined with any county code would be written as 49XXX. In the FIPS code column in the table below, each FIPS code links to the most current census data for that county.

The Utah Code (Title 17, Chapter 50, Part 5) divides the counties into six classes by population:
* First class: Population of 1,000,000 or more. Only one county - Salt Lake - is first class.
* Second class: Population between 175,000 and 1,000,000. Four counties.
* Third class: Population between 40,000 and 175,000. Five counties.
* Fourth class: Population between 11,000 and 40,000. Ten counties.
* Fifth class: Population between 4,000 and 11,000. Five counties.
* Sixth class: Population below 4,000. Four counties.

The county classes, for example, are used in the Utah legislature in crafting of legislation to distinguish between more urban and rural areas, such as important yet subtle distinctions in how revenue can be distributed. Usually, a bill intended to benefit rural counties would target the counties of the fourth, fifth and sixth class.

Under Utah Code (Title 17, Chapter 52a, Part 2), Utah counties are permitted to choose one of four forms of county government: a three-member full-time commission; a five or seven member expanded commission; a three to nine member (odd-numbered) part-time council with a full-time elected county mayor or a three to nine member (odd-numbered) part-time council with a full-time manager appointed by the council. 23 out of 29 counties are ruled by the standard three-member commission. Of the other six, Cache County was the first change in 1988 to a seven-member council with an elected mayor. Grand County adopted a seven-member council with appointed manager in 1992, followed by Morgan County in 1999 and Wasatch County in 2003. In 1998, Salt Lake County residents approved adopting a nine-member council with elected mayor that began work in 2001. Summit County adopted a five-member council with an appointed manager in 2006.

<text>The U.S. state of Washington has 39 counties. The Provisional Government of Oregon established Vancouver and Lewis Counties in 1845 in unorganized Oregon Country, extending from the Columbia River north to 54Â°40â² north latitude. After the region was organized within the Oregon Territory with the current northern border of 49Â° north, Vancouver County was renamed Clark, and six more counties were created out of Lewis County before the organization of Washington Territory in 1853; 28 were formed during Washington&#x27;s territorial period, two of which only existed briefly. The final five were established in the 22 years after Washington was admitted to the Union as the 42nd state in 1889.

Article XI of the Washington State Constitution addresses the organization of counties. New counties must have a population of at least 2,000 and no county can be reduced to a population below 4,000 due to partitioning to create a new county. To alter the area of a county, the state constitution requires a petition of the &quot;majority of the voters&quot; in that area. A number of county partition proposals in the 1990s interpreted this as a majority of people who voted, until a 1998 ruling by the Washington Supreme Court clarified that they would need a majority of registered voters. No changes to counties have been made since the formation of Pend Oreille County in 1911, except when the small area of Cliffdell was moved from Kittitas to Yakima County in 1970.

King County, home to the state&#x27;s largest city, Seattle, holds almost 30 percent of Washington&#x27;s population (2,271,380 residents of 7,812,880 in 2023), and has the highest population density, with more than 1,000 people per square mile (). Garfield County is both the least populated (2,363) and least densely populated (). Two counties, San Juan and Island, are composed only of islands. The average county is , with 200,330 people.

Seventeen counties have Native Americanâderived names, including nine names of tribes whose land settlers would occupy. Another seventeen were named for political figures, only five of whom had lived in the region. The last five are named for geographic places.

The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, used by the United States government to uniquely identify counties, is provided with each entry. The FIPS code links in the table point to U.S. Census data pages for each county. Washington&#x27;s FIPS state code is 53.

== Governance ==
Counties provide a broad scope of services, including court operation, parks and recreation, libraries, arts, social services, elections, waste collection, roads and transportation, zoning and permitting, as well as taxation. The extent of these vary, and some are administered by municipalities. Counties are not subdivided into minor civil divisions like townships; sub-county local government is only by incorporated cities and towns, as well as by 29 Indian reservations, while unincorporated areas are governed only by the county. There are 242 census county divisions for statistical purposes only.

The default form of county government is the non-charter commission, with three to five elected commissioners serving as both the legislature and executive. Seven counties have adopted charters providing for home rule distinct from state law: King, Clallam, Whatcom, Snohomish, Pierce, San Juan, and Clark. Of these, King, Whatcom, Snohomish, and Pierce, four major counties on Puget Sound, elect a county executive. Councils in the other three charter counties appoint a manager to administer the government. Voters may also elect a clerk, treasurer, sheriff, assessor, coroner, auditor (or recorder), and prosecuting attorney. Elections are nonpartisan in non-charter counties, but charter counties may choose to make some positions partisan, though all elections are by top-two primary.

==List of counties==

== Former county names ==
Four counties changed their name between 1849 and 1925.
* Chehalis County, originally named for the Chehalis people, was renamed Grays Harbor County in 1915.
* Sawamish County, originally named for the Sahewamish Native American tribe, was renamed Mason County in 1864.
* Slaughter County, originally named for Lieutenant William A. Slaughter who was killed during the Indian Wars, was renamed Kitsap County shortly after its formation in 1857. The initial proposals for this county called it Madison County or Kitsap County.
* Vancouver County, originally named for George Vancouver, was renamed Clarke County in 1849 and corrected to Clark in 1925.

== Former counties ==
During Washington&#x27;s territorial period, Washington split off from an Oregon county, three counties were disestablished, and three split into separate territories.
*Clackamas County, Oregon was established in 1844 and included the land south and east of the Columbia River until Washington Territory was formed in 1853, when the area was no longer organized as a county.
*Spokane County was established in Washington Territory in 1858 until it merged into Stevens County in 1864; it was reestablished in 1879.
*Missoula County was established in Washington Territory in 1860 until it split off with the Idaho Territory in 1863.
*Shoshone County, Idaho County, and Nez Perce County were established in Washington Territory in 1861, and Boise County in 1863, until they split off into the Idaho Territory in March 1863, leaving the current borders of Washington.
* Ferguson County, named for Washington legislator James L. Ferguson, was established on January 23, 1863, from Walla Walla County and dissolved on January 18, 1865. Yakima County was established in its place.
* Quillehuyte County was split from Jefferson and Clallam counties in 1868 and returned to those counties a year later before it could be organized.

== Proposed counties ==
Several counties were proposed prior to or during the existence of Washington Territory and nine counties were proposed within the first 16 years of Washington&#x27;s statehood, but none were established.
* The representatives at the Cowlitz Convention of 1851 discussed a proposal to form Columbia Territory, which included a number of new counties in what later became Washington. The next session of the Oregon Territorial Legislature created only one of these counties: Thurston County (which was originally proposed as Simmons County).
* Buchanan County was proposed in 1856 as a division of Clark County.
* Proposed counties during Washington&#x27;s early statehood included Big Bend (1891), Palouse (1891 and 1903), Sherman (1891), Washington (1891), Wenatchee (1893), McKinley (1903), Steptoe (1903), and Coulee (1905).

* Since the 1990s, there have been several proposals for county secession in Washington, largely from rural areas in the major counties of Western Washington. Cedar, Freedom, and Skykomish counties submitted petitions to secede from King and Snohomish counties in 1995 and 1996, with some support in the state legislature to put them to a public referendum.

<text>A lace card (also called a whoopee card, ventilator card, flyswatter card, or IBM doily) is a punched card with all holes punched. They were mainly used as practical jokes to cause disruption in card readers. Card readers tended to jam when a lace card was inserted, as the resulting card had insufficient structural integrity to avoid buckling inside the mechanism. Card punchers could also jam trying to produce cards with all holes punched, owing to power-supply problems. When a lace card was fed through the reader, a card knife or card saw (a flat tool used with punched card readers and card punches) was needed to clear the jam.

<text>The Church of the Brethren is an Anabaptist Christian denomination in the Schwarzenau Brethren tradition ( &quot;Schwarzenau New Baptists&quot;) that was organized in 1708 by Alexander Mack in Schwarzenau, Germany during the Radical Pietist revival. The denomination holds the New Testament as its only creed. Historically, the church has taken a strong stance for nonresistance or Christian pacifismâit is one of the three historic peace churches, alongside the Mennonites and Quakers. Distinctive practices include believer&#x27;s baptism by forward trine immersion; a threefold love feast consisting of feet washing, a fellowship meal, and communion; anointing for healing; and the holy kiss. Its headquarters are in Elgin, Illinois, United States.

The first Brethren congregation was established in the United States in 1723. These church bodies became commonly known as &quot;Dunkards&quot; or &quot;Dunkers&quot;, and more formally as German Baptist Brethren. The Church of the Brethren represents the largest denomination descended from the Schwarzenau Brethren, adopting this name in 1908. In 1926 there was an exodus of some conservative members of the Church of the Brethren, who formed the Dunkard Brethren Church.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
The history of the Schwarzenau Brethren began in 1708 when a group of eight Christians organized themselves under the leadership of Alexander Mack (1679â1735) into a church and baptized one another in Schwarzenau, Germany, now part of Bad Berleburg in North Rhine-Westphalia. Five men and three women gathered at the Eder (pronounced ey-duhr), a small river that flows through Schwarzenau, to perform baptism as an outward symbol of their new faith. One of the members of the group first baptized Mack, who then, in turn, baptized the other seven.

They believed that the established European churchesCatholic, Lutheran, and Reformedwere missing the point of true Christianity as taught by Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount, and as revealed in the New Testament and exemplified by the Early Church. After searching for a church that taught New Testament discipleship and finding none in their area, they committed to follow the commands and example of Jesus in their daily lives regardless of the cost. They rejected established state churches, including infant baptism, existing Eucharistic practices, and the use of physical coercion against other humans. The founding Brethren were initially influenced by Radical Pietist understandings of an invisible, nondenominational church of awakened Christians who would fellowship together in purity and love, awaiting Christ&#x27;s return; yet they embraced an Anabaptist understanding of the church as a disciplined faith community that enforced Christian standards of discipleship upon those who chose to join their fellowship. The eight founding members referred to themselves as &quot;brethren,&quot; and New Baptists (). The name alluded to the use of the name &quot;TÃ¤ufer&quot; (Baptists) by the Mennonites. They suffered persecution for their stand, much as the earlier Anabaptists had.

The Brethren soon moved to seek religious freedom in America. They founded the first American congregation on Christmas Day 1723 in Germantown, Pennsylvania, then a village outside Philadelphia. They became known as German Baptist Brethren (although this name was not officially recognized until 1836, when the Annual Meeting called itself &quot;The Fraternity of German Baptist Brethren&quot;). In 1871, the denomination adopted the name, &quot;The German Baptist Brethren Church.&quot; Until the early 20th century, Brethren were colloquially called &quot;Tunkers&quot; or &quot;Dunkers&quot; (from the German for immersionists).

In 1728, Conrad Beissel, a Brethren minister at Conestoga (Lancaster County, Pa.) renounced his association with the Brethren and formed his own group in Ephrata, Pennsylvania. They came to be known as the Ephrata Cloister. Beissel practiced a mystical form of Christianity. He encouraged celibacy, a vegetarian diet, and recognition of Saturday as the Sabbath.
=== Division in the 1880s ===
After the Beissel split, the Brethren split several times because of doctrinal differences. The most traditionalist members emphasized consistency, obedience, and the order of the Brethren. They opposed the use of musical instruments, Sunday schools, revival meetings, and worldly amusements. They promoted plain dress, plain living, and church discipline. The progressives in the church focused on grace and acceptance. They promoted higher education, salaried ministers, Sunday schools, and revivalism. The majority of Brethren held a position between the two extremes.

In 1869 and 1880, a group of Brethren in the Miami Valley of Ohio submitted a petition to Annual Conference to stop liberalization and return to traditional Brethren practices, which they identified with the &quot;primitive&quot; apostolic faith. On both occasions, a more moderate petition was submitted to the delegates. Both times, the Miami Valley group found the rewording unacceptable.

In 1881, they resubmitted their petition to Annual Conference, and it was rejected for violating technical procedure. In November 1881, traditionalist Brethren led by the Miami Valley group met and formally split from the Church of the Brethren to form the Old German Baptist Brethren. They held their first annual meeting in 1882.

At the same time, Henry Holsinger, a leader of the progressives in the church, published writings that some Brethren considered slanderous and schismatic. As a result, he was disfellowshipped from the 1882 annual meeting of the Brethren. He met with other progressives on June 6 and 7, 1883, and together they formed the Brethren Church.

The remaining middle groupâcalled &quot;conservatives&quot;âretained the name German Baptist Brethren. At the Annual Conference of 1908 at Des Moines, Iowa, the name was officially changed to the Church of the Brethren. The Annual Conference justified the name change by citing the predominant use of English in the church, the fact that the name &quot;German Baptist&quot; frustrated mission work, and that it would disassociate the denomination from the Old German Baptist Brethren.

=== 20th century ===
During the early 20th century, the Church of the Brethren invested heavily in foreign missions in India, China, and other nations. They also embraced the American temperance movement.

The denomination&#x27;s two-hundred year old peace position was tested when delegates at the Goshen Conference in Goshen, Indiana, adopted the 1918 Statement on War and Violence nine months after the United States entered the war to address the issue of conscientious objectors. In July of that year, leaders of the conference were threatened with punishment by the US government under the Sedition Act. The church leaders agreed not to retract the statement, but to withdraw it from circulation.

Discipline for violating church teachings during the church&#x27;s first two hundred years ranged from setting members &quot;back&quot; from communion to disfellowshipping them as members to, in rare cases, &quot;avoidance&quot; (or shunning). These practices gradually subsided as the earlier emphasis upon unity of practice (the &quot;order of the Brethren&quot;) gave way during the 1920s and 1930s to an emphasis upon individual moral autonomy. Martin Grove Brumbaughâa Brethren minister and historian who became governor of Pennsylvania in 1915âplayed a leading role in disseminating a more progressive vision of Brethren history and practice. His questionable claim that &quot;no force in religion&quot; had been a Brethren teaching since their founding reinforced his calls to relax church discipline. These changes led to an exodus of many conservative Brethren in the 1920s, who organized the Dunkard Brethren Church, which continues to uphold the Brethren practices of plain dress and headcovering.

During the 1940s and 1950s, acts of global Christian service flourished and energized the denomination. Service work was centered at the Brethren Service Center in New Windsor, Md., after Brethren purchased a former college campus there for that purpose. Many Brethren joined Brethren Volunteer Service and Heifers for Relief, which incorporated independently in 1953 and eventually became Heifer International. The Brethren helped establish the Christian Rural Overseas Program (CROP), which was originally housed at Bethany Biblical Seminary, the Brethren seminary in Oak Brook, Illinois. Well-known leaders of the Brethren Service initiatives included Dan West and M.R. (Michael Robert) Zigler.

From the end of the Second World War to the present, Brethren have continued to be active in service and missions around the world. Differences have also remained, with Brethren individuals, churches, and districts disagreeing about issues including Biblical authority, ordination of women, homosexuality, climate change, and ecumenism.

The 1958 Annual Conference in Des Moines, Iowa, decided that trine immersion would not be required of all members, allowed ordination of women, opened love feast to members of any church, and permitted bread and cup communion outside of love feast.

At the Annual Conference in Ocean Grove, New Jersey, the next year, a group of conservative Brethren responded by forming the Brethren Revival Fellowship (BRF). The BRF describes itself as &quot;a loyal concern movement within the Church of the Brethren.&quot; The BRF advocates simple dress, Biblical inerrancy, church discipline, and an evangelical understanding of faith. It has been critical of the denomination&#x27;s involvement in political and social causes, as well as its association with the World Council of Churches and the National Council of Churches.

Progressive-leaning groups have also grown. Groups including the Womaen&#x27;s Caucus, Voices for an Open Spirit, Open Table Cooperative, and Brethren-Mennonite Council on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Interests advocate changes to church doctrine and practice. Proposed changes have include giving the denomination a gender-neutral name, allowing LGBT Brethren to be ordained as ministers and get married, and increasing the political and social mission of the church.

Although a divide exists within the church on these issues, the official position of the church is that the Bible is the Word of God, and that covenant relationships between homosexuals are unacceptable. However, the church also affirms &quot;unity in diversity&quot;, which generally allows for church districts and congregations to set doctrine.

=== 21st century ===
In July 2019, the Association of Brethren Churches, since renamed the Covenant Brethren Church (CBC), organized as a movement to explore separation from the Church of the Brethren. The CBC began with a vision cast in July 2019, as Church of the Brethren leaders from thirteen districts gathered in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, to pray, discern, and discuss a new vision for Brethren in the 21st Century. A temporary executive board was called, and sub-teams were tasked with working at various aspects of the vision. Subsequent, steadily growing gatherings of Brethren from across the United States met in Winchester and Woodstock, Virginia and widely affirmed these developments.

On November 16, 2019, at the Antioch Church in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, the assembled group was first called The Covenant Brethren Church, and moved toward establishing an office in north-central West Virginia. A Statement of Faith and by-laws are in development for this new movement. The CBC has stated that it fully affirms biblical authority, the sanctity of marriage as expressed in Genesis 2 and affirmed by Jesus Christ in Matthew 19, the sanctity of human life from conception, and the historical New Testament ideals and practices held by the Brethren since 1708.

The Church of the Brethren Leadership Team responded to these developments with a statement expressing concerns with the CBC&#x27;s direction and said division was &quot;not a path forward.&quot; The Church of the Brethren, meanwhile, has been moving forward with a &quot;Compelling Vision Statement&quot; process designed to create a direction for the denomination that will aid in unifying it and moving it forward. In 2024, the worldwide Church of the Brethren organized along national lines to form the Global Church of the Brethren Communion with founding members Brazil, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Honduras, India, Nigeria, Rwanda, Spain, Uganda, the United States, and Venezuela.

In 2023, all six Puerto Rican churches in the Church of the Brethren joined the Covenant Brethren Church. This was affirmed in 2024.

== Statistics ==
According to a denomination census released in 2020, it has 11 member denominations in 11 countries, approximately 2,600 churches and 600,000 baptized members.

The Church of the Brethren in the United Statesâlike many other mainline churchesâhas experienced a steady decline in membership since the middle of the 20thÂ century. Despite the overall decline, growth has occurred in some areas through church planting, evangelism, and outreach. It has also spread into other countries including the Dominican Republic (where it is called &quot;), Haiti (as &quot;), Brazil, and Spain.

In Nigeria, the Church of the Brethren is literally known as &quot;Church of the Children of the Same Mother&quot; (, or EYN). Mission work began in Nigeria in 1923. The membership of EYN, which must be renewed annually, reached 148,000 members in 2002, surpassing the membership of the US-based church. In 1965, the Brethren missionaries working in Ecuador since 1945, merged the churches they planted with those of the United Andean Indian Mission, to form the United Evangelical Church, now United Evangelical Methodist Church of Ecuador. In a similar way, in 1970, the mission in India merged with the Anglicans, Baptists, Disciples of Christ and Presbyterians to form the Church of North India, though some congregations have seceded since the merger.

As of 2019 it was reported on the church&#x27;s yearbook that US membership had dropped below 100,000 and as of 2020 membership dropped around 91,000. As of year 2021 down trend continued to around 87,000 members.

== Beliefs ==

=== Noncreedalism ===

The Brethren have &quot;no creed&quot;, but embrace the entire New Testament as their &quot;rule of faith and practice&quot;. If a single part of the New Testament is most pointed to as a guide for members&#x27; lives, it is the Sermon on the Mount. The early Brethren were very meticulous in applying the New Testament to every situation. For example, they baptize in a forward direction because &quot;we are baptized into his death&quot;, and at the moment of his death, Jesus&#x27; head fell forward.

When disagreements arise regarding the correct interpretation of New Testament passages or general congregation issues, local congregations go to their regional district conference for resolution. If necessary, the final authority for settling such disputes is the Annual Conference. The minutes of Annual Conference give a clear picture of what matters have been in dispute and how Brethren interpret the New Testament. However, some congregations accept or even encourage individual interpretation of the Bible and their faith.

In keeping with egalitarianism and respect for the individual, evangelism in the Church of the Brethren is practiced by personal demonstration of faith via good works in the world community, and by nonconfrontational witnessing.

Brethren espouse the basic beliefs of Christianity, such as the divinity of Christ. They emphasize peace, simplicity, the equality of believers, and consistent obedience to Christ, and community discernment of scripture. Community, both within and without the church, is promoted, and Brethren often describe themselves in terms of what they do, rather than what they believe, which is consistent with their notion of a lived faith. Brethren also affirm that &quot;faith without works is dead&quot;, and are heavily involved in disaster relief and other charitable works.

=== Peace ===
The Church of the Brethren is one of the historic peace churches, which includes Quakers, Amish, Apostolic and Mennonite churches. This is because two of the Brethren&#x27;s fundamental beliefs are nonviolent resolution of conflict and nonresistance to evil, which they combine with antiwar and peace efforts around the world. The church&#x27;s commitment to love the enemy and use nonviolence is summarized in its phrase, &quot;all war is sin&quot; (Annual Conference, 1935), and the fact that many Brethren have refused to engage in military service.

During the American Revolution and the American Civil War, Brethren required their members to abstain from military service, believing that obedience to Christ precluded such involvements. Until the early 20th century, Brethren baptismal applicants were required to promise that they would uphold the church&#x27;s teaching about &quot;being defenseless&quot;. During the Second World War, Brethren worked with the government to create a system of alternative service, which would allow conscientious objectors to serve their nation and humanity through nonviolent service. Civilian Public Service was a result of the three historic peace churches collaborating with the U.S. government. While the government provided tools and materials and their work was managed by agencies such as the Soil Conservation or Forest Service, &quot;the historic peace churches funded all the expenses for the men, including food, administrative costs, and a tiny monthly stipend of $2.50&quot; (). Alternative service has evolved into Brethren Volunteer Service, a church agency that places many young people and some older persons in volunteer human-service jobs, usually for a one-year term.

Despite the church&#x27;s official stance, there are many members of the Church of the Brethren that do not agree with pacifism. This was made particularly evident when, during the Second World War 80% of young Brethren draftees entered active duty in the military. Recent national surveys of the Brethren suggest that only a minority of the current membership views military service as wrong.

=== Priesthood of all believers ===
Brethren follow a nonhierarchical pattern of church life. In the past, most congregations were served by multiple &quot;free&quot; ministers, elected by their own congregations, who supported themselves through other occupations. Today, most congregations have paid pastors, but their function is still somewhat limited, with the laity still taking a very active role in ministerial work.

=== Simplicity ===
Brethren have been urged (and in earlier times compelled) to live a relatively simple lifestyle. At various points in their history, Brethren have been prohibited or discouraged from attending fairs and carnivals, swearing oaths, driving motorized vehicles, attending secular colleges, joining secret societies, filing lawsuits, gambling, and using tobacco or alcoholic beverages.

Simplicity, or nonconformity as it was called until the early 20th century, was once very noticeable in Brethren dress and grooming. Men wore black coats with no collar, and hooks instead of buttons (often referred to as Brethren garb or dressing &quot;in the order&quot;). They would wear beards, but no mustaches. The mustache was seen as a sign of the saloon or the military. Also, the beards were cut in a manner to avoid interference with the kiss of peace. In addition, they wore broad-brimmed black hats.

Women wore long dresses in dark colors, and a white kappâa prayer covering. Today, Brethren garb is still worn in the most conservative congregations, although some men dress in a simple style by wearing a collared shirt in a single color without a tie, while women in these congregations may continue to practice the use of a prayer covering. The traditional Brethren plain dress is very similar to the clothing of the present-day Amish. The Dunkard Brethren Church, formed in 1926 by conservative members of Church of the Brethren, continues to preserve the traditional Brethren practice of plain dress as do the Old German Baptist Brethren who withdrew during the 1880s.

Most Brethren were well-acculturated by the second half of the 20th century. Today, many members of the church take simplicity to mean living a more ecologically friendly lifestyle by consuming less and being aware of the effect of their choices on the earth and other people (see simple living). In many respects, twenty-first century Brethren lifestyles mirror the lifestyles of their non-Brethren neighbors.

=== Social issues ===
Like many mainline denominations, the Church of the Brethren has been debating issues related to human sexuality. In 2002, the Michigan District licensed and ordained an openly gay pastor, making it the first district to do so in the denomination. However, in 2003, the Annual Conference voted to reject the ordination of openly gay and lesbian pastors.

Since then, however, several congregations within the denomination have publicly announced their support for same-sex marriage and openly LGBT clergy. In 2012, the Church of the Brethren adopted a resolution opposing same-sex marriage, but some congregations protested the resolution and some voted to begin performing same-gender marriages. Some congregations also publicly welcome transgender members. In 2018, the Atlantic Northeast District rejected a proposal to terminate the credentials of clergy who perform a same-sex marriage because the vote did not receive the necessary two-thirds majority. The Northern Ohio District did approve a policy to terminate the clergy credentials of those pastors who perform same-sex marriage. Virginia&#x27;s Shenandoah District has similarly withdrawn ordination from ministers who would perform same-sex marriages.

Official church statements oppose abortion while committing to &quot;develop constructive, creative alternatives&quot;.

The Brethren avoid the use of the term &quot;sacraments&quot;, preferring the term &quot;ordinances&quot;. This refers to the symbolic actions ordered by Jesus Christ and practiced by the early church. The Brethren ordinances are:

=== Anointing for healing ===

The person seeking anointing is administered a small amount of oil on his or her forehead. This is followed by the laying on of hands and a prayer for wholeness. This is not to be confused with extreme unction (last rites), since healing is prayed for and expected. Healing is explicitly stated to include emotional and spiritual healing, as well as physical healing.

Anointing and laying on of hands have also been used for other purposes, such as consecrating someone for missions or other special service.

=== Believer&#x27;s baptism ===
The Brethren believe that believer&#x27;s baptism is an outward sign of an inward experience of salvation. Hence, baptism is not performed until one is able to understand and accept the message of the gospel, typically at about age 13. In the early years of the denomination, the age at baptism was generally older. The mode of baptism is trine (three times) immersion in a forward direction in the Name of the Father, and in the name of the Son, and in the name of the Holy Spirit. This is followed by laying on of hands for the impartation of the Holy Spirit.

In the early years of the church, people coming into the Church of the Brethren from other denominations were expected to be rebaptized. Today, most congregations will receive members by reaffirmation of faith or by letter of transfer from another congregation or denomination.

=== Love feast ===

The Brethren love feast is a conscious imitation of Jesus&#x27; Last Supper with his disciples. It begins with foot washing symbolizing cleansing, humility, and service. They then share a meal, which has symbolized the eschatalogical gathering of the faithful when Christ returns, but currently emphasizes fellowship within the faith community. Finally, they share the bread and cup communion (using unfermented red grape juice), symbolizing participation in Christ&#x27;s suffering and death. There may also be hymns and a sermon, as well as a preliminary time of self-examination. Usually women and men sit at different tables, but in most congregations, no onus exists on sitting togetherâby family, child with parent, to avoid crowding a table, so forth. Even though the Love Feast has changed over the yearsâbecoming shorter, more interactive and less somber, and providing alternatives such as hand-washingâit retains the same three components that it has included from the founding of the Brethren.

Congregations typically hold love feast on Maundy Thursday and again on World Communion Sunday in October. Some congregations also have bread-and-cup communion periodically during regular worship services.

== Structure ==
The Brethren practice the &quot;priesthood of all believers&quot;, and their structure is egalitarian. Some members still address each other as &quot;Brother Sam&quot; or &quot;Sister Sarah&quot;, for example. The practice is more common in the Eastern United States. Even the moderator of Annual Conference, the highest elected office in the church, is addressed as &quot;Brother (or Sister) Moderator&quot;.

=== Ministry ===
The term &quot;minister&quot; is understood as both a spiritual and a functional role rather than a hierarchical position of authority. In the early days, most congregations had several ministers chosen (&quot;called&quot; or &quot;elected&quot;) by the members of the congregation. The concept of a professional pastor (first explicitly permitted in 1911) slowly became the predominant model, although some congregations still have &quot;free&quot; (nonsalaried) ministers and plural ministry.

Historically, there have been three degrees of ministry in the Church of the Brethren:
*The first degree (now known as a licensed minister) is bestowed on those who are considering serving as ministers. The period of licensure is a time for education and self-examination, after which the individual either advances to ordination or returns to lay status.
*The second degree minister, or ordained minister, is one who intends to continue serving in a ministerial role, usually as a professional pastor, teacher, counselor, or administrator.
*The third degree of minister, also known as an elder, served as a head minister and supervised other ministers in a congregation. By the 1960s, many roles previously reserved for non-salaried elders had been assigned to salaried pastors, leaving elders with little unique ministerial function. So the Annual Conference of 1967 decided that no elders would be elected after that time. Some congregations in the Southern Pennsylvania and Atlantic Northeast Districts still elect elders.

The denomination ordains women as pastors and affirms them for all levels of leadership in the church.

The Brethren also select lay leaders as deacons as in most congregations. They assist in ministerial functions, particularly by tending to the physical and spiritual needs of individual members. Often, a husband and wife serve together as deacons.

=== Officers ===
The leading officers in the Church of the Brethren for business purposes are called moderators. Their principal function is to chair business meetings. There are congregational moderators, district moderators, and an Annual Conference (denominational) moderator.

In current practice, the Annual Conference moderator is elected to a two-year term, serving for the first year as &quot;moderator-elect.&quot; An Annual Conference secretary, elected to a five-year term, keeps track of the flow of business. Together, the officers &quot;receive and process the business of Annual Conference, establish and manage agendas ... represent the Conference at district meetings and other appropriate settings, and respond to concerns of denominational members regarding actions and activities of Conference.&quot;

=== Boards, committees, and agencies ===
Each congregation selects delegates to serve at an Annual Conference (traditionally called Annual Meeting), which is the final human authority in questions of faith and practice. Issues that cannot be resolved on a local level, or which have implications for the church as a whole are framed as &quot;queries&quot;, which are submitted by a congregation to the district (since 1866), and then, if necessary, are passed on to Annual Conference. Standing Committee, a body composed of representatives from each district, processes the business that comes to Annual Conference and makes recommendations. Often a committee is formed to study the matter, and an answer is reported and adopted by a vote of the delegates at a subsequent Annual Conference, although sometimes a query is returned.

The Brethren have numerous boards and committees (sometimes called &quot;teams&quot;) that can be either temporary or permanent and either highly focused on one issue (e.g. evangelism) or general in scope. Several agencies are given charge of carrying out the ministries of the church under the auspices of Annual Conference.

At the 2008 Annual Conference of the Church of the Brethren, two of these agenciesâthe Church of the Brethren General Board and the Association of Brethren Caregiversâwere combined into a single entity, the Church of the Brethren, Inc., the ministry arm of which is now known as the Mission and Ministry Board. Headquartered in Elgin, Illinois, its programs include, Global Mission and Service, Brethren Volunteer Service, Youth/Young Adult Ministries, Intercultural Ministries, and Discipleship Ministries. The &quot;Messenger&quot; periodical, whose roots go back to 1851âmaking it one of the oldest continually operating church periodicals in the countryâis the official magazine of the church.

The general secretary, typically hired for renewable five-year terms, oversees the work of the Church of the Brethren, Inc., and is the chief ecumenical officer of the denomination. Other Annual Conference agencies include Bethany Theological Seminary, Brethren Benefit Trust, and On Earth Peace.

<text>Avianca [[List of legal entity types by country#Colombia|S.A.]] (acronym in Spanish for &quot;Aerovias del Continente Americano S.A.&quot;, &quot;Airways of the American Continent&quot;, and stylized as avianca since October 2023) is the largest airline in Colombia. It has been the flag carrier of Colombia since December 5, 1919, when it was initially registered under the name SCADTA. It is headquartered in Colombia, with its registered office in Barranquilla and its global headquarters in BogotÃ¡ and main hub at El Dorado International Airport. Avianca is the flagship of a group of airlines of the Americas, which operates as one airline using a codesharing system. Avianca is the largest airline in Colombia and second largest in South America, after LATAM of Chile. Avianca and its subsidiaries have the most extensive network of destinations in the Americas. Before the merger with TACA in 2010, it was wholly owned by Synergy Group, a South American holding company established by GermÃ¡n Efromovich and specializing in air transport. It is listed on the Colombia Stock Exchange.

Through SCADTA, Avianca is the world&#x27;s second oldest extant airline after KLM and celebrated its 100th anniversary in December 2019. It is the oldest airline in the Western Hemisphere. It became an official member of Star Alliance on June 21, 2012, after a process that lasted approximately 18 months from the initial announcement of its invitation to join the alliance. On May 10, 2020, Avianca filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in a court in New York City, and liquidated its subsidiary Avianca PerÃº, due to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.

==History==
===SCADTA (1919â1940)===

The airline traces its history back to December 5, 1919, in the city of Barranquilla, Colombia. Colombians Ernesto Cortissoz Alvarez-Correa (the first President of the airline), Rafael MarÃ­a Palacio, CristÃ³bal Restrepo, Jacobo Correa and Aristides Noguera and Germans Werner KÃ¤mmerer, Stuart Hosie and Albert Tietjen founded the Colombo-German Company, called &quot;Sociedad Colombo-Alemana de Transportes AÃ©reos&quot; or SCADTA. The company accomplished its first flight on September 5, 1920, between Barranquilla and the nearby town of Puerto Colombia using a Junkers F.13, transporting 57 pieces of mail. The flight was piloted by German Helmuth von Krohn. This and another aircraft of the same type were completely mechanically constructed monoplanes, the engines of which had to be modified to efficiently operate in the climate of the country. There were nine aircraft in the fleet with a total range of which could carry up to four passengers and two crewmen. Due to the topographic characteristics of the country and the lack of airports at the time, floats were adapted for two of the Junkers aircraft to make water landings in the rivers near different towns. Using these floats, Helmuth von Krohn was able to perform the first inland flight over Colombia on October 20, 1920, following the course of the Magdalena River; the flight took eight hours and required four emergency landings in the water.

Soon after the airline was founded, German scientist and philanthropist Peter von Bauer became interested in the airline and contributed general knowledge, capital and a tenth aircraft for the company, as well as obtaining concessions from the Colombian government to operate the country&#x27;s airmail transportation division using the airline, which began in 1922. This new contract allowed SCADTA to thrive in a new frontier of aviation. By the mid-1920s, SCADTA started its first international routes covering destinations in Venezuela and the United States. In 1924, the aircraft that both Ernesto Cortissoz and Helmuth von Krohn were flying crashed into an area currently known as Bocas de Ceniza in Barranquilla, killing them. In the early 1940s, Peter von Bauer sold his shares in the airline to the US-owned Pan Am.

===National Airways of Colombia (1940â1994)===

On June 14, 1940, in the city of Barranquilla, SCADTA, under ownership by United States businessmen, merged with regional Colombian airline SACO, forming the new &quot;AerovÃ­as Nacionales de Colombia S.A.&quot; or Avianca. Five Colombians participated in this: Rafael MarÃ­a Palacio, Jacobo A. Correa, Cristobal Restrepo, and Aristides Noguera, as well as German citizens Albert Teitjen, Werner KÃ¤merer, and Stuart Hosie, while the post of first President of Avianca was filled by MartÃ­n del Corral. Avianca claims SCADTA&#x27;s history as its own.

In 1946, Avianca began flights to Quito, Lima, Panama City, Miami, New York City and Europe, using Douglas DC-4s and C-54 Skymasters. In 1951, Avianca acquired Lockheed Constellations and Super Constellations. In 1956, the company transported the Colombian delegation to the Melbourne Olympics on a 61-hour trip, stopping only to refuel.

During the 1960s, the company built the Avianca Building in BogotÃ¡, designed by the architect GermÃ¡n Samper, which was inaugurated in 1969 on the south side of Santander Park. In 1961, Avianca leased two Boeing 707s to operate its international routes, and on November 2, 1961, it acquired its own Boeing 720s. In 1976, Avianca became the first Latin American airline to continuously operate the Boeing 747-100. Three years later, it started operations with more 747s, including two Combi aircraft, mixing cargo and passenger operations.

In 1981, Avianca undertook the construction of a new exclusive terminal called the Terminal Puente AÃ©reo, which was eventually inaugurated by President Julio CÃ©sar Turbay Ayala. Avianca&#x27;s original purpose for the terminal was for flights serving Cali, MedellÃ­n, Miami, and New York.

===Merger system (1994â2002)===

In 1994, Avianca, the regional carrier SAM and the helicopter operator Helicol merged, beginning Avianca&#x27;s new system of operations. This arrangement allowed for specialized services in cargo (Avianca Cargo) and postal services, as well as a more modern fleet, made up of Boeing 767s, Boeing 757s, MD-83s, Fokker 50s, and Bell helicopters. In 1996, Avianca Postal Services became &quot;Deprisa&quot;, which provided various mail services.

On December 10, 1998, Avianca officially opened its new hub in BogotÃ¡, offering around 6,000 possible connections per week, and an increased number of frequencies, schedules, and destinations, taking advantage of the privileged geographical location of the country&#x27;s capital, for the benefit of Colombian and international travelers between South America, Europe, and North America.

===Summa Alliance (2002â2004)===
After the September 11 attacks, Avianca, SAM, and their major rival ACES joined efforts to create the &quot;Alianza Summa&quot;, which began merged operations on May 20, 2002, to offer a more efficient service with concerns to quality, quantity, security and competition in a new struggling marketplace. However, adverse circumstances within the industry and markets forced the alliance to disband. In November 2003, the Alianza Summa was disbanded, ACES was liquidated altogether and SAM was acquired to be a regional carrier under Avianca&#x27;s brand.

===American Continent Airways (2004â2009)===
On December 10, 2004, Avianca concluded a major reorganization process, undertaken after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, by obtaining confirmation of its reorganization plan, which was financially backed by the Brazilian consortium, Synergy Group and the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia, allowing the airline to obtain funds for US$63 million, in the 13 months following withdrawal from bankruptcy.

Under this plan, Avianca was bought by Synergy Group and was consolidated with its subsidiaries OceanAir and VIP. The company&#x27;s full legal name was changed from &quot;AerovÃ­as Nacionales de Colombia&quot; (National Airways of Colombia) to &quot;AerovÃ­as del Continente Americano&quot; (Airways of the American Continent), retaining the acronym Avianca. On February 28, 2005, Avianca presented its new logo and livery.

===Avianca-TACA merger (2009â2013)===

In October 2009, it was announced that Avianca would merge with TACA Airlines. This created AviancaTaca Holding, which instantly became one of the region&#x27;s largest airlines, with 129 aircraft and flights to more than 100 destinations.

In November 2009, the airline&#x27;s Chief Executive Fabio Villegas announced that the airline was looking to replace its Fokker 50 and Fokker 100 with newer aircraft of 100 seats or less. On January 1, 2011, the airline decided to retire the Fokker 100 in 2011 and replace them with 10 Airbus A318s leased from GECAS. The aircraft were delivered from February to April 2011.

====Star Alliance====
On November 10, 2010, Star Alliance announced that Avianca (and its merger counterpart, TACA) were full members in 2012. Due to Avianca&#x27;s entry into Star Alliance, it ended its codeshare agreement with Delta Air Lines and began a new codeshare agreement with United Airlines. TACA has been codesharing with United Airlines since 2006. On June 21, 2012, Avianca and TACA were both officially admitted into Star Alliance.

===Avianca Holdings (2013â2019)===
On March 21, 2013, at the annual general meeting, the shareholders approved the change of corporate name from &quot;AviancaTaca Holding&quot; to Avianca Holdings. TACA and all other AviancaTaca airlines changed their brand to Avianca on May 28, 2013.

As of 2017, Avianca operates the second-most daily international flights from Miami with 16, second only to American Airlines.

In August 2018, Avianca had some operational difficulties due to problems with the platform it used to assign crew schedules. This resulted in the cancellation of several flights within Colombia. Likewise, due to the stoppage of ACDAC pilots in 2017, only in October 2018 were all flight itineraries managed by the airline restored.

On March 1, 2019, Avianca launched a subsidiary named Avianca Express, which operated ATR-72s on short regional flights within Colombia.

===2020 bankruptcy (2020-2021)===
Avianca had significant financial liabilities in 2019. Because of this, they issued more debt to cover short-term liabilities and concluded a debt exchange on December 31, 2019. In response to the global outbreak of COVID-19, the Colombian government&#x27;s lockdown suspended Avianca&#x27;s domestic and international operations; most of the companyâs 20,000 employees went without pay throughout this period, and the airline operated no scheduled passenger flights between late March and May outside of repatriation missions. As a result of this temporary cessation of business, the company had seen 80% of its revenue stopped.

Avianca Holdings and 23 affiliated debtors filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on May 10, 2020, as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent global shutdown, and their financial situation before and during the crisis. The airline holding liquidated their subsidiary Avianca PerÃº the same day. The debtors were granted joint administration of the cases under Case No. 20-11133. The airline had accumulated a total debt of USD 7.3 billion at the end of 2019.

Avianca implemented numerous cost-reduction plans during and following their bankruptcy including increasing the passenger capacity and redesigning the cabin of their Airbus A320s, simplifying their fleet to only the A320 family and Boeing 787, the latter of which will also feature an economy class cabin redesign, and introducing new, cheaper, and more competitive fares with increased options for flexibility including checked and carry-on bags, seat selection, and priority boarding.

In November 2021, Avianca Holdings announced they would move their legal address from Panama to the United Kingdom, and that they would change their name to Avianca Group. Their global headquarters remains in BogotÃ¡. On November 2, 2021, Avianca&#x27;s reorganization plan was approved by the court, and on December 1, 2021, more than a year and a half after filing, Avianca emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time in its history.

===Abra Group and Viva Air merger (2022-present)===
On April 29, 2022, Avianca announced plans to acquire low-cost competitor Viva Air Colombia and its subsidiary Viva Air PerÃº. On May 11, 2022, it was announced that Avianca planned to merge with Viva Air, and Gol Linhas AÃ©reas Inteligentes to form the Abra Group, and that Avianca would be the acquiring company. The merger was rejected by the Colombian Civil Aviation Authority in November 2022. Avianca stated that the rejection of the merger would not affect the plans for the Abra Group.

In September 2022, Ecuador&#x27;s Superintendency for the Control of Market Power became the first government body to approve the merger. In December 2022, Avianca stated that they had reached all necessary agreements for the group bar &quot;certain financing&quot;, and that they had obtained approval from regulatory bodies in Brazil and the United States. Avianca also stated that they do not need regulatory approval in Colombia because GOL has no presence in the country, and hence there would be no overlap in Colombia.

On January 19, 2023, the Ministry of Transport and Aerocivil formally annulled the November 2022 decision to reject the Avianca-Viva Air merger, citing &quot;procedural irregularities&quot; found within the first review process. A second review is due to take place in &quot;an urgent manner&quot;, because the merger proposal was filed under &quot;exception for a company in crisis&quot;, referencing Viva Air&#x27;s financial situation.

On March 21, 2023, Aerocivil announced that it would approve the Avianca-Viva merger conditionally if the new entity complied with the following: to either refund or honor passengers&#x27; cancelled bookings made before Viva Air suspended operations; to return some in-demand slots at BogotÃ¡&#x27;s El Dorado Airport previously held by Viva Air; to maintain Viva Air&#x27;s low-cost model for consumers within Colombia; to reinstate flights between BogotÃ¡ and Buenos Aires; to maintain a fare cap on routes where the entity is the only operator; and, as the new entity would hold a majority of the market share in Colombia, to ensure that the market remains dynamic.

On May 13, 2023, after analyzing the &quot;financial and technical implications&quot; of the merger under these conditions, Avianca withdrew its plans for the acquisition of Viva Air, given the strict requirements of Aerocivil and the damage that these would have on the airline&#x27;s economy.

In October 2023, the company announced a rebrand and changes to its business model. Avianca changed its name from Avianca to &quot;avianca&quot;, adjusting its operating model to a more low-cost-friendly one.

In March 2019 the delivery of 17 Airbus A320neo family aircraft was cancelled, and deliveries of another 35 jets were rescheduled to 2026 to 2028, instead of 2020 to 2022.

In March 2022 the airline confirmed an order for 88 new A320neo with deliveries between 2025 and 2031.

In February 2024, Avianca received one of the 3 Boeing 787-8s from Norwegian Air Shuttle. The airline said it wants to deviate from wet leases such as the one from Wamos Air and its A330, in addition, it wants to do it only with 787-8s owned by the company itself.

<text>Belo Horizonte is the sixth-largest city in Brazil, with a population of around 2.3Â million, and the third largest metropolitan area, containing a population of 6 million. It is the 13th-largest city in South America and the 18th-largest in the Americas. The metropolis is anchor to the Belo Horizonte metropolitan area, ranked as the third most populous metropolitan area in Brazil and the 17th most populous in the Americas. Belo Horizonte is the capital of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil&#x27;s second-most populous state. It is the first planned modern city in Brazil.

The region was first settled in the early 18th century, but the city as it is known today was planned and constructed in the 1890s to replace Ouro Preto as the capital of Minas Gerais. The city features a mixture of contemporary and classical buildings and is home to several modern Brazilian architectural icons, most notably the Pampulha Complex. In planning the city, AarÃ£o Reis and Francisco Bicalho sought inspiration in the urban planning of Washington, D.C. The city has employed notable programs in urban revitalization and food security, for which it has been awarded international accolades.

The city is built on several hills, and is completely surrounded by mountains. There are several large parks in the surroundings of Belo Horizonte. The Mangabeiras Park (Parque das Mangabeiras), southeast of the city centre in the hills of Curral Ridge (Serra do Curral), has a broad view of the city. It has an area of , of which is covered by the native forest. The Jambreiro Woods (Mata do Jambreiro) nature reserve extends over , with vegetation typical of the Atlantic Forest. More than 100 species of birds inhabit the reserve, as well as 10 species of mammals.

Belo Horizonte was one of the host cities of the 1950 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Additionally, the city shared as host of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup and the football tournament during the 2016 Summer Olympics.

==History==

=== Portuguese colonization ===
The metropolis was once a small village, founded by , a bandeirante explorer from SÃ£o Paulo. The explorer settled in the region in 1701, leading a gold rush expedition. He then established a farm called &quot;Curral d&#x27;el Rey,&quot; archaic Portuguese for the &quot;King&#x27;s Corral&quot;.

The farm&#x27;s wealth and success encouraged people from surrounding places to move into the region, and Curral del Rey became a village surrounded by farms.

Another important factor contributing to the growth of the village was people immigrating from the SÃ£o Francisco River region, who had to pass through Curral d&#x27;el Rey to reach southern parts of Brazil.

Travelers usually visited a small wooden chapel, where they prayed for a safe trip, so the chapel was named Capela da Nossa Senhora da Boa Viagem, which means &quot;Chapel of Our Lady of the Good Journey.&quot; After the construction of Belo Horizonte, the old baroque chapel was replaced by a neo-Gothic church that became the city&#x27;s cathedral.

=== Brazilian empire and republic ===

The previous capital of Minas Gerais, Ouro Preto (meaning &quot;black gold,&quot; due to dark rocks with gold inside found on the region), originally called &quot;Vila Rica&quot; (&quot;wealthy village&quot;), was a symbol of both the monarchic Brazilian Empire and the period when most of Brazilian income was from the mining industry. That never pleased the members of the InconfidÃªncia Mineira, republican intellectuals who conspired against the Portuguese dominion of Brazil.

In 1889 Brazil became a republic, and it was agreed that a new state capital, in tune with a modern and prosperous Minas Gerais, had to be established.

In 1893 due to the climatic and topographic conditions, Curral Del Rey was selected by Minas Gerais governor Afonso Pena among other cities as the location for the new economic and cultural center of the state, under the new name of &quot;Cidade de Minas&quot;, or City of Minas.

, an urbanist from ParÃ¡, was then chosen to design the second planned city of Brazil after Teresina. Cidade de Minas was inaugurated in 1897, with many unfinished buildings as the Brazilian government set a deadline for its completion. The local government encouraged growth through subsidies. It offered free lots and funding for building houses. An interesting feature of Reis&#x27; downtown street plan for Belo Horizonte was the inclusion of a symmetrical array of perpendicular and diagonal streets named after Brazilian states and indigenous Brazilian indigenous tribes.

In 1906 the name was changed to Belo Horizonte. At that time, the city was experiencing a considerable industrial expansion that increased its commercial and service sectors. From its very beginning, the city&#x27;s original plan prohibited workers from living inside the urban area, which was defined by Avenida do Contorno (a long avenue that goes around the city&#x27;s central areas).

Reserved for government workers (hence the name of the trendy neighbourhood &quot;FuncionÃ¡rios&quot;), and bringing about an accelerated occupation outside the city&#x27;s area well provided with infrastructure since its very beginning. Obviously, the city&#x27;s original planners did not count on its ongoing population growth, which proved especially intense in the last 20 years of the 20th century.

In the 1940s a young Oscar Niemeyer designed the Pampulha Neighbourhood to great acclaim, a commission he got thanks to then-mayor and soon-to-be-president Juscelino Kubitschek. These two men are largely responsible for the wide avenues, large lakes, parks, and jutting skylines that characterize the city today. A 1949 American government film favorably reviewed the planning and building of the city.

Belo Horizonte is fast becoming a regional center of commerce. The Latin American research and development center of Google, situated in Belo Horizonte, was responsible for the management and operation of the former social networking website Orkut. It continues to be a trendsetter in the arts, particularly where music, literature, architecture, and the &quot;avant garde&quot; are concerned.

==Geography==
===Surrounding cities and metropolitan area===
The term &quot;Grande BH&quot; (&quot;Greater Belo Horizonte&quot;) denotes any of various definitions for the metropolitan area of Belo Horizonte. The legally defined &quot;Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte&quot; consists of 34 municipalities in total, and a population of around six million inhabitants (, according to Brazil&#x27;s National Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE)).

The intense process of urbanization that is taking place in the metropolitan region has made some of the political boundaries between municipalities in the region obsolete.

The city is now composed of a relatively contiguous urban area, centred on Belo Horizonte, which extends out into municipalities such as Contagem, Betim, Nova Lima, Raposos, RibeirÃ£o das Neves, IbiritÃ©, Santa Luzia and SabarÃ¡, among others.

The municipality is bounded to the north by Vespasiano, to the north east by Santa Luzia, by SabarÃ¡ to the east, by Nova Lima to the southeast, Brumadinho to the south and RibeirÃ£o das Neves, Contagem and IbiritÃ© to the west.

According to the current geographic classification by IBGE, the municipality belongs to the Immediate Geographic Region of Belo Horizonte, in the Intermediate Geographic Region of Belo Horizonte.

===Geology and geomorphology===
Belo Horizonte lies on a region of contact between different geological series of the Proterozoic. The geology largely comprises crystalline rocks, which give rise to the varied morphology of the landscape. It is located in a large geological unit known as the craton of SÃ£o Francisco, referring to extensive crustal nucleus of central-eastern Brazil, tectonically stable at the end of the Paleoproterozoic and bordering areas that suffered the regeneration at the Neoproterozoic.

The archean rocks members of Belo Horizonte complex and supracrustal sequences of the Paleoproterozoic is predominant. The area of Belo Horizonte complex includes the geomorphological unit called &quot;Depression of Belo Horizonte&quot;, which represents about 70% of the municipality area and has its greatest expression in the northern RibeirÃ£o Arrudas pipeline. The metasedimentary rocks has its area of occurrence on the south of RibeirÃ£o Arrudas pipeline, constituting about 30% of the area of Belo Horizonte. The characteristics of this area are lithological diversities and rugged topography, which has its maximum expression in the &quot;Serra do Curral&quot; (Corral Ridge), the southern boundary of the municipality.

Its soil comprises a succession of layers of rocks of varied composition, represented by itabirite, dolomite, quartzite, phyllites and schists different from the general direction northwestâsoutheast and dip to the southeast. The hills of Belo Horizonte are part of the EspinhaÃ§o Mountains and belong to the larger Itacolomi mountain chain. The highest point in the municipality is in the &quot;Serra do Curral&quot;, reaching .

===Parks===

A centre for conservation and preservation of animals and plants it has also developed environmental education projects. The Zoo, which encompasses a total area of 1.4Â million square meters, is located at the Foundation&#x27;s headquarters and is regarded as one of the most complete in Latin America. It has a collection of close to 900 animals representing 200 species, from Brazil and other parts of the world, as well as the first public butterfly sanctuary in South America.

Pampulha Ecological Park is administered by the Zoo-Botanical Foundation of Belo Horizonte and was inaugurated on May 21, 2004. It is of green area that offers to the population and the tourists a permanent programming of environmental, cultural and patrimonial education.

The city contains the Baleia State Park, created in 1988 but still not implemented as of 2014.
It contains part of the Serra do Rola-MoÃ§a State Park, created in 1994.

===Climate===

Belo Horizonte&#x27;s has a latitude at 19&#x27;55&quot; in the South tropical zone. Yearly temperatures average between . The KÃ¶ppen climate classification of the region is tropical savanna climate (&quot;Aw&quot;), milder due to the elevation, with humid/warm summers and dry/mild winters. Belo Horizonte is located about from the sea.

Even though inter-seasonal differences are not as pronounced as they are in temperate places, there is a contrast between spring and summer, and between fall and winter. The coldest month is generally July, with a lowest recorded temperature of . The hottest month is usually January.

With an elevation of , Belo Horizonte is cooled considerably by the relatively high elevation, which suppresses high maximum air temperatures experienced in nearby cities at lower altitudes. Belo Horizonte&#x27;s climate is mild throughout the year. Temperatures vary between , the average being . Winter is dry and mostly sunny, and summer is rainy.

==Demographics==

===Ethnic groups===

According to the 2022 census, there were 2,315,560 people residing in the city of Belo Horizonte. The census revealed the following numbers: 1,008,878 White people (43.6%), 986,302 Pardo (Multiracial) people (42.6%), 312,920 Black people (13.5%), 4,881 Asian people (0.2%), 2,486 Amerindian people (0.1%).

In 2010, the city had 428,893 opposite-sex couples and 1,090 same-sex couples. The population of Belo Horizonte was 53.1% female and 46.9% male.

The Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte, called Greater Belo Horizonte, is the 3rd most populous of Brazil, after only Greater SÃ£o Paulo (with 19,672,582 people, first in Brazil and 5th in the world) and Greater Rio de Janeiro (with 14,387,000 people). The city is the 6th most populous of the country.

During the 18th century, Minas Gerais received many Portuguese immigrants, mainly from Northern Portugal as well as many enslaved Africans.

Belo Horizonte has a notable Italian influence; around 30% of the city&#x27;s population have some Italian origin. The Italian culture is present in the cuisine, dance, and language. People of German, Spanish, French, and Syrian-Lebanese ancestries also make up sizeable groups.

===Human development===
In 1993, under mayor Patrus Ananias de Souza, the city started a series of innovations based on its citizens having the &quot;right to food.&quot; These include, for example, creating farmers&#x27; markets in the town to enable direct sales and regularly surveying market prices and posting the results across the city. The city&#x27;s process of participatory budgeting was linked with these innovations, as a result of which the infant mortality rate was reduced by 50% in a decade.

There is some evidence that these programs have helped support a higher quality of life for the local farmers partnering with the city and that this may be having positive effects on biodiversity in the Atlantic rainforest around the city. The city&#x27;s development of these policies garnered the first &quot;Future Policy Award&quot; in 2009, awarded by the World Future Council, a group of 50 activists (including Frances Moore LappÃ©, Vandana Shiva, Wes Jackson, and Youssou N&#x27;Dour) concerned with the development and recognition of policies to promote a just and sustainable future.

The city has undertaken an internationally heralded project called Vila Viva (&quot;Living Village&quot; in Portuguese) that promises to &quot;urbanize&quot; the poorest areas (&quot;favelas&quot;), relocating families from areas with high risk of floods and landslides but keeping them in the same neighborhood, paving main avenues to allow public transportation, police and postal service to have access. All the work is done with 80% of locals, reducing unemployment and increasing family income. Former mayor Fernando da Mata Pimentel was nominated for World Mayor in 2005 on the strength of these and other programs.

==Economy==

Belo Horizonte receives large numbers of visitors, as it is in the Brazilian main economic axis, exerting influence even on other states. Multinational and Brazilian companies, such as Google, Deloitte, Thoughtworks, Localiza and Oi, maintain offices in the city. The service sector plays a very important role in the economy of Belo Horizonte, being responsible for 85% of the city&#x27;s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), with other industry making up most of the remaining 15%. Belo Horizonte has a developed industrial sector, being traditionally a hub of the Brazilian siderurgical and metallurgical industries, as the state of Minas Gerais has always been very rich in minerals, specifically iron ore.

Belo Horizonte is the distribution and processing centre of a rich agricultural and mining region and the nucleus of a burgeoning industrial complex. Production is centred on steel, steel products, automobiles, and textiles. Gold, manganese, and gemstones mined in the surrounding region are processed in the city.
The main industrial district of the city was set during the 1940s in Contagem, a part of greater Belo Horizonte. Multinational companies like FIAT (which opened its plant in Betim in 1974), Arcelor, and Toshiba have subsidiaries in the region, along with textiles like Group Rachelle Textil, Ematex and Cedro Textil, cosmetic, food, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, furnishing and refractory companies. Among the companies headquartered in the city are steel producer AÃ§ominas (held by Gerdau, one of the largest multinationals originated in Brazil); Usiminas; Belgo-Mineira (held by Arcelor); Acesita (partially held by Arcelor); mobile communication Vivo; and Telecom Italia Mobile, Dasein Executive Search, executive coaching company, as well as the NYSE-listed electrical company CEMIG. Leading steel product makers Sumitomo Metals of Japan and Vallourec of France also have plans to construct an integrated steel works on the outskirts of the city.

There are also a large number of small enterprises in the technology sector with regional to nationwide success, particularly in the fields of computing and biotechnology. Because of both governmental and private funding in the diversification of its economy, the city has become an international reference in Information Technology and Biotechnology, and is also cited because of the advanced corporate and university research in Biodiesel fuel. The number of jobs in the Information sector has been growing at annual rates above 50%. The Belo Horizonte Metropolitan Area, composed of 33 cities under the capital&#x27;s direct influence, is home to 16% of the country&#x27;s biotechnology companies, with annual sales of over R$550Â million.

Projects in these fields are likely to expand because of integration between universities, the oil company Petrobras and the Brazilian Government. One of the largest events that ever took place in the city, the Inter-American Development Bank meeting, occurred in 2005 and attracted people from all over the world.

For a long time it was marked by the predominance of its industrial sector, but from the 1990s there has been a constant expansion of the service sector economy, particularly in computer science, biotechnology, business tourism, fashion and the jewelry-making. The city is considered to be a strategic leader in the Brazilian economy. The move towards business tourism transformed the capital into a national hub for this segment of the tourist industry.

==Transport==

===Airports===
Belo Horizonte is served by two airports:
*Tancredo Neves/Confins International Airport, dedicated to domestic and international traffic. It is located in the municipalities of Lagoa Santa and Confins, from Belo Horizonte, and was opened in January 1984. Plans for gradual expansion to meet growing demand had been already drawn up from the airport&#x27;s inception. The airport has one of the lowest rates of shutdown for bad weather in the country. It ran at limited capacity until 2005, when a large proportion of Pampulha Airport air traffic was transferred to Confins. There are direct international flights to/from Buenos Aires, Fort Lauderdale, Lisbon, Orlando, Panama City, and Santiago;
*Pampulha â Carlos Drummond de Andrade Airport, dedicated to general aviation.

===Highways===

The city is connected to the rest of Minas Gerais state and the country by a number of roadways. Minas Gerais has the country&#x27;s largest federal highway network.
* BR-040 connects Belo Horizonte to Rio de Janeiro (going south) and BrasÃ­lia (going northwest). It also links other cities in the state, such as Juiz de Fora, Conselheiro Lafaiete, Barbacena, Sete Lagoas, and Paracatu.
* BR-262 begins in Mato Grosso do Sul and ends in EspÃ­rito Santo, crossing Minas Gerais from west to east. It links Belo Horizonte to ParÃ¡ de Minas, AraxÃ¡, ManhuaÃ§u, Uberaba, Governador Valadares, and VitÃ³ria, the capital of EspÃ­rito Santo state.
* BR-381 is an important federal highway. It connects Belo Horizonte to SÃ£o Paulo.
* MG-010 is a state highway that connects the capital to the Tancredo Neves International Airport, itself located in the municipalities of Confins and Lagoa Santa, which are part of the metropolitan area of Belo Horizonte. Starting in 2005, several flights were transferred from the Pampulha Regional Airport to the international airport. To improve access to the international airport, MG-010 is being expanded (effectively duplicating its lanes).

The city is also served by other minor roads such as state highways MG-020, MG-050, MG-030, and MG-433. There is also an East-West Express Way, which goes from the city to the nearby industrial centres of Contagem and Betim (together having a population of ca. 900,000), and Anel RodoviÃ¡rio, a kind of &quot;beltway&quot; â indeed it is not circumferential, but connects many highways, such as the federal (BR-ones) so it is not necessary for a large number of cars and trucks to pass through the city centre. Many of these roads are in poor condition, but in the last years many revitalization and rebuilding projects have been started.

===Bus system===
The bus system has a large number of bus lines going through all parts in the city, and is administered by &quot;BHTRANS&quot;. Among the upcoming projects are the expansion of the integration between bus lines and the metro, with integrated stations, many already in use. And the construction of bus corridors, with lanes and bus stops exclusively for the bus lines. Keeping buses from traffic congestions, making the trips more viable for commuters.

===Railways===
Belo Horizonte Metro or MetroBH started operating at the end of the 1970s. There is one line, with 19 stations, from Vilarinho to Eldorado Station, in Contagem, transporting over 160,000 people daily. The current projects of expansion include Line 2, linking the existing Calafate Station to the region of Barreiro. And Line 3, from the city&#x27;s main bus terminal to SÃ£o InÃ¡cio de Loyola, Savassi economical district. Line 2 is planned to be overground (similar to the current line) and Line 3 is planned to be underground, passing through the city&#x27;s financial centre, PraÃ§a Sete and Afonso Pena Avenue. Also, Line 1 is planned to be extended to Novo Eldorado Station.

For long distance, Belo Horizonte is served by the VitÃ³ria-Minas Railway. There are daily passenger trips connecting Belo Horizonte to Cariacica, in the metropolitan region of VitÃ³ria, EspÃ­rito Santo. On its route, the railway also connects Belo Horizonte to several locations on Eastern Minas Gerais, such as Governador Valadares, JoÃ£o Monlevade and the cities of the Vale do AÃ§o Metropolitan Region.

===Belo Horizonte Public Transportation statistics===
The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Belo Horizonte, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 85 min. 26% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 23 min, while 50% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 8.7Â km, while 19% travel for over 12Â km in a single direction.

==Culture==
===Music===
Clube da Esquina is one of the most important musical movements in the musical history of Brazil. It originated in the mid-1960s, and since then its members have been hugely influential in Brazilian and even international music, some like Milton Nascimento and Toninho Horta achieving worldwide acclaim. Other people involved in the movement include musicians, songwriters, composers, conductors and lyricists, such as Tavinho Moura, Wagner Tiso, Andersen Viana, Milton Nascimento, LÃ´ Borges, Beto Guedes, FlÃ¡vio Venturini, Toninho Horta, MÃ¡rcio Borges and Fernando Brant, among others.

The band Uakti, known for performing with self-built musical instruments, originated in Belo Horizonte under the influence of Walter Smetak and the Composition School from Bahia. Also, several nationally famous rock groups have been founded in Belo Horizonte, including Jota Quest, Pato Fu, Skank, 14 Bis and TianastÃ¡cia. In later years, Belo Horizonte has been more frequently included in Brazilian tours of foreign mainstream and independent acts.

Belo Horizonte is also known as the Brazilian Capital of Metal music, hence the huge number of heavy metal bands (and the likes) founded there, especially in the 1980s. Most importantly, Overdose, the first metal band from BH and one of the first to gain prominence in Brazil; Sepultura, the world&#x27;s best known Brazilian metal band; and SarcÃ³fago, one of the founders of modern black metal. The contemporary Christian music band Diante do Trono, is also of Belo Horizonte. A short instrumental song by American band Earth, Wind &amp; Fire is named after the city on their album Now, Then &amp; Forever.

===Museums===
Belo Horizonte features a number of museums including the Mineiro Museum, the AbÃ­lio Barreto Historic Museum, Arts and Workmanship Museum, a Natural History Museum and the UFMG Botanic Gardens, a telephone museum, the Pampulha Art Museum, the Professor Taylor Gramke Mineralogy Museum, and the UFMG Conservatory. The puppet theatre group Giramundo was established here in 1970, and continues to maintain a puppetry museum hosting a collection of their creations.


The Circuito Cultural PraÃ§a da Liberdade, located in the central region of Belo Horizonte, is the largest cultural circuit in Brazil. In all, there are eleven functioning museums and cultural spaces: Arquivo PÃºblico Mineiro (Minas Gerais Public Archive), Biblioteca PÃºblica Estadual Luiz de Bessa (Luiz de Bessa State Public Library), Cefar Liberdade, Centro de Arte Popular Cemig (Cemig Center of Popular Art), Centro Cultural Banco do Brasil (Culture Center Bank of Brazil), EspaÃ§o do Conhecimento UFMG (UFMG Knowledge Space), Horizonte Sebrae â Casa da Economia Criativa (Sebrae Horizon â The House of Creative Economy), Memorial Minas Gerais Vale (Minas Gerais Memorial), Museu das Minas e do Metal (Mines and Metal Museum), Museu Mineiro (Minas Gerais Museum) and PalÃ¡cio da Liberdade (Liberty Palace). Besides these, another three spaces are already in the process of being implemented: the Casa Fiat de Cultura (Fiat Culture House), CENA and Oi Futuro. The proposal, according to the Circuit manager, Cristiana Kumaira, is to strengthen the circuit in the world cultural context. &quot;We are already on this path and are being careful to ensure that the activities, services and assistance fulfill the needs and expectations of both the local population and the tourists who come to Belo Horizonte from around the world. The Circuit is establishing itself as one more source of pride for the people of Minas Gerais,&quot; she stresses.

Inaugurated in 2010, the Circuito Cultural PraÃ§a da Liberdade was created with the goal of exploring cultural diversity, with interactive options open to the public, in an area of great symbolic, historical and architectural value for Belo Horizonte. The opportunity came with the transference of the Minas Gerais Government headquarters to the Cidade Administrativa (Administrative City), in Serra Verde. After they had been adapted, the old department buildings opened their doors and began to house museums and cultural spaces.
The Circuito Cultural PraÃ§a da Liberdade is co-managed by the Instituto SÃ©rgio Magnani (Institute) since June 2012, through a partnership signed with the Minas Gerais Government, and the museums/spaces are mostly run by private companies, which carry out investments in heritage recovery and building maintenance. According to Kumaira, this public-private partnership model allows large companies to participate and effectively contribute to the cultural advance of the city. &quot;Beyond their fields of activities, the partners invest in the implantation and maintenance of museums, learning spaces, exhibition halls and shows, as well as memory centers that consolidate the history of Minas Gerais, presenting it either for free or at affordable prices,&quot; she adds.
The Natural History Museum and Botanical Garden holds an important treasure of folk art, the Nativity of Pipiripau. Created during the 20th century, the craftsman Raimundo Machado, synchronizes 586 figures, distributed in 45 scenes, which tell the story of life and death of Jesus, mixed with its variety of arts and crafts. With 600,000 sq. m. of green area, the UFMG Museum of Natural History and Botanic Garden (MHN-JB) is a privileged ecological space that enables visitors to experience nature in a rich, multidisciplinary way. For 30 years, the mission of the MHN-JB has been to do research, to educate, and to meet the community&#x27;s demand for service. It covers the areas of anthropology, archeology, Environmental Education, Natural History, Mineralogy, and Paleontology. It has an Ecological Amphitheater, a Free Art atelier, a greenhouse, and an Interactive Room. One of its traditional exhibitions is the Pipiripau Nativity CrÃ¨che.

PalÃ¡cio das Artes, inaugurated in 1970, comprises three theaters, three art galleries, a movie theater, a bookstore, a coffee shop and photography exhibition space. The building was designed by Oscar Niemeyer and it also houses the Minas Gerais Handcraft Center. The Pampulha Art Museum is located at the Pampulha Lake in Belo Horizonte in a building that originally housed the Pampulha Casino. The building was designed by Oscar Niemeyer, commissioned by the then-mayor and future president of Brazil Juscelino Kubitschek in the early 1940s, with external grounds by landscaper Roberto Burle Marx. The building was the first project of Oscar Niemeyer, opened as a casino, and closed in 1946. In 1957, it was re-opened as the Art Museum. His design was influenced by the principles of Le Corbusier. The gardens of Burle Marx are a tribute to the tropical green. There are three sculptures, by Ceschiatti, Zamoiski and JosÃ© Pedrosa. In 1996, it won new multimedia rooms, library, cafÃ© bar, a souvenir shop and technical infrastructure. The MAP has an impressive collection of 1,600 works.

===Architecture===
Belo Horizonte has several significant cultural landmarks, many of them situated in the Pampulha district, where there are notable examples of Brazilian contemporary architecture. Under the leadership of the then mayor of city, Juscelino Kubitschek, architects and artists such as Oscar Niemeyer, landscaper Burle Marx, and painter Candido Portinari, started a type of modern architecture and art here that was greatly developed later with the construction of Brazil&#x27;s new capital, BrasÃ­lia, also led by the now president Juscelino (aka JK). It is at the Pampulha complex that one can see the routes of this new architecture movement. The modern and protomodern architecture can also be seen all over Belo Horizonte, either in emblematic 1950s buildings such as Edificio Acaiaca, Conjunto JK, Hotel Amazonas and former Hotel Excelsior, all reflecting the modernity culture of the first planned capital of Brazil.

The Pampulha Park area includes one of the largest soccer stadiums in the world, the MineirÃ£o stadium, and the SÃ£o Francisco de Assis Church, widely known as Igreja da Pampulha, designed by Brazilian Modernist architect Oscar Niemeyer. In Pampulha there is also the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais campus, whose buildings themselves are important contributions to the city&#x27;s architecture. Other notable buildings include the Mesbla and Niemeyer buildings.

In the downtown area, landmarks include the SÃ£o JosÃ© Church, the PraÃ§a da EstaÃ§Ã£o (Station Square), which is an old train station that now is also the Museum of Arts and Workmanship, the Municipal Park, the famous Sete de Setembro Square, where an obelisk built in 1922 marks the one hundred years of Brazilian independence from Portugal. Near Central the area, in the Lourdes neighborhood, the Lourdes Basilica, is an example of Gothic Revival style. The Nossa Senhora de FÃ¡tima Church, in Santo Agostinho neighborhood, is situated in Carlos Chagas Square. Both churches are referred to as the AssemblÃ©ia Church and the AssemblÃ©ia Square because of their proximity to the state&#x27;s legislative assembly.

Next to the downtown region is the Savassi district, known for fine restaurants and as a centre of cultural events as well as the best of the city&#x27;s nightlife. Many landmarks are located there, such as the PraÃ§a da Liberdade (Liberty Square), and its surrounding buildings, including the former Executive Offices of the governor called the PalÃ¡cio da Liberdade (Liberty Palace), the first building to be finished during the city&#x27;s planned development in the late 1890s.

The government offices moved to the &quot;Cidade Administrativa&quot; in 2010. This complex is made by a few massive buildings just outside the city. Nowadays, the &quot;palaces&quot; are being turned into museums. Still on Savassi, the meeting point of many social groups, especially the youth, is &quot;PraÃ§a da Savassi&quot; (Savassi Square), which is not exactly a square, and more a crossing between two major avenues (GetÃºlio Vargas and CristÃ³vÃ£o Colombo), and gathers some of the busiest bars and pubs (called locally &quot;botecos&quot; or &quot;botequins&quot;) in town.

Another important landmark is PraÃ§a do Papa (Pope&#x27;s Square), located at a high point south of the downtown area, with its great view of the entire city. It is named for July 1, 1980, visit by John Paul II, who held a youth mass there. The nearby Parque das Mangabeiras (Mangabeiras Park) features extensive wildlife, and-owing to its considerable size-has its own bus service, which operates solely within the confines of the park. On Sundays, Afonso Pena Avenue hosts Latin America&#x27;s biggest open-air market. This is the Market of Arts and Handicrafts, most commonly known as Feira Hippie (hippie fair). Every Sunday morning 70,000 visitors find food, drinks, clothes, furniture, earrings, shoes and almost anything else.

===Food and drink===

The regional Minas Gerais&#x27; food and the now internationally known drink of cachaÃ§a are very popular and highly rated in the capital.

Belo Horizonte is internationally known as the &quot;capital of neighborhood bars.&quot;

Every year since 1999, the city hosts the Comida di Buteco festival (&quot;Pub Foods&quot;, in an approximate translation), in which a panel selects 41 bars to be visited, and then elects the one with the best appetizers using the theme ingredient of each year.

The Festival is so successful that its brand was already sold to other 21 regions in Brazil (BelÃ©m, Belo Horizonte, BrasÃ­lia, Campinas, Curitiba, FlorianÃ³polis, Fortaleza, GoiÃ¡s, Juiz de Fora, Manaus, Montes Claros, PoÃ§os de Caldas, Porto Alegre, Recife, RibeirÃ£o Preto, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, SÃ£o JosÃ© do Rio Preto, SÃ£o Paulo, UberlÃ¢ndia e Vale do AÃ§o).

The neighborhoods and areas of Savassi, Lourdes, Mercado Central, Santa Tereza and Pampulha concentrate most of the city&#x27;s restaurants and bars.

===Football===


As in the rest of Brazil, football is the most popular sport. The city&#x27;s major teams are AtlÃ©tico Mineiro, Cruzeiro and AmÃ©rica Mineiro.

The oldest stadium in the city is the Arena IndependÃªncia, built for the 1950 FIFA World Cup, and site of the so-called &quot;Miracle Match&quot;, when an amateur United States national soccer team beat heavy favourites England in an unexpected 1â0 win. It is currently the home ground of AmÃ©rica Mineiro.

The city has one of the biggest football stadiums in the world, officially called &quot;EstÃ¡dio Governador MagalhÃ£es Pinto&quot;, but widely known as MineirÃ£o. It was built to provide the city of Belo Horizonte with a larger alternative for the Arena IndependÃªncia, then the prime venue of the city. The stadium was meant to become the most modern stadium of Brazil and the new home of AtlÃ©tico Mineiro and Cruzeiro. Construction took almost five years, and officially opened on September 5, 1965. MineirÃ£o hardly changed in the following decades, and by the 1990s still had its original capacity. When Brazil won their bid to host the 2014 FIFA World Cup, it was clear that MineirÃ£o needed to undergo a large redevelopment.
The project included the complete reconstruction of the bottom tier, an extension of the roof, and further refurbishments to upgrade the stadium to FIFA standards. Building works took a total of three years and were completed in December 2012. The first match at the reopened MineirÃ£o was played on February 3, 2013, with a state championship match between Cruzeiro and AtlÃ©tico. MineirÃ£o hosted a total of six matches during the 2014 FIFA World Cup. The stadium also was one of the playing venues of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup and the Olympic football tournament in 2016.

While Cruzeiro agreed on a lease to play the next 25 years at MineirÃ£o, AtlÃ©tico decided to build its own arena in the CalifÃ³rnia neighbourhood, in the northeast region of the city. The original project intended to build one of the most modern football grounds in Latin America, and the second largest sports arena in the state of Minas Gerais, with a capacity of over 46,000 people. Construction kicked off in 2017, broke ground on April 20, 2020, after delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and works were completed in 2023. The stadium was inaugurated on April 15, 2023, and saw its first official match on August 27, 2023, with AtlÃ©tico Mineiro hosting Santos for the 2023 Campeonato Brasileiro SÃ©rie A. The naming rights for the stadium were sold to Belo Horizonte-based home building and real estate company MRV, and the location became known as Arena MRV.

In addition to football, Belo Horizonte has one of the largest attendances at volleyball matches in the entire country. They are played either at Mineirinho, home of Brazil&#x27;s national volleyball team, or at Minas TÃªnis Clube.

===Other sports===
Belo Horizonte is home to 2015 French Open men&#x27;s doubles champion and former World no. 1 doubles player Marcelo Melo as well as 2016 Australian Open men&#x27;s doubles and mixed doubles champion Bruno Soares.

The Minas TÃªnis Clube is a multi-sport club that plays in the Novo Basquete Brasil, Liga Nacional de Futsal, Brazilian Men&#x27;s Volleyball Superliga and Brazilian Women&#x27;s Volleyball Superliga.

<text>Sicyon (; ; &quot;gen&quot;.: Î£Î¹ÎºÏá¿¶Î½Î¿Ï) or SikyÅn was an ancient Greek city state situated in the northern Peloponnesus between Corinth and Achaea on the territory of the present-day regional unit of Corinthia. The ruins lie just west of the modern village of Sikyona (previously Vasiliko). An ancient monarchy at the times of the Trojan War, the city was ruled by a number of tyrants during the Archaic and Classical period and became a democracy in the 3rd century BC. Sicyon was celebrated for its contributions to ancient Greek art, producing many famous painters and sculptors. In Hellenistic times it was also the home of Aratus of Sicyon, the leader of the Achaean League.

==Ancient history==


Sicyon was built on a low triangular plateau about 3 kilometres (two miles) from the Corinthian Gulf. Between the city and its port lay a fertile plain with olive groves and orchards.

In Mycenean times, according to Eusebius, Sicyon had been ruled by a line of twenty-six mythical kings and then seven priests of Apollo. The king-list given by Pausanias comprises twenty-four kings, beginning with the autochthonous Aegialeus. The penultimate king of the list, Agamemnon, compels the submission of Sicyon to Mycenae; after him comes the Dorian usurper Phalces. Pausanias shares his source with Castor of Rhodes, who used the king-list in compiling tables of history; the common source was convincingly identified by Felix Jacoby as a lost &quot;Sicyonica&quot; by the late 4th-century poet Menaechmus of Sicyon.

After the Dorian invasion the city remained subject to Argos, whence its Dorian conquerors had come. The community was now divided into the ordinary three Dorian tribes and an equally privileged tribe of Ionians, besides which a class of serfs (, or , ) lived on and worked the land.

For some centuries the suzerainty of Argos remained, but after 676 BC Sicyon regained its independence under a line of tyrants called the Orthagorides after the name of the first ruler Orthagoras. The most important however was the founder&#x27;s grandson Cleisthenes, the grandfather of the Athenian legislator Cleisthenes, who ruled from 600 to 560 BC. Besides reforming the city&#x27;s constitution to the advantage of the Ionians and replacing Dorian cults with the worship of Dionysus, Cleisthenes gained a reputation as the chief instigator and general of the First Sacred War (590 BC) in the interests of the Delphians.

His successor Aeschines was expelled by the Spartans in 556 BC and Sicyon became an ally of the Lacedaemonians for more than a century. During this time, the Sicyonians developed the various industries for which they were known in antiquity. As the abode of the sculptors Dipoenus and Scyllis it gained pre-eminence in woodcarving and bronze work such as is still to be seen in the archaic metal facings found at Olympia. Its pottery, which resembled Corinthian ware, was exported with the latter as far as Etruria. In Sicyon also the art of painting was supposed to have been invented. After the fall of the tyrants their institutions survived until the end of the 6th century BC, when Dorian supremacy was re-established, perhaps by the agency of Sparta under the ephor Chilon, and the city was enrolled in the Peloponnesian League. Henceforth, its policy was usually determined either by Sparta or Corinth.

During the Persian Wars, the Sicyonians participated with fifteen triremes in the Battle of Salamis and with 3,000 hoplites in the Battle of Plataea. On the Delphic Serpent Column celebrating the victory Sicyon was named in fifth place after Sparta, Athens, Corinth and Tegea. In September 479 BC a Sicyonian contingent fought bravely in the Battle of Mycale, where they lost more men than any other city.

Later in the 5th century BC, Sicyon, like Corinth, suffered from the commercial rivalry of Athens in the western seas, and was repeatedly harassed by squadrons of Athenian ships. The Sicyonians fought two battles against the Athenians, first against their admiral Tolmides in 455 BC and then in a land battle against Pericles with 1000 hoplites in 453 BC.

In the Peloponnesian War Sicyon followed the lead of Sparta and Corinth. When these two powers quarrelled during the peace of Nicias, it remained loyal to the Spartans. At the reprise of the war, during the Athenian expedition in Sicily, the Sicyonians contributed 200 pressed hoplites under their commander Sargeus to the force that relieved Syracuse. At the beginning of the 4th century, in the Corinthian war, Sicyon sided again with Sparta and became its base of operations against the allied troops round Corinth.

In 369 BC Sicyon was captured and garrisoned by the Thebans in their successful attack on the Peloponnesian League. From 368 to 366 BC Sicyon was ruled by Euphron who first favoured democracy, but then made himself tyrant. Euphron was killed in Thebes by a group of Sicyonian aristocrats, but his compatriots buried him in his home town and continued to honour him like the second founder of the city.
During the 4th century BC, the city reached its zenith as a centre of art: its school of painting gained fame under Eupompus and attracted the great masters Pamphilus and Apelles as students, while Lysippus and his pupils raised the Sicyonian sculpture to a level hardly surpassed anywhere else in Greece. The tyrant Aristratus, a friend of the Macedonian royal family, had himself portrayed by the painter Melanthius aside the goddess of victory Nike on a chariot. In this period Sicyon was the undisputed center of Greek painting with its school attracting famous artists from all over Greece, including the celebrated Apelles and Pausias.

In 323 BC Euphron the Younger, a grandson of the tyrant Euphron, reintroduced a democracy, but was soon conquered by the Macedonians during the Lamian War. When the Macedonian commander Alexander was murdered in Sicyon in 314 BC, his wife Cratesipolis took control of the city and ruled it for six years, until she was induced by king Ptolemy I to hand it over to the Egyptians. Between 308 and 303 BC Sicyon was ruled by two Ptolemaic commanders, first Cleonides and then Philip.

In 303 BC Sicyon was conquered by Demetrius Poliorcetes who razed the ancient city in the plain and built a new wall on the ruins of the old Acropolis on the high triangular plateau which resulted sufficient for the reduced populace. The new agora was adorned by a &quot;Painted Stoa&quot; attributed to the king&#x27;s mistress Lamia, a flute player. For a short time the town was now called &quot;Demetrias&quot;, but eventually the old name prevailed.

Demetrius left a garrison in the castle to control the city, and the commander Cleon established another tyrannical regime. After some twenty years he was killed by two rivals, Euthydemus and Timocleidas, who became the new joint tyrants of Sicyon. Their rule ended, probably around the start of the Chremonidean War in 267 BC, when they were expelled by the people who elected their leader Cleinias to govern the city on a democratic ground. Two magistrates of these years were the hieromnemoi Sosicles and Euthydamos, known from an inscription at Delphi. The democratic government&#x27;s most important achievement was the construction of the gymnasium which is attributed to Cleinias. During the same time Xenokrates of Sicyon published his history of art which contributed to spreading the fame of Sicyon as an undisputed capital of ancient art.

Even this time democracy did not last more than a few years, and in 264 BC Cleinias was slain by his cognate Abantidas, who established his tyranny for twelve years. In 252 BC Abantidas was murdered by two rhetoricians, Aristotle the Dialectician and Deinias of Argos, and his father Paseas took over, only to be murdered after a short rule by another rival named Nicocles.

In 251, Aratus of Sicyon, the 20-year-old son of Cleinias, conquered the city with a night assault and expelled the last tyrant. Aratus re-established democracy, called back the exiles and brought his city into the Achaean League. This move ended the internal strife and Aratus remained the leading figure of Achaean politics until his death in 213 BC, during a period of great achievements. The prosperity and peaceful condition of Sicyon was only interrupted by an Aetolian raid in 241 BC and an unsuccessful siege at the hands of king Cleomenes III of Sparta in early 224 BC.

As a member of the Achaean federation Sicyon remained a stable democracy until the dissolution of the League by the Romans in 146 BC. In this period Sicyon was damaged by two disastrous earthquakes in 153 BC and 141 BC.

The destruction of Corinth (146 BC) brought Sicyon an acquisition of territory and the presidency over the Isthmian games; yet in Cicero&#x27;s time it had fallen deep into debt. Under the Roman empire it was quite obscured by the restored cities of Corinth and Patrae; in Pausanias&#x27; age (150 AD) it was almost desolate.
==Mentions in literary works==
In the 4th century BC the people of Sicyon were the subject of a popular comedy by Menander titled Sikyonioi.

William Shakespeare, in his 1606 play &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; (Act I, Scene 2), notes that Marc Antony&#x27;s wife, Fulvia died in Sicyon. Historically, she died there in 40 BC while in rebellion against Octavius Caesar.

Friedrich HÃ¶lderlin&#x27;s novel &quot;Hyperion&quot; from 1797 starts at the &quot;paradisiac plain of Sicyon&quot;.

== Medieval history ==
During the early Middle Ages, Sikyon continued to decline. It became a bishop&#x27;s seat and, judging by its later designation &quot;Hellas,&quot; it appears to have become a haven for populations seeking refuge from the settlement of Slavic groups in Greece during the 7th century. Following the Fourth Crusade, the settlement, then known as Vasilika (Basilikata), came under the control of the Principality of Achaia and became part of the prince&#x27;s domain. A castle was erected atop the ruined ancient acropolis by Prince William of Villehardouin (1246â1278), to complement the defenses of Corinth. By 1369, many villages in the vicinity of Vasilika were abandoned due to the raids of Turkish pirates. Together with Corinth, Vasilika was acquired by the Florentine in Angevin service NiccolÃ² Acciaioli, from whom it passed to Donato Acciaioli in 1362. Donato&#x27;s son Angelo Acciaioli mortgaged Corinth and Vasilika to his cousin Nerio I Acciaioli, the future duke of Athens, by 1372. When Nerio died in 1394, Corinth and Vasilika were inherited by his daughter, Francesca Acciaioli, who had recently married Carlo I Tocco, the count palatine of Cephalonia and Zante. These provisions were contested by Nerio&#x27;s other daughter, Bartolomea Acciaioli, and her husband, Despot Theodore I Palaiologos of the Morea. Following the ensuing conflict, Francesca and Carlo were only able to retain Vasilika and Megara, while Corinth passed to the Despot Theodore. Finally, Despot Theodore II Palaiologos of the Morea seized Vasilika in 1427, alongside other gains from the Principality of Achaia. The Ottoman Turks invaded and subjugated Corinth and Vasilika, alongside other northern Moreot towns and fortresses, in 1458, two years before completing the conquest of the Morea in 1460â1461.

A village named until 1920 &quot;Vasiliko&quot; (described by the 1911 &quot;EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica&quot; as &quot;insignificant&quot;) lies next to the site of ancient and medieval Sikyon. It is now named Sikyona, reflecting the name of the ancient city.

==Mythology: Identification with Mecone==
Sicyon has been traditionally identified with the mythical Mecone or Mekone, site of the trick at Mecone carried out by Prometheus. Mecone is also described by Callimachus as &quot;the seat of the gods&quot;, and as the place where the brother deities Zeus, Poseidon and Hades cast lots for what part of the world each would rule.

It is widely regarded as the most prestigious mathematical competition in the world. The first IMO was held in Romania in 1959. It has since been held annually, except in 1980. More than 100 countries participate. Each country sends a team of up to six students, plus one team leader, one deputy leader, and observers.

Awards are given to approximately the top-scoring 50% of the individual contestants. Teams are not officially recognizedâall scores are given only to individual contestants, but team scoring is unofficially compared more than individual scores.
==Question type==
The content ranges from extremely difficult algebra and pre-calculus problems to problems in branches of mathematics not conventionally covered in secondary or high school and often not at university level either, such as projective and complex geometry, functional equations, combinatorics, and well-grounded number theory, of which extensive knowledge of theorems is required. Calculus, though allowed in solutions, is never required, as there is a principle that anyone with a basic understanding of mathematics should understand the problems, even if the solutions require a great deal more knowledge. Supporters of this principle claim that this allows more universality and creates an incentive to find elegant, deceptively simple-looking problems which nevertheless require a certain level of ingenuity, often times a great deal of ingenuity to net all points for a given IMO problem.
==Selection process==

The selection process differs by country, but it often consists of a series of tests which admit fewer students at each progressing test. Contestants must be under the age of 20 and must not be registered at any tertiary institution. Subject to these conditions, an individual may participate any number of times in the IMO.

==History==

The first IMO was held in Romania in 1959. Since then it has been held every year (except in 1980, when it was cancelled due to internal strife in Mongolia). It was initially founded for eastern European member countries of the Warsaw Pact, under the USSR bloc of influence, but later other countries participated as well. Because of this eastern origin, the IMOs were first hosted only in eastern European countries, and gradually spread to other nations.

Sources differ about the cities hosting some of the early IMOs. This may be partly because leaders and students are generally housed at different locations, and partly because after the competition the students were sometimes based in multiple cities for the rest of the IMO. The exact dates cited may also differ, because of leaders arriving before the students, and at more recent IMOs the IMO Advisory Board arriving before the leaders.

Several students, such as Lisa Sauermann, Peter Scholze, Reid W. Barton, NicuÈor Dan and Ciprian Manolescu have performed exceptionally well in the IMO, winning multiple gold medals. Others, such as Terence Tao, Artur Avila, Grigori Perelman, NgÃ´ Báº£o ChÃ¢u, Peter Scholze and Maryam Mirzakhani have gone on to become notable mathematicians. Several former participants have won awards such as the Fields Medal.

Shortly after the 2016 International Mathematical Olympiad in Hong Kong, North Korean child prodigy Ri Jong-yol made his way to the South Korean consulate general, where he sought refuge for two months. Chinese authorities eventually allowed him to leave Hong Kong on a flight to Seoul. He legally changed his name to Lee Jung-ho (ì´ì í¸) after receiving South Korean citizenship. This is the only case of its kind in the IMO&#x27;s history.

==Scoring and format==
The competition consists of 6 problems. The competition is held over two consecutive days with 3 problems each; each day the contestants have four-and-a-half hours to solve three problems. Each problem is worth 7 points for a maximum total score of 42 points. Calculators are banned. Protractors were banned relatively recently. Unlike other science olympiads, the IMO has no official syllabus and does not cover any university-level topics. The problems chosen are from various areas of secondary school mathematics, broadly classifiable as geometry, number theory, algebra, and combinatorics. They require no knowledge of higher mathematics such as calculus and analysis, and solutions are often elementary. However, they are usually disguised so as to make the solutions difficult. The problems given in the IMO are largely designed to require creativity and the ability to solve problems quickly. Thus, the prominently featured problems are algebraic inequalities, complex numbers, and construction-oriented geometrical problems, though in recent years, the latter has not been as popular as before because of the algorithmic use of theorems like Muirhead&#x27;s inequality, and complex/analytic bashing to solve problems.

Each participating country, other than the host country, may submit suggested problems to a problem selection committee provided by the host country, which reduces the submitted problems to a shortlist. The team leaders arrive at the IMO a few days in advance of the contestants and form the IMO jury which is responsible for all the formal decisions relating to the contest, starting with selecting the six problems from the shortlist. The jury aims to order the problems so that the order in increasing difficulty is Q1, Q4, Q2, Q5, Q3 and Q6, where the first day problems Q1, Q2, and Q3 are in increasing difficulty, and the second day problems Q4, Q5, Q6 are in increasing difficulty. The team leaders of all countries are given the problems in advance of the contestants, and thus, are kept strictly separated and observed.

Each country&#x27;s marks are agreed between that country&#x27;s leader and deputy leader and coordinators provided by the host country (the leader of the team whose country submitted the problem in the case of the marks of the host country), subject to the decisions of the chief coordinator and ultimately a jury if any disputes cannot be resolved.

==Selection process==
The selection process for the IMO varies greatly by country. In some countries, especially those in East Asia, the selection process involves several tests of a difficulty comparable to the IMO itself. The Chinese contestants go through a camp. In others, such as the United States, possible participants go through a series of easier standalone competitions that gradually increase in difficulty. In the United States, the tests include the American Mathematics Competitions, the American Invitational Mathematics Examination, and the United States of America Junior Mathematical Olympiad/United States of America Mathematical Olympiad, each of which is a competition in its own right. For high scorers in the final competition for the team selection, there also is a summer camp, like that of China.

In countries of the former Soviet Union and other eastern European countries, a team has in the past been chosen several years beforehand, and they are given special training specifically for the event. However, such methods have been discontinued in some countries.

==Awards==
The participants are ranked based on their individual scores. Medals are awarded to the highest ranked participants; slightly fewer than half of them receive a medal. The cutoffs (minimum scores required to receive a gold, silver, or bronze medal respectively) are then chosen so that the numbers of gold, silver and bronze medals awarded are approximately in the ratios 1:2:3. Participants who do not win a medal but who score 7 points on at least one problem receive an honorable mention.

Special prizes may be awarded for solutions of outstanding elegance or involving good generalisations of a problem. This last happened in 1995 (Nikolay Nikolov, Bulgaria) and 2005 (Iurie Boreico), but was more frequent up to the early 1980s. The special prize in 2005 was awarded to Iurie Boreico, a student from Moldova, for his solution to Problem 3, a three variable inequality.

The rule that at most half the contestants win a medal is sometimes broken if it would cause the total number of medals to deviate too much from half the number of contestants. This last happened in 2010 (when the choice was to give either 226 (43.71%) or 266 (51.45%) of the 517 contestants (excluding the 6 from North Korea â see below) a medal), 2012 (when the choice was to give either 226 (41.24%) or 277 (50.55%) of the 548 contestants a medal), and 2013, when the choice was to give either 249 (47.16%) or 278 (52.65%) of the 528 contestants a medal. In these cases, slightly more than half the contestants were awarded a medal.

==Penalties and bans==
North Korea was disqualified twice for cheating, once at the 32nd IMO in 1991 and again at the 51st IMO in 2010. However, the incident in 2010 was controversial. There have been other cases of cheating where contestants received penalties, although these cases were not officially disclosed. (For instance, at the 34th IMO in 1993, a contestant was disqualified for bringing a pocket book of formulas, and two contestants were awarded zero points on second day&#x27;s paper for bringing calculators.)

Russia has been banned from participating in the Olympiad since 2022 as a response to its invasion of Ukraine. Nonetheless, a limited number of students (specifically, 6) are allowed to take part in the competition and receive awards, but only remotely and with their results being excluded from the unofficial team ranking. Slightly more than a half of the IMO 2021 Jury members (59 out of 107) voted in support of the sanction proposed by the IMO Board.

==Summary==





==Notable achievements==
===National===
The following nations have achieved the highest team score in the respective competition:

* China, 24 times: in 1989, 1990, 1992, 1993, 1995, 1997, 1999 (joint), 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2019 (joint), 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023;
* Russia (including Soviet Union), 16 times: in 1963, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1976, 1979, 1984, 1986 (joint), 1988, 1991, 1999 (joint), 2007;
* United States, 9 times: in 1977, 1981, 1986 (joint), 1994, 2015, 2016, 2018, 2019 (joint), 2024;
* Hungary, 6 times: in 1961, 1962, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1975;
* Romania, 5 times: in 1959, 1978, 1985, 1987, 1996;
* West Germany, twice: in 1982 and 1983;
* South Korea, twice: in 2012 and 2017;
* Bulgaria, once: in 2003;
* Iran, once: in 1998;
* East Germany, once: in 1968.

The following nations have achieved an all-members-gold IMO with a full team:

* China, 15 times: in 1992, 1993, 1997, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2019, 2021, 2022 and 2023.
* United States, 4 times: in 1994, 2011, 2016, and 2019.
* South Korea, 3 times: in 2012, 2017, and 2019.
* Russia, twice: in 2002 and 2008.
* Bulgaria, once: in 2003.

The only countries to have their entire team score perfectly in the IMO were the United States in 1994, China in 2022, and Luxembourg, whose 1-member team had a perfect score in 1981. The US&#x27;s success earned a mention in &quot;TIME Magazine&quot;. Hungary won IMO 1975 in an unorthodox way when none of the eight team members received a gold medal (five silver, three bronze). The second-place team, East Germany, also did not have a single gold medal winner (four silver, four bronze).

The current ten countries with the best all-time results are as follows:


===Individual===

Several individuals have consistently scored highly and/or earned medals on the IMO: Zhuo Qun Song (Canada) is the most highly decorated participant with five gold medals (including one perfect score in 2015) and one bronze medal. Reid Barton (United States) was the first participant to win a gold medal four times (1998â2001). Barton is also one of only eight four-time Putnam Fellows (2001â04). Christian Reiher (Germany), Lisa Sauermann (Germany), (Serbia), Nipun Pitimanaaree (Thailand) and Luke Robitaille (United States) are the only other participants to have won four gold medals (2000â03, 2008â11, 2009â12, 2010â13, 2011â14, and 2019â22 respectively); Reiher also received a bronze medal (1999), Sauermann a silver medal (2007), von Burg a silver medal (2008) and a bronze medal (2007), and Pitimanaaree a silver medal (2009). Wolfgang Burmeister (East Germany), Martin HÃ¤rterich (West Germany), Iurie Boreico (Moldova), and Lim Jeck (Singapore) are the only other participants besides Reiher, Sauermann, von Burg, and Pitimanaaree to win five medals with at least three of them gold. Ciprian Manolescu (Romania) managed to write a perfect paper (42 points) for gold medal more times than anybody else in the history of the competition, doing it all three times he participated in the IMO (1995, 1996, 1997). Manolescu is also a three-time Putnam Fellow (1997, 1998, 2000). Eugenia Malinnikova (Soviet Union) is the highest-scoring female contestant in IMO history. She has 3 gold medals in IMO 1989 (41 points), IMO 1990 (42) and IMO 1991 (42), missing only 1 point in 1989 to precede Manolescu&#x27;s achievement.

Terence Tao (Australia) participated in IMO 1986, 1987 and 1988, winning bronze, silver and gold medals respectively. He won a gold medal when he just turned thirteen in IMO 1988, becoming the youngest person to receive a gold medal (Zhuo Qun Song of Canada also won a gold medal at age 13, in 2011, though he was older than Tao). Tao also holds the distinction of being the youngest medalist with his 1986 bronze medal, followed by 2009 bronze medalist RaÃºl ChÃ¡vez Sarmiento (Peru), at the age of 10 and 11 respectively. Representing the United States, Noam Elkies won a gold medal with a perfect paper at the age of 14 in 1981. Both Elkies and Tao could have participated in the IMO multiple times following their success, but entered university and therefore became ineligible.

==Gender gap and the launch of European Girls&#x27; Mathematical Olympiad==
Over the years, since its inception to present, the IMO has attracted far more male contestants than female contestants. During the period 2000â2021, there were only 1,102 female contestants (9.2%) out of a total of 11,950 contestants. The gap is even more significant in terms of IMO gold medallists; from 1959 to 2021, there were 43 female and 1295 male gold medal winners.

This gender gap in participation and in performance at the IMO level led to the establishment of the European Girls&#x27; Mathematical Olympiad (EGMO).

==Media coverage==
* A documentary, &quot;Hard Problems: The Road To The World&#x27;s Toughest Math Contest&quot; was made about the United States 2006 IMO team.
* A BBC documentary titled &quot;Beautiful Young Minds&quot; aired July 2007 about the IMO.
* A BBC fictional film titled &quot;X+Y&quot; released in September 2014 tells the story of an autistic boy who took part in the Olympiad.
* A book named &quot;Countdown&quot; by Steve Olson tells the story of the United States team&#x27;s success in the 2001 Olympiad.

<doc id="82209" wikidata="Q426851" url="?curid=82209" title="Martinair">
<text>Martinair (legally &quot;Martinair Holland N.V.&quot;) is a Dutch cargo and former passenger airline headquartered and based at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. The airline was founded in 1958 by Martin SchrÃ¶der, and is currently a subsidiary of Air FranceâKLM. Since 2011, Martinair has operated entirely as a cargo airline with scheduled services to 20 destinations worldwide and additional charter flights. Prior to that date, passenger flights were also operated.

==History==
===Early years===

The airline was founded on 24 May 1958 as Martin&#x27;s Air Charter (MAC), by Martin SchrÃ¶der and John Block, with one aircraft, a de Havilland Dove, and five employees. In 1963 Mr. SchrÃ¶der sold 49% of the company to four equal shipping company shareholders (12.25% each, these eventually combining as Nedlloyd). KLM would later purchase the 50+% that Mr. SchrÃ¶der owned, buying him out.

The name was changed to Martinair Holland in 1966. A healthy boost came in 1967 with the opening of business to the United States. Martinair became all jet-powered in 1971.

In 1991, the first aircraft with the &quot;Martinair Cargo&quot; name was introduced, and &quot;Holland&quot; was dropped from all aircraft. In 1996, Martinair bought a 40% stake in Colombian cargo carrier TAMPA Cargo, based in MedellÃ­n, which was increased to 58% in 2003. The share in TAMPA was sold in February 2008 to Avianca, a Colombian company.

Martinair president and CEO Martin SchrÃ¶der, who received the &quot;Tony Jannus Award&quot; in 1995 for his contributions to commercial aviation, retired in 1998 from day-to-day activities. Also that year, the European Commission in Brussels refused KLM&#x27;s offer to purchase Nedlloyd&#x27;s shares, which would have made KLM the sole owner.

The first McDonnell Douglas MD-11 was delivered in December 1994. Throughout the next three years, six other brand-new MD-11s were delivered to Martinair. In total four McDonnell Douglas MD-11CFs (convertible freighter) and two full freighters were delivered. Martinair was the launch customer of the convertible freighter. In 2004 another MD-11F was added to the fleet, this one was previously owned by Swissair, and then converted to full freighter. From 1995 to 2006 some of the convertible MD-11 were reconfigured to transport passengers in the high passenger peaks during the summer period. The passenger configuration was fitted with 390 seats. After 2006 the demand lowered and Martinair no longer needed extra seats.

===Development since the 2000s===
In 2006 Martinair purchased four Boeing 747-400s from Singapore Airlines. These passenger planes were converted to freighters to replace the older Boeing 747-200Fs.

In June 2007, Martinair announced that it wanted one shareholder, preferably KLM, and in 2008 permission was obtained from the European Commission. The transfer of remaining shares took place on 31 December 2008. In November 2007, Martinair ceased its short-haul operations to concentrate on its cargo activities and intercontinental flights.

In 2009 three out of the four 747s were stored because of the economic crisis. In September 2010, a restructuring was announced which would involve dropping all passenger services from November 2011, which will be partly taken over by KLM, and leaving only cargo services. In November 2010, the European Commission fined Martinair â¬29.5 million, following an investigation into price-fixing.

At the end of 2010, two of the 747-400s were leased to Air Cargo Germany. The remaining 747 (PH-MPS) returned into service in May 2011 with an untitled colour scheme, because Martinair wasn&#x27;t sure yet if the plane would remain operating for them.

In October 2011, Martinair ceased passenger service, which it had operated since its founding in 1958. Martinair had passenger service throughout Europe, the Americas, Asia, and Africa from Amsterdam. The last passenger flight took place on 31 October 2011, leaving it as a freight carrier only until today.

In March 2015, Air France-KLM announced an intention to shrink their dedicated cargo operations. Therefore, all of Martinair&#x27;s McDonnell Douglas MD-11Fs were phased out by 2016 without replacement. Additionally, 330 jobs might be cut due to the downsizing.

==Corporate affairs==
===Offices===

Martinair has its head office in the TransPort Building, Schiphol East, on the grounds of Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, Haarlemmermeer, Netherlands. Martinair moved to its current head office on Friday 4 June 2010. The TransPort Building, developed by Schiphol Real Estate, houses both Martinair and Transavia, which moved into TransPort on 3 May 2010.

Construction on the building, which has of lettable space, began on 17 March 2009. Schiphol Group and the architect firm &quot;Paul de Ruiter&quot; designed the building, while De Vries and Verburg, a firm of Stolwijk, constructed the building. The Dutch Green Building Council awarded its first Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM-NL) certificate to Schiphol Real Estate for building the TransPort Building. In 2011 the United States Green Building Council awarded TransPort the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification. A parking facility is located beneath the TransPort building, with parking available by payment.

The airline previously occupied the Schiphol Center () at Schiphol Airport. After Martinair moved into the new building, Martinair sold its old head office back to the airport.

In addition to its headquarters at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, Martinair operates offices around the globe. The first international office has been opened in Hong Kong in 1975. &quot;Martinair USA&quot;, later &quot;Martinair Americas&quot; Originally operated in New York City, but the United States operations office moved to Boca Raton, Florida, in the Miami Metropolitan Area in 1993. This office moved again and is currently located in Doral, Florida, in the Miami area. This office is located in the Doral Corporate Center One.

===Subsidiaries===
The Martinair Flight Academy was a flight academy that was based at Lelystad Airport for both private pilot training and airline transport pilot training. It was moved to Groningen Airport in the spring of 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic to be integrated with the KLM Flight Academy. At the time when they moved to Groningen, MFA operated a fleet of four Socata TB-10s (registered PH-MLO, PH-MLQ, PH-MLR and PH-MLS), two Socata TB-20s (registered PH-MLK and PH-MLL) and a single Diamond DA-42NG Twin Star Platinum (registered PH-MFA), which was added to the fleet in 2011. Additional training was provided by an Alsim 200 FNPT-II MCC simulator.

Additionally, Martinair operates the Regional Jet Center, a technical service center for aircraft maintenance.

<doc id="82217" wikidata="Q354575" url="?curid=82217" title="Mark Evanier">
<text>Mark Stephen Evanier (; born March 2, 1952) is an American comic book and television writer, known for his work on the animated TV series &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot; and on the comic book &quot;Groo the Wanderer&quot;. He is also known for his columns and blog News from ME, and for his work as a historian and biographer of the comics industry, such as his award-winning Jack Kirby biography, &quot;&quot;.

==Early life==
Evanier identifies as Jewish. His father was Jewish and his mother was Catholic. He chose to be a writer after witnessing the misery his father felt from working for the Internal Revenue Service and contrasting that with the portrayal of a writer&#x27;s life on &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;. He graduated from University High School in 1969. Evanier attended UCLA but left before graduating.

==Career==
Evanier was president of a Los Angeles comic book club from 1966â69. In 1967, he suggested the titles of the officers of the Merry Marvel Marching Society. He made his first professional sale in 1969; that same year, through a mutual association with a Marvel Comics mail-order firm, he was taken on as a production assistant to Jack Kirby. Several years later Evanier began writing foreign comic books for the Walt Disney Studio Program, then from 1972 to 1976 wrote scripts for Gold Key Comics, including &quot;The Greatest of E&#x27;s&quot;, where he revealed that the E in Wile E. Coyote stands for &quot;Ethelbert&quot;, and comics for the Edgar Rice Burroughs estate.

In 1974, he teamed with writer Dennis Palumbo and wrote for a number of television series, including &quot;The Nancy Walker Show&quot;, &quot;The McLean Stevenson Show&quot;, and &quot;Welcome Back, Kotter&quot;, on which he was a story editor.
After leaving &quot;Kotter&quot; in 1977 and amicably ending his partnership with Palumbo, Evanier wrote for and eventually ran the Hanna-Barbera comic book division. He also wrote a number of variety shows and specials, and he began writing for animated cartoon shows, including &quot;Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo&quot;, &quot;The Plastic Man Comedy/Adventure Show&quot;, &quot;Thundarr the Barbarian&quot;, &quot;The ABC Weekend Special&quot;, &quot;Yogi Bear&#x27;s All Star Comedy Christmas Caper&quot;, &quot;Richie Rich&quot;, &quot;The Wuzzles&quot;, and &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. He is most noted in animation for his work on &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot;, a seven-season series for which Evanier wrote or co-wrote nearly every episode and acted as voice recording director. Since 2008, Evanier has been the co-writer and voice director of &quot;The Garfield Show&quot;, which won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program for June Foray.

Evanier credits himself with convincing Jack Kirby to stop using Vince Colletta as an inker, and he considers himself one of Colletta&#x27;s &quot;main vilifiers&quot;.

He wrote a script and provided &quot;&#x27;technical advice&#x27; about comic books&quot; for &quot;Bob&quot;, Bob Newhart&#x27;s unsuccessful third sitcom for CBS.

He has produced a number of comic books, including &quot;Blackhawk&quot;, &quot;Crossfire&quot; and &quot;Hollywood Superstars&quot; (with Dan Spiegle), &quot;Groo the Wanderer&quot; (with Sergio AragonÃ©s), and &quot;The DNAgents&quot; (with Will Meugniot). For the Spiegle comics, Evanier contributed lengthy essays on the entertainment industry. In 1985, he launched the &quot;DC Challenge&quot; limited series with artist Gene Colan. He wrote the &quot;New Gods&quot; series of 1989â1991. Evanier collaborated with Joe Staton on the &quot;Superman &amp; Bugs Bunny&quot; mini-series in 2000.

For many years, Evanier wrote a regular column, &quot;Point of View&quot;, for &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot;.

Evanier&#x27;s illustrated Jack Kirby biography, &quot;&quot;, was published in February 2008 by Abrams Books. It won the 2009 Eisner Award for Best Comics-Related Book. Evanier collaborated with AragonÃ©s and Thomas Yeates on the &quot;Groo vs. Conan&quot; crossover for Dark Horse Comics in 2014.

In 1970, Evanier attended the Golden State Comic Con in San Diego, the first annual gathering of what came to be known as San Diego Comic-Con. Evanier is one of a small group of people (estimated at six or fewer) who have attended every year. In 1973, he first hosted a panel at the yearly event and the volume soon escalated to the point where he was hosting as many as fourteen over a four-day convention. They usually include Quick Draw!, which pits fast cartoonists against one another to respond with drawings to challenges Evanier throws at them; the Annual Jack Kirby Tribute Panel, Cover Story (artists discussing the skills involved in creating covers for comic books), and several panels about the art of providing voices for animated cartoons. For years, he hosted the annual Golden Age Panel featuring artists and writers who&#x27;d worked in comic books in the 1940s but it ended after 2010 due to a lack of available panelists and was replaced by That 70&#x27;s Panel, celebrating comic book creators from that era. Evanier also serves as Administrator of the Bill Finger Award for Excellence in Comic Book Writing. Several of the panels he hosts at Comic-Con also appear at the annual WonderCon in Anaheim, California.

In April 2022, Evanier was reported among the more than three dozen comics creators who contributed to Operation USA&#x27;s benefit anthology book, &quot;Comics for Ukraine: Sunflower Seeds&quot;, a project spearheaded by IDW Publishing Special Projects Editor Scott Dunbier, whose profits would be donated to relief efforts for Ukrainian refugees resulting from the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

==Personal life==
On May 26, 2006, Evanier underwent gastric bypass surgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Having peaked at around 344 pounds (156 kg) by then, he subsequently lost nearly 99 pounds (45Â kg) by June 2007.

<doc id="82225" wikidata="Q93856" url="?curid=82225" title="Jockey Club">
<text>The Jockey Club is the largest commercial horse racing organisation in the United Kingdom. It owns 15 of Britain&#x27;s famous racecourses, including Aintree, Cheltenham, Epsom Downs and both the Rowley Mile and July Course in Newmarket, amongst other horse racing assets such as the National Stud, and the property and land management company, Jockey Club Estates. The registered charity Racing Welfare is also a company limited by guarantee with the Jockey Club being the sole member. As it is governed by Royal Charter, all profits it makes are reinvested back into the sport.

Formerly the regulator for the sport (&quot;Newmarket Rules&quot;), the Jockey Club&#x27;s responsibilities were transferred to the Horseracing Regulatory Authority (now the British Horseracing Authority) in 2006.

== History ==
The Jockey Club has long been thought to have been founded in 1750 â a year recognised by the club itself in its own records. Some claim it was created earlier, in the 1720s, while others suggest it may have existed in the first decade of the century. A notice of 1729 records that &quot;The Jockey Club, consisting of several Noblemen and Gentlemen, are to meet one Day next Week at Hackwood, the Duke of Bolton&#x27;s Seat in Hampshire, to consider of the Methods for the better keeping of their respective Strings of Horses at New Market.&quot; 

It was founded as one of the most exclusive high society social clubs in the United Kingdom, sharing some of the functions of a gentleman&#x27;s club such as high-level socialising. It was called &#x27;The Jockey Club&#x27; in reference to the late medieval word for &#x27;horsemen&#x27;, pronounced &#x27;yachey&#x27;, and spelt &#x27;Eachaidhe&#x27; in Gaelic. The club&#x27;s first meetings were held at the &quot;Star and Garter&quot; tavern in Pall Mall, London, before later moving to Newmarket; a town known in the United Kingdom as &quot;The Home of Racing&quot;. It was historically the dominant organisation in British horseracing, and it remained responsible for its day-to-day regulation until April 2006.

It passed its first resolution in 1758, that all riders must weigh in after a race.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, The Jockey Club had a clubhouse in Pall Mall, where many other gentlemen&#x27;s clubs were based. The fact that it acquired a governing role in the sport reflected the dominant role of the aristocracy in British horse racing up to the 20th century, and the removal of this role was in part a conscious effect to move the sport away from its patrician image. This can be compared with the way that cricket&#x27;s Marylebone Cricket Club became the governing body of cricket by default, but later surrendered most of its powers to more representative bodies.

The Jockey Club refused to grant training licences to women trainers until Florence Nagle, supported by the Fawcett Society sought legal redress. Initially she was unsuccessful until her fight finally reached the Court of Appeal in 1966. The Jockey Club used its considerable influence within the Establishment to twice block her appeal but her third appeal was successful, with the verdict of the three presiding law lords, Lord Denning, Lord Justice Dankwerts and Lord Salmon, being that &quot;If she is to carry on her trade without stooping to subterfuge she has to have a training licence.&quot; Of the Jockey Club itself, the Law Lords pronounced that &quot;The rights of a person to work should not be prevented by the dictatorial powers of a body which holds a monopoly.&quot; Faced with the court&#x27;s ruling, the Jockey Club was forced to capitulate, and on 3 August 1966, Nagle and Norah Wilmot became the first women in Britain to receive licences to train racehorses. On the same day, one of Wilmot&#x27;s horses won at Brighton Racecourse, making her the first official woman trainer of a winning horse.

The Jockey Club is the breed registry for North American thoroughbreds. In December 2024, twelve horse trainers, mostly those involved in doping horses, who failed in drug tests, were suspended from registering foals for 1-5 years according to the American Stud Book&#x27;s Rule 19, &quot;Principal Rules and Requirements&quot;.

==The new system==
Before 2006, it was one of the three bodies which provided management for horse racing in the United Kingdom in conjunction with the British Horseracing Board (itself an offshoot of The Jockey Club) and the Horserace Betting Levy Board.

These regulatory responsibilities were transferred to a new Horseracing Regulatory Authority (HRA) from 3 April 2006. This major re-organisation did not arise from a fundamental failure of the existing arrangements, but an understanding that the old system might not meet modern conditions. The HRA itself ceased to exist on 31 July 2007 as its regulatory duties were merged with the governing responsibility of the British Horseracing Board to create the new British Horseracing Authority.

In February 2023, the organisation dropped the formal dress code at all its 15 racecourses and 342 fixtures, except for the Queen Elizabeth II Stand at Epsom on Derby Day. The change was implemented as a way to make horse racing events more &quot;accessible and inclusive&quot;.

==Governance==
The Jockey Club is run by executives who report to the Board of Stewards (directors). The chairman of the board is called the Senior Steward. As of April 2024, there were nine Stewards, including the Senior Steward and Deputy Senior Steward. Individuals may be elected as Members, who &quot;are in effect &#x27;trustees&#x27;. However, they may not profit from their role, as all profits are invested into British racing.&quot; As of December 2017, there were 163 Members, including 24 Honorary Members.

<doc id="82226" wikidata="Q156652" url="?curid=82226" title="Thule Society">
<text>The Thule Society (; ), originally the (&#x27;Study Group for Germanic Antiquity&#x27;), was a German occultist and group founded in Munich shortly after World War I, named after a mythical northern country in Greek legend. The society is notable chiefly as the organization that sponsored the (DAP; German Workers&#x27; Party), which was later reorganized by Adolf Hitler into the National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party (NSDAP or Nazi Party). According to Hitler biographer Ian Kershaw, the organization&#x27;s &quot;membership list ... reads like a Who&#x27;s Who of early Nazi sympathizers and leading figures in Munich&quot;, including Rudolf Hess, Alfred Rosenberg, Hans Frank, Julius Lehmann, Gottfried Feder, Dietrich Eckart, and Karl Harrer.

Author Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke contends that Hans Frank and Rudolf Hess had been Thule members, but other leading Nazis had only been invited to speak at Thule meetings, or they were entirely unconnected with it. According to Johannes Hering, &quot;There is no evidence that Hitler ever attended the Thule Society.&quot;

==Origins==
The Thule Society was originally a &quot;German study group&quot; headed by Walter Nauhaus, a wounded World War I veteran turned art student from Berlin who had become a keeper of pedigrees for the Germanenorden (or &quot;Order of Teutons&quot;), a secret society founded in 1911 and formally named in the following year. In 1917, Nauhas moved to Munich; his &quot;Thule Society&quot; was to be a cover-name for the Munich branch of the Germanenorden, but events developed differently as a result of a schism in the order. In 1918, Nauhas was contacted in Munich by Rudolf von Sebottendorf (or von Sebottendorff), an occultist and newly elected head of the Bavarian province of the schismatic offshoot known as the Germanenorden Walvater of the Holy Grail. The two men became associates in a recruitment campaign, and Sebottendorff adopted Nauhas&#x27;s Thule Society as a cover-name for his Munich lodge of the Germanenorden Walvater at its formal dedication on 18 August 1918.

==Beliefs==
A primary focus of the Thule Society was a claim concerning the origins of the Aryan race. In 1917, people who wanted to join the &quot;Germanic Order&quot;, out of which the Thule Society developed in 1918, had to sign a special &quot;blood declaration of faith&quot; concerning their lineage:

The signer hereby swears to the best of his knowledge and belief that no Jewish or coloured blood flows in either his or in his wife&#x27;s veins, and that among their ancestors are no members of the coloured races.

&quot;Thule&quot; () was a land located by Greco-Roman geographers in the farthest north (often displayed as Iceland). The Latin term &quot;Ultima Thule&quot; is also mentioned by Roman poet Virgil in his pastoral poems called the &quot;Georgics&quot;. Thule originally was probably the name for Scandinavia, although Virgil simply uses it as a proverbial expression for the edge of the known world, and his mention should not be taken as a substantial reference to Scandinavia. The Thule Society identified Ultima Thule as a lost ancient landmass in the extreme north, near Greenland or Iceland, said by Nazi mystics to be the capital of ancient Hyperborea.

==Activities==
The Thule Society attracted about 1,500 followers in Bavaria, including 250 followers in Munich.

The followers of the Thule Society were very interested in racial theory and, in particular, in combating Jews and communists. Sebottendorff planned but failed to kidnap Bavarian socialist prime minister Kurt Eisner in December 1918. During the Bavarian revolution of April 1919, Thulists were accused of trying to infiltrate its government and of attempting a coup. On 26 April, the Communist government in Munich raided the society&#x27;s premises and took seven of its members into custody, executing them on 30 April. Amongst them were Walter Nauhaus and three aristocrats, including Countess Heila von Westarp, who functioned as the group&#x27;s secretary, and Prince Gustav of Thurn and Taxis, who was related to several European royal families. In response, the Thule organised a citizens&#x27; uprising as White troops entered the city on 1 May.

===&quot;MÃ¼nchener Beobachter&quot; newspaper===
In 1918, the Thule Society bought a local weekly newspaper, the &quot;MÃ¼nchener Beobachter&quot; (Munich Observer), and changed its name to &quot;MÃ¼nchener Beobachter und Sportblatt&quot; (Munich Observer and Sports Paper) in an attempt to improve its circulation. The &quot;MÃ¼nchener Beobachter&quot; later became the &quot;VÃ¶lkischer Beobachter&quot; (&quot;&quot;VÃ¶lkisch&quot; Observer&quot;), the main Nazi newspaper. It was edited by Karl Harrer.

===Deutsche Arbeiterpartei===
Anton Drexler had developed links between the Thule Society and various extreme-right workers&#x27; organizations in Munich. He established the &quot;Deutsche Arbeiterpartei&quot; (DAP; German Workers&#x27; Party) on 5 January 1919, together with the Thule Society&#x27;s Karl Harrer. Adolf Hitler joined this party in September of the same year. By the end of February 1920, the DAP had been reconstituted as the &quot;Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei&quot; (NSDAP; National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party), often referred to as the Nazi Party.

Sebottendorff, by then, had left the Thule Society and never joined the DAP or the Nazi Party. Dietrich Bronder (&quot;Bevor Hitler kam&quot;, 1964) alleged that other members of the Thule Society were later prominent in Nazi Germany: the list includes Dietrich Eckart (who coached Hitler on his public speaking skills, along with Erik Jan Hanussen, and had &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; dedicated to him), as well as Gottfried Feder, Hans Frank, Hermann GÃ¶ring, Karl Haushofer, Rudolf Hess, Heinrich Himmler, and Alfred Rosenberg. Historian Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke has described this membership roll and similar claims as &quot;spurious&quot; and &quot;fanciful&quot;, noting that Feder, Eckart, and Rosenberg were never more than guests to whom the Thule Society extended hospitality during the Bavarian revolution of 1918, although he has more recently acknowledged that Hess and Frank were members of the society before they came to prominence in the Nazi Party. It has also been claimed that Adolf Hitler himself was a member. Evidence on the contrary shows that he never attended a meeting, as attested to by Johannes Hering&#x27;s diary of society meetings. It is quite clear that Hitler himself (unlike Himmler, for example) had little interest in, and made little time for, &quot;esoteric&quot; matters.

Wilhelm Laforce and Max Sesselmann (staff on the &quot;MÃ¼nchener Beobachter&quot;) were Thule members who later joined the NSDAP.

==Dissolution==
Early in 1920, Karl Harrer was forced out of the DAP as Hitler moved to sever the party&#x27;s link with the Thule Society, which subsequently fell into decline and was dissolved about five years later, well before Hitler came to power.

Rudolf von Sebottendorff had withdrawn from the Thule Society in 1919, but he returned to Germany in 1933, hoping to revive it. In that year, he published a book entitled &quot;Bevor Hitler kam&quot; (&quot;Before Hitler Came&quot;), in which he claimed that the Thule Society had paved the way for the FÃ¼hrer: &quot;Thulers were the ones to whom Hitler first came, and Thulers were the first to unite themselves with Hitler.&quot; The Nazi authorities did not favourably receive this claim: after 1933, esoteric organisations were suppressed (including &quot;vÃ¶lkisch&quot; occultists), and many were closed down by anti-Masonic legislation in 1935. Sebottendorff&#x27;s book was prohibited, and he was arrested and imprisoned for a short period in 1934 after departing into exile in Turkey.

Nonetheless, it has been argued that some Thule members and their ideas were incorporated into Nazi Germany. Some of the Thule Society&#x27;s teachings were expressed in the books of Alfred Rosenberg. Many occult ideas found favour with Heinrich Himmler, who had a great interest in mysticism, unlike Hitler, but the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) under Himmler emulated the structure of Ignatius Loyola&#x27;s Jesuit order rather than the Thule Society, according to Hohne.

==Conspiracy theories==
The Thule Society has become the center of many conspiracy theories concerning Nazi Germany due to its occult background (like the Ahnenerbe section of the SS). Such theories include the creation of vril-powered Nazi UFOs.

<text>The Knarr is a Norwegian sailboat that was designed in 1943 by Erling Kristoffersen as a racer, with the first production boat delivered in 1946. It is named for the Norse class of trading ships, the Knarr.

==Production==
The design was initially built at GrimsÃ¸ykilen Boat Yard and Kilen Boat Yard in Norway and later by BÃ¸rresen BÃ¥debyggeri in Denmark. In 2004 production passed to Bootswerft Schneidereit of Germany, but that company ceased building boats on 31 May 2018 and it is now out of production. A total of 450 boats were produced.

==Development==
The design&#x27;s concept dates to before 1940, when Willy H. Johannesen and Lars WallÃ¸e contacted Kristofersen about designing a replacement for the Nordic Folkboat, which was considered an ugly boat design in Norway. Kristofersen was approached due to having already designed other successful racing sailboats. With Norway under German occupation in the Second World War, work was slow and the design was not completed until 1943. The choice of iron for the keel was dictated by wartime restrictions making lead unobtainable.

Work on the prototype started in 1944 at Einar Iversen&#x27;s property in GrimsÃ¸y, near Sarpsborg, which later grew into GrimsÃ¸ykilen Boat Yard. The Germans imposed strict regulations on boatbuilding and sailing during the war, but Iversen was allowed to continue work, by promising the first boat to the Germans. He claimed that the prototype as completed was too flawed and promised the Germans the second one, which was constructed in the winter of 1944-45. The occupation of Norway ended before the German boat was delivered and the first production boats were delivered in 1946.

==Design==
The Knarr is a recreational keelboat that was initially built of mahogany or fir wood on a hull-shaped last. Wooden construction avoided the use of strategic materials during the Second World War. In 1974 the design was converted by BÃ¸rresen BÃ¥debyggeri to fiberglass construction, with wooden trim, starting with hull number 129. The fiberglass version preserves the weight and balance of the wooden version.

The boat has a fractional sloop rig, initially with spruce wood spars and later with aluminum. The forestay set well aft of the bow. The hull has a spooned, raked stem; a raised counter, angled transom; a keel-mounted rudder controlled by a tiller and a fixed fin keel. It displaces and carries of iron ballast.

The boat has a draft of with the standard keel. For sailing the design is equipped with only a mainsail and jib, no spinnaker.

The design has a Portsmouth Yardstick racing average handicap of 91.0 and is normally raced by a crew of three to four sailors.

==Operational history==
The boat is supported by three active class clubs that organize racing events, the &quot;Norsk Knarrklubb&quot; founded in 1951 in Norway, the &quot;Dansk Knarr Klub&quot; formed in 1955 in Denmark and the &quot;Knarr Class of San Francisco Bay&quot; in the United States.

 there were racing fleets in Norway, Denmark and San Francisco Bay, with some boats also located in Germany and France. In 1968, the national clubs created an International Knarr Championship, which is held sequentially in Oslo and Bergen, Norway, San Francisco and Denmark.

The design was introduced to San Francisco in 1953 by Einar Iversen&#x27;s son, BjÃ¸rn Iversen, who was attending Stanford University. The design proved well-suited to the windy conditions and the chop of San Francisco Bay and gained a following there.

In 1966, the Knarr &quot;Irina&quot; was sailed by Georg V. Erpecom Jr. from Bergen to the Centenary Regatta in Copenhagen and then to Oslo, the longest voyage that had been sailed by a Knarr up until that time. Erpecom was awarded the Royal Norwegian Yacht Club&#x27;s &quot;Cruise Racing Trophy&quot; for the trip.

In 1967 the Royal Danish Yacht Club presented Margrethe II of Denmark and Prince Henrik a Knarr as a wedding gift.

<doc id="82229" wikidata="Q19891" url="?curid=82229" title="Metropolitan line">
<text>The Metropolitan line, colloquially known as the Met, is a London Underground line between in the City of London and and in Buckinghamshire, with branches to in Hertfordshire and in Hillingdon. Printed in magenta on the tube map, the line is in length and serves 34 stations (13 of which are step free to platform). Between Aldgate and , the track is mostly in shallow &quot;cut and cover&quot; tunnels, apart from short sections at and Farringdon stations. The rest of the line is above ground, with a loading gauge of a similar size to those on main lines. Just under passenger journeys were made on the line in 2019.

This line is one of just two Underground lines to cross the Greater London boundary and proceed outwards into the Home Counties, the other being the Central line. It is the only Underground line with an express service at peak times; the resulting longer distance between stations means trains can achieve the system&#x27;s highest speeds of up to on some sections.

In 1863, the Metropolitan Railway was the world&#x27;s first underground railway. It first ran between Paddington and , with wooden carriages and steam locomotives, subsequently extending north-westwards into the Middlesex countryside, where it stimulated the development of new suburbs. Harrow was reached in 1880, and ultimately the line continued as far as in Buckinghamshire, more than from . From the end of the 19th century, the railway shared tracks with the Great Central Railway out of . The central London lines were electrified by 1907 but electric locomotives were exchanged for steam locomotives on trains heading north of Harrow. After the railway was absorbed by the London Passenger Transport Board in 1933, the line was cut back to . Steam trains ran until 1961, when the line was electrified to and services were curtailed at Amersham. The Hammersmith &amp; City line was shown on the tube map as a part of the Metropolitan line until 1990, when it appeared as a separate line. The current S8 Stock trains entered service between 2010 and 2012, replacing the A Stock trains, that served the line since 1961.

The section between Aldgate and Baker Street is shared with the Circle line; between Liverpool Street and Baker Street with the Hammersmith &amp; City line; between and Uxbridge with the Piccadilly line; and between and Amersham with the LondonâAylesbury line operated by Chiltern Railways. Baker Street is the southbound terminus for some trains not continuing to Aldgate. Most of the route has two tracks, except for the single-track Chesham branch and a four-track section between and that allows fast and semi-fast services to overtake &quot;all stations&quot; trains. There are four tracks between Wembley Park and Finchley Road, but only the outer ones are used by the Metropolitan line&#x27;s non-stop trains: the inner pair was transferred to the Bakerloo line in 1939 (becoming the Jubilee line in 1979) with services calling at all stations.

== History ==

=== Metropolitan Railway ===
The Metropolitan Railway, also known as &quot;the Met&quot;, was a passenger and goods railway that served London from 1863 to 1933, its main line heading north-west from the City to what were to become the Middlesex suburbs. Its first line connected the mainline railway termini at , and King&#x27;s Cross to the City, built beneath the New Road using the cut-and-cover method between Paddington and King&#x27;s Cross, and in tunnel and cuttings beside Farringdon Road from King&#x27;s Cross to near Smithfield. The world&#x27;s first underground railway, it opened on 10 January 1863 with gas-lit wooden carriages hauled by steam locomotives. The line operated at a frequency of three trains per hour, rising to four trains per hour during the peak periods. In the 1871 plans for an underground railway in Paris, it was called the &quot;MÃ©tropolitain&quot;.

The railway was soon extended from both ends and northwards via a branch from Baker Street. It reached Hammersmith in 1864 and Richmond in 1877; it completed the &quot;Inner Circle&quot; in 1884, but the most important route became the line west and north-west into the Middlesex countryside, where it stimulated the development of new suburbs. Harrow was reached in 1880, and ultimately, as far as in Buckinghamshire, more than from Baker Street. From the end of the 19th century, the railway shared tracks with the Great Central Railway route out of .
Electric traction was introduced in 1905 with electric multiple units operating between Uxbridge, Harrow-on-the-Hill and Baker Street. To remove steam and smoke from the tunnels in central London, the railway purchased electric locomotives, exchanged for steam locomotives at Harrow from 1908. In 1910, a seventeen-minute silent film was made showing large portions of the journey from Baker Street to Aylesbury and Uxbridge, seen from the cab of a train.

Unlike other railways in the London area, the Met developed land for housing, thus benefitting from the increase in the value of its land caused by the building of the railway. After World War I it promoted its housing estates near the railway with the &quot;Metro-land&quot; brand.

To improve services, more powerful electric and steam locomotives were purchased in the 1920s. A short branch opened from Rickmansworth to Watford in 1925. After World War I, the Stanmore branch was built from Wembley Park.

=== London Transport ===
On 1 July 1933, the Metropolitan was amalgamated with other Underground railways, tramway companies and bus operators to form the London Passenger Transport Board, and a period of rationalisation followed.

While the Metropolitan was run as an outer suburban route with steam-hauled trains and goods services, the LPTB wished to focus on electrified trains and suburban traffic. Goods services were passed to the London and North Eastern Railway, which also took over the role of providing steam locomotives for trains beyond the end of electrification at Rickmansworth. All services north-west of were withdrawn by 1936 though services returned to between 1943 and 1948.

The 1930s was a period of rapid growth for the north-western suburbs of London, and LPTB developed ambitious plans to simplify the Metropolitan line and expand capacity. Several stations on the Uxbridge branch were rebuilt, replacing temporary wooden buildings with modernist designs and giving Uxbridge station a new site in the town centre. A major bottleneck in the line, the double-track tunnel from Baker Street to Finchley Road, was bypassed by boring two tube tunnels underneath the Metropolitan tunnels, transferring slow services and the Stanmore branch to the Bakerloo line. (This route was transferred to the Jubilee line in 1979.) In 1936, the line was extended east from to along the tracks of the District line. London Transport inherited incompatible electric multiple units from the railway, including the 1927â33 multiple-unit compartment stock used on routes to Watford and Rickmansworth, and these were refurbished to form a uniform fleet and designated London Underground T Stock. In the 1950s, F Stock trains, with sliding doors under the control of the guard, were transferred from the District line; these mainly worked the semi-fast Harrow and Uxbridge services.
A major rebuilding of the main line from Wembley Park to Amersham was planned in the 1930s but delayed by the war. The line from Wembley to Harrow was rebuilt immediately after the war and the project was completed from 1956 to 1962, on a more modest scale than originally planned. Until 1961, passenger trains continued to be attached to a steam locomotive at to run to Aylesbury. The rebuilding electrified the line from Rickmansworth to Amersham, transferring all Aylesbury services to British Railways. A pair of fast lines was added from Harrow to north of Moor Park by 1962, allowing outer-suburban trains to run fast to Moor Park. Aluminium A stock, originally unpainted, replaced the T stock and locomotive-hauled trains. More A Stock trains were built in 1962â63 to replace the trains on the Uxbridge service, giving the main line a single train type for all services. A Stock was four-car units that could operate as four- or eight-car trains; normally operated as eight cars, a four-car unit operated the Chesham shuttle. One person operation of the trains was proposed in 1972, but due to conflict with the trade unions was not introduced on the line until 1986.

=== A separate identity ===

Although the East London line had been an isolated shuttle since 1939, it was shown on London Underground maps as part of the Metropolitan line until 1968. In 1970, it was shown with a thin white line in the middle and labelled the &quot;East London section&quot;. By the 1985 map, it had become the &quot;East London Line&quot;, remaining the same colour as the Metropolitan line with a white line in the middle, changed to orange by the 1990 map. In 1990, the Hammersmith &amp; City line became a separate line from Hammersmith to Whitechapel (Barking during the peak), the Metropolitan line being from Aldgate to Baker Street and northwards to Amersham with branches to Chesham, Uxbridge and Watford.

In 2003, the infrastructure was partly privatised in a publicâprivate partnership managed by the Metronet consortium. Metronet entered administration in 2007 and Transport for London took over responsibilities.

On 12 December 2010, the service to Amersham was reduced from four trains per hour to two, and a direct service between Chesham and central London was introduced, replacing the 4-car Chesham to Chalfont &amp; Latimer shuttle. The final passenger services operated by the A Stock ran on 26 September 2012, followed by a ticketed public railtour on 29 September.

== Route ==
The Metropolitan line is long and serves 34 stations. It is electrified with a four-rail DC system: a central conductor rail is energised at â250Â V and a rail outside the running rail at +500Â V, giving a potential difference of 750Â V, except for the section from Uxbridge to Finchley Road (via Harrow-on-the-Hill) which is energised atÂ â210Â V and +420Â V respectively (630Â V potential difference) to maintain compatibility with 1973 Stock and 1996 Stock that runs in those areas. The first from Aldgate are below ground, shared with the Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City lines to Baker Street, where the line diverges, remaining in tunnel until Finchley Road. Metropolitan line trains essentially skip two stops between Baker Street and Finchley Road, with the Jubilee line serving the intermediate stations on an adjacent parallel line. The Jubilee line then joins the Metropolitan line in the same right-of-way at Finchley Road. Metropolitan line trains then run express from Finchley Road to Wembley Park, with the Jubilee line serving the intermediate stations. Metropolitan line platforms at and remain for emergency use. At Wembley Park the Jubilee line diverges to the Stanmore branch at a grade-separated junction. From just after Finchley Road, these four tracks run parallel with the Network Rail Chiltern Main Line from Marylebone.

Between Wembley Park and Harrow-on-the-Hill, the Metropolitan is four-track, with fast and slow lines paired by direction, paralleling the two-track un-electrified LondonâAylesbury line. The slow lines are between the fast lines, and the two intermediate stations have island platforms. Harrow-on-the-Hill has platforms on all six lines. The central slow lines diverge here at a grade-separated junction to become the Uxbridge branch. After West Harrow, at Rayners Lane the line is joined by the Piccadilly line, which shares the tracks to Uxbridge; a turnback siding allows some Piccadilly line services to terminate at Rayners Lane.

On the main line between Harrow-on-the-Hill and Moor Park, the line is four-track, paired by use. The western fast tracks are shared with Aylesbury line services from Marylebone; the eastern slow tracks have platforms at the intermediate stations.

North of Moor Park, the Watford branch diverges from the slow lines. This double-track branch has stations at Croxley and Watford. The Watford branch has a triangle junction with the main line, with a north-facing curve between and . This route, Watford North Curve, is used daily for a few services and empty stock movements.

From the Watford triangle to Amersham, the line has two tracks. At Chalfont &amp; Latimer, the single-track Chesham branch diverges, running parallel to the main line for a distance. The Metropolitan line ends at Amersham, where there are turnback sidings just beyond the platforms. The route continues to Aylesbury with Chiltern Railways trains only.

The fast (non-stopping) lines between Wembley Park and Harrow on the Hill are signalled with LUL signalling, but using four-aspect Network Rail signal heads. The upper two lights are a two-aspect stop signal displaying either a green or red aspect, the lower two lights a repeater signal for the next stop signal ahead showing a green or yellow aspect, or no aspect when the stop signal shows a red aspect. Thus they are effectively four-light three-aspect signals with green/red/green/yellow lights from the top, danger being a single red light, caution the top green light over a yellow light, and clear two green lights.

The Metropolitan line&#x27;s suburban rail character opposed to other London Underground lines is also shown by the long distances between stops. Eight of the top 10 furthest apart stations on the Underground are on the Metropolitan line. The section between Chalfont &amp; Latimer and Chesham is the longest at , whilst the Finchley Road to Wembley Park section is the second longest, and Rickmansworth to Chorleywood the fourth longest overall.

==Services==
The Metropolitan line is the only London Underground line to operate non-stop services through some of its stations, although since 11 December 2011 these only run on weekdays during peak times (southbound in the morning peak, northbound in the evening peak). Depending on the stopping pattern, services are advertised as either &quot;all-stations&quot;, &quot;semi-fast&quot; or &quot;fast&quot; on platform information boards and on-train announcements. The stopping pattern of each type of service is as follows:
*&quot;All-stations&quot; services call at all stations en route
*&quot;Semi-fast&quot; services run non-stop between and , and call at all other stations en route
*&quot;Fast&quot; services run non-stop between Wembley Park and Harrow-on-the-Hill and between Harrow-on-the-Hill and 
*In the southbound direction, &quot;fast&quot; and &quot;semi-fast&quot; trains do not usually call at Wembley Park, and instead run non-stop from Harrow-on-the-Hill to 

Owing to the track layout, &quot;fast&quot; services can only run to/from or . The branch diverges from the rest of the line before the &quot;fast&quot; section, while the branch is not directly connected with the fast line at Moor Park.

No Metropolitan line trains call at any intermediate stations between Finchley Road and Wembley Park. These stations are served by the Jubilee line which runs parallel to the Metropolitan line along this section.

===Frequency===

During the off-peak the service pattern on the line, in trains per hour (tph), is as follows:
*8tph - (all stations);
*4tph - (all stations);
*2tph - (all stations);
*2tph - (all stations).

These services combine to give a total frequency of 16tph between Baker Street and Harrow-on-the-Hill. Of these, 12tph run between Aldgate and Baker Street which, together with the 6tph frequencies on both the Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City lines, gives a total of 24 trains every hour on the central-London section between Liverpool Street and Baker Street.

In the morning peak, the southbound service pattern is strengthened to the following:
*4tph - (all stations);
*6tph - (4 all stations, 2 semi-fast);
*6tph - (3 all stations, 3 semi-fast);
*2tph - (1 all stations, 1 semi-fast);
*4tph - (2 semi-fast, 2 fast)
*2tph - (fast).

The northbound frequencies in the morning peak are similar on each route, except most trains run as &quot;all-stations&quot; services.

Similarly, in the evening peak, the northbound service pattern is strengthened to the following:
*3tph - (all stations);
*7tph - (all stations);
*4tph - (2 all stations, 2 semi-fast)
*4tph - (semi-fast);
*2tph - (semi-fast);
*2tph - (fast);
*2tph - (fast).

The southbound frequencies in the evening peak are similar on each route, except all trains run as &quot;all-stations&quot; services.

== Rolling stock ==
Since 20 September 2012, all services have been provided by eight-car S Stock trains introduced in July 2010 to replace the 1960s A Stock. Part of Bombardier&#x27;s Movia family, they have air-conditioning, feasible because the sub-surface tunnels, unlike tube tunnels, are able to disperse the exhausted hot air. They have regenerative brakes, returning around 20% of their energy to the network and thus reducing energy consumption. With fewer seats than the older A StockÂ â 306 compared with 448 â they can accommodate 697 standing passengers, compared with 597 in A Stock, and have dedicated space for wheelchairs. They have a top speed of , being the only London Underground stock to travel at that speed, doing so on the long-distance sections north of Finchley Road.

There are 58 S8 Stock trains in operation, as well as one eight-car S7 Stock also called &#x27;S7+1&#x27; â which retains the all-longitudinal seating of the normal seven-car S7 Stock that is operated on London Underground&#x27;s other sub-surface lines.

== Depot ==

The line is served by a depot at Neasden. The Metropolitan Railway opened a carriage works at Neasden in 1882 and the following year the locomotive works were moved from Edgware Road. In 1904â05, the depot was refitted to take the new electric multiple units and accommodation enlarged in 1932â3. After the amalgamation into the LTPB, the depot was rebuilt from 1936 to 1939. The depot was upgraded in 2010â11 to enable it to maintain S Stock trains. Trains are also stored overnight at Uxbridge, Watford, Rickmansworth and Wembley Park.

== Steam on the Met ==

In 1989, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the opening of the Metropolitan to Chesham, the first Steam on the Met event took place with London Underground running two weekends of steam specials between Chesham and Watford. The event was a success and so in 1990 London Underground ran steam between Harrow and Amersham. In 1992, to celebrate 100Â years of the Met at Amersham, the event was extended to five days at the end of May. From 1994, diesel locomotive 20227, owned by the Class 20 Locomotive Society, and electric locomotive Sarah Siddons provided air braking for the coaches. In 1995, trains ran between Amersham and Watford.

Engines used included BR standard class 5 and BR standard class 4 and GWR Pannier tanks. There was other rolling stock on static display at Rickmansworth sidings. The steam trains ran between normal Metropolitan and main line services. Due to the imminent partial privatisation of LUL and the stock condition, the last steam excursion took place in 2000. In 2008, special trains ran on using Metropolitan Railway electric locomotive &quot;Sarah Siddons&quot; and diesel Class 20 locomotives.

To celebrate the 150th anniversary of the opening of the Metropolitan, special services ran in January 2013 using a restored 1892 &quot;Jubilee&quot; carriage, 1898â1900 Ashbury and Cravens bogie carriages, Metropolitan Railway milk van No.3, Metropolitan Railway E Class steam locomotive No. 1 and electric locomotive &quot;Sarah Siddons&quot;. Further events were planned for 2013 involving Locomotive No. 1, &quot;Sarah Siddons&quot; and the Jubilee carriage, including a &quot;Steam back on the Met&quot; scheduled for May.

== Four Lines Modernisation (4LM) ==
It was planned that a new signalling system would be used first on the line north of Baker Street from the end of 2016, but signalling contractor Bombardier was released from its contract by agreement in December 2013 amid heavy criticism of the procurement process and London Underground subsequently awarded the contract for the project to Thales in August 2015.

With the introduction of S8 Stock, the track, electrical supply, and signalling systems are being upgraded in a programme planned to increase peak-hour capacity on the line by 27 per cent by the end of 2023. A single control room for the sub-surface railway opened at Hammersmith on 6 May 2018, and communications-based train control (CBTC) provided by Thales will progressively replace &#x27;fixed block&#x27; signalling equipment dating back the 1940s. Trackside signals with automatic train protection (ATP) will remain on the line north of Harrow-on-the-Hill, shared with Chiltern Railways DMUs.

The rollout of CBTC has been split into sections, each known as a signal migration area (SMA).

Work on the SMAs north of Finchley Road were delayed in November 2023 because of the complexity of Neasden Depot (shared with the Jubilee Line) and challenges relating to the inter-operability with Chiltern Railways which shares tracks with the Metropolitan line in this area.

== List of stations ==
=== Open stations ===
&quot;In order from east to west.&quot;
=== Former stations ===
The Brill Tramway with stations , , , , and closed in 1935. In the following year, the line was cut back to Aylesbury, with Waddesdon station and , stations on the line to Verney Junction closing. Initially and Quainton Road remained open, with main line services provided by the LNER.

In 1939, the Stanmore branch and the stopping service between Finchley Road and Wembley Park were transferred to the Bakerloo line. On the St John&#x27;s Wood section, Lord&#x27;s and Marlborough Road stations were replaced by St John&#x27;s Wood, and Swiss Cottage replaced the Metropolitan line station. The Bakerloo line service to Stanmore was transferred to the Jubilee line when that line opened in 1979.

In 1961, when steam locomotives were replaced and the line was electrified to Amersham, the Underground service to Great Missenden, Wendover, Stoke Mandeville and Aylesbury was withdrawn.

=== Goods-only branches ===
Between Moor Park and Croxley, a short branch ran south-east off the Watford branch, near its junction with the main line, to Croxley Tip, a rubbish dump beside the Grand Union Canal. This site began as a gravel loading point before becoming used by the railway to dump waste such as old ballast and waste from Neasden power station. This route, never used for passenger traffic, continued to be used by London Transport&#x27;s small fleet of steam engines until 1971, when diesels replaced them. The branch closed some time after this, although a section of the spur line remained visible from a passing train.

A second short branch line, known as the Halton Railway, served RAF Halton near Wendover, across the Wendover Arm of the Grand Union Canal. The line was built during the First World War and closed in 1963. The trackbed is now a footpath.

Although not operated by Metropolitan passenger services, the line from South Harrow to Rayners Lane was built by the Metropolitan railway as the District Railway was in financial difficulties at the time. This included a short branch, part of which is still visible, on a viaduct to a gas works. Other minor freight connections along the line once included connections to the Midland main line at Finchley Road.

A single-track spur from a small yard between Ickenham and Ruislip stations connects to Ruislip Depot of the Central line. This line is used for engineering and empty stock transfers, although occasional plans suggest extending the Central line into Uxbridge by upgrading the connection. It was built in 1973.

== Metropolitan line extension ==
Also known as the Croxley Rail Link, an extension to the Metropolitan line was to reroute the Watford branch from the current terminus using the disused Croxley Green branch line to Watford Junction. Funding was agreed in December 2011 and the necessary permission was granted by the UK Government in July 2013. Due to a funding shortfall, the project was cancelled in 2016.

<text>Marc-Antoine Charpentier (; 1643 â 24 February 1704) was a French Baroque composer during the reign of Louis XIV. One of his most famous works is the main theme from the prelude of his &quot;Te Deum&quot; &quot;H.146, Marche en rondeau&quot;. This theme is still used today as a fanfare during television broadcasts of the Eurovision Network and the European Broadcasting Union.

Marc-Antoine Charpentier dominated the Baroque musical scene in seventeenth century France because of the quality of his prolific output. He mastered all genres, and his skill in writing sacred vocal music was especially hailed by his contemporaries.

He began his career by going to Italy, where he fell under the influence of Giacomo Carissimi as well as other Italian composers, perhaps Domenico Mazzocchi. He would remain marked by the Italian style and become the only one with Jean-Joseph CassanÃ©a de Mondonville in France to approach the oratorio. In 1670, he became a master of music (composer and singer) in the service of the Duchess of Guise. From 1690 Charpentier composed &quot;MÃ©dÃ©e&quot;, on a piece by Corneille. It was a determining failure in his career of composer: he henceforth devoted himself to religious music. He became the composer of the Carmelites of the &quot;Rue du Bouloir&quot;, Montmartre Abbey, Abbaye-aux-Bois and Port-Royal. In 1698, Charpentier was appointed music master for the children of the Sainte-Chapelle du Palais. After having obtained from the king Louis XIV a softening of Lully&#x27;s monopoly, MoliÃ¨re turned to Charpentier to compose the music for the intermissions of &quot;Circe&quot; and &quot;Andromeda&quot;, as well as sung scenes for the revivals of &quot;The Forced Marriage&quot;, and finally the musical pieces of &quot;The Imaginary invalid&quot;.

He composed secular works, stage music, operas, cantatas, sonatas, symphonies, as well as sacred music, motets (large or small), oratorios, masses, psalms, Magnificats, Litanies.

At the time of his death, Charpentier&#x27;s complete works must have numbered about 800 opus numbers, but today only 28 autograph volumes remain, or more than 500 pieces that he himself took care to classify. This collection, called &quot;MÃ©langes&quot;, is one of the most comprehensive sets of musical autograph manuscripts of all time.

==Biography==
Charpentier was born in or near Paris, the son of a master scribe who had very good connections to influential families in the Parlement of Paris. Marc-Antoine received a very good education, perhaps with the help of the Jesuits, and registered for law school in Paris when he was eighteen. He withdrew after one semester. He spent &quot;two or three years&quot; in Rome, probably between 1667 and 1669, and studied with Giacomo Carissimi. He is also known to have been in contact with poet-musician Charles Coypeau d&#x27;Assoucy, who was composing for the French Embassy in Rome. A legend claims that Charpentier initially traveled to Rome to study painting before he was discovered by Carissimi. This story is undocumented and possibly untrue; at any rate, although his 28 volumes of autograph manuscripts reveal considerable skill at tracing the arabesques used by professional scribes, they contain not a single drawing, not even a rudimentary sketch. Regardless, he acquired a solid knowledge of contemporary Italian musical practice and brought it back to France.

Immediately on his return to France, Charpentier probably began working as house composer to Marie de Lorraine, duchesse de Guise, who was known familiarly as &quot;Mlle de Guise.&quot; She gave him an &quot;apartment&quot; in the recently renovated HÃ´tel de Guise â strong evidence that Charpentier was not a paid domestic who slept in a small room in the vast residence, but was instead a courtier who occupied one of the new apartments in the stable wing.

For the next seventeen years, Charpentier composed a considerable quantity of vocal works for her, among them Psalm settings, hymns, motets, a Magnificat setting, a mass and a &quot;Dies Irae&quot; for the funeral of her nephew Louis Joseph, Duke of Guise, and a succession of Italianate oratorios set to non-liturgical Latin texts. (Charpentier preferred the Latin &quot;canticum&quot; to the Italian term, &quot;oratorio&quot;). Throughout the 1670s, the bulk of these works were for trios. The usual trio was two women and a singing bass, plus two treble instruments and continuo; but when performance in the chapel of a male monastic community required male voices, he would write for an haute-contre, a tenor and a bass, plus the same instruments. Then, about 1680, Mlle de Guise increased the size of the ensemble, until it included 13 performers and a singing teacher. In the pieces written from 1684 until late 1687, the names of the Guise musicians appear as marginalia in Charpentier&#x27;s manuscripts â including &quot;Charp&quot; beside the haute-contre line. Ãtienne LouliÃ©, the senior instrumentalist who played keyboard, recorder and viole, probably was entrusted with coaching the newer instrumentalists.

Despite what is often asserted, during his seventeen years in the service of Mlle de Guise, Charpentier was not the &quot;director&quot; of the Guise ensemble. The director was a gentleman of Mlle de Guise&#x27;s court, an amateur musician, Italophile, and Latinist named Philippe Goibaut, familiarly called &quot;Monsieur Du Bois.&quot; Owing to Mlle de Guise&#x27;s love for Italian music (a passion she shared with Du Bois), and her frequent entertaining of Italians passing through Paris, there was little reason for Charpentier to conceal the Italianisms he had learned in Rome.

During his years of service to Mlle de Guise, Charpentier also composed for &quot;Mme de Guise&quot;, Louis XIV&#x27;s first cousin. It was in large part owing to Mme de Guise&#x27;s protection that the Guise musicians were permitted to perform Charpentier&#x27;s chamber operas in defiance of the monopoly held by Jean Baptiste Lully. Most of the operas and &quot;pastorales&quot; in French, which date from 1684 to 1687, appear to have been commissioned by Mme de Guise for performance at court entertainments during the winter season; but Mlle de Guise doubtlessly included them in the entertainments she sponsored several times a week in her palatial Parisian residence.
By late 1687, Mlle de Guise was dying. Around that time, Charpentier entered the employ of the Jesuits. Indeed, he is not named in the princess&#x27;s will of March 1688, nor in the papers of her estate, which is strong evidence that she had already rewarded her loyal servant and approved of his departure.

During his seventeen-odd years at the HÃ´tel de Guise, Charpentier had written almost as many pages of music for outside commissions as he had for Mlle de Guise. (He routinely copied these outside commissions in notebooks with Roman numerals.) For example, after MoliÃ¨re&#x27;s falling out with Jean-Baptiste Lully in 1672, Charpentier had begun writing incidental music for the spoken theater of MoliÃ¨re. It probably was owing to pressure on MoliÃ¨re exerted by Mlle de Guise and by young Mme de Guise that the playwright took the commission for incidental music for &quot;Le Malade imaginaire&quot; away from Dassoucy and gave it to Charpentier. After MoliÃ¨re&#x27;s death in 1673, Charpentier continued to write for the playwright&#x27;s successors, Thomas Corneille and Jean Donneau de VisÃ©. Play after play, he would compose pieces that demanded more musicians than the number authorized by Lully&#x27;s monopoly over theatrical music. By 1685, the troop ceased flouting these restrictions. Their capitulation ended Charpentier&#x27;s career as a composer for the spoken theater.

In 1679, Charpentier had been singled out to compose for Louis XIV&#x27;s son, the Dauphin. Writing primarily for the prince&#x27;s private chapel, he composed devotional pieces for a small ensemble composed of royal musicians: the two PiÃ¨che sisters singing with a bass named Frizon, and instruments played by the two PiÃ¨che brothers. In short, an ensemble that, with Mlle de Guise&#x27;s permission, could perform works he had earlier composed for the Guises. By early 1683, when he was awarded a royal pension, Charpentier was being commissioned to write for court events such as the annual Corpus Christi procession. In April of that year, he became so ill that he had to withdraw from the competition for the sub-mastership of the royal chapel. Speculations that he withdrew because he knew he would not win seem disproved by his autograph notebooks: he wrote nothing at all from April through mid-August of that year, strong evidence that he was too ill to work.

From late 1687 to early 1698, Charpentier served as &quot;maÃ®tre de musique&quot; (music master) to the Jesuits, working first for their &quot;collÃ¨ge&quot; of Louis-le-Grand (for which he wrote &quot;Celse martyr&quot;, &quot;David et Jonathas&quot; and where he was still employed in April 1691) and then for the church of Saint-Louis adjacent to the order&#x27;s professed house on the rue Saint-Antoine. Once he moved to Saint-Louis, Charpentier virtually ceased writing oratorios and instead primarily wrote musical settings of psalms and other liturgical texts such as the Litanies of Loreto. During his years at Saint-Louis, his works tended to be for large ensembles that included paid singers from the Royal Opera. In addition, during these years Charpentier succeeded Ãtienne LouliÃ© as music teacher to Philippe, Duke of Chartres.

Charpentier was appointed &quot;maÃ®tre de musique&quot; for the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris in 1698, a royal post he held until his death in 1704. One of his most famous compositions during his tenure was the Mass &quot;Assumpta Est Maria&quot; (H.11). That this work survived suggests that it was written for another entity, an entity that was entitled to call upon the musicians of the Chapel and reward them for their efforts. Indeed, virtually none of Charpentier&#x27;s compositions from 1690 to 1704 have survived, because when the &quot;maÃ®tre de musique&quot; died, the royal administration routinely confiscated everything he had written for the Chapel. Charpentier died at Sainte-Chapelle, Paris, and was buried in the little walled-in cemetery just behind the choir of the chapel. (The cemetery no longer exists.)

In 1727, Charpentier&#x27;s heirs sold his autograph manuscripts (28 folio volumes) to the Royal Library, today the BibliothÃ¨que nationale de France. Commonly known as the &quot;MÃ©langes&quot;, or &quot;Meslanges&quot;, and now available as facsimiles published by Minkoff-France, these manuscripts were divided by Charpentier himself into two series of notebooks â one bearing Arabic numbers and the other Roman numbers, and each notebook numbered chronologically. These manuscripts (and their watermarks) have permitted scholars not only to date his compositions but also to determine the events for which many of these works were written.

==Music, style and influence==
His compositions include oratorios, masses, operas, leÃ§ons de tÃ©nÃ¨bres, motets and numerous smaller pieces that are difficult to categorize. Many of his smaller works for one or two voices and instruments resemble the Italian cantata of the time, and share most features except for the name: Charpentier calls them &quot;airs sÃ©rieux&quot; or &quot;airs Ã  boire&quot; if they are in French, but &quot;cantata&quot; if they are in Italian.

Not only did Charpentier compose during that &quot;transitory period&quot; so important to the &quot;evolution of musical language, where the modality of the ancients and the emerging tonal harmony coexisted and mutually enriched one another&quot; (Catherine Cessac, &quot;Marc-Antoine Charpentier&quot;, 2004 edition, p.Â 464), but he also was a respected theoretician. In the early 1680s he was analyzing the harmony in a polychoral mass by the Roman composer Francesco Beretta (BibliothÃ¨que nationale de France, Ms. RÃ©serve VM1 260, fol. 55â56). About 1691 he wrote a manual to be used for the musical training of Philippe d&#x27;OrlÃ©ans, duke of Chartres; and about 1693 he expanded this manual. The two versions survive as copies in the hand of Ãtienne LouliÃ©, Charpentier&#x27;s colleague, who called them &quot;RÃ¨gles de Composition par Monsieur Charpentier&quot; and &quot;Augmentations tirÃ©es de l&#x27;original de Mr le duc de Chartres&quot; (BibliothÃ¨que nationale de France, ms. n.a. fr. 6355, fols. 1â16). On a blank page of the &quot;Augmentations&quot;, LouliÃ© in addition listed some of the points that Charpentier made in a treatise that LouliÃ© called &quot;RÃ¨gles de l&#x27;accompagnement de Mr Charpentier&quot;. Three theoretical works long known to scholars exist, but did not reveal much about Charpentier&#x27;s evolution as a theoretician. Then, in November 2009, a fourth treatise, this time in Charpentier&#x27;s own hand, was identified in the collection of the Lilly Library at Indiana University, Bloomington, U.S.A. Written during the final months of 1698 and numbered &quot;XLI,&quot; this treatise appears to have been the forty-first in a series hitherto not imagined by Charpentier scholars, a series of theoretical treatises that spans almost two decades, from the early 1680s to 1698.

==Modern significance==
The prelude to his Te Deum, H.146, a rondo, is the signature tune for the European Broadcasting Union, heard in the opening credits of Eurovision events. This theme was also the introductory music to &quot;The Olympiad&quot; films of Bud Greenspan.

== Charpentier&#x27;s works ==

<doc id="82233" wikidata="Q1429157" url="?curid=82233" title="Battle of Deorham">
<text>The Battle of Deorham (or Dyrham) is portrayed by the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; as an important military encounter between the West Saxons and the Britons in the West Country in 577. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; depicts the battle as a major victory for Wessex&#x27;s forces, led by Ceawlin and one Cuthwine, resulting in the capture of the Romano-British towns of (Gloucester), (Cirencester), and (Bath).

==Evidence==

The only evidence for the battle is an entry in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, in the so-called &#x27;common stock&#x27; of annals on which all manuscripts of the &quot;Chronicle&quot; build that was edited into its current form in the later ninth century. As given in the earliest manuscript, the Parker Chronicle, the annal reads:

Scholars agree that the place-name &quot;Deorham&quot; here survives in the name of Dyrham in what is now South Gloucestershire, on the Cotswolds escarpment a few miles north of Bath, and that it is here that the battle is portrayed as taking place. The identification of the other cities is even less controversial; they correspond to , a provincial capital in the Roman period (Cirencester); , a former &quot;colonia&quot; (Gloucester); and , a renowned spa and pagan religious centre (Bath).

==Historiography==
===Nineteenth-century narrative of Anglo-Saxon settlement===
In an influential lecture of 1849 on &quot;The Early English Settlements in South Britain&quot;, Edwin Guest argued that the battle was (in the words of one of his audience) the culmination ofthe long story of the gradual encroachments of the conquerors on the native tribes retiring step by step, only yielding up their territory after bloody defeats, the battles of Charford, and Badbury, and Barbury and Old Sarum, within a mile or two of the place of our meeting, until the decisive battle of Deorham sealed the fate of southern Britain, and the Weals [Britons], severed from one another by the broad expanse of the Severn Sea, were finally cooped up among the mountain ridges of Wales, or in the peninsula of Cornwall.Guest&#x27;s conception of the reality of the battle and its place in a coherent narrative of Anglo-Saxon military conquest and settlement of southern Britain remained prominent among historians into the 1980s, partly on the basis of the natural strategic importance of the Severn Valley in British geography. These historians include Frank Stenton, John Morris, H. P. R. Finberg, and J. N. L. Myres.

====Twentieth-century military-history speculation====
The belief that the &quot;Chronicle&quot; account was substantially reliableânotwithstanding its obvious brevityâencouraged elaborate speculation by antiquarians such as Welbore St Clair Baddeley. In 1929 he supposed that the Saxons launched a surprise attack and seized the hill fort at the Hinton Hill Camp (near Dyrham) because it commanded the Avon Valley, and disrupted communications north and south between Bath and the neighbouring Romano-British towns of Gloucester and Cirencester. Once the Saxons were in occupation of the site (and, he supposed, had begun reinforcing the existing Iron Age defensive structures at the site) the Britons of those three towns were compelled to unite and make a combined attempt to dislodge them. Their attempt failed and the three opposing British kings were killed. Their routed forces were driven north of the River Severn and south of Bath where it appears they began the construction of the defensive earthwork called the &quot;Wansdyke&quot; in a doomed attempt to prevent more territory from being lost.

The military historian Lieutenant-Colonel Alfred Burne, employing his theory of &quot;inherent military probability&quot;, opted for a simpler explanation for the battle than Baddeley. In his view, Ceawlin was methodically advancing towards the Severn and the three forces of Britons concentrated to stop him. Burne suggests that they formed up along two slight ridges across the trackway that skirted the Forest of Braden, with Hinton Hill Camp behind them as their stores depot. Burne speculated that if the Saxon attack drove the Britons back from their first line onto the second ridge near the edge of the escarpment, the slightest further retreat would leave their flanks open to a downhill pursuit. He imagined that this is what occurred, with the three Briton leaders and their main body being driven back into the fort while the flanking Saxons driving forwards swept round behind the promontory on which the fort stands. A last stand in this position would explain why none of the three Briton leaders was able to escape. Burne went so far as to speculate that the battle was the starting point for Welsh and Cornish becoming two separate languages.

===Re-evaluation===
By the early 1980s, a new wave of source-criticism was underway regarding the fifth-to-seventh centuries in Britain, and the Battle of Deorham was prominently tackled by Patrick Sims-Williams. He noted that the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; shows no signs of being a contemporary record for the sixth century and many signs of being a later fabrication based on oral tradition and folk-etymologies of place-names, and that its material for the sixth century may reflect later West-Saxon attempts to legitimise their politics in the seventh, eighth, and/or ninth centuries by circulating stories of an imaginary past. Showing how the &quot;Chronicle&quot;&#x27;s 571 Battle of Bedcanford would have functioned to provide a West-Saxon right of conquest to much of the Chiltern Hills and the vale to their north-west following Mercia&#x27;s conquest of that area in the eighth century, he noted that the Battle of Deorham too might have been used by West Saxons to counter Mercian claims in the Severn Valley. But he thought more likely the possibility that the annal was based on a Welsh triad, itself unlikely to be historically accurate, arising from a similar tradition to medieval Welsh literature which places an English-battling seventh-century king called Cynddylan in the Wroxeter region.

Scholars also argued that the importance given the towns more likely reflects ninth and tenth-century polities, of the time the &quot;Chronicle&quot; was given its present form, than the de-urbanised sixth century.

<text>The field of articulatory phonetics is a subfield of phonetics that studies articulation and ways that humans produce speech. Articulatory phoneticians explain how humans produce speech sounds via the interaction of different physiological structures. Generally, articulatory phonetics is concerned with the transformation of aerodynamic energy into acoustic energy. Aerodynamic energy refers to the airflow through the vocal tract. Its potential form is air pressure; its kinetic form is the actual dynamic airflow. Acoustic energy is variation in the air pressure that can be represented as sound waves, which are then perceived by the human auditory system as sound.

Respiratory sounds can be produced by expelling air from the lungs. However, to vary the sound quality in a way useful for speaking, two speech organs normally move towards each other to contact each other to create an obstruction that shapes the air in a particular fashion. The point of maximum obstruction is called the &quot;place of articulation&quot;, and the way the obstruction forms and releases is the &quot;manner of articulation&quot;. For example, when making a &quot;p&quot; sound, the lips come together tightly, blocking the air momentarily and causing a buildup of air pressure. The lips then release suddenly, causing a burst of sound. The place of articulation of this sound is therefore called &#x27;, and the manner is called&#x27; (also known as a &quot;plosive&quot;).

==Components==

The vocal tract can be viewed through an aerodynamic-biomechanic model that includes three main components:

# air cavities
# pistons
# air valves

Air cavities are containers of air molecules of specific volumes and masses. The main air cavities present in the articulatory system are the supraglottal cavity and the subglottal cavity. They are so-named because the glottis, the openable space between the vocal folds internal to the larynx, separates the two cavities. The supraglottal cavity or the orinasal cavity is divided into an oral subcavity (the cavity from the glottis to the lips excluding the nasal cavity) and a nasal subcavity (the cavity from the velopharyngeal port, which can be closed by raising the velum). The subglottal cavity consists of the trachea and the lungs. The atmosphere external to the articulatory stem may also be considered an air cavity whose potential connecting points with respect to the body are the nostrils and the lips.

Pistons are initiators. The term &quot;initiator&quot; refers to the fact that they are used to initiate a change in the volumes of air cavities, and, by Boyle&#x27;s law, the corresponding air pressure of the cavity. The term &quot;initiation&quot; refers to the change. Since changes in air pressures between connected cavities lead to airflow between the cavities, initiation is also referred to as an &quot;airstream mechanism&quot;. The three pistons present in the articulatory system are the larynx, the tongue body, and the physiological structures used to manipulate lung volume (in particular, the floor and the walls of the chest). The lung pistons are used to initiate a pulmonic airstream (found in all human languages). The larynx is used to initiate the glottalic airstream mechanism by changing the volume of the supraglottal and subglottal cavities via vertical movement of the larynx (with a closed glottis). Ejectives and implosives are made with this airstream mechanism. The tongue body creates a velaric airstream by changing the pressure within the oral cavity: the tongue body changes the mouth subcavity. Click consonants use the velaric airstream mechanism. Pistons are controlled by various muscles.

Valves regulate airflow between cavities. Airflow occurs when an air valve is open and there is a pressure difference between the connecting cavities. When an air valve is closed, there is no airflow. The air valves are the vocal folds (the glottis), which regulate between the supraglottal and subglottal cavities, the velopharyngeal port, which regulates between the oral and nasal cavities, the tongue, which regulates between the oral cavity and the atmosphere, and the lips, which also regulate between the oral cavity and the atmosphere. Like the pistons, the air valves are also controlled by various muscles.

== Initiation ==
To produce any kind of sound, there must be movement of air. To produce sounds that people can interpret as spoken words, the movement of air must pass through the vocal folds, up through the throat and, into the mouth or nose to then leave the body. Different sounds are formed by different positions of the mouthâor, as linguists call it, &quot;the oral cavity&quot; (to distinguish it from the nasal cavity).

==Consonants==

Consonants are speech sounds that are articulated with a complete or partial closure of the vocal tract. They are generally produced by the modification of an airstream exhaled from the lungs. The respiratory organs used to create and modify airflow are divided into three regions: the vocal tract (supralaryngeal), the larynx, and the subglottal system. The airstream can be either egressive (out of the vocal tract) or ingressive (into the vocal tract). In pulmonic sounds, the airstream is produced by the lungs in the subglottal system and passes through the larynx and vocal tract. Glottalic sounds use an airstream created by movements of the larynx without airflow from the lungs. Click consonants are articulated through the rarefaction of air using the tongue, followed by releasing the forward closure of the tongue.

===Place of articulation===
Consonants are pronounced in the vocal tract, usually in the mouth. In order to describe the place of articulation, the active and passive articulator need to be known. In most cases, the active articulators are the lips and tongue. The passive articulator is the surface on which the constriction is created. Constrictions made by the lips are called labials. Constrictions can be made in several parts of the vocal tract, broadly classified into coronal, dorsal and radical places of articulation. Coronal articulations are made with the front of the tongue, dorsal articulations are made with the back of the tongue, and radical articulations are made in the pharynx. These divisions are not sufficient for distinguishing and describing all speech sounds. For example, in English the sounds and are both coronal, but they are produced in different places of the mouth. To account for this, more detailed places of articulation are needed based upon the area of the mouth in which the constriction occurs.

====Labial consonants====

Articulations involving the lips can be made in three different ways: with both lips (bilabial), with one lip and the teeth (labiodental), and with the tongue and the upper lip (linguolabial). Depending on the definition used, some or all of these kinds of articulations may be categorized into the class of labial articulations. Ladefoged and Maddieson (1996) propose that linguolabial articulations be considered coronals rather than labials, but make clear this grouping, like all groupings of articulations, is equivocal and not cleanly divided. Linguolabials are included in this section as labials given their use of the lips as a place of articulation.

Bilabial consonants are made with both lips. In producing these sounds the lower lip moves farthest to meet the upper lip, which also moves down slightly, though in some cases the force from air moving through the aperture (opening between the lips) may cause the lips to separate faster than they can come together. Unlike most other articulations, both articulators are made from soft tissue, and so bilabial stops are more likely to be produced with incomplete closures than articulations involving hard surfaces like the teeth or palate. Bilabial stops are also unusual in that an articulator in the upper section of the vocal tract actively moves downwards, as the upper lip shows some active downward movement.

Labiodental consonants are made by the lower lip rising to the upper teeth. Labiodental consonants are most often fricatives while labiodental nasals are also typologically common. There is debate as to whether true labiodental plosives occur in any natural language, though a number of languages are reported to have labiodental plosives including Zulu, Tonga, and Shubi. Labiodental affricates are reported in Tsonga which would require the stop portion of the affricate to be a labiodental stop, though Ladefoged and Maddieson (1996) raise the possibility that labiodental affricates involve a bilabial closure like &quot;pf&quot; in German. Unlike plosives and affricates, labiodental nasals are common across languages.

Linguolabial consonants are made with the blade of the tongue approaching or contacting the upper lip. Like in bilabial articulations, the upper lip moves slightly towards the more active articulator. Articulations in this group do not have their own symbols in the International Phonetic Alphabet, rather, they are formed by combining an apical symbol with a diacritic implicitly placing them in the coronal category. They exist in a number of languages indigenous to Vanuatu such as Tangoa, though early descriptions referred to them as apical-labial consonants. The name &quot;linguolabial&quot; was suggested by Floyd Lounsbury given that they are produced with the blade rather than the tip of the tongue.

====Coronal consonants====

Coronal consonants are made with the tip or blade of the tongue and, because of the agility of the front of the tongue, represent a variety not only in place but in the posture of the tongue. The coronal places of articulation represent the areas of the mouth where the tongue contacts or makes a constriction, and include dental, alveolar, and post-alveolar locations. Tongue postures using the tip of the tongue can be apical if using the top of the tongue tip, laminal if made with the blade of the tongue, or sub-apical if the tongue tip is curled back and the bottom of the tongue is used. Coronals are unique as a group in that every manner of articulation is attested. Australian languages are well known for the large number of coronal contrasts exhibited within and across languages in the region.

Dental consonants are made with the tip or blade of the tongue and the upper teeth. They are divided into two groups based upon the part of the tongue used to produce them: apical dental consonants are produced with the tongue tip touching the teeth; interdental consonants are produced with the blade of the tongue as the tip of the tongue sticks out in front of the teeth. No language is known to use both contrastively though they may exist allophonically.

Alveolar consonants are made with the tip or blade of the tongue at the alveolar ridge just behind the teeth and can similarly be apical or laminal.

Crosslinguistically, dental consonants and alveolar consonants are frequently contrasted leading to a number of generalizations of crosslinguistic patterns. The different places of articulation tend to also be contrasted in the part of the tongue used to produce them: most languages with dental stops have laminal dentals, while languages with alveolar stops usually have apical stops. Languages rarely have two consonants in the same place with a contrast in laminality, though Taa (ÇXÃ³Ãµ) is a counterexample to this pattern. If a language has only one of a dental stop or an alveolar stop, it will usually be laminal if it is a dental stop, and the stop will usually be apical if it is an alveolar stop, though for example Temne and Bulgarian do not follow this pattern. If a language has both an apical and laminal stop, then the laminal stop is more likely to be affricated like in Isoko, though Dahalo show the opposite pattern with alveolar stops being more affricated.

Retroflex consonants have several different definitions depending on whether the position of the tongue or the position on the roof of the mouth is given prominence. In general, they represent a group of articulations in which the tip of the tongue is curled upwards to some degree. In this way, retroflex articulations can occur in several different locations on the roof of the mouth including alveolar, post-alveolar, and palatal regions. If the underside of the tongue tip makes contact with the roof of the mouth, it is sub-apical though apical post-alveolar sounds are also described as retroflex. Typical examples of sub-apical retroflex stops are commonly found in Dravidian languages, and in some languages indigenous to the southwest United States the contrastive difference between dental and alveolar stops is a slight retroflexion of the alveolar stop. Acoustically, retroflexion tends to affect the higher formants.

Articulations taking place just behind the alveolar ridge, known as post-alveolar consonants, have been referred to using a number of different terms. Apical post-alveolar consonants are often called retroflex, while laminal articulations are sometimes called palato-alveolar; in the Australianist literature, these laminal stops are often described as &#x27;palatal&#x27; though they are produced further forward than the palate region typically described as palatal. Because of individual anatomical variation, the precise articulation of palato-alveolar stops (and coronals in general) can vary widely within a speech community.

====Dorsal consonants====

Dorsal consonants are those consonants made using the tongue body rather than the tip or blade.

Palatal consonants are made using the tongue body against the hard palate on the roof of the mouth. They are frequently contrasted with velar or uvular consonants, though it is rare for a language to contrast all three simultaneously, with Jaqaru as a possible example of a three-way contrast.

Velar consonants are made using the tongue body against the velum. They are incredibly common cross-linguistically; almost all languages have a velar stop. Because both velars and vowels are made using the tongue body, they are highly affected by coarticulation with vowels and can be produced as far forward as the hard palate or as far back as the uvula. These variations are typically divided into front, central, and back velars in parallel with the vowel space. They can be hard to distinguish phonetically from palatal consonants, though are produced slightly behind the area of prototypical palatal consonants.

Uvular consonants are made by the tongue body contacting or approaching the uvula. They are rare, occurring in an estimated 19 percent of languages, and large regions of the Americas and Africa have no languages with uvular consonants. In languages with uvular consonants, stops are most frequent followed by continuants (including nasals).

==== Radical consonants ====

Radical consonants either use the root of the tongue or the epiglottis during production.

Pharyngeal consonants are made by retracting the root of the tongue far enough to touch the wall of the pharynx. Due to production difficulties, only fricatives and approximants can be produced this way.

Epiglottal consonants are made with the epiglottis and the back wall of the pharynx. Epiglottal stops have been recorded in Dahalo. Voiced epiglottal consonants are not deemed possible due to the cavity between the glottis and epiglottis being too small to permit voicing.

==== Glottal consonants ====

Glottal consonants are those produced using the vocal folds in the larynx. Because the vocal folds are the source of phonation and below the oro-nasal vocal tract, a number of glottal consonants are impossible such as a voiced glottal stop. Three glottal consonants are possible, a voiceless glottal stop and two glottal fricatives, and all are attested in natural languages.

Glottal stops, produced by closing the vocal folds, are notably common in the world&#x27;s languages. While many languages use them to demarcate phrase boundaries, some languages like Huatla Mazatec have them as contrastive phonemes. Additionally, glottal stops can be realized as laryngealization of the following vowel in this language. Glottal stops, especially between vowels, do usually not form a complete closure. True glottal stops normally occur only when they are geminated.

=== Manner of articulation ===

Knowing the place of articulation is not enough to fully describe a consonant, the way in which the stricture happens is equally important. Manners of articulation describe how exactly the active articulator modifies, narrows or closes off the vocal tract.

Stops (also referred to as plosives) are consonants where the airstream is completely obstructed. Pressure builds up in the mouth during the stricture, which is then released as a small burst of sound when the articulators move apart. The velum is raised so that air cannot flow through the nasal cavity. If the velum is lowered and allows for air to flow through the nose, the result in a nasal stop. However, phoneticians almost always refer to nasal stops as just &quot;nasals&quot;.Affricates are a sequence of stops followed by a fricative in the same place.

Fricatives are consonants where the airstream is made turbulent by partially, but not completely, obstructing part of the vocal tract. Sibilants are a special type of fricative where the turbulent airstream is directed towards the teeth, creating a high-pitched hissing sound.

Nasals (sometimes referred to as nasal stops) are consonants in which there&#x27;s a closure in the oral cavity and the velum is lowered, allowing air to flow through the nose.

In an approximant, the articulators come close together, but not to such an extent that allows a turbulent airstream.

Laterals are consonants in which the airstream is obstructed along the center of the vocal tract, allowing the airstream to flow freely on one or both sides. Laterals have also been defined as consonants in which the tongue is contracted in such a way that the airstream is greater around the sides than over the center of the tongue. The first definition does not allow for air to flow over the tongue.

Trills are consonants in which the tongue or lips are set in motion by the airstream. The stricture is formed in such a way that the airstream causes a repeating pattern of opening and closing of the soft articulator(s). Apical trills typically consist of two or three periods of vibration.

Taps and flaps are single, rapid, usually apical gestures where the tongue is thrown against the roof of the mouth, comparable to a very rapid stop. These terms are sometimes used interchangeably, but some phoneticians make a distinction. In a tap, the tongue contacts the roof in a single motion whereas in a flap the tongue moves tangentially to the roof of the mouth, striking it in passing.

During a glottalic airstream mechanism, the glottis is closed, trapping a body of air. This allows for the remaining air in the vocal tract to be moved separately. An upward movement of the closed glottis will move this air out, resulting in it an ejective consonant. Alternatively, the glottis can lower, sucking more air into the mouth, which results in an implosive consonant.

Clicks are stops in which tongue movement causes air to be sucked in the mouth, this is referred to as a velaric airstream. During the click, the air becomes rarefied between two articulatory closures, producing a loud &#x27;click&#x27; sound when the anterior closure is released. The release of the anterior closure is referred to as the click influx. The release of the posterior closure, which can be velar or uvular, is the click efflux. Clicks are used in several African language families, such as the Khoisan and Bantu languages.

==Vowels==
Vowels are produced by the passage of air through the larynx and the vocal tract. Most vowels are voiced (i.e. the vocal folds are vibrating). Except in some marginal cases, the vocal tract is open, so that the airstream is able to escape without generating fricative noise.

Variation in vowel quality is produced by means of the following articulatory structures:

===Articulators===
====Glottis====
The glottis is the opening between the vocal folds located in the larynx. Its position creates different vibration patterns to distinguish voiced and voiceless sounds. In addition, the pitch of the vowel is changed by altering the frequency of vibration of the vocal folds. In some languages there are contrasts among vowels with different phonation types.

====Pharynx====
The pharynx is the region of the vocal tract below the velum and above the larynx. Vowels may be made pharyngealized (also &quot;epiglottalized&quot;, &quot;sphincteric&quot; or &quot;strident&quot;) by means of a retraction of the tongue root. Vowels may also be articulated with advanced tongue root. There is discussion of whether this vowel feature (ATR) is different from the Tense/Lax distinction in vowels.

====Velum====
The velumâor soft palateâcontrols airflow through the nasal cavity. Nasals and nasalized sounds are produced by lowering the velum and allowing air to escape through the nose. Vowels are normally produced with the soft palate raised so that no air escapes through the nose. However, vowels may be nasalized as a result of lowering the soft palate. Many languages use nasalization contrastively.

====Tongue====
The tongue is a highly flexible organ that is capable of being moved in many different ways. For vowel articulation the principal variations are vowel height and the dimension of backness and frontness. A less common variation in vowel quality can be produced by a change in the shape of the front of the tongue, resulting in a rhotic or rhotacized vowel.

====Lips====
The lips play a major role in vowel articulation. It is generally believed that two major variables are in effect: lip-rounding (or labialization) and lip protrusion.

==Airflow==

For all practical purposes, temperature can be treated as constant in the articulatory system. Thus, Boyle&#x27;s law can usefully be written
as the following two equations.

: formula_1

: formula_2

What the above equations express is that given an initial pressure &quot;P&quot;1 and volume &quot;V&quot;1 at time 1 the product of these two values will be equal to the product of the pressure &quot;P&quot;2 and volume &quot;V&quot;2 at a later time 2. This means that if there is an increase in the volume of cavity, there will be a corresponding decrease in pressure of that same cavity, and vice versa. In other words, volume and pressure are inversely proportional (or negatively correlated) to each other. As applied to a description of the subglottal cavity, when the lung pistons contract the lungs, the volume of the subglottal cavity decreases while the subglottal air pressure increases. Conversely, if the lungs are expanded, the pressure decreases.

A situation can be considered where (1) the vocal fold valve is closed separating the supraglottal cavity from the subglottal cavity, (2) the mouth is open and, therefore, supraglottal air pressure is equal to atmospheric pressure, and (3) the lungs are contracted resulting in a subglottal pressure that has increased to a pressure that is greater than atmospheric pressure. If the vocal fold valve is subsequently opened, the previously two separate cavities become one unified cavity although the cavities will still be aerodynamically isolated because the glottic valve between them is relatively small and constrictive. Pascal&#x27;s Law states that the pressure within a system must be equal throughout the system. When the subglottal pressure is greater than supraglottal pressure, there is a pressure inequality in the unified cavity. Since pressure is a force applied to a surface area by definition and a force is the product of mass and acceleration according to Newton&#x27;s Second Law of Motion, the pressure inequality will be resolved by having part of the mass in air molecules found in the subglottal cavity move to the supraglottal cavity. This movement of mass is airflow. The airflow will continue until a pressure equilibrium is reached. Similarly, in an ejective consonant with a glottalic airstream mechanism, the lips or the tongue (i.e., the buccal or lingual valve) are initially closed and the closed glottis (the laryngeal piston) is raised decreasing the oral cavity volume behind the valve closure and increasing the pressure compared to the volume and pressure at a resting state. When the closed valve is opened, airflow will result from the cavity behind the initial closure outward until intraoral pressure is equal to atmospheric pressure. That is, air will flow from a cavity of higher pressure to a cavity of lower pressure until the equilibrium point; the pressure as potential energy is, thus, converted into airflow as kinetic energy.

==Sound sources==

Sound sources refer to the conversion of aerodynamic energy into acoustic energy. There are two main types of sound sources in the articulatory system: periodic (or more precisely semi-periodic) and aperiodic. A periodic sound source is vocal fold vibration produced at the glottis found in vowels and voiced consonants. A less common periodic sound source is the vibration of an oral articulator like the tongue found in alveolar trills. Aperiodic sound sources are the turbulent noise of fricative consonants and the short-noise burst of plosive releases produced in the oral cavity.

Voicing is a common period sound source in spoken language and is related to how closely the vocal cords are placed together. In English there are only two possibilities, &quot;voiced&quot; and &quot;unvoiced&quot;. Voicing is caused by the vocal cords held close by each other, so that air passing through them makes them vibrate. All normally spoken vowels are voiced, as are all other sonorants except &quot;h&quot;, as well as some of the remaining sounds (&quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, &quot;z&quot;, &quot;zh&quot;, &quot;j&quot;, and the &quot;th&quot; sound in &quot;this&quot;). All the rest are voiceless sounds, with the vocal cords held far enough apart that there is no vibration; however, there is still a certain amount of audible friction, as in the sound &quot;h&quot;. Voiceless sounds are not very prominent unless there is some turbulence, as in the stops, fricatives, and affricates; this is why sonorants in general only occur voiced. The exception is during whispering, when all sounds pronounced are voiceless.

===Palatography===

In order to understand how sounds are made, experimental procedures are often adopted. Palatography is one of the oldest instrumental phonetic techniques used to record data regarding articulators. In traditional, static palatography, a speaker&#x27;s palate is coated with a dark powder. The speaker then produces a word, usually with a single consonant. The tongue wipes away some of the powder at the place of articulation. The experimenter can then use a mirror to photograph the entire upper surface of the speaker&#x27;s mouth. This photograph, in which the place of articulation can be seen as the area where the powder has been removed, is called a palatogram.

Technology has since made possible electropalatography (or EPG). In order to collect EPG data, the speaker is fitted with a special prosthetic palate, which contains a number of electrodes. The way in which the electrodes are &quot;contacted&quot; by the tongue during speech provides phoneticians with important information, such as how much of the palate is contacted in different speech sounds, or which regions of the palate are contacted, or what the duration of the contact is.

<text>The Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) is an international organization established to facilitate the voices of unrepresented and marginalized nations and peoples worldwide. It was formed on 11 February 1991 at the Peace Palace in The Hague, Netherlands. Its members consist of indigenous peoples, minorities, and unrecognized or occupied territories.

UNPO works to develop the understanding of and respect for the right to self-determination, provides advice and support related to questions of international recognition and political autonomy, trains groups on how to advocate for their causes effectively, and directly advocates for an international response to human rights violations perpetrated against UNPO member groups.
Since its foundation in 1991, UNPOâs membership has grown steadily from its original founders, now representing more than 45 peoples worldwide, comprising over 300 million people lacking true representation in domestic or international forums. Over the years, many members have achieved their movementâs goals and gained formal recognition at the national or international level, leading them to leave the organization as their peoples are no longer considered âunrepresented.â Former members who have left the organization after gaining full independence and joining the United Nations (UN) include Armenia, East Timor, Estonia, Latvia, Georgia and Palau.

Throughout 2024, UNPO conducted several training sessions aimed at helping its members and activists. Sessions included in-person training for Asia Pacific members in Geneva, online cybersecurity training, a cybersecurity training in person for the Baloch community in Stockholm, an in-person training in Brussels on the principles and practical applications of non-violent resistance and a youth study session supported by the Council of Europe, emphasizing the importance of acquiring and improving necessary skills for advocacy within marginalized communities. 

== History ==
The UNPO was conceived of by leaders of self-determination movements such as Linnart MÃ¤ll of the Congress of Estonia, Erkin Alptekin of East Turkestan, and Lodi Gyari of Tibet, together with , along with the international law adviser of the 14th Dalai Lama. The founders were representatives of national movements of Estonia, Latvia, Tibet, Crimean Tatars, Armenia, Georgia, Tatarstan, East Turkestan, East Timor, Australian Aboriginals, the Cordillera in the Philippines, the Greek minority in Albania, Kurdistan, Palau, Taiwan, and West Papua. A key UNPO goal was, and remains, to replicate the powerful message of nonviolence and interethnic tolerance in the face of oppression exhibited by the Tibetan people and championed by the 14th Dalai Lama and to provide a forum in which others are encouraged and supported to adopt similar approaches.

UNPO chose for its founding headquarters in 1991 The Hague in the Netherlands because the city aimed at becoming the International City of Peace and Justice and hosts international courts like the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and International Criminal Court (ICC). A Foundation was established in the Netherlands to provide secretarial support to the UNPO General Assembly and to carry out research and educational activities related to unrepresented peoples worldwide. The Foundation maintains a permanent presence before the European Union, United States and United Nations. It is funded by a combination of member contributions, donations from individuals, and project-based grants from foundations.

== Aims ==
UNPOâs aim is to uphold the fundamental right to autonomy and self-determination for all peoples, striving for a world where every nation and people is heard, valued, and respected. It envisions a future where fundamental rights, including the freedom to determine political status and pursue economic, social, and cultural development, are guaranteed for all.

To achieve this, UNPO fosters solidarity and knowledge exchange among unrepresented peoples through a unique global platform. By strengthening cross-regional projects and engaging in dialogue with the international community, UNPO contributes to building a peaceful, democratic, equitable, and sustainable world. The platform ensures that the voices of unrepresented peoples are not only heard but valued in global forums, empowering nations and peoples to fully realize their potential within a just and inclusive society.

UNPOâs work emphasizes the necessity of non-violent resistance against oppression, while also focusing on the inclusion of underrepresented groups, particularly youth and women, in decision-making processes. By strengthening democratic values, spreading the principles of Gandhian non-violence, and advocating for human rights, the organization empowers members to preserve their cultural identities and contribute to global discussions on pressing environmental and geopolitical challenges. Through strategic partnerships with like-minded organizations, academia, and international actors, UNPO raises awareness of human rights abuses and supports members in having their voices heard on the world stage.

Although UNPO members often have different goals, they have one thing in common: they are generally not represented diplomatically (or only with a minor status, such as observer) in major international institutions, such as the United Nations (UN). As a result, their ability to have their concerns addressed by the global bodies mandated to protect human rights and address conflict is limited.

UNPO is dedicated to the five principles enshrined in its Covenant:

1) The equal right to self-determination:
Self-determination is a fundamental human right, allowing peoples to shape their own political, cultural, and social future, ensuring that all voices are heard in decision-making processes.

2) Adherence to the internationally accepted human rights standards as laid down in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and other international instruments:
Human rights are universal norms designed to protect all people from political, legal, and social abuses, regardless of ethnicity, nationality, or legal status.

3) Adherence to the principles of democratic pluralism and rejection of totalitarianism and religious intolerance:
Democratic pluralism is an inclusive, participatory system where governance is accountable, transparent, and responsive to the people. It embraces diversity, celebrates different cultures, and promotes political inclusion through knowledge, freedom of thought, and openness to differing viewpoints.

4) Promotion of non-violence and the rejection of terrorism as an instrument of policy:
Non-violence is the rejection of violent actions to achieve political goals. UNPO encourages members to adopt peaceful resistance and promote inter-ethnic tolerance in response to oppression.

5) Protection of the natural environment:
Environmental protection is about preserving habitats and resources that protect cultures. Indigenous and local communities, as guardians of traditional ecological knowledge, are best positioned to safeguard their environment and way of life.

All members are required to sign and abide by the UNPO Covenant. UNPO members are required to be nonviolent.

<text>Pioneer P-3 (also known as Atlas-Able 4 or Pioneer X) was intended to be a lunar orbiter probe, but the mission failed shortly after launch. The objectives were to place a highly instrumented probe in lunar orbit, to investigate the environment between the Earth and Moon, and to develop technology for controlling and maneuvering spacecraft from Earth. It was equipped to take images of the lunar surface with a television-like system, estimate the Moon&#x27;s mass and topography of the poles, record the distribution and velocity of micrometeorites, and study radiation, magnetic fields, and low frequency electromagnetic waves in space. A mid-course propulsion system and injection rocket would have been the first United States self-contained propulsion system capable of operation many months after launch at great distances from Earth and the first U.S. tests of maneuvering a satellite in space.

== Mission ==
The probe was originally intended for launch on Atlas 9C in October, but the launch vehicle was destroyed in a static firing accident on 24 September, so it was decided to use the Atlas D (an operational version of the Atlas ICBM) rather than the Atlas C, which was still a test model. The launch took place on Thanksgiving, 26 November 1959 from LC-14 at Cape Canaveral Air Station using Atlas vehicle 20D, which had originally been the backup booster for the Mercury Big Joe test in September. Since that flight was successful, Atlas 20D was reused for the Able program, coupled to Thor-Able upper stages including an Able x 248 rocket third stage. Because 20D had been custom-built for the Mercury program, it had thicker-gauge skin than the standard Atlas ICBM and could support the additional weight of upper stages. All proceeded normally until T+45 seconds when a shock was recorded by the Atlas&#x27;s rate gyros followed by the fiberglass payload fairing breaking off of the launch vehicle. The third stage and payload were stripped away after being subjected to severe aerodynamic loads while passing Max Q and the second stage sustained damage followed by loss of its telemetry at T+104 seconds. The Atlas itself was unaffected by the incident and completed its burn on schedule, impacting in the Gulf of Guinea. The failure was traced to an improperly vented payload shroud that broke apart when the air pressure inside started exceeding the external pressure as the atmosphere thinned with altitude. In addition to changing prelaunch procedures, the shroud was redesigned to be more aerodynamic on future flights.

== Spacecraft design ==

Pioneer P-3 was a 1-meter diameter sphere with a monopropellant propulsion system mounted on the bottom giving a total length of 1.4 meters. The mass of the structure and aluminum alloy shell was 25.3Â kg and the propulsion units 88.4Â kg. Four solar panels, each 60 x 60Â cm and containing 2200 solar cells in 22 100-cell nodules, extended from the sides of the spherical shell in a &quot;paddle-wheel&quot; configuration with a total span of about 2.7 meters. The solar panels charged chemical batteries. Inside the shell, a large spherical hydrazine tank made up most of the volume, topped by two smaller spherical nitrogen tanks and a 90 N injection rocket to slow the spacecraft down to go into lunar orbit, which was designed to be capable of firing twice during the mission. Attached to the bottom of the sphere was a 90 N vernier rocket for mid-course propulsion and lunar orbit maneuvers which could be fired four times. This space engine was designed and built under contract with NASA by the Space Technology Laboratories (STL) of TRW.

Around the upper hemisphere of the hydrazine tank was a ring-shaped instrument platform which held the batteries in two packs, two 5 W UHF transmitters and diplexers, logic modules for scientific instruments, two command receivers, decoders, a buffer/amplifier, three converters, a telebit, a command box, and most of the scientific instruments. Two dipole UHF antennas protruded from the top of the sphere on either side of the injection rocket nozzle. Two dipole UHF antennas and a long VLF antenna protruded from the bottom of the sphere.

Thermal control was planned to be achieved by a large number of small &quot;propeller blade&quot; devices on the surface of the sphere. The blades themselves were made of reflective material and consist of four vanes that were flush against the surface, covering a black heat-absorbing pattern painted on the sphere. A thermally sensitive coil was attached to the blades in such a way that low temperatures within the satellite would cause the coil to contract and rotate the blades and expose the heat-absorbing surface, and high temperatures would cause the blades to cover the black patterns. Square heat-sink units were also mounted on the surface of the sphere to help dissipate heat from the interior.

== On-board equipment ==
The scientific instruments consisted of an ion chamber and Geiger-MÃ¼ller tube to measure total radiation flux, a proportional radiation counter telescope to measure high energy radiation, a scintillation counter to monitor low-energy radiation, a VLF receiver for natural radio waves, a transponder to study electron density, and part of the television facsimile system and flux-gate and search coil magnetometers mounted on the instrument platform. The television camera pointed through a small hole in the sphere between two of the solar panel mounts. The micrometeorite detector was mounted on the sphere as well. The total mass of the science package including electronics and power supply was 55Â kg.

<doc id="82244" wikidata="Q1889947" url="?curid=82244" title="War Requiem">
<text>The War Requiem, Op. 66, is a choral and orchestral composition by Benjamin Britten, composed mostly in 1961 and completed in January 1962. The &quot;War Requiem&quot; was performed for the consecration of the new Coventry Cathedral, in the English county of Warwickshire, which was built after the original fourteenth-century structure was destroyed in a World War II bombing raid. The traditional Latin texts are interspersed, in telling juxtaposition, with extra-liturgical poems by Wilfred Owen, written during World War I.

Britten scored the work for soprano, tenor and baritone soloists, chorus, boys&#x27; choir, organ, and two orchestras (a full orchestra and a chamber orchestra). The chamber orchestra accompanies the intimate settings of the English poetry, while soprano, choirs and orchestra are used for the Latin sections; all forces are combined in the conclusion. The Requiem has a duration of approximately 80â85 minutes. In 2019, Britten&#x27;s 1963 recording of the &quot;War Requiem&quot; was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Composition==
The &quot;War Requiem&quot;, first performed on 30 May 1962, was commissioned to mark the consecration of the new Coventry Cathedral, which was built after the original 14th-century structure was destroyed in a World War II bombing raid. The reconsecration was an occasion for an arts festival, for which Michael Tippett also wrote his opera &quot;King Priam&quot;.

Britten, a pacifist and conscientious objector, was inspired by the commission, which gave him complete freedom in deciding what to compose. He chose to set the traditional Latin Mass for the Dead interwoven with nine poems about war by the English poet Wilfred Owen. Owen, who was born in 1893, was serving as the commander of a rifle company when he was killed in action on 4 November 1918 during the crossing of the SambreâOise Canal in France, just one week before the Armistice. Although he was virtually unknown at the time of his death, he has subsequently come to be revered as one of the great war poets.

Philip Reed has discussed the progression of Britten&#x27;s composition of the &quot;War Requiem&quot; in the Cambridge Music Handbook publication on the work. Britten himself acknowledged the stylistic influence of Requiems by other composers, such as Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s, on his own composition. David B. Greene has discussed Britten&#x27;s &#x27;indictment&#x27; of religious music in this work.

Britten dedicated the work to Roger Burney, Piers Dunkerley, David Gill, and Michael Halliday. Burney and Halliday, who died in the war, were friends of Peter Pears and Britten, respectively. According to the Britten-Pears Foundation&#x27;s &quot;War Requiem&quot; website, Dunkerley, one of Britten&#x27;s closest friends, took part in the 1944 Normandy landings. Unlike the other dedicatees, he survived the war but took his own life in June 1959, two months before his wedding. None of the other dedicatees have known graves, but are commemorated on memorials to the missing.

==Orchestration==
The musical forces are divided into three groups that alternate and interact with each other throughout the piece, finally fully combining at the end of the last movement. The soprano soloist and choir are accompanied by the full orchestra, the baritone and tenor soloists are accompanied by the chamber orchestra, and the boys&#x27; choir is accompanied by a small portative organ (this last group ideally being situated at some distance from the full orchestra). This group produces a very strange, distant sound. The soprano and choir and the boys&#x27; choir sing the traditional Latin Requiem text, while the tenor and baritone sing poems by Wilfred Owen, interspersed throughout.

The full orchestra consists of the following instrumentation.

==Movements and structure==
The work consists of six movements:

==Musical analysis==
The interval of a tritone between C and F is a recurring motif, the occurrence of which unifies the entire work. The interval is used both in contexts that emphasize the harmonic distance between C and F and those that resolve them harmonically, mirroring the theme of conflict and reconciliation present throughout the work. The &quot;Requiem aeternam&quot;, &quot;Dies irae&quot;, and &quot;Libera me&quot; movements end in a brief choral phrase, consisting mainly of slow half notes, each first and second phrase ending on a tritone&#x27;s discord, with every last (&quot;i.Â e.&quot; third) phrase resolving to an F-major chord; while at the end of the &quot;Agnus Dei&quot; the tenor (in his only transition from the Owen poems to the Requiem liturgy, on the key words, &quot;Dona nobis pacem&quot; â Give us peace) outlines a perfect fifth from C to G before moving down to F to resolve the chorus&#x27;s final chord. At the end of the &quot;Dies irae&quot;, the tenor sings (from Owen&#x27;s &quot;Futility&quot;) &quot;O what, what made fatuous sunbeams toil, to break earth&#x27;s sleep at all?&quot; The notes of &quot;at all&quot; form the tritone and lead into the choir&#x27;s formal resolution. In the final Owen setting, &quot;Strange Meeting&quot;, one of the most prominent expressions of the tritone is sung by the tenor, addressing an opposing soldier with the words &quot;Strange friend&quot;. This poem is accompanied by sporadic detached chords from two violins and a viola, which include the tritone as part of a dominant seventh chord. At the end of the poem, the final string chord resolves to the tonic, bringing the work to its final, reconciliatory &quot;In paradisum&quot;. On a more practical level, Britten facilitated musical execution of the tritone in the closing bars by having the F sung in one voice, but the C in another.

Four other motifs that usually occur together are distinct brass fanfares of the &quot;Dies irae&quot;: a rising arpeggio, a falling arpeggio followed by a repeated note, a repeated fourth in a dotted rhythm ending in a diminished arpeggio, and a descending scale. These motifs form a substantial part of the melodic material of the piece: the setting of &quot;Bugles sang&quot; is composed almost entirely of variations of them.

Another linking feature can be found in the opening of the final movement, &quot;Libera Me&quot;, where the slow march tune in the double basses (preceded by two drums outlining the rhythm) replicates the more-rapid opening theme of the first poem, &quot;Anthem for Doomed Youth&quot;.

One striking juxtaposition is found in the Offertorium, a fugue in the repeating three-part-time scheme , , where the choir sings of God&#x27;s promise to Abraham (&quot;Quam olim Abrahae promisisti, et semini eius&quot; â &quot;which you once promised Abraham and his seed&quot;). This frames Owen&#x27;s retelling of the offering of Isaac, in which the angel tells Abraham to:

As the male soloists sing the last line repeatedly, the boys sing &quot;Hostias et preces tibi, Domine&quot; (&quot;Sacrifice and prayers we offer thee, Lord&quot;), paralleling the sacrifice of the Mass with the sacrifice of &quot;half the seed of Europe&quot; (a reference to World War I). The &quot;reprise&quot; of &quot;Quam olim Abrahae&quot; is sung in inversion, diminuendo instead of crescendo.

The whole of the Offertorium is a reference to Britten&#x27;s earlier &quot;Canticle II: Abraham and Isaac&quot; from 1952. Britten here uses much of the musical material of the earlier work, but the music in the Requiem is twisted into much more sinister forms.

Although there are a few occasions in which members of one orchestra join the other, the full forces do not join until the latter part of the last movement, when the tenor and baritone sing the final line of Owen&#x27;s poem &quot;&quot; (&quot;Let us sleep nowÂ ...&quot;) as &quot;In Paradisum deducant&quot; (&quot;Into Paradise lead themÂ ...&quot;) is sung first by the boys&#x27; choir, then by the full choir (in 8-part canon), and finally by the soprano. The boys&#x27; choir echoes the &quot;Requiem aeternam&quot; from the beginning of the work, and the full choir ends on the resolved tritone motif.

==Premiere and notable performances==
===Premiere===
For the opening performance, Britten intended that the soloists should be Galina Vishnevskaya (a Russian), Peter Pears (an Englishman) and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau (a German), to demonstrate a spirit of unity. Close to the premiere, the Soviet authorities did not permit Vishnevskaya to travel to Coventry for the event, although she was later permitted to leave to make the recording in London. With only ten days&#x27; notice, Heather Harper stepped in and performed the soprano role.

Although the Coventry Cathedral Festival Committee had hoped Britten would be the sole conductor for the work&#x27;s premiere, shoulder pain forced his withdrawal from the main conducting role. He did, however, conduct the chamber orchestra, and this spawned a tradition of separate conductors that the work does not require and Britten never envisaged. The premiere took place on 30 May 1962, in the rebuilt cathedral with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Meredith Davies (accompanying soprano and chorus), and the Melos Ensemble, conducted by the composer (accompanying tenor and baritone). At Britten&#x27;s request, there was no applause following the performance. It was a triumph, and critics and audiences at this and subsequent performances in London and abroad hailed it as a contemporary masterpiece. Writing to his sister after the premiere, Britten said of his music, &quot;I hope it&#x27;ll make people think a bit.&quot; On the title page of the score he quoted Wilfred Owen:

Because of time zones, the southern hemisphere premiere was about 12 hours ahead of that in North America, though they were on the same day, 27 July 1963. The southern hemisphere premiere was at the Town Hall in Wellington, New Zealand, with John Hopkins conducting the New Zealand National Orchestra (now the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra) and the Royal Christchurch Musical Society, with soloists Peter Baillie, Graeme Gorton and Angela Shaw. The North American premiere was at Tanglewood, with Erich Leinsdorf conducting the Boston Symphony Orchestra with soloists Phyllis Curtin, Nicholas Di Virgilio, Tom Krause and choruses from Chorus Pro Musica and the Columbus Boychoir, featuring boy soprano Thomas Friedman.

The Dutch premiere took place during the Holland Festival, in 1964. The Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam and the Netherlands Radio Choir were conducted by Bernard Haitink; the chamber orchestra (consisting of Concertgebouw Orchestra instrumentalists) by Britten himself. The soloists were Vishnevskaya, Fischer-Dieskau and Pears, in their first public performance together.

The English Chamber Choir performed the work at &quot;Your Country Needs You&quot;, an evening of &quot;voices in opposition to war&quot; organised by The Crass Collective in November 2002.

To commemorate the eve of the 70th anniversary of the destruction of the original cathedral, a performance of the Requiem took place in the new cathedral on 13 November 2010, featuring the soprano Claire Rutter, the tenor Daniel Norman, baritone Stephen Gadd, The Parliament Choir, Saint Michael&#x27;s singers, Deutscher Chor London, the ESO Chamber Orchestra, The Southbank Sinfonia and Coventry Cathedral Girls&#x27; Choir. It was conducted by Simon Over and Paul Leddington Wright. A recording was made and broadcast a day later on Classic FM. A second performance with the same performers took place on 17 November 2010 at Westminster Cathedral.

A 50th anniversary performance was given by the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra conducted by Andris Nelsons at Coventry Cathedral on 30 May 2012.

As part of Lincolnshire Remembers commemoration of the centenary of the end of the First World War, Lincoln Cathedral hosted a performance of Britten&#x27;s War Requiem. On Saturday 3 November 2018, singers from Lincoln Choral Society, Gainsborough Choral Society, Scunthorpe Choral Society, Grimsby Philharmonic Society, Louth Choral Society, Neustadt Liedertafel, and the Choristers of Lincoln Cathedral were joined by the Lincolnshire Chamber Orchestra. The soloists were Rachel Nicholls (soprano), Alessandro Fisher (tenor) and Julien Van Mallaerts (baritone). The organist was Jeffrey Makinson, and the pianist was Jonathon Gooing. The conductors were Mark Wilde, Susan Hollingworth and Aric Prentice.

==Recordings==

The first recording, featuring Vishnevskaya, Fischer-Dieskau and Pears, with the London Symphony Orchestra and The Bach Choir conducted by Britten, was produced by Decca in 1963. Within five months of its release it sold 200,000 copies, an unheard-of number for a piece of contemporary classical music at that time. Recording producer John Culshaw reports that Vishnevskaya threw a tantrum during the recording, as she believedÂ â not having performed the work beforeÂ â she was being insulted by being placed with the choir instead of at the front with the male soloists. The newest (2013) CD reissue of this recording includes 50 minutes of surreptitiously taped rehearsal footage at the time of the recording.

==Film adaptation==
In 1988, Derek Jarman made a screen adaptation of &quot;War Requiem&quot; of the same title, with the 1963 recording as the soundtrack, produced by Don Boyd and financed by the BBC. It includes the final film performance of Laurence Olivier, in the role of an ageing war veteran.

<text>The GeigerâMÃ¼ller tube or GâM tube is the sensing element of the Geiger counter instrument used for the detection of ionizing radiation. It is named after Hans Geiger, who invented the principle in 1908, and Walther MÃ¼ller, who collaborated with Geiger in developing the technique further in 1928 to produce a practical tube that could detect a number of different radiation types.

It is a gaseous ionization detector and uses the Townsend avalanche phenomenon to produce an easily detectable electronic pulse from as little as a single ionizing event due to a radiation particle. It is used for the detection of gamma radiation, X-rays, and alpha and beta particles. It can also be adapted to detect neutrons. The tube operates in the &quot;Geiger&quot; region of ion pair generation. This is shown on the accompanying plot for gaseous detectors showing ion current against applied voltage.

While it is a robust and inexpensive detector, the GâM is unable to measure high radiation rates efficiently, has a finite life in high radiation areas and cannot measure incident radiation energy, so no spectral information can be generated and there is no discrimination between radiation types; such as between alpha and beta particles.

== Principle of operation ==

A G-M tube consists of a chamber filled with a gas mixture at a low pressure of about 0.1 atmosphere. The chamber contains two electrodes, between which there is a potential difference of several hundred volts. The walls of the tube are either metal or have their inside surface coated with a conducting material or a spiral wire to form the cathode, while the anode is a wire mounted axially in the center of the chamber.

When ionizing radiation strikes the tube, some molecules of the fill gas are ionized directly by the incident radiation, and if the tube cathode is an electrical conductor, such as stainless steel, indirectly by means of secondary electrons produced in the walls of the tube, which migrate into the gas. This creates positively charged ions and free electrons, known as ion pairs, in the gas. The strong electric field created by the voltage across the tube&#x27;s electrodes accelerates the positive ions towards the cathode and the electrons towards the anode. Close to the anode in the &quot;avalanche region&quot; where the electric field strength rises inversely proportional to radial distance as the anode is approached, free electrons gain sufficient energy to ionize additional gas molecules by collision and create a large number of electron avalanches. These spread along the anode and effectively throughout the avalanche region. This is the &quot;gas multiplication&quot; effect which gives the tube its key characteristic of being able to produce a significant output pulse from a single original ionizing event.
If there were to be only one avalanche per original ionizing event, then the number of excited molecules would be in the order of 106 to 108. However the production of &quot;multiple avalanches&quot; results in an increased multiplication factor which can produce 109 to 1010 ion pairs. The creation of multiple avalanches is due to the production of UV photons in the original avalanche, which are not affected by the electric field and move laterally to the axis of the anode to instigate further ionizing events by collision with gas molecules. These collisions produce further avalanches, which in turn produce more photons, and thereby more avalanches in a chain reaction which spreads laterally through the fill gas, and envelops the anode wire. The accompanying diagram shows this graphically. The speed of propagation of the avalanches is typically 2â4Â cm per microsecond, so that for common sizes of tubes the complete ionization of the gas around the anode takes just a few microseconds.
This short, intense pulse of current can be measured as a &quot;count event&quot; in the form of a voltage pulse developed across an external electrical resistor. This can be in the order of volts, thus making further electronic processing simple.

The discharge is terminated by the collective effect of the positive ions created by the avalanches. These ions have lower mobility than the free electrons due to their higher mass and move slowly from the vicinity of the anode wire. This creates a &quot;space charge&quot; which counteracts the electric field that is necessary for continued avalanche generation. For a particular tube geometry and operating voltage this termination always occurs when a certain number of avalanches has been created, therefore the pulses from the tube are always of the same magnitude regardless of the energy of the initiating particle. Consequently, there is no radiation energy information in the pulses which means the GeigerâMÃ¼ller tube cannot be used to generate spectral information about the incident radiation. In practice the termination of the avalanche is improved by the use of &quot;quenching&quot; techniques (see later).
Pressure of the fill gas is important in the generation of avalanches. Too low a pressure and the efficiency of interaction with incident radiation is reduced. Too high a pressure, and the âmean free pathâ for collisions between accelerated electrons and the fill gas is too small, and the electrons cannot gather enough energy between each collision to cause ionization of the gas. The energy gained by electrons is proportional to the ratio âe/pâ, where âeâ is the electric field strength at that point in the gas, and âpâ is the gas pressure.

==Types of tube==
Broadly, there are two important types of Geiger tube construction.

===End window type===

For alpha particles, low energy beta particles, and low energy X-rays, the usual form is a cylindrical end-window tube. This type has a window at one end covered in a thin material through which low-penetrating radiation can easily pass. Mica is a commonly used material due to its low mass per unit area. The other end houses the electrical connection to the anode.

====Pancake tube====
The pancake tube is a variant of the end window tube, but which is designed for use for beta and gamma contamination monitoring. It has roughly the same sensitivity to particles as the end window type, but has a flat annular shape so the largest window area can be utilized with a minimum of gas space. Like the cylindrical end window tube, mica is a commonly used window material due to its low mass per unit area. The anode is normally multi-wired in concentric circles so it extends fully throughout the gas space.

===Windowless type===
This general type is distinct from the dedicated end window type, but has two main sub-types, which use different radiation interaction mechanisms to obtain a count.

====Thick walled====

Used for gamma radiation detection above energies of about 25 KeV, this type generally has an overall wall thickness of about 1-2mm of chrome steel. Because most high energy gamma photons will pass through the low density fill gas without interacting, the tube uses the interaction of photons on the molecules of the wall material to produce high energy secondary electrons within the wall. Some of these electrons are produced close enough to the inner wall of the tube to escape into the fill gas. As soon as this happens the electron drifts to the anode and an electron avalanche occurs as though the free electron had been created within the gas. The avalanche is a secondary effect of a process that starts within the tube wall with the production of electrons that migrate to the inner surface of the tube wall, and then enter the fill gas. This effect is considerably attenuated at low energies below about 20 KeV 

====Thin walled====
Thin walled tubes are used for:
* High energy beta detection, where the beta enters via the side of the tube and interacts directly with the gas, but the radiation has to be energetic enough to penetrate the tube wall. Low energy beta, which would penetrate an end window, would be stopped by the tube wall. 
* Low energy gamma and X-ray detection. The lower energy photons interact better with the fill gas so this design concentrates on increasing the volume of the fill gas by using a long thin walled tube and does not use the interaction of photons in the tube wall. The transition from thin walled to thick walled design takes place at the 300â400 keV energy levels. Above these levels thick walled designs are used, and beneath these levels the direct gas ionization effect is predominant.

===Neutron detection===

GâM tubes will not detect neutrons since these do not ionize the gas. However, neutron-sensitive tubes can be produced which either have the inside of the tube coated with boron, or the tube contains boron trifluoride or helium-3 as the fill gas, or the tube is wrapped in about thick cadmium foil. The neutrons interact with the boron nuclei, producing alpha particles, or directly with the helium-3 nuclei producing hydrogen and tritium ions and electrons, or with the cadmium, producing gamma rays. These energetic particles interact and produce ions that then trigger the normal avalanche process.

==Gas mixtures==
The components of the gas mixture are vital to the operation and application of a G-M tube. The mixture is composed of an inert gas such as helium, argon or neon which is ionized by incident radiation, and a &quot;quench&quot; gas of 5â10% of an organic vapor or a halogen gas to prevent spurious pulsing by quenching the electron avalanches. This combination of gases is known as a Penning mixture and makes use of the Penning ionization effect.

The modern halogen-filled GâM tube was invented by Sidney H. Liebson in 1947 and has several advantages over the older tubes with organic mixtures. The halogen tube discharge takes advantage of a metastable state of the inert gas atom to more-readily ionize a halogen molecule than an organic vapor, enabling the tube to operate at much lower voltages, typically 400â600 volts instead of 900â1200 volts. While halogen-quenched tubes have greater plateau voltage slopes compared to organic-quenched tubes (an undesirable quality), they have a vastly longer life than tubes quenched with organic compounds. This is because an organic vapor is gradually destroyed by the discharge process, giving organic-quenched tubes a useful life of around 109 events. However, halogen ions can recombine over time, giving halogen-quenched tubes an effectively unlimited lifetime for most uses, although they will still eventually fail at some point due to other ionization-initiated processes that limit the lifetime of all Geiger tubes. For these reasons, the halogen-quenched tube is now the most common.

Neon is the most common filler gas. Chlorine is the most common quencher, though bromine is occasionally used as well. Halogens are most commonly used with neon, argon or krypton, organic quenchers with helium.

An example of a gas mixture, used primarily in proportional detectors, is P10 (90% argon, 10% methane).
Another is used in bromine-quenched tubes, typically 0.1% argon, 1-2% bromine, and the balance of neon.

Halogen quenchers are highly chemically reactive and attack the materials of the electrodes, especially at elevated temperatures, leading to tube performance degradation over time. The cathode materials can be chosen from e.g. chromium, platinum, or nickel-copper alloy, or coated with colloidal graphite, and suitably passivated. Oxygen plasma treatment can provide a passivation layer on stainless steel. Dense non-porous coating with platinum or a tungsten layer or a tungsten foil liner can provide protection here.

Pure noble gases exhibit threshold voltages increasing with increasing atomic weight. Addition of polyatomic organic quenchers increases threshold voltage, due to dissipation of large percentage of collisions energy in molecular vibrations. Argon with alcohol vapors was one of the most common fills of early tubes. As little as 1 ppm of impurities (argon, mercury, and krypton in neon) can significantly lower the threshold voltage. Admixture of chlorine or bromine provides quenching and stability to low-voltage neon-argon mixtures, with wide temperature range. Lower operating voltages lead to longer rise times of pulses, without appreciably changing the dead times.

Spurious pulses are caused mostly by secondary electrons emitted by the cathode due to positive ion bombardment. The resulting spurious pulses have the nature of a relaxation oscillator and show uniform spacing, dependent on the tube fill gas and overvoltage. At high enough overvoltages, but still below the onset of continuous corona discharges, sequences of thousands of pulses can be produced. Such spurious counts can be suppressed by coating the cathode with higher work function materials, chemical passivation, lacquer coating, etc.

The organic quenchers can decompose to smaller molecules (ethyl alcohol and ethyl acetate) or polymerize into solid deposits (typical for methane). Degradation products of organic molecules may or may not have quenching properties. Larger molecules degrade to more quenching products than small ones; tubes quenched with amyl acetate tend to have ten times higher lifetime than ethanol ones. Tubes quenched with hydrocarbons often fail due to coating of the electrodes with polymerization products, before the gas itself can be depleted; simple gas refill won&#x27;t help, washing the electrodes to remove the deposits is necessary. Low ionization efficiency is sometimes deliberately sought; mixtures of low pressure hydrogen or helium with organic quenchers are used in some cosmic rays experiments, to detect heavily ionizing muons and electrons.

Argon, krypton and xenon are used to detect soft x-rays, with increasing absorption of low energy photons with decreasing atomic mass, due to direct ionization by photoelectric effect. Above 60-70 keV the direct ionization of the filler gas becomes insignificant, and secondary photoelectrons, Compton electrons or electron-positron pair production by interaction of the gamma photons with the cathode material become the dominant ionization initiation mechanisms. Tube windows can be eliminated by putting the samples directly inside the tube, or, if gaseous, mixing them with the filler gas. Vacuum-tightness requirement can be eliminated by using continuous flow of gas at atmospheric pressure.

==Geiger plateau==

The &quot;Geiger plateau&quot; is the voltage range in which the G-M tube operates in its correct mode, where ionization occurs along the length of the anode. If a GâM tube is exposed to a steady radiation source and the applied voltage is increased from zero, it follows the plot of current shown in the &quot;Geiger region&quot; where the gradient flattens; this is the Geiger plateau.

This is shown in more detail in the accompanying Geiger Plateau Curve diagram. If the tube voltage is progressively increased from zero the efficiency of detection will rise until the most energetic radiation starts to produce pulses which can be detected by the electronics. This is the &quot;starting voltage&quot;. Increasing the voltage still further results in rapidly rising counts until the &quot;knee&quot; or threshold of the plateau is reached, where the rate of increase of counts falls off. This is where the tube voltage is sufficient to allow a complete discharge along the anode for each detected radiation count, and the effect of different radiation energies are equal. However, the plateau has a slight slope mainly due to the lower electric fields at the ends of the anode because of tube geometry. As the tube voltage is increased, these fields strengthen to produce avalanches. At the end of the plateau the count rate begins to increase rapidly again, until the onset of continuous discharge where the tube cannot detect radiation, and may be damaged.

Depending on the characteristics of the specific tube (manufacturer, size, gas type, etc.) the voltage range of the plateau will vary. The slope is usually expressed as percentage change of counts per 100Â V. To prevent overall efficiency changes due to variation of tube voltage, a regulated voltage supply is used, and it is normal practice to operate in the middle of the plateau to reduce the effect of any voltage variations.

== Quenching and dead time ==

The ideal GâM tube should produce a single pulse for every single ionizing event due to radiation. It should not give spurious pulses, and should recover quickly to the passive state, ready for the next radiation event. However, when positive argon ions reach the cathode and become neutral atoms by gaining electrons, the atoms can be elevated to enhanced energy levels. These atoms then return to their ground state by emitting photons which in turn produce further ionization and thereby spurious secondary discharges. If nothing were done to counteract this, ionization would be prolonged and could even escalate. The prolonged avalanche would increase the &quot;dead time&quot; when new events cannot be detected, and could become continuous and damage the tube. Some form of quenching of the ionization is therefore essential to reduce the dead time and protect the tube, and a number of quenching techniques are used.

===Gas quenching===
Self-quenching or internal-quenching tubes stop the discharge without external assistance, originally by means of the addition of a small amount of a polyatomic organic vapor originally such as butane or ethanol, but for modern tubes is a halogen such as bromine or chlorine.

If a poor gas quencher is introduced to the tube, the positive argon ions, during their motion toward the cathode, would have multiple collisions with the quencher gas molecules and transfer their charge and some energy to them. Thus, neutral argon atoms would be produced and the quencher gas ions in their turn would reach the cathode, gain electrons therefrom, and move into excited states which would decay by photon emission, producing tube discharge. However, effective quencher molecules, when excited, lose their energy not by photon emission, but by dissociation into neutral quencher molecules. No spurious pulses are thus produced.

Even with chemical quenching, for a short time after a discharge pulse there is a period during which the tube is rendered insensitive and is thus temporarily unable to detect the arrival of any new ionizing particle (the so-called &quot;dead time&quot;; typically 50â100 microseconds). This causes a loss of counts at sufficiently high count rates and limits the GâM tube to an effective (accurate) count rate of approximately 103 counts per second even with external quenching. While a G-M tube is technically capable of reading higher count rates before it truly saturates, the level of uncertainty involved and the risk of saturation makes it extremely dangerous to rely upon higher count rate readings when attempting to calculate an equivalent radiation dose rate from the count rate. A consequence of this is that ion chamber instruments are usually preferred for higher count rates, however a modern external quenching technique can extend this upper limit considerably.

===External quenching===
External quenching, sometimes called &quot;active quenching&quot; or &quot;electronic quenching&quot;, uses simplistic high speed control electronics to rapidly remove and re-apply the high voltage between the electrodes for a fixed time after each discharge peak in order to increase the maximum count rate and lifetime of the tube. Although this can be used instead of a quench gas, it is much more commonly used in conjunction with a quench gas.

The &quot;time-to-first-count method&quot; is a sophisticated modern implementation of external quenching that allows for dramatically increased maximum count rates via the use of statistical signal processing techniques and much more complex control electronics. Due to uncertainty in the count rate introduced by the simplistic implementation of external quenching, the count rate of a Geiger tube becomes extremely unreliable above approximately 103 counts per second. With the time-to-first-count method, effective count rates of 105 counts per second are achievable, two orders of magnitude larger than the normal effective limit. The time-to-first-count method is significantly more complicated to implement than traditional external quenching methods, and as a result of this it has not seen widespread use.

==Fold-back effect==
One consequence of the dead time effect is the possibility of a high count rate continually triggering the tube before the recovery time has elapsed. This may produce pulses too small for the counting electronics to detect and lead to the very undesirable situation whereby a GâM counter in a very high radiation field is falsely indicating a low level. This phenomenon is known as &quot;fold-back&quot;. An industry rule of thumb is that the discriminator circuit receiving the output from the tube should detect down to 1/10 of the magnitude of a normal pulse to guard against this. Additionally the circuit should detect when &quot;pulse pile-up &quot; has occurred, where the apparent anode voltage has moved to a new DC level through the combination of high pulse count and noise. The electronic design of GeigerâMÃ¼ller counters must be able to detect this situation and give an alarm; it is normally done by setting a threshold for excessive tube current.

==Detection efficiency==
The efficiency of detection of a GâM tube varies with the type of incident radiation. Tubes with thin end windows have very high efficiencies (can be nearly 100%) for high energy beta, though this drops off as the beta energy decreases due to attenuation by the window material. Alpha particles are also attenuated by the window. As alpha particles have a maximum range of less than 50Â mm in air, the detection window should be as close as possible to the source of radiation. The attenuation of the window adds to the attenuation of air, so the window should have a density as low as 1.5 to 2.0Â mg/cm2 to give an acceptable level of detection efficiency. The article on stopping power explains in more detail the ranges for particles types of various energies.
The counting efficiency of photon radiation (gamma and X-rays above 25Â keV) depends on the efficiency of radiation interaction in the tube wall, which increases with the atomic number of the wall material. Chromium iron is a commonly used material, which gives an efficiency of about 1% over a wide range of energies.

==Photon energy compensation==

If a GâM tube is to be used for gamma or X-ray dosimetry measurements, the energy of incident radiation, which affects the ionizing effect, must be taken into account. However pulses from a GâM tube do not carry any energy information, and attribute equal dose to each count event. Consequently, the count rate response of a &quot;bare&quot; GâM tube to photons at different energy levels is non-linear with the effect of over-reading at low energies. The variation in dose response can be a factor between 5 and 15, according to individual tube construction; the very small tubes having the highest values.

To correct this a technique known as &quot;energy compensation&quot; is applied, which consists of adding a shield of absorbing material around the tube. This filter preferentially absorbs the low energy photons and the dose response is &quot;flattened&quot;. The aim is that sensitivity/energy characteristic of the tube should be matched by the absorption/energy characteristic of the filter. This cannot be exactly achieved, but the result is a more uniform response over the stated range of detection energies for the tube.

Lead and tin are commonly used materials, and a simple filter effective above can be made using a continuous collar along the length of the tube. However, at lower energy levels this attenuation can become too great, so air gaps are left in the collar to allow low energy radiation to have a greater effect. In practice, compensation filter design is an empirical compromise to produce an acceptably uniform response, and a number of different materials and geometries are used to obtain the required correction.

<text>Pioneer P-30 (also known as Able 5A, Atlas-Able 5A, or Pioneer Y) was intended to be a lunar orbiter probe, but the mission failed shortly after launch on September 25, 1960. The objectives were to place a highly instrumented probe in lunar orbit, to investigate the environment between the Earth and Moon, and to develop technology for controlling and maneuvering spacecraft from Earth. It was equipped to estimate the Moon&#x27;s mass and topography of the poles, record the distribution and velocity of micrometeorites, and study radiation, magnetic fields, and low frequency electromagnetic waves in space. A mid-course propulsion system and injection rocket would have been the first United States self-contained propulsion system capable of operation many months after launch at great distances from Earth and the first U.S. tests of maneuvering a satellite in space.

==Mission==

Nearly a year passed between the first Atlas-Able launch in November 1959 and this second attempt due to a shortage of Atlas boosters as well as intense competition between NASA and the U.S. Air Force for use of the pads at Cape Canaveral. The spacecraft was launched on Atlas 80D coupled to Thor-Able upper stages including a Hercules ABL solid-propellant third stage, one year and a day after the Atlas-Able pad explosion on LC-12. While P-3 had used a recycled booster from the Mercury program, which had a number of custom modifications, P-30&#x27;s launch vehicle (Atlas 80D) was a standard-configuration Atlas D ICBM with the exception of thicker skin to support the additional weight of the upper stages. Atlas BECO was performed at T+250 seconds and SECO at T+275 seconds. Vernier solo mode was not planned for this launch due to the direct ascent trajectory and VECO was to take place at T+280 seconds, however, a malfunction of a timer relay prevented this from happening and the verniers continued operating until propellant depletion. There were also minor problems with the Atlas pneumatic and flight control systems, however, none of them negatively affected overall booster performance. At an altitude of about , the first stage separated from the second stage. The Able second stage ignited and started up properly, however, thrust quickly decayed and then dropped to zero. The vehicle was unable to achieve Earth orbit, re-entered, and was believed to have come down somewhere in the Indian Ocean. Signals were returned by the payload for 17 minutes after launch. The mission was designed to reach the Moon approximately 62 hours after launch. The second stage malfunction was attributed to a loss of pressure in the propellant feed system, starving the engine of oxidizer. Although the mission was a failure, ground controllers fired Able VA&#x27;s onboard liquid propellant hydrazine rocket engine â the first time that an onboard motor was fired on a space vehicle.

== Spacecraft design ==

Pioneer P-30 was almost identical to the earlier Pioneer P-3 satellite which failed, a 1-meter diameter sphere with a propulsion system mounted on the bottom giving a total length of . The mass of the structure and aluminum alloy shell was about and the propulsion units roughly . Four solar panels, each and containing 2200 solar cells in 22 100-cell nodules, extended from the sides of the spherical shell in a &quot;paddle-wheel&quot; configuration with a total span of about . The solar panels charged nickel-cadmium batteries. Inside the shell, a large spherical hydrazine tank made up most of the volume, topped by two smaller spherical nitrogen tanks and a 90 N injection rocket to slow the spacecraft down to go into lunar orbit, which was designed to be capable of firing twice during the mission. Attached to the bottom of the sphere was a 90 N vernier rocket for mid-course propulsion and lunar orbit maneuvers which could be fired four times.

Around the upper hemisphere of the hydrazine tank was a ring-shaped instrument platform which held the batteries in two packs, two 1.5 W UHF transmitters and diplexers, logic modules for scientific instruments, two command receivers, decoders, a buffer/amplifier, three converters, a telebit, a command box, and most of the scientific instruments. Two dipole UHF antennas protruded from the top of the sphere on either side of the injection rocket nozzle. Two dipole UHF antennas and a long VLF antenna protruded from the bottom of the sphere. The transmitters operated on a frequency of 378 megahertz.

Thermal control was planned to be achieved by fifty small &quot;propeller blade&quot; devices on the surface of the sphere. The blades themselves were made of reflective material and consist of four vanes which were flush against the surface, covering a black heat-absorbing pattern painted on the sphere. A thermally sensitive coil was attached to the blades in such a way that low temperatures within the satellite would cause the coil to contract and rotate the blades and expose the heat-absorbing surface, and high temperatures would cause the blades to cover the black patterns. Square heat-sink units were also mounted on the surface of the sphere to help dissipate heat from the interior.

== On-board equipment ==

The scientific instruments consisted of an ion chamber and Geiger-MÃ¼ller tube to measure total radiation flux, a proportional radiation counter telescope to measure high energy radiation, a scintillation counter to monitor low-energy radiation, a VLF receiver for natural radio waves, a transponder to study electron density, and part of the flux-gate and search coil magnetometers mounted on the instrument platform. The micrometeorite detector and sun scanner were mounted on the sphere. The difference between the payload of Pioneer P-30 and the earlier Pioneer P-3 was the replacement of the TV facsimile system on P-3 with a scintillation spectrometer to study the Earth&#x27;s (and possible lunar) radiation belts, mounted on the instrument platform, and a plasma probe mounted on the sphere to measure energy and momentum distribution of protons above a few kilovolts to study the radiation effect of solar flares. The total mass of the science package including electronics and power supply was roughly . The total cost of the mission was estimated at 9â10 million dollars.

The objectives were to place a highly instrumented probe in lunar orbit, to investigate the environment between the Earth and Moon, and to develop technology for controlling and maneuvering spacecraft from Earth.

==Mission==

The spacecraft was launched on Atlas vehicle 91D coupled to Thor-Able upper stages including an Able solid propellant third stage on 15 December 1960. The launch was uneventful until T+66 seconds when a severe axial disturbance was recorded, followed by rapid loss of LOX tank pressure and changes in the Atlas&#x27;s engine exhaust indicative of oxidizer starvation. At T+73 seconds, the Atlas experienced total structural breakup and loss of telemetry. The upper stages continued transmitting data until impact with the ocean. The payload fell into the Atlantic Ocean 12 to 20Â km (7 to 12 miles) from Cape Canaveral in about 20 meter (65 feet) deep water. A Navy salvage operation recovered parts of the launch vehicle and the payload. The immediate cause of the failure was unclear, but thought to be related to either the adapter mating the Able stages to the Atlas coming loose and being rammed into the LOX tank or else aerodynamic buffeting on the launch vehicle. The recovered Able second stage showed no sign that engine ignition or operation had taken place, and the most probable cause of the failure was believed to be aerodynamic flexing of the Able adapter which then ruptured the Atlas&#x27;s LOX tank. The crippled booster continued to fly for a few seconds afterwards, but the structural collapse of the Atlas&#x27;s forward section combined with the loss of LOX pressure to the propellant feed system resulted in engine shutdown and vehicle self-destruction.

As a result of this failure and Mercury-Atlas 1 five months earlier due to a similar episode of aerodynamic bending in the forward portion of the LOX tank, GD/A began requiring that all Atlas upper stage/payload combinations undergo proper structural dynamics testing.

The failure was described as &quot;especially disappointing&quot; since it was the final launch in the Able probe series as its successor, the Ranger program, was in the works. In the end, the US space program would not see a completely successful lunar probe until Ranger 7 four years later. It also marked the final launch in the first generation of lunar probes, which used direct ascent trajectories and would give way to the second generation probes which had parking orbits.

Pioneer P-31 was virtually identical to the earlier Pioneer P-30 satellite which failed, a 1-meter diameter sphere with a propulsion system mounted on the bottom giving a total length of 1.4 meters. The mass of the structure and aluminum alloy shell was about 30Â kg and the propulsion units roughly 90Â kg.

The micrometeorite detector and sun scanner were mounted on the sphere as well. The only difference between Pioneer P-31 and the earlier Pioneer P-30 was the addition of a solid state detector sensitive to low energy protons on the satellite and an STL-designed rubidium frequency standard experiment placed on a pod attached to the booster. The total mass of the science package including electronics and power supply was roughly 60Â kg. Total cost of the mission was estimated at 9â10 million dollars.

<text>Tyazhely Sputnik (, meaning &quot;Heavy Satellite&quot;), also known by its development name as Venera 1VA No.Â 1, and in the West as SputnikÂ 7, was a Soviet spacecraft, which was intended to be the first spacecraft to explore Venus. Due to a problem with its upper stage it failed to leave low Earth orbit. In order to avoid acknowledging the failure, the Soviet government instead announced that the entire spacecraft, including the upper stage, was a test of a &quot;Heavy Satellite&quot; which would serve as a launch platform for future missions. This resulted in the upper stage being considered a separate spacecraft, from which the probe was &quot;launched&quot;, on several subsequent missions.

Although Soviet program planners intended for missions to both Mars and Venus on the new 8K78 booster, the effort during 1960 was mainly spent on the former. The Mars 1MV bus could also be used for a Venus probe with some modifications such as heat-insulating foil to protect the probe from hot temperatures in the inner solar system but Earth-based telescopes had already shown that Venus was covered in dense clouds with no visible surface, so photography of the planet would be a waste of time. However, a lander was still possible and the Venus launch window would be at its optimal point in January 1961 while the United States was a long way from attempting any kind of planetary mission yet--Pioneer 5 was intended for a Venus flyby with a launch date in November 1959 but its launch got delayed four months after which the window closed so it was just flown on a deep space data gathering mission instead.

The two Soviet Mars shots in October 1960 failed to reach orbit after which effort shifted to the Venus probes. The Blok L stage of the 8K78 rocket had not gotten a chance to be tested and was still a question mark as nobody had any experience yet starting a rocket engine in space. Testing of the Venus probe at Baikonur began 8 January but just like with the Mars probes the craft developed endless technical issues which were difficult to fix or diagnose as large portions of it had to be taken apart or dismantled to get at various components.

The booster, vehicle L1-7V, was erected on LC-1 on 1 February. During prelaunch preparations and fueling, a potentially dangerous situation occurred when nitrogen from the probe&#x27;s orientation system began to bleed out. The memory of the Nedelin Catastrophe was still fresh and if the engine valves opened, the Blok L could ignite on the pad, potentially destroying the entire launch vehicle. Pad crews managed to lift the probe on its crane off the stack and turn the power off. It was found out that a slight movement of the probe while being placed on the stack had caused its onboard systems to think it was in space and had separated from the rocket, so it tried to carry out a communication session with the ground. A lock was installed on the probe until it was properly stacked. On 3 February, the roll gyro in the Blok I stage malfunctioned and had to be replaced.

Tyazhely Sputnik was launched at 01:18:03 UTC on 4 February 1961, atop a Molniya 8K78 carrier rocket flying from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. The booster steered downrange into the night sky and could be seen for at least minutes. Everything worked perfectly up to the moment of orbital injection. However, tracking ships stationed in the Mediterranean Sea, in the Pacific Ocean, and off West Africa reported no Blok L engine start. The mission was a failure due to an embarrassing design oversight--the power transformer on the Blok L failed as it was not designed to operate in a vacuum. It was the largest payload yet launched into space and was a complete failure. TASS officially reported it as a &quot;test payload.&quot; An attempt by Soviet air force tracking to search for the probe and Blok L a week later failed to locate it as by that time it had reentered the atmosphere. It re-entered the atmosphere over Siberia on 26 February 1961.

According to the memoirs of Boris Chertok, &quot;A pendant shaped like a small globe with the continents etched on it was placed on the 1VA. Inside this small sphere was a medal depicting the Earth-to-Venus flight path. On the other side of the medal was the emblem of the Soviet Union. The pendant was placed in a spherical capsule with thermal shielding to protect it during entry into Venus&#x27; atmosphere at reentry velocity.&quot; In what he refers to as a &quot;Strange but True [incident]... in the history of cosmonautics&quot;, while the spacecraft was originally thought to have re-entered over the Pacific Ocean, it was subsequently (inÂ 1963) found to have re-entered over Siberia, when this medal made its way back to Chertok by way of his boss, Chief Rocket Designer Sergei Korolev. He relates that &quot;while swimming in a river â a tributary of the Biryusa River in eastern Siberia â a local boy hurt his foot on some sort of piece of iron. When he retrieved it from the water, rather than throw it into deeper water, he brought it home and showed it to his father. The boyâs father, curious as to what the dented metal sphere contained, opened it up and discovered this medal insideâ¦ The boyâs father brought his find to the police. The local police delivered the remains of the pendant to the regional department of the KGB, which in turn forwarded it to Moscow. In Moscow the appropriate KGB directorateâ¦ after notifying Keldysh as president of the Academy of Sciences&quot;, delivered the pendant to Korolev. &quot;Thus, [Chertok] was awarded the medal that had been certified for the flight to Venus by the protocol that [he and Korolev] signed in January 1961. After the launch we were all certain that the Tyazhely Sputnik and the pendant had sunk in the ocean. Now it turned out that it had burned up over Siberia. The pendant had been designed to withstand Venus&#x27; atmosphere and therefore it reached the Earthâs surface.&quot;

The sister probe, Venera 1, successfully launched and was injected into a heliocentric orbit toward Venus one week later, although telemetry on the mission failed a week into flight.

<text>Sir Peter Neville Luard Pears ( ; 22 June 19103 April 1986) was an English tenor. His career was closely associated with the composer Benjamin Britten, his personal and professional partner for nearly forty years.

Pears&#x27; musical career started slowly. He was at first unsure whether to concentrate on playing piano and organ, or singing; it was not until he met Britten in 1937 that he threw himself wholeheartedly into singing. Once he and Britten were established as a partnership, the composer wrote many concert and operatic works with Pears&#x27;s voice in mind, and the singer played roles in more than ten operas by Britten. In the concert hall, Pears and Britten were celebrated recitalists, known in particular for their performances of lieder by Schubert and Schumann. Together they recorded most of the works written for Pears by Britten, as well as a wide range of music by other composers. Working with other musicians, Pears sang an extensive repertoire of music from four centuries, from the Tudor period to the most modern times.

With Britten, Pears was a co-founder of the Aldeburgh Festival in 1947 and the Britten-Pears School in 1972. After Britten died in 1976, Pears remained an active participant in the festival and the school, where he was director of singing. His voice had a distinctive timbre, not to all tastes; however, he could use his voice very well in singing many musical styles.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Pears was born in Farnham, Surrey, the youngest of the seven children of Arthur Grant Pears and his wife, Jessie Elizabeth de Visme, daughter of Richard Luard. Arthur Pears was a civil engineer and successful businessman, who spent much of his time working overseas. The biographers Christopher Headington and Donald Mitchell both remark on two contrasting strands in Pears&#x27;s heredity: the Luard family was notable for its naval and military connections, and on his father&#x27;s side there was a strong religious tradition, both Anglican and Quaker, with Elizabeth Fry counted among his ancestors. Mitchell comments that Pears&#x27;s lifelong pacifism stemmed from the Quaker side of the family, and adds, &quot;There was indeed something of the patrician Quaker in his looks, manners, and deeds. His habitual charm and courtesy rarely deserted him.&quot;

Although his father, and sometimes his mother, were absent abroad for long periods, Pears evidently had a happy childhood. He enjoyed his schooldays at his prep school, The Grange, and his public school, Lancing College, which he attended from 1923 to 1928. He showed considerable talent for music, both as a pianist and as a singer, playing leading roles in school productions of Gilbert and Sullivan operas. He was a capable and enthusiastic cricketer, and remembered all his life the pride he felt in scoring 81 not out in a trial match against Surrey at the Oval. Lancing had a strong Christian tradition; while there, Pears felt a sense of vocation for the priesthood, but increasingly found this impossible to reconcile with his growing awareness of his homosexuality.

In 1928 Pears went to Keble College, Oxford, to study music. He was not at this stage sure whether his musical future was as a singer or as player; during his brief time at the university, he was appointed temporary assistant organist at Hertford College, which was useful practical experience. Headington comments that a musical conservatoire such as the Royal College of Music would have suited Pears better than the Oxford course, but at the time it was seen as a natural progression for an English public school boy to continue his education at Oxford or Cambridge. In the event Pears did not take to Oxford&#x27;s academic regime, which required him to study a range of subjects before specialising in music. He failed the first-year examinations (Moderations) and though he was entitled to resit them he decided against doing so, and went down from Oxford.

===Teacher and singer===
With no clear idea of his future, Pears took a teaching post at his old preparatory school in 1929. Among his dearest friends were the twins Peter Burra and Nell Burra; Peter was a close friend from Lancing days, and Nell looked on Pears as almost another brother. She urged him not to drift into a lifetime of schoolmastering, and he concluded that his future lay in singing. He later said that it was hearing the tenor Steuart Wilson (a distant cousin) singing the Evangelist in J S Bach&#x27;s &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot; that &quot;started me off&quot;. He successfully applied for admission to the Royal College of Music in London, first as a part-time student and then, having been awarded a scholarship, studying full-time from 1934. He shared an apartment with Trevor Harvey and Basil Douglas. He appeared in student productions of opera, finding himself wholly at home on the stage, and learning from the experience of singing Delius under Sir Thomas Beecham and roles in works by Mozart and Puccini. But, as at Oxford, he failed to complete the course. He chafed at subsisting on a student&#x27;s limited funds, and wanted a good, steady income. He auditioned for the BBC and was given a two-year contract as a member of the BBC Singers, a small vocal ensemble.

In 1936 Pears made his first recording as a soloist, in Peter Warlock&#x27;s &quot;Corpus Christi Carol&quot;. Headington comments on &quot;a thoughtful word delivery and a sensitive moulding of quietly flowing phrases, but also a certain whiteness of tone ... a kind of English cathedral sound.&quot; In the same year, after Peter Burra was given a long-term loan of a cottage on Bucklebury Common, Berkshire, Pears began to stay with him regularly, and it was through Burra that he got to be friendly with the rising young composer Benjamin Britten, who had become another good friend of Burra&#x27;s. In 1937 Burra was killed in an air crash. Pears and Britten volunteered to clear his possessions from the cottage, and their daily contact during this period cemented their friendship. Pears quickly became Britten&#x27;s musical inspiration and close (though for the moment platonic) friend. Britten&#x27;s first work for him was composed within weeks of their meeting, a setting of Emily BrontÃ«&#x27;s poem, &quot;A thousand gleaming fires&quot;, for tenor and strings.

Up to this point Pears had not pursued his career or his vocal training with any great determination. With the stimulus of Britten&#x27;s music written for him he became much more focused. After their deaths John Amis wrote that Britten would have become a great composer without Pears, but that Pears would probably not have become a great singer without Britten. Pears took vocal lessons from the eminent Lieder singer Elena Gerhardt, but they were of limited help to him, and it was some time before he found a wholly suitable voice coach. In 1938 he had his first professional experience of opera, as an understudy and member of the chorus at Glyndebourne.

===America and wartime===

In April 1939, Pears accompanied Britten as he sailed to North America, going first to Canada and then to New York. Their relationship ceased to be platonic, and from then until Britten&#x27;s death they were partners in both their professional and personal lives. When the Second World War began, Britten and Pears turned for advice to the British embassy in Washington and were told that they should remain in the US as artistic ambassadors. Pears was inclined to disregard the advice and go back to England; Britten also felt the urge to return, but accepted the embassy&#x27;s counsel and persuaded Pears to do the same.

In 1940 Britten composed &quot;Seven Sonnets of Michelangelo&quot;, the first of many song cycles for Pears. The composer and biographer David Matthews described the cycle as Britten&#x27;s &quot;declaration of love for Peter&quot;. The partners made a private recording of the work in New York shortly after it was completed, but the public premiere was not for a further two years. In 1941, spurred by a magazine article by E M Forster about the Suffolk poet George Crabbe, Pears bought Britten a copy of Crabbe&#x27;s collection of narrative poems &quot;The Borough&quot;. He suggested to Britten that the section about the fisherman Peter Grimes would make a good subject for an opera. Britten agreed, and, a Suffolk man himself, was struck with a deep nostalgia by the poem. He later said, &quot;I suddenly realised where I belonged and what I lacked&quot;. He and Pears began to plan their return to England. They made the perilous Atlantic crossing in April 1942.

Having arrived in England, Britten and Pears successfully applied for official recognition as conscientious objectors, Pears&#x27;s application running much more smoothly than Britten&#x27;s. One of their early performances together after their return was the public premiere of the Michelangelo cycle at the Wigmore Hall in September 1942. Their recording of the work for HMV was released in February 1943. Britten was by now so obsessed with the sound of Pears&#x27;s &quot;heavenly voice&quot; that he went out of his way to discourage sopranos from singing his earlier song cycle, &quot;Les Illuminations&quot;, though it had been specifically composed for the soprano voice. For Pears, Britten composed one of his most popular works, the Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings (1943).

In early 1943 Pears joined Sadler&#x27;s Wells Opera Company. His roles included Tamino in &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, Rodolfo in &quot;La bohÃ¨me&quot;, the Duke in &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, Alfredo in &quot;La traviata&quot;, Almaviva in &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;, Ferrando in &quot;CosÃ¬ fan tutte&quot; and VaÅ¡ek in &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot;. His growing operatic experience and expertise affected the composition of Britten&#x27;s opera &quot;Peter Grimes&quot;. The composer had envisaged the central figure, based on Crabbe&#x27;s brutal fisherman, as a villainous baritone, but he began to rethink the character as &quot;neither a hero nor a villain&quot; and not a baritone but a tenor, written to fit Pears&#x27;s voice. In January 1944 Britten and Pears began a long association with the Decca Record Company, recording four of Britten&#x27;s folk song arrangements. In May of the same year, with Dennis Brain and the Boyd Neel Orchestra, they recorded the Serenade.

===&quot;Peter Grimes&quot; and English Opera Group===
As the war was nearing its end, the artistic director of Sadler&#x27;s Wells, the singer Joan Cross, announced her intention to re-open the company&#x27;s home base in London with Britten&#x27;s new opera &quot;Peter Grimes&quot;, casting herself and Pears in the leading roles. There were complaints from company members about supposed favouritism and the &quot;cacophony&quot; of Britten&#x27;s score, as well as some ill-suppressed homophobic remarks. &quot;Peter Grimes&quot; opened in June 1945 and was hailed by public and critics. Most of the extensive press coverage was to do with the work, but there was also high praise for the performances of Pears and Cross. Dismayed by the in-fighting among the company, Cross, Britten and Pears severed their ties with Sadler&#x27;s Wells in December 1945, going on to found what was to become the English Opera Group.

Britten&#x27;s next opera, &quot;The Rape of Lucretia&quot;, was presented at the first post-war Glyndebourne Festival, in 1946. It was a chamber piece for eight singers and an orchestra of twelve players. Pears and Cross were the Male and Female Chorus, with Kathleen Ferrier as Lucretia. After the festival, the work was taken on tour to provincial cities under the banner of the &quot;Glyndebourne English Opera Company&quot;, an uneasy alliance of Britten and his associates with John Christie, the autocratic proprietor of Glyndebourne. The tour lost money heavily, and Christie announced that he would underwrite no more tours. Britten and his associates set up the English Opera Group; the librettist Eric Crozier and the designer John Piper joined Britten as artistic directors. The group&#x27;s express purpose was to produce and commission new English operas and other works, presenting them throughout the country. Britten wrote the comic opera &quot;Albert Herring&quot; for the group in 1947. Pears played the title role â one of his fairly rare excursions into comedy. Reviews of the opera were mixed, but Pears&#x27;s performance as Albert, the mother&#x27;s boy who kicks over the traces, received consistently good notices.

===Aldeburgh===
While on tour as Albert, Pears came up with the idea of mounting a festival in the small Suffolk seaside town of Aldeburgh. Britten had bought a house there, and the town was his principal residence for the rest of his life. The Aldeburgh Festival was launched in June 1948, with Britten, Pears and Crozier directing it. For the inaugural festival, &quot;Albert Herring&quot; played at the Jubilee Hall, and Britten&#x27;s new cantata &quot;Saint Nicolas&quot;, was presented in the parish church, with Pears as the tenor soloist. The festival was an immediate success and became an annual event that has continued into the 21st century.

New works by Britten featured in almost every festival until his death in 1976. They included operas in which leading roles were created by Pears, and written with his voice in mind. They ranged from the comic (Flute in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, 1960) to the deeply serious (Aschenbach in &quot;Death in Venice&quot;, 1973). His other creations at Aldeburgh included the Madwoman in &quot;Curlew River&quot; (1964), Nebuchadnezzar in &quot;The Burning Fiery Furnace&quot; (1966) and the Tempter in &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot; (1968).

For the English Opera Group during the 1950s, Pears also sang Macheath in Britten&#x27;s radically revised version of &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;, SatyavÄn in Holst&#x27;s &quot;SÄvitri&quot;, and the title role in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Idomeneo&quot;. At Covent Garden he created roles in operas by Britten and Walton: Vere in &quot;Billy Budd&quot; (1951), Essex in &quot;Gloriana&quot; (1953), and Pandarus in &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; (1954). Among his roles in older operas were Tamino, VaÅ¡ek, and David in &quot;Die Meistersinger von NÃ¼rnberg&quot;.

Throughout the 1940s and 1950s Pears continually expanded his recital and concert repertoire. He sang his first Gerontius in 1944, and the tenor part in &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot; in the same year. From the late 1940s he gained an international reputation as the Evangelist in the &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot;. The music critic David Cairns wrote, &quot;Pears&#x27;s interpretation of the evangelist&#x27;s part in the Bach Passions seemed complete as no other singer&#x27;s: it encompassed every turn in the drama, the pity, the anger, the despair, the resignation.&quot; In Lieder by Schubert, Schumann and others he was almost always accompanied by Britten, a partnership that Headington calls &quot;as nearly an artistic unity as could be imagined&quot;; Cairns calls their Lieder performances &quot;never to be forgotten&quot;. They made recordings for Decca of &quot;Die schÃ¶ne MÃ¼llerin&quot;, &quot;Winterreise&quot; and &quot;Dichterliebe&quot; that have remained in print since their first issue in the 1960s.

===Later years===
Among the highlights of Pears&#x27;s career in the 1960s was the premiere of Britten&#x27;s &quot;War Requiem&quot; in May 1962, marking the consecration of the new Coventry Cathedral. Britten composed it with the voices of Pears, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Galina Vishnevskaya in mind. The Soviet authorities prevented Vishnevskaya from taking part (Heather Harper deputised) but in January 1963 all three intended soloists took part in a Decca recording conducted by Britten, which unexpectedly became a best-seller. As well as his performing partnership with Britten, Pears established another with Julian Bream, who, as a lutenist, accompanied him in many works, most notably those of English composers of the Tudor period.

Pears and Britten maintained an arduous international touring schedule, and made many broadcasts and gramophone recordings. In the 1970s Pears created roles in Britten&#x27;s last two operas, playing General Wingrave in &quot;Owen Wingrave&quot; recorded at Aldeburgh for its premiere, which was on BBC television, and Aschenbach in &quot;Death in Venice&quot; (1973). It was in the latter role that Pears made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera, New York, at the age of 64.

After Britten&#x27;s death in 1976, Pears had the good fortune to find another accompanist with whom he could collaborate fruitfully. With Murray Perahia, Pears gave performances of such works as Britten&#x27;s &quot;Michelangelo Sonnets&quot; and Schumann&#x27;s &quot;Liederkreis&quot; to critical acclaim. He continued to perform until a stroke ended his singing career in 1980 shortly after the celebrations marking his seventieth birthday. After that he remained an active director of the Aldeburgh Festival, and taught at the Britten-Pears School which he and his partner had set up in 1972.

Pears died in Aldeburgh on 3 April 1986 at the age of 75. He was buried beside Britten in the churchyard of the parish church of St Peter and St Paul, Aldeburgh.

==Voice==
Pears&#x27;s voice was both unmistakable and controversial. Some music-lovers found his characteristic timbre uncongenial. The critic Alan Blyth described it thus: 

David Cairns broadly concurred, writing:
==Honours and awards==
Pears was awarded honorary degrees or fellowships by three music academies and nine universities in the UK and US. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1957, and knighted in 1978. Other awards included the Queen&#x27;s Jubilee Medal, 1977, Musician of the Year, Incorporated Society of Musicians, 1978, and the Royal Opera House&#x27;s Long Service Medal, 1979.

==Recordings==
For Decca, Pears recorded almost all the music written for him by Britten. The major exception is the role of the Earl of Essex in &quot;Gloriana&quot;, which was not recorded until after Britten and Pears were dead. Pears&#x27;s other Decca recordings range from early music by Dowland, SchÃ¼tz and their contemporaries to Walton&#x27;s &quot;FaÃ§ade&quot;, and include such varied repertory as the Emperor in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Turandot&quot;, the title role in Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;, and the tenor part in Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;enfance du Christ.&quot; His recordings for other companies include the role of the Evangelist in Bach&#x27;s &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot; (Otto Klemperer&#x27;s 1961 EMI version), the tenor part in the same composer&#x27;s Mass in B minor and FaurÃ©&#x27;s &quot;La bonne chanson&quot;.

<text>Venera 1 ( meaning &quot;Venus 1&quot;), also known as Venera-1VA No.2 and occasionally in the West as Sputnik 8 was the first spacecraft to perform an interplanetary flight and the first to fly past Venus, as part of the Soviet Union&#x27;s Venera programme. Launched in February 1961, it flew past Venus on 19 May of the same year; however, radio contact with the probe was lost before the flyby, resulting in it returning no data.

==Spacecraft==
&quot;Venera 1&quot; was a probe consisting of a cylindrical body in diameter topped by a dome, totalling in height. This was pressurized to with dry nitrogen, with internal fans to maintain even distribution of heat. Two solar panels extended from the cylinder, charging a bank of silver-zinc batteries. A parabolic wire-mesh antenna was designed to send data from Venus to Earth on a frequency of 922.8Â MHz. A antenna boom was used to transmit short-wave signals during the near-Earth phase of the mission. Semidirectional quadrupole antennas mounted on the solar panels provided routine telemetry and telecommand contact with Earth during the mission, on a circularly-polarized decimetre radio band.

The probe was equipped with scientific instruments including a flux-gate magnetometer attached to the antenna boom, two ion traps to measure solar wind, micrometeorite detectors, and Geiger counter tubes and a sodium iodide scintillator for measurement of cosmic radiation. An experiment attached to one solar panel measured temperatures of experimental coatings. Infrared and/or ultraviolet radiometers may have been included. The dome contained a KDU-414 engine used for mid-course corrections. Temperature control was achieved by motorized thermal shutters.

During most of its flight, &quot;Venera 1&quot; was spin stabilized. It was the first spacecraft designed to perform mid-course corrections, by entering a mode of 3-axis stabilization, fixing on the Sun and the star Canopus. Had it reached Venus, it would have entered another mode of 3-axis stabilization, fixing on the Sun and Earth, and using for the first time a parabolic antenna to relay data.

==Launch==

&quot;Venera 1&quot; was the second of two attempts to launch a probe to Venus in February 1961, immediately following the launch of its sister ship &quot;Venera-1VA No.1&quot;, which failed to leave Earth orbit due to the failure of a power transformer. The transformer was wrapped in foil and painted black and white for thermal reasons. Soviet experts launched Venera-1 using a Molniya carrier rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome. The launch took place at 00:34:36 GMT on 12 February 1961. Vehicle L1-6V steered downrange into a clear blue winter sky and orbit was successfully achieved.

The spacecraft, along with the rocket&#x27;s Blok-L upper stage, was initially placed into a low Earth orbit, before the upper stage fired to place &quot;Venera 1&quot; into a heliocentric orbit, directed towards Venus. The 11D33 engine was the world&#x27;s first staged-combustion-cycle rocket engine, and also the first use of an ullage engine to allow a liquid-fuel rocket engine to start in space.

==Failure==
During the first telemetry session, it was found that Venera 1 failed to enter the constant solar orientation mode, which led to a shortage of electrical power on board. While unfortunate, this was expected and in such a case the station had to conduct a rough orientation to the Sun and turn off non-vital systems. However, the radio transmitters had not been adequately designed and communication was shortly lost. The signal was regained on 17 February but it was still unable to lock onto the Sun properly and again went into protective mode and turned off the transmitter. Three successful telemetry sessions were conducted, gathering solar-wind and cosmic-ray data near Earth, at the Earth&#x27;s Magnetopause, and on February 19 at a distance of . After discovering the solar wind with &quot;Luna 2&quot;, &quot;Venera 1&quot; provided the first verification that this plasma was uniformly present in deep space. Seven days later, the next scheduled telemetry session failed to occur. On May 19, 1961, &quot;Venera 1&quot; passed within of Venus. With the help of the British radio telescope at Jodrell Bank, some weak signals from &quot;Venera 1&quot; may have been detected in June. Soviet engineers believed that &quot;Venera 1&quot; failed due to the overheating of a solar-direction sensor.

<text>Ranger 1 was a prototype spacecraft launched as part of the Ranger program of uncrewed space missions. Its primary mission was to test the performance of those functions and parts necessary for carrying out subsequent lunar and planetary missions; a secondary objective was to study the nature of particles and fields in the space environment. Due to a launch vehicle malfunction, the spacecraft could reach only Low Earth orbit, rather than the high Earth orbit that had been planned, and was only able to complete part of its mission.

== Spacecraft design ==

The spacecraft was of the Ranger Block I design and consisted of a hexagonal base across upon which was mounted a cone-shaped high tower of aluminum struts and braces. Two solar panel wings measuring from tip to tip extended from the base. A high-gain directional dish antenna was attached to the bottom of the base. Spacecraft experiments and other equipment were mounted on the base and tower. Instruments aboard the spacecraft included a Lyman-alpha telescope, a rubidium-vapor magnetometer, electrostatic analyzers, medium-energy range particle detectors, two triple coincidence telescopes, a cosmic-ray integrating ionization chamber, cosmic dust detectors, and solar X-ray scintillation counters. There was no camera or midcourse correction engine on the Block I spacecraft.

The communications system included the high-gain antenna and an omnidirectional medium-gain antenna and two transmitters, one at 960.1 MHz with 0.25Â watts power output and the other at 960.05Â MHz with 3Â watts power output. Power was to be furnished by 8680 solar cells on the two panels, a silver-zinc battery, and smaller batteries on some of the experiments. Attitude control was provided by a solid-state timing controller, Sun and Earth sensors, and pitch and roll jets. The temperature was controlled passively by gold plating, white paint, and polished aluminum surfaces.

== Mission ==
The Ranger 1 spacecraft was designed to go into an Earth parking orbit and then move into a Earth orbit. The purpose of the mission was mainly as an engineering test to verify the functionality of the Ranger hardware.

=== Launch delays ===
* Delay of the 1st countdown
** July 26: Trajectory information required by the Range Safety Officer was delayed.
** July 27: A guidance system malfunction in the Atlas booster.
** July 28: Engineers found that the guidance program to be fed into the Cape computer contained an error.
* 1st countdown. July 29.
** 83 minutes before launch: Power interruptions occurred, requiring momentary holds to permit all stations to check and recover.
** 28 minutes before launch: Commercial electrical power failed. Inadequate allowance had been made for changes in cable sag caused by variations in temperature on the new power poles recently installed at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.
* 2nd countdown. July 30. Engineers discovered a leak in Ranger&#x27;s attitude control gas system.
* 3rd countdown. July 31. A LOX tank pressure regulator seal developed a leak due to damage resulting from improper handling.
* 4th countdown. August 1. Ground controllers turned on a spacecraft command applying high voltage to the scientific experiments for calibration purposes. Immediately all stations reported a major spacecraft failure. An electrical malfunction had triggered multiple commands from the central clock timer, and Ranger 1 &quot;turned on&quot; as it had been programmed to do in orbit. The explosive squibs fired, solar panels extended inside the shroud, and all the experiments commenced to operate. Project engineers disengaged Ranger 1 from the Agena and hastily returned it to Hangar AE. Meantime, the launch was rescheduled for August 22, the next available opportunity. Subsequent tests and investigations determined the activating mechanism to have been a voltage discharge to the spacecraft frame; although engineers suspected one or two of the scientific instruments, they could not determine the precise source of the discharge with certainty. In the days that followed, they replaced and requalified the damaged parts and modified the circuitry to prevent a recurrence of this kind of failure.

=== Launch ===
During the first half of 1961, Lockheed introduced the new Agena B stage which replaced the early test-model Agena A of 1959-60. Agena B was more powerful and had in-orbit restart capability. Its first flight with the launch of Midas 3 on July 24 was successful. Several frustrating delays in Ranger 1&#x27;s launch occurred, including one episode where the spacecraft&#x27;s timer inadvertently activated on the pad, causing the solar panels to be deployed inside the payload shroud. After removing Ranger 1 and repairing it, the launch was carried out at 6:04 AM EST on August 23. All went well up to orbital injection, but the planned Agena restart went awry when the engine shut down after only a few seconds, putting the probe in a 312x105 mile track. Subsequent investigation concluded that an electrical circuit in the Agena had overheated from exposure to the Sun. The unintended orbit made it difficult to operate Ranger 1&#x27;s systems correctly, although ground controllers tried to work around it. The main problem they faced was with the solar panels; Ranger 1 would experience 90 minutes of darkness while passing around the nighttime side of the Earth. In addition, the antennas at NASA&#x27;s various tracking stations had difficulty locking onto the probe due to its orbital plane. During this time, the computer system repeatedly fired the attitude control jets in a vain attempt to lock onto the Sun with the effect that only one day after launch, the probe ran out of attitude control gas. At this point, it could not be stabilized and the solar panels lost their lock on the Sun. Ranger 1 thus reverted to battery power and continued transmitting until the batteries ran down on August 27 and all signals from the probe ceased. It was not a total loss; the spacecraft systems had worked well and some data on cosmic rays and radiation was returned, however the low orbit precluded the use of the magnetometer. After four days and 111 orbits, Ranger 1 reentered and burned up over the Gulf of Mexico.

<text>The Boston Massacre, known in Great Britain as the Incident on King Street, was a confrontation, on March 5, 1770, during the American Revolution in Boston in what was then colonial-era Province of Massachusetts Bay. 

In the confrontation, nine British soldiers shot several in a crowd estimated between 300 and 400, who were harassing them verbally and throwing various projectiles. The event was subsequently described &quot;a massacre&quot; by Samuel Adams, Paul Revere, and other leading Patriots who later became central proponents of independence during the American Revolution and Revolutionary War. British troops had been stationed in the Province of Massachusetts Bay since 1768 in order to support Crown-appointed officials and to enforce unpopular legislation implemented by the British Parliament

Amid tense relations between the civilians and the soldiers, a mob formed around a British sentry and verbally abused him. He was eventually supported by seven additional soldiers, led by Captain Thomas Preston, who were hit by clubs, stones, and snowballs. Eventually, one soldier fired, prompting the others to fire without an order by Preston. The gunfire instantly killed three people and wounded eight others, two of whom later died of their wounds.

The crowd eventually dispersed after acting governor Thomas Hutchinson promised an inquiry, but they reformed the next day, prompting the withdrawal of the troops to Castle Island. Eight soldiers, one officer, and four civilians were arrested and charged with murder, and they were defended in court by attorney, and future U.S. president, John Adams. Six of the soldiers were acquitted; the other two were convicted of manslaughter and given reduced sentences. The two found guilty of manslaughter were sentenced to branding on their hand.

Depictions, reports, and propaganda about the event heightened tensions throughout the Thirteen Colonies, notably the colored engraving produced by Paul Revere.

==Background==
In the 18th century, Boston was the capital of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, an important shipping town, and along with Philadelphia and present-day New York City, one of the most influential political, economic, and cultural cities in the Thirteen Colonies of pre-Revolutionary British America. Boston also was a center of resistance to unpopular acts of taxation by the British Parliament in the 1760s.

In 1768, the Townshend Acts were enacted in the Thirteen Colonies, placing tariffs on a variety of common items that were manufactured in Britain and imported in the colonies. Colonists objected that the Acts were a violation of the natural, charter, and constitutional rights of British subjects in the colonies. The Massachusetts House of Representatives began a campaign against the Acts by sending a petition to King George III asking for the repeal of the Townshend Revenue Act. The House also sent the Massachusetts Circular Letter to other colonial assemblies, asking them to join the resistance movement, and called for a boycott of merchants importing the affected goods.

Lord Hillsborough had recently been appointed to the newly created office of Colonial Secretary, and he was alarmed by the actions of the Massachusetts House. In April 1768, he sent a letter to the colonial governors in America instructing them to dissolve any colonial assemblies that responded to the Massachusetts Circular Letter. He also ordered Massachusetts Governor Francis Bernard to direct the Massachusetts House to rescind the letter. The house refused to comply.

Boston&#x27;s chief customs officer Charles Paxton wrote to Hillsborough for military support because &quot;the Government is as much in the hands of the people as it was in the time of the Stamp Act.&quot; Commodore Samuel Hood responded by sending the 50-gun warship , which arrived in Boston Harbor in May 1768. On June 10, 1768, customs officials seized &quot;Liberty&quot;, a sloop owned by leading Boston merchant John Hancock, on allegations that the ship had been involved in smuggling. Bostonians were already angry because the captain of &quot;Romney&quot; had been impressing local sailors; they began to riot, and customs officials fled to Castle William for protection.

Given the unstable state of affairs in Massachusetts, Hillsborough instructed General Thomas Gage, Commander-in-Chief, North America, to send &quot;such Force as You shall think necessary to Boston&quot;, and the first of four British Army regiments began disembarking in Boston on October 1, 1768. Two regiments were removed from Boston in 1769, but the 14th and the 29th Regiments of Foot remained.

The &quot;Journal of Occurrences&quot; were an anonymous series of newspaper articles which chronicled the clashes between civilians and soldiers in Boston, feeding tensions with its sometimes exaggerated accounts, but those tensions rose markedly after Christopher Seider, &quot;a young lad about eleven Years of Age&quot;, was killed by a customs employee on February 22, 1770. Seider&#x27;s death was covered in the &quot;Boston Gazette&quot;, and his funeral was described as one of the largest of the time in Boston. The killing and subsequent media coverage inflamed tensions, with groups of colonists looking for soldiers to harass, and soldiers also looking for confrontation.

==Incident==

On the evening of March 5, Private Hugh White stood on guard duty outside the Boston Custom House on King Street (today known as State Street). A wigmaker&#x27;s apprentice, approximately 13 years old, named Edward Garrick called out to Captain-Lieutenant John Goldfinch, accusing him of refusing to pay a bill due to Garrick&#x27;s master. Goldfinch had settled the account the previous day, and ignored the insult. Private White called out to Garrick that he should be more respectful of the officer, and the two exchanged insults. Garrick then started poking Goldfinch in the chest with his finger; White left his post, challenged the boy, and struck him on the side of the head with his musket. Garrick cried out in pain, and his companion Bartholomew Broaders began to argue with White, which attracted a larger crowd. Henry Knox was a 19-year old bookseller who later served as a general in the revolution; he came upon the scene and warned White that, &quot;if he fired, he must die for it.&quot;

As the evening progressed, the crowd around Private White grew larger and more boisterous. Church bells were rung, which usually signified a fire, bringing more people out. More than 50 Bostonians pressed around White, led by a mixed-race former slave named Crispus Attucks, throwing objects at the sentry and challenging him to fire his weapon. White had taken up a somewhat safer position on the steps of the Custom House, and he sought assistance. Runners alerted Captain Thomas Preston, the officer of the watch at the nearby barracks. According to his report, Preston dispatched a non-commissioned officer and six privates from the grenadier company of the 29th Regiment of Foot to relieve White with fixed bayonets. The soldiers were Corporal William Wemms and Privates Hugh Montgomery, John Carroll, William McCauley, William Warren, and Matthew Kilroy, accompanied by Preston. They pushed their way through the crowd. Henry Knox took Preston by the coat and told him, &quot;For God&#x27;s sake, take care of your men. If they fire, you must die.&quot; Captain Preston responded &quot;I am aware of it.&quot; When they reached Private White on the custom house stairs, the soldiers loaded their muskets and arrayed themselves in a semicircular formation. Preston shouted at the crowd, estimated between 300 and 400, to disperse.

The crowd continued to press around the soldiers, taunting them by yelling &quot;Fire!&quot;, by spitting at them, and by throwing snowballs and other small objects. Innkeeper Richard Palmes was carrying a cudgel, and he came up to Preston and asked if the soldiers&#x27; weapons were loaded. Preston assured him that they were, but that they would not fire unless he ordered it; he later stated in his deposition that he was unlikely to do so, since he was standing in front of them. A thrown object then struck Private Montgomery, knocking him down and causing him to drop his musket. He recovered his weapon and angrily shouted &quot;Damn you, fire!&quot;, then discharged it into the crowd although no command was given. Palmes swung his cudgel first at Montgomery, hitting his arm, and then at Preston. He narrowly missed Preston&#x27;s head, striking him on the arm instead.

There was a pause of uncertain length (eyewitness estimates ranged from several seconds to two minutes), after which the soldiers fired into the crowd. It was not a disciplined volley, since Preston gave no orders to fire; the soldiers fired a ragged series of shots which hit 11 men. Three Americans died instantly: rope maker Samuel Gray, mariner James Caldwell, and Crispus Attucks. Samuel Maverick, a 17-year old apprentice ivory turner, was struck by a ricocheting musket ball at the back of the crowd and died early the next morning. Irish immigrant Patrick Carr was shot in the abdomen, an inevitably fatal wound at that time, and died two weeks later. Apprentice Christopher Monk was seriously wounded; he was crippled and died in 1780, purportedly due to the injuries that he had sustained in the attack a decade earlier.

The crowd moved away from the immediate area of the custom house but continued to grow in nearby streets. Captain Preston immediately called out most of the 29th Regiment, which adopted defensive positions in front of the state house. Acting Governor Thomas Hutchinson was summoned to the scene and was forced by the movement of the crowd into the council chamber of the state house. From its balcony, he was able to minimally restore order, promising that there would be a fair inquiry into the shootings if the crowd dispersed.

==Aftermath==

===Investigation===
Hutchinson immediately began investigating the affair, and Preston and the eight soldiers were arrested by the next morning. Boston&#x27;s selectmen then asked him to order the troops to move from the city out to Castle William on Castle Island, while colonists held a town meeting at Faneuil Hall to discuss the affair. The governor&#x27;s council was initially opposed to ordering the troop withdrawal, and Hutchinson explained he did not have the authority to &quot;order&quot; the troops to move. Lieutenant Colonel William Dalrymple was the commander of the troops, and he did not offer to move them. The town meeting became more restive when it learned of this; the council changed its position and unanimously (&quot;under duress&quot;, according to Hutchinson&#x27;s report) agreed to request the troops&#x27; removal. Secretary of State Andrew Oliver reported that, had the troops not been removed, &quot;they would probably be destroyed by the peopleâshould it be called rebellion, should it incur the loss of our charter, or be the consequence what it would.&quot; The 14th was transferred to Castle Island without incident about a week later, with the 29th following shortly after, leaving the governor without effective means to police the town. The first four victims were buried with ceremony on March 8 in the Granary Burying Ground, one of Boston&#x27;s oldest burial grounds. Patrick Carr, the fifth and final victim, died on March 14 and was buried with them on March 17.

On March 27, the eight soldiers, Captain Preston, and four civilians were indicted for murder; the civilians were in the Customs House and were alleged to have fired shots. Bostonians continued to be hostile to the troops and their dependents. General Gage was convinced that the troops were doing more harm than good, so he ordered the 29th Regiment out of the province in May. Governor Hutchinson took advantage of the on-going high tensions to orchestrate delays of the trials until later in the year.

===Media battle===

In the days and weeks following the incident, a propaganda battle was waged between Patriots and Loyalists in Boston. Both sides published pamphlets that told strikingly different stories, and which were principally published in London in a bid to influence opinion there. The &quot;Boston Gazette&quot; version of events, for example, characterized the massacre as part of an ongoing scheme to &quot;quell a Spirit of Liberty&quot;, and harped on the negative consequences of quartering troops in the city.

Henry Pelham was an engraver and half-brother of celebrated portrait painter John Singleton Copley, and he depicted the event in an engraving. Silversmith and engraver Paul Revere closely copied the image and is often credited as its originator. The engraving contained several inflammatory details. Captain Preston is shown ordering his men to fire, and a musket is seen shooting out of the window of the customs office, which is labeled &quot;Butcher&#x27;s Hall&quot;. Artist Christian Remick hand-colored some prints. Some copies of the print show a man with two chest wounds and a somewhat darker face, matching descriptions of Attucks; others show no black victim. The image was published in the &quot;Boston Gazette&quot; and circulated widely, and it became an effective anti-British editorial. The image of soldiers in red uniforms and wounded men with red blood was hung in farmhouses throughout New England.

Anonymous pamphlets were published describing the event from significantly different perspectives. &quot;A Short Narrative of the Horrid Massacre&quot; was published under the auspices of the Boston town meeting, principally written by James Bowdoin, a member of the governor&#x27;s council and a vocal opponent of British colonial policy, along with Samuel Pemberton and Joseph Warren. It described the shooting and other lesser incidents that took place in the days before as unprovoked attacks on peaceful, law-abiding inhabitants and, according to historian Neal Langley York, was probably the most influential description of the event. The account which it provided was drawn from more than 90 depositions taken after the event, and it included accusations that the soldiers sent by Captain Preston had been deployed with the intention of causing harm. In the interest of minimizing impact on the jury pool, city leaders held back local distribution of the pamphlet, but they sent copies to other colonies and to London, where they knew that depositions were headed which Governor Hutchinson had collected. A second pamphlet entitled &quot;Additional Observations&quot; on the &quot;Short Narrative&quot; furthered the attack on crown officials by complaining that customs officials were abandoning their posts under the pretense that it was too dangerous for them to do their duties; one customs official had left Boston to carry Hutchinson&#x27;s gathered depositions to London.

Hutchinson&#x27;s depositions were eventually published in a pamphlet entitled &quot;A Fair Account of the Late Unhappy Disturbance in Boston&quot;, drawn mainly from the depositions of soldiers. Its account of affairs sought to blame Bostonians for denying the validity of Parliamentary laws. It also blamed the city&#x27;s citizens for the lawlessness preceding the event, and claimed that they set up an ambush of the soldiers. As it was not published until well after the first pamphlet had arrived in London, it had a much smaller impact on the public debate there.

===Trials===


The government was determined to give the soldiers a fair trial so that there could be no grounds for retaliation from the British and so that moderates would not be alienated from the Patriot cause. Several lawyers refused to defend Preston due to their Loyalist leanings, so he sent a request to John Adams, pleading for him to work on the case. Adams was already a leading Patriot and was contemplating a run for public office, but he agreed to help in the interest of ensuring a fair trial. He was joined by Josiah Quincy II after Quincy was assured that the Sons of Liberty would not oppose his appointment, and by Loyalist Robert Auchmuty. They were assisted by Sampson Salter Blowers, whose chief duty was to investigate the jury pool, and by Paul Revere, who drew a detailed map of the bodies to be used in the trial. Massachusetts Solicitor General Samuel Quincy and private attorney Robert Treat Paine were hired by the town of Boston to handle the prosecution. The defense team believed it was advantageous for Preston and the enlisted men to be tried separately and obtained such a separation. Preston was tried in late October 1770 and acquitted after the jury was convinced that he had not ordered the troops to fire.

The trial of the eight other soldiers opened on November 27, 1770. Adams told the jury to look beyond the fact that the soldiers were British. He referred to the crowd that had provoked the soldiers as &quot;a motley rabble of saucy boys, negroes, and molattoes, Irish teagues and outlandish Jack Tarrs&quot; (sailors). He then stated, &quot;And why we should scruple to call such a set of people a mob, I can&#x27;t conceive, unless the name is too respectable for them. The sun is not about to stand still or go out, nor the rivers to dry up because there was a mob in Boston on the 5th of March that attacked a party of soldiers.&quot;

Adams also described the former slave Crispus Attucks, saying &quot;his very look was enough to terrify any person&quot; and that &quot;with one hand [he] took hold of a bayonet, and with the other knocked the man down.&quot; However, two witnesses contradict this statement, testifying that Attucks was away from the soldiers when they began firing, too far away to take hold of a bayonet. Adams stated that it was Attucks&#x27; behavior that, &quot;in all probability, the dreadful carnage of that night is chiefly to be ascribed.&quot; He argued that the soldiers had the legal right to fight back against the mob and so were innocent. If they were provoked but not endangered, he argued, they were at most guilty of manslaughter.

The jury agreed with Adams&#x27; arguments and acquitted six of the soldiers after 2 hours of deliberation. Two of the soldiers were found guilty of manslaughter because there was overwhelming evidence that they had fired directly into the crowd. The jury&#x27;s decisions suggest that they believed that the soldiers had felt threatened by the crowd but should have delayed firing. The convicted soldiers pled benefit of clergy, the right to a lesser sentence for a first offender. This reduced their punishment from a death sentence to branding of the thumb in open court.

Patrick Carr&#x27;s deathbed account of the event also played a role in exonerating the eight defendants of murder charges. The testimony of John Jeffries is reprinted below:

Justices Edmund Trowbridge and Peter Oliver instructed the jury, and Oliver specifically addressed Carr&#x27;s testimony: &quot;this Carr was not upon oath, it is true, but you will determine whether a man just stepping into eternity is not to be believed, especially in favor of a set of men by whom he had lost his life&quot;. Carr&#x27;s testimony is one of the earliest recorded uses of the dying declaration exception to the inadmissibility of hearsay evidence in United States legal code.

The four civilians were tried on December 13. The principal prosecution witness was a servant of one of the accused who made claims that were easily rebutted by defense witnesses. They were all acquitted, and the servant was eventually convicted of perjury, whipped, and banished from the province.

==Legacy==

===Contribution to American Revolution===

The Boston Massacre is considered one of the most significant events that turned colonial sentiment against King George III and British Parliamentary authority. John Adams wrote that the &quot;foundation of American independence was laid&quot; on March 5, 1770, and Samuel Adams and other Patriots used annual commemorations (Massacre Day) to encourage public sentiment toward independence. Christopher Monk was the boy who was wounded in the attack and died in 1780, and his memory was honored as a reminder of British hostility.

Later events such as the Gaspee Affair and the Boston Tea Party further illustrated the crumbling relationship between Great Britain and its colonies. Five years passed between the massacre and outright war, and Neil York suggests that there is only a tenuous connection between the two. It is widely perceived as a significant event leading to the violent rebellion that followed. Howard Zinn argues that Boston was full of &quot;class anger&quot;. He reports that the &quot;Boston Gazette&quot; published in 1763 that &quot;a few persons in power&quot; were promoting political projects &quot;for keeping the people poor in order to make them humble.&quot;

===Commemorations===
The massacre was remembered in 1858 in a celebration organized by William Cooper Nell, a black abolitionist who saw the death of Crispus Attucks as an opportunity to demonstrate the role of African Americans in the Revolutionary War. Artwork was produced commemorating the massacre, changing the color of a victim&#x27;s skin to black to emphasize Attucks&#x27; death. In 1888, the Boston Massacre Monument was erected on the Boston Common in memory of the men killed in the massacre, and the five victims were reinterred in a prominent grave in the Granary Burying Ground.

The massacre is reenacted annually on March 5 under the auspices of the Bostonian Society. The Old State House, the massacre site, and the Granary Burying Ground are part of Boston&#x27;s Freedom Trail, connecting sites important in the city&#x27;s history.

<text>Ranger 2 was a flight test of the Ranger spacecraft system of the NASA Ranger program designed for future lunar and interplanetary missions. Ranger 2 was designed to test various systems for future exploration and to conduct scientific observations of cosmic rays, magnetic fields, radiation, dust particles, and a possible hydrogen gas &quot;tail&quot; trailing the Earth.

== Spacecraft design ==
Ranger 2 was of the Ranger Block 1 design and was almost identical to Ranger 1. The spacecraft consisted of a hexagonal base across, upon which was mounted a cone-shaped tower of aluminum struts and braces. Two solar panel wings measuring from tip to tip extended from the base. A high-gain directional dish antenna was attached to the bottom of the base. Spacecraft experiments and other equipment were mounted on the base and tower. Instruments aboard the spacecraft included a Lyman-alpha telescope, a rubidium-vapor magnetometer, electrostatic analyzers, medium-energy-range particle detectors, two triple coincidence telescopes, a cosmic-ray integrating ionization chamber, cosmic dust detectors, and scintillation counters.

The communications system included the high-gain antenna and an omnidirectional medium-gain antenna and two transmitters at approximately 960Â MHz, one with 0.25Â W power output and the other with 3Â W power output. Power was to be furnished by 8680 solar cells on the two panels, a silver-zinc battery, and smaller batteries on some of the experiments. Attitude control was provided by a solid state timing controller, Sun and Earth sensors, gyroscopes, and pitch and roll jets. The temperature was controlled passively by gold plating, white paint, and polished aluminum surfaces.

== Mission ==
Shortly after Ranger 1&#x27;s unsuccessful mission, Atlas 117D and Agena 6002 were rolled out to LC-12 for the next attempt. Once again, getting the booster and spacecraft ready for flight proved a frustrating experience. On October 24, NASA received the news from the West Coast of the United States that a hydraulics failure had prevented Discoverer 33 from reaching orbit the previous day, which necessitated taking Agena 6002 down from the stack and giving it a thorough checkout. The stage was found to have the same problem as Discoverer 33&#x27;s Agena, necessitating repair work. It took until mid-November before everything was finally ready. Liftoff took place at 3:12 AM EST on November 18. An improper autopilot signal resulted in Atlas BECO taking place 0.4 seconds early. Thus the sustainer phase of flight was initiated with below nominal velocity, but the vehicle reached orbit successfully since the guidance computer was programmed to not issue the SECO command until the proper velocity was achieved. The same malfunction had occurred on Atlas 105D/Midas 4 a month earlier and was traced to the location of the staging backup acceleration switch on the side of the LOX tank, causing the switch to be affected by the super-cold temperatures. The switch was moved to the fuel tank on subsequent Atlas-Agena vehicles.

When it came time for the second Agena restart, the result was once again a burn lasting a few seconds. This time, the problem was traced to a defective rate gyro in the Agena which had gone undetected at launch. The control system caused the stage to rotate uncontrollably with the result that the propellants were pushed to the outer edge of the tanks by centrifugal force and could not drain down into the fuel feed lines properly. Unlike with Ranger 1, the Agena had not operated long enough to achieve any significant ISP and so the probe was left in an even lower orbit. Tracking antennas could not lock onto the probe or send it any commands, nor could the attitude control system stabilize it. Telemetry and instrument data were still received for a few hours, but eventually the orbit decayed too low and after only one day and 19 orbits, Ranger 2 reentered the atmosphere and burned up.

<text>The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is a United Nations agency tasked with helping countries eliminate poverty and achieve sustainable economic growth and human development. The UNDP emphasizes on developing local capacity towards long-term self-sufficiency and prosperity.

Based at the headquarters of the United Nations in New York City, it is the largest UN development aid agency, with offices in 177 countries. The UNDP is funded entirely by voluntary contributions from UN member states.

== Founding ==
The UNDP was founded on 22 November 1965 through the merger of the Expanded Programme of Technical Assistance (EPTA) and the Special Fund in 1958. The rationale was to &quot;avoid duplication of [their] activities&quot;. The EPTA was set up in 1949 to support the economic and political aspects of underdeveloped countries while the Special Fund was to enlarge the scope of UN technical assistance. The Special Fund arose from the idea of a Special United Nations Fund for Economic Development (SUNFED) (which was initially known as the United Nations Fund for Economic Development (UNFED).

Countries such as the Nordic countries were proponents of such a United Nations (UN) controlled fund. However, the fund was opposed by other developed countries, especially by the United States, which were wary of the Third World dominating such funding and preferred it to be under the auspices of the World Bank. The concept of SUNFED was dropped to form the Special Fund. This Special Fund was a compromise over the SUNFED concept: it did not provide investment capital but only helped to bring pre-conditions for private investment.

With the US proposing and creating the International Development Association within the World Bank&#x27;s umbrella, the EPTA and the Special Fund appeared to be conducting similar work. In 1962, the United Nations Economic and Social Council asked the Secretary-General to consider the merits and disadvantages of merging UN technical assistance programmes and in 1966, the EPTA and the Special Fund merged to form the UNDP.

==Budget==

In 2022, UNDP&#x27;s budget was US$6,737.92 million.

===Funding information table===

The following table lists the top 15 DAC 5 Digit Sectors to which UNDP has committed funding, as recorded in its International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) publications. The UNDP claims on the IATI Registry website that the data covers 100% of development flows.

UNDP topped the Aid Transparency Index published by Publish What You Fund in 2015 and 2016, with an excellent score of 93.3%.

UNDP links and coordinates global and national efforts to achieve the goals and national development priorities laid out by host countries. UNDP focuses primarily on five developmental challenges:

====Democratic governance====
UNDP supports national democratic transitions by providing policy advice and technical support, improving institutional and individual capacity within countries, educating populations about and advocating for democratic reforms, promoting negotiation and dialogue, and sharing successful experiences from other countries and locations.

====Poverty reduction====

UNDP helps countries develop strategies to combat poverty by expanding access to economic opportunities and resources, linking poverty programmes with countries&#x27; larger goals and policies, and ensuring a greater voice for the poor. It also works at the macro level to reform trade, encourage debt relief and foreign investment, and ensure the poorest of the poor benefit from globalisation. 

The UNDP International Policy Centre for Inclusive Growth (IPC-IG) in BrasÃ­lia, Brazil, expands the capacities of developing countries to design, implement and evaluate socially inclusive development projects. IPC-IG is a global forum for South-South policy dialogue and learning, having worked with more than 7,000 officials from more than 50 countries.

A 2013 evaluation of the UNDP&#x27;s poverty reduction efforts states that the UNDP has effectively supported national efforts to reduce poverty, by helping governments make policy changes that benefit the poor. Nevertheless, the same evaluation also states there is a strong need for better measurement and monitoring of the impacts of the UNDP&#x27;s work. The UNDP&#x27;s Strategic Plan from 2014 to 2017 incorporates the recommendations of this poverty evaluation.

====Crisis prevention and recovery====
UNDP works to reduce the risk of armed conflicts or disasters, and promote early recovery after crisis have occurred. UNDP works through its country offices to support local government in needs assessment, capacity development, coordinated planning, and policy and standard setting.

Examples of UNDP risk reduction programmes include efforts to control small arms proliferation, strategies to reduce the impact of natural disasters, and programmes to encourage use of diplomacy and prevent violence. Recovery programmes include disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants, demining efforts, programmes to reintegrate displaced persons, restoration of basic services, and transitional justice systems for countries recovering from warfare.

Following the suspension of most foreign aid to Afghanistan due to its takeover by the Taliban, the UNDP took responsibility for funding most essential health services in the country, including the salaries of over 25,000 health care professionals. This was observed as being outside the organization&#x27;s usual development activities, and was facilitated by special licencing by the United States government.

====Environment and energy====
As the poor are disproportionately affected by environmental degradation and lack of access to clean, affordable water, sanitation, and energy services, UNDP seeks to address environmental issues in order to improve developing countries&#x27; abilities to develop sustainably, increase human development and reduce poverty. 

UNDP&#x27;s environmental strategy focuses on effective water governance including access to water supply and sanitation, access to sustainable energy services, Sustainable land management to combat desertification and land degradation, conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, and policies to control emissions of harmful pollutants and ozone-depleting substances. UNDP&#x27;s Equator Initiative office biennially offers the Equator Prize to recognize outstanding indigenous community efforts to reduce poverty through the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, and thus making local contributions to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Between 1996 and 1998, the UNDP sponsored the deployment of 45 Multifunction Platforms (MFP) in rural Mali. These installations, driven by a diesel engine, power devices such as pumps, grain mills and appliances. By 2004, the number of MFPs in Mali reached 500.

In 2012 the Biodiversity Finance Initiative (BIOFIN) was established. BIOFIN brings 30 countries together to develop and implement evidence-based finance plans to safeguard biodiversity. BIOFIN has developed an innovative and adaptable methodology to guide countries to analyze the policy and institutional context for biodiversity finance; measure the current biodiversity expenditures; assess future financial needs, and identify the most suitable finance solutions to achieve national biodiversity targets.

====HIV/AIDS====
UNDP works to help countries prevent further spreading of and reduce the impact of HIV/AIDS, convening The Global Commission on HIV and the Law which was reported in 2012.

====Hub for Innovative Partnerships====
Major programmes underway are:
* ART Global Initiative
* World Alliance of Cities Against Poverty
* Territorial Approach to Climate Change
* AfricaâKazakhstan Partnership for the SDGs

====Human Development Report====
Since 1991, the UNDP has annually published the Human Development Report, which includes topics on Human Development and the annual Human Development Index.

The Gender Inequality Index is one such topic discussed in the Human Development Report.

=== Evaluation ===
The UNDP spends about 0.2% of its budget on internal evaluation of the effectiveness of its programmes. The UNDP&#x27;s Evaluation Office is a member of the UN Evaluation Group (UNEG) which brings together all the units responsible for evaluation in the UN system. Currently the UNEG has 43 members and 3 observers.

The UNDP runs six Global Policy Centres, including the Seoul Policy Centre (USPC) on partnerships, the Nairobi Global Policy Centre on Resilient Ecosystems and Desertification (GPC-Nairobi), the Singapore-based Global Centre for Technology, Innovation and Sustainable Development (GC-TISD), the Istanbul International Centre for Private Sector in Development (IICPSD), the Oslo Governance Centre, and the Singapore-based Global Centre for Public Service Excellence (GCPSE) that issues the &quot;Raffles Review&quot; email newsletter on developments in public administration research.

== UN coordination role ==
UNDP plays a coordination role in the UN&#x27;s activities in the field of development. This is mainly executed through its vice-chair role of the UN Development Group and integrator function, within the broader the Resident Coordinator System. 

=== United Nations Development Group ===
The United Nations Development Group (UNDG) was created by the Secretary-General in 1997, to improve the effectiveness of UN development at the country level. The UNDG brings together the operational agencies working on development. The Group is chaired by the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, with the Administrator of UNDP serving as vice-chair. UN Development Coordination Office (DCO) provides the Secretariat to the Group.

The UNDG develops policies and procedures that allow member agencies to work together and analyse country issues, plan support strategies, implement support programmes, monitor results and advocate for change.

===Resident coordinator system===
The Resident Coordinator (RC) system coordinates all organizations of the United Nations system dealing with operational activities for development in the field. The RC system aims to bring together the different UN agencies to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of operational activities at the country level. Resident Coordinators lead UN country teams in more than 130 countries and are the designated representatives of the Secretary-General for development operations. Working closely with national governments, Resident Coordinators and country teams to advocate the interests and mandates of the UN drawing on the support and guidance of the entire UN family. It is now coordinated by the UNSDG, chaired by the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations.

== Innovation Facility ==
The UNDP established the Innovation Facility in 2014, with support from the Government of Denmark, as a dedicated funding mechanism to nurture promising development interventions.

The Innovation Facility offers technical assistance and seed funding to collaborators across 170 countries and territories to explore new approaches to complex development challenges. Since its inception, the Innovation Facility has fostered innovation labs across all five regions to better deliver and monitor the SDGs. In 2015, the Innovation Facility invested in 62 initiatives across 45 countries to achieve 16 SDGs.

==Controversies==

=== NSA surveillance ===
Documents of Edward Snowden showed in December 2013 that British and American intelligence agencies surveillance targets with the United States National Security Agency (NSA) included organisations such as the United Nations Development Programme, the UN&#x27;s children&#x27;s charity UNICEF and MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).

=== Allegations of UNDP resources used by Hamas ===

In August 2016, Israel&#x27;s Shin Bet security agency publicized the arrest of Wahid Abdallah al Bursh, a Palestinian engineer employed by the UNDP, stating he had confessed to being recruited in 2014 to help Hamas, the dominant Islamist group in Gaza. Among &quot;various assignments&quot; Bursh performed on behalf of Hamas was &quot;using UNDP resources&quot; to build a maritime jetty for its fighters; no further details were provided on this claim. Shin Bet also claimed Bursh had persuaded his UNDP superiors to prioritize neighbourhoods with Hamas operatives when earmarking reconstruction funds for Gaza, which was devastated by the 2014 war with Israel.

=== Alleged financial irregularities ===
The UNDP had been criticised by members of its staff and the Bush administration of the United States for irregularities in its finances in North Korea. Artjon Shkurtaj claimed that he had found counterfeit US dollars in the programmes&#x27; safe despite staff being paid in euros. The UNDP denied keeping improper accounts and any other wrongdoing.

=== Disarmament and controversy ===
In mid-2006, as first reported by Inner City Press and then by &quot;New Vision&quot;, UNDP halted its disarmament programmes in the Karamoja region of Uganda in response to human rights abuses in the parallel forcible disarmament programmes carried out by the Uganda People&#x27;s Defence Force.

=== Russia UNDP GEF Project Corruption Scandal ===
In 2019, reports alleging possible misappropriation of funds for UNDP projects in Russia began to appear in the mainstream media. An article called &quot;Greed and Graft at U.N. Climate Program&quot; in August 2019 in &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; reported the findings of a 2017 final evaluation that a UNDP Global Environment Facility greenhouse gas reduction project, the UNDP GEF Energy Efficiency Standards and Labels project in Russia with a budget of US$7.8 million, did not meet its goals and had &quot;strong indicators of deliberate misappropriation&quot; of funds. The &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; article reported that concerns raised by whistleblowers Dmitry Ershov and John O&#x27;Brien and multiple other consultants to the project over many years about irregularities in the programme â which were first reported internally as far back in 2011â were largely dismissed or ignored for several years by their superiors in Istanbul, New York, and Washington, as well as by donor governments, including the United States. The &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; article reported that a 2017 confidential audit appendix prepared by final evaluators found &quot;strong indicators of deliberate misappropriation&quot; of millions of dollars in funds from the project between 2010 and 2014.

This led in March 2020 to 12 donor governments writing a letter to UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner demanding from UNDP an independent review of UNDP&#x27;s handling of the energy efficiency standards and labels project in Russia, as reported again in &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine in December 2020 where it was revealed that these donors had blasted UNDP for resisting appeals to fight corruption and further reports by the Financial Times about the &#x27;systemic nature&#x27; of the problems and also reports by various other media outlets such as Climate Change News, Passblue and in Newsroom in the New Zealand media. In January 2021, this independent report into the matter as requested by the donors was published, &#x27;Systems and Silos&#x27;. This independent review found &quot;irregularities&quot; and concluded the project in question was not managed &quot;either efficiently or effectively&quot; by UNDP and that a number of individuals were able to &#x27;game the relatively weak systems of governance and technical capacity.&#x27; It suggested UNDP consider returning to the Global Environment Facility (which funded the project) its &quot;entire management fee&quot; as &quot;restitution&quot; and proposed &quot;ongoing efforts to achieve changes in the work culture that reward greater transparency and remove fears of unfair reprisals&quot; aimed at whistleblowers. Concerns over UNDP&#x27;s failure to handle the Russia controversy in a satisfactory manner led to the government of the Netherlands withholding some 10 million euros in funding in early 2021.

In February 2022, the leaders of three leading NGOs in the fight against corruption, Transparency International, the Whistleblower International Network or WIN, and the Government Accountability Project wrote a public letter to UNDP&#x27;s administrator Achim Steiner, expressing their serious concerns about the lack of whistleblower protection for John O&#x27;Brien and Dmitry Ershov by UNDP and highlighting the conclusion of the independent review on the failure by UNDP to carry out John O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s whistleblower case in a satisfactory manner. According to the 2019 Foreign Policy article, Ershov claimed he was &quot;pushed out of his U.N. job&quot; after raising concerns about procurement irregularities and project conflicts of interest way back at the end of 2014.

In June 2022, BBC Two broadcast a 90-minute documentary,&quot;The Whistleblowers: Inside the UN&quot;, which reported on whistleblower cases across the UN system, including John O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s case. It reported that O&#x27;Brien was fired from UNDP in March 2022 several days after his BBC interview. The documentary was described by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as exposing &quot;a toxic culture&quot; where senior UN leaders hide &quot;behind a cloak of saintliness.&quot;

=== Iraq UNDP Funding Facility for Stabilisation Corruption Scandal ===

In on 22 January 2024, the Guardian Newspaper reported that the US$1.88 billion funding facility for stabilization was riddled with corruption. The Guardian discovered that there had been some 136 corruption allegation cases to its Office of Audit and Investigations (OAI) in relation to the reconstruction programme â the majority of which were against suppliers rather than employees. Then on 5 February 2024, the Guardian Newspaper reported that UNDP had commissioned an internal management review of the Iraq corruption problems. It also reported that several donors had requested an independent review which exactly is what happened in the case of the UNDP GEF Russia corruption scandal.

The Guardian articles clearly show that the corruption problems at UNDP and the failure to protect whistleblowers remain, and have not been fixed. The Guardian Newspaper article reveals very similar themes of widespread kickbacks and corruption, staff who are scared to report wrongdoing, and almost no protection for whistleblowers who are scared to come forward in case they are retaliated against and/or lose their jobs.

== Administrator ==
The UNDP Administrator has the rank of an Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations. While the Administrator is often referred to as the third highest-ranking official in the UN (after the Secretary-General and Deputy Secretary-General), this has never been formally codified.

In addition to his/her responsibilities as head of UNDP, the Administrator is also the vice-chair of the UN Sustainable Development Group.

The position of Administrator is appointed by the Secretary-General of the UN and confirmed by the General Assembly for a term of four years.

Achim Steiner is the current Administrator. The five countries on the UNDP board have some influence over selection of the administrator.

The first administrator of the UNDP was Paul G. Hoffman, former head of the Economic Cooperation Administration which administered the Marshall Plan.

Other holders of the position have included: Bradford Morse, a former Republican congressman from the U.S. state of Massachusetts; William Draper, an American venture capitalist and friend of George H. W. Bush who saw one of the UN system&#x27;s major achievements, the Human Development Report, introduced during his tenure; Mark Malloch Brown of the UK, who was previously Vice President of External Affairs at the World Bank and subsequently became UN Deputy Secretary-General; and Kemal DerviÅ, a former finance minister of Turkey and senior World Bank official.

=== Associate Administrator ===
During meetings of the United Nations Sustainable Development Group, which are chaired by the Administrator, UNDP is represented by the Associate Administrator. The position has been held by Holiang Xu (China) since June 2023. He replaced Usha Rao-Monari (India)

<text>Tsarina or tsaritsa (also spelled csarina or csaricsa, tzarina or tzaritza, or czarina or czaricza; ; ; ) is the title of a female autocratic ruler (monarch) of Bulgaria, Serbia, and Russia, or the title of a tsar&#x27;s wife. The English spelling is derived from the German &quot;czarin&quot; or &quot;zarin&quot;, in the same way as the French &quot;tsarine&quot; / &quot;czarine&quot;, and the Spanish and Italian &quot;czarina&quot; / &quot;zarina&quot;. 
(A tsar&#x27;s daughter is a tsarevna.)

&quot;Tsarina&quot; or &quot;tsaritsa&quot; was the title of the female supreme ruler in the following states:
*Bulgaria: in 913â1018, in 1185â1422 and in 1908â1946
*Serbia: in 1346â1371
*Russia: officially from about 1547 until 1721, unofficially in 1721â1917 (officially &quot;Empresses&quot;).

==Russia==
Since 1721, the official titles of the Russian male and female monarchs were emperor () and empress () or empress consort, respectively. Officially the last Russian tsarina was Eudoxia Lopukhina, Peter the Great&#x27;s first wife. Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse), the wife of Nicholas II of Russia, was the last Russian empress.

Eudoxia Lopukhina was sent to a monastery in 1698 (which was the usual way the emperor &quot;divorced&quot; his wife), and she died in 1731. In 1712 Peter married in church Catherine I of Russia. The Russian Empire was officially proclaimed in 1721, and Catherine became empress by marriage. After Peter&#x27;s death she became ruling empress by her own right. In following centuries, the title &quot;tsarina&quot; was in unofficial informal use â a kind of &quot;pet name&quot; for empresses, whether ruling queens or queen consorts. (&quot;Mother dear-tsaritsa&quot; () was used only for Catherine the Great, the most popular empress.)
&quot;De jure&quot; tsarinas in Russia existed from 1547 until 1721. Among the most famous tsarinas of this period were six or seven wives of Ivan the Terrible, who were poisoned by his enemies, killed or imprisoned by him in monasteries. However, only the first four of them were crowned tsarinas, as the later marriages were not blessed by the Orthodox Church and were considered as cohabitation. Polish noblewoman Marina Mnishek also became tsarina of Russia by her marriage to the impostor False Dmitry I and later to False Dmitry II.

Many wives were chosen by bride-show (the custom of beauty pageant, borrowed from the Byzantine Empire), when hundreds of poor but handsome noblewomen gathered in Moscow from all the regions of Russia and the tsar chose the most beautiful. This deprived Russia of the benefits of royal intermarriage with European monarchs, but protected from inbreeding, as well as from the political influence of foreign princesses (Catholic or Protestant). The only foreign wife of a Russian tsar in this early era (except Mnishek) was Maria Temryukovna, a Circassian princess, who converted to Orthodoxy.

==Bulgaria==
The first Bulgarian ruler to use the title tsar was Simeon I of Bulgaria, and his consort (her name is uncertain, reportedly Maria Sursuvul) used the title tsarina. The title was used by subsequent Bulgarian consorts until the end of the First Bulgarian Empire in 1018. The last royal spouse to use the title was Maria, the wife of Ivan Vladislav of Bulgaria. 

When the Second Bulgarian Empire was created in 1185 the rulers again adopted the title tsar and their consorts were therefore called tsarinas. 

In the Third Bulgarian State, Ferdinand I of Bulgaria adopted the title tsar after he proclaimed Bulgaria&#x27;s Independence in 1908, and his wife, Eleonore Reuss of KÃ¶stritz, previously &quot;knyaginya&quot;, became &quot;tsaritsa&quot;. The last Bulgarian tsaritsa was Giovanna of Italy, the wife of Tsar Boris III of Bulgaria. Margarita GÃ³mez-Acebo y Cejuela, the wife of Simeon II of Bulgaria, is also sometimes referred as a tsaritsa.

==Serbia==
The first Serbian tsarina was Helena of Bulgaria, sister of Bulgarian Tsar Ivan Alexander and wife of Tsar Stephen UroÅ¡ IV DuÅ¡an of Serbia. She was the empress consort of Serbia from 1346 until DuÅ¡an&#x27;s sudden death in 1355. The second (and the last) Serbian tsarina was Anna, Empress of Serbia, from the Wallachian noble house of Basarab. She married DuÅ¡an&#x27;s son, Tsar Stephen UroÅ¡ V of Serbia, sometime in the 1350s, and ruled until the Serbian empire&#x27;s demise in 1371.

<text>The year 545 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. In the Roman Empire, it was known as year 209 &quot; [[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;. The denomination 545 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. 

In the Buddhist calendar, it corresponds to the year 0, traditionally the year when the Buddha reached parinirvana. However, different traditions disagree about the actual year 0, with many placing it in the following year 544 BC instead.

<text>Anders (or Andreas) Dahl (17 March 1751 â 25 May 1789) was a Swedish botanist and student of Carl Linnaeus. The dahlia flower is named after him.

==Early life and education==

Andreas (Anders) Dahl was the son of Christoffer Dahl, a preacher, and his wife, Johanna Helena Enegren. He was probably christened &quot;Andreas&quot; but was known as &quot;Anders&quot;. He had an older brother Erik who was born in 1749, also in Varnhem.

In 1755, the family moved from Varnhem to the parish of Saleby outside LidkÃ¶ping where his father became the parish priest; Anders&#x27; younger brother Kristoffer was born there in 1758. His mother died in 1760, and two years later, Christoffer married Helena Elisabeth Kolmodin, daughter of the poet Olof Kolmodin. A half-brother, Olof Kolmodin Dahl, was born in 1766. After his stepmother&#x27;s death in 1768, his father married for a third time; Anna Christina Svinhufvud, in 1770. Christoffer Dahl died a year later, in 1771.

From an early age Dahl was interested in botany. Anders TidstrÃ¶m, a disciple of pioneering botanist and taxonomist Carl Linnaeus, met the nine-year-old Dahl during his second journey through VÃ¤stergÃ¶tland in 1760, and mentions in his travel diary both young Anders&#x27; interest in botany, and his collection of plants (received from his uncle Anders Silvius, a chemist in Skara).

In 1761 Dahl began school in Skara, and found several schoolmates who shared his interest in natural science. In conjunction with the parish priest and naturalist Clas Bjerkander, Dahl, Johan Abraham, entomologist Leonard Gyllenhaal, chemist Johan Afzelius, Daniel NÃ¦zÃ©n and Olof KnÃ¶s founded &quot;The Swedish Topographic Society in Skara&quot; on 13 December 1769. The members reported on plant and animal life, geography, topography, historical monuments and economic life, mostly in the VÃ¤stergÃ¶tland area. During this time Dahl wrote several essays in these subjects; most of them are still unpublished.

On 3 April 1770 Dahl entered Uppsala University, where he became one of Linnaeus&#x27;s students. After his father&#x27;s death in 1771, Dahl&#x27;s family fell into financial straits and he had to leave school; prematurely ending his formal education. On 1 May 1776 he passed a preliminary candidate exam for medicine, the equivalent of a bachelor&#x27;s degree.

==Life as a naturalist==

On a recommendation from Linnaeus, Dahl served as curator at the private natural museum and botanical garden of Clas AlstrÃ¶mer, a Linnaean disciple, at Kristinedal in Gamlestaden, outside Gothenburg. Dahl&#x27;s employment involved several journeys in Sweden and abroad, where he collected natural history specimens both for AlstrÃ¶mer and himself. During that time, AlstrÃ¶mer received several plants from Linnaeus himself, and Dahl was able to review the Linnean collection, which is now included in the collections of the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm.

In 1781, AlstrÃ¶mer provided the financial backing for Linnaeus&#x27;s son, Carl Linnaeus the Younger, to journey to England; on the Younger&#x27;s death in 1783, Linnaeus sent AlstrÃ¶mer the &quot;herbarium parvum&quot;. This herbarium consisted of duplicates sorted out from Linnaeus&#x27; personal herbarium and other plants collected by his son. Dahl catalogued every specimen in the herbarium in his own handwriting, noting whether they came from &quot;a LinnÃ© P[ater].&quot; (father) or &quot;a LinnÃ© f[ilius].&quot; (son). It is clear that Dahl also received specimens; some specimens are labelled &quot;Dahl a LinnÃ© P.&quot; or &quot;Dahl a LinnÃ© f.&quot; On AlstrÃ¶mer&#x27;s death in 1794, the herbarium was left to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, then to the Swedish Museum of Natural History. The specimens Dahl and AlstrÃ¶mer received from Linnaeus and his son are in the Linnean herbarium in Stockholm. 
When AlstrÃ¶mer experienced financial losses in 1785 and moved to his estate at GÃ¥sevadsholm, outside Kungsbacka, Dahl followed.

In 1786, the University of Kiel conferred an honorary Doctorate of Medicine on Dahl in Kiel, Germany, and the following year he became associate professor at the Academy of Ãbo in Turku (today&#x27;s University of Helsinki), teaching medicine and botany. He brought his personal herbarium to Turku, which later was destroyed in the historic fire of 1827. Parts of Dahl&#x27;s collections have been preserved in Sahlberg&#x27;s herbarium in the Botanical Museum at the University of Helsinki, and in Giseke&#x27;s herbarium in the Royal Botanical Garden at Edinburgh.

Dahl died in 1789 in Turku at the age of 38.

==Publications==

Dahl&#x27;s inventories of flora around Skara and Saleby, and some of the papers he wrote during as a student at Skara and Uppsala are in the Olof KnÃ¶s Collection in the county library of Skara. The collection includes the minutes of &quot;The Swedish Topographic Society in Skara&quot; which contains some papers written by Dahl. Inspired by Linnaeus, Dahl wrote a &quot;Horologium Florae&quot;, a &quot;flower-clock&quot; of Skara, which was posthumously published in &quot;Ny Journal uti HushÃ¥llningen&quot;, in MayâJune 1790. Olof KnÃ¶s was the keeper of the minute-book and most probably published the article. Johan Abraham Gyllenhaal&#x27;s collections in the university library at Uppsala also contain some papers written by Dahl.

On 3 January 1777, an excerpt from an anonymous letter was published in Inrikes Tidningar. The writer had, during a journey from Stockholm to Gothenburg in July 1776, visited &quot;Himmels-KÃ¤llan&quot; in Varnhem. The letter describes the quality of the spring and 58 species from the swamp around it are. It is presumed that since Dahl often visited Varnhem and his friend Jonas Odhner that the letter came from him.

Dahl&#x27;s only publication during his time in Gothenburg was a result of what was probably one of the first environmental-impact studies. Waste from the manufacturing of herring oil was a major problem, causing polluted water and sea bed organism death. Dahl was one of three members of a commission who studied the issue and wrote regulations regarding waste products from the try houses. This document was the first historical step towards a restriction of industrial waste in Sweden. Dahl&#x27;s diary on the draggings in the archipelago of BohuslÃ¤n was published in Stockholm&#x27;s &quot;Trangrum-Acten&quot; in 1784.
During his short time at Turku Dahl published his most important work: &quot;Observationes botanicae circa systema vegetabilium divi a Linne Gottingae 1784 editum, quibus accedit justae in manes Linneanos pietatis specimen&quot; (Kopenhagen, 1787).

==Dahlia eponymy==
The naming of the &quot;dahlia&quot; after Dahl has long been a subject of some confusion. Many sources state that the name was bestowed by Linnaeus. However, Linnaeus died in 1778, more than eleven years before the plant was introduced into Europe, so he could not have been the one to honour his former student. It is most probable that first attempt to scientifically define the genus was done by Abbe Antonio Jose Cavanilles, Director of the Royal Gardens of Madrid, who received the first specimens from Mexico in 1791, two years after Dahl&#x27;s death.

Dahl was also honoured in the 1780s, Carl Peter Thunberg, a friend from Uppsala, named a species of plant from the family &quot;Hamamelidaceae&quot; after him. The &quot;Dahlia crinita&quot; is a reference to Dahl&#x27;s appearance, probably to his large beard, since &quot;crinita&quot; is Latin for &quot;longhaired&quot;. Thunberg finally published the name in 1792. The plant has now been reclassified as &quot;Trichocladus crinitus (Thunb.) Pers.&quot;.

Thunberg&#x27;s original specimen is in the Swedish Museum of Natural History.

He was also honored in 1994, when Constance &amp; Breedlove named a genus of plant from New Mexico, &quot;Dahliaphyllum&quot;, after him, along with its one species &quot;Dahliaphyllum almedae&quot;.

<doc id="82268" wikidata="Q193215" url="?curid=82268" title="ChÃ¢teau de Chenonceau">
<text>The ChÃ¢teau de Chenonceau () is a French chÃ¢teau spanning the river Cher, near the small village of Chenonceaux, Indre-et-Loire, Centre-Val de Loire. It is one of the best-known chÃ¢teaux of the Loire Valley.

The estate of Chenonceau is first mentioned in writing in the 11th century. The current chÃ¢teau was built in 1514â1522 on the foundations of an old mill and was later extended to span the river. The bridge over the river was built (1556â1559) to designs by the French Renaissance architect Philibert de l&#x27;Orme, and the gallery on the bridge, built from 1570 to 1576 to designs by Jean Bullant.

==Description==
An architectural mixture of late Gothic and early Renaissance, ChÃ¢teau de Chenonceau and its gardens are open to the public. Other than the Royal Palace of Versailles, it is the most visited chÃ¢teau in France.

The chÃ¢teau has been designated as a &quot;Monument historique&quot; since 1840 by the French Ministry of Culture. Today, Chenonceau is a major tourist attraction and in 2007 received around 800,000Â visitors.

== History ==

===The Marques family===
In the 13th century, the fief of Chenonceau belonged to the Marques family. The original chÃ¢teau was torched in 1412 to punish the owner, Jean Marques, for an act of sedition. He rebuilt a chÃ¢teau and fortified mill on the site in the 1430s. Jean Marques&#x27; indebted heir Pierre Marques found it necessary to sell.
===Thomas Bohier===
, Chamberlain to King Charles VIII of France, purchased the castle from Pierre Marques in 1513 and demolished most of it (resulting in 2013 being considered the 500th anniversary of the castle: MDXIIIâMMXIII), though its 15th-century keep was left standing. Bohier built an entirely new residence between 1515 and 1521. The work was overseen by his wife Katherine BriÃ§onnet, who delighted in hosting French nobility, including King Francis I on two occasions.

===Diane de Poitiers===
In 1535 the chÃ¢teau was seized from by King Francis I of France for unpaid debts to the Crown. After Francis&#x27; death in 1547, Henry II offered the chÃ¢teau as a gift to his mistress, Diane de Poitiers, who became fervently attached to the chÃ¢teau along the river. In 1555 she commissioned Philibert de l&#x27;Orme to build the arched bridge joining the chÃ¢teau to its opposite bank. Diane then oversaw the planting of extensive flower and vegetable gardens along with a variety of fruit trees. Set along the banks of the river, but buttressed from flooding by stone terraces, the exquisite gardens were laid out in four triangles.

Diane de Poitiers was the unquestioned mistress of the castle, but ownership remained with the crown until 1555 when years of delicate legal manoeuvres finally yielded possession to her.

===Catherine de&#x27; Medici===
After King Henry II died in 1559, his strong-willed widow and regent Catherine de&#x27; Medici forced Diane to exchange it for the ChÃ¢teau Chaumont. Queen Catherine then made Chenonceau her own favourite residence, adding a new series of gardens.

As Regent of France, Catherine spent a fortune on the chÃ¢teau and on spectacular nighttime parties. In 1560, the first-ever fireworks display seen in France took place during the celebrations marking the ascension to the throne of Catherine&#x27;s son Francis II. The grand gallery, which extended along the existing bridge to cross the entire river, was dedicated in 1577. Catherine also added rooms between the chapel and the library on the east side of the &quot;corps de logis&quot;, as well as a service wing on the west side of the entry courtyard.


Catherine considered an even greater expansion of the chÃ¢teau, shown in an engraving published by Jacques Androuet du Cerceau in the second (1579) volume of his book &quot;Les plus excellents bastiments de France&quot;. If this project had been executed, the current chÃ¢teau would have been only a small portion of an enormous manor laid out &quot;like pincers around the existing buildings.&quot;

===Louise de Lorraine===
On Catherine&#x27;s death, in January 1589, the chÃ¢teau went to her daughter-in-law, Louise of Lorraine, wife of King Henry III. Louise was at Chenonceau when she learned of her husband&#x27;s assassination, in August 1589, and she fell into a state of depression. Louise spent the next 11 years, until her death in January 1601, wandering aimlessly along the chÃ¢teau&#x27;s corridors dressed in mourning clothes, amidst sombre black tapestries stitched with skulls and crossbones.

===Duc de VendÃ´me===
Henry IV obtained Chenonceau for his mistress Gabrielle d&#x27;EstrÃ©es by paying the debts of Catherine de&#x27; Medici, which had been inherited by Louise and were threatening to ruin her. In return, Louise left the chÃ¢teau to her niece FranÃ§oise de Lorraine, at that time six years old and betrothed to the four-year-old CÃ©sar, Duke of VendÃ´me, the natural son of Gabrielle d&#x27;EstrÃ©es and Henry IV. The chÃ¢teau belonged to the Duke of VendÃ´me and his descendants for more than a hundred years. The Bourbons had little interest in the chÃ¢teau, except for hunting. In 1650, Louis XIV was the last king of the &quot;ancien rÃ©gime&quot; to visit.

The ChÃ¢teau de Chenonceau was bought by the Duke of Bourbon in 1720. Little by little, he sold off all of the castle&#x27;s contents. Many of the fine statues ended up at Versailles.

===Louise Dupin===
In 1733 the estate was sold for 130,000Â livres to a wealthy squire named . His wife, Louise Dupin, was the natural daughter of the financier Samuel Bernard and the actress , whose mother was also an actress who had joined the ComÃ©die FranÃ§aise in 1684. Louise Dupin was &quot;an intelligent, beautiful, and highly cultivated woman who had the theatre in her blood.&quot; Claude Dupin, a widower, had a son, Louis Claude, from his first wife Marie-Aurore de Saxe, who was the grandmother of George Sand (born Aurore Dupin).

Louise Dupin&#x27;s literary salon at Chenonceau attracted such leaders of the Enlightenment as the writers Voltaire, Montesquieu, and Fontenelle, the naturalist Buffon, the playwright Marivaux, the philosopher Condillac, as well as the Marquise de Tencin and the Marquise du Deffand. Jean-Jacques Rousseau was Dupin&#x27;s secretary and tutored her son. Rousseau, who worked on &quot;Ãmile&quot; at Chenonceau, wrote in his &quot;Confessions&quot;: &quot;We played music there and staged comedies. I wrote a play in verse entitled &quot;Sylvie&#x27;s Path&quot;, after the name of a path in the park along the Cher.&quot;

The widowed Louise Dupin saved the chÃ¢teau from destruction during the French Revolution, preserving it from being destroyed by the Revolutionaries because &quot;it was essential to travel and commerce, being the only bridge across the river for many miles.&quot; 

===Marguerite Pelouze===

In 1864 , a rich heiress, acquired the chÃ¢teau. Around 1875 she commissioned the architect FÃ©lix Roguet to restore it. He almost completely renewed the interior and removed several of Catherine de&#x27; Medici&#x27;s additions, including the rooms between the library and the chapel and her alterations to the north faÃ§ade, among which were figures of Hercules, Pallas, Apollo, and Cybele that were moved to the park. With the money Marguerite spent on these projects and elaborate parties, her finances were depleted, and the chÃ¢teau was seized and sold.

===Recent history===
JosÃ©-Emilio Terry, a Cuban millionaire, acquired Chenonceau from Madame Pelouze in 1891. Terry sold it in 1896 to a family member, Francisco Terry. In 1913, the chÃ¢teau was acquired by Henri Menier, a member of the Menier family, famous for their chocolates, who still own it to this day.

During World War I, Gaston Menier set up the gallery to be used as a hospital ward. During the Second World War, the chÃ¢teau was bombed by the Germans in June 1940. It was also a means of escaping from the Nazi-occupied zone on one side of the River Cher to the &quot;free&quot; zone on the opposite bank. Occupied by the Germans, the chÃ¢teau was bombed by the Allies on 7 June 1944, when the chapel was hit and its windows destroyed.

In 1951, the Menier family entrusted the chÃ¢teau&#x27;s restoration to Bernard Voisin, who brought the dilapidated structure and the gardens (ravaged in the Cher flood in 1940) back to a reflection of its former glory.

<doc id="82269" wikidata="Q193540" url="?curid=82269" title="Focal length">
<text>The focal length of an optical system is a measure of how strongly the system converges or diverges light; it is the inverse of the system&#x27;s optical power. A positive focal length indicates that a system converges light, while a negative focal length indicates that the system diverges light. A system with a shorter focal length bends the rays more sharply, bringing them to a focus in a shorter distance or diverging them more quickly. For the special case of a thin lens in air, a positive focal length is the distance over which initially collimated (parallel) rays are brought to a focus, or alternatively a negative focal length indicates how far in front of the lens a point source must be located to form a collimated beam. For more general optical systems, the focal length has no intuitive meaning; it is simply the inverse of the system&#x27;s optical power.

In most photography and all telescopy, where the subject is essentially infinitely far away, longer focal length (lower optical power) leads to higher magnification and a narrower angle of view; conversely, shorter focal length or higher optical power is associated with lower magnification and a wider angle of view. On the other hand, in applications such as microscopy in which magnification is achieved by bringing the object close to the lens, a shorter focal length (higher optical power) leads to higher magnification because the subject can be brought closer to the center of projection.

== Thin lens approximation ==
For a thin lens in air, the focal length is the distance from the center of the lens to the principal foci (or &quot;focal points&quot;) of the lens. For a converging lens (for example a convex lens), the focal length is positive and is the distance at which a beam of collimated light will be focused to a single spot. For a diverging lens (for example a concave lens), the focal length is negative and is the distance to the point from which a collimated beam appears to be diverging after passing through the lens.

When a lens is used to form an image of some object, the distance from the object to the lens &quot;u&quot;, the distance from the lens to the image &quot;v&quot;, and the focal length &quot;f&quot; are related by
:formula_1

The focal length of a thin &quot;convex&quot; lens can be easily measured by using it to form an image of a distant light source on a screen. The lens is moved until a sharp image is formed on the screen. In this case is negligible, and the focal length is then given by 
:formula_2

Determining the focal length of a &quot;concave&quot; lens is somewhat more difficult. The focal length of such a lens is defined as the point at which the spreading beams of light meet when they are extended backwards. No image is formed during such a test, and the focal length must be determined by passing light (for example, the light of a laser beam) through the lens, examining how much that light becomes dispersed/ bent, and following the beam of light backwards to the lens&#x27;s focal point.

== General optical systems ==

For a &quot;thick&quot; lens (one which has a non-negligible thickness), or an imaging system consisting of several lenses or mirrors (e.g. a photographic lens or a telescope), there are several related concepts that are referred to as focal lengths:
;Effective focal length (EFL): The effective focal length is the inverse of the optical power of an optical system, and is the value used to calculate the magnification of the system. The imaging properties of the optical system can be modeled by replacing the system with an ideal thin lens with the same EFL. The EFL also provides a simple method for finding the nodal points without tracing any rays. It was previously called &quot;equivalent focal length&quot; (not to be confused with 35Â mm-equivalent focal length).
;Front focal length (FFL): The front focal length is the distance from the front focal point to the front principal plane .
;Rear focal length (RFL): The rear focal length is the distance from the rear principal plane to the rear focal point .
;Front focal distance (FFD): The front focal distance (FFD) () is the distance from the front focal point of the system () to the vertex of the &quot;first optical surface&quot; (). Some authors refer to this as &quot;front focal length&quot;.
;Back focal distance (BFD): Back focal distance (BFD) () is the distance from the vertex of the &quot;last optical surface&quot; of the system () to the rear focal point (). Some authors refer to this as &quot;back focal length&quot;.
For an optical system in air the effective focal length, front focal length, and rear focal length are all the same and may be called simply &quot;focal length&quot;. 
For an optical system in a medium other than air or vacuum, the front and rear focal lengths are equal to the EFL times the refractive index of the medium in front of or behind the lens ( and in the diagram above). The term &quot;focal length&quot; by itself is ambiguous in this case. The historical usage was to define the &quot;focal length&quot; as the EFL times the index of refraction of the medium. For a system with different media on both sides, such as the human eye, the front and rear focal lengths are not equal to one another, and convention may dictate which one is called &quot;the focal length&quot; of the system. Some modern authors avoid this ambiguity by instead defining &quot;focal length&quot; to be a synonym for EFL. 

The distinction between front/rear focal length and EFL is important for studying the human eye. The eye can be represented by an equivalent thin lens at an air/fluid boundary with front and rear focal lengths equal to those of the eye, or it can be represented by a equivalent thin lens that is totally in air, with focal length equal to the eye&#x27;s EFL.

For the case of a lens of thickness in air (), and surfaces with radii of curvature and , the effective focal length is given by the Lensmaker&#x27;s equation:

formula_3where is the refractive index of the lens medium. The quantity is also known as the optical power of the lens.
The corresponding front focal distance is:formula_4
and the back focal distance:
formula_5
In the sign convention used here, the value of will be positive if the first lens surface is convex, and negative if it is concave. The value of is negative if the second surface is convex, and positive if concave. Sign conventions vary between different authors, which results in different forms of these equations depending on the convention used.

For a spherically-curved mirror in air, the magnitude of the focal length is equal to the radius of curvature of the mirror divided by two. The focal length is positive for a concave mirror, and negative for a convex mirror. In the sign convention used in optical design, a concave mirror has negative radius of curvature, so

formula_6
where is the radius of curvature of the mirror&#x27;s surface.

See Radius of curvature (optics) for more information on the sign convention for radius of curvature used here.

== In photography ==


Camera lens focal lengths are usually specified in millimetres (mm), but some older lenses are marked in centimetres (cm) or inches.

Focal length and field of view (FOV) of a lens are inversely proportional. For a standard rectilinear lens, formula_7, where is the width of the film or imaging sensor.

When a photographic lens is set to &quot;infinity&quot;, its rear principal plane is separated from the sensor or film, which is then situated at the focal plane, by the lens&#x27;s focal length. Objects far away from the camera then produce sharp images on the sensor or film, which is also at the image plane.

To render closer objects in sharp focus, the lens must be adjusted to increase the distance between the rear principal plane and the film, to put the film at the image plane. The focal length , the distance from the front principal plane to the object to photograph , and the distance from the rear principal plane to the image plane are then related by:

formula_8

As is decreased, must be increased. For example, consider a normal lens for a 35Â mm camera with a focal length of 50Â mm. To focus a distant object (), the rear principal plane of the lens must be located a distance 50Â mm from the film plane, so that it is at the location of the image plane. To focus an object 1Â m away ( 1,000Â mm), the lens must be moved 2.6Â mm farther away from the film plane, to 52.6Â mm.

The focal length of a lens determines the magnification at which it images distant objects. It is equal to the distance between the image plane and a pinhole that images distant objects the same size as the lens in question. For rectilinear lenses (that is, with no image distortion), the imaging of distant objects is well modelled as a pinhole camera model. 
This model leads to the simple geometric model that photographers use for computing the angle of view of a camera; in this case, the angle of view depends only on the ratio of focal length to film size. In general, the angle of view depends also on the distortion.

A lens with a focal length about equal to the diagonal size of the film or sensor format is known as a normal lens; its angle of view is similar to the angle subtended by a large-enough print viewed at a typical viewing distance of the print diagonal, which therefore yields a normal perspective when viewing the print; 
this angle of view is about 53 degrees diagonally. For full-frame 35Â mm-format cameras, the diagonal is 43Â mm and a typical &quot;normal&quot; lens has a 50Â mm focal length. A lens with a focal length shorter than normal is often referred to as a wide-angle lens (typically 35Â mm and less, for 35Â mm-format cameras), while a lens significantly longer than normal may be referred to as a telephoto lens (typically 85Â mm and more, for 35Â mm-format cameras). Technically, long focal length lenses are only &quot;telephoto&quot; if the focal length is longer than the physical length of the lens, but the term is often used to describe any long focal length lens.

Due to the popularity of the 35Â mm standard, cameraâlens combinations are often described in terms of their 35Â mm-equivalent focal length, that is, the focal length of a lens that would have the same angle of view, or field of view, if used on a full-frame 35Â mm camera. Use of a 35Â mm-equivalent focal length is particularly common with digital cameras, which often use sensors smaller than 35Â mm film, and so require correspondingly shorter focal lengths to achieve a given angle of view, by a factor known as the crop factor.

==Optical power==

The optical power of a lens or curved mirror is a physical quantity equal to the reciprocal of the focal length, expressed in metres. A dioptre is its unit of measurement with dimension of reciprocal length, equivalent to one reciprocal metre, 1 dioptre = 1 mâ1. For example, a 2-dioptre lens brings parallel rays of light to focus at metre. A flat window has an optical power of zero dioptres, as it does not cause light to converge or diverge.

The main benefit of using optical power rather than focal length is that the thin lens formula has the object distance, image distance, and focal length all as reciprocals. Additionally, when relatively thin lenses are placed close together their powers approximately add. Thus, a thin 2.0-dioptre lens placed close to a thin 0.5-dioptre lens yields almost the same focal length as a single 2.5-dioptre lens.

<text>Electromagnetic warfare or electronic warfare (EW) is warfare involving the use of the electromagnetic spectrum (EM spectrum) or directed energy to control the spectrum, attack an enemy, or impede enemy operations. The purpose of electromagnetic warfare is to deny the opponent the advantage ofâand ensure friendly unimpeded access toâthe EM spectrum. Electromagnetic warfare can be applied from air, sea, land, or space by crewed and uncrewed systems, and can target communication, radar, or other military and civilian assets.

==The electromagnetic environment==
Military operations are executed in an information environment increasingly complicated by the electromagnetic spectrum. The electromagnetic spectrum portion of the information environment is referred to as the electromagnetic environment (EME). The recognized need for military forces to have unimpeded access to and use of the electromagnetic environment creates vulnerabilities and opportunities for electronic warfare in support of military operations.

Within the information operations construct, EW is an element of information warfare; more specifically, it is an element of offensive and defensive counterinformation.

NATO has a different and arguably more encompassing and comprehensive approach to EW. A military committee conceptual document from 2007, &quot;MCM_0142 Nov 2007 Military Committee Transformation Concept for Future NATO Electronic Warfare&quot;, recognised the EME as an operational maneuver space and warfighting environment/domain. In NATO, EW is considered to be warfare in the EME. NATO has adopted simplified language which parallels those used in other warfighting environments like maritime, land, and air/space. For example, an electronic attack (EA) is offensive use of EM energy, electronic defense (ED), and electronic surveillance (ES). The use of the traditional NATO EW terms, electronic countermeasures (ECM), electronic protective measures (EPM), and electronic support measures (ESM) has been retained as they contribute to and support electronic attack (EA), electronic defense (ED) and electronic surveillance (ES). Besides EW, other EM operations include intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance (ISTAR), and signals intelligence (SIGINT). Subsequently, NATO has issued EW policy and doctrine and is addressing the other NATO defense lines of development.

Primary EW activities have been developed over time to exploit the opportunities and vulnerabilities that are inherent in the physics of EM energy. Activities used in EW include electro-optical, infrared and radio frequency countermeasures; EM compatibility and deception; radio jamming, radar jamming and deception and electronic counter-countermeasures (or anti-jamming); electronic masking, probing, reconnaissance, and intelligence; electronic security; EW reprogramming; emission control; spectrum management; and wartime reserve modes.

==Subdivisions==
Electronic warfare consists of three major subdivisions: electronic attack (EA), electronic protection (EP), and electronic warfare support (ES).

=== Electronic attack ===
Electronic attack (EA), also known as electronic countermeasures (ECM), involves the offensive use of electromagnetic energy weapons, directed energy weapons, or anti-radiation weapons to attack personnel, facilities, or equipment with the intent of degrading, neutralizing, or destroying enemy combat capability including human life. In the case of electromagnetic energy, this action is most commonly referred to as &quot;jamming&quot; and can be performed on communications systems or radar systems. In the case of anti-radiation weapons, this often includes missiles or bombs that can home in on a specific signal (radio or radar) and follow that path directly to impact, thus destroying the system broadcasting.

In November 2021, Israel Aerospace Industries announced a new electronic warfare system named Scorpius that can disrupt radar and communications from ships, UAVs, and missiles simultaneously and at varying distances.

On 8 September 2024, Russian drones entered both Romanian and Latvian airspace. Romania scrambled two F-16s to monitor the drone&#x27;s progress, it landed &quot;in an uninhabited area&quot; near Periprava, according to the Romanian Ministry of Defence. The drone that entered Latvian airspace from Belarus crashed near Rezekne. This comes as the ISW noted increased success in Ukrainian Electronic Warfare against Russian drones that resulted in &quot;several Russian Shahed drones (that) recently failed to reach their intended targets for unknown reasons.&quot; Two Kh-58s also reportedly failed to reach their targets.

=== Electronic protection ===
Electronic protection (EP), also known as an electronic protective measure (EPM) or electronic counter-countermeasure (ECCM) are a measure used to protect against an electronic enemy attack (EA) or to protect against friendly forces who unintentionally deploy the equivalent of an electronic attack on friendly forces. (sometimes called &quot;EW fratricide&quot;). The effectiveness of electronic protection (EP) level is the ability to counter an electronic attack (EA).

Flares are often used to distract infrared homing missiles into missing their target. The use of flare rejection logic in the guidance (seeker head) of an infrared homing missile to counter an adversary&#x27;s use of flares is an example of EP. While defensive EA actions (jamming) and EP (defeating jamming) both protect personnel, facilities, capabilities, and equipment, EP protects from the &quot;effects&quot; of EA (friendly and/or adversary). Other examples of EP include spread spectrum technologies, the use of restricted frequency lists, emissions control (EMCON), and low observability (stealth) technology.

Electronic warfare self-protection (EWSP) is a suite of countermeasure systems fitted primarily to aircraft for the purpose of protecting the host from weapons fire and can include, among others: directional infrared countermeasures (DIRCM, flare systems and other forms of infrared countermeasures for protection against infrared missiles; chaff (protection against radar-guided missiles); and DRFM decoy systems (protection against radar-targeted anti-aircraft weapons).

An electronic warfare tactics range (EWTR) is a practice range that provides training for personnel operating in electronic warfare. There are two examples of such ranges in Europe: one at RAF Spadeadam in the northwest county of Cumbria, England, and the Multinational Aircrew Electronic Warfare Tactics Facility Polygone range on the border between Germany and France. EWTRs are equipped with ground-based equipment to simulate electronic warfare threats that aircrew might encounter on missions. Other EW training and tactics ranges are available for ground and naval forces as well.

Antifragile EW is a step beyond standard EP, occurring when a communications link being jammed actually increases in capability as a result of a jamming attack, although this is only possible under certain circumstances such as reactive forms of jamming.

=== Electronic warfare support ===
Electronic warfare support (ES) is a subdivision of EW involving actions taken by an operational commander or operator to detect, intercept, identify, locate, and/or localize sources of intended and unintended radiated electromagnetic (EM) energy. These Electronic Support Measures (ESM) aim to enable immediate threat recognition focuses on serving military service needs even in the most tactical, rugged, and extreme environments. This is often referred to as simply reconnaissance, although today, more common terms are intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) or intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance (ISTAR). The purpose is to provide immediate recognition, prioritization, and targeting of threats to battlefield commanders.

Signals intelligence (SIGINT), a discipline overlapping with ES, is the related process of analyzing and identifying intercepted transmissions from sources such as radio communication, mobile phones, radar, or microwave communication. SIGINT is broken into two categories: electronic intelligence (ELINT) and communications intelligence (COMINT). Analysis parameters measured in signals of these categories can include frequency, bandwidth, modulation, and polarization.

The distinction between SIGINT and ES is determined by the controller of the collection assets, the information provided, and the intended purpose of the information. Electronic warfare support is conducted by assets under the operational control of a commander to provide tactical information, specifically threat prioritization, recognition, location, targeting, and avoidance. However, the same assets and resources that are tasked with ES can simultaneously collect information that meets the collection requirements for more strategic intelligence.

==History==
The earliest documented use of EW was during the Second Boer War of 1899â1902. The British Army, when trying to relieve Ladysmith, under siege by the Boers, used a searchlight to &quot;bounce&quot; Morse code signals off the clouds. The Boers immediately spotted this and used one of their own searchlights in an attempt to jam the British signals. This was graphically described by Winston Churchill in his book &quot;London to Ladysmith via Pretoria&quot;. 

During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904â1905 the Japanese auxiliary cruiser &quot;Shinano Maru&quot; had located the Russian Baltic Fleet in Tsushima Strait, and was communicating the fleet&#x27;s location by radio signals to the Imperial Japanese Fleet HQ. The captain of the Russian warship &quot;Ural&quot; requested permission to disrupt the Japanese communications link by attempting to transmit a stronger radio signal over the &quot;Shinano Maru&#x27;s&quot; signal, hoping to distort the Japanese signal at the receiving end. Russian Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky refused the advice and denied the &quot;Ural&quot; permission to electronically jam the enemy, which in those circumstances might have proved invaluable. The intelligence the Japanese gained ultimately led to the decisive Battle of Tsushima, where the Russian Navy lost all its battleships and most of its cruisers and destroyers. These losses effectively ended the Russo-Japanese War in Japan&#x27;s favor.

During World War II, the Allies and Axis Powers both extensively used EW, or what Winston Churchill referred to as the &quot;Battle of the Beams&quot;: as navigational radars were used to guide bombers to their targets and back to their base, the first application of EW in WWII was to interfere with the navigational radars. Chaff was also introduced during WWII to confuse and defeat tracking radar systems.

As battlefield communication and radar technology improved, so did electronic warfare, which played a major role in several military operations during the Vietnam War. Aircraft on bombing runs and air-to-air missions often relied on EW to survive the battle, although many were defeated by Vietnamese ECCM.

In 2007, an Israeli attack on a suspected Syrian nuclear site during Operation Outside the Box (or Operation Orchard) used electronic warfare systems to disrupt Syrian air defenses while Israeli jets crossed much of Syria, bombed their targets, and returned to Israel undeterred. The target was a suspected nuclear reactor under construction near the Euphrates River, modeled after a North Korean reactor and supposedly financed with Iranian assistance. Some reports say Israeli EW systems deactivated all of Syria&#x27;s air defense systems for the entire period of the raid.

In December 2010, the Russian Army deployed their first land-based multifunctional electronic warfare system known as Borisoglebsk 2, developed by Sozvezdie. Development of the system started in 2004 and evaluation testing successfully completed in December 2010. The Borisoglebsk-2 uses four different types of jamming stations on a single system. The Borisoglebsk-2 system is mounted on nine MT-LB armored vehicles and is intended to suppress mobile satellite communications and satellite-based navigation signals. This EW system is developed to conduct electronic reconnaissance and suppression of radio-frequency sources. In August 2015, the Swedish newspaper said its initial usage caused concern within NATO. A Russian blog described Borisoglebsk-2 thus:


During the first two days of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian EW disrupted Ukraine&#x27;s air defense radars and communications, severely disrupting Ukrainian ground-based air defense systems. Russian jamming was so effective it interfered with their own communications, so efforts were scaled back. This led to Ukrainian SAMs regaining much of their effectiveness, which began inflicting significant losses on Russian aircraft by the start of March 2022. Rapid Russian advances at the start of the war prevented EW troops from properly supporting the advancing troops, but by late March and April 2022, extensive jamming infrastructure had been deployed. EW complexes were set up in Donbas in concentrations of up to 10 complexes per of frontage. Electronic suppression of GPS and radio signals caused heavy losses of Ukrainian UAVs, depriving them of intelligence and precise artillery fire spotting. Small quadcopters had an average life expectancy of around three flights, and larger fixed-wing UAVs like the Bayraktar TB2 had a life expectancy of about six flights. By summer 2022, only some one-third of Ukrainian UAV missions could be said to have been successful, as EW had contributed to Ukraine losing 90% of the thousands of drones it had at the beginning of the invasion.

Russian EW capacity to disrupt GPS signals is credited with the reduction in the success of Ukrainian usage of HIMARS and JDAM bombs. The failure of GPS guidance forces these weapons, in particular JDAMS, to use inertial navigation system which reduces accuracy from around down to around .

Ukraine was losing some 10,000 drones a month due to Russian electronic warfare, according to a 19 May 2023 report by the Royal United Services Institute. This was an average of 300 drones a day. Russia has established EW posts about every of the front, being some back from the front line. In October 2023, &quot;The Economist&quot; reported that electronic warfare was in widespread use on front lines to impair small battlefield UAV activity, with Russia installing video feedback and control jammers on high-value equipment like tanks and artillery. By 11 March 2024, Ukraine reported it had destroyed a Russian Palantin EW system in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, which &quot;suppress satellite radio navigation along the entire line of contact and in most parts of Ukraine, replacing the satellite radio navigation field (spoofing)&quot;. An estimated three Palantin systems have been hit (June 2022, February 2023, and March 2024). In addition to the Palantin, in Zaporizhzhia a Layer EW system was destroyed.

=== Cognitive Electronic Warfare (CEW) ===
Originating from digital EW, and as a continuation of software based modulation and demodulation, cognitive electronic warfare or cognitive electromagnetic warfare (CEW), is the use of AI in electronic warfare systems.

CEW is affecting all electronic warfare subdivisions, and can improve situation-assessment (SA) and ESM, through automatic detection and classification of new and unknown signals, signatures, and even RCS. Cognitive electronic warfare systems can be used to collect ESM data and assist augmenting, updating, and broadcasting (over JTIDS), real time maps with electronic order of battle (EOB) and electronic identification (EID) data. As well as the ability to adapt in real time to changes in the eletromagnetic spectrum, by using artificial intelligence algorithms to quickly generate optimal EA, or EP solutions. 

It can provide more comprehensive information to cryptologic technicians, by helping to select the jamming techniques that will be the most effective, and therefore provide faster and better ECM, or ECCM, decisions. 

CEW is part of the &quot;Electromagnetic Spectrum Superiority Strategy&quot; (ESSS), published in October 2020, according to Lieutenant Commander Brian P. Gannon, U.S. Navy. DARPA has used CEW in some SIGINT studies with convolutional neural networks. DARPA had projects such as Blade, and ARC, which are related to R&amp;D on CEW

<text>Vilhelm Ludwig Peter Thomsen (25 January 1842 â 12 May 1927) was a Danish linguist and Turkologist. He successfully deciphered the Turkic Orkhon inscriptions which were discovered during the expedition of Nikolai Yadrintsev in 1889.

==Early life and education==
Vilhelm Thomsen was born in Copenhagen. He was the son of Chamber Councillor (&quot;kammerrÃ¥d&quot;) Ludvig Frederik Thomsen and the elder brother of painter and illustrator Carl Thomsen (1847â1912).

He studied at the University of Copenhagen in 1859, graduating in 1867 and earning a PhD in 1869 with a dissertation on Germanic loanwords in Finnic.

==Career==
He taught Greek at the Borgerdyd school in Copenhagen before becoming a professor at the University of Copenhagen. From 1875, he was an associate professor of comparative linguistics at the University of Copenhagen, and in 1887 he was appointed professor.
In 1876 he was invited to give the Ilchester Lectures at the University of Oxford, which were later published as &quot;The Relations Between Ancient Russia and Scandinavia, and the Origin of the Russian State&quot;.

Thomsen made a number of important contributions to linguistics, including his work on the Germanic, Baltic, and Indo-Iranian influences on Finnic. In 1893, he deciphered the Turkic Orkhon inscriptions ahead of Russian linguist Wilhelm Radloff (1837â1918). Thomsen first published the translation in French in 1899. He then published another interpretation in Danish in 1922 with a more complete translation.

According to an article on &quot;The history of Uralic linguistics&quot; by Bo Wickman (1988:808):
:The Danish scholar Vilhelm Thomsen (1842â1927) was one of the greatest linguists of all times. He was active in an astoundingly great number of linguistic disciplines, and he was equally masterful in all of them.

==Personal life==

Thomsen married Karen Charlotte Allen (22 August 1852 â 15 August 1934), a daughter of historian C.F. Allen (1811â71) and Ide Marie Dorph (1812â1910), on 5 May 1876 in Frederiksberg. Thomsen&#x27;s daughter Kristiane Nicoline Thomsen (1877â1968) was the second wife of the Finnish linguist Emil Nestor SetÃ¤lÃ¤.

He died on 12 May 1927 in Copenhagen and is buried in Solbjerg Park Cemetery.

==Honours==
*In 1912 he received membership of the Order of the Elephant.
*Thomsen is honored on a stela set up in central Copenhagen along with three other Danish pioneers of modern linguistics; Rasmus Rask, Niels Ludvig Westergaard and Karl Verner.
*Thomsen was President of the Danish Academy from 1909 until his death, and was an honorary member of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland.
*&quot;Wilhelm Thomsen Caddesi&quot; is a street that is named after him in Ankara, Turkey, on which the National Library of Turkey is located.

==Selected publications==
*The relations between ancient Russia and Scandinavia and the origin of the Russian state. Three lectures delivered at the Taylor Institution, Oxford, in May, 1876, in accordance with the terms of Lord Ilchester&#x27;s bequest to the university
*1896: &quot;Inscriptions De L&#x27;Orkhon DÃ©chiffrÃ©es&quot;
*&quot;On the influence of the Germanic languages on the Finnish-Lappish&quot;

<text>Blackwork, sometimes historically termed Spanish blackwork, is a form of embroidery generally worked in black thread, although other colours are also used on occasion, as in scarletwork, where the embroidery is worked in red thread. Most strongly associated with Tudor period England, blackwork typically, though not always, takes the form of a counted-thread embroidery, where the warp and weft yarns of a fabric are counted for the length of each stitch, producing uniform-length stitches and a precise pattern on an even-weave fabric. Blackwork may also take the form of free-stitch embroidery, where the yarns of a fabric are not counted while sewing.

Traditionally, blackwork is worked in silk thread on white or off-white linen or cotton fabric. Sometimes metallic threads or coloured threads are used for accents.

==Technique==

The stitches used for counted thread blackwork are double running or holbein stitch, backstitch, and sometimes stem stitch. Historically, blackwork was worked on plain-weave fabric. Modern embroiderers often use an even-weave fabric made especially for counted thread work.

Historically, there were three common styles of blackwork. In the earliest forms of blackwork, counted stitches were worked to make a geometric or small floral pattern. Most modern blackwork is produced in this style, especially commercially produced patterns marketed for embroidery hobbyists.

Later blackwork featured large designs of flowers, fruit, and other patterns connected by curvilinear stems. These were frequently not counted thread work, and were outlined with stem stitch, with the outlined patterns filled in with geometric counted designs.

In the third style of blackwork, the outlined patterns were &quot;shaded&quot; with random stitches called seed stitches. This style of blackwork imitates etchings or woodcuts.

==History==
European blackwork embroidery was preceded by Mamluk Egyptian running stitch embroideries and Indian Kasuti. The key difference between these techniques and European blackwork is that they are often more colorful. Kasuti sometimes uses multiple colors in a piece, and Mamluk embroideries typically were monochrome, but done in black, red, blue, green, and yellow.

Historically, blackwork was used on chemises, shirts or smocks in England from the time of Henry VIII. The common name &quot;Spanish work&quot; was based on the belief that Catherine of Aragon brought many blackwork garments with her from Spain, and portraits of the later 15th and early 16th centuries show black embroidery or other trim on Spanish chemises. However, black embroidery was known in England before 1500. Geoffrey Chaucer in the Canterbury Tales describes the clothing of the miller&#x27;s wife, Alison: &quot;Of white, too, was the dainty smock she wore, embroidered at the collar all about with coal-black silk, alike within and out.&quot;

Blackwork in silk thread on linen was the most common domestic embroidery technique for clothing (shirts, smocks, sleeves, ruffs, and caps) and for household items such as cushion covers throughout the reign of Elizabeth I, but lost popularity as a technique by the 17th century.

Historic blackwork embroidery is rare to find well-preserved, as the iron-based dye used to create the thread&#x27;s black colour was corrosive, and there are currently no conservation techniques that can stop the decay. Black embroidery silk from outside England, such as Spain, contained less iron in the black dye and so blackwork worked using non-English silk tends to survive in better condition.

===16th-century blackwork===
==Modern blackwork==

Blackwork remains popular as an embroidery technique. Common subjects among hobbyists include chessboards, maps, Tudor houses, roses and cats. Much of the success of a blackwork design using free embroidery depends on how tone values are translated into stitches.

Today, the term &quot;blackwork&quot; is used to refer to the technique, rather than the precise colour used in the embroidery.

<text>The genus Cajanus is a member of the plant family Fabaceae. There are 37 species, mainly distributed across Africa, Asia and Australasia.

Species include the pigeon pea (&quot;C. cajan&quot;), which is a significant food crop.

The natural range of &quot;Cajanus&quot; species includes West Africa, Madagascar and the Comoros, the Indian Subcontinent, Indochina, southern China and Taiwan, Malesia, New Guinea, and northern Australia. Typical habitats include seasonally-dry tropical open forest, woodland, and grassland, often in rocky or disturbed areas. Some species, including &quot;Cajanus cajan&quot;, have been introduced to the tropical Americas, elsewhere in Africa, and to central Asia.
