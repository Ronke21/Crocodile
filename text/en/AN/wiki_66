===Early settlement===
The pace of white settlement in the Southeast increased greatly after the War of 1812 and the Treaty of Fort Jackson and the subsequent availability of land previously settled by Native Americans. A small assortment of log cabins soon arose near the large Creek village at the fall line of the river, which the new settlers named in honor of the sixteenth-century Chief Tuskaloosa. of a Muskogean-speaking tribe and paramount chief of the Mississippian culture. To form the word, they combined the Choctaw words &quot;tushka&quot; or &quot;tashka&quot; (&quot;warrior&quot;) and &quot;lusa&quot; (&quot;black&quot;).

In 1817, Alabama became a territory. Tuscaloosa County was established on February 6, 1818. On December 13, 1819, the territorial legislature incorporated the town of Tuskaloosa- now Tuscaloosa - one day before Congress admitted Alabama the Union as a state.

From 1826 to 1846, Tuskaloosa was the capital of Alabama. The State House was built at the corner of 6th Street and 28th Avenue (now the site of Capitol Park). In 1831, the University of Alabama was established.

===Civil War and Reconstruction===
During the antebellum years, the principal crop was cotton, cultivated and processed by African-American slaves. By 1860, shortly before Alabama&#x27;s secession from the Union, the county had a total of 12,971 whites, 84 &quot;free&quot; African Americans, and 10,145 African-American slaves; the latter comprised 43.7 percent of the total population. The Civil War brought significant changes, including migration out of the county by some African Americans. Some freedmen moved to nearby counties and larger cities for more opportunities and to join with other freedmen in communities less subject to white supervision and intimidation.

Several thousand men from Tuscaloosa County fought in the Confederate armies. During the last weeks of the War, a brigade of Union troops raiding the city burned the campus of the university. The town of Tuscaloosa was also damaged in the battle and shared fully in the South&#x27;s economic sufferings which followed the defeat. Following Reconstruction, there was violence as whites struggled to regain control of the state legislature. It reached a height in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Tuscaloosa County had a total of 10 documented lynchings of African Americans, according to a 2015 study by the Equal Justice Initiative.

In the 1890s the construction of a system of locks and dams on the Black Warrior River by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers improved navigation to such an extent that Tuscaloosa was effectively connected to the Gulf Coast seaport of Mobile. This stimulated the economy and trade, and mining and metallurgical industries were developed in the region. By the advent of the 20th century, the growth of the University of Alabama and the mental health-care facilities in the city, along with a strong national economy, fueled a steady growth in Tuscaloosa which continued unabated for 100 years.

In 1901, the state legislature passed a constitution that disenfranchised most African Americans and tens of thousands of poor whites and followed with Jim Crow laws enforcing racial segregation. Due to this oppression and problems of continued violence by lynchings, many African Americans left Alabama in two waves of the Great Migration in the first half of the 20th century. They went to Northern and Midwestern industrial cities. Their mass departure from Tuscaloosa County is reflected in the lower rates of county population growth from 1910 to 1930, and from 1950 to 1970. (see Census Table).

===Civil Rights era===
Blacks by 1960 represented 28.7% of the county population, and they were still disenfranchised throughout the state. African Americans in Tuscaloosa were active in demonstrations and other civil rights activities throughout the 1960s, seeking desegregation of public facilities, including the county courthouse. The university was at the center of significant moments in the civil rights movement, including the admission of Autherine Lucy and the pro-segregation demonstration that followed as well as the Stand in the Schoolhouse Door incident in which then-governor George Wallace attempted to stop desegregation of the institution by denying entrance to two African-American students.

The late 20th century brought positive economic news when Mercedes-Benz announced it would build its first U.S. assembly plant near Vance. The facility opened in 1995 and began assembling the R-Class Grand Sport Tourer in 2005. From 2006 to 2015 it produced the GL-Class vehicles; and since 1998 and 2015 respectively, has produced the GLS-Class and GLE-CLASS. The plant brought thousands of jobs to the area through its own direct hires as well as those of the many component suppliers it attracted.

===2000 to Present===
On April 27, 2011, the city of Tuscaloosa was hit by a half-mile (800 m) wide EF4 tornado, which was part of the 2011 Super Outbreak. It resulted in at least 44 deaths in the city, over 1000 injuries, and massive devastation. Officials at DCH Hospital (alone) in Tuscaloosa reported treating more than 1000 injured people in the first several days of the tornado aftermath. Mayor Maddox was quoted saying that &quot;We have neighborhoods that have been basically removed from the map.&quot; On April 29, President Barack Obama, upon touring the tornado damage in Tuscaloosa, said &quot;I have never seen devastation like this&quot;.

In the decade since, more than $1 billion in public and private funding has assisted the community in recovery. Former Tuscaloosa City Council President told NPR in 2021, &quot;Black, white, young and old come together and we worked through this thing and made Tuscaloosa what it is today.&quot;

According to a police violence tracking website, police have killed directly or indirectly 18 people over the last 21 years in the county, half of them African American.

<text>Washington County is a county located in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Alabama. As of the 2020 census, the population was 15,388. The county seat is Chatom. The county was named in honor of George Washington, the first President of the United States. In September 2018 The United States Office of Management and Budget (OMB) added Washington County to the Mobile, Alabama Metropolitan Statistical Area but was removed in effective July 2023.

The MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians is the first state-recognized tribe in Alabama. It is based in Washington County, with some members also in Mobile County, Alabama. A total of nine tribes have received state recognition since 1979.

==History==

The area of today&#x27;s Washington County was long inhabited by various indigenous people. In historic times, European traders encountered first Choctaw, whose territory extended through most of present-day Mississippi, and later Creek Indians, who had moved southwest from Georgia ahead of early European settlers who were encroaching on their land.

Washington County was organized on June 4, 1800, from the Tombigbee District of the Mississippi Territory by proclamation of territorial governor Winthrop Sargent. It was the first county organized in what would later become Alabama, as settlers moved westward after the American Revolutionary War. Washington County is the site of St. Stephens, the first territorial capital of Alabama. In 1807 former U.S. Vice President Aaron Burr was arrested at Wakefield in Washington County, during his flight from being prosecuted for alleged treason (of which he was eventually found innocent).

In the 1830s, the U.S. government removed most of the Choctaw and Creek to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma) west of the Mississippi River. Some members of these tribes stayed behind on their traditional lands in southwest Alabama, taking refuge in the forests and swamps. They were nominally considered state (and U.S.) citizens, but suffered severe racial discrimination.

In the 19th century, the county was largely developed for cotton plantations, with labor supplied by thousands of enslaved African Americans. Many had been transported by slave traders to the Deep South in a forced migration in the early part of the century, as the land was being developed.

During the American Civil War, more than three quarters of the adult white men in the county were serving in the Confederate Army by 1863. In that year, a group of children petitioned the Confederate government to avoid drafting more white men, so they might serve as a home guard militia. The petition claimed the militia was needed to guard against a potential slave uprising, since there were numerous cotton plantations with large numbers of enslaved African Americans. No such uprising occurred.

While the county continued to rely on agriculture into the 20th century, the infestation of the boll weevil destroyed many cotton crops. Mechanization and industrial-scale agriculture reduced the need for labor. Thousands of African Americans left the South in the Great Migration to Northern and Midwestern industrial cities, where they could get better jobs and escape the legal segregation and violence of the South. In the early 20th century industrialists began to harvest and process the pine and other timber in this area of the state.

The Choctaw and Creek Native Americans struggled to maintain their traditional culture, in the face of years during which the state government imposed a binary system of dividing people into white and &quot;all other&quot; people of color (blacks and Indians). Records no longer recognized their identifying as Choctaw, particularly in the period of Jim Crow after the Reconstruction era.

It was not until the 1930s that the Choctaw were able to get Indian schools to support their culture in Mobile and Washington counties, where their people have been concentrated. For a time they were called Cajun, but have no connection to such descendants of Acadians, based largely in Louisiana. The people pressed to gain recognition for their own ethnicity. In 1979 the Alabama legislature officially recognized the MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians. In 1984 it passed legislation to establish a commission to represent Native American interests in the state; through that, a total of nine tribes have received state recognition.

While the timber industry continued to be important to the economy, the county has gradually developed other businesses and industries, particularly petrochemical. Due to damage from Hurricane Frederic in 1979, the county was declared a disaster area that September.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.8%) is water. This makes Washington County larger than the state of Rhode Island in terms of land area (but not total area). The county is located approximately 60 miles north of the Gulf of Mexico, and exceeds 682,000 acres of land. About 88 percent of the land area is covered by forest and pine plantations.

The Tombigbee River borders Washington County to the east. From the southern point of the river, the boundary runs diagonally south-west, bisecting the community of Calvert. From there, the southern boundary runs west, roughly following the 31°08&#x27; N parallel, toward the Mississippi state line, descending due south into Mobile County and forming part of a rectangle that connects with the state line. The western boundary is defined by the Alabama-Mississippi state line (approximately 88°27&#x27; W). The northern boundary runs west from the state line along the 31°41&#x27; N parallel until reaching the Tombigbee River.

===Population decline===
Like many rural Alabama counties, Washington County has had rural flight since 2000, as younger people have moved to cities for work opportunities. Factors contributing to this phenomenon include depressed economic opportunity within the county and the ongoing urbanization of the United States. Urbanization, especially urban areas adjacent to a rural area, draws young people out of rural areas, offering more and better public services as well as access to better-paying, white-collar jobs.

==Education==
The Washington County School system operates public schools in the county. Its high schools include:
*Fruitdale High School
*Leroy High School
*McIntosh High School
*Millry High School
*Washington County High School

==Politics==
Like much of the Deep South, prior to the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, only white Washington County voters enjoyed the franchise, and they had long supported the Democratic Party in national, state and local elections. Most blacks had been disenfranchised since the turn of the century, as were many poor whites.

After Congress passed civil rights legislation under the leadership of President Lyndon Johnson, in addition to legislation to support his Great Society policies, the county&#x27;s conservative white electorate began to support Republican candidates in presidential elections. With revival of their constitutional rights in voting, African Americans tended to align with the national Democratic Party.

Following the presidency of Ronald Reagan and the rise of the Moral Majority of the 1980s, conservative white Washington County voters have increasingly elected Republicans in national elections, and they have essentially realigned with that party. Bill Clinton, a nominee from Arkansas, was the last Democratic presidential nominee to win Washington County, doing so in his successful 1996 reelection campaign. By contrast, the minority of African American and Native American voters continue to support Democratic candidates.











While Democrats, until 2015, continued to represent the county in both houses of the state legislature, voters have not supported a Democratic candidate for governor since 2002. That year the state&#x27;s last Democratic governor, Don Siegelman, lost reelection to Republican Bob Riley.

As of 2021, Brett Easterbrook (R-Fruitdale) has represented Washington County in the Alabama House of Representatives (District 65) since 2018. Greg Albritton (R-Excel) has represented Senate District 22, the bulk of the county (along with parts of seven other counties, stretching into south Baldwin County and as far north as Choctaw County, and from the Mississippi border on the west to as far east as the Escambia-Covington County border and Conecuh-Butler county border) in the Alabama Senate since 2015. An eastern sliver of the county along the Tombigbee falls in District 23, represented by Hank Sanders.

The county lies within Alabama&#x27;s 1st congressional district, which has been represented by Republican Jerry Carl since January 2021.

==Government==
Wilcox County leans heavily towards the Democratic Party. The only Republican to carry the county since 1900 has been Barry Goldwater in 1964 – when little to none of the county&#x27;s black majority had voted for over seven decades and opposition by the voting white minority to Civil Rights meant that national Democrat Lyndon Johnson was not allowed on the ballot. Even after the Voting Rights Act of 1965, black registration was so slow that segregationist George Wallace comfortably carried the county in 1968, but since then the Democratic presidential candidate has carried Wilcox in every election. It was one of only six Wallace counties to vote for George McGovern against Richard Nixon&#x27;s 3,000-plus-county landslide of 1972.

<doc id="81326" wikidata="Q48604" url="?curid=81326" title="Mir">
<text>Mir (, ; ) was a space station operated in low Earth orbit from 1986 to 2001, first by the Soviet Union and later by the Russian Federation. &quot;Mir&quot; was the first modular space station and was assembled in orbit from 1986 to 1996. It had a greater mass than any previous spacecraft. At the time it was the largest artificial satellite in orbit, succeeded by the International Space Station (ISS) after &quot;Mir&quot;&#x27;s orbit decayed. The station served as a microgravity research laboratory in which crews conducted experiments in biology, human biology, physics, astronomy, meteorology, and spacecraft systems with a goal of developing technologies required for permanent occupation of space.

&quot;Mir&quot; was the first continuously inhabited long-term research station in orbit and held the record for the longest continuous human presence in space at 3,644 days, until it was surpassed by the ISS on 23 October 2010. It holds the record for the longest single human spaceflight, with Valeri Polyakov spending 437 days and 18 hours on the station between 1994 and 1995. &quot;Mir&quot; was occupied for a total of twelve and a half years out of its fifteen-year lifespan, having the capacity to support a resident crew of three, or larger crews for short visits.

Following the success of the Salyut programme, &quot;Mir&quot; represented the next stage in the Soviet Union&#x27;s space station programme. The first module of the station, known as the core module or base block, was launched in 1986 and followed by six further modules. Proton rockets were used to launch all of its components except for the docking module, which was installed by US Space Shuttle mission STS-74 in 1995. When complete, the station consisted of seven pressurised modules and several unpressurised components. Power was provided by several photovoltaic arrays attached directly to the modules. The station was maintained at an orbit between and altitude and travelled at an average speed of 27,700 km/h (17,200 mph), completing 15.7 orbits per day.

The station was launched as part of the Soviet Union&#x27;s crewed spaceflight programme effort to maintain a long-term research outpost in space, and following the collapse of the USSR, was operated by the new Russian Federal Space Agency (RKA). As a result, most of the station&#x27;s occupants were Soviet; through international collaborations such as the Interkosmos, Euromir and Shuttle–&quot;Mir&quot; programmes, the station was made accessible to space travellers from several Asian, European and North American nations. &quot;Mir&quot; was deorbited in March 2001 after funding was cut off. The cost of the &quot;Mir&quot; programme was estimated by former RKA General Director Yuri Koptev in 2001 as $4.2 billion over its lifetime (including development, assembly and orbital operation).

==Origins==
&quot;Mir&quot; was authorised by a 17 February 1976 decree, to design an improved model of the Salyut DOS-17K space stations. Four Salyut space stations had been launched since 1971, with three more being launched during &quot;Mir&quot;&#x27;s development. It was planned that the station&#x27;s core module (DOS-7 and the backup DOS-8) would be equipped with a total of four docking ports; two at either end of the station as with the Salyut stations, and an additional two ports on either side of a docking sphere at the front of the station to enable further modules to expand the station&#x27;s capabilities. By August 1978, this had evolved to the final configuration of one aft port and five ports in a spherical compartment at the forward end of the station.

It was originally planned that the ports would connect to modules derived from the Soyuz spacecraft. These modules would have used a Soyuz propulsion module, as in Soyuz and Progress, and the descent and orbital modules would have been replaced with a long laboratory module. Following a February 1979 governmental resolution, the programme was consolidated with Vladimir Chelomei&#x27;s crewed Almaz military space station programme. The docking ports were reinforced to accommodate space station modules based on the TKS spacecraft. NPO Energia was responsible for the overall space station, with work subcontracted to KB Salyut, due to ongoing work on the Energia rocket and Salyut 7, Soyuz-T, and Progress spacecraft. KB Salyut began work in 1979, and drawings were released in 1982 and 1983. New systems incorporated into the station included the Salyut 5B digital flight control computer and gyrodyne flywheels (taken from Almaz), Kurs automatic rendezvous system, &quot;Luch&quot; satellite communications system, Elektron oxygen generators, and Vozdukh carbon dioxide scrubbers.

By early 1984, work on &quot;Mir&quot; had halted while all resources were being put into the Buran programme in order to prepare the &quot;Buran&quot; spacecraft for flight testing. Funding resumed in early 1984 when Valentin Glushko was ordered by the Central Committee&#x27;s Secretary for Space and Defence to orbit &quot;Mir&quot; by early 1986, in time for the 27th Communist Party Congress.

It was clear that the planned processing flow could not be followed and still meet the 1986 launch date. It was decided on Cosmonaut&#x27;s Day (12 April) 1985 to ship the flight model of the base block to the Baikonur Cosmodrome and conduct the systems testing and integration there. The module arrived at the launch site on 6 May, with 1100 of 2500 cables requiring rework based on the results of tests to the ground test model at Khrunichev. In October, the base block was rolled outside its cleanroom to carry out communications tests. The first launch attempt on 16 February 1986 was scrubbed when the spacecraft communications failed, but the second launch attempt, on 19 February 1986 at 21:28:23 UTC, was successful, meeting the political deadline.

==Station structure==

===Assembly===

The orbital assembly of &quot;Mir&quot; began on 19 February 1986 with the launch of the &quot;Proton-K&quot; rocket. Four of the six modules which were later added (&quot;Kvant&quot;-2 in 1989, &quot;Kristall&quot; in 1990, &quot;Spektr&quot; in 1995 and &quot;Priroda&quot; in 1996) followed the same sequence to be added to the main &quot;Mir&quot; complex. Firstly, the module would be launched independently on its own Proton-K and chase the station automatically. It would then dock to the forward docking port on the core module&#x27;s docking node, then extend its Lyappa arm to mate with a fixture on the node&#x27;s exterior. The arm would then lift the module away from the forward docking port and rotate it on to the radial port where it was to mate, before lowering it to dock. The node was equipped with only two &quot;Konus&quot; drogues, which were required for dockings. This meant that, prior to the arrival of each new module, the node would have to be depressurised to allow spacewalking cosmonauts to manually relocate the drogue to the next port to be occupied.

The other two expansion modules, &quot;Kvant&quot;-1 in 1987 and the docking module in 1995, followed different procedures. &quot;Kvant&quot;-1, having, unlike the four modules mentioned above, no engines of its own, was launched attached to a tug based on the TKS spacecraft which delivered the module to the aft end of the core module instead of the docking node. Once hard docking had been achieved, the tug undocked and deorbited itself. The docking module, meanwhile, was launched aboard during STS-74 and mated to the orbiter&#x27;s Orbiter Docking System. &quot;Atlantis&quot; then docked, via the module, to &quot;Kristall&quot;, then left the module behind when it undocked later in the mission. Various other external components, including three truss structures, several experiments and other unpressurised elements were also mounted to the exterior of the station by cosmonauts conducting a total of eighty spacewalks over the course of the station&#x27;s history.

The station&#x27;s assembly marked the beginning of the third generation of space station design, being the first to consist of more than one primary spacecraft (thus opening a new era in space architecture). First generation stations such as Salyut 1 and Skylab had monolithic designs, consisting of one module with no resupply capability; the second generation stations Salyut 6 and Salyut 7 comprised a monolithic station with two ports to allow consumables to be replenished by cargo spacecraft such as Progress. The capability of &quot;Mir&quot; to be expanded with add-on modules meant that each could be designed with a specific purpose in mind (for instance, the core module functioned largely as living quarters), thus eliminating the need to install all the station&#x27;s equipment in one module.

===Pressurised modules===
In its completed configuration, the space station consisted of seven different modules, each launched into orbit separately over a period of ten years by either Proton-K rockets or .


=== Unpressurised elements ===
In addition to the pressurised modules, &quot;Mir&quot; featured several external components. The largest component was the &quot;Sofora&quot; girder, a large scaffolding-like structure consisting of 20 segments which, when assembled, projected 14 metres from its mount on &quot;Kvant&quot;-1. A self-contained thruster block, the VDU (Vynosnaya Dvigatyelnaya Ustanovka), was mounted on the end of &quot;Sofora&quot; and was used to augment the roll-control thrusters on the core module. The VDU&#x27;s increased distance from &quot;Mir&quot;&#x27;s axis allowed an 85% decrease in fuel consumption, reducing the amount of propellant required to orient the station. A second girder, &quot;Rapana&quot;, was mounted aft of &quot;Sofora&quot; on &quot;Kvant&quot;-1. This girder, a small prototype of a structure intended to be used on &quot;Mir&quot;-2 to hold large parabolic dishes away from the main station structure, was 5 metres long and used as a mounting point for externally mounted exposure experiments.

To assist in moving objects around the exterior of the station during EVAs, &quot;Mir&quot; featured two &quot;Strela&quot; cargo cranes mounted to the sides of the core module, used for moving spacewalking cosmonauts and parts. The cranes consisted of telescopic poles assembled in sections which measured around when collapsed, but when extended using a hand crank were long, meaning that all of the station&#x27;s modules could be accessed during spacewalks.

Each module was fitted with external components specific to the experiments that were carried out within that module, the most obvious being the Travers antenna mounted to &quot;Priroda&quot;. This synthetic aperture radar consisted of a large dish-like framework mounted outside the module, with associated equipment within, used for Earth observations experiments, as was most of the other equipment on &quot;Priroda&quot;, including various radiometers and scan platforms. &quot;Kvant&quot;-2 also featured several scan platforms and was fitted with a mounting bracket to which the cosmonaut manoeuvring unit, or &quot;Ikar&quot;, was mated. This backpack was designed to assist cosmonauts in moving around the station and the planned &quot;Buran&quot; in a manner similar to the US Manned Maneuvering Unit, but it was only used once, during EO-5.

In addition to module-specific equipment, &quot;Kvant&quot;-2, &quot;Kristall&quot;, &quot;Spektr&quot; and &quot;Priroda&quot; were each equipped with one &quot;Lyappa&quot; arm, a robotic arm which, after the module had docked to the core module&#x27;s forward port, grappled one of two fixtures positioned on the core module&#x27;s docking node. The arriving module&#x27;s docking probe was then retracted, and the arm raised the module so that it could be pivoted 90° for docking to one of the four radial docking ports.

===Power supply===

Photovoltaic (PV) arrays powered &quot;Mir&quot;. The station used a 28 volt DC supply which provided 5-, 10-, 20- and 50-amp taps. When the station was illuminated by sunlight, several solar arrays mounted on the pressurised modules provided power to &quot;Mir&quot;&#x27;s systems and charged the nickel-cadmium storage batteries installed throughout the station. The arrays rotated in only one degree of freedom over a 180° arc, and tracked the Sun using Sun sensors and motors installed in the array mounts. The station itself also had to be oriented to ensure optimum illumination of the arrays. When the station&#x27;s all-sky sensor detected that &quot;Mir&quot; had entered Earth&#x27;s shadow, the arrays were rotated to the optimum angle predicted for reacquiring the Sun once the station passed out of the shadow. The batteries, each of 60 Ah capacity, were then used to power the station until the arrays recovered their maximum output on the day side of Earth.

The solar arrays themselves were launched and installed over a period of eleven years, more slowly than originally planned, with the station continually suffering from a shortage of power as a result. The first two arrays, each 38 m2 (409 ft2) in area, were launched on the core module, and together provided a total of 9 kW of power. A third, dorsal panel was launched on &quot;Kvant&quot;-1 and mounted on the core module in 1987, providing a further 2 kW from a 22 m2 (237 ft2) area. &quot;Kvant&quot;-2, launched in 1989, provided two 10 m (32.8 ft) long panels which supplied 3.5 kW each, whilst &quot;Kristall&quot; was launched with two collapsible, 15 m (49.2 ft) long arrays (providing 4 kW each) which were intended to be moved to &quot;Kvant&quot;-1 and installed on mounts which were attached during a spacewalk by the EO-8 crew in 1991.

This relocation was begun in 1995, when the panels were retracted and the left panel installed on &quot;Kvant&quot;-1. By this time all the arrays had degraded and were supplying much less power. To rectify this, &quot;Spektr&quot; (launched in 1995), which had initially been designed to carry two arrays, was modified to hold four, providing a total of 126 m2 (1360 ft2) of array with a 16 kW supply. Two further arrays were flown to the station on board the during STS-74, carried on the docking module. The first of these, the &quot;Mir&quot; cooperative solar array, consisted of American photovoltaic cells mounted on a Russian frame. It was installed on the unoccupied mount on &quot;Kvant&quot;-1 in May 1996 and was connected to the socket that had previously been occupied by the core module&#x27;s dorsal panel, which was by this point barely supplying 1 kW. The other panel, originally intended to be launched on &quot;Priroda&quot;, replaced the &quot;Kristall&quot; panel on &quot;Kvant&quot;-1 in November 1997, completing the station&#x27;s electrical system.

===Orbit control===

&quot;Mir&quot; was maintained in a near circular orbit with an average perigee of and an average apogee of , travelling at an average speed of 27,700 km/h (17,200 mph) and completing 15.7 orbits per day. As the station constantly lost altitude because of slight atmospheric drag, it needed to be boosted to a higher altitude several times each year. This boost was generally performed by Progress resupply vessels, although during the Shuttle-&quot;Mir&quot; programme the task was performed by US Space Shuttles, and, prior to the arrival of Kvant-1, the engines on the core module could also accomplish the task.

Attitude control was maintained by a combination of two mechanisms; in order to hold a set attitude, a system of twelve control moment gyroscopes (CMGs, or &quot;gyrodynes&quot;) rotating at 10,000 rpm kept the station oriented, six CMGs being located in each of the &quot;Kvant-1&quot; and &quot;Kvant-2&quot; modules. When the attitude of the station needed to be changed, the gyrodynes were disengaged, thrusters (including those mounted directly to the modules, and the VDU thruster used for roll control mounted to the &quot;Sofora&quot; girder) were used to attain the new attitude and the CMGs were reengaged. This was done fairly regularly depending on experimental needs; for instance, Earth or astronomical observations required that the instrument recording images be continuously aimed at the target, and so the station was oriented to make this possible. Conversely, materials processing experiments required the minimisation of movement on board the station, and so &quot;Mir&quot; would be oriented in a gravity gradient attitude for stability. Prior to the arrival of the modules containing these gyrodynes, the station&#x27;s attitude was controlled using thrusters located on the core module alone, and, in an emergency, the thrusters on docked Soyuz spacecraft could be used to maintain the station&#x27;s orientation.

===Communications===
Radio communications provided telemetry and scientific data links between &quot;Mir&quot; and the RKA Mission Control Centre (TsUP). Radio links were also used during rendezvous and docking procedures and for audio and video communication between crew members, flight controllers and family members. As a result, &quot;Mir&quot; was equipped with several communication systems used for different purposes. The station communicated directly with the ground via the &quot;Lira&quot; antenna mounted to the core module. The &quot;Lira&quot; antenna also had the capability to use the &quot;Luch&quot; data relay satellite system (which fell into disrepair in the 1990s) and the network of Soviet tracking ships deployed in various locations around the world (which also became unavailable in the 1990s). UHF radio was used by cosmonauts conducting EVAs. UHF was also employed by other spacecraft that docked to or undocked from the station, such as Soyuz, Progress, and the Space Shuttle, in order to receive commands from the TsUP and &quot;Mir&quot; crew members via the TORU system.

===Microgravity===
At &quot;Mir&quot;&#x27;s orbital altitude, the force of Earth&#x27;s gravity was 88% of sea level gravity. While the constant free fall of the station offered a perceived sensation of weightlessness, the onboard environment was not one of weightlessness or zero gravity. The environment was often described as microgravity. This state of perceived weightlessness was not perfect, being disturbed by five separate effects:
* The drag resulting from the residual atmosphere;
* Vibratory acceleration caused by mechanical systems and the crew on the station;
* Orbital corrections by the on-board gyroscopes (which spun at 10,000 rpm, producing vibrations of 166.67 Hz) or thrusters;
* Tidal forces. Any parts of &quot;Mir&quot; not at exactly the same distance from Earth tended to follow separate orbits. As each point was physically part of the station, this was impossible, and so each component was subject to small accelerations from tidal forces;
* The differences in orbital plane between different locations on the station.

===Life support===

&quot;Mir&quot;&#x27;s environmental control and life support system (ECLSS) provided or controlled atmospheric pressure, fire detection, oxygen levels, waste management and water supply. The highest priority for the ECLSS was the station&#x27;s atmosphere, but the system also collected, processed, and stored waste and water produced and used by the crew—a process that recycles fluid from the sink, toilet, and condensation from the air. The &quot;Elektron&quot; system generated oxygen electrolytically, venting hydrogen to space. Bottled oxygen and solid fuel oxygen generation (SFOG) canisters, a system known as &quot;Vika&quot;, provided backup. Carbon dioxide was removed from the air by the &quot;Vozdukh&quot; system. Other byproducts of human metabolism, such as methane from the intestines and ammonia from sweat, were removed by activated charcoal filters. Similar systems are presently used on the ISS.

The atmosphere on &quot;Mir&quot; was similar to Earth&#x27;s. Normal air pressure on the station was 101.3 kPa (14.7 psi); the same as at sea level on Earth. An Earth-like atmosphere offers benefits for crew comfort.

==International cooperation==

===Interkosmos===

Interkosmos () was a Soviet Union space exploration programme which allowed members from countries allied with the Soviet Union to participate in crewed and uncrewed space exploration missions. Participation was also made available to governments of countries such as France and India.

Only the last three of the programme&#x27;s fourteen missions consisted of an expedition to &quot;Mir&quot; but none resulted in an extended stay in the station:
* Muhammed Faris – EP-1 (1987) 
* Aleksandr Panayatov Aleksandrov – EP-2 (1988) 
* Abdul Ahad Mohmand – EP-3 (1988) 

===European involvement===

Various European astronauts visited &quot;Mir&quot; as part of several cooperative programmes:
* Jean-Loup Chrétien – &quot;Aragatz&quot; (1988) 
* Helen Sharman – Project Juno (1991) 
* Franz Viehböck – Austromir &#x27;91 (1991) 
* Klaus-Dietrich Flade – &quot;Mir&quot; &#x27;92 (1992) 
* Michel Tognini – &quot;Antarès&quot; (1992) 
* Jean-Pierre Haigneré – &quot;Altair&quot; (1993) 
* Ulf Merbold – Euromir &#x27;94 (1994) 
* Thomas Reiter – Euromir &#x27;95 (1995) 
* Claudie Haigneré – &quot;Cassiopée&quot; (1996) 
* Reinhold Ewald – &quot;Mir&quot; &#x27;97 (1997) 
* Léopold Eyharts – &quot;Pégase&quot; (1998) 
* Ivan Bella – &quot;Stefanik&quot; (1999) 

===Shuttle–&quot;Mir&quot; program===
In the early 1980s, NASA planned to launch a modular space station called &quot;Freedom&quot; as a counterpart to &quot;Mir&quot;, while the Soviets were planning to construct &quot;Mir&quot;-2 in the 1990s as a replacement for the station. Because of budget and design constraints, &quot;Freedom&quot; never progressed past mock-ups and minor component tests and, with the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Space Race, the project was nearly cancelled entirely by the United States House of Representatives. The post-Soviet economic chaos in Russia also led to the cancellation of &quot;Mir&quot;-2, though only after its base block, DOS-8, had been constructed. Similar budgetary difficulties were faced by other nations with space station projects, which prompted the US government to negotiate with European states, Russia, Japan, and Canada in the early 1990s to begin a collaborative project. In June 1992, American president George H. W. Bush and Russian president Boris Yeltsin agreed to cooperate on space exploration. The resulting &quot;Agreement between the United States of America and the Russian Federation Concerning Cooperation in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for Peaceful Purposes&quot; called for a short joint space programme with one American astronaut deployed to the Russian space station &quot;Mir&quot; and two Russian cosmonauts deployed to a Space Shuttle.

In September 1993, US Vice President Al Gore Jr., and Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin announced plans for a new space station, which eventually became the ISS. They also agreed, in preparation for this new project, that the United States would be heavily involved in the &quot;Mir&quot; programme as part of an international project known as the Shuttle–Mir Programme. The project, sometimes called &quot;Phase One&quot;, was intended to allow the United States to learn from Russian experience in long-duration spaceflight and to foster a spirit of cooperation between the two nations and their space agencies, the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roskosmos). The project prepared the way for further cooperative space ventures, specifically, &quot;Phase Two&quot; of the joint project, the construction of the ISS. The programme was announced in 1993; the first mission started in 1994, and the project continued until its scheduled completion in 1998. Eleven Space Shuttle missions, a joint Soyuz flight, and almost 1000 cumulative days in space for US astronauts occurred over the course of seven long-duration expeditions.

===Other visitors=== 
* Toyohiro Akiyama – &quot;Kosmoreporter&quot; (1990) 
* Chris Hadfield – STS-74 (1995) 
* A British con artist, Peter Rodney Llewellyn, almost visited &quot;Mir&quot; in 1999 on a private contract after promising US$100 million for the privilege.

==Life on board==

Inside, the &quot;Mir&quot; resembled a cramped labyrinth, crowded with hoses, cables and scientific instruments—as well as articles of everyday life, such as photos, children&#x27;s drawings, books and a guitar. It commonly housed three crew members, but was capable of supporting as many as six for up to a month. The station was designed to remain in orbit for around five years; it remained in orbit for fifteen. As a result, NASA astronaut John Blaha reported that, with the exception of &quot;Priroda&quot; and &quot;Spektr&quot;, which were added late in the station&#x27;s life, &quot;Mir&quot; did look used, which is to be expected given it had been lived in for ten to eleven years without being brought home and cleaned.

===Crew schedule===
The time zone used on board &quot;Mir&quot; was Moscow Time (MSK; UTC+03). The windows were covered during night hours to give the impression of darkness because the station experienced 16 sunrises and sunsets a day. A typical day for the crew began with a wake-up at 08:00 MSK, followed by two hours of personal hygiene and breakfast. Work was conducted from 10:00 until 13:00, followed by an hour of exercise and an hour&#x27;s lunch break. Three more hours of work and another hour of exercise followed lunch, and the crews began preparing for their evening meal at about 19:00. The cosmonauts were free to do as they wished in the evening, and largely worked to their own pace during the day.

In their spare time, crews were able to catch up with work, observe the Earth below, respond to letters, drawings, and other items brought from Earth (and give them an official stamp to show they had been aboard &quot;Mir&quot;), or make use of the station&#x27;s ham radio. Two amateur radio call signs, U1MIR and U2MIR, were assigned to &quot;Mir&quot; in the late 1980s, allowing amateur radio operators on Earth to communicate with the cosmonauts. The station was also equipped with a supply of books and films for the crew to read and watch.

NASA astronaut Jerry Linenger related how life on board &quot;Mir&quot; was structured and lived according to the detailed itineraries provided by ground control. Every second on board was accounted for and all activities were timetabled. After working some time on &quot;Mir&quot;, Linenger came to feel that the order in which his activities were allocated did not represent the most logical or efficient order possible for these activities. He decided to perform his tasks in an order that he felt enabled him to work more efficiently, be less fatigued, and suffer less from stress. Linenger noted that his comrades on &quot;Mir&quot; did not &quot;improvise&quot; in this way, and as a medical doctor he observed the effects of stress on his comrades that he believed was the outcome of following an itinerary without making modifications to it. Despite this, he commented that his comrades performed all their tasks in a supremely professional manner.

Astronaut Shannon Lucid, who set the record for longest stay in space by a woman while aboard &quot;Mir&quot; (surpassed by Sunita Williams 11 years later on the ISS), also commented about working aboard &quot;Mir&quot;: &quot;I think going to work on a daily basis on &quot;Mir&quot; is very similar to going to work on a daily basis on an outstation in Antarctica. The big difference with going to work here is the isolation, because you really are isolated. You don&#x27;t have a lot of support from the ground. You really are on your own.&quot;

===Exercise===

The most significant adverse effects of long-term weightlessness are muscle atrophy and deterioration of the skeleton, or spaceflight osteopenia. Other significant effects include fluid redistribution, a slowing of the cardiovascular system, decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders, and a weakening of the immune system. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, excess flatulence, and puffiness of the face. These effects begin to reverse quickly upon return to the Earth.

To prevent some of these effects, the station was equipped with two treadmills (in the core module and &quot;Kvant&quot;-2) and a stationary bicycle (in the core module); each cosmonaut was to cycle the equivalent of and run the equivalent of per day. Cosmonauts used bungee cords to strap themselves to the treadmill. Researchers believe that exercise is a good countermeasure for the bone and muscle density loss that occurs in low-gravity situations.

===Hygiene===

There were two space toilets (ASUs) on &quot;Mir&quot;, located in the core module and &quot;Kvant&quot;-2. They used a fan-driven suction system similar to the Space Shuttle Waste Collection System. The user is first fastened to the toilet seat, which was equipped with spring-loaded restraining bars to ensure a good seal. A lever operated a powerful fan and a suction hole slid open: the air stream carried the waste away. Solid waste was collected in individual bags which were stored in an aluminium container. Full containers were transferred to Progress spacecraft for disposal. Liquid waste was evacuated by a hose connected to the front of the toilet, with anatomically appropriate &quot;urine funnel adapters&quot; attached to the tube so both men and women could use the same toilet. Waste was collected and transferred to the Water Recovery System, where it could be recycled back into drinking water, but was usually used to produce oxygen via the &quot;Elektron&quot; system.

&quot;Mir&quot; featured a shower, the &quot;Bania&quot;, located in &quot;Kvant&quot;-2. It was an improvement on the units installed in previous Salyut stations, but proved difficult to use due to the time required to set up, use, and stow. The shower, which featured a plastic curtain and fan to collect water via an airflow, was later converted into a steam room; it eventually had its plumbing removed and the space was reused. When the shower was unavailable, crew members washed using wet wipes, with soap dispensed from a toothpaste tube-like container, or using a washbasin equipped with a plastic hood, located in the core module. Crews were also provided with rinse-less shampoo and edible toothpaste to save water.

On a 1998 visit to &quot;Mir&quot;, bacteria and larger organisms were found to have proliferated in water globules formed from moisture that had condensed behind service panels.

===Sleeping in space===
The station provided two permanent crew quarters, the &quot;Kayutkas&quot;, phonebox-sized booths set towards the rear of the core module, each featuring a tethered sleeping bag, a fold-out desk, a porthole, and storage for personal effects. Visiting crews had no allocated sleep module, instead attaching a sleeping bag to an available space on a wall; US astronauts installed themselves within &quot;Spektr&quot; until a collision with a Progress spacecraft caused the depressurisation of that module. It was important that crew accommodations be well ventilated; otherwise, astronauts could wake up oxygen-deprived and gasping for air, because a bubble of their own exhaled carbon dioxide had formed around their heads.

===Food and drink===

Most of the food eaten by station crews was frozen, refrigerated or canned. Meals were prepared by the cosmonauts, with the help of a dietitian, before their flight to the station. The diet was designed to provide around 100 g of protein, 130 g of fat and 330 g of carbohydrates per day, in addition to appropriate mineral and vitamin supplements. Meals were spaced out through the day to aid assimilation. Canned food such as jellied beef tongue was placed into a niche in the core module&#x27;s table, where it could be warmed in 5–10 minutes. Usually, crews drank tea, coffee and fruit juices, but, unlike the ISS, the station also had a supply of cognac and vodka for special occasions.

===Microbiological environmental hazards===
In the 1990s ninety species of micro-organisms were found inside &quot;Mir&quot;, four years after the station&#x27;s launch. By the time of its decommission in 2001, the number of known different micro-organisms had grown to 140. As space stations get older, the problems with contamination get worse. Molds that develop aboard space stations can produce acids that degrade metal, glass and rubber. The molds in &quot;Mir&quot; were found growing behind panels and inside air-conditioning equipment. The molds also caused a foul smell, which was often cited as visitors&#x27; strongest impression. Researchers in 2018 reported, after detecting the presence on the International Space Station (ISS) of five &quot;Enterobacter bugandensis&quot; bacterial strains, none pathogenic to humans, that microorganisms on ISS should be carefully monitored to continue ensuring a medically healthy environment for the astronauts.

Some biologists were concerned about the mutant fungi being a major microbiological hazard for humans, and reaching Earth in the splashdown, after having been in an isolated environment for 15 years. On the other hand, some scientists are conducting research on whether this situation can be used for life in space. Scientists have discovered that fungi could actually assist space travel and detect livable environments for humankind in space. In fact, these resilient and frequently underestimated organisms might hold the key to our future on other planets. Fungi play a dramatic role in creating innovative and sustainable building materials. Most fungi possess mycelia, hair-like root structures that grow and spread across surfaces. As mycelia expand, they bind surrounding materials, as wood chips, sawdust, or regolith (the loose material covering solid rock on planetary bodies like the Moon or Mars). This growth process results in a dense, interconnected network that creates a remarkably strong and durable substance. The resulting mycelium-based material offers notable thermal insulation and radiation protection, making it an ideal candidate for construction, particularly in severe environments like outer space or other interplanetary habitats.

==Station operations==

===Expeditions===
&quot;Mir&quot; was visited by a total of 28 long-duration or &quot;principal&quot; crews, each of which was given a sequential expedition number formatted as EO-X. Expeditions varied in length (from the 72-day flight of the crew of EO-28 to the 437-day flight of Valeri Polyakov), but generally lasted around six months. Principal expedition crews consisted of two or three crew members, who often launched as part of one expedition but returned with another (Polyakov launched with EO-14 and landed with EO-17). The principal expeditions were often supplemented with visiting crews who remained on the station during the week-long handover period between one crew and the next before returning with the departing crew, the station&#x27;s life support system being able to support a crew of up to six for short periods. The station was occupied for a total of four distinct periods; 12 March–16 July 1986 (EO-1), 5 February 1987 – 27 April 1989 (EO-2–EO-4), the record-breaking run from 5 September 1989 – 28 August 1999 (EO-5–EO-27), and 4 April–16 June 2000 (EO-28). By the end, it had been visited by 104 different people from twelve different nations, making it the most visited spacecraft in history (a record later surpassed by the ISS).

====Early existence====
Due to pressure to launch the station on schedule, mission planners were left without Soyuz spacecraft or modules to launch to the station at first. It was decided to launch Soyuz T-15 on a dual mission to both &quot;Mir&quot; and Salyut 7.

Leonid Kizim and Vladimir Solovyov first docked with &quot;Mir&quot; on 15 March 1986. During their nearly 51-day stay on &quot;Mir&quot;, they brought the station online and checked its systems. They unloaded two Progress spacecraft launched after their arrival, Progress 25 and Progress 26.

On 5 May 1986, they undocked from &quot;Mir&quot; for a day-long journey to Salyut 7. They spent 51 days there and gathered 400 kg of scientific material from Salyut 7 for return to &quot;Mir&quot;. While Soyuz T-15 was at Salyut 7, the uncrewed Soyuz TM-1 arrived at the unoccupied &quot;Mir&quot; and remained for 9 days, testing the new Soyuz TM model. Soyuz T-15 redocked with &quot;Mir&quot; on 26 June and delivered the experiments and 20 instruments, including a multichannel spectrometer. The EO-1 crew spent their last 20 days on &quot;Mir&quot; conducting Earth observations before returning to Earth on 16 July 1986, leaving the new station unoccupied.

The second expedition to &quot;Mir&quot;, EO-2, launched on Soyuz TM-2 on 5 February 1987. During their stay, the &quot;Kvant&quot;-1 module, launched on 30 March 1987, arrived. It was the first experimental version of a planned series of &#x27;37K&#x27; modules scheduled to be launched to &quot;Mir&quot; on &quot;Buran&quot;. &quot;Kvant&quot;-1 was originally planned to dock with Salyut 7; due to technical problems during its development, it was reassigned to &quot;Mir&quot;. The module carried the first set of six gyroscopes for attitude control. The module also carried instruments for X-ray and ultraviolet astrophysical observations.

The initial rendezvous of the &quot;Kvant&quot;-1 module with &quot;Mir&quot; on 5 April 1987 was troubled by the failure of the onboard control system. After the failure of the second attempt to dock, the resident cosmonauts, Yuri Romanenko and Aleksandr Laveykin, conducted an EVA to fix the problem. They found a trash bag which had been left in orbit after the departure of one of the previous cargo ships and was now located between the module and the station, which prevented the docking. After removing the bag, docking was completed on 12 April.

The Soyuz TM-2 launch was the beginning of a string of 6 Soyuz launches and three long-duration crews between 5 February 1987 and 27 April 1989. This period also saw the first international visitors, Muhammed Faris (Syria), Abdul Ahad Mohmand (Afghanistan) and Jean-Loup Chrétien (France). With the departure of EO-4 on Soyuz TM-7 on 27 April 1989 the station was again left unoccupied.

====Third start====

The launch of Soyuz TM-8 on 5 September 1989 marked the beginning of the longest human presence in space, until 23 October 2010, when this record was surpassed by the ISS. It also marked the beginning of &quot;Mir&#x27;s&quot; second expansion. The Kvant-2 and &quot;Kristall&quot; modules were now ready for launch. Alexander Viktorenko and Aleksandr Serebrov docked with &quot;Mir&quot; and brought the station out of its five-month hibernation. On 29 September the cosmonauts installed equipment in the docking system in preparation for the arrival of &quot;Kvant&quot;-2, the first of the 20 tonne add-on modules based on the TKS spacecraft from the Almaz programme.
After a 40-day delay caused by faulty computer chips, &quot;Kvant&quot;-2 was launched on 26 November 1989. After problems deploying the craft&#x27;s solar array and with the automated docking systems on both &quot;Kvant&quot;-2 and &quot;Mir&quot;, the new module was docked manually on 6 December. &quot;Kvant&quot;-2 added a second set of control moment gyroscopes (CMGs, or &quot;gyrodynes&quot;) to &quot;Mir&quot;, and brought the new life support systems for recycling water and generating oxygen, reducing dependence on ground resupply. The module featured a large airlock with a one-metre hatch. A special backpack unit (known as &quot;Ikar&quot;), an equivalent of the US Manned Maneuvering Unit, was located inside &quot;Kvant&quot;-2&#x27;s airlock.

Soyuz TM-9 launched EO-6 crew members Anatoly Solovyev and Aleksandr Balandin on 11 February 1990. While docking, the EO-5 crew noted that three thermal blankets on the ferry were loose, potentially creating problems on reentry, but it was decided that they would be manageable. Their stay on board &quot;Mir&quot; saw the addition of the &quot;Kristall&quot; module, launched 31 May 1990. The first docking attempt on 6 June was aborted due to an attitude control thruster failure. &quot;Kristall&quot; arrived at the front port on 10 June and was relocated to the lateral port opposite &quot;Kvant&quot;-2 the next day, restoring the equilibrium of the complex. Due to the delay in the docking of &quot;Kristall&quot;, EO-6 was extended by 10 days to permit the activation of the module&#x27;s systems and to accommodate an EVA to repair the loose thermal blankets on Soyuz TM-9.

&quot;Kristall&quot; contained furnaces for use in producing crystals under microgravity conditions (hence the choice of name for the module). The module was also equipped with biotechnology research equipment, including a small greenhouse for plant cultivation experiments which was equipped with a source of light and a feeding system, in addition to equipment for astronomical observations. The most obvious features of the module were the two Androgynous Peripheral Attach System (APAS-89) docking ports designed to be compatible with the &quot;Buran&quot; spacecraft. Although they were never used in a &quot;Buran&quot; docking, they were useful later during the Shuttle-&quot;Mir&quot; programme, providing a berthing location for US Space Shuttles.

The EO-7 relief crew arrived aboard Soyuz TM-10 on 3 August 1990. The new crew arrived at &quot;Mir&quot; with quail for &quot;Kvant&quot;-2&#x27;s cages, one of which laid an egg en route to the station. It was returned to Earth, along with 130 kg of experiment results and industrial products, in Soyuz TM-9. Two more expeditions, EO-8 and EO-9, continued the work of their predecessors whilst tensions grew back on Earth.

====Post-Soviet period====

The EO-10 crew, launched aboard Soyuz TM-13 on 2 October 1991, was the last crew to launch from the USSR and continued the occupation of &quot;Mir&quot; during the fall of the Soviet Union. The crew launched as Soviet citizens and returned to Earth on 25 March 1992 as Russians. The newly formed Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos) was unable to finance the unlaunched &quot;Spektr&quot; and &quot;Priroda&quot; modules, instead putting them into storage and ending &quot;Mir&#x27;s&quot; second expansion.

The first human mission flown from an independent Kazakhstan was Soyuz TM-14, launched on 17 March 1992, which carried the EO-11 crew to &quot;Mir&quot;, docking on 19 March before the departure of Soyuz TM-13. On 17 June, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and US President George H. W. Bush announced what would later become the Shuttle-&quot;Mir&quot; programme, a cooperative venture which proved useful to the cash-strapped Roskosmos (and led to the eventual completion and launch of &quot;Spektr&quot; and &quot;Priroda&quot;). EO-12 followed in July, alongside a brief visit by French astronaut Michel Tognini. The following crew, EO-13, began preparations for the Shuttle-&quot;Mir&quot; programme by flying to the station in a modified spacecraft, Soyuz TM-16 (launched on 26 January 1993), which was equipped with an APAS-89 docking system rather than the usual probe-and-drogue, enabling it to dock to &quot;Kristall&quot; and test the port which would later be used by US Space Shuttles. The spacecraft also enabled controllers to obtain data on the dynamics of docking a spacecraft to a space station off the station&#x27;s longitudinal axis, in addition to data on the structural integrity of this configuration via a test called &quot;Rezonans&quot; conducted on 28 January. Soyuz TM-15, meanwhile, departed with the EO-12 crew on 1 February.

Throughout the period following the collapse of the USSR, crews on &quot;Mir&quot; experienced occasional reminders of the economic chaos occurring in Russia. The initial cancellation of &quot;Spektr&quot; and &quot;Priroda&quot; was the first such sign, followed by the reduction in communications as a result of the fleet of tracking ships being withdrawn from service by Ukraine. The new Ukrainian government also vastly raised the price of the &quot;Kurs&quot; docking systems, manufactured in Kyivthe Russians&#x27; attempts to reduce their dependence on &quot;Kurs&quot; would later lead to accidents during TORU tests in 1997. Various Progress spacecraft had parts of their cargoes missing, either because the consumable in question had been unavailable, or because the ground crews at Baikonur had looted them. The problems became particularly obvious during the launch of the EO-14 crew aboard Soyuz TM-17 in July; shortly before launch there was a black-out at the pad, and the power supply to the nearby city of Leninsk failed an hour after launch. Nevertheless, the spacecraft launched on time and arrived at the station two days later. All of &quot;Mir&quot;&#x27;s ports were occupied, and so Soyuz TM-17 had to station-keep 200 metres away from the station for half an hour before docking while Progress M-18 vacated the core module&#x27;s front port and departed.

The EO-13 crew departed on 22 July, and soon after &quot;Mir&quot; passed through the annual Perseid meteor shower, during which the station was hit by several particles. A spacewalk was conducted on 28 September to inspect the station&#x27;s hull, but no serious damage was reported. Soyuz TM-18 arrived on 10 January 1994 carrying the EO-15 crew (including Valeri Polyakov, who was to remain on &quot;Mir&quot; for 14 months), and Soyuz TM-17 left on 14 January. The undocking was unusual in that the spacecraft was to pass along &quot;Kristall&quot; in order to obtain photographs of the APAS to assist in the training of space shuttle pilots. Due to an error in setting up the control system, the spacecraft struck the station a glancing blow during the manoeuvre, scratching the exterior of &quot;Kristall&quot;.

On 3 February 1994, &quot;Mir&quot; veteran Sergei Krikalev became the first Russian cosmonaut to launch on a US spacecraft, flying on during STS-60.

The launch of Soyuz TM-19, carrying the EO-16 crew, was delayed due to the unavailability of a payload fairing for the booster that was to carry it, but the spacecraft eventually left Earth on 1 July 1994 and docked two days later. They stayed only four months to allow the Soyuz schedule to line up with the planned Space Shuttle manifest, and so Polyakov greeted a second resident crew in October, prior to the undocking of Soyuz TM-19, when the EO-17 crew arrived in Soyuz TM-20.

====Shuttle–&quot;Mir&quot;====

On 3 February 1995, the launch of , flying STS-63, opened operations on &quot;Mir&quot;. Referred to as the &quot;near-&quot;Mir&quot;&quot; mission, the mission saw the first rendezvous of a Space Shuttle with &quot;Mir&quot; as the orbiter approached within of the station as a dress rehearsal for later docking missions and for equipment testing. Five weeks after &quot;Discovery&quot; departure, the EO-18 crew, including the first US cosmonaut Norman Thagard, arrived in Soyuz TM-21. The EO-17 crew left a few days later, with Polyakov completing his record-breaking 437-day spaceflight. During EO-18, the &quot;Spektr&quot; science module (which served as living and working space for American astronauts) was launched aboard a Proton rocket and docked to the station, carrying research equipment from America and other nations. The expedition&#x27;s crew returned to Earth aboard following the first Shuttle–&quot;Mir&quot; docking mission, STS-71. &quot;Atlantis&quot;, launched on 27 June 1995, successfully docked with &quot;Mir&quot; on 29 June becoming the first US spacecraft to dock with a Russian spacecraft since the ASTP in 1975. The orbiter delivered the EO-19 crew and returned the EO-18 crew to Earth. The EO-20 crew were launched on 3 September, followed in November by the arrival of the docking module during STS-74.

On 21 February 1996, the two-man EO-21 crew was launched aboard Soyuz TM-23, and they were soon joined by US crew member Shannon Lucid, who was brought to the station by &quot;Atlantis&quot; during STS-76. During this mission, the first joint US spacewalk on &quot;Mir&quot; took place, deploying the Mir Environmental Effects Payload package for the docking module. Lucid became the first American to carry out a long-duration mission aboard &quot;Mir&quot; with her 188-day mission, which set the US single spaceflight record. During Lucid&#x27;s time aboard &quot;Mir&quot;, &quot;Priroda&quot;, the station&#x27;s final module, arrived as did French visitor Claudie Haigneré flying the &quot;Cassiopée&quot; mission. The flight aboard Soyuz TM-24 also delivered the EO-22 crew of Valery Korzun and Aleksandr Kaleri.

On 16 September 1996, with the launch of &quot;Atlantis&quot; and the STS-79 flight, Lucid&#x27;s stay aboard &quot;Mir&quot; ended. During this fourth docking, John Blaha transferred onto &quot;Mir&quot; to take his place as resident US astronaut. His stay on the station improved operations in a number of areas, including transfer procedures for a docked space shuttle, &quot;hand-over&quot; procedures for long-duration American crew members, and &quot;ham&quot; amateur radio communications, as well as two spacewalks to reconfigure the station&#x27;s power grid. Blaha spent four months with the EO-22 crew before returning to Earth aboard &quot;Atlantis&quot; on STS-81 in January 1997, at which point he was replaced by physician Jerry Linenger. During his flight, Linenger became the first American to conduct a spacewalk from a foreign space station and the first to test the Russian-built Orlan-M spacesuit alongside Russian cosmonaut Vasili Tsibliyev, flying EO-23. All three crew members of EO-23 performed a &quot;fly-around&quot; in Soyuz TM-25 spacecraft. Linenger and his Russian crewmates Vasili Tsibliyev and Aleksandr Lazutkin faced several difficulties during the mission, including the most severe fire aboard an orbiting spacecraft (caused by a malfunctioning &quot;Vika&quot;), failures of various systems, a near collision with Progress M-33 during a long-distance TORU test and a total loss of station electrical power. The power failure also caused a loss of attitude control, which led to an uncontrolled &quot;tumble&quot; through space.
Linenger was succeeded by Anglo-American astronaut Michael Foale, carried up by &quot;Atlantis&quot; on STS-84, alongside Russian mission specialist Elena Kondakova. Foale&#x27;s increment proceeded fairly normally until 25 June when during the second test of the &quot;Progress&quot; manual docking system, TORU, Progress M-34 collided with solar arrays on the &quot;Spektr&quot; module and crashed into the module&#x27;s outer shell, puncturing the module and causing depressurisation on the station. Only quick actions on the part of the crew, cutting cables leading to the module and closing &quot;Spektr&#x27;s&quot; hatch, prevented the crews having to abandon the station in Soyuz TM-25. Their efforts stabilised the station&#x27;s air pressure, whilst the pressure in &quot;Spektr&quot;, containing many of Foale&#x27;s experiments and personal effects, dropped to a vacuum. In an effort to restore some of the power and systems lost following the isolation of &quot;Spektr&quot; and to attempt to locate the leak, EO-24 commander Anatoly Solovyev and flight engineer Pavel Vinogradov carried out a risky salvage operation later in the flight, entering the empty module during a so-called &quot;intra-vehicular activity&quot; or &quot;IVA&quot; spacewalk and inspecting the condition of hardware and running cables through a special hatch from &quot;Spektr&#x27;s&quot; systems to the rest of the station. Following these first investigations, Foale and Solovyev conducted a 6-hour EVA outside &quot;Spektr&quot; to inspect the damage.

After these incidents, the US Congress and NASA considered whether to abandon the programme out of concern for the astronauts&#x27; safety, but NASA administrator Daniel Goldin decided to continue. The next flight to &quot;Mir&quot;, STS-86, carried David Wolf aboard &quot;Atlantis&quot;. During the orbiter&#x27;s stay, Titov and Parazynski conducted a spacewalk to affix a cap to the docking module for a future attempt by crew members to seal the leak in &quot;Spektr&quot;″s hull. Wolf spent 119 days aboard &quot;Mir&quot; with the EO-24 crew and was replaced during STS-89 with Andy Thomas, who carried out the last US expedition on &quot;Mir&quot;. The EO-25 crew arrived in Soyuz TM-27 in January 1998 before Thomas returned to Earth on the final Shuttle–&quot;Mir&quot; mission, STS-91.

====Final days and deorbit====
Following the 8 June 1998 departure of &quot;Discovery&quot;, the EO-25 crew of Budarin and Musabayev remained on &quot;Mir&quot;, completing materials experiments and compiling a station inventory. On 2 July, Roskosmos director Yuri Koptev announced that, due to a lack of funding to keep &quot;Mir&quot; active, the station would be deorbited in June 1999. The EO-26 crew of Gennady Padalka and Sergei Avdeyev arrived on 15 August in Soyuz TM-28, alongside physicist Yuri Baturin, who departed with the EO-25 crew on 25 August in Soyuz TM-27. The crew carried out two spacewalks, one inside &quot;Spektr&quot; to reseat some power cables and another outside to set up experiments delivered by Progress M-40, which also carried a large amount of propellant to begin alterations to &quot;Mir&quot;″s orbit in preparation for the station&#x27;s decommissioning. 20 November 1998 saw the launch of &quot;Zarya&quot;, the first module of the ISS, but delays to the new station&#x27;s service module &quot;Zvezda&quot; had led to calls for &quot;Mir&quot; to be kept in orbit past 1999. Roscosmos confirmed that it would not fund &quot;Mir&quot; past the set deorbit date.

The crew of EO-27, Viktor Afanasyev and Jean-Pierre Haigneré, arrived in Soyuz TM-29 on 22 February 1999 alongside Ivan Bella, who returned to Earth with Padalka in Soyuz TM-28. The crew carried out three EVAs to retrieve experiments and deploy a prototype communications antenna on &quot;Sofora&quot;. On 1 June it was announced that the deorbit of the station would be delayed by six months to allow time to seek alternative funding to keep the station operating. The rest of the expedition was spent preparing the station for its deorbit; a special analog computer was installed and each of the modules, starting with the docking module, was mothballed in turn and sealed off. The crew loaded their results into Soyuz TM-29 and departed &quot;Mir&quot; on 28 August 1999, ending a run of continuous occupation, which had lasted for eight days short of ten years. The station&#x27;s control moment gyroscopes (CMGs, or &quot;gyrodynes&quot;) and main computer were shut down on 7 September, leaving Progress M-42 to control &quot;Mir&quot; and refine the station&#x27;s orbital decay rate.

Near the end of its life, there were plans for private interests to purchase &quot;Mir&quot;, possibly for use as the first orbital television/movie studio. The privately funded Soyuz TM-30 mission by MirCorp, that was launched on 4 April 2000, carried two crew members, Sergei Zalyotin and Aleksandr Kaleri, to the station for two months to do repair work with the hope of proving that the station could be made safe. This was to be the last crewed mission to &quot;Mir&quot;—while Russia was optimistic about &quot;Mir&quot; future, its commitments to the ISS project left no funding to support the aging station.

&quot;Mir&quot;″s deorbit was carried out in three stages. The first stage involved waiting for atmospheric drag to reduce the station&#x27;s orbit to an average of . This began with the docking of Progress M1-5, a modified version of the Progress-M carrying 2.5 times more fuel in place of supplies. The second stage was the transfer of the station into a 165 × 220 km (103 × 137 mi) orbit. This was achieved with two burns of Progress M1-5&#x27;s control engines at 00:32 UTC and 02:01 UTC on 23 March 2001. After a two-orbit pause, the third and final stage of the deorbit began with the burn of Progress M1-5&#x27;s control engines and main engine at 05:08 UTC, lasting 22+ minutes. Atmospheric reentry (arbitrarily defined beginning at 100 km/60 mi AMSL) occurred at 05:44 UTC near Nadi, Fiji. Major destruction of the station began around 05:52 UTC and most of the unburned fragments fell into the South Pacific Ocean around 06:00 UTC.

===Visiting spacecraft===

&quot;Mir&quot; was primarily supported by the Russian Soyuz and Progress spacecraft and had two ports available for docking them. Initially, the fore and aft ports of the core module could be used for dockings, but following the permanent berthing of &quot;Kvant&quot;-1 to the aft port in 1987, the rear port of the new module took on this role from the core module&#x27;s aft port. Each port was equipped with the plumbing required for Progress cargo ferries to replace the station&#x27;s fluids and also the guidance systems needed to guide the spacecraft for docking. Two such systems were used on &quot;Mir&quot;; the rear ports of both the core module and &quot;Kvant&quot;-1 were equipped with both the Igla and Kurs systems, whilst the core module&#x27;s forward port featured only the newer Kurs.

Soyuz spacecraft provided personnel access to and from the station allowing for crew rotations and cargo return, and also functioned as a lifeboat for the station, allowing for a relatively quick return to Earth in the event of an emergency. Two models of Soyuz flew to &quot;Mir&quot;; Soyuz T-15 was the only Igla-equipped Soyuz-T to visit the station, whilst all other flights used the newer, Kurs-equipped Soyuz-TM. A total of 31 (30 crewed, 1 uncrewed) Soyuz spacecraft flew to the station over a fourteen-year period.

The uncrewed Progress cargo vehicles were only used to resupply the station, carrying a variety of cargoes including water, fuel, food and experimental equipment. The spacecraft were not equipped with reentry shielding and so, unlike their Soyuz counterparts, were incapable of surviving reentry. As a result, when its cargo had been unloaded, each Progress was refilled with rubbish, spent equipment and other waste which was destroyed, along with the Progress itself, on reentry. In order to facilitate cargo return, ten Progress flights carried &quot;Raduga&quot; capsules, which could return around 150 kg of experimental results to Earth automatically. &quot;Mir&quot; was visited by three separate models of Progress; the original 7K-TG variant equipped with Igla (18 flights), the Progress-M model equipped with Kurs (43 flights), and the modified Progress-M1 version (3 flights), which together flew a total of 64 resupply missions. Whilst the Progress spacecraft usually docked automatically without incident, the station was equipped with a remote manual docking system, TORU, in case problems were encountered during the automatic approaches. With TORU, cosmonauts could guide the spacecraft safely in to dock (with the exception of the catastrophic docking of Progress M-34, when the long-range use of the system resulted in the spacecraft striking the station, damaging &quot;Spektr&quot; and causing decompression).

In addition to the routine Soyuz and Progress flights, it was anticipated that &quot;Mir&quot; would also be the destination for flights by the Soviet &quot;Buran&quot; space shuttle, which was intended to deliver extra modules (based on the same &quot;37K&quot; bus as &quot;Kvant&quot;-1) and provide a much improved cargo return service to the station. &quot;Kristall&quot; carried two Androgynous Peripheral Attach System (APAS-89) docking ports designed to be compatible with the shuttle. One port was to be used for &quot;Buran&quot;; the other for the planned &quot;Pulsar&quot; X-2 telescope, also to be delivered by &quot;Buran&quot;. The cancellation of the &quot;Buran&quot; programme meant these capabilities were not realised until the 1990s when the ports were used instead by US Space Shuttles as part of the Shuttle-&quot;Mir&quot; programme (after testing by the specially modified Soyuz TM-16 in 1993). Initially, visiting Space Shuttle orbiters docked directly to &quot;Kristall&quot;, but this required the relocation of the module to ensure sufficient distance between the shuttle and &quot;Mir&quot;″s solar arrays. To eliminate the need to move the module and retract solar arrays for clearance issues, a Mir Docking Module was later added to the end of &quot;Kristall&quot;. The shuttles provided crew rotation of the American astronauts on station and carried cargo to and from the station, performing some of the largest transfers of cargo of the time. With a space shuttle docked to &quot;Mir&quot;, the temporary enlargements of living and working areas amounted to a complex that was the largest spacecraft in history at that time, with a combined mass of .

===Mission control centre===
&quot;Mir&quot; and its resupply missions were controlled from the Russian mission control centre () in Korolyov, near the RKK Energia plant. Referred to by its acronym ЦУП (&quot;TsUP&quot;), or simply as &#x27;Moscow&#x27;, the facility could process data from up to ten spacecraft in three separate control rooms, although each control room was dedicated to a single programme; one to &quot;Mir&quot;; one to &quot;Soyuz&quot;; and one to the Soviet space shuttle &quot;Buran&quot; (which was later converted for use with the ISS). The facility is now used to control the Russian Orbital Segment of the ISS. The flight control team were assigned roles similar to the system used by NASA at their mission control centre in Houston, including:
* The Flight Director, who provided policy guidance and communicated with the mission management team;
* The Flight Shift Director, who was responsible for real-time decisions within a set of flight rules;
* The Mission Deputy Shift Manager (MDSM) for the MCC was responsible for the control room&#x27;s consoles, computers and peripherals;
* The MDSM for Ground Control was responsible for communications;
* The MDSM for Crew Training was similar to NASA&#x27;s &#x27;capcom,&#x27; or capsule communicator; usually someone who had served as the &quot;Mir&quot; crew&#x27;s lead trainer.

===Unused equipment===
Three command and control modules were constructed for the &quot;Mir&quot; program. One was used in space; one remained in a Moscow warehouse as a source of repair parts if needed, and the third was sold to an educational and entertainment complex in the US in 1997. Tommy Bartlett Exploratory purchased the unit and had it shipped to Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, where it became the centrepiece of the complex&#x27;s Space Exploration wing.

===Safety aspects===

====Ageing systems and atmosphere====
In the later years of the programme, particularly during the Shuttle-&quot;Mir&quot; programme, &quot;Mir&quot; suffered from various systems failures. It had been designed for five years of use, but eventually flew for fifteen, and in the 1990s was showing its age, with frequent computer crashes, loss of power, uncontrolled tumbles through space and leaking pipes. Jerry Linenger in his book about his time on the facility says that the cooling system had developed tiny leaks too small and numerous to be repaired, that permitted the constant release of coolant. He says that it was especially noticeable after he had made a spacewalk and become used to the bottled air in his spacesuit. When he returned to the station and again began breathing the air inside &quot;Mir&quot;, he was shocked by the intensity of the smell and worried about the possible negative health effects of breathing such contaminated air.

Various breakdowns of the Elektron oxygen-generating system were a concern; they led crews to become increasingly reliant on the backup &quot;Vika&quot; solid-fuel oxygen generator (SFOG) systems, which led to a fire during the handover between EO-22 and EO-23. (see also ISS ECLSS)

====Accidents====

Several accidents occurred which threatened the station&#x27;s safety, such as the glancing collision between &quot;Kristall&quot; and Soyuz TM-17 during proximity operations in January 1994. The three most alarming incidents occurred during EO-23. The first was on 23 February 1997 during the handover period from EO-22 to EO-23, when a malfunction occurred in the backup &quot;Vika&quot; system, a chemical oxygen generator later known as solid-fuel oxygen generator (SFOG). The &quot;Vika&quot; malfunction led to a fire which burned for around 90 seconds (according to official sources at the TsUP; astronaut Jerry Linenger insists the fire burned for around 14 minutes), and produced large amounts of toxic smoke that filled the station for around 45 minutes. This forced the crew to don respirators, but some of the respirator masks initially worn were broken. Some of the fire extinguishers mounted on the walls of the newer modules were immovable.

The other two accidents concerned testing of the station&#x27;s TORU manual docking system to manually dock Progress M-33 and Progress M-34. The tests were to gauge the performance of long-distance docking and the feasibility of removal of the expensive &quot;Kurs&quot; automatic docking system from Progress spacecraft. Due to malfunctioning equipment, both tests failed, with Progress M-33 narrowly missing the station and Progress M-34 striking &quot;Spektr&quot; and puncturing the module, causing the station to depressurise and leading to &quot;Spektr&quot; being permanently sealed off. This in turn led to a power crisis aboard &quot;Mir&quot; as the module&#x27;s solar arrays produced a large proportion of the station&#x27;s electrical supply, causing the station to power down and begin to drift, requiring weeks of work to rectify before work could continue as normal.

====Radiation and orbital debris====

Without the protection of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, cosmonauts were exposed to higher levels of radiation from a steady flux of cosmic rays and trapped protons from the South Atlantic Anomaly. The station&#x27;s crews were exposed to an absorbed dose of about 5.2 cGy over the course of the Mir EO-18 expedition, producing an equivalent dose of 14.75 cSv, or 1133 μSv per day. This daily dose is approximately that received from natural background radiation on Earth in two years. The radiation environment of the station was not uniform; closer proximity to the station&#x27;s hull led to an increased radiation dose, and the strength of radiation shielding varied between modules; &quot;Kvant&quot;-2&#x27;s being better than the core module, for instance.

The increased radiation levels pose a higher risk of crews developing cancer, and can cause damage to the chromosomes of lymphocytes. These cells are central to the immune system and so any damage to them could contribute to the lowered immunity experienced by cosmonauts. Over time, in theory, lowered immunity results in the spread of infection between crew members, especially in such confined areas. To avoid this only healthy people were permitted aboard. Radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of cataracts in cosmonauts. Protective shielding and protective drugs may lower the risks to an acceptable level, but data is scarce and longer-term exposure will result in greater risks.

At the low altitudes at which &quot;Mir&quot; orbited there is a variety of space debris, consisting of everything from entire spent rocket stages and defunct satellites, to explosion fragments, paint flakes, slag from solid rocket motors, coolant released by RORSAT nuclear powered satellites, small needles, and many other objects. These objects, in addition to natural micrometeoroids, posed a threat to the station as they could puncture pressurised modules and cause damage to other parts of the station, such as the solar arrays. Micrometeoroids also posed a risk to spacewalking cosmonauts, as such objects could puncture their spacesuits, causing them to depressurise. Meteor showers in particular posed a risk, and, during such storms, the crews slept in their Soyuz ferries to facilitate an emergency evacuation should &quot;Mir&quot; be damaged.

<text>Noyon (; ; , Noviomagus of the Veromandui, then ) is a commune in the Oise department, Northern France.

==Geography==
Noyon lies on the river Oise, about northeast of Paris. The Oise Canal and the Canal du Nord pass through the commune. Noyon station is served by regional trains to Creil, Saint-Quentin, Compiègne and Paris.

==History==

The town was founded as Noviomagus (Celtic for &quot;New Field&quot; or &quot;Market&quot;). As several other cities shared the name, it was distinguished by specifying the people living in and around it. The town is mentioned in the Antonine Itinerary as being 27 Roman miles from Soissons and 34 Roman miles from Amiens, but d&#x27;Anville noted that the distance must be in error, Amiens being further and Soissons closer than indicated.

By the Middle Ages, the town&#x27;s Latin name had mutated to Noviomum. The town was strongly fortified; some sections of the Roman walls still remained in late antiquity. This may explain why, around the year 531, bishop Medardus moved his seat from Vermand in the Vermandois to Noyon. (Another option was to move his seat to Saint-Quentin but the wine produced in Noyon was thought to be much better than that produced in Saint-Quentin. Other explanations are that Medardus was born near the town, at Salency, or that the place is nearer to Soissons, which was one of the royal capitals of the Merovingians.) The bishop of Noyon was also bishop of Tournai from the seventh century until Tournai was raised to a separate diocese 1146.

The cathedral at Noyon was where Charlemagne was crowned as co-King of the Franks in 768, as was the first Capetian king, Hugh Capet in 987. In 859 the town was attacked by Vikings and the bishop, Immo, captured and killed. The town received a communal charter in 1108, which was later confirmed by Philip Augustus in 1223. In the twelfth century, the diocese of Noyon was raised to an ecclesiastical duchy in the peerage of France. The Romanesque cathedral was destroyed by fire in 1131, but soon replaced by the present cathedral, Notre-Dame de Noyon, constructed between 1145 and 1235, one of the earliest examples of Gothic architecture in France. The bishop&#x27;s library is a historic example of half-timbered construction.

By the Treaty of Noyon, signed on the 13 August 1516 between Francis I of France and emperor Charles V, France abandoned its claims to the Kingdom of Naples and received the Duchy of Milan in recompense. The treaty brought the War of the League of Cambrai— one stage of the Italian Wars— to a close. The Hôtel de Ville was completed in 1520.

During King Henry II&#x27;s Italian war in 1557, most of Noyon would be burned, in the midst of Philip II of Spain&#x27;s invasion of Picardy, before returning to their winter quarters in the Spanish Netherlands.

Near the end of the sixteenth century the town fell under Habsburg control, but Henry IV of France recaptured it. The Concordat of 1801 suppressed its bishopric. The town was occupied by the Germans during World War I and World War II and on both occasions suffered heavy damage.

<doc id="81345" wikidata="Q210593" url="?curid=81345" title="Luigi">
<text>Luigi (; ) is a character created by Japanese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto. Part of Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Mario&quot; franchise, he is a kind-hearted, cowardly Italian plumber, and the younger fraternal twin brother and sidekick of Mario. Like his brother, Luigi&#x27;s distinctive characteristics include his large nose and mustache, overalls, green hat, and high-pitched, exaggerated Italian accent.

Luigi first appeared in &quot;Mario Bros.&quot;, a 1983 platform game, in which he was originally designed as a palette swap of Mario with a green color scheme; Luigi has since appeared in multiple games and other media throughout the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise, in which developed a personality and style of his own. As his role in the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise progressed, Luigi evolved into a physically distinct character, and become the main protagonist of &quot;Mario is Missing!&quot; and the &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot; series. Charles Martinet voiced Luigi from 1992 to 2023, when he was succeeded by Kevin Afghani.

Luigi has appeared in over 200 video games. These include puzzle games such as &quot;Dr. Luigi&quot;, role-playing games such as &quot;Paper Mario&quot; and &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi&quot;, and sports games such as &quot;Mario Kart&quot; and &quot;Mario Tennis&quot;. Luigi has also appeared in other Nintendo properties, such as the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series of crossover fighting games. From March 2013 to March 2014, Nintendo called the period the Year of Luigi to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the character&#x27;s existence. Correspondingly, games released in 2013 emphasized Luigi. An unlockable Luigi-themed version of &quot;Mario Bros.&quot;, titled &quot;Luigi Bros.&quot;, was also included with &quot;Super Mario 3D World&quot;.

Luigi&#x27;s likeness has been featured in merchandise based on the &quot;Mario&quot; series, as well as comic books and television shows such as &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Super Show&quot;, in which he was portrayed by Danny Wells. He was also portrayed by John Leguizamo in the live-action film &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; (1993) and voiced by Charlie Day in the animated film &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot; (2023).

==Concept and creation==

Luigi&#x27;s creation began in 1982, during the development of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, where Shigeru Miyamoto had created Jumpman (later known as Mario), hoping that he would be able to recast the character in a variety of roles in future games. Miyamoto was inspired by &quot;Joust&quot; to create a game with a simultaneous two-player mode, which led to his development of the game &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; where Luigi was given the role of Mario&#x27;s brother as the second playable character, both Mario and Luigi were styled as Italian plumbers in &quot;Mario Bros.&quot;, on the suggestion of a colleague. 

It is currently unconfirmed how Luigi received his name, although there are many theories. &quot;New Straits Times&quot; noted that Miyamoto observed the Japanese word &quot;ruiji&quot; means &quot;similar&quot;, thus explaining the similarities of Luigi to Mario. Rus McLaughlin of &quot;IGN&quot; wrote that the theories from a rhyme on the Japanese word for &quot;analogous&quot; and a pizza parlor near Minoru Arakawa&#x27;s office called Mario &amp; Luigi&#x27;s were considered. Software constraints at the time of the respective game&#x27;s origins meant that Luigi&#x27;s first appearance was restricted to a simple palette swap.

After the success of &quot;Mario Bros.&quot;, Luigi was introduced to a wider audience in the 1985 video game &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, while &quot;Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels&quot;, marked the beginning of Luigi&#x27;s development toward becoming a more distinguished character. Luigi&#x27;s movement was no longer identical; he could now jump higher and farther than his brother, at the expense of movement response and precision. Consequently, In 1988, an alternative release was developed to serve as &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; for Western players (and later released in Japan as &quot;Super Mario USA&quot;); this version played a key role in shaping Luigi&#x27;s current appearance.

===Actor portrayal===
Much like his appearance, Luigi&#x27;s vocal portrayal has fluctuated over the years. &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot;, in which many characters were voiced for the first time, some characters, including Luigi, had two different voices; the North American and European versions of the game feature a low-pitched voice for Luigi, provided by Charles Martinet, who also voiced Mario, Wario, and Waluigi. The Japanese version uses a high-pitched, falsetto voice, provided by the then French translator at Nintendo, Julien Bardakoff. Inconsistent voice acting continued with many Nintendo 64 games; all versions of &quot;Mario Party&quot; feature Bardakoff&#x27;s high-pitched clips from &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot;.

Luigi retained this higher voice in &quot;Mario Party 2&quot;. In &quot;Mario Golf&quot;, &quot;Mario Tennis&quot;, and &quot;Mario Party 3&quot;, his voice returned to a lower state. Since then, with the exceptions of &quot;Mario Kart: Super Circuit&quot; and &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;, Luigi has consistently had a medium-pitched voice, performed by Martinet until 2023 and Kevin Afghani since 2023. In &quot;Mario Kart: Super Circuit&quot;, Luigi&#x27;s voice was the same high-pitched voice from the Japanese version of &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot;. In &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; and &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;, Luigi&#x27;s voice is made up of clips from Mario&#x27;s voice taken from &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, with raised pitches. In &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot;, &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U&quot;, and &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, he has his own voice (which is medium-pitched) instead of a pitched-up version of Mario&#x27;s. Luigi was voiced by Charlie Day in the 2023 film adaptation and was given a somewhat higher-pitched voice.

==Characteristics==
Luigi is portrayed as the taller, younger brother of Mario, and is usually seen dressed in a green shirt, dark blue overalls, and a green hat with a green &quot;L&quot; insignia. Although Luigi is a plumber like Mario, other facets of his personality vary from game to game; Luigi always seems nervous and timid, but is good-natured and can keep his temper better than his brother. A baby version of the character named Baby Luigi debuted in &quot;Super Mario World 2: Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot;, who is held captive by Kamek. He also appeared in &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi: Partners in Time&quot; as a playable character along with Baby Mario. He is voiced by Charles Martinet, just like his adult self. According to Miyamoto, Mario is 24 years old, indirectly confirming Luigi is 24 as well.

While it has not been made official, Daisy has been rumored to be Luigi&#x27;s romantic interest. In &quot;Mario Kart Wii&quot; they are seen in statue dancing together. She was his caddy in &quot;NES Open Tournament Golf&quot;, as Peach was to Mario. On Daisy&#x27;s trophy in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;, it says that she is possibly Luigi&#x27;s answer to Mario&#x27;s Peach. Nintendo did not initially give Luigi a surname. The first notable use of &quot;Luigi Mario&quot; was in the 1993 live-action film adaptation. In September 2015, at the &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; 30th Anniversary festival, Miyamoto stated that Mario&#x27;s full name was Mario Mario. As a result, this indirectly confirms Luigi&#x27;s full name to be Luigi Mario.

==Appearances==

Luigi&#x27;s first appearance was in the 1983 arcade game &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; as the character controlled by the second player. He retained this role in &quot;Wrecking Crew&quot;. He later appeared in &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; for the NES, and again in &quot;Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot;, and &quot;Super Mario World&quot;. &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; introduced Luigi as the taller of the two brothers, as well as the better jumper. &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot;, and &quot;Super Mario World&quot; returned to featuring Luigi as identical to Mario. He made a minor appearance in his baby form in &quot;Super Mario World 2: Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot;. Luigi was conspicuously absent in &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; and &quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot;. However, the Nintendo DS remake of &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; features him as a playable character alongside Mario, Yoshi, and Wario.

Luigi has been associated with the more difficult second acts of multiple &quot;Super Mario&quot; games. These include &quot;The Lost Levels&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Galaxy 2&quot;, &quot;New Super Luigi U&quot; and the new game plus in &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot;, which offer more challenging elaborations on their respective predecessors and allow the player to use Luigi as the main character, with whom reduced friction and higher jumping is consistent in all of these games. Luigi became playable in the Nintendo DS game &quot;New Super Mario Bros.&quot; as a hidden character, and as a hidden character in the Wii game &quot;Super Mario Galaxy&quot;. In its sequel, &quot;Super Mario Galaxy 2&quot;, the player can switch out for Luigi throughout the game. He also appears as a playable character in &quot;New Super Mario Bros. Wii&quot;, where four players can play at once cooperatively as Mario, Luigi, and two Toads. He also appears in &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; as a playable character as well as &quot;New Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; and &quot;New Super Mario Bros. U&quot;, the latter having a DLC mode, where he is the main character, called &quot;New Super Luigi U&quot;. It has levels altered to his specific play abilities, including higher jumping. The DLC is also available as a standalone retail version. Luigi also appeared in &quot;Super Mario 3D World&quot; along with his brother, Peach, Rosalina and Toad.

Luigi appears in many of the &quot;Mario&quot; spin-off games, including &quot;Mario Kart&quot;, &quot;Mario Party&quot;, and all of the &quot;Mario&quot; sports games. He also appears in all five installments of the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series; in the first three installments and &quot;Ultimate&quot;, he is an unlockable character. Luigi received his own starring role in the 2001 video game &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot;, where he wins a mansion from a contest he never entered, and saves Mario from King Boo. He reprised his role in the installments &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion: Dark Moon&quot; and &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion 3&quot;.

Luigi has appeared in every &quot;Mario&quot; role-playing games. While he originally made a cameo appearance in the end credits of &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot;, he appears more prominently in the &quot;Paper Mario&quot; series. He is a non-playable character in the original &quot;Paper Mario&quot;. In the sequel &quot;Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door&quot;, he appears yet again as a non-player character, going on a separate adventure from Mario&#x27;s. &quot;Super Paper Mario&quot; features him as a playable character after he is initially brainwashed into working for the antagonist under the name &quot;&quot;. In &quot;Paper Mario: Sticker Star&quot; and &quot;Paper Mario: Color Splash&quot;, Luigi plays a minor role and can be found in the background of certain levels for a coin reward. In &quot;Color Splash&quot;, Luigi appears at the end of the game driving a kart and helps Mario reach Bowser&#x27;s Castle. In &quot;Paper Mario: The Origami King&quot;, he once again helps Mario by retrieving the keys of Peach&#x27;s Castle himself. The &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi&quot; series features Luigi as a main protagonist; the events of the games focus on him and his brother Mario. He has appeared in all seven &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi&quot; games.

===Other media===

Luigi made an appearance in the 1986 film &quot;Super Mario Bros.: The Great Mission to Rescue Princess Peach!&quot; in which he was voiced by Yū Mizushima. He was not given his consistent color scheme, sporting a yellow shirt with a blue hat, and overalls. In the film, Luigi is a greedy character and even leaves Mario at one point to look for coins. He was also a little more serious, but less courageous than his brother Mario, who constantly daydreamed about Princess Peach. Luigi later made an appearance in the OVA &quot;Amada Anime Series: Super Mario Bros.&quot; released in 1989, in which the &quot;Mario&quot; characters portrayed in the story of Snow White. He appears at the end of the video to save Mario and Peach from the Wicked Queen, portrayed by Koopa.

Luigi regularly appeared in &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!&quot;, airing from 1989 to 1990, which cast Danny Wells as both his live-action portrayal and voice. Like his brother, Luigi&#x27;s voice actor changed in later cartoons, in his case to Tony Rosato. Even though he was not the starring character in the show, Luigi appeared in all 91 episodes of the three DiC &quot;Mario&quot; television animated series, in one of which his brother himself did not appear (&quot;Life&#x27;s Ruff&quot; from &quot;The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3&quot;).

Luigi played a different role in the &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; film, where he was portrayed by John Leguizamo. He is depicted as a more easy-going character in contrast to the cynical Mario, portrayed by Bob Hoskins. In the film, Luigi is not Mario&#x27;s twin, but is much younger to the point that Mario is said to have been like a surrogate father to him since their parents&#x27; deaths, and his romantic relationship with Daisy is one of the film&#x27;s main plot elements. Luigi appears in the 2023 film adaptation voiced by Charlie Day. Luigi, alongside his brother Mario, are residents of Brooklyn who recently began their own plumbing business. Both stumble upon a Pipe, and while Mario is transported to the Mushroom Kingdom, Luigi is transported to the Dark Land where he is captured by Bowser and his forces. He later reunites with Mario near the film&#x27;s climax to defeat Bowser.

== Reception ==
Allegra Frank of &quot;Polygon&quot; commented that the English manual for &quot;Mario Party&quot; described him as &quot;smarter than Mario&quot;, but since &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot;, Luigi has been defined by his wimpish persona, and due to being overshadowed by Mario, he &quot;has an inferiority complex unparalleled in gaming&quot;. &quot;Den of Geek&quot; writer David Crow thought Luigi was &quot;cooler&quot; than Mario because he &quot;jumps higher, runs faster&quot;, and particularly praised his appearance in the 1993 &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; movie as portrayed by John Leguizamo. Alex Siquig writing for &quot;The Ringer&quot; also felt that Luigi was unappreciated. He commented that Luigi has existed &quot;within the confines of Mario’s pixelated shadow since 1983&quot; but felt that he had successfully carved out his own personality making a relatable character that is more than just a palette swap for Mario.

==Legacy==
On March 19, 2013, Nintendo began the &quot;Year of Luigi&quot;. This included a year of Luigi-themed games like &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion: Dark Moon&quot;, &quot;Dr. Luigi&quot;, &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi: Dream Team&quot;, and &quot;New Super Luigi U&quot;. A &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot; statue was released on Club Nintendo. On March 19, 2014, the Year of Luigi ended.

In 2015, game designer Josh Millard released &quot;Ennuigi&quot; which relates the story of Luigi&#x27;s inability to come to terms with the lack of narrative in the original &quot;Super Mario Bros&quot;. In a Reddit thread, Millard commented that he enjoyed creating &quot;a recharacterization of Luigi as a guy who&#x27;s as legitimately confused and distressed by his strange life as you&#x27;d expect a person to be once removed from the bubble of cartoony context of the franchise.&quot;

<doc id="81361" wikidata="Q12379" url="?curid=81361" title="Mario">
<text>Mario (; ) is a character created by the Japanese game designer Shigeru Miyamoto. He is the star of the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise, a recurring character in the &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; franchise, and the mascot of the Japanese video game company Nintendo. Mario is an Italian plumber who lives in the Mushroom Kingdom with his younger twin brother, Luigi. Their adventures generally involve rescuing Princess Peach from the villain Bowser while using power-ups that give them different abilities. Mario&#x27;s distinctive characteristics include his large nose and mustache, overalls, red cap, and high-pitched, exaggerated Italian accent.

Mario debuted as the player character of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, a 1981 platform game. Miyamoto created Mario after he was unable to obtain the license to use Popeye as the protagonist. The graphical limitations of arcade hardware influenced Mario&#x27;s design, such as his nose, mustache, and overalls, and he was named after Nintendo of America&#x27;s landlord, Mario Segale. After &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, Mario starred in &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; (1983). Its 1985 Nintendo Entertainment System sequel, &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, began the successful &quot;Super Mario&quot; platformer series. Charles Martinet voiced Mario from 1991 to 2023, when he was succeeded by Kevin Afghani.

Mario has appeared in over 200 video games. These include puzzle games such as &quot;Dr. Mario&quot;, role-playing games such as &quot;Paper Mario&quot; and &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi&quot;, and sports games such as &quot;Mario Kart&quot; and &quot;Mario Tennis&quot;. He lacks a set personality and consistent profession, allowing him to take on many different roles across the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise. Mario is often accompanied by a large cast of supporting characters, including friends like Princess Daisy, Toad, and Yoshi and rivals like Bowser Jr., Donkey Kong, and Wario. Mario has also appeared in other Nintendo properties, such as the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series of crossover fighting games.

Mario is an established pop culture icon and is widely considered the most famous video game character in history. His likeness has been featured in merchandise, and people and places have been nicknamed after him. He inspired many video game characters, including Sega&#x27;s Sonic the Hedgehog, and unofficial media. The &quot;Mario&quot; franchise is the bestselling video game franchise of all time, with more than 800 million units sold worldwide. Mario has been adapted in various media; he was portrayed by Bob Hoskins in the live-action film &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; (1993) and voiced by Chris Pratt in the animated film &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot; (2023).

==Concept and creation==
Shigeru Miyamoto created Mario while developing &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; in an attempt to produce a successful video game for Nintendo; previous games, such as &quot;Sheriff,&quot; had not achieved the success of games such as Namco&#x27;s &quot;Pac-Man&quot;. Originally, Miyamoto wanted to create a game that used the 1930s characters Popeye, Bluto, and Olive Oyl. At the time, however, as Miyamoto was unable to acquire a license to use the characters (and would not until 1982 with &quot;Popeye&quot;), he ended up creating an unnamed player character, along with Donkey Kong and Lady (later known as Pauline).

In the early stages of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, Mario was drawn using pixel dots in a 16x16 grid. The focus of the game was to escape a maze, while Mario could not jump. However, Miyamoto soon introduced jumping capabilities for the player character, reasoning that &quot;If you had a barrel rolling towards you, what would you do?&quot; Continuing to draw from 1930s media, &quot;King Kong&quot; served as an inspiration, and Mario was set in New York City.

===Name===
Though the protagonist was unnamed in the Japanese release of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, he was named &quot;Jumpman&quot; in the game&#x27;s English instructions and &quot;little Mario&quot; in the sales brochure. Miyamoto envisioned a &quot;go-to&quot; character he could use in any game he developed if needed, albeit in cameo appearances as Miyamoto did not, at the time, expect the character to become singularly popular. To this end, he originally named the character &quot;Mr. Video&quot;, comparing what he intended for the character&#x27;s appearances in later games to the cameos that Alfred Hitchcock had done within his films. In retrospect, Miyamoto commented that if he had named Mario &quot;Mr. Video&quot;, Mario likely would have &quot;disappeared off the face of the Earth.&quot;

According to a widely circulated story, during the localization of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; for American audiences, Nintendo of America&#x27;s warehouse landlord, Mario Segale, confronted then-president Minoru Arakawa, demanding back rent. Following a heated argument in which the Nintendo employees eventually convinced Segale he would be paid, they opted to name the character in the game Mario after him. This story is contradicted by former Nintendo of America warehouse manager Don James, who stated in 2012 that he and Arakawa named the character after Segale as a joke because Segale was so reclusive that none of the employees had ever met him. James repeated this account in 2018. A friend of Segale commented: &quot;My direct understanding and perception is that Mario Segale doesn&#x27;t mind at all the fact that his name inspired such an iconic character, and that he shows humble pride in that fact in front of his grandchildren and close-knit adult circles.&quot;

While it is implied by the title of the &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; series, in a 1989 interview, his full name was stated not to be &quot;Mario Mario&quot;. The first notable use of &quot;Mario Mario&quot; was in the 1993 live-action film adaptation of the &quot;Super Mario&quot; series, and was further used in Prima&#x27;s official video game strategy guides, in 2000 for &quot;Mario Party 2&quot; and in 2003 for &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga&quot;. In 2012, after Mario voice actor Charles Martinet stated that the character&#x27;s name was, in fact, &quot;Mario Mario&quot; at San Diego Comic-Con, Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata said Mario had no last name, with which Miyamoto agreed the month after. Two months after Iwata&#x27;s death in July 2015, Miyamoto changed his stance, asserting at the Super Mario Bros. 30th Anniversary festival that Mario&#x27;s full name was indeed &quot;Mario Mario&quot;. Mario can also be referred to as &quot;Super Mario&quot; when he acquires the Super Mushroom power-up.

===Appearance and profession===
By Miyamoto&#x27;s own account, Mario&#x27;s profession was chosen to fit with the game design: since &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; takes place on a construction site, Mario was made into a carpenter; and when he appeared again in &quot;Mario Bros.&quot;, it was decided that he should be a plumber, because a lot of the game is situated in underground settings. Mario&#x27;s character design, particularly his large nose, draws on Western influences; once he became a plumber, Miyamoto decided to &quot;put him in New York&quot; and make him Italian, light-heartedly attributing Mario&#x27;s nationality to his mustache. Other sources have Mario&#x27;s profession chosen to be carpentry in an effort to depict the character as an ordinary hard worker, making it easier for players to identify with him. After a colleague suggested that Mario more closely resembled a plumber, Miyamoto changed Mario&#x27;s profession accordingly and developed &quot;Mario Bros.&quot;, featuring the character in the sewers of New York City.

Due to the graphical limitations of arcade hardware at the time, Miyamoto clothed the character in red overalls and a blue shirt to contrast against each other and the background, making the movements of his arms easily perceptible. A red cap was added to let Miyamoto avoid drawing the character&#x27;s hairstyle, forehead, and eyebrows, as well as to circumvent the issue of animating his hair as he jumped. To give distinctly human facial features with the limited graphical abilities, Miyamoto drew a large nose and a mustache, which avoided the need to draw a mouth and facial expressions. Omitting a mouth circumvented the problem of clearly separating the nose from the mouth with a limited number of pixels available.

Over time, Mario&#x27;s appearance has become more defined; blue eyes, white gloves, brown shoes, a red &quot;M&quot; in a white circle on the front of his hat and gold buttons on his overalls have been added. According to an interview, Japanese character designer Yōichi Kotabe, who worked on redesigning characters in &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; (1985), revealed that Mario&#x27;s M on his hat was originally the resemblance of McDonald&#x27;s logo; Kotabe later changed the design of M and straightened its lines to clearly distinguish the difference. The colors of his shirt and overalls were also reversed from a blue shirt with red overalls to a red shirt with blue overalls. Miyamoto attributed this process to the different development teams and artists for each game as well as advances in technology.

===Voice acting===
Mario was voiced by Charles Martinet from 1991 to 2023. When he crashed the audition, the directors were preparing to close for the night, already packing up when he arrived. He was prompted with &quot;an Italian plumber from Brooklyn&quot;; when he heard the phrase, he immediately thought of a stereotypical Italian accent with a voice similar to that of a mobster. He then assumed the voice would be too harsh for children, so he planned on using a voice of an older figure. However, according to Martinet, the audition for Mario was the only time where his thoughts crashed and he spoke complete nonsense. After he was prompted the character, he babbled the following in a soft and friendly voice instead:

The voice he chose was derived from another voice role he used to play the character Gremio from William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;. Martinet kept speaking with the voice until the audition tape ran out; the clip was the only tape sent back to Nintendo, and when the director called the company he said he &quot;found our Mario&quot;. For the following years he would use the voice for an attraction at trade shows: small tracking sensors were glued onto his face, and he would voice a 3D model of Mario&#x27;s head on a television while he remained hidden behind a curtain. When attendees would approach the screen, they could talk and interact with Mario. Due to the long shifts, Stevie Coyle was hired as a voice match to take over during breaks by Martinet&#x27;s suggestion. The attraction was successful and would be used for five years until Martinet was called by Miyamoto, requesting that he use the voice for a video game.

His first official video game voice role would be the CD rerelease of &quot;Mario Teaches Typing&quot; in 1994, but his first major voice acting role was &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;. He received instructions on the types of sound clips needed from Miyamoto, and Martinet appreciated the fun tone of the game and later called Miyamoto a genius. He would continue to voice other various &quot;Mario&quot; characters, such as Luigi, Wario, and Waluigi. His time in the studio recording voice clips consisted of &quot;45 takes of every sound [he] can think of&quot;, according to Martinet at a Q&amp;A in Canada. What time he gives vocals for the game varies, and according to him has ranged from three years before a game&#x27;s release to one week. The amount of clips varies as well, ranging from one hour of audio to 20. Martinet was recognized by the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; for the most roles performed with the same character, at the time one hundred, and is the most of any video game voice actor. As of January 2022, he has voiced Mario in over 150 games and has recorded 5 million audio files with the voice. In an interview, Martinet said he wants to continue voicing the character until he &quot;drops dead&quot;, or until he can no longer perform the voice accurately. In August 2023, Nintendo announced Martinet would be retiring from the voice role of Mario, though he would continue to promote the franchise as a &quot;Mario Ambassador&quot;, a brand ambassador position. Voice actor Kevin Afghani succeeded Martinet in &quot;Super Mario Bros. Wonder&quot; the following October.

==Characteristics==
Mario is depicted as a portly plumber who lives in the fictional land of the Mushroom Kingdom with Luigi, his younger, taller brother. The original &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; depicted Mario and Luigi as Italians in New York, with the television series and films specifying them as originating from the borough Brooklyn. Mario&#x27;s infancy, in which he was transported by a stork to the Mushroom Kingdom, was first depicted in &quot;Super Mario World 2: Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot;. In a 2005 interview, Miyamoto stated that Mario&#x27;s physical age was about 24–25 years old, and &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; stated that his birthday is October 11.

He wears a long-sleeved red shirt, a pair of blue overalls with yellow buttons, brown shoes, white gloves, and a red cap with a red &quot;M&quot; printed on a white circle. In &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, he wore a pair of red overalls, and a blue shirt. In &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, he wore a brown shirt with red overalls. He has blue eyes, and, like Luigi, has brown hair, and a dark brown or black mustache. This consistent difference in color is attributed to being a relic from designing the characters for their original platforms, wherein certain features were actively distinguished while others had to be curtailed due to technical limitations.

Mario&#x27;s occupation is plumbing, though in the original &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; games he is a carpenter. Mario has also assumed several other occupations: in the &quot;Dr. Mario&quot; series of puzzle games, which debuted in 1990, Mario is portrayed as a medical physician named &quot;Dr. Mario&quot;; in the Game Boy game &quot;Mario&#x27;s Picross&quot;, Mario is an archaeologist; in the &quot;Mario vs. Donkey Kong&quot; series, Mario is the president of a profitable toy-making company. Mario partakes in sports activities such as tennis and golf in &quot;Mario&quot; sports games, as well as kart racing in the &quot;Mario Kart&quot; series. In September 2017, Nintendo confirmed on their official Japanese profile for the character that Mario was no longer considered a plumber, but the statement was changed in March 2018. According to Nintendo, Mario has seven careers, which include plumber, doctor, racer, martial artist, basketball player, baseball player, and soccer player.

Nintendo&#x27;s characterization of Mario as a Brooklynite Italian-American has been described as an example of &quot;mukokuseki&quot;, or &quot;nationlessness&quot;, with &quot;roots across [the] three continents&quot; of Europe, North America, and Japan.

===Relationships===
Mario usually saves Princess Peach and the Mushroom Kingdom and purges antagonists, such as Bowser, from various areas; since his first game, Mario has usually had the role of saving the damsel in distress. Originally, he had to rescue his girlfriend Pauline in &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; (1981) from Donkey Kong. Despite being replaced as Mario&#x27;s love interest by Princess Peach in &quot;Super Mario Bros.,&quot; a redesigned Pauline that first appeared in &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; (1994) has reappeared in the &quot;Mario vs. Donkey Kong&quot; series, &quot;Super Mario Odyssey&quot; and the &quot;Mario Kart&quot; series as a friend of Mario. Mario reprises his role of saving Peach in the &quot;Super Mario&quot; series, but Mario himself was rescued by Peach in role-reversal in &quot;Super Princess Peach&quot;. Mario rescued Princess Daisy of Sarasaland in &quot;Super Mario Land&quot;, but Luigi has since been more linked to her; in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;, the text explaining Daisy states that &quot;After her appearance in &quot;Mario Golf&quot;, some gossips started portraying her as Luigi&#x27;s answer to Mario&#x27;s Peach.&quot;

Luigi is Mario&#x27;s younger fraternal twin brother, who is taller, slimmer, and can jump higher than him. He is a companion in the &quot;Mario&quot; games, and the character whom the second player controls in two-player sessions of many of the video games. Luigi has also occasionally rescued Mario as seen in &quot;Mario Is Missing!&quot; and the &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot; series. &quot;Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins&quot; for the Game Boy saw the arrival of Wario, Mario&#x27;s greedy and self-declared arch rival, who usually assumes the role of a main antagonist or an antihero. The dinosaur character Yoshi serves as Mario&#x27;s steed and sidekick in games such as &quot;Super Mario World&quot;. Toad is Mario&#x27;s trusted close friend, who gives him advice and supports him throughout his journey to rescue Princess Peach.

===Abilities===
During the development of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, Mario was known as . Jumping—both to facilitate level traversal and as an offensive move—is a common gameplay element in &quot;Mario&quot; games, especially the &quot;Super Mario&quot; series. By the time &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot; was released, jumping became such a signature act of Mario that the player was often tasked with jumping to prove to non-player characters that he was Mario. Mario&#x27;s most commonly portrayed form of attack is jumping to stomp on the heads of enemies, first used in &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; This jump-stomp move may entirely crush smaller enemies on the stage, and usually deal damage to larger ones, sometimes causing secondary effects. Subsequent games have elaborated on Mario&#x27;s jumping-related abilities. &quot;Super Mario World&quot; added the ability to spin-jump, which allows Mario to break blocks beneath him. In &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, Mario gains new jumping abilities such as a sideways somersault; a ground pound, which is a high-impact downward thrusting motion; and the &quot;Wall Kick&quot;, which propels him upwards by kicking off walls.

&quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; introduced the basic three power-ups that have become staples for the series, especially the 2D games – the Super Mushroom, a large red mushroom, which causes Mario to grow larger and be able to survive getting hit once; the Fire Flower, which allows Mario to throw fireballs; and the Super Star, which gives Mario temporary invincibility. These powers have appeared regularly throughout the series.

==In video games==
===&quot;Super Mario&quot; series===
Mario is the protagonist of the &quot;Super Mario&quot; series. Each game varies in its plot, but most of them have the ultimate goal of Mario rescuing Princess Peach after being kidnapped by Bowser. Mario explores a variety of locations, titled &quot;worlds&quot;, and along the way, he can collect items and defeat enemies. Most levels have an end goal, such as stars or flagpoles, that he needs to reach to move on to the next. The series is divided into two general sets of games: the 2D side-scrolling &quot;Super Mario&quot; games and the 3D open world &quot;Super Mario&quot; games.

====2D games====
The &quot;Super Mario&quot; series had Mario starring in platform games, beginning with &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1985. In these games, Mario traverses worlds that contain a set number of levels for Mario to complete. In them, he traverses them from moving left to right, the screen scrolling in the direction he moves. Mario has the goal of reaching the end of the level to move onto the next, typically marked with a flagpole. These games are less focused on plot and more on platforming; most commonly, Bowser kidnaps Peach, and Mario, with the help of Luigi and other characters, sets out to rescue her. Most worlds have mini boss battles, which typically involve fighting Bowser Jr. or one of several Koopalings. The final level is a fight against Bowser.
His first appearance in the 2D variant of the series was &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; in 1985, which began with a 16x32 pixel rectangle prototype as the character; Takashi Tezuka suggested the character to be Mario after the success of one of his previous roles, &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; Certain other gameplay concepts were cut as well, such as how Mario could fly in a rocket ship and fire bullets. Originally designed with a small Mario in mind with the intention of increasing his size further in development, the developers implemented the feature of his size changes via power-ups as they considered it a fun addition. The concept was influenced by Japanese folktales.

&quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; was originally not going to be a sequel to &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, and was originally going to be a game called &quot;Doki Doki Panic&quot;; directed by Kensuke Tanabe. One of the changes included the retexturing of the four main playable characters of &quot;Doki Doki Panic&quot;, and since they varied in height, this was the first instance where Mario was noticeably shorter than Luigi. &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; experimented with Mario&#x27;s looks with different power-ups that represented different creatures. An example included the raccoon tail, which was chosen over a power-up that represented a centaur. The game&#x27;s success led to an animated television series, &quot;The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3&quot;, with Mario being portrayed by Walker Boone.

Hiroshi Yamauchi wanted a launch game for the Game Boy that featured Mario, as he believed in the statement &quot;fun games sold consoles&quot;. &quot;Super Mario Land&quot; was designed without the help of Miyamoto, a first for the series. The game uses completely different elements to pair with the small screen due to the Game Boy&#x27;s portability. For example, instead of rescuing Princess Peach from Bowser in the Mushroom Kingdom, Mario is instead rescuing Princess Daisy from Tatanga in Sarasaland. Mario was designed with line art.

&quot;Super Mario World&quot; was the first video game to feature Yoshi as a companion to Mario. Miyamoto had always wanted a dinosaur-like companion, ever since the original &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, but the concept was never achievable due to limited hardware. Since &quot;Super Mario World&quot; took place in a land of dinosaurs, Takashi Tezuka requested Shigefumi Hino to draw a character based on Miyamoto&#x27;s concepts and sketches, which he drew during the development of &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot;. &quot;Super Mario World&quot; was released during a console war between Nintendo and Sega; Sega&#x27;s mascot, Sonic the Hedgehog, was considered a &quot;cooler&quot; alternative to Mario, to which Miyamoto apologized for.

The plot for &quot;Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins&quot; has Mario pursue something for his own benefit rather than for someone else, his goal trying to reclaim ownership of his island, Mario Land, from Wario. The game was developed by Nintendo Research &amp; Development 1 (R&amp;D1). The company was unmotivated by the &quot;Super Mario&quot; series, and when they were tasked with creating a &quot;Super Mario&quot; game without Miyamoto, they created Wario to emphasize the frustration of working with a character they did not make. The name &quot;Wario&quot; is word play of &quot;Mario&quot; and &quot;Warui&quot;, the latter meaning &quot;bad&quot; in Japanese to mean &quot;bad Mario&quot;.

The character&#x27;s models and backgrounds in &quot;New Super Mario Bros.&quot; were 3D, but still only allowed for left and right movement and are considered 2.5D. With the 2D series of &quot;Super Mario&quot; games being absent for 14 years, the previous installment being released in 1992, game mechanics improved drastically. Since the characters were no longer sprites and the backdrops were not tile-based, the developers were nearly restrictionless; new game mechanics, such as Mario teetering off of trees and swinging on ropes, were implemented. &quot;New Super Mario Bros.&quot; was the first 2D &quot;Super Mario&quot; game to use voice acting, with Charles Martinet voicing Mario and Luigi. It was followed by three games similar to &quot;New Super Mario Bros.&quot;, namely &quot;New Super Mario Bros. Wii&quot;, &quot;New Super Mario Bros. 2&quot;, and &quot;New Super Mario Bros. U&quot;, the latter of which being the first game to feature Mario in high-definition graphics (HD).

Takashi Tezuka returned as a producer for the development of &quot;Super Mario Bros. Wonder&quot;, with Shiro Mouri as the director of the game. The game director, Shiro Mouri, said that the game developers aimed to provide a &quot;stress free&quot; experience to the players by allowing them to move freely through the course. In comparison to the previous 2D Super Mario games, Mario&#x27;s facial expressions are now more detailed and expressive.

====3D games====
Most &quot;Super Mario&quot; games in 3D feature open world gameplay; instead of being confined to only moving left and right, Mario can move in any direction, and the player can complete the level however they please. The player chooses from one of the multiple objectives before entering a level, and Mario is tasked with completing that goal, which ultimately ends with an obtainable item such as a star. These games feature a more complex narrative, but most still have Mario rescuing a kidnapped Princess Peach from Bowser.

Mario&#x27;s debut 3D role was in &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;; since the concept of 3D video games was still new at the time, the developers knew they were helping to pave the way for future games, and they were not restricted on what the standard game was like. However, when Yoshiaki Koizumi had to create a 3D model and animation of Mario, he had no frame of reference and struggled with the task. Koizumi stated how the whole concept was &quot;arguably tough&quot;, but was overtaken by the enjoyment of innovating in a new field. Mario&#x27;s movement was among the top priorities in the game&#x27;s development, with his animation being tested long before the basic layout of the game&#x27;s locations was in place. &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; was one of the first games voiced by Charles Martinet, and Mario&#x27;s character model was made with the N-World toolkit. Mario&#x27;s movements and animations were inspired by &quot;Arale Norimaki&quot; from &quot;Dr. Slump&quot;, a Japanese manga series.

&quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot; was the first Nintendo game released after Satoru Iwata became the CEO of Nintendo, succeeding Hiroshi Yamauchi. The game&#x27;s original concept did not feature Mario, as the developers believed the role was too out of the ordinary for such a character. Later on, when they used a generic man for the role instead, they believed having a realistic person alongside a character like Mario would cause &quot;incongruity&quot;, and it was ultimately changed to Mario instead. Mario&#x27;s ally, F.L.U.D.D., was one of ten design options but was chosen because it fit the game&#x27;s theme, although it was not their favorite option in terms of looks.

&quot;Super Mario Galaxy&quot; had Mario exploring a number of spherical planets, which the developers at the time knew simply jumping on enemies would be difficult to perform. They instead took advantage of the Wii Remote and Nunchuk having motion controls, and gave Mario a &quot;spin&quot; attack where he knocked over the enemies via spinning. To also balance the game&#x27;s difficulty, Mario was given fewer hit points.

To create a sense of familiarity for &quot;Super Mario Odyssey&quot;, various references to the &quot;Super Mario&quot; series were put in the game&#x27;s environment. For example, Pauline was chosen to be a major aspect of the &quot;Metro Kingdom&quot; due to the kingdom representing the core of the game. Mario was also given a variety of costumes to represent other smaller games, such as the &quot;Mario&#x27;s Picross&quot; series. The development team found the most fun way to use the Joy-Con controllers&#x27; motion controls was to throw a hat, and the gameplay was centered around Mario throwing his cap.

====Other &quot;Super Mario&quot; games====
There have also been a variety of &quot;Super Mario&quot; games starring Mario that do not have typical 2D or 3D platforming. The &quot;Super Mario 3D&quot; series does have 3D gameplay, but the stages are linear and do not allow for open-world movement. The &quot;Super Mario Maker&quot; games are a series of game creation systems where the player can create their own 2D &quot;Super Mario&quot; levels and play ones created by others. &quot;Super Mario Run&quot; is a 2D platforming mobile game with other unnatural gameplay aspects.

The main aspect of &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; was bridging the aspects of 2D and 3D &quot;Super Mario&quot; games. One of the issues brought up was how Mario looked too small in comparison to the large terrain and the small, portable screen of the Nintendo 3DS, so the game&#x27;s camera system needed to be fixed to one position in certain occasions. The game brought with it the &quot;Tanooki Tail&quot; power-up, which was originally introduced in &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot;, and its existence was teased by the developers to the fans prior to its official announcement. Concepts for Mario, which included a skater outfit and a power-up that would make Mario grow to a large size, were cut; the latter would appear in its sequel as the Mega Mushroom.

&quot;Super Mario 3D World&quot; on the Wii U included the &quot;Cat Mario&quot; power-up, which was implemented to help newcomers play the game and add new gameplay features such as climbing up walls. Another power-up was the &quot;Double Cherry&quot;, which was added accidentally; one of the developers added a second Mario into the game in error, and found it humorous when both Marios were somehow controllable at the same time. In 2020, also as part of the &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; 35th anniversary, Nintendo re-released &quot;Super Mario 3D World&quot; on the Nintendo Switch with a companion game, &quot;Bowser&#x27;s Fury&quot;.

===Other &quot;Mario&quot; games===
While the most prominent use of Mario has been directed toward the &quot;Super Mario&quot; series, various spinoff series that split into numerous games covering various genres have also been released. This includes genres such as role-playing games (RPGs), puzzle games, sports games, and even educational games in the 1990s.

====RPGs====

Mario has been the protagonist of various role-playing video games (RPGs), beginning with Square&#x27;s &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot; on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). According to Yoshio Hongo of Nintendo, the game came out of Shigeru Miyamoto&#x27;s desire to develop a &quot;Mario&quot; role-playing game while Square wanted a role-playing video game that sold well overseas. The game was notable at the time for having a unique blend of action and role-playing game elements, and was a critical and commercial success, and led to two other spinoff RPG series starring the character, &quot;Paper Mario&quot; and &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi&quot;.

A sequel to &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot; was planned for the Nintendo 64. The original developer, Square, had signed a deal with Sony to release &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; for the PlayStation, so Nintendo passed on development responsibilities to Intelligent Systems. The new art designer, Naohiko Aoyama, changed every character to two-dimensional to bring out &quot;cuter&quot; graphics compared to low-polygon three-dimensional graphics on the console. In the &quot;Paper Mario&quot; games, Mario is often aided by numerous allies who progress the story while Mario remains silent.

Unlike &quot;Paper Mario&quot;, both Mario and Luigi have voices in the &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi&quot; series and are voiced by Charles Martinet. According to the developers, the early games used character sprites; the developers were generally inexperienced and did not know much about hardware at the time. Once the Nintendo 3DS was released, the developers had the chance to switch to 3-dimensional graphics. They decided to change the background and world design but chose to keep the characters as 2D renderings of 3D characters as they believed it made it easier to convey comedic expressions. In 2013, they believed Mario took too much of the spotlight in the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise, and they made Luigi the more story-focused character in &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi: Dream Team&quot;.

====Sports games====

Nintendo has released a variety of sports games featuring &quot;Super Mario&quot; properties, which include tennis, golf, baseball, soccer, kart racing, and other miscellaneous.

In the 1984 video game &quot;Golf&quot;, although one of the two playable characters looks similar to that of him, wearing red clothes and black pants, he is never directly referred to be Mario; In 1997, his look was changed in the re-release of the Famicom Disk System to that more like the character, and Nintendo later confirmed the character was Mario in a guide book of the game in 1991, marking his first sports video game appearance. He then directly appeared in &quot;NES Open Tournament Golf&quot; in 1991 as one of two playable characters, the other being Luigi, along with a variety of other &quot;Mario&quot; characters with supporting roles. The character sprites were designed by Eiji Aonuma, his first project in graphical art design.

&quot;Mario&#x27;s Tennis&quot; for the Virtual Boy was the first tennis game featuring Mario. Camelot Software Planning, who previously developed &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Golf&quot; for Sony, was contracted to develop &quot;Mario Tennis&quot; for the Nintendo 64. Each character had a unique ability, with Mario having an all-around average set of skills to pair with his type of character. This would eventually set the stage for future &quot;Mario Tennis&quot; video games.

The &quot;Mario Kart&quot; series began with &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992; early in development, the game did not have any &quot;Mario&quot;-themed elements. A few months into the process, the designers were testing how one character would look at another they had just passed. They implemented Mario, simply to see how he would look inside a kart, and the original concept was scrapped entirely after they decided he looked better than the previous non-defined characters. Similar to the &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi&quot; series, he appears as a sprite that turns in 16 different angles. 

&quot;Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games&quot; is a crossover series of party and sports games featuring characters from the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise and the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series. It includes different varieties of sports such as skateboarding, fencing, volleyball, gymnastics, and many others.

====Puzzle games====

Mario has also starred in a variety of multiple puzzle games, but sometimes only makes an appearance and is not playable. The first of which to release was &quot;Wrecking Crew&quot;, designed by Yoshio Sakamoto. Surprisingly, in this game, Mario can&#x27;t jump because of hammer&#x27;s weight. After which, three main series and a variety of spin-offs were released starring him, including &quot;Dr. Mario&quot;, &quot;Mario vs. Donkey Kong&quot;, and &quot;Mario Picross&quot;.

The original game in the &quot;Dr. Mario&quot; series, also titled &quot;Dr. Mario&quot;, was designed by Takahiro Harada and had Mario assume the role of a doctor instead of a plumber. His appearance and role have generally remained the same; to celebrate his 30th anniversary in the series, an 8-bit rendering of his original appearance was made unlockable in the most recent game, &quot;Dr. Mario World&quot;. &quot;Mario vs. Donkey Kong&quot; is centered around &quot;Mini Marios&quot;, wind-up toys that resemble Mario. The &quot;Mario&#x27;s Picross&quot; series was an attempt by Nintendo to capitalize on the popularity of Mario and the success of puzzle games in Japan at the time. Released in 1995, the game was popular and was followed by two sequels, &quot;Super Mario Picross&quot; and &quot;Picross 2&quot;, but the first game was only made available to American audiences in 2020.

Due to the abandonment of the SNES-CD hardware in the 1990s, a project developed by Nintendo and Phillips, as part of Nintendo&#x27;s dissolving agreement with Philips, they gave the licensing rights to &quot;Mario&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; property to release games on the CD-i. Multiple games were developed by the inexperienced Fantasy Factory, which included the puzzle game &quot;Hotel Mario&quot; in 1994. Via Animation Magic, &quot;Hotel Mario&quot; had various cutscenes of Mario and Luigi, which borrowed animation elements from Disney and J. R. R. Tolkien. Mario was voiced by Marc Graue as the game was released prior to Charles Martinet receiving the role of voicing the character.

====Educational games====

Due to the popularity of the &quot;Super Mario&quot; series, various educational games starring the character were released and appealed to younger audiences. These games had little involvement from Nintendo, with the games releasing for the NES, Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), and personal computers. The last of the genres to release was &quot;Mario Teaches Typing 2&quot; in 1997, before the production of such games was discontinued.

&quot;Mario is Missing!&quot; is one of the only occasions where Mario himself was kidnapped and rescued by another character. In the game, Mario and Luigi approach Bowser to stop his plans, but Mario is then captured; Luigi traverses real-world locations to follow after him, solving trivia along the way. A similar game was released without the help of Miyamoto, &quot;Mario&#x27;s Time Machine&quot;, which starred Mario against Bowser instead. &quot;Mario&#x27;s Game Gallery&quot; has the player competing in various card and board games against Mario. The game was Charles Martinet&#x27;s first official voice acting role for Mario, one year prior to &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;.

For &quot;Mario Teaches Typing&quot;, the head of Interplay Productions, Brian Fargo, saw the success of the typing game &quot;Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing&quot;, and knew a character like Mario as the teacher would be appealing. Pre-dating &quot;Mario&#x27;s Game Gallery&quot;, Martinet did not voice Mario. After release, the concept was so successful, it began a negative relationship between Fargo and Les Crane, the creator of &quot;Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing&quot;. &quot;Mario Teaches Typing 2&quot; was released in 1997, which Martinet voiced Mario for. When they were approved of creating &quot;Mario&#x27;s Game Gallery&quot;, another Mario-themed education game was also released that was of poor quality, so Miyamoto met with Fargo and halted production of any further education games using the character.

===Cameos===
Apart from his platformer and spin-off game appearances, Mario has made guest appearances in other Nintendo games, such as &quot;Mike Tyson&#x27;s Punch-Out!!&quot; and &quot;Tennis&quot; (1984), where Mario is an umpire, in &quot;Pac-Man Vs.&quot;, he is the in-game announcer. Mario appears alongside Pauline in a bonus segment in &quot;Pinball&quot; (1984). He also appears as a playable character in every installment of the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series. He makes countless cameo appearances in many forms in many games, such as portraits and statues in &quot;The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot;, &quot;Pilotwings 64&quot;, and &quot;Stunt Race FX&quot;. Mario has a cameo appearance in &quot;Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy&#x27;s Kong Quest&quot;, despite having next to no presence in the &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; subseries. He can be seen in a crowd along with Luigi in &quot;Kirby Super Star&quot;. On an ending screen that appears in Nintendo&#x27;s NES version of the video game &quot;Tetris&quot;, Mario appears with Luigi dancing to the music, which is a version from prelude to the opera &quot;Carmen&quot;; Peach, Bowser and various Nintendo characters also appear. 

Outside of Nintendo-produced games, Mario has often appeared in third-party games on Nintendo consoles. Mario appears in &quot;Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes&quot; as a figurine alongside Yoshi. Mario appears as a playable character in the GameCube versions of &quot;NBA Street V3&quot; and &quot;SSX on Tour&quot;. Mario also appeared in &quot;Minecraft&quot; as a skin alongside other characters in the series. &quot;Monster Hunter 4&quot; included Mario as one of the free DLC outfits alongside Luigi. The Wii U version of &quot;Scribblenauts Unlimited&quot; features Mario along with other &quot;Super Mario&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; characters; they are not present in the 3DS version of the game. In December 2011, Ubisoft &quot;Just Dance 3&quot; included &quot;Mario&quot; as a downloadable dance track, with Mario appearing to dance on-screen.

==In other media==

The first appearance of Mario in media other than games was &quot;Saturday Supercade&quot;, an animated television series produced by Ruby-Spears Productions in 1983. The 1986 original video animation &quot;Super Mario Bros.: The Great Mission to Rescue Princess Peach!&quot; features Mario (voiced by Toru Furuya) as the protagonist. The animated series &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!&quot; features a live-action series of skits that stars former WWF manager &quot;Captain&quot; Lou Albano as Mario and Danny Wells as Luigi. Mario appeared in a book series, the Nintendo Adventure Books. The other two animated series, &quot;The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; and &quot;Super Mario World&quot;, star Walker Boone as Mario and Tony Rosato as Luigi.

Mario is portrayed by Bob Hoskins in the 1993 film loosely based on the &quot;Super Mario&quot; series, &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; In the film, he is the cynical older brother who takes great pride in being a plumber and is a parental figure to Luigi, portrayed by John Leguizamo. At first, he held no belief in unusual things happening, but meeting Daisy and taking a trip to Dinohattan soon changed his mind. Hoskins was ultimately cast to play the character after other choices fell out, such as Dustin Hoffman and Danny DeVito. Hoskins had previously done multiple roles in children&#x27;s films and kept suggesting changes to the script before he agreed to portray the character. According to one of the films&#x27; directors, Annabel Jankel, Hoskins was mainly considered due to his physical appearances. In subsequent interviews, Hoskins considered the role his worst choice in his acting career, admitted to constantly drinking before and during filming, and noted that he was injured and almost died multiple times during production.

Mario is voiced by Chris Pratt in the 2023 film adaptation &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot;. Although American actor Sebastian Maniscalco originally auditioned to voice Mario in the 2023 film, he got the role of voicing Spike instead. The film depicts him and Luigi as Italian-American plumbers who started their own business in Brooklyn after working for the antagonistic Foreman Spike, who supervises the Wrecking Crew. They attempt to fix a significant manhole leak reported in the news to make a name for themselves, only for the pipe to transport Mario to the Mushroom Kingdom and Luigi to the Dark Lands. Mario works with Peach, Toad, and later Donkey Kong to rescue Luigi and the Mushroom Kingdom from the tyrannical Bowser. Martinet makes cameo appearances in the film as Mario and Luigi&#x27;s unnamed father and as Giuseppe, who appears in Brooklyn and resembles Mario&#x27;s original design from &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, speaking in his in-game voice. In response to criticism of Pratt&#x27;s casting, co-director Aaron Horvath explained that he was cast mainly because of his history of playing good-natured, blue collar-type protagonists.

==Reception==

As Nintendo&#x27;s mascot, Mario is widely considered to be the most famous video game character in history, and has been called an icon of the gaming industry. He has been featured in over two hundred video games. Mario was one of the first video game character inductees at the Walk of Game in 2005, alongside Link and Sonic the Hedgehog. Mario was the first video game character to be honored with a wax figure in the Hollywood Wax Museum in 2003. &quot;Kotaku&quot; writer Luke Plunkett had called Mario the most recognizable figure in the gaming industry, stating that, &quot;Nintendo&#x27;s mascot has been the most recognisable (and profitable) face this industry has ever - and will likely ever - see, almost single-handedly driving Nintendo through five whole generations of video game success&quot;. In 2010, &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; gave Mario the title &quot;Godfather of gaming&quot; and &quot;longest-running computer game character&quot; and stated, &quot;Mario is still &#x27;The Godfather&#x27; of gaming as the most successful and enduring character in an industry which is constantly evolving.&quot; In 2024, a poll conducted by BAFTA with around 4,000 respondents named Mario as the second most iconic video-game character of all time. Ben Lindbergh of The Ringer described Mario as &quot;the most iconic video character of all time&quot;, &quot;the medium&#x27;s most successful character&quot;, and &quot;video-game-character equivalent of type-O blood&quot; and also reported that Mario has the highest Q Score among video game characters, with Link, Pac-Man, and Master Chief being one of his closest competitors. Lucas M. Thomas of &quot;IGN&quot; defined Mario as &quot;gaming&#x27;s greatest athlete&quot;, noting, &quot;He&#x27;s too short, he&#x27;s out of shape and he&#x27;s wearing entirely the wrong kind of shoes, but somehow Nintendo&#x27;s main man Mario has still managed to become gaming&#x27;s greatest athlete. From the tennis court to the ballpark, from the soccer field to the golf course, the heroic plumber has spent years now filling the time in-between his princess-rescuing adventures with a grand variety of leisurely sports&quot;.

In 1990, a national survey found that Mario was more recognizable to American children than Mickey Mouse. James Coates of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; reported that, as author David Sheff notes, &quot;In 1990, according to ‘Q’ ratings, Mario has become more popular than Mickey Mouse with American children&quot; and he further mentions that his 9-year-old son is a Nintendo fan who is curious about what Mario is doing to the youth of America. In 2005, American musician Jonathan Mann created an opera based on Super Mario Bros. and performed Mario Opera as a tribute to Shigeru Miyamoto. Salman Rushdie, an Indian-born British-American novelist, was fond of Mario and his younger twin brother &quot;Luigi&quot;. He also enjoyed playing &quot;Super Mario World&quot;, which gave him the impression of having an enjoyment of life in comparison to the rest of the world. In 2023, a survey was taken by gaming website Cribbage Online on &quot;Top 20 most-loved &quot;Super Mario&quot; franchise characters&quot;, which consisted of over 87,000 voters. According to the survey, Mario was placed third with 5,602 votes, while Luigi and &quot;Yoshi&quot; surpassed him with 5,771 votes and 6,084 votes, respectively.

Cameron Sherrill of &quot;Esquire&quot; praised Mario&#x27;s athletic skills in track and field, noting, &quot;This is where Mario comes to life. I mean, he goes against the blue guy who&#x27;s literally famous for going fast. Plus, Mario is the platforming king—i.e. running and jumping—so it stands to reason that he’d be good at track and field&quot;. Philip Kollar and Allegra Frank of Polygon wrote in their review of &quot;Super Mario Odyssey&quot; that Mario plays an important role in making the game more pleasurable and special. They also wrote about Mario&#x27;s legacy, stating that, &quot;From a plumber to a doctor to a tennis star to, uh, a Goomba, Mario has endured. No, this will not be the last Mario game, but it is almost certain to be lauded as one of his best&quot;. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave Mario their &quot;Coolest Mascot&quot; award for 1996, calling him &quot;an age-old friend&quot;. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; listed Mario as their favorite hero, citing his defining characteristics as his mustache, red cap, plumbing prowess, and his mushrooms. In a poll conducted in 2008 by Oricon, Mario was voted as the most popular video game character in Japan by both men and women, overtaking popular video game icons such as &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; &quot;Cloud Strife&quot; and &quot;Metal Gear&quot; &quot;Solid Snake&quot;. Yahoo! Japan held a poll between November 1, 2009, and October 31, 2010, to determine which video game character is more popular among readers. Mario won the poll with 9,862 votes. Several publications have often compared Mario to &quot;Sega&quot; mascot and iconic character, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;. Mario also serves as an inspiration for &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; origin.

===Legacy===
Mario has been established as a pop culture icon and has appeared on lunch boxes, T-shirts, magazines, and commercials (notably in a Got Milk? commercial). Other products include cartoon shows, movies, books, hats, plush dolls, cereals, ice cream, bedding, kitchenware, clocks, purses, cufflinks, wallets, mugs, art prints, boxers, Lego sets, coaster sets, Hot Wheels sets, stationery sets, and board games.

Mario has inspired unlicensed paintings, performances on talent shows such as &quot;India&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;, short films, and web series. The character has been present in a number of works created by third parties other than Nintendo, such as in the iOS and Android video game &quot;Platform Panic&quot;, in which one of the purchasable skins is a reference to him. &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed II&quot;, an action-adventure video game created by Ubisoft, features a reference to the &quot;Super Mario&quot; series. The game&#x27;s protagonist, &quot;Ezio Auditore da Firenze&quot;, gets attacked on the road; his uncle saves him and introduces himself by saying Mario&#x27;s iconic catchphrase, &quot;It&#x27;s a-me, Mario!&quot; &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game created by Blizzard Entertainment, features two non-playable characters named Muigin and Larion, who are references to Mario and Luigi. It also features a jumpbot that resembles Mario&#x27;s appearance.

Many people and places have been named or nicknamed after Mario. Bergsala, the distributor of Nintendo&#x27;s products in the Nordic and the Baltic countries, is located at Marios Gata 21 (Mario&#x27;s Street 21) in Kungsbacka, Sweden, named after Mario. Many sports stars, including Bundesliga football players Mario Götze and Mario Gómez, National Hockey League player Mario Lemieux, Italian footballer Mario Balotelli, Italian cyclist Mario Cipollini, and American former footballer Mario Williams have been given the nickname &quot;Super Mario&quot;. In a suburb of the Spanish city of Zaragoza, streets were named after video games, including &quot;Avenida de Super Mario Bros.&quot;

Mario&#x27;s legacy is recognized by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, who awarded the Nintendo mascot, and the series of platform games he has appeared in, seven world records in the &quot;Guinness World Records: Gamer&#x27;s Edition 2008.&quot; These records include &quot;Best Selling Video Game Series of All Time&quot;, &quot;First Movie Based on an Existing Video Game&quot;, and &quot;Most Prolific Video Game Character&quot;, with Mario appearing in 116 original games. In 2009, &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; listed him as the second most recognizable video game character in the United States, recognized by 93 percent of the population, second only to Pac-Man, who was recognized by 94 percent of the population. In 2011, readers of &quot;Guinness World Records Gamer&#x27;s Edition&quot; voted Mario as the top video game character of all time. In 2018, Charles Martinet, voice actor of Mario, received the &quot;Guinness World Record&quot; for most video game voice-over performances as the same character.

Mario appeared in the 2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony to promote the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. In a pre-recorded video, the prime minister Shinzo Abe became Mario to use a Warp pipe planted by Doraemon from Shibuya Crossing to Maracanã Stadium. Abe then appeared dressed as Mario in an oversized Warp Pipe in the middle of the stadium. This segment was favorably well received as playful and tasteful in Japan, resulting in giving Abe the nickname &quot;Abe-Mario&quot;.

Mario Day is celebrated on March 10, as when that date is presented as &quot;Mar 10&quot; it resembles the word &quot;Mario&quot;. Since 2016 the day has been officially observed by Nintendo, who celebrates the day annually by promoting &quot;Mario&quot; games and holding &quot;Mario&quot;-related events. In March 2018, Google Maps collaborated with Nintendo for the celebration of Mario Day. By tapping on a yellow ? Block, the navigation arrow changes into Mario, who drives his Pipe Frame kart from the &quot;Mario Kart&quot; series. In March 2024, American actor Gaten Matarazzo teamed up with Nintendo to celebrate that year&#x27;s Mario Day.

<text>Charles-François Daubigny ( , , ; 15 February 181719 February 1878) was a French painter, one of the members of the Barbizon school, and is considered an important precursor of impressionism.

He was also a prolific printmaker, mostly in etching, and one of the main artists who used the cliché verre technique.

==Biography==
Daubigny was born in Paris, into a family of painters; taught art by his father, , and his uncle, miniaturist Pierre Daubigny (1793-1858). He was also a pupil of Jean-Victor Bertin, Jacques Raymond Brascassat and Paul Delaroche, from whom he would quickly emancipate himself. Though best known for his painted landscapes, Daubigny survived for many years as a graphic artist, illustrating books, magazines and travel guides for publication.

In 1838, he set up, at the Rue des Amandiers-Popincourt, a community of artists, a phalanstery, with Adolphe-Victor Geoffroy-Dechaume, Hippolyte Lavoignat, Ernest Meissonnier, Auguste Steinheil, Louis Joseph Trimolet, with whom he already had expressed his interest in subjects drawn directly from daily life and nature. These artists will work, among others, for the publisher Léon Curmer, who was specialized in books illustrated with vignettes. From this period date the first confirmed engravings by Daubigny. 

Initially Daubigny painted in a more traditional style, but this changed after 1843 when he settled in Barbizon to work outside in nature. Even more important was his meeting with Camille Corot in 1852 in Optevoz (Isère). On his famous boat &quot;Botin&quot;, which he had turned into a studio, he painted along the Seine and Oise, often in the region around Auvers. From 1852 onward, he was influenced by Gustave Courbet. The two artists were from the same generation and were driven by the realist movement: during a joint stay, each composed a series of views of Optevoz.

In 1848, Daubigny worked on behalf of the Chalcographie du Louvre, performing facsimiles, which testifies to his great expertise in this art, and revisiting the technique of aquatint in a less cumbersome process. His famous series of &quot;Rolling Carts&quot; dates from this period. In 1862, with Corot, he experimented with the cliché-verre technique, halfway between photography and printmaking.

In 1866, he joined the jury of the Paris Salon for the first time, alongside his friend Corot. The same year, Daubigny visited England, eventually returning because of the Franco-Prussian war, in 1870. In London he met Claude Monet, and they left for the Netherlands together. Back in Auvers, he met Paul Cézanne, another important Impressionist. It is assumed that these younger impressionist painters were influenced by Daubigny.

Daubigny died in Paris in 1878. His remains are interred at cimetière du Père-Lachaise (division 24). 

His followers and pupils included his son (whose works are occasionally mistaken for those of his father), , Hippolyte Camille Delpy, Albert Charpin and Pierre Emmanuel Damoye. The two painters who introduced the Barbizon School in Portugal, in 1879, António da Silva Porto and João Marques de Oliveira, were also his disciples.

==Paintings==

The most striking paintings by Daubigny were those produced between 1864 and 1874, which depict mostly forest landscapes and lakes. Disappointed because he felt that he did not meet with the same level of success and admiration as his contemporaries, by the end of his career he was nonetheless an extremely sought-after and appreciated artist. The motifs of his paintings, sometimes tending towards repetitiveness and often playing on the horizontality of the landscape underlined by a backlight effect, would be taken up and accentuated by Hippolyte Camille Delpy, his most influenced student.

His most ambitious canvases include &quot;Springtime&quot; (1857), in the Louvre; &quot;Borde de la Cure&quot;, Morvan (1864); &quot;Villerville sur Mer&quot; (1864); &quot;Moonlight&quot; (1865); &quot;Auvers-sur-Oise&quot; (1868); and &quot;Return of the Flock&quot; (1878). He was named by the French government as an Officer of the Legion of Honor.

==In popular culture==
The life of Daubigny was adapted into a graphic novel by Belgian comics writer Bruno de Roover and artist Luc Cromheecke. It appeared under the title &quot;De Tuin van Daubigny&quot; (&quot;The Garden of Daubigny&quot;, 2016).

<doc id="81425" wikidata="Q313013" url="?curid=81425" title="Brian Wilson">
<text>Brian Douglas Wilson (born June 20, 1942) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer who co-founded the Beach Boys. Often called a genius for his novel approaches to pop composition, extraordinary musical aptitude, and mastery of recording techniques, he is widely acknowledged as one of the most innovative and significant songwriters of the 20th century. His best-known work is distinguished for its high production values, complex harmonies and orchestrations, layered vocals, and introspective or ingenuous themes. Wilson is also known for his formerly high-ranged singing and lifelong struggles with mental illness.

Raised in Hawthorne, California, Wilson&#x27;s formative influences included George Gershwin, the Four Freshmen, Phil Spector, and Burt Bacharach. In 1961, he began his professional career as a member of the Beach Boys, serving as the band&#x27;s songwriter, producer, co-lead vocalist, bassist, keyboardist, and &quot;de facto&quot; leader. After signing with Capitol Records in 1962, he became the first pop artist credited for writing, arranging, producing, and performing his own material. He also produced other acts, most notably the Honeys and American Spring. By the mid-1960s he had written or co-written more than two dozen U.S. Top 40 hits, including the number-ones &quot;Surf City&quot; (1963), &quot;I Get Around&quot; (1964), &quot;Help Me, Rhonda&quot; (1965), and &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; (1966). He is considered among the first music producer &quot;auteurs&quot; and the first rock producers to apply the studio as an instrument.

In 1964, Wilson had a nervous breakdown and resigned from regular concert touring to focus on songwriting and production, leading to works such as the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; and his first credited solo release, &quot;Caroline, No&quot; (both 1966), as well as the unfinished album &quot;Smile&quot;. As he declined professionally and psychologically in the late 1960s, his contributions to the band diminished, and legends grew around his lifestyle of seclusion, overeating, and drug abuse. His first comeback, divisive among fans, yielded the would-be solo effort &quot;The Beach Boys Love You&quot; (1977). In the 1980s, he formed a controversial creative and business partnership with his psychologist, Eugene Landy, and relaunched his solo career with the self-titled album &quot;Brian Wilson&quot; (1988). Wilson disassociated from Landy in 1991 and went on to tour regularly as a solo artist from 1999 to 2022.

Heralding popular music&#x27;s recognition as an art form, Wilson&#x27;s accomplishments as a producer helped initiate an era of unprecedented creative autonomy for label-signed acts. The youth culture of the 1960s is commonly associated with his early songs, and he is regarded as an important figure to many music genres and movements, including the California sound, art pop, psychedelia, chamber pop, progressive music, punk, outsider, and sunshine pop. Since the 1980s, his influence has extended to styles such as post-punk, indie rock, emo, dream pop, &quot;Shibuya-kei&quot;, and chillwave. Wilson&#x27;s accolades include numerous industry awards, inductions into multiple music halls of fame, and entries on several &quot;greatest of all time&quot; critics&#x27; rankings.

==1942–1961: Background and musical training==
===Childhood===
Brian Douglas Wilson was born on June 20, 1942, at Centinela Hospital Medical Center in Inglewood, California, the first child of Audree Neva ( Korthof) and Murry Wilson, a machinist who later pursued songwriting part-time. His ancestry includes Dutch, Scottish, English, German, Irish, and Swedish origins. Wilson&#x27;s two younger brothers, Dennis and Carl, were born in 1944 and 1946. Shortly after Dennis&#x27; birth, the family moved from Inglewood to 3701 West 119th Street in nearby Hawthorne, California. Wilson, along with his siblings, suffered psychological and sporadic physical maltreatment from their father. His 2016 memoir characterizes his father as &quot;violent&quot; and &quot;cruel&quot;; however, it also suggests that certain narratives about the mistreatment had been overstated or unfounded.

From an early age, Wilson exhibited an unusually high aptitude for learning by ear. His father remembered how, after hearing only a few verses of &quot;When the Caissons Go Rolling Along&quot;, the infant Wilson was able to reproduce its melody. Murry was a driving force in cultivating his children&#x27;s musical talents. Wilson undertook six weeks of accordion lessons, and by ages seven and eight, he performed choir solos at church. His choir director declared him to have perfect pitch. When Wilson was 12 years old, his family acquired an upright piano, and he then shifted his focus from accordion. He began teaching himself to play piano by spending hours mastering his favorite songs. He learned how to write manuscript music through a friend of his father.

Wilson sang with peers at school functions, as well as with family and friends at home, and guided his two brothers in learning harmony parts, which they would rehearse together. He also played piano obsessively after school, deconstructing the harmonies of the Four Freshmen by listening to short segments of their songs on a phonograph, then working to recreate the blended sounds note by note on the keyboard. Moreover, Wilson owned an educational record titled &quot;The Instruments of the Orchestra&quot; and was a regular listener of KFWB, his favorite radio station at the time. Carl introduced him to R&amp;B, and their uncle Charlie taught him boogie-woogie piano. Both brothers would frequently stay up listening to Johnny Otis&#x27; KFOX radio show, deliberating over its R&amp;B tracks and incorporating them into their musical lexicon. Carl remarked that by the age of 10, Wilson &quot;could play great boogie-woogie piano!&quot;

Carl remembered the numerous years when Wilson&#x27;s life revolved solely around listening to Four Freshmen records and playing the piano for extensive periods. Dennis portrayed his elder brother as a &quot;freak&quot; who preferred listening to records over activities like baseball. One of Wilson&#x27;s first forays into songwriting, penned on paper when he was nine, was a reinterpretation of the lyrics to Stephen Foster&#x27;s &quot;Oh! Susannah&quot;. In his 1991 memoir, he recalls writing his first song for a 4th grade school project concerning Paul Bunyan. In a 2005 interview, he said that he began composing original music in 1955, when he was 12.

===High school and college===
In high school, Wilson played quarterback for Hawthorne High&#x27;s football team, played baseball for American Legion Ball, and ran cross-country in his senior year. At 15, he briefly worked part-time sweeping at a jewelry store, his only paid employment before his success in music. He also cleaned for his father&#x27;s machining company, ABLE, on weekends. Wilson auditioned to sing for the Original Sound Record Company&#x27;s inaugural record release, &quot;Chapel of Love&quot; (unrelated to the 1964 song), but was deemed too young. For his 16th birthday, he received a portable two-track Wollensak tape recorder, allowing him to experiment with recording songs, group vocals, and rudimentary production techniques. Wilson involved his friends around the piano and would most frequently harmonize with those from his senior class in these recordings.

Written for his Senior Problems course in October 1959, Wilson submitted an essay, &quot;My Philosophy&quot;, in which he stated that his ambitions were to &quot;make a name for myself [...] in music.&quot; One of Wilson&#x27;s earliest public performances was at a fall arts program at his high school. He enlisted his cousin and frequent singing partner Mike Love and, to entice Carl into the group, named the newly formed membership &quot;Carl and the Passions&quot;. They performed songs by Dion and the Belmonts and the Four Freshmen, impressing classmate and musician, Al Jardine.

Fred Morgan, Wilson&#x27;s high school music teacher, noted his aptitude for learning Bach and Beethoven at 17. Nonetheless, he gave Wilson a final grade of C for his Piano and Harmony course due to incomplete assignments. Instead of a 120-measure piano sonata for his final project, Wilson submitted a shorter 32-measure piece, earning an F. Reflecting on his last year of high school, Wilson said that he was &quot;&quot;very&quot; happy. I wouldn&#x27;t say I was popular in school, but I was associated with popular people.&quot;

In September 1960, Wilson enrolled as a psychology major at El Camino College in Los Angeles, also pursuing music. Disappointed by his teachers&#x27; disdain for pop music, he withdrew from college after about 18 months. By his account, he crafted his first entirely original melody, &quot;Surfer Girl&quot;, in 1961, inspired by a Dion and the Belmonts rendition of &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot;. However, his close high school friends disputed his claim, recalling earlier original compositions from him.

===Formation of the Beach Boys===

The three Wilson brothers, Love, and Jardine debuted their first music group together, called &quot;the Pendletones&quot;, in the autumn of 1961. At Dennis&#x27;s suggestion, Brian and Love co-wrote the group&#x27;s first song, &quot;Surfin&#x27;&quot;. After practicing in the Wilsons&#x27; music room, the group secured Murry Wilson as their manager and prepared for their initial studio session.

Produced by Hite and Dorinda Morgan on Candix Records, &quot;Surfin&#x27;&quot; became a hit in Los Angeles and reached 75 on the national &quot;Billboard&quot; sales charts. However, the group&#x27;s name was changed by Candix Records to the Beach Boys. Their major live debut was at the Ritchie Valens Memorial Dance on New Year&#x27;s Eve, 1961. Just days before, Wilson had received an electric bass from his father, quickly learning to play with Jardine switching to rhythm guitar.

When Candix Records faced financial difficulties and sold the Beach Boys&#x27; master recordings to another label, Murry ended their contract. As &quot;Surfin&#x27;&quot; faded from the charts, Wilson collaborated with local musician Gary Usher to produce demo recordings for new tracks, including &quot;409&quot; and &quot;Surfin&#x27; Safari&quot;. Capitol Records were persuaded to release the demos as a single, achieving a double-sided national hit.

==1962–1966: Peak years==

===Early productions and freelancing===
As a member of the Beach Boys, Wilson was signed by Capitol Records&#x27; Nick Venet to a seven-year contract in 1962. Recording sessions for the band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Surfin&#x27; Safari&quot;, took place in Capitol&#x27;s basement studios in the famous tower building in August, but early on Wilson lobbied for a different place to cut Beach Boys tracks. The large rooms were built to record the big orchestras and ensembles of the 1950s, not small rock groups. At Wilson&#x27;s insistence, Capitol agreed to let the Beach Boys pay for their own outside recording sessions, to which Capitol would own all the rights. Additionally, during the taping of their first LP, Wilson fought for, and won, the right to helm the production — though this fact was not acknowledged with a production credit in the album liner notes.

Wilson remarked, &quot;I&#x27;ve always felt I was a behind-the-scenes man, rather than an entertainer.&quot; He had been a massive fan of Phil Spector — who had risen to fame with the Teddy Bears — and aspired to model his burgeoning career after the record producer. With Gary Usher, Wilson wrote numerous songs patterned after the Teddy Bears, and they wrote and produced some records for local talent, albeit with no commercial success. Wilson gradually dissolved his partnership with Usher due to interference from Murry. Wilson&#x27;s first record that he produced outside of the Beach Boys, albeit uncredited, was Rachel and the Revolvers&#x27; &quot;The Revo-Lution&quot;, written with Usher and issued by Dot Records in September.

By mid-1962, Wilson was writing songs with DJ Roger Christian, whom he had met through either Murry or Usher, and guitarist Bob Norberg, who became Wilson&#x27;s roommate. David Marks said, &quot;He was obsessed with it. Brian was writing song with people off the street in front of his house, disc jockeys, anyone. He had so much stuff flowing through him at once he could hardly handle it.&quot; In October, Safari Records, a label created by Murry, released the single &quot;The Surfer Moon&quot; by Bob &amp; Sheri. It was the first record that bore the label &quot;Produced by Brian Wilson&quot;. The only other record the label issued was Bob &amp; Sheri&#x27;s &quot;Humpty Dumpty&quot;. Both songs were written by Wilson.

From January to March 1963, Wilson produced the Beach Boys&#x27; second album, &quot;Surfin&#x27; U.S.A.&quot;. To focus his efforts on writing and recording, he limited his public appearances with the group to television gigs and local shows. Otherwise, David Marks acted as Wilson&#x27;s substitute on vocals. In March, Capitol released the Beach Boys&#x27; first top-ten single, &quot;Surfin&#x27; U.S.A.&quot;, which began their long run of highly successful recording efforts at Western. The &quot;Surfin&#x27; U.S.A.&quot; album was also a big hit in the U.S., reaching number two on the national sales charts by July. The Beach Boys had become a top-rank recording and touring band.

Against Venet&#x27;s wishes, Wilson worked with non-Capitol acts. Shortly after meeting Liberty Records&#x27; Jan and Dean (likely in August 1962), Wilson offered them a new song he had written, &quot;Surf City&quot;, which the duo soon recorded. On July 20, 1963, &quot;Surf City&quot;, which Wilson co-wrote with Jan Berry, was his first composition to reach the top of the US charts. The resulting success pleased Wilson, but angered both Murry and Capitol Records. Murry went so far as to order his oldest son to sever any future collaborations with Jan and Dean, although they continued to appear on each other&#x27;s records. Wilson&#x27;s hits with Jan and Dean effectively revitalized the music duo&#x27;s then-faltering career.

Around the same time, Wilson began producing a girl group, the Honeys, consisting of sisters Marilyn and Diane Rovell and their cousin Ginger Blake, who were local high school students he had met at a Beach Boys concert during the previous August. Wilson pitched the Honeys to Capitol, envisioning them as a female counterpart to the Beach Boys. The company released several Honeys recordings as singles, although they sold poorly. In the meantime, Wilson became closely acquainted with the Rovell family and made their home his primary residence for most of 1963 and 1964.

Wilson was for the first time officially credited as the Beach Boys&#x27; producer on the album &quot;Surfer Girl&quot;, recorded in June and July 1963 and released that September. This LP reached number seven on the national charts, with similarly successful singles. He also produced a set of largely car-oriented tunes for the Beach Boys&#x27; fourth album, &quot;Little Deuce Coupe&quot;, which was released in October 1963, only three weeks after the &quot;Surfer Girl&quot; LP. Still resistant to touring, Wilson was replaced onstage for many of the band&#x27;s live performances in mid-1963 by Al Jardine, who had briefly quit the band to focus on school. Wilson was forced to rejoin the touring line-up upon Marks&#x27; departure in late 1963.

Towards the end of 1963, Wilson formed a record production company, Brian Wilson Productions, with an office on Sunset Boulevard, and a music publishing company, Ocean Music, for songs he wrote for other artists. Excepting his work with the Beach Boys, for the whole of 1963, Wilson had written, arranged, produced, or performed on at least 42 songs with the Honeys, Jan and Dean, the Survivors, Sharon Marie, the Timers, the Castells (&quot;I Do&quot;), Bob Norberg, Vickie Kocher, Gary Usher, Christian, Paul Petersen (&quot;She Rides with Me&quot;), and Larry Denton (&quot;Endless Sleep&quot;).

===International success and first nervous breakdown===

Throughout 1964, Wilson engaged in worldwide concert tours with the Beach Boys while continuing to write and produce for the group, whose studio output for this year included the albums &quot;Shut Down Volume 2&quot; (March), &quot;All Summer Long&quot; (June), and &quot;The Beach Boys&#x27; Christmas Album&quot; (November). Following a particularly stressful Australasian tour in early 1964, it was agreed by the group to dismiss Murry from his managerial duties. Murry still had a subsequent influence over the band&#x27;s activities and kept a direct correspondence with Wilson, giving him thoughts about the group&#x27;s decisions; Wilson also periodically sought music opinions from his father.

In February, Beatlemania swept the U.S., a development that deeply disturbed Wilson. In a 1966 interview, he commented, &quot;The Beatles invasion shook me up a lot. They eclipsed a lot of what we&#x27;d worked for. [...] The Beach Boys&#x27; supremacy as the number one vocal group in America was being challenged. So we stepped on the gas a little bit.&quot; Author James Perone identifies the Beach Boys&#x27; May single &quot;I Get Around&quot;, their first U.S. number one hit, as representing both a successful response by Wilson to the British Invasion, and the beginning of an unofficial rivalry between him and the Beatles, principally Paul McCartney. The B-side, &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry Baby&quot;, was cited by Wilson in a 1970 interview as &quot;Probably the best record we&#x27;ve done&quot;.

The increasing pressures of Wilson&#x27;s career and personal life pushed him to a psychological breaking point. He had ceased writing surfing-themed material after &quot;Don&#x27;t Back Down&quot; in April, and during the group&#x27;s first major European tour, in late 1964, replied angrily to a journalist when asked how he felt about originating the surfing sound. Wilson resented being identified with surf and car songs, explaining that he had only intended to &quot;produce a sound that teens dig, and that can be applied to any theme. [...] We&#x27;re just gonna stay on the life of a social teenager.&quot; He later described himself as a &quot;Mr Everything&quot; that had been so &quot;run down mentally and emotionally [...] to the point where I had no peace of mind and no chance to actually sit down and think or even rest.&quot; Adding to his concerns was the group&#x27;s &quot;business operations&quot; and the quality of their records, which he believed suffered from this arrangement. On December 7, in an effort to bring himself more emotional stability, Wilson impulsively married Marilyn Rovell.

On December 23, Wilson was to accompany his bandmates on a two-week US tour, but while on a flight from Los Angeles to Houston, began sobbing uncontrollably over his marriage. Al Jardine, who had sat next to Wilson on the plane, later said, &quot;None of us had ever witnessed something like that.&quot; Wilson played the show in Houston later that day, but was replaced by session musician Glen Campbell for the rest of the tour dates. At the time, Wilson described it as &quot;the first of a series of three breakdowns I had.&quot; When the group resumed recording their next album in January 1965, Wilson declared to his bandmates that he would be withdrawing from future tours. He later told a journalist that his decision had been a byproduct of his &quot;fucked up&quot; jealousy toward Spector and the Beatles.

In 1965, Wilson immediately showcased great advances in his musical development with the albums &quot;The Beach Boys Today!&quot; (March) and &quot;Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!)&quot; (June). Campbell remained on tour with the band until he was no longer able to, in February. As a thanks, Wilson produced a single for Campbell in March, &quot;Guess I&#x27;m Dumb&quot;, after which the band recruited Columbia Records staff producer Bruce Johnston as Wilson&#x27;s substitute on tour. In February, March, July, and October, Wilson rejoined the live group for one-off occasions.

===Growing drug use and religious epiphany===

With his bandmates often away on tour, Wilson distanced himself socially from the other Beach Boys. Since the autumn of 1964, he had moved from the Rovells&#x27; home to a one-bedroom apartment at 7235 Hollywood Boulevard, and given his newfound independence, had begun forming a new social circle for himself through the industry connections he had accumulated. Biographer Steven Gaines writes, &quot;Brian had total freedom from family restraints for the first time. [...] he was finally able to make a new set of friends without parental interference.&quot; By Gary Usher&#x27;s account, Wilson had had few close friends and was &quot;like a piece of clay waiting to be molded&quot;. By the end of the year, Wilson was one of the most successful, influential, and sought-after young musicians in Los Angeles. However, a wider public recognition of Wilson&#x27;s talents eluded him until 1966.

Wilson&#x27;s closest friend in this period was Loren Schwartz, a talent agent that he had met at a Hollywood studio. Through Schwartz, Wilson was exposed to a wealth of literature and mystical topics—largely of philosophy and world religions—that he formed a deep fascination with. Schwartz also introduced marijuana and hashish to Wilson, whose habitual use of the drug caused a rift in his marriage to Marilyn, further strained by his frequent visitations to Schwartz&#x27;s apartment. Beginning with &quot;Please Let Me Wonder&quot; (1965), Wilson wrote songs while under the influence of marijuana.

Early in 1965, a few weeks after Wilson and his wife moved into a new apartment on West Hollywood&#x27;s Gardner Street, Wilson took the psychedelic drug LSD (or &quot;acid&quot;) for the first time, under Schwartz&#x27; supervision. In Wilson&#x27;s words, &quot;I took LSD and it just tore my head off. [...] You just come to grips with what you are, what you can do [and] can&#x27;t do, and learn to face it.&quot; During his first acid trip, he went to a piano and devised the riff for the band&#x27;s next single, &quot;California Girls&quot;. He later described the instrumental tracking for the song, held on April 6, as &quot;my favorite session&quot;, and the opening orchestral section as &quot;the greatest piece of music that I&#x27;ve ever written.&quot; For the remainder of the year, he experienced considerable paranoia, which he attributed to his LSD consumption.
Following unsuccessful attempts to distance her husband from Schwartz, Marilyn separated from Wilson for at least a month. She later said, &quot;He was not the same Brian that he was before the drugs. [...] These people were very hurtful, and I tried to get that through to Brian.&quot; The couple soon reconciled, and, in late 1965, moved into a newly purchased home at 1448 Laurel Way in Beverly Hills. The house was constantly occupied by visitors, a situation that he, in his words, &quot;didn&#x27;t mind&quot; so long as he had space to &quot;cop out and sit, thinking&quot;.

===&quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, &quot;genius&quot; campaign, and &quot;Smile&quot;===
Wilson recalled that after relocating to his Laurel Way home, he experienced an unexpected surge of creativity at his &quot;big Spanish table&quot;, where he sat for hours developing ideas for new music. He said, &quot;I was taking a lot of drugs, fooling around with pills, a lot of pills, and it fouled me up for a while. It got me really introspective&quot;. Over a period of five months, he planned an album that would reflect his growing interest in &quot;the making of music for people on a spiritual level&quot;.

In December 1965, Tony Asher, a jingle writer whom Wilson had recently met, accepted Wilson&#x27;s offer to be his writing partner for what became the Beach Boys&#x27; next album, &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; (May 1966). He produced most of &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; from January to April 1966 at four Hollywood studios, mainly employing his bandmates on vocals and his usual pool of session musicians for the backing tracks. Among the album tracks, he later described &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Away for Awhile&quot; as &quot;the most satisfying piece of music&quot; he had made to date and &quot;I Just Wasn&#x27;t Made for These Times&quot; as an autobiographical song &quot;about a guy who was crying because he thought he was too advanced&quot;. In 1995, he referred to &quot;Caroline, No&quot; as &quot;probably the best I&#x27;ve ever written&quot;.

Released in March 1966, the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Caroline, No&quot;, marked the first record credited to Wilson as a solo artist. It led to speculation that he was considering leaving the band. Wilson recalled, &quot;I explained to [the rest of the group], &#x27;It&#x27;s OK. It is only a temporary rift where I have something to say.&#x27; I wanted to step out of the group a little bit and, sure enough, I was able to.&quot; &quot;Caroline, No&quot; ultimately stalled at number 32. In the U.S., &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; faced similarly underwhelming sales. Wilson was &quot;mortified&quot; that his artistic growth failed to translate into a number-one album. According to Marilyn, &quot;When it wasn&#x27;t received by the public the way he thought it would be received, it made him hold back. ... but he didn&#x27;t stop. He couldn&#x27;t stop. He needed to create more.&quot;

Thanks to mutual connections, Wilson had been introduced to the Beatles&#x27; former press officer Derek Taylor, who was subsequently employed as the Beach Boys&#x27; publicist. Responding to Wilson&#x27;s request to inspire a greater public appreciation for his talents, Taylor initiated a media campaign that proclaimed Wilson to be a genius. Taylor&#x27;s prestige was crucial in offering a credible perspective to those on the outside, and his efforts are widely recognized as instrumental in the album&#x27;s success in Britain. In turn, however, Wilson resented that the branding had the effect of creating higher public expectations for himself. The fact that the music press had begun undervaluing the contributions of the rest of the group also frustrated him and his bandmates, including Love and Carl Wilson.

For the remainder of 1966, Wilson focused on completing the band&#x27;s single &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, which became a number-one hit in December, and a new batch of songs written with session musician Van Dyke Parks for inclusion on &quot;Smile&quot;, the planned follow-up to &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. Wilson touted the album as a &quot;teenage symphony to God&quot; and continued to involve more people in his social, business, and creative affairs. Parks said that, eventually, &quot;it wasn&#x27;t just Brian and me in a room; it was Brian and me ... and all kinds of self-interested people pulling him in various directions.&quot; Television producer David Oppenheim, who attended these scenes to film the documentary &quot;Inside Pop: The Rock Revolution&quot; (1967), characterized Wilson&#x27;s home as a &quot;playpen of irresponsible people.&quot;

==1966–1973: Decline==

===Home studio transition===

&quot;Smile&quot; was never finished, due in large part to Wilson&#x27;s worsening mental condition and exhaustion. His friends, family, and colleagues often date the project&#x27;s unraveling and Wilson&#x27;s onset of erratic behavior to around November 1966—namely, when he recorded the would-be album track &quot;Mrs. O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s Cow&quot; (or &quot;Fire&quot;). In April 1967, Wilson and his wife put their Laurel Way home up for sale and took residence at a newly purchased mansion on 10452 Bellagio Road in Bel Air. Wilson also set to work on constructing a personal home studio. By then, most of his new contacts had disassociated or were exiled from his social circle.

In May, Derek Taylor announced that the six-months-overdue &quot;Smile&quot; album had been &quot;scrapped&quot;. Wilson explained in a 1968 interview, &quot;We pulled out of that production pace, really because I was about ready to die. I was trying so hard. So, all of a sudden I decided not to try any more.&quot; The underwhelming critical and commercial response to the band&#x27;s July single &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; has been cited as another exacerbating factor in his professional and psychological decline. He later acknowledged that upholding his industry reputation &quot;was a really big thing for me&quot; and that he had grown tired of being expected to compose &quot;great orchestral stuff all the time&quot;.

Starting with &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; (September 1967), the band made Wilson&#x27;s home their primary base of recording operations until 1972. The album was also the first in which production was credited to the entire group instead of Wilson alone. Producer Terry Melcher attributed this change to Wilson&#x27;s self-consciousness over his reputation, unwilling to &quot;put his stamp on records so that peers will have a Brian Wilson track to criticize.&quot; In August, Wilson rejoined the live band for two one-off appearances in Honolulu. The shows were recorded for a planned live album, &quot;Lei&#x27;d in Hawaii&quot;, that was never finished.

During the sessions for &quot;Wild Honey&quot; (December), Wilson requested Carl to contribute more to the record-making process. Wilson also attempted to produce an album for singer Danny Hutton&#x27;s new group, Redwood, but after the recording of three songs, including &quot;Time to Get Alone&quot; and &quot;Darlin&#x27;&quot;, this motion was halted by Mike Love and Carl Wilson, who wanted Brian to focus on the Beach Boys&#x27; contractual obligations. &quot;Friends&quot; (June 1968) was recorded during a period of emotional recovery for Wilson. Although it included more contributions from the rest of the group, he actively led the studio sessions, even on the songs that he did not write. He later referred to it as his second &quot;solo album&quot; (the first being &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;), as well as his favorite Beach Boys album.

===Institutionalization and &quot;Bedroom Tapes&quot;===
For the remainder of 1968, Wilson&#x27;s songwriting output declined substantially, as did his emotional state, leading him to self-medicate with the excessive consumption of food, alcohol, and drugs. Amid the looming financial insolvency of the Beach Boys, he began to supplement his regular use of amphetamines and marijuana with cocaine. Hutton, who had introduced Wilson to cocaine, recalled that Wilson expressed suicidal wishes at the time, and that it was when his &quot;real decline started&quot;.

In mid-1968, Wilson was admitted to a psychiatric hospital, possibly of his own volition. His issues were not disclosed to the public, and sessions for &quot;20/20&quot; (February 1969) continued in his absence. Journalist Nik Cohn, writing in 1968, said that Wilson had been rumored to be &quot;increasingly withdrawn, brooding, hermitic [...] and occasionally, he is to be seen in the back of some limousine, cruising around Hollywood, bleary and unshaven, huddled way tight into himself.&quot; Once discharged later in the year, Wilson rarely finished any tracks for the band, leaving much of his subsequent output for Carl Wilson to complete.

Regarding Wilson&#x27;s participation in the group&#x27;s recordings from that time, band engineer Stephen Desper said that Wilson remained &quot;indirectly involved with production&quot; through Carl. The bathrobe-clad Wilson would occasionally appear from his bedroom to preview a new song for the group, an event that Melcher likened to Aesop delivering a new fable. Otherwise, he stayed in his bedroom upstairs while his bandmates recorded in the studio down below. He would occasionally visit a session if he had heard a piece of music that he felt should be changed.

Conversely, Dennis Wilson recalled that his elder brother began to have &quot;no involvement at all&quot; with the Beach Boys, which forced the group to &quot;find things that [he] worked on and try and piece it together.&quot; Marilyn Wilson recalled that her husband withdrew because of perceived resentment from the group: &quot;It was like, &#x27;OK, you assholes, you think you can do as good as me or whatever—go ahead—&quot;you&quot; do it. You think it&#x27;s so easy? You do it.&#x27;&quot; Referencing the accusation that the Beach Boys refused to let Wilson work, Dennis said, &quot;I would go to his house daily and beg, &#x27;What can I do to help you?&#x27; I said, &#x27;Forget recording, forget all of it.&#x27; It got to Brian&#x27;s health.&quot;

Journalist Brian Chidester coined &quot;Bedroom Tapes&quot; as a loose umbrella term for Wilson&#x27;s subsequent unreleased output until 1975, despite the fact that his home studio was dismantled in 1972. Much of the material that Wilson recorded from the epoch remains unreleased and unheard by the public. Chidester states that some of it has been described as &quot;schizophrenia on tape&quot; and &quot;intensely personal songs of gentle humanism and strange experimentation, which reflected on his then-fragile emotional state.&quot; Wilson&#x27;s daughter Wendy remembered, &quot;Where other people might take a run to release some stress, he would go to the piano and write a 5-minute song.&quot;

===Radiant Radish and &quot;Sunflower&quot;===
Early in 1969, the Beach Boys commenced recording their album &quot;Sunflower&quot; (August 1970). Wilson was an active participant in the year-long sessions, writing more than an album&#x27;s worth of material by himself or with collaborators, most of which was left off the record. He recorded a single for the band, &quot;Break Away&quot;, that was co-written with his father, after which he was rarely in the studio until August 1969. Due to his poor reputation in the music industry, the Beach Boys struggled to secure a record contract with another label. In May, he revealed to reporters that the group were on the verge of bankruptcy. His remarks had the effect of ruining negotiations with Deutsche Grammophon and nearly compromised the band&#x27;s imminent tour of the UK and Europe. In July, Wilson opened a short-lived health food store, the Radiant Radish, with his friend Arnie Geller and cousin Steve Korthof.

In August, Sea of Tunes, the band&#x27;s publishing company that held the rights to their song catalog, was sold to Irving Almo Music for $700,000 (equivalent to $ in ). Wilson signed the consent letter at his father&#x27;s behest. According to Marilyn, the sale devastated Wilson. &quot;It killed him. &quot;Killed&quot; him. I don&#x27;t think he talked for days. [...] Brian took it as a personal thing, Murry not believing in him anymore.&quot; Around this period, Wilson attempted to drive his vehicle off a cliff, and on another occasion, demanded that he be pushed into and buried in a grave that he had dug in his backyard. He channeled his despondence into the writing of his song &quot;&#x27;Til I Die&quot;, which he described as the summation of &quot;everything I had to say at the time.&quot;

Later in 1969, Wilson produced a collection of spoken-word recordings, &quot;A World of Peace Must Come&quot;, for poet Stephen Kalinich. In November, Wilson and his band signed to Reprise Records, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Part of the contract stipulated Wilson&#x27;s proactive involvement with the group in all albums. Van Dyke Parks, who brokered the deal, said that &quot;They [the band] were considered a problem at that time [...] Everyone at the label just wanted Brian Wilson to come over and write some songs.&quot; Before the contract was effectuated, Wilson attended a band meeting with Reprise executives with his face painted bright green. Asked why he did this, Wilson responded, &quot;Just seeing what would happen.&quot;

Wilson briefly substituted for Love on the road in March 1970, later calling the experience &quot;the best three days of my life, I guess.&quot; In April, he attempted to produce a country and western album for the band&#x27;s co-manager Fred Vail, &quot;Cows in the Pasture&quot;. In mid-1970, Wilson was reported to be working on a &quot;chorus of frogs&quot; piece for Kalinich and contemplated scoring an Andy Warhol film about a homosexual surfer.

===&quot;Spring&quot; and Holland stay===
Wilson was deeply affected by the poor commercial response to &quot;Sunflower&quot; and resumed having minimal contributions to the Beach Boys&#x27; records. Bruce Johnston characterized him as merely &quot;a visitor&quot; to the sessions for &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; (August 1971). In November 1970, Wilson joined the live band for one-and-a-half dates at the Whisky a Go Go. Following this, Wilson told &quot;Melody Maker&quot; that although he had been &quot;quite happy living at home&quot;, he felt that he was &quot;not as creative as I once was and I&#x27;m not participating as much as I should have done.&quot; He identified himself as &quot;a kind of drop-out&quot; who sleeps into the afternoon and &quot;potter[s] around doing nothing much.&quot;

Speaking to a reporter one year later, in September 1971, Wilson said that he had recently returned to &quot;arranging, doing that more than writing now.&quot; In December, while at a concert in Long Beach, manager Jack Rieley coaxed Wilson into performing with the Beach Boys, although his time on stage lasted only minutes. In February 1972, Wilson went to an America gig at the Whisky a Go Go; according to Dan Peek, he &quot;held court like a Mad King as Danny Hutton scurried about like his court jester&quot; during the band&#x27;s performance.

From late 1971 to early 1972, Wilson and musician David Sandler collaborated on &quot;Spring&quot;, the first album by Marilyn Wilson and Diane Rovell&#x27;s new group, American Spring. As with much of Wilson&#x27;s work in the era, his contributions &quot;ebbed and flowed.&quot; It was the most involved Wilson had been in an album&#x27;s production since &quot;Friends&quot; in 1968. Meanwhile, Blondie Chaplin stated that Wilson rarely left his bedroom during the recording of &quot;Carl and the Passions&quot; (April 1972), but &quot;when he came down his contribution was amazing.&quot; Wilson&#x27;s unavailability was such that his image had to be superimposed into the group portrait included in the record&#x27;s inner sleeve.

During the summer of 1972, Wilson joined his bandmates when they temporarily moved base to Holland, albeit after much cajoling. While living in a Dutch house called &quot;Flowers&quot; and listening repeatedly to Randy Newman&#x27;s newest album &quot;Sail Away&quot;, Wilson was inspired to write a fairy tale, &quot;Mount Vernon and Fairway&quot;, loosely based on his memories listening to the radio at Mike Love&#x27;s family home as a teenager. The group rejected his proposal to include the fairy tale on their next album, &quot;Holland&quot; (January 1973). Instead, it was packaged with &quot;Holland&quot; as a bonus EP. In 1973, Jan Berry (under the alias JAN) released the single &quot;Don&#x27;t You Just Know It&quot;, a duet featuring Wilson. That April, Wilson briefly joined his bandmates onstage during an encore for the group&#x27;s concert at the Hollywood Palladium.

==1973–1975: Recluse period==
After his father&#x27;s death in June 1973, Wilson secluded himself in the chauffeur&#x27;s quarters of his home, where he spent his time sleeping, abusing drugs and alcohol, overeating, and exhibiting self-destructive behavior. He rarely ventured outside wearing anything but pajamas and later said that his father&#x27;s death &quot;had a lot to do with my retreating&quot;. Wilson&#x27;s family were eventually forced to take control of his financial affairs due to his irresponsible drug expenditures. This led Wilson to occasionally wander the city, begging for rides, drugs, and alcohol.

According to Wilson, from 1974 to 1975, his output was confined to only minimal, fragmentary recordings, attributing this limitation to a diminished capacity for sustained concentration. He elaborated that he had been preoccupied with snorting cocaine, reading magazines such as &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;Penthouse&quot;, and &quot;hanging out with Danny Hutton&quot;, whose Laurel Canyon house had become the center of Wilson&#x27;s social life. Although increasingly reclusive during the day, Wilson spent many nights at Hutton&#x27;s house fraternizing with colleagues such as Alice Cooper and Iggy Pop, who were mutually bemused by an extended Wilson-led singalong of the folk song &quot;Shortnin&#x27; Bread&quot;. Other visitors of Hutton&#x27;s home included Harry Nilsson, John Lennon, Ringo Starr and Keith Moon. On several occasions, Marilyn Wilson sent her friends to climb Hutton&#x27;s fence and retrieve her husband. In 1974, Wilson interrupted a set by jazz musician Larry Coryell at The Troubadour by leaping on stage and singing &quot;Be-Bop-A-Lula&quot; while wearing slippers and a bathrobe. 

Many reported anecdotes involving Wilson in the early 1970s, though frequently of questionable veracity, attained a legendary status. Recalling Wilson&#x27;s wellbeing at the time, John Sebastian said, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t all grimness.&quot; Jeff Foskett, then a Beach Boys fan who had visited Wilson&#x27;s home unannounced, similarly commented that Wilson had responded cordially to the visit and had belied the popular myths surrounding him. Wilson also participated in some recording sessions for Nilsson&#x27;s &quot;Salmon Falls&quot; and Keith Moon&#x27;s solo album, &quot;Two Sides of the Moon&quot;.

The Beach Boys&#x27; greatest hits compilation &quot;Endless Summer&quot; was a surprise success, becoming the band&#x27;s second number-one U.S. album in October 1974. To take advantage of their sudden resurgence in popularity, Wilson agreed to join his bandmates in Colorado for the recording of a new album at James William Guercio&#x27;s Caribou Ranch studio. The group completed a few tracks, including &quot;Child of Winter (Christmas Song)&quot;, but ultimately abandoned the project. Released as a single at the end of December 1974, &quot;Child of Winter&quot; was their first record that displayed the credit &quot;Produced by Brian Wilson&quot; since 1966.

Early in 1975, while still under contract with Warner Bros., Wilson signed a short-lived sideline production deal with Bruce Johnston and Terry Melcher&#x27;s Equinox Records. Together, they founded the loose-knit supergroup known as California Music, which also included involvement from Gary Usher, Curt Boettcher, and other Los Angeles musicians. Along with his guest appearances on Johnny Rivers&#x27; rendition of &quot;Help Me, Rhonda&quot; and Jackie DeShannon&#x27;s &quot;Boat to Sail&quot;, Wilson&#x27;s production of California Music&#x27;s single &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot; represents his only &quot;serious&quot; work throughout this period of semi-inactivity.

==1975–1982: &quot;Brian&#x27;s Back!&quot;==

===&quot;15 Big Ones&quot;, &quot;Love You&quot;, and &quot;Adult/Child&quot;===
Wilson&#x27;s overconsumption of food, cigarettes, alcohol, and other drugs—which now sometimes included heroin—further strained his marriage to Marilyn, who responded by threatening her husband with divorce or committing him to a mental institution. By then, Wilson&#x27;s weight had ballooned to . To help reverse his physical decline, in 1975, band manager Stephen Love appointed his brother Stan, a basketball player, as Wilson&#x27;s bodyguard, trainer, and caretaker. Marilyn also called in the band&#x27;s lawyers and accountants to remind her husband that, pursuant to the terms of his contract with Warner Bros., he was legally obliged to write and produce for the Beach Boys or else he would be sued by the label and lose his home. Stan was successful in improving Wilson&#x27;s health but after several months, went back to working with the NBA. Wilson then volunteered into psychologist Eugene Landy&#x27;s radical 24-hour therapy program in October.

Under Landy&#x27;s care, Wilson became more stable and socially engaged, with his productivity increasing once again. Throughout 1976, the tagline &quot;Brian&#x27;s Back!&quot; became a major promotional tool for the band&#x27;s concert tours, as well as their July release &quot;15 Big Ones&quot;, the first Beach Boys album that credited Wilson as the sole producer since &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. The sessions were fraught with tension, as Wilson&#x27;s bandmates fought against his wish to record a covers album and did not feel that he was ready to assume control of their studio proceedings. Ultimately, a compromise was reached, with the album including a mix of covers and originals.

Starting on July 2, 1976, Wilson made regular concert appearances with his bandmates for the first time since December 1964, singing and alternating between bass guitar and piano. In August, Wilson traveled with his group for concert dates outside of California, the first time he had done so since March 1970. NBC also premiered a Lorne Michaels-produced television special about the band, called simply &quot;The Beach Boys&quot;, which included recent concert footage, interviews, and a comedy sketch involving Wilson and &quot;NBC&#x27;s Saturday Night&quot; cast members Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi. Despite its success, the &quot;Brian&#x27;s Back&quot; promotion proved controversial. Wilson&#x27;s remarks to interviewers suggested that he had yet to fully recover from his addictions, and he remarked on one occasion that he &quot;&#x27;felt like a prisoner&quot;. A concert reviewer noted that Wilson &quot;seemed uncomfortable on stage&quot; and contributed &quot;nil&quot;.

From October 1976 to January 1977, Wilson produced a large collection of studio recordings, largely by himself while his bandmates were preoccupied with other personal and creative affairs. Released in April 1977, &quot;The Beach Boys Love You&quot; was the Beach Boys&#x27; first album to feature Wilson as a primary composer since &quot;Wild Honey&quot; in 1967. Originally titled &quot;Brian Loves You&quot;, Wilson played virtually all of the instruments on the album. Band engineer Earle Mankey described it as &quot;Brian Wilson giving what he had [to make] a serious, autobiographical album.&quot; Asked for his favorite Beach Boys albums in a 1998 interview, Wilson responded with &quot;15 Big Ones&quot; and &quot;Love You&quot;.

Wilson&#x27;s family and management relieved Landy of his services at the end of 1976, when he raised his monthly fees to $20,000 (equivalent to $ in ). Shortly afterward, Wilson told a journalist that he felt the treatment had been a success despite the exorbitant fees. Landy&#x27;s role as Wilson&#x27;s handler and constant supervisor was immediately taken over by Wilson&#x27;s cousins, Steve Korthof and Stan Love, and a professional model, Rocky Pamplin, who had been friends with Love in college. Wilson maintained a healthy, drug-free disposition for several months under their auspices.

In early 1977, Wilson produced &quot;Adult/Child&quot;, the intended follow-up to &quot;Love You&quot;, but it was kept unreleased due to artistic disputes. In March, the Beach Boys signed to CBS Records, whose contract stipulated that Wilson compose most of the material on all of the group&#x27;s albums. According to Gaines, &quot;When Brian signed the contract, he cried, knowing he would now have to go back to the studio full-time.&quot; Referencing the sessions for &quot;M.I.U. Album&quot; (October 1978), Wilson said that he went through a &quot;mental blank-out&quot; during this period. Wilson was credited as the album&#x27;s &quot;executive producer&quot;, likely for contractual reasons. Stan said that Wilson was &quot;depressed&quot; and &quot;didn&#x27;t want to write with [Mike] anymore, but of course Mike tried to hang on.&quot; Around this time, Wilson attempted to produce an album for Pamplin that would have featured the Honeys as backing vocalists.

===Hospitalizations and &quot;cocaine sessions&quot;===
Wilson entered a period of regression over the subsequent years—particularly, after the band&#x27;s disastrous tour of Australia in 1978—and found ways of obtaining cocaine and barbiturates without the knowledge of his handlers. In mid-1978, a day after he overdosed on a combination of drugs, he disappeared from his family and went hitchhiking in West Hollywood, ultimately arriving at a gay bar, where he played piano for drinks. After this, he was driven to Mexico by a bar patron, and then hitchhiked to San Diego. Days later, police officers discovered Wilson lying under a tree in Balboa Park without shoes, money, or a wallet. They promptly took him to Alvarado Hospital for detox from alcohol poisoning. Once discharged, Wilson immediately joined his bandmates for the recording of &quot;L.A. (Light Album)&quot; (March 1979), but after producing some demos and early recordings, requested that Bruce Johnston helm the project.

With his marriage disintegrated, Wilson moved from his mansion on Bellagio Road to a small house on Sunset Boulevard, where he descended further into alcoholism. Following an incident in which he attacked his doctor during a visit, Wilson spent several months institutionalized at Brotzman Memorial Hospital. He was initially admitted in November 1978 for three months, discharged for one month, and then readmitted. While there, in January 1979, Stan Love and Rocky Pamplin were dismissed of their services. Wilson was released from the hospital in March. Afterward, he rented a house in Santa Monica and was arranged to be taken care of by a &quot;round-the-clock&quot; psychiatric nursing team. Later, he purchased a home in Pacific Palisades. His bandmates implored him to produce their next album, &quot;Keepin&#x27; the Summer Alive&quot; (March 1980), but he was unable or unwilling.

Wilson remained engrossed in his overeating and drug habits, influenced partly by Dennis. To motivate Wilson in his musical endeavors, Dennis occasionally offered him McDonald&#x27;s hamburgers and cocaine. Jon Stebbins&#x27; biography of Dennis describes clandestine recording sessions between the brothers, which were hidden due to efforts by &quot;certain members of the Beach Boys clan&quot; to keep them apart. Discovering their collaboration often led to a halt in the proceedings. Bootlegged tapes of the brothers&#x27; collaborations—produced in 1980 and 1981 at the Venice Beach home studio of musicologist and film executive Garby Leon—were later referred to as the &quot;cocaine sessions&quot; or &quot;hamburger sessions&quot; by Beach Boys fans.

In early 1981, Pamplin and Stan Love were convicted of assaulting Dennis in his home after the former bodyguards had heard that Dennis had been supplying Wilson with drugs. In early 1982, Wilson signed a trust document that gave Carl control of his finances and Brother Records, Inc. (BRI) voting power, and was involuntarily admitted to a three-day stay at St. John&#x27;s Hospital in Santa Monica. By this time, Wilson&#x27;s diet included up to four or five steaks a day, as well as copious amounts of ice cream, cookies, and cakes. At the end of the year, his weight exceeded .

==1982–1991: Second Landy intervention==

===Recovery and the Wilson Project===

In 1982, after Wilson overdosed on a combination of alcohol, cocaine, and other psychoactive drugs, his family and management successfully coordinated an elaborate ruse to convince him to volunteer back into Landy&#x27;s program. When approached by the band, Landy had agreed to treat Wilson again, but only if he was to be given total control over Wilson&#x27;s affairs without interference from anyone. Additionally, Landy promised that he would need no more than two years to rehabilitate Wilson. On November 5, Wilson was falsely told by the group that he was penniless and no longer a member of the Beach Boys, and if he wanted to continue receiving his share of income from the touring band&#x27;s earnings, he had to reenlist Landy as his caretaker.

Wilson acquiesced and was subsequently taken to Hawaii, where he was isolated from friends and family and put on a rigorous diet and health regimen. Coupled with counseling sessions, which involved reteaching Wilson basic social etiquette, this therapy was successful in bringing him back to physical health. By March 1983, he had returned to Los Angeles and was moved by Landy into a home in Malibu, where Wilson lived with several of Landy&#x27;s aides and was cut off from contacting many of his own friends and family, including his children and ex-wife Marilyn.

Between 1983 and 1986, Landy charged about $430,000 annually (equivalent to $ in ). When Landy requested more money, Carl Wilson was obliged to give away a quarter of Wilson&#x27;s publishing royalties. Landy soon extended to being Wilson&#x27;s creative and financial partner. Eventually, Landy became his representative at BRI corporate meetings. Landy was accused of creating a Svengali-like environment for Wilson, controlling every movement in his life, including his musical direction. Responding to such allegations, Wilson said, &quot;People say that Dr. Landy runs my life, but the truth is, I&#x27;m in charge.&quot; He later claimed that, in mid-1985, he attempted suicide by swimming out to sea as far as he could before one of Landy&#x27;s aides brought him back to shore.

As Wilson&#x27;s recovery consolidated, he actively participated in the recording of the album &quot;The Beach Boys&quot; (June 1985). The publicity surrounding the release labelled it as a &quot;comeback&quot; for Wilson. Afterward, he stopped working with his bandmates on a regular basis to focus on launching a solo career with Landy&#x27;s assistance. Starting in 1986, Wilson engaged his former collaborator Gary Usher in writing songs and recording demos for his prospective solo album at Usher&#x27;s studio. They recorded about a dozen songs in varying stages of completion, most of which remain unreleased. This collection of recordings came to be known as &quot;the Wilson Project&quot;.

===&quot;Brian Wilson&quot; and &quot;Sweet Insanity&quot;===

During this period, Wilson occasionally joined his bandmates at concerts, and he performed his first gig as a solo artist at several charity concerts around Los Angeles. In January 1987, Wilson agreed to a solo contract offered by Sire Records president Seymour Stein, who stipulated his own choice of co-producer, multi-instrumentalist Andy Paley, to keep Wilson on-task. In exchange, Landy was allowed to take on an &quot;executive producer&quot; role. Other producers, including Russ Titelman and Lenny Waronker, were soon involved, and difficulties between them and Landy ensued throughout the recording sessions.

Released in July 1988, &quot;Brian Wilson&quot; was met with favorable reviews and moderate sales, peaking at number 52 in the U.S. It included &quot;Rio Grande&quot;, an eight-minute Western suite written in a similar vein to the songs from &quot;Smile&quot;. The LP&#x27;s release was largely overshadowed by the controversy surrounding Landy and the success of the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Kokomo&quot;, the band&#x27;s first number-one hit since &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, and their first hit that had no involvement from Wilson.

In 1989, Wilson and Landy formed the company Brains and Genius, by which time Landy had ceased to be Wilson&#x27;s therapist on legal record and had surrendered his license to practice psychology in the state of California. Together, they worked on Wilson&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;Sweet Insanity&quot;, with Landy co-writing almost all of the material. Sire rejected the album due to Landy&#x27;s lyrics and the inclusion of Wilson&#x27;s rap song &quot;Smart Girls&quot;. In May 1989, Wilson recorded &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Little Girl&quot; for the film &quot;She&#x27;s Out of Control&quot;, and in June, was among the featured guests on the charity single &quot;The Spirit of the Forest&quot;.

By 1990, Wilson was estranged from the Beach Boys, with his bandmates deliberately scheduling recording sessions that Wilson could not attend. According to Brother Records president Elliot Lott, the band also twice rejected Wilson&#x27;s offers to produce an album for them.

===Lawsuits and conservatorship===
Throughout the 1990s, Wilson was embroiled in numerous lawsuits. In August 1989, he filed a $100 million suit against Irving Music to recover the song publishing rights that had been sold by his father decades earlier. Although Wilson failed to recover the rights, he was awarded $10 million through an out of court settlement in April 1992.

In October 1991, Wilson&#x27;s first memoir &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t It Be Nice: My Own Story&quot; was published. According to biographer Peter Ames Carlin, in addition to plagiarizing excerpts from earlier biographies, the contents of the book ranged from Wilson&#x27;s castigations against his bandmates to passages that &quot;read like depositions for their various court cases&quot;. The book prompted defamation lawsuits from Love, Al Jardine, Carl Wilson, and his mother Audree Wilson. Following a conservatorship suit filed by Wilson&#x27;s family in May 1991, Wilson and Landy&#x27;s partnership was dissolved in December, with a restraining order enacted soon thereafter.

A month after Wilson was awarded $10 million from his Irving Almo lawsuit, in May 1992, he was sued by Mike Love for decades-long neglected royalties and songwriting credits. In December 1994, the jury ruled in favor of Love, who was awarded $5 million and a share of future royalties from Wilson. Another lawsuit, this time filed by Wilson against his former conservator Jerome Billet, was enacted in September 1995. Wilson sought $10 million, alleging that Billet &quot;failed to supervise the lawyers&quot; overseeing the suits between Wilson, Irving Music, and Love. According to his second wife Melinda, when she and Wilson married in 1995, &quot;we were in the midst of nine separate lawsuits&quot; that were not all resolved until the early 2000s.

==1992–2019: Career resurgence and touring==

===Paley sessions, &quot;Orange Crate Art&quot;, and &quot;Imagination&quot;===
Wilson&#x27;s productivity increased significantly following his disassociation from Landy. The day after the restraining order had been placed on Landy, Wilson had renewed his songwriting partnership with Andy Paley and, together, subsequently wrote and recorded a large collection of material for a proposed Beach Boys album throughout the early to mid-1990s. Concurrently, Wilson worked with Don Was on a documentary about his life, &quot;Brian Wilson: I Just Wasn&#x27;t Made for These Times&quot; (1995). The soundtrack consisted of rerecordings of Beach Boys songs and was released as Wilson&#x27;s second solo album in August. In 1993, Wilson accepted an offer to record an album of songs written by Van Dyke Parks. Credited to the pair, &quot;Orange Crate Art&quot; was released in October 1995. In the late 1990s, Wilson and Asher rekindled their writing partnership and wrote some songs together. One of them &quot;Everything I Need&quot;, appeared on &quot;The Wilsons&quot; (1997), a project by his daughters Carnie and Wendy and featuring select appearances and contributions from Wilson.

Although some recordings were completed with the Beach Boys, the Wilson/Paley project was ultimately abandoned. Instead, Wilson co-produced the band&#x27;s 1996 album &quot;Stars and Stripes Vol. 1&quot; with Joe Thomas, owner of River North Records and former professional wrestler. In 1997, Wilson moved to St. Charles, Illinois to work on a solo album project with Thomas. Released in June 1998, Wilson described his third album, &quot;Imagination&quot;, as &quot;really a Brian Wilson/Joe Thomas album.&quot; It peaked at number 88 in the U.S. and was criticized by fans for its homogenized radio pop sound. Shortly before the album&#x27;s release, Wilson suffered the loss of what remained of his immediate family with the deaths of his brother Carl and their mother Audree.

Numerous reports from this period suggested that Wilson was being pressured to have a career and exploited by those close to him, including Melinda. Wilson&#x27;s daughter Carnie referred to Ledbetter as &quot;Melandy&quot;, and Ginger Blake, a family friend, characterized Wilson as &quot;complacent and basically surrendered&quot;. Mike Love stated that he was in favor of reuniting the Beach Boys with Wilson, but that &quot;Brian usually has someone in his life who tells him what to do. And now that person kinda wants to keep him away from us. I don&#x27;t know why. You&#x27;d have to ask her, I guess.&quot; Asked if he still considered himself a Beach Boy, Wilson replied, &quot;No. Maybe a little bit.&quot;

From March to July 1999, Wilson embarked on his first ever solo tour, playing about a dozen dates in the U.S. and Japan. His supporting band consisted of former Beach Boys touring musician Jeff Foskett (guitar), Wondermints members Darian Sahanaja (keyboards), Nick Walusko (guitar), Mike D&#x27;Amico (percussion, drums), and Probyn Gregory (guitar, horns), and Chicago-based session musicians Scott Bennett (various), Paul Mertens (woodwinds), Bob Lizik (bass), Todd Sucherman (drums), and Taylor Mills (backing vocals). Wilson toured the U.S. again in October. In 2000, Wilson said that the tours &quot;so far [have] been great. I feel much more comfortable on stage now. I have a good band behind me. It&#x27;s a much better band than the Beach Boys were.&quot;

In August 1999, Wilson filed suit against Thomas, seeking damages and a declaration which freed him to work on his next album without involvement from Thomas. Thomas reciprocated with his own suit, citing that Ledbetter had &quot;schemed against and manipulated&quot; him and Wilson. The case was settled out of court.
===Live albums and &quot;Brian Wilson Presents Smile&quot;===

Early in 2000, Wilson released his first live album, &quot;Live at the Roxy Theatre&quot;. Later in the year, he embarked on a series of U.S. concert dates that included the first full live performances of &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, with Wilson backed by a 55-piece orchestra. Van Dyke Parks was commissioned to write an overture arrangement of Wilson&#x27;s songs. Critic Geoff Edgers wrote that the historical importance of the tour was comparable to that of Syd Barrett or J.D. Salinger emerging from their decades-long reclusion. Although the tour was positively received by critics, it was poorly attended, and financial losses ran up to hundreds of thousands of dollars. In March 2001, Wilson attended a tribute show held in his honor at the Radio City Music Hall in New York, where he sang &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; before a public audience for the first time in decades.

The &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; tour was followed by another in 2002, this time playing in Europe, with a sold-out four-night residency at the Royal Festival Hall in London. Recordings from these concerts were released in the form of a second live album, &quot;Brian Wilson Presents Pet Sounds Live&quot; (June 2002). Over the next year, Wilson continued sporadic recording sessions for his fourth solo album, &quot;Gettin&#x27; In over My Head&quot;. Released in June 2004, the record featured guest appearances from Van Dyke Parks, Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, and Elton John. Some of the songs were leftovers from Wilson&#x27;s past collaborations with Paley and Thomas.

To the surprise of his associates, Wilson agreed to follow the &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; tours with concert dates that would feature songs from the unfinished &quot;Smile&quot; album arranged for live performance. Sahanaja assisted Wilson with the sequencing, and later, they were joined by Parks, who was brought in to contribute additional lyrics. &quot;Brian Wilson Presents Smile&quot; (&quot;BWPS&quot;) premiered at the Royal Festival Hall in London in February 2004. Encouraged by the positive reception, a studio album adaptation was soon recorded. Wilson&#x27;s engineer Mark Linett recalled that when he handed Wilson the CD of the completed album, &quot;I swear you could see something change in him. And he&#x27;s been different ever since.&quot; According to Sahanaja, Wilson held the CD to his chest and said, I&#x27;m going to hold this dear to my heart.&#x27; He was trembling.&quot;

Released in September, &quot;BWPS&quot; debuted at number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the highest chart position of any album by the Beach Boys or Brian Wilson since 1976&#x27;s &quot;15 Big Ones&quot;, and the highest ever debut for a Beach Boys-related album. It was later certified platinum. In support of &quot;BWPS&quot;, Wilson embarked on a world tour that included stops in the US, Europe, and Japan. Sahanaja told &quot;Australian Musician&quot;, &quot;In six years of touring this is the happiest we&#x27;ve ever seen Brian, I mean consistently happy&quot;. In July 2005, Wilson performed a concert at Live 8 in Berlin watched by a television audience of about three million.

In September 2005, Wilson arranged a charity drive to aid victims of Hurricane Katrina, wherein people who donated $100 or more would receive a personal phone call from Wilson. According to the website, over $250K was raised. In November, Mike Love sued Wilson over &quot;shamelessly misappropriating [...] Love&#x27;s songs, likeness, and the Beach Boys trademark, as well as the &#x27;Smile&#x27; album itself&quot; in the promotion of &quot;BWPS&quot;. The lawsuit was ultimately dismissed on grounds that it was meritless.

===Covers albums, &quot;That Lucky Old Sun&quot;, and Beach Boys reunion===
In October 2005, Arista Records released Wilson&#x27;s album &quot;What I Really Want for Christmas&quot;, which contained two new originals by Wilson. To celebrate the 40th anniversary of &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, Wilson embarked on a brief tour in November 2006. Al Jardine accompanied Wilson for the tour. In 2007, the Southbank Centre in London commissioned Wilson to create another song cycle in the style of &quot;Smile&quot;. With Scott Bennett, Wilson reconfigured a collection of songs that they had recently written and recorded together. The result, &quot;That Lucky Old Sun&quot;, was a semi-autobiographical conceptual piece about California. One year after Wilson premiered the work in London, a studio-recorded version of the piece was released as his seventh solo album in September 2008. It received generally favorable reviews.

Around this time, Wilson announced that he was developing another concept album, titled &quot;Pleasure Island: A Rock Fantasy&quot;. Accordingly: &quot;It&#x27;s about some guys who took a hike, and they found a place called Pleasure Island. And they met all kinds of chicks, and they went on rides and—it&#x27;s just a concept. I haven&#x27;t developed it yet. I think people are going to love it—it could be the best thing I&#x27;ve ever done.&quot;

In 2009, Wilson was asked by Walt Disney Records to record an album of Disney songs. He accepted on the condition that he could also record an album of George Gershwin songs as part of the deal. The latter, &quot;Brian Wilson Reimagines Gershwin&quot;, was released in August 2010; it reached number 26 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and topped &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Jazz Albums chart. Wilson embarked on a concert tour in which he performed the album in its entirety. In October 2011, the record was followed by &quot;In the Key of Disney&quot;, which peaked at number 83 in the U.S. The album was largely overshadowed by the release of &quot;The Smile Sessions&quot; one week later.

Whether Wilson had truly consented to his semi-regular touring schedule since the 2000s remained a subject of debate among fans. Wilson himself frequently stated that he enjoyed live performances; however, writing in his 2011 book about the Beach Boys, Jon Stebbins concluded, &quot;His handlers, managers, and wife insist that he works. It&#x27;s all a bit Landy-like when you look behind the curtain.&quot; Stebbins referred to a &quot;recent interview [in which Brian was asked] what he disliked the most about touring, [and] Brian replied that it was going on stage and performing. [...] Upon hearing Brian say that, his &#x27;handler&#x27; quickly reminded Brian, through a fake smile, that he loved performing.&quot; Jeff Foskett rebuked such accusations in a 2011 interview.

In mid-2011, Wilson reunited with his bandmates Mike Love, Al Jardine, David Marks, and Bruce Johnston to re-record &quot;Do It Again&quot; surreptitiously for a potential 50th anniversary album. Rumors that the group would reunite for a world tour soon appeared in the music press. Wilson stated in a September report that he was not participating in the tour with his bandmates. &quot;I don&#x27;t really like working with the guys, but it all depends on how we feel and how much money&#x27;s involved. Money&#x27;s not the only reason I made records, but it does hold a place in our lives.&quot; Wilson ultimately agreed to the tour, which lasted until September 2012, and an album, &quot;That&#x27;s Why God Made the Radio&quot;, released in June 2012. By then, Wilson had renewed his creative partnership with Joe Thomas. Although Wilson was listed as the album&#x27;s producer, Thomas was credited with &quot;recording&quot;, while Mike Love was &quot;executive producer&quot;. Most of the musicians in the reunion touring band were from Wilson&#x27;s solo band, with two (Scott Totten and John Cowsill) being from Love&#x27;s band.

=== &quot;No Pier Pressure&quot; and &quot;Pet Sounds 50th Anniversary World Tour&quot; ===

In June 2013, Wilson&#x27;s website announced that he was recording and self-producing new material with Don Was, Al Jardine, David Marks, former Beach Boy Blondie Chaplin, and guitarist Jeff Beck. It stated that the material might be split into three albums: one of new pop songs, another of mostly instrumental tracks with Beck, and another of interwoven tracks dubbed &quot;the suite&quot; which initially began form as the closing four tracks of &quot;That&#x27;s Why God Made the Radio&quot;. In January 2014, Wilson declared in an interview that the Beck collaborations would not be released.

In September 2014, Wilson attended the premiere of the Bill Pohlad-directed biopic of his life, &quot;Love &amp; Mercy&quot;, at the Toronto International Film Festival. Wilson had contributed a song to the film, &quot;One Kind of Love&quot;, that was nominated for Best Original Song at the 2016 Golden Globe Awards. In October 2014, BBC released a newly recorded version of &quot;God Only Knows&quot; with guest appearances by Wilson, Brian May, Elton John, Jake Bugg, Stevie Wonder, Lorde, and many others. It was recorded to celebrate the launch of BBC Music. A week later, Wilson was featured as a guest vocalist on the Emile Haynie single &quot;Falling Apart&quot;. Wilson&#x27;s cover of Paul McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Wanderlust&quot; was released on the tribute album &quot;The Art of McCartney&quot; in November.

Released in April 2015, &quot;No Pier Pressure&quot; marked another collaboration between Wilson and Joe Thomas, featuring guest appearances from Jardine, Marks, Chaplin, and others. Fans reacted negatively to the announcement that Wilson would be recording a duets album, describing it as a &quot;cash-in&quot;. A Facebook post attributed to Wilson responded to the feedback: &quot;In my life in music, I&#x27;ve been told too many times not to fuck with the formula, but as an artist it&#x27;s my job to do that.&quot; The album reached the U.S. top 30, but critical reaction was mixed due to the adult contemporary arrangements and excessive use of autotune. Later in the year, Sahanaja was asked if Wilson was reaching the end of his career as a performing artist. He answered, &quot;I gotta be honest. Each of the past five years I thought to myself, &#x27;Well, this is probably going to be it.&#x27;&quot;

In March 2016, Wilson and Al Jardine embarked on the Pet Sounds 50th Anniversary World Tour, promoted as his final performances of the album, with Chaplin appearing as a special guest at all dates on select songs. In October, his second memoir, &quot;I Am Brian Wilson&quot;, was published. It was written by journalist Ben Greenman through several months of interviews with Wilson. Also in October, Wilson announced a new album, &quot;Sensitive Music for Sensitive People&quot;, comprising originals and rock and roll cover songs. He described the name as a &quot;working title&quot; and said that recording would begin in December.

Asked about negative remarks made against him in Wilson&#x27;s book, Love disputed that Wilson&#x27;s printed statements were actually spoken by him and suggested that Wilson is &quot;not in charge of his life, like I am mine. [...] But, I don&#x27;t like to put undue pressure on him [...] because I know he has a lot of issues.&quot; During the filming of the 2021 documentary &quot;Brian Wilson: Long Promised Road&quot;, Wilson remarked that he had not &quot;had a friend to talk to in three years.&quot;

In a 2016 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, Wilson responded to a question about retiring, saying, &quot;If I retired I wouldn&#x27;t know what to do with my time. What would I do? Sit there and go, &#x27;Oh, I don&#x27;t want to be 74&#x27;? I&#x27;d rather get on the road and do concerts and take airplane flights.&quot; Similarly, in 2017, Wilson told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that he had not written a song since 2012, but still had no intentions of retiring from the road. In 2019, Wilson embarked on a co-headlining tour with the Zombies, performing selections from &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot;.

== 2020s: &quot;At My Piano&quot;, UMPG sale, and dementia==

Around this time, Wilson had two back surgeries that left him unable to traverse without a walker. In 2019, Wilson postponed some concert dates due to worsening mental health. His social media conveyed that he was grappling with unfamiliar internal struggles and occasionally speaking without intent, with the reason still uncertain. The next month, his social media declared that he had recovered and would resume touring.

Wilson was still performing concerts at the time the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in early 2020. He resumed his concert touring in August 2021, with many dates rescheduled to the next year. Two releases followed in November. The first, &quot;At My Piano&quot;, was issued by Decca and consists of new instrumental rerecordings of Wilson&#x27;s songs played by himself on piano. The second was the soundtrack to &quot;Long Promised Road&quot;, which includes new and previously unreleased recordings by Wilson.

At the end of 2021, Wilson sold his publishing rights to Universal Music Publishing Group for $50 million. Wilson was paid almost $32 million for his songwriter share plus $19 million for his reversion rights (his ability to reclaim his song rights within a time period after signing them away under the Copyright Act of 1976). In 2022, his ex-wife Marilyn, who had been awarded half of his songwriting royalties, sued Wilson for $6.7 million after he sold his rights to UMPG.

On July 26, 2022, Wilson played his final concert as part of a joint tour with Chicago at the Pine Knob Music Theatre in Clarkston, Michigan, where he was reported to have &quot;sat rigid and expressionless&quot; throughout the performance. Days later, he cancelled his remaining tour dates for that year, with his management citing &quot;unforeseen health reasons&quot; as the reason. During a January 2023 appearance on a Beach Boys fan podcast, Wilson&#x27;s daughter Carnie reported that her father was &quot;probably not going to tour anymore, which is heartbreaking&quot;.

On January 30, 2024, Melinda Ledbetter died at their home. The following month, it was announced that Wilson had dementia and entered into another conservatorship, which began in May 2024.

&quot;Cows in the Pasture&quot;, the unfinished album Wilson had produced for Fred Vail in 1970, will be completed by Vail in 2024. Wilson is the executive producer and contributed new vocals to one of the tracks. The album&#x27;s release in 2025 will be accompanied by a docuseries about Vail and the album&#x27;s making.

==Musical influences==
===Early influences===
Chord-wise, Wilson&#x27;s main music influences come from rock and roll, doo-wop, and vocal-based jazz. At about age two, he heard Glenn Miller&#x27;s 1943 rendition of Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;, which had a profound emotional impact on him. Wilson said, &quot;It sort of became a general life theme [for me].&quot; As a child, his favorite artists included Roy Rogers, Carl Perkins, Bill Haley, Elvis Presley, Henry Mancini, and Rosemary Clooney. Asked for the first music that he had felt compelled to learn and sing repeatedly, Wilson answered with Haley&#x27;s 1954 recording of &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;. Most of Wilson&#x27;s education in music composition and jazz harmony came from deconstructing the harmonies of his favorite vocal group, the Four Freshmen, whose repertoire included songs by Gershwin, Jerome Kern, and Cole Porter.

Wilson credited his mother with introducing him to the Four Freshmen, and he attributed his love for harmonies and the human voice to the group, who he thought had a &quot;groovy sectional sound&quot;. Their 1956 album &quot;Freshmen Favorites&quot; was the first pop album that Wilson listened to in its entirety and he cited &quot;Voices in Love&quot; (1958) as &quot;probably the greatest single vocal album I&#x27;ve ever heard&quot;. He greatly admired their arranger, Dick Reynolds, and later employed his services for the Beach Boys&#x27; Christmas album and &quot;Adult/Child&quot;. It is likely that Wilson learned virtually the entirety of the Four Freshmen&#x27;s recorded repertoire up through 1961, after which his obsession with the group was reduced.

Inquired for his music tastes in 1961, Wilson replied, &quot;top 10&quot;, referring to essentially any of the top hits of the era. Particular favorites included many songs by Chuck Berry, the Coasters, and the Everly Brothers. Later in his career, Wilson recorded renditions of certain favorites, including the Everly Brothers&#x27; &quot;Devoted to You&quot; (1958), the Robins&#x27; &quot;Smokey Joe&#x27;s Cafe&quot; (1955), the Olympics&#x27; &quot;Hully Gully&quot; (1960), the Shirelles&#x27; &quot;Mama Said&quot; (1961), and the Regents&#x27; &quot;Barbara Ann&quot; (1961).

He disliked surf music when the Beach Boys began forming; in the estimation of biographer Timothy White, Wilson instead aspired for a &quot;new plateau midway between Gershwin and the best Four Freshmen material&quot;. Gershwin&#x27;s influence became more apparent in Wilson&#x27;s music later in his career, particularly after the 1970s, when he dedicated himself to learning the violin parts from &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; for the first time. In 1994, Wilson recorded a choral version of &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; with Van Dyke Parks.

===Spector and Bacharach===

Phil Spector&#x27;s influence on Wilson is well-documented. In a 1966 article, Wilson referred to Spector as &quot;the single most influential producer.&quot; He reaffirmed in 2000 that Spector was &quot;probably the biggest influence of all. ... Anybody with a good ear can hear that I was influenced by Spector. I would listen to his records and pick up ideas.&quot; Wilson particularly admired Spector&#x27;s treatment of &quot;the song as one giant instrument. ... Size was so important to him, how big everything sounded. And he had the best drums I ever heard.&quot; He often cited Spector&#x27;s Christmas album as his favorite album of all time.

Wilson stated that he was made aware of Spector&#x27;s records via Bob Norberg. According to White, the Crystals&#x27; Spector-produced 1964 hit &quot;He&#x27;s a Rebel&quot; had &quot;hit Brian hardest&quot;. Wilson recalled that when he then heard the Ronettes&#x27; 1963 hit &quot;Be My Baby&quot; for the first time through his car radio, he immediately pulled over to the side of the road and deemed it the greatest record he had ever heard. His 2016 memoir states that he met Spector only a few days later.

Contrary to most accounts, Spector&#x27;s engineer, Larry Levine, reported that Spector thought highly of Wilson and had been outspoken in his praise to &quot;anybody who would listen&quot;. Levine remembered that the two producers &quot;had a good rapport&quot; and that Wilson would often consult with Spector about his production methods at recording sessions. After Spector&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feelin&#x27;&quot; (1964) became a hit for the Righteous Brothers, Wilson personally phoned Spector&#x27;s co-writers, Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, to praise it as the &quot;greatest record ever&quot; and expressed a wish to be their co-writer on future songs. Wilson unsuccessfully submitted two of his compositions to the producer, &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry Baby&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Hurt My Little Sister&quot;, both written with the Ronettes in mind. In 1977, Wilson wrote a 1950s style love song, &quot;Mona&quot;, whose lyrics discuss some of his favorite songs by Spector, including &quot;Da Doo Ron Ron&quot; and &quot;Be My Baby&quot;.
Burt Bacharach is among the &quot;often-overlooked&quot; influences on Wilson&#x27;s music. He named Bacharach (along with Spector and Chuck Berry) as his main influences chord-wise. In 1966, he said, &quot;Burt Bacharach and Hal David are more like me. They&#x27;re also the best pop team—per se—today. As a producer, Bacharach has a very fresh, new approach.&quot; He later said that Bacharach&#x27;s work had a &quot;profound&quot; influence that &quot;got me going in a [different] direction.&quot; Wilson produced renditions of Bacharach&#x27;s &quot;My Little Red Book&quot; and &quot;Walk On By&quot; in 1967 and 1968, respectively, but left the recordings unreleased.

Asked for anybody&#x27;s songs that he wished he had written, Wilson listed three: &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feelin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Be My Baby&quot;, and Bacharach&#x27;s &quot;Here I Am&quot;.

===Others===
Wilson&#x27;s other significant musical influences include Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, Nelson Riddle, the Motown sound, Disney film soundtracks such as &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964), and soul musicians such as Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder. Wendy Carlos&#x27; 1969 album &quot;Switched-On Bach&quot;, described by Wilson as &quot;one of the most electrifying records&quot; he had ever heard, influenced his use of synthesizers.

Although it is often reported that the Beach Boys and the Beatles reciprocated each other&#x27;s musical developments, Wilson rebuked the suggestion that he had been influenced by his rivals. Wilson acknowledged that he had been deeply affected by the Beatles&#x27; cultural influence and stature. He recalled that he and Love immediately felt threatened by the Beatles and added that he knew the Beach Boys could never match the excitement created by the Beatles as performers, and that this realization led him to concentrate his efforts on trying to outdo them in the recording studio. In a 2002 interview, Wilson said that each new Beatles release, particularly over 1964–65, pushed him &quot;to try something new&quot; in his work. He commended Paul McCartney&#x27;s bass playing as &quot;technically fantastic&quot; and praised his stylistic versatility.

In 1976, Wilson commented that he felt contemporary popular music had lacked the artistic integrity it once had, with Queen&#x27;s &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; (1975) being one exception. In a 1988 interview, he named the 1982 compilation &quot;Stevie Wonder&#x27;s Original Musiquarium I&quot; and Paul Simon&#x27;s 1986 release &quot;Graceland&quot; among his ten favorite albums of all time. In 2007, he cited Billy Joel as his favorite pianist. , Wilson maintained that he does not listen to modern music, only &quot;oldies but goodies&quot;.

==Artistry==
===Compositional style===
Wilson&#x27;s writing process, as he described in 1966, started with finding a basic chord pattern and rhythm that he termed &quot;feels&quot;, or &quot;brief note sequences, fragments of ideas&quot;. He explained, &quot;once they&#x27;re out of my head and into the open air, I can see them and touch them firmly. They&#x27;re not &#x27;feels&#x27; anymore.&quot; He wrote later that he aspired to write songs that appear &quot;simple, no matter how complex it really is.&quot; In a 2009 interview, he stated that his favorite chord is E major seventh, while his favorite key signatures to play in are B, C, E, and E.

Common devices in Wilson&#x27;s musical structures include jazz chords, such as sevenths and ninths. Wilson attributed his use of minor seventh chords to his affinity for the music of Burt Bacharach. Chord inversions, particularly those featuring a tonic (I) with a fifth in the bass, are also prevalent in his work, again influenced by Bacharach, especially songs like &quot;Walk On By&quot; and &quot;This Guy&#x27;s in Love with You&quot; (1968). The flattened subtonic (VII), which is common in the music of the Four Freshmen and popular music in general, is the nondiatonic chord that appears the most in Wilson&#x27;s compositions. Sudden breaks into &quot;a cappella&quot; segments, again borrowed from the Four Freshmen, are another feature of his music, having been employed in &quot;Salt Lake City&quot; (1965) and &quot;Sloop John B&quot; (1966).

Many of Wilson&#x27;s compositions are marked by destabilized tonal centers, resulting in functional ambiguity. He frequently uses key changes within verses and choruses, including &quot;truck driver&#x27;s modulations&quot;, to create dynamic shifts in his music. Tertian movement is another recurring aspect of his style.

Wilson&#x27;s bass parts are often melodic and given prominent focus in his arrangements. He also applied chromaticism in his musical structures, including diminished seventh chords. His use of chromatic bass descents are most notably displayed in &quot;Our Prayer&quot; (1969). Other songs are characterized by &quot;syncopated exercises and counterpoints piled on top of jittery eighth-note clusters and loping shuffle grooves&quot;, features that producer Alan Boyd said took &quot;an almost manic edge&quot; in Wilson&#x27;s work during the 1970s.

Session player Carol Kaye noted of Wilson&#x27;s basslines, &quot;He took bass up another step. He saw it as integral in a symphonic orchestra. He used bass as the framework for a hit record. Very few people can write for bass, but his writing was beautiful. There are a lot of jazz musicians who admire him for it.&quot; Her colleague, keyboardist Don Randi, similarly expressed admiration for Wilson&#x27;s chord choices, referring to him as &quot;the Bill Evans of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;.

Some of Wilson&#x27;s songs incorporate a I – IV – I – V pattern, a formula derived from &quot;Da Doo Ron Ron&quot;, as well as a circle of fifths sequence that begins with the mediant (iii), inspired by &quot;Be My Baby&quot;. He frequently uses stepwise-falling melodic lines, stepwise diatonic rises like I – iii – IV – V, and whole-step root movements such as I – VII – VI – V. Numerous songs alternate between supertonic and dominant chords (ii – V) or tonic and flattened subtonic chords (I – VII), the latter featuring in the verses of &quot;Guess I&#x27;m Dumb&quot; and the intro to &quot;California Girls&quot;.

===Lyrics===

Wilson typically wrote songs in conjunction with another lyricist, although there are exceptions in which he composed both the music and words alone, including &quot;Surfer Girl&quot;, &quot;Girl Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Bugged at My Ol&#x27; Man&quot;, &quot;Busy Doin&#x27; Nothin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;This Whole World&quot;, &quot;&#x27;Til I Die&quot;, and &quot;Love and Mercy&quot;, among others. In his 2008 book &quot;Dark Mirror: The Pathology of the Singer-Songwriter&quot;, Donald Brackett identifies Wilson as &quot;the Carl Sandburg and Robert Frost of popular music—deceptively simple, colloquial in phrasing, with a spare and evocative lyrical style embedded in the culture that created it.&quot;

Most of Wilson&#x27;s songs relate to introspective themes. Although the Beach Boys were known for their surfing imagery, his songs typically avoided such topics when he wrote with collaborators outside of his band&#x27;s circle, such as in the 1963 songs &quot;Lonely Sea&quot; and &quot;In My Room&quot;. In several of his other songs, the male object or narrator is portrayed as a &quot;loser&quot;, such as on &quot;She Knows Me Too Well&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Hurt My Little Sister&quot;, &quot;Merry Christmas, Baby&quot;, and &quot;All Dressed Up for School&quot;. Brackett opined that although &quot;John Lennon came close&quot;, Wilson expressed &quot;intense fragility&quot; and &quot;emotional vulnerability&quot; to degrees that few other singer-songwriters had.

Other recurring themes in Wilson&#x27;s songs include feminine objectification, youthful innocence, slice of life stories or observations, and health and fitness. Unlike his contemporaries, social issues were never referenced in his lyrics. Wilson acknowledged that he had &quot;never been the type&quot; to preach social messages in his songs.

===Studios and musicians===

Wilson said, &quot;I was unable to really think as a producer up until the time where I really got familiar with Phil Spector&#x27;s work. That was when I started to design the experience to be a record rather than just a song.&quot; He often attended Spector&#x27;s recording sessions, taking notes on the producer&#x27;s arranging and recording methods (later dubbed the &quot;Wall of Sound&quot;), and adopted the same choice of studios and session musicians as Spector. This collective of studio musicians later became known as the Wrecking Crew.
Rather than using Gold Star Studios, Spector&#x27;s favorite studio, Wilson preferred working at the Studio 3 room of Western for its privacy and for the presence of staff engineer Chuck Britz. From 1962 to 1967, Britz acted as Wilson&#x27;s &quot;right-hand man&quot;. Although more technical recording details such as level mixing and microphone placement were usually handled by Britz, Wilson would adjust the configuration to a large extent. Once Britz assembled a preliminary recording setup, Wilson would take over the console, directing the session musicians from the booth using an intercom or non-verbal gestures after supplying them with chord charts. According to Britz, &quot;Brian would work with [the players] until he got the sound he wanted. The process often took hours.&quot;

Wilson first used the Wrecking Crew for his productions with the Honeys in March 1963. Two months later, during the sessions for &quot;Surfer Girl&quot;, he began gradually integrating these musicians on Beach Boys records. Still, the band members almost always performed the instrumentation on their records until 1965, when a typical Wilson session would necessitate about 11 or more different players. In 1966 and 1967, Wilson almost exclusively relied on the Wrecking Crew for the recording of the Beach Boys&#x27; backing tracks. After 1967, his use of these musicians was considerably reduced.

Wilson&#x27;s musicians, many of whom had studied in conservatories, were astounded by his abilities. Guitarist Jerry Cole said, &quot;we would walk out of Brian&#x27;s sessions shaking our heads, saying, &#x27;This son of a bitch is either crazy, or he&#x27;s an absolute genius.&#x27; And the latter came to pass.&quot; Wilson was exceptional in that he had never required the musicians to devise their own parts at sessions. Drummer Hal Blaine, however, recalled that all of the musicians &quot;helped arrange, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.&quot;

For his part, Wilson said that he would work out &quot;about a third&quot; of the finished arrangement of a song as he was writing it, leaving the rest to studio experimentation. He wrote in 1990, &quot;As I write a song, I write some of the instrumental piano and pluck some of the different notes for the arrangement. It&#x27;s impossible to lay the whole arrangement on the piano but you play just enough to get the overall feelin&#x27; of the record. It is an art in itself.&quot;

===Production style===
Wilson&#x27;s best-known productions typically employed instruments such as saxophones and bass harmonicas. He usually instructed Blaine to play only the snare and floor-tom afterbeats used on Spector&#x27;s records. Owing further to Spector&#x27;s influence, Wilson rarely used ride or crash cymbals in his work and often combined color tones (such as a banjo doubled with a harpsichord) to produce novel sounds. Among other practices that Wilson copied directly from Spector was recording two echo chambers simultaneously, as well as having standup bass and Fender bass play identical parts.

His bass parts were usually played with a hard plectrum, giving the instrument a more percussive sound, a practice he had drawn from Motown. Carol Kaye said, &quot;Brian would have me turn up the treble more than I normally would have on records where the deep bass parts sound like I&#x27;m playing with my fingers, and not the pick.&quot;

According to Wilson, after his first nervous breakdown in 1964, he endeavored to &quot;take the things I learned from Phil Spector&quot; and maximize his instrumental palette. In Priore&#x27;s assessment, Wilson reconfigured Spector&#x27;s Wall of Sound techniques in the pursuit of &quot;audio clarity&quot; and &quot;a more lush, comfortable feel&quot;. The 2003 book &quot;Temples of Sound&quot; states that Wilson distinguished himself from Spector through the usage of certain instruments, such as banjo, and by possessing a &quot;clean muscle&quot; missing in Spector&#x27;s work.

String ensembles were rarely used in Wilson&#x27;s productions prior to &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, and he did not usually record strings as part of the basic track, instead preferring to overdub them afterward. Once the instrumental track was completed, vocals would then be overdubbed. Beginning with the 1963 song &quot;Surfin&#x27; U.S.A.&quot;, Wilson double-tracked the vocals, resulting in a deeper and more resonant sound.

Starting in 1964, Wilson performed tape splices on his recordings, usually to allow difficult vocal sections to be performed by the group. By 1965, he had become more adventurous in his use of tape splicing, such as on the song &quot;And Your Dream Comes True&quot;, which was recorded in sections and then edited together to create the final song. These experiments culminated with the similar but more complex editing processes adopted for &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; and &quot;Smile&quot;. Mark Linett, who has engineered Wilson&#x27;s recordings since the 1980s, stated, &quot;He certainly wasn&#x27;t the first person to do edits, but it was unusual to record a song in four or five sections, and then cut it together.&quot;

===Singing===
Through listening to Four Freshmen records, Wilson developed a distinctive singing style—a versatile head voice that allowed him to sing high without engaging in falsetto, although he did also sing in falsetto on some Beach Boys songs. Wilson recalled that he &quot;learned how to sing falsetto&quot; through listening to the Four Freshmen&#x27;s renditions of songs like &quot;I&#x27;m Always Chasing Rainbows&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Remember April&quot;, and &quot;Day by Day&quot;. Another strong influence was Rosemary Clooney, who he said &quot;taught me to sing with love in my heart [...] I would sing along with [her recording of &quot;Hey There&quot;], studying her phrasing, and that&#x27;s how I learned to sing with feeling.&quot; In 1966, he said that the highest note he could sing was D5.

Wilson typically sang in a pure tenor voice until later in his adult life, when he began invoking his tenor only on rare occasions. He was sometimes embarrassed of being perceived as a homosexual, and would avoid performing in a high voice for this reason. After the early 1970s, Wilson&#x27;s voice degraded due to his excessive consumption of cigarettes and cocaine. &quot;15 Big Ones&quot; marked the introduction of what biographer Peter Ames Carlin terms Wilson&#x27;s &quot;baritone croak&quot;. In a 1999 interview, Wilson remarked, &quot;You know Bob Dylan? Well, live, you know, he sort of has this harsh, raspy voice. That&#x27;s what I have. I&#x27;m like the Bob Dylan of the &#x27;90s.&quot;

==Mental health==
===Onset of illness===
Wilson is diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and mild bipolar disorder. Since 1965, he has regularly experienced auditory hallucinations that present in the form of disembodied voices. These hallucinations are mainly derogatory, but sometimes positive, and have occasionally inspired songs. Wilson referred to the voices as &quot;heroes and villains&quot; that have caused &quot;a life of scare&quot;.

Gaines, in his 1986 biography of the Beach Boys, highlighted the challenge faced by Wilson&#x27;s family and associates in discerning genuine mental health issues from potential manipulative behavior on Wilson&#x27;s part. Wilson&#x27;s 1991 memoir suggests that his Houston flight incident from December 1964 made him realize that he could control others through displays of &quot;craziness&quot;. Subsequent to that incident, Marilyn arranged his first psychiatrist visit, where it was ruled that Wilson&#x27;s condition was due to work-related fatigue. Wilson typically refused counseling, and his family believed his idiosyncrasies stemmed from drug habits or were simply innate to his personality. Marilyn countered accusations of neglect on her part, emphasizing her repeated efforts to get him professional help and pointing out his capability to mislead medical professionals.

According to Wilson, he had been introduced to recreational drugs by an acquaintance during a Beach Boys tour. His hallucinations emerged early in 1965, about a week after his first time using psychedelics. Loren Schwartz, his supplier, said that Wilson&#x27;s first dosage was 125 micrograms of &quot;pure Owsley&quot; and resulted in &quot;full-on ego death&quot;. Mike Love observed signs of irregular behavior in Wilson by July, recalling an incident where Wilson deliberately crashed his car into a 7-Up machine at a gas station, an act Love deemed out of character. His drug use was initially concealed from his bandmates and family, including Love, who had thought Wilson to be strictly opposed to drugs.

Wilson, in 1990, attributed LSD to himself developing &quot;a Jesus Christ complex&quot; in the mid-1960s. Following the advice of Four Freshmen manager Bill Wagner, Wilson consulted with a UCLA psychiatrist on the adverse effects of LSD. The psychiatrist later told Wagner, &quot;I don&#x27;t know if he is savable. He gives me the impression he&#x27;s been on it for a while, and he&#x27;s entirely enamored of it.&quot; By 1966, Wilson acknowledged using &quot;pills&quot; for introspection rather than leisure and viewed psychedelic usage as benign. His 2016 memoir states that he abstained from consuming LSD for a second time until he was 23, around 1966 or 1967. Marilyn suspected he had numerous LSD experiences in the ensuing years, although she only knew of two such incidents at the time. Ledbetter, in 2004, claimed Wilson had taken LSD only thrice in his life.

As Wilson&#x27;s condition worsened, he grew susceptible to paranoid delusions, believing that his auditory hallucinations were Satan coming &quot;in the form of other people that were competing with me and had ideas of killing me.&quot; By 1968, following the birth of their first child, Marilyn&#x27;s concerns about Wilson&#x27;s mental health intensified. Wilson was hospitalized later that year and prescribed Thorazine for severe anxiety disorder. He may have self-admitted and possibly received treatments ranging from talking therapies to doses of lithium and electroconvulsive therapy during this stay.

===Post-Landy===
Following the mid-1970s, Wilson was given the since-retracted diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. He was given this diagnosis, in addition to manic-depressive psychosis, when he was a patient at Brotzman Memorial Hospital in 1978. Landy, in 1976, had initially refuted such a diagnosis, suggesting Wilson&#x27;s main issue was &quot;being scared&quot;. In 1984, doctors again misdiagnosed Wilson with schizophrenia, also finding evidence of brain damage caused by excessive and sustained drug use.

In the late 1980s, Wilson developed facial tics, called tardive dyskinesia, that were symptomatic of the excessive psychotropic medications Landy and his medical team had administered. Therapist Peter Reum, a fan who had met Wilson on several occasions, stated that Wilson would have deterioriated into a &quot;drooling, palsied mental patient&quot;, and potentially died of heart failure had he continued this drug regimen. In 1990, Stan Love, Wilson&#x27;s cousin, sued Wilson and attempted to gain conservatorship over him stating Wilson should not be in charge of his own affairs as Wilson was experiencing mental health issues and breakdowns. A court ultimately ruled against Love becoming Wilson&#x27;s conservator. In a 2002 interview speaking of the Landy program, Wilson stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t regret [the Landy program]. I loved the guy—he saved me.&quot; After Wilson sought medical care elsewhere, he was declared to have organic personality disorder. Musician Sean O&#x27;Hagan, who was invited to collaborate with Wilson in the 1990s, characterized Wilson as &quot;totally dependent on other people&quot;, with signs reminiscent of autism.

Wilson&#x27;s mental condition improved in later years, although his auditory hallucinations still persisted, especially when performing onstage. He credits his relationship with his second wife for allowing him to resume his career as a musician. In his own words, he said that he should have spent the early 2000s &quot;in a mental institution under heavy sedation&quot; due to the stresses of his condition; however, &quot;Things have started to get a little bit easier, but I&#x27;m not always in a positive, happy place.&quot; In 2002, he lamented that his successful treatment had inhibited his creativity and songwriting.

==Personal life==

===Deafness in right ear===
At age 11, during a Christmas choir recital, it was found that Wilson had significantly diminished hearing in his right ear. The issue was diagnosed as a nerve impingement by a family doctor. The exact cause remains unclear, but possible causes include a birth defect, an injury from his father, Murry, or another child.

It is improbable that Wilson was born partially deaf as such defects generally manifest earlier. Wilson himself believed the deafness might have resulted from his father slapping him shortly before turning three, although he also stated in a 2000 interview that his deafness had been present at birth and unrelated to his father&#x27;s physical abuse. Murry commented that the deafness may have resulted from a football game injury, while Wilson&#x27;s mother, Audree, said that Wilson believed the incident occurred when he was around 10 and a child hit his ear, a claim repeated in his 2016 memoir.

Due to this infirmity, Wilson developed a habit of speaking from the side of his mouth, giving the false impression that he had suffered a stroke. He also experiences tinnitus that worsens when he is fatigued or exposed to loud noises. In the late 1960s, he underwent corrective surgery that was unsuccessful in restoring his hearing.

===Relationships and children===

Wilson&#x27;s first serious relationship was with Judy Bowles, a high school student he had met at a baseball game in mid-1961. The couple were engaged during Christmas 1963 and were to be married the following December. She inspired his songs &quot;Judy&quot; (1962), &quot;Surfer Girl&quot; (1963), and, according to some accounts, &quot;The Warmth of the Sun&quot; (1964), the latter being written shortly after they had separated. Around then, he had gradually become romantically involved with another high school student, singer Marilyn Rovell, whom he had met in August 1962. Wilson&#x27;s &quot;All Summer Long&quot; (1964) referenced their first meeting with the lyric &quot;Remember when you spilled Coke all over your blouse?&quot; Inspired by a remark from Marilyn&#x27;s older sister Diane, Wilson wrote &quot;Don&#x27;t Hurt My Little Sister&quot; (1965) about his early relationship with Marilyn.

Wilson and Marilyn were married in December 1964. Together, they had two daughters, Carnie and Wendy (born 1968 and 1969, respectively), who later had musical success of their own as two-thirds of the group Wilson Phillips. His daughters inspired his songs &quot;Roller Skating Child&quot; (1977) and &quot;Little Children&quot; (1988).

Wilson characterized himself as a neglectful father and husband in his first marriage. Much of the lyrical content from &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; reflected the couple&#x27;s early marital struggles, which worsened in the subsequent years. He encouraged his wife to have affairs with other men, including songwriter Tandyn Almer. In turn, Wilson had an affair with her sister, the subject of his song &quot;My Diane&quot; (1978). Wilson simultaneously had another affair with telephone operator Debbie Keil who worked for the Beach Boys as a fan mail sorter from 1969 to 1970. To Marilyn&#x27;s chagrin, Wilson permitted Keil&#x27;s frequent visitations to the Wilson household, inspiring his song &quot;The Night Was So Young&quot; (1977). Keil contributed many of the anonymous quotes published in David Leaf&#x27;s 1978 biography &quot;The Beach Boys and the California Myth&quot;.

In July 1978, Wilson and Marilyn separated, with Wilson filing for divorce in January 1979. Marilyn was given custody of their children and a half share of Wilson&#x27;s songwriting royalties. He subsequently maintained a relationship with Keil until 1981. Following their separation, Wilson dated one of his nurses, Carolyn Williams, until January 1983.

Wilson initially dated former model and car saleswoman Melinda Kae Ledbetter from 1986 to late 1989. Ledbetter stated that the relationship ended prematurely due to interference from Landy. After Wilson parted ways with his psychologist, in 1991, he and Ledbetter reconnected and were married on February 6, 1995. After 1999, Ledbetter was Wilson&#x27;s manager, which she described as &quot;basically negotiating, and that&#x27;s what I did every single day when I sold cars.&quot; They adopted five children. By 2012, Wilson had six grandchildren, two daughters of Carnie and four sons of Wendy. Ledbetter died on January 30, 2024. In his social media, Wilson declared she &quot;was my savior. She gave me the emotional security I needed to have a career. She encouraged me to make the music that was closer to my heart&quot;.

Singer Linda Ronstadt&#x27;s 2013 memoir &quot;Simple Dreams&quot; implies that she briefly dated Wilson in the 1970s. Wilson contributed backing vocals to her 1989 single &quot;Adios&quot;.

===Beliefs===
Wilson was raised in a Presbyterian family. In many interviews, he has emphasized the spiritual essence of his music, particularly with &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. He was also intrigued by astrology, numerology, and the occult, as reflected in his original concepts for &quot;Smile&quot;. In 1966, Wilson expressed his belief that all music &quot;starts with religion&quot;, and while he recognized a &quot;higher being who is better than we are&quot;, he was not traditionally religious. Asked whether his music was religiously influenced in 1988, he referred to the 1962 book &quot;A Toehold on Zen&quot;, explaining that he believed that he possessed what is called a &quot;toehold&quot;, meaning that having &quot;a good grasp&quot; on one aspect of life can translate to others.

In the late 1960s, Wilson and his bandmates promoted Transcendental Meditation (TM). By 1968, he had equated religion and meditation, though he ultimately abandoned TM. He described himself in 1976 as having over-diversified his readings, maintaining then that he still believed, as he did in the 1960s, that the coming of &quot;the great Messiah [...] came in the form of drugs&quot; while acknowledging that his own drug experiences &quot;really didn&#x27;t work out so well, so positively&quot;. Friend Stanley Shapiro mentioned Wilson once composed a private song for God. Wilson endorsed &quot;sexual deprivation&quot; for cosmic awareness, and, in 1995, linked abstinence to his ability to function, calling it an &quot;Einsteinian formula&quot; that &quot;create[s] a void in your brain&quot;.

In 1999, when asked for his religious beliefs, Wilson responded: &quot;I believe in Phil Spector&quot;. Asked again, in 2011, he said that while he had spiritual beliefs, he did not follow any particular religion. Asked in 2004 for his favorite book, Wilson answered &quot;the Bible&quot;, and questioned if he believed in life after death, Wilson replied &quot;I don&#x27;t&quot;.

Wilson wrote &quot;The Warmth of the Sun&quot; as a tribute to John F. Kennedy following his assassination in 1963. Asked if he drew inspiration from modern politics in 2011, Wilson responded, &quot;Politics goes in one ear and out the other. I don&#x27;t even know the president&#x27;s name for sure. [laughs] That&#x27;s how stupid I am&quot;.

===Interviews===

Wilson has admitted to having a poor memory and occasionally lying in interviews to &quot;test&quot; people. David Oppenheim, recalling his 1966 interview with Wilson, remembered, &quot;we tried to talk with him but didn&#x27;t get much out of him. Some guy said &#x27;He&#x27;s not verbal. During his late 1970s comeback, Wilson remarked, &quot;Interviews are for publicity.&quot; At that time, he had often asked journalists for drugs during interviews, described by Leaf as &quot;a game&quot; on Wilson&#x27;s part, as an anonymous source suggested he had other means to obtain drugs. Journalist Verlyn Klinkenborg in 1988 observed that while Wilson was known for being brutally honest, what he believes to be true depends on his mood at the time and could vary dramatically if inquired on another occasion.

In later years, many writers have found Wilson challenging to interview, as his responses are usually curt or lacking in substance. Edgers wrote in 2000 that &quot;no writer will ever understand Brian Wilson&quot;, highlighting his often &quot;clipped and conflicting&quot; responses, adding that he &quot;generally makes it clear to interviewers that he would rather be somewhere else — and that&#x27;s when he&#x27;s feeling good.&quot; &quot;Salon&quot;&#x27;s Peter Gilstrap wrote in 2015 that Wilson had been known to end interviews abruptly, though the author concluded that his actions were not &quot;due to a bad attitude.&quot;.

In a 2007 interview, Wilson was asked about &quot;good movies&quot; he had watched recently and named &quot;Norbit&quot;. Then, asked his all-time favorite movie, he again answered &quot;Norbit&quot;. A later &quot;Spin&quot; piece, marking this exchange&#x27;s tenth anniversary, referred to it as a classic display of Wilson&#x27;s terseness and jokingly dubbed it &quot;one of the most important blog posts in recent American history&quot;.

==Cultural impact and influence==
===Sales achievements===
From 1962 to 1979, Wilson wrote or co-wrote more than two dozen U.S. Top 40 hits for the Beach Boys. Eleven of those reached the top 10, including the number-ones &quot;I Get Around&quot; (1964), &quot;Help Me, Rhonda&quot; (1965), and &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; (1966). Three more that he produced, but did not write, were the band&#x27;s &quot;Barbara Ann&quot; (number 2) in 1965, &quot;Sloop John B&quot; (number 3) in 1966, and &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot; (number 5) in 1976. Among his other top 10 hits, Wilson co-wrote Jan and Dean&#x27;s &quot;Surf City&quot; (the first chart-topping surf song) and &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Curve&quot; (number 8) in 1963, and the Hondells&#x27; &quot;Little Honda&quot; (number 9) in 1964.

===Popular music, industry practices, and record production===
Wilson is widely regarded as one of the most innovative and significant songwriters of the late 20th century. Fellow composers who have acknowledged his advancements include Philip Glass, Gustavo Dudamel, and Burt Bacharach, the latter of whom praised Wilson as &quot;one of the greatest innovators&quot; in music history. In discussing Wilson&#x27;s harmonic ingenuity, musicologist Philip Lambert states in 2016 that his harmonic approach demonstrated an exceptional mastery and significantly expanded upon the British-American pop idiom of the 1960s, leaving a lasting imprint on popular music since.

The level of creative control that Wilson had asserted over his own record output was unprecedented in the music industry, leading him to become the first pop artist credited for writing, arranging, producing, and performing his own material. Although there had been numerous examples of artists who were essentially &quot;self-produced&quot;, Wilson distinguished himself for having directed every phase of an album&#x27;s production. Furthermore, most of the written arrangements among 1960s rock groups were not composed by the artists themselves. Wilson&#x27;s autonomy encompassed control over recording studios and personnel, including engineers and the typically intrusive A&amp;R representative. According to biographer James Murphy, Wilson&#x27;s singular artistic freedom was pivotal in reshaping both the landscape of popular music and the music industry&#x27;s perception of artistic control.

In addition to being one of the first music producer &quot;auteurs&quot;, Wilson helped popularize the idea of the recording studio as a compositional tool, and he was the first rock producer to use the studio in this fashion. Granata writes that Wilson&#x27;s &quot;authoritative approach [...] affected his contemporaries&quot; and thus &quot;redefined&quot; the role of the producer. In his 2015 book &quot;Electric Shock&quot;, Peter Doggett identifies Wilson as the quintessential figure of an era marked by &quot;some of the most notorious pop battles&quot; between &quot;idealistic musicians&quot; and the executives funding their ambitious projects. Virgil Moorefield&#x27;s 2010 book &quot;The Producer as Composer: Shaping the Sounds of Popular Music&quot; acknowledges Wilson as a &quot;brilliant producer&quot; who significantly expanded the field of music production.

Beatles producer George Martin said, &quot;No one made a greater impact on the Beatles than Brian [...] the musician who challenged them most of all.&quot; Jimmy Webb explained, &quot;As far as a major, modern producer who was working right in the middle of the pop milieu, no one was doing what Brian was doing. We didn&#x27;t even know that it was possible until he did it.&quot; David Crosby called Wilson &quot;the most highly regarded pop musician in America. Hands down. Everybody by that time had figured out who was writing it all and who was arranging it all.&quot;

His accomplishments as a producer influenced many others in his field, effectively setting a precedent that allowed subsequent bands and artists to produce their own recording sessions, either autonomously or in conjunction with other like minds. Following his exercise of total creative autonomy, Wilson ignited an explosion of like-minded California producers, supplanting New York as the center of popular records. Wilson was also a pioneer of &quot;project&quot; recording, where an artist records by himself rather than at an established studio.

The 1967 CBS documentary &quot;Inside Pop: The Rock Revolution&quot;, hosted by the classical conductor Leonard Bernstein, described Wilson as &quot;one of today&#x27;s most important pop musicians.&quot; Artists who have described Wilson as a &quot;genius&quot; have included George Martin, Leon Russell, Eric Clapton, Pete Townshend, Jimmy Page, Elton John, Tom Petty, Henry Rollins, and Questlove. Many other musicians have voiced admiration for Wilson&#x27;s work or cited it as an influence, including Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Ray Davies, John Cale, David Byrne, Todd Rundgren, Patti Smith, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Bruce Springsteen, Randy Newman, Ray Charles, and Chrissie Hynde.

===Art pop, pop art, psychedelia, and progressive music===

Further to his invention of new musical textures and his novel applications of quasi-symphonic orchestras, Wilson helped propel the mid-1960s art pop movement, and, with &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, was immediately heralded as art rock&#x27;s leading figure. Carlin writes that Wilson had originated &quot;a new kind of art-rock that would combine the transcendent possibilities of art with the mainstream accessibility of pop music&quot;. Academic Larry Starr writes, &quot;In a sense, Brian Wilson was the first self-conscious second-generation rock &#x27;n&#x27; roller&quot; as well as &quot;the first fully realized&quot; example of both an innovative and majorly successful pop musician. Starr credits Wilson with establishing a successful career model that was then followed by the Beatles and other mid-1960s British Invasion acts. According to journalist Erik Davis, &quot;Not only did [he] write a soundtrack to the early &#x27;60s, but Brian let loose a delicate and joyful art pop unique in music history and presaged the mellowness so fundamental to &#x27;70s California pop.&quot;

Van Dyke Parks stated, &quot;Brian Wilson was not imitative, he was inventive; for people who don&#x27;t write songs, it&#x27;s hard to understand how inventive he really was.&quot; Parks elaborated that &quot;Wilson made music as accessible as a cartoon and yet rewarded repeated listening as much as Bach&quot;, also suggesting that Wilson&#x27;s sensibilities overlapped with those espoused by other pop artists of the era, including Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein. In his 1969 book &quot;Awopbopaloobop Alopbamboom: The Golden Age of Rock&quot;, Nik Cohn recognizes Wilson as a progenitor of authentic pop art, elevating high school-themed music &quot;to completely new levels&quot; and transforming it into a mythic narrative.

Under Wilson&#x27;s creative leadership, the Beach Boys became major contributors to the development of psychedelic music, although they are rarely credited for this distinction. In an editorial piece on sunshine pop, a subgenre closely associated with psychedelia, &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s Noel Murray recognized Wilson as among &quot;studio rats [that] set the pace for how pop music could and should sound in the Flower Power era: at once starry-eyed and wistful.&quot; Murray added that Wilson himself rarely produced true sunshine pop music, but was still &quot;hugely influential&quot; to the genre&#x27;s development.

Wilson&#x27;s work with the Beach Boys, especially on &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; and &quot;Smile&quot;, marked the beginnings of progressive pop, a genre that is distinguished by sophisticated and unorthodox approaches to pop music. Writing in 1978, David Leaf identified Wilson&#x27;s 1960s productions as a chief influence on bands such as Queen, Electric Light Orchestra (ELO), 10cc, and Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, among others. Musicologist Bill Martin, an author of books about progressive rock, acknowledged Wilson&#x27;s influence on the prog movement, particularly through his complex songwriting and basslines, adding that Wilson, alongside the Who frontman Pete Townshend, &quot;showed that adolescence can be the subject of great music&quot;.

Writing in 2016, &quot;The Atlantic&quot;″s Jason Guriel credits &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; with inventing the modern pop album, stating that Wilson &quot;paved the way for auteurs [and] anticipated the rise of the producer [and] the modern pop-centric era, which privileges producer over artist and blurs the line between entertainment and art.&quot; Among the later artists situated within Wilson&#x27;s template are Prince, Michael Jackson, Radiohead, and Kanye West.

===Naïve art, rock/pop division, and outsider music===

Wilson&#x27;s popularity and success is attributed partly to the perceived naïveté of his work and personality. In music journalist Barney Hoskyns&#x27; description, the &quot;particular appeal of Wilson&#x27;s genius&quot; can be traced to his &quot;singular naivety&quot; and &quot;ingenuousness&quot;, alongside his band being &quot;the very obverse of hip&quot;. Commenting on the seemingly &quot;campy and corny&quot; quality of the Beach Boys&#x27; early records, David Marks said that Wilson had been &quot;dead serious about them all&quot;, elaborating, &quot;It&#x27;s hard to believe that anyone could be that naive and honest, but he was. That&#x27;s what made those records so successful. You could feel the sincerity in them.&quot; John Cale supported, &quot;What Brian came to mean was an ideal of naïveté and innocence [...] &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; was adult and childlike at the same time.&quot;

The most culturally significant &quot;tragedy&quot; in 1960s rock, according to journalist Richard Goldstein, was Wilson&#x27;s failure to overcome his insecurities and realize &quot;his full potential as a composer&quot; after having anticipated developments such as electronica and minimalism. Writing in 1981, sociomusicologist Simon Frith identified Wilson&#x27;s withdrawal in 1967, along with Phil Spector&#x27;s self-imposed retirement in 1966, as the catalysts for the &quot;rock/pop split that has afflicted American music ever since&quot;. Frith added that, while the influence of both these producers was evident in 1967 hit songs by the Electric Prunes, the Turtles, Strawberry Alarm Clock, Tommy James and the Shondells, and the 5th Dimension, the most enduring and successful American pop act was the Monkees, which had been created as &quot;an obvious imitation of the Beatles&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frith/HistoryOfRock&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking in a 1997 interview, musician Sean O&#x27;Hagan felt that rock music&#x27;s domination of mass culture following the mid-1960s had the effect of artistically stifling contemporary pop composers who, until then, had been guided by Wilson&#x27;s increasingly ambitious creative advancements. In her article which dubbed him &quot;the godfather of sensitive pop&quot;, music journalist Patricia Cárdenas credits Wilson with ultimately inspiring many musicians to value the craft of pop songwriting as much as &quot;the primal, hard-driving rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll the world had come to know since then.&quot;

By the mid-1970s, Wilson had tied with ex-Pink Floyd member Syd Barrett for rock music&#x27;s foremost &quot;mythical casualty&quot;. Timothy White wrote that Wilson&#x27;s ensuing legend rivaled that of the California myth promoted by the Beach Boys, while Brackett characterized Wilson&#x27;s &quot;rise and fall and rise&quot; as a &quot;downright Shakespearean&quot; story, with Wilson &quot;elevated to Olympian status by every serious musician since&quot;.

Ultimately, Wilson became regarded as the most famous outsider musician. Author Irwin Chusid, who codified the term &quot;outsider music&quot;, noted Wilson as a potentially unconvincing example of the genre due to Wilson&#x27;s commercial successes, but argued that the musician should be considered an outsider due to his &quot;tormented&quot; background, past issues with drug dependencies, and unorthodox songwriting. Other critics have drawn comparisons between Wilson and the outsider musician Daniel Johnston, who also struggled with lifelong mental illness and a &quot;genius&quot; labeling.

===Alternative music and continued cultural resonance===

Wilson has also been declared the &quot;godfather&quot; of punk, indie rock, and emo. Principally through his early records, Wilson, alongside his collaborator Mike Love, was a key influence on the development of punk rock and the movement&#x27;s evolution into indie rock. According to critic Carl Wilson (no relation to the Beach Boys&#x27; Carl Wilson), &quot;The Ramones, for instance, seized on and subverted the early Wilson template: Be True to Your School became Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll High School.&quot; The critic also notes, &quot;For the artier branches of post-punk, Wilson&#x27;s pained vulnerability, his uses of offbeat instruments and his intricate harmonies, not to mention the &quot;Smile&quot; saga itself, became a touchstone&quot;, especially for such bands as Pere Ubu, XTC, U2, R.E.M., the Pixies, and My Bloody Valentine.

Later in the 20th century, Wilson was credited with &quot;godfathering&quot; an era of independently produced music that was heavily indebted to his melodic sensibilities, chamber pop orchestrations, and recording experiments. Author Nathan Wiseman-Trowse credited Wilson, alongside Spector, with having &quot;arguably pioneered&quot;, in popular music, the &quot;approach to the sheer physicality of sound&quot;, an integral characteristic of the dream pop genre. Newer acts who were influenced by Wilson, or that voiced their admiration, included Robyn Hitchcock, Redd Kross, the Church, Rain Parade, Big Dipper, the Go-Betweens, Psychic TV, the Feelies, and the dBs.

Many of the most popular acts of the 1980s and 1990s recorded songs that celebrated or referenced Wilson&#x27;s music, including R.E.M., Bruce Springsteen, Barenaked Ladies, the Jayhawks, and Wilco. Simultaneously, the High Llamas inspired many American touring groups, especially around Los Angeles, to recognize Wilson as an &quot;alternative music hero&quot;. Stereolab and the Elephant 6 collective, whose roster included Apples in Stereo, of Montreal and the Olivia Tremor Control, were all heavily influenced by Wilson. In Japan, references to Wilson and his &quot;mad boy genius&quot; legend became a common trope among musicians such as Cornelius, who was heralded by critics as &quot;the Japanese Brian Wilson&quot;. In 2000, Marina Records released &quot;Caroline Now!&quot;, an album of Wilson&#x27;s songs recorded by artists including Alex Chilton, Kim Fowley, the Aluminum Group, Eric Matthews, Saint Etienne, Peter Thomas, the High Llamas, and Jad Fair of Half Japanese.

Thanks to acts such as Panda Bear and his 2007 album &quot;Person Pitch&quot;, Wilson began to be recognized for his continued impact on the indie music vanguard since the late 2000s. In 2009, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ran an editorial feature that traced the development of nascent indie music scenes, and chillwave in particular, to the themes of Wilson&#x27;s songs and his reputation for being an &quot;emotionally fragile dude with mental health problems who coped by taking drugs.&quot; Writing in his 2011 book on the Beach Boys, Mark Dillon stated that tributes to Wilson remained &quot;common among musicians young enough to be his children&quot;.

Wilson&#x27;s influence continues to be attributed to modern dream pop acts such as Au Revoir Simone, Wild Nothing, Alvvays, and Lana Del Rey. In 2022, She &amp; Him, accompanied by the release of &quot;Melt Away: A Tribute to Brian Wilson&quot;, embarked on a concert tour dedicated to renditions of Wilson&#x27;s songs.

<text>A rangefinder camera is a camera fitted with a rangefinder, typically a split-image rangefinder: a range-finding focusing mechanism allowing the photographer to measure the subject distance and take photographs that are in sharp focus.

Most varieties of rangefinder show two images of the same subject, one of which moves when a calibrated wheel is turned; when the two images coincide and fuse into one, the distance can be read off the wheel. Older, non-coupled rangefinder cameras display the focusing distance and require the photographer to transfer the value to the lens focus ring; cameras without built-in rangefinders could have an external rangefinder fitted into the accessory shoe. Earlier cameras of this type had separate viewfinder and rangefinder windows; later the rangefinder was incorporated into the viewfinder. More modern designs have rangefinders coupled to the focusing mechanism so that the lens is focused correctly when the rangefinder images fuse; compare with the focusing screen in non-autofocus SLRs.

Almost all digital cameras, and most later film cameras, measure distance using electroacoustic or electronic means and focus automatically (autofocus); however, it is not customary to speak of this functionality as a rangefinder.

== History ==

The first rangefinders, sometimes called &quot;telemeters&quot;, appeared in the twentieth century; the first rangefinder camera to be marketed was the 3A Kodak Autographic Special of 1916; the rangefinder was coupled.
Not itself a rangefinder camera, the Leica I of 1925 had popularized the use of accessory rangefinders. The Leica II and Zeiss Contax I, both of 1932, were great successes as 35 mm rangefinder cameras, while on the Leica Standard, also introduced in 1932, the rangefinder was omitted. The Contax II (1936) integrated the rangefinder in the center of the viewfinder.
Rangefinder cameras were common from the 1930s to the 1970s, but the more advanced models lost ground to single-lens reflex (SLR) cameras.

Rangefinder cameras have been made in all sizes and all film formats over the years, from 35 mm through medium format (rollfilm) to large-format press cameras. Until the mid-1950s most were generally fitted to more expensive models of cameras. Folding bellows rollfilm cameras, such as the Balda Super Baldax or Mess Baldix, the Kodak Retina II, IIa, IIc, IIIc, and IIIC cameras and the Hans Porst Hapo 66e (a cheaper version of the Balda Mess Baldix), were often fitted with rangefinders.
The best-known rangefinder cameras take 35 mm film, use focal plane shutters, and have interchangeable lenses. These are Leica screwmount (also known as M39) cameras developed for lens manufacturer Ernst Leitz Wetzlar by Oskar Barnack (which gave rise to very many imitations and derivatives), Contax cameras manufactured for Carl Zeiss Optics by camera subsidiary Zeiss-Ikon and, after Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War II, produced again and then developed as the Soviet Kiev), Nikon S-series cameras from 1951 to 1962 (with design inspired by the Contax and function by the Leica), and Leica M-series cameras.

The Nikon rangefinder cameras were &quot;discovered&quot; in 1950 by &quot;Life&quot; magazine photographer David Douglas Duncan, who covered the Korean War. Canon manufactured several models from the 1930s until the 1960s; models from 1946 onwards were more or less compatible with the Leica thread mount. (From late 1951 they were completely compatible; the 7 and 7s had a bayonet mount for the 50 mm f/0.95 lens in addition to the thread mount for other lenses.)

Launched in 1940, The Kodak 35 Rangefinder was the first 35 mm camera made by the Eastman Kodak Company. Other such cameras include the Casca (Steinheil, West Germany, 1948), Detrola 400 (USA, 1940–41), Ektra (Kodak, USA, 1941–8), Foca (OPL, France, 1947–63), Foton (Bell &amp; Howell, USA, 1948), Opema II (Meopta, Czechoslovakia, 1955–60), Perfex (USA, 1938–49), Robot Royal (Robot-Berning, West Germany, 1955–76), and Witness (Ilford, Britain, 1953).

In the United States the dependable and cheap Argus (especially the ubiquitous C-3 &quot;Brick&quot;) was far and away the most popular 35 mm rangefinder, with millions sold.

Interchangeable-lens rangefinder cameras with focal-plane shutters are greatly outnumbered by fixed-lens leaf-shutter rangefinder cameras. The most popular design in the 1950s were folding designs like the Kodak Retina and the Zeiss Contessa.

In the 1960s many fixed-lens 35 mm rangefinder cameras for the amateur market were produced by several manufacturers, mainly Japanese, including Canon, Fujica, Konica, Mamiya, Minolta, Olympus, Petri Camera, Ricoh, and Yashica. Distributors such as Vivitar and Revue often sold rebranded versions of these cameras. While designed to be compact like the Leica, they were much less expensive. Many of them, such as the Minolta 7sII and the Vivitar 35ES, were fitted with high-speed, extremely high quality optics. Though eventually replaced in the market with newer compact autofocus cameras, many of these older rangefinders continue to operate, having outlived most of their newer (and less well-constructed) successors.

Starting with a camera made by the small Japanese company Yasuhara in the 1990s, there has been something of a revival of rangefinder cameras. Aside from the Leica M series, rangefinder models from this period include the Konica Hexar RF, Cosina, who makes the Voigtländer Bessa T/R/R2/R3/R4 (the last three are made in both manual or aperture automatic version, which use respectly the &quot;m&quot; or &quot;a&quot; sign in model), and the Hasselblad Xpan/Xpan 2. Zeiss had a new model called the Zeiss Ikon, also made by Cosina but now discontinued, while Nikon has also produced expensive limited editions of its S3 and SP rangefinders to satisfy the demands of collectors and aficionados. Cameras from the former Soviet Union—the Zorki and FED, based on the screwmount Leica, and the Kiev—are plentiful in the used market.

Medium-format rangefinder cameras continued to be produced until 2014. Recent models included the Mamiya 6 and 7I/7II, the Bronica RF645 and the Fuji G, GF, GS, GW and GSW series.

In 1994, Contax introduced an autofocus rangefinder camera, the Contax G.

== Digital rangefinder ==

=== Epson R-D1, Zenit M and PIXII ===

Digital imaging technology was applied to rangefinder cameras for the first time in 2004, with the introduction of the Epson R-D1, the first ever digital rangefinder camera. The RD-1 was a collaboration between Epson and Cosina. The R-D1 and later R-D1s use Leica M-mount lenses, or earlier Leica screw mount lenses with an adapter.

After the discontinuation of the R-D1, only Leica M digital rangefinders were in production until the introduction of two additional rangefinders in late 2018:
* the Pixii Camera (A1112) from France-based firm Pixii SAS; and
* the re-emergence of the Russian camera manufacturer Zenit with the limited release (500 units) Zenit M designed in Krasnogorsk and made in collaboration with Leica.
Both the Pixii and the Zenit M are true mechanical rangefinders, and they employ the Leica M mount, affording compatibility with current lens lines from Voigtlander, Zeiss, and Leica themselves.

=== Leica M ===
Leica released its first digital rangefinder camera, the Leica M8, in 2006. The M8 and R-D1 are expensive compared to more common digital SLRs, and lack several features that are common with modern digital cameras, such as autofocus, live preview, movie recording, and face detection. They have no real telephoto lenses available beyond 135 mm focal length and very limited macro ability.

Later, Leica released the Leica M (Typ 240) digital rangefinder, which adds live preview, video recording and focusing assistance, the Leica M Monochrom, which is similar to the Leica M9 but shoots solely in black and white, the Leica M Edition 60 which is similar to the M (Typ 240) but omits a rear display panel as a homage to film cameras, and the M10 and M11 without video recording.
== Pros and cons ==

=== Viewfinder parallax ===

The viewfinder of a rangefinder camera is offset from the picture-taking lens so that the image viewed is not exactly what will be recorded on the film; this parallax error is negligible at large subject distances but becomes significant as the distance decreases. For extreme close-up photography, the rangefinder camera is awkward to use, as the viewfinder no longer points at the subject.

More advanced rangefinder cameras project into the viewfinder a brightline frame that moves as the lens is focused, correcting parallax error down to the minimum distance at which the rangefinder functions. The angle of view of a given lens also changes with distance, and the brightline frames in the finders of a few cameras automatically adjust for this as well.

In contrast, the viewfinder pathway of an SLR transmits an image directly &quot;through the lens&quot;. This eliminates parallax errors at any subject distance, thus allowing for macro photography. It also removes the need to have separate viewfinders for different lens focal lengths. In particular, this allows for extreme telephoto lenses which would otherwise be very hard to focus and compose with a rangefinder. Furthermore, the through-the-lens view allows the viewfinder to directly display the depth of field for a given aperture, which is not possible with a rangefinder design. To compensate for this, rangefinder users often use zone focusing, which is especially applicable to the rapid-fire approach to street photography.

=== Large lenses block viewfinder ===
Larger lenses may block a portion of the view seen through the viewfinder, potentially a significant proportion. A side effect of this is that lens designers are forced to use smaller designs. Lens hoods used for rangefinder cameras may have a different shape to those with other cameras, with openings cut out of them to increase the visible area.

=== Difficulty integrating zoom lenses ===
The rangefinder design is not readily adapted for use with zoom lenses, which have a continuously variable field of view. The only true zoom lens for rangefinder cameras is the Contax G2 Carl Zeiss 35–70 mm Vario-Sonnar T* Lens with built-in zoom viewfinder. A very few lenses, such as the Konica M-Hexanon Dual or Leica Tri-Elmar, let the user select among two or three focal lengths; the viewfinder must be designed to work with all focal lengths of any lens used. The rangefinder may become misaligned, leading to incorrect focusing.

=== Historically unobtrusive ===
Rangefinder cameras are often quieter, particularly with leaf shutters, and smaller than competing SLR models. These qualities once made rangefinders more attractive for theater photography, some portrait photography, candid and street photography, and any application where an SLR is too large or obtrusive. However, today mirrorless digital cameras are capable of excellent low light performance, are much smaller and completely silent.

=== Absence of mirror ===
The absence of a mirror allows the rear element of lenses to project deep into the camera body, making high-quality wide-angle lenses easier to design. The Voigtländer 12 mm lens is the widest-angle rectilinear lens in general production, with a 121-degree angle of view; only recently have equivalent SLR lenses become available, though optically inferior. The absence of a mirror also means that rangefinder lenses have the potential to be significantly smaller than equivalent lenses for SLRs as they need not accommodate mirror swing. This ability to have high quality lenses and camera bodies in a compact form made Leica cameras and other rangefinders particularly appealing to photojournalists.

Since there is no moving mirror, as used in SLRs, there is no momentary blackout of the subject being photographed.

=== Field of view ===
Rangefinder viewfinders usually have a field of view slightly greater than the lens in use. This allows the photographer to be able to see what is going on outside of the frame, and therefore better anticipate the action, at the expense of a smaller image. In addition, with viewfinders with magnifications larger than 0.8x (e.g. some Leica cameras, the Epson RD-1/s, Canon 7, Nikon S, and in particular the Voigtländer Bessa R3A and R3M with their 1:1 magnification), photographers can keep both eyes open and effectively see a floating viewfinder frame superimposed on their real world view. This kind of two-eyed viewing is also possible with an SLR, using a lens focal length that results in a net viewfinder magnification close to 1.0 (usually a focal length slightly longer than a normal lens); use of a much different focal length would result in a viewfinder with a different magnification than the open eye, making fusion of the images impossible. There is also the difference of the eye-level since the eye looking in the viewfinder actually sees the frame from slightly below the other eye. This means that the final image perceived by the viewer will not be totally even, but rather leaning on one side. This issue can be avoided by shooting in vertical (i.e. portrait) orientation, shooting style and framing allowing.

=== Use of filters ===
If filters that absorb much light or change the colour of the image are used, it is difficult to compose, view, and focus on an SLR, but the image through a rangefinder viewfinder is unaffected. On the other hand, some filters, such as graduated filters and polarizers, are best used with SLRs as the effects they create need to be viewed directly.

<text>The Innu / Ilnu (&quot;man&quot;, &quot;person&quot;) or Innut / Innuat / Ilnuatsh (&quot;people&quot;), formerly called Montagnais from the French colonial period (French for &quot;mountain people&quot;, English pronunciation: ), are the Indigenous Canadians who inhabit the territory in the northeastern portion of the region of Labrador in the present-day province of Newfoundland and Labrador and some portions of Quebec. They refer to their traditional homeland as &quot;Nitassinan&quot; (&quot;Our Land&quot;, ᓂᑕᔅᓯᓇᓐ) or &quot;Innu-assi&quot; (&quot;Innu Land&quot;).

The ancestors of the modern First Nations were known to have lived on these lands as hunter-gatherers for many thousands of years. To support their seasonal hunting migrations, they created portable tents made of animal skins. Their subsistence activities were historically centred on hunting and trapping caribou, moose, deer, and small game.

Their language, which changed over time from Old Montagnais to Innu-aimun (popularly known since the French colonial era as &quot;Montagnais&quot;), is spoken throughout Nitassinan, with certain dialect differences. It is part of the Cree–Montagnais–Naskapi dialect continuum, and is unrelated to the Inuit languages of other nearby peoples.

The &quot;Innu / Ilnu&quot; consist of two regional tribal groups, with the Innus of Nutashkuan being the southernmost group and the Naskapi being the northernmost group. Both groups differ in dialect and partly also in their way of life and culture. These differences include:
* the &quot;Ilnu&quot;, &quot;Nehilaw&quot; or &quot;Western/Southern Montagnais&quot; in the south, speak the &quot;l&quot;-dialect (Ilnu-Aimun or Nenueun / Neːhlweːuːn), and 
* the &quot;Innu&quot; or &quot;Eastern Montagnais&quot; (&quot;Central / Moisie Montagnais&quot;, &quot;Eastern/Lower North Shore Montagnais&quot;, and &quot;Labrador / North West River Montagnais&quot;) live further north; they speak the &quot;n&quot;-dialect (Innu-Aimun)
Both groups are still called &quot;Montagnais&quot; in the official language of Crown–Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada. The Naskapi (&quot;people beyond the horizon&quot;, ᓇᔅᑲᐱ), who live further north, also identify as Innu or &quot;Iyiyiw&quot;.

Today, about 28,960 people of Innu origin live in various Indian settlements and reserves in Quebec and Labrador. To avoid confusion with the Inuit, who belong to the Eskimoan peoples, today only the singular form &quot;Innu / Ilnu&quot; is used for the Innu, members of the large Cree-language family. The plural form of &quot;Innut / Innuat / Ilnuatsh&quot; has been abandoned.

==Montagnais, Naskapi or Innu==
The people are frequently classified by the geography of their primary locations:
*the &quot;Neenoilno&quot;, live along the north shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, in Quebec; they have historically been referred to by Europeans as &quot;Montagnais&quot; (French for &quot;mountain people&quot;, English pronunciation: ), or &quot;Innu proper&quot; (&quot;Nehilaw&quot; and &quot;Ilniw&quot; – &quot;people&quot;)
*The &quot;Naskapi&quot; (also known as &quot;Innu&quot; and &quot;Iyiyiw&quot;), live farther north and are less numerous. The Innu recognize several distinctions among their people (e.g. Mushuau Innuat, Maskuanu, Uashau Innuat) based on different regional affiliations and speakers of various dialects of the Innu language.

The word &quot;Naskapi&quot; was first recorded by French colonists in the 17th century. They applied it to distant Innu groups who were beyond the reach of Catholic missionary influence. It was particularly applied to those people living in the lands that bordered Ungava Bay and the northern Labrador coast, near the Inuit communities of northern Quebec and northern Labrador. Gradually it came to refer to the people known today as the Naskapi First Nation.

The Naskapi are traditionally nomadic peoples, in contrast with the more sedentary &quot;Montagnais&quot;, who establish settled territories.

The &quot;Mushuau Innuat&quot; (plural), while related to the Naskapi, split off from the tribe in the 1900s. They were subject to a government relocation program at Davis Inlet. Some of the families of the Naskapi Nation of Kawawachikamach have close relatives in the Cree village of Whapmagoostui, on the eastern shore of Hudson Bay.

Since 1990, the Montagnais people have generally chosen to be officially referred to as the &quot;Innu&quot;, which means &quot;human being&quot; in &quot;Innu-aimun&quot;. The Naskapi have continued to use the word &quot;Naskapi&quot;.

==History==
The Innu were possibly the group identified in Greenlandic Norse by Norsemen as &quot;Skrælings&quot;. They referred to Nitassinan as &quot;Markland&quot;.

The Innu were historically allied with neighbouring Atikamekw, Wolastoqiyik (Maliseet) and Algonquin peoples against their enemies, the Algonquian-speaking Mi&#x27;kmaq and Iroquoian-speaking Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy (known as &quot;Haudenosaunee&quot;. During the Beaver Wars (1609–1701), the Iroquois repeatedly invaded the Innu territories from their homelands south of the Great Lakes. They took women and young males as captive slaves, and plundered their hunting grounds in search of more furs. Since these raids were made by the Iroquois with unprecedented brutality, the Innu themselves adopted the torment, torture, and cruelty of their enemies.

The Naskapi, on the other hand, usually had to confront the southward advancing Inuit in the east of the peninsula.

Innu oral tradition describes the original encounters of the Innu and the French explorers led by Samuel de Champlain as fraught with distrust. Neither group understood the language of the other, and the Innu were concerned about the motives of the French explorers.

The French asked permission to settle on the Innu&#x27;s coastal land, which the Innu called &quot;Uepishtikueiau&quot;. This eventually developed as Quebec City. According to oral tradition, the Innu at first declined their request. The French demonstrated their ability to farm wheat on the land and promised they would share their bounty with the Innu in the future, which the Innu accepted.

Two distinct versions of the oral history describe the outcome. In the first, the French used gifts of farmed food and manufactured goods to encourage the Innu to become dependent on them. Then, the French changed it to a mercantile relationship: trading these items to the Innu in exchange for furs. When the nomadic Innu went inland for the winter, the French increased the size and population of their settlement considerably, eventually completely displacing the Innu.

The second, and more widespread, version of the oral history describes a more immediate conflict. In this version, the Innu taught the French how to survive in their traditional lands. Once the French had learned enough to survive on their own, they began to resent the Innu. The French began to attack the Innu, who retaliated in an attempt to reclaim their ancestral territory. The Innu had a disadvantage in numbers and weaponry, and eventually began to avoid the area rather than risk further defeat. During this conflict, the French colonists took many Innu women as wives. French women did not immigrate to New France in the early period.

French explorer Samuel de Champlain eventually became involved in the Innu&#x27;s conflict with the Iroquois, who were ranging north from their traditional territory around the Great Lakes in present-day New York and Pennsylvania. On July 29, 1609, at Ticonderoga or Crown Point, New York, (historians are not sure which of these two places), Champlain and his party encountered a group of Iroquois, likely Mohawk, who were the easternmost tribe of the Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy. A battle began the next day. As two hundred Iroquois advanced on Champlain&#x27;s position, a native guide pointed out the three enemy chiefs to the French. According to legend, Champlain fired his arquebus and killed two of the Mohawk chiefs with one shot; one of his men shot and killed the third. The Mohawk reportedly fled the scene. Although the French also traded extensively with the Mohawk and other Iroquois, and converted some to Catholicism, they also continued to have armed conflicts with them.

== Historical bands ==
The southern bands of the Montagnais-Naksapi were encountered by Europeans early in the seventeenth century while the northern ones, except for some on James Bay, were not well known until the nineteenth century.

The following are bands of the Montagnais-Naksapi in the 17th century:

* Bersimis, around the Bersimis River
* Chicoutimi, north of Chicoutimi
* Chisedec, around Seven Islands and around the Moise River
* Escoumains, around the Escoumains River
* Godbout, around the Godbout River
* Mistassini, around Lake Mistassini
* Nichikun, around Nichikun Lake
* Ouchestigouetch, at the heads of Manikuagan and Kaniapiskau Rivers.
* Oumamiwek (or Ste. Marguerite), west of the Ste. Marguerite River
* Papinachois, at the head of the Bersimis River and east of it
* Tadousac, west of the lower Saguenay River
By 1850, the Chisedec, Oumamiwek, and Papinachois had disappeared or been renamed, and many new bands in the north of Nitassinan were discovered:

* Barren Ground, on the middle course of the George River
* Big River, around the Great Whale and Fort George Rivers
* Davis Inlet, south of the Barren Ground band
* Eastmain, north of the Eastmain River.
* Kaniapiskau, at the head of the Kaniapiskau River
* Michikamau, around Michikamau Lake
* Mingan, on the Mingan River
* Musquaro (or Romaine), on the Olomanoshibo River
* Natashkwan, on the Natashkwan River
* Northwest River, north of Hamilton Inlet and on the Northwest River
* Petisikapau, in the country around Petisikapau Lake
* Rupert House, around Rupert Bay and the Rupert River
* St. Augustin, on the St. Augustin River
* Shelter Bay, around modern-day Shelter Bay
* Ungava, southwest of the Ungava Bay
* Waswanipi, on the Waswanipi River
* White Whale River, between Lake Minto and Little Whale River and eastward to the Kaniapiskau River

== Present status ==
The Innu of Labrador and those living on the north shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence in the Canadian Shield region have never officially ceded their territory to Canada by way of treaty or other agreement. But, as European-Canadians began widespread forest and mining operations at the turn of the 20th century, the Innu became increasingly settled in coastal communities and in the interior of Quebec. The Canadian and provincial governments, the Catholic, Moravian, and Anglican churches, all encouraged the Innu to settle in more permanent, majority-style communities, in the belief that their lives would improve with this adaptation. This coercive assimilation resulted in the Innue giving up some traditional activities (hunting, trapping, fishing). Because of these social disruptions and the systemic disadvantages faced by Indigenous peoples, community life in the permanent settlements often became associated with high levels of substance abuse, domestic violence, and suicide among the Innu.

=== Labrador Innu organizations and land claims ===
In 1999, Survival International published a study of the Innu communities of Labrador. It assessed the adverse effects of the Canadian government&#x27;s relocating the people far from their ancestral lands and preventing them from practising their ancient way of life.

The Innu people of Labrador formally organized the Naskapi Montagnais Innu Association in 1976 to protect their rights, lands, and way of life against industrialization and other outside forces. The organization changed its name to the Innu Nation in 1990 and functions today as the governing body of the Labrador Innu. The group has won recognition for its members as status Indians under Canada&#x27;s &quot;Indian Act&quot; in 2002 and is currently involved in land claim and self-governance negotiations with the federal and provincial governments.

In addition to the Innu Nation, residents at both Natuashish and Sheshatshiu elect Band Councils to represent community concerns. The chiefs of both councils sit on the Innu Nation&#x27;s board of directors and the three groups work in cooperation with one another.

The Innu Nation&#x27;s efforts to raise awareness about the environmental impacts of a mining project in Voisey&#x27;s Bay were documented in Marjorie Beaucage&#x27;s 1997 film &quot;Ntapueu ... i am telling the truth.&quot;

===Davis Inlet, Labrador===
In the 1999 study of Innu communities in Labrador, Survival International concluded that government policies violated contemporary international law in human rights, and drew parallels with the treatment of Tibetans by the People&#x27;s Republic of China. According to the study, from 1990 to 1997, the Innu community of Davis Inlet had a suicide rate more than twelve times the Canadian average, and well over three times the rate often observed in isolated northern villages. 

By 2000, the Innu island community of Davis Inlet asked the Canadian government to assist with a local addiction public health crisis. At their request, the community was relocated to a nearby mainland site, now known as &quot;Natuashish&quot;. At the same time, the Canadian government created the Natuashish and Sheshatshiu band councils under the &quot;Indian Act&quot;.

===Kawawachikamach, Quebec===

Naskapi Nation of Kawawachikamach, Quebec, signed a comprehensive land claims settlement, the &quot;Northeastern Quebec Agreement&quot;; they did so in 1978. As a consequence, the Naskapi of Kawawachikamach are no longer subject to certain provisions of the &quot;Indian Act&quot;. All the Innu communities of Quebec are still subject to the Act.

===New York Power Authority controversy===
The New York Power Authority&#x27;s proposed contract in 2009 with the province of Quebec to buy power from its extensive hydroelectric dam facilities has generated controversy, because it was dependent on construction of a new dam complex and transmission lines that would have interfered with the traditional ways of the Innu. According to the Sierra Club:

The Innu community, the Sierra Club, and the National Lawyers Guild are fighting to prevent this proposed contract, which would have to be approved by New York&#x27;s Governor, under his regulatory authority. The problem is that construction of required electric transmission lines would hinder the Innu&#x27;s hunting-gathering-fishing lifestyle:

Chief Grégoire&#x27;s comments at a press conference in Albany, New York were translated, but whether from French or Innu-aimun is not clear.

=== Natuashish and Sheshatshiu, Newfoundland and Labrador ===

Innu have only been in Sheshatshiu since fur trading posts were established by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in North West River in the mid-1700s and only in Davis Inlet / Natuashish since 1771, when the Moravian Church set up the first mission at Nuneingoak on the Labrador coast. Danny Williams, the then Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador struck a deal on September 26, 2008, with Labrador&#x27;s Innu to permit construction of Muskrat Falls Generating Station, a hydroelectric megaproject to proceed on the proposed Lower Churchill site. They also negotiated compensation for another project on the Upper Churchill, where large tracts of traditional Innu hunting lands were flooded.

==Culture==


===Ethnobotany===
The Innu people grate the inner bark of &quot;Abies balsamea&quot; (balsam fir) and eat it to benefit the diet.

===Traditional crafts===
Traditional Innu craft is demonstrated in the Innu tea doll. These children&#x27;s toys originally served a dual purpose for nomadic Innu tribes. When travelling vast distances over challenging terrain, the people left nothing behind. They believed that &quot;Crow&quot; would take it away. Everyone, including young children, helped to transport essential goods. Innu women made intricate dolls from caribou hides and scraps of cloth. They filled the dolls with tea and gave them to young girls to carry on long journeys. The girls could play with the dolls while also carrying important goods. Every able-bodied person carried something. Men generally carried the heavier bags and women would carry young children.

===Traditional clothing, style and accessories===
Men wore caribou pants and boots with a buckskin long shirt, all made by women. With the introduction of trade cloth from the French and English, people began replacing the buckskin shirts with ones made of cloth. Most still wore boots and pants made from caribou hide. Women wore long dresses of buckskin. Contemporary Innu women have often replaced these with manufactured pants and jackets. Women traditionally wore their hair long or in two coils. Men wore theirs long.

Both genders wore necklaces made of bone and bead. Smoke pipes were used by both genders, marked for women as shorter. If a man killed a bear, it was a sign of joy and initiation into adulthood and the man would wear a necklace made from the bear&#x27;s claws.

===Housing===
The houses of the Montagnais were cone shaped. The Naskapi made long, domed houses covered in caribou hides. These days the hearth is a metal stove in the centre of the house.

===Traditional foods===
Animals traditionally eaten included moose, caribou, porcupine, rabbits, marten, woodchuck, squirrel; Canada goose, snow goose, brants, ducks, teal, loons, spruce grouse, woodcock, snipe, passenger pigeons, ptarmigan; whitefish, lake trout, salmon, Arctic char, seal (&quot;naskapi&quot;) pike, walleye, suckerfish (&quot;Catostomidae&quot;), sturgeon, catfish, lamprey, and smelt. Fish were eaten roasted or smoke-dried. Moose meat and several types of fish were also smoked. Oat bannock, introduced by the French in the 16th century, became a staple and Indigenous bannock is still eaten today. Meat was eaten frozen, raw or roasted, and caribou was sometimes boiled in a stew. Pemmican was made with moose or caribou.

Plants traditionally eaten included raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, cherries, wild grapes, hazelnuts, crab apples, red martagon bulbs, Indian potato, and maple-tree sap for sweetening. Cornmeal was traded with other First Nations peoples, such as the Iroquois, Algonquin, and Abenaki, and made into apon (cornbread), which sometimes also included oat or wheat flour when it became available. Pine needle tea was meant to keep away infections and colds resulting from the harsh weather.

===Buckskin===
Traditionally, buckskin leather was a most important material used for clothing, boots, moccasins, house covers and storage. Women prepared the hides and many of the products made from it. They scraped the hides to remove all fur, then left them outside to freeze. The next step was to stretch the hide on a frame. They rubbed it with a mixture of animal brain and pine needle tea to soften it. The dampened hide was formed into a ball and left overnight. In the morning, it would be stretched again, then placed over a smoker to smoke and tan it. The hide was left overnight. The finished hide was called buckskin.

===Mythology===

The oral traditions of the Innu are noted as similar to those of other Cree-speaking cultures. Of particular relevance is Tshakapesh, a lunar folk hero.

The spirits they believed in are Caribou Master, Atshen, and Matshishkapeu.

===Film and television===
The Innu people were profiled in &quot;Carcajou et le péril blanc (Kauapishit Miam Kuakuatshen Etentakuess)&quot;, a documentary film series by Arthur Lamothe which were among the first films in the history of cinema to depict indigenous peoples speaking their own languages.

Other important later films set in Innu communities have included the narrative feature films &quot;Le Dep&quot;, &quot;Mesnak&quot; and &quot;Kuessipan&quot;, and the documentary films &quot;Innu Nikamu: Resist and Sing&quot; and &quot;Call Me Human&quot;.

==Transportation==

In traditional Innu communities, people walked or used snowshoes. While people still walk and use snowshoes where necessary for hunting or trapping, many Innu communities rely heavily on trucks, SUVs, and cars; in northern Innu communities, people use snowmobiles for hunting and general transportation.

<text>Yoshi is a fictional dinosaur who appears in video games published by Nintendo. Yoshi debuted in &quot;Super Mario World&quot; (1990) on the SNES as Mario and Luigi&#x27;s sidekick. Throughout the mainline &quot;Super Mario&quot; series, Yoshi typically serves as Mario&#x27;s trusted steed. With a gluttonous appetite, Yoshi can gobble enemies with his long tongue, and lay eggs that doubly function as projectiles. Yoshi is the title character of the &quot;Yoshi&quot; series and a supporting character in the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise. He has appeared in &quot;Mario Party&quot; and &quot;Mario Kart&quot;, as well as many &quot;Mario&quot; sports games. He also appears as a playable character in the crossover fighting game series &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; Yoshi is a member of the same-named species, which is distinguished for its wide range of colors.

Yoshi has been well-received, with some critics noting that he is one of the most recognizable characters and one of the best sidekicks in video games. Yoshi&#x27;s image has also appeared on a range of products, including clothes and collectibles.

== Concept and creation ==
Shigeru Miyamoto, the video game designer at Nintendo credited with inventing the &quot;Mario&quot; series, had wanted Mario to have a dinosaur companion ever since the first release of &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;; however, Nintendo engineers could not add such a character into the game due to the limitations of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The inspiration for Yoshi can be traced back further, to the green dragon Tamagon in the 1984 video game &quot;Devil World:&quot; also designed by Miyamoto, both are green lizards that hatch from eggs and can eat enemies with their large mouth, and also emit the same noise when they hatch. During the development of &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot;, Miyamoto had a number of sketches around his desk, including an image of Mario riding a horse. Takashi Tezuka, a &quot;Mario&quot; series developer, speculated that Miyamoto&#x27;s love of horse riding as well as country and western themes influenced Yoshi&#x27;s creation. The concept of Mario riding a dinosaur also came from the NES video game &quot;Excitebike&quot;, which featured people riding motorcycles.

Once the more powerful Super NES was released, Miyamoto was finally able to implement Yoshi into the series, putting Yoshi into the video game &quot;Super Mario World&quot;. As development of &quot;Super Mario World&quot; progressed, the team opted to set the game in a &quot;dinosaur land&quot;, so Tezuka asked designer Shigefumi Hino to draw a reptile-like creature based on Miyamoto&#x27;s sketches. Hino originally produced a design that Tezuka deemed too reptilian, and &quot;didn&#x27;t really fit into the Mario world&quot;, so he encouraged the designer to create a &quot;cuter&quot; character. According to Hino, Yoshi&#x27;s tongue attack was originally conceived as Yoshi sticking out his tongue in surprise when Mario hit the back of his head. This was later &quot;passed off&quot; as Mario merely pointing forward to signal Yoshi to stick out his tongue. Alongside the individual Yoshi, &quot;Super Mario World&quot; also introduced other members of the Yoshi species, characterized by their variety of colors.

Yoshi proved to be popular in this debut, which caused the next game in the series, &quot;Super Mario World 2: Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot;, to focus on the Yoshi species. At Miyamoto&#x27;s prompting, Hino landed on the idea of using Yoshi as the main character of a platforming game, with the goal of being more accessible than previous games in the &quot;Mario&quot; series. To give the gameplay a more &quot;gentle and relaxed pacing&quot;, the levels lack time limits and feature more exploration elements than previous games; Yoshi&#x27;s flutter jump also makes him easier to control in the air than Mario. In this game, he is responsible for Baby Mario, which leads him to Bowser&#x27;s Castle, where he is reunited with Baby Luigi. Yoshi successfully pulls the twins together just in time to go home after beating a huge Baby Bowser.

The version of Yoshi seen in the live-action &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; film was realized using a animatronic dinosaur. Yoshi was designed in the film by Dave Nelson. The animatronic had nearly 60 meters (200 ft) of cable and hundreds of moving parts inside of it and was controlled by nine puppeteers. The body was cable-controlled, while the head was radio-controlled. Nelson described the overall process as being &quot;difficult.&quot; The creation of Yoshi was handled by a company independent from the filmmakers.

== Appearances ==
===In &quot;Super Mario&quot; series===

&quot;Super Mario World&quot; was the first video game to feature Yoshi as a companion to Mario. Yoshi&#x27;s rideability was inspired by Miyamoto&#x27;s love for horseback riding. &quot;Super Mario World&quot; released during a console war between Nintendo and Sega; Sega&#x27;s mascot, Sonic the Hedgehog, was considered a &quot;cooler&quot; alternative to Mario, for which Miyamoto apologized.

In &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, Yoshi makes a minor cameo. A cannon outside the castle becomes available if Mario collects all 120 Power Stars, which can be used to access the Mushroom Castle&#x27;s roof. There, the player can chat with Yoshi, who congratulates the player on finishing the game by delivering a message from the developers before rewarding Mario with 100 extra lives and a better Triple Jump.

Yoshi is one of the primary protagonists and the first playable character in &quot;Super Mario 64 DS&quot;, alongside Mario. Princess Peach initially invites Mario to her palace. Yoshi is sleeping on the roof when Mario, Luigi, and Wario arrive at the castle. During this time, Bowser kidnaps Princess Peach, steals the castle&#x27;s Power Stars, and confines everyone within by placing them in the worlds inside the castle&#x27;s paintings. The crew reclaims the castle&#x27;s Power Stars after Yoshi saves Mario, Mario saves Luigi, and Luigi saves Wario, and Mario defeats Bowser and rescues Princess Peach.

In &quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot;, Yoshi appears as a mount for Mario, and will only come out of his egg if offered a specific tropical fruit. This fruit gives him the ability to spit a finite stream of juice, though with the tradeoff that he dies as soon as he touches water.

Yoshi makes another cameo in &quot;New Super Mario Bros. Wii&quot; and &quot;New Super Mario Bros. U&quot;, this time as a rideable character, as he did in his initial appearance. Yoshi sounds just like he does in &quot;Super Mario World&quot;. Yoshis in the colors yellow, light blue, and pink also appear in multiplayer.

Yoshi&#x27;s appearance is a prominent selling point for &quot;Super Mario Galaxy 2&quot;, as his gained abilities while eating various fruits aid Mario and Luigi in gathering power stars to foil Bowser&#x27;s plan to take over the universe. These fruits give him the ability to float, to run on water and against gravity, and to illuminate intangible walkways.

Yoshi appears in &quot;Super Mario Odyssey&quot; as a capturable character. In the Mushroom Kingdom, he may be found on top of Peach&#x27;s Castle, just like in &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;. He can also be discovered in Yoshi Eggs in secret locations accessed via the Dark Side, where he must eat Berries in order for a Power Moon to form. He can also be found in one of the Darker Side&#x27;s sections. Yoshi may employ his characteristic Flutter Jump and eating powers if captured, similar to his appearance in &quot;Super Mario Galaxy 2&quot;.

Yoshi appears in &quot;Super Mario Bros. Wonder&quot; as a playable character for the first time since &quot;Super Mario 64 DS&quot;, with red, yellow, and blue variants. He brings his signature Flutter Jump to the game, along with other abilities like the ability to be ridden by other players.

===In &quot;Yoshi&quot; series===

Yoshi&#x27;s initial appearance in the &quot;Yoshi&quot; series was in the puzzle game named after him, where he counted the number of eggs hatched on the side of the screen. In another puzzle game, &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Cookie&quot;, Yoshi appears as a character in V.S. mode. Yoshi has to make horizontal and vertical rows of the same kind of cookie to proceed to the next level. In the Nintendo Puzzle Collection version, there is now a story mode in the game, where Mario and Yoshi are making cookies but get exhausted from the many cookie deliveries.

Bowser conquers Jewelry Land during the events of &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Safari&quot; (It is the only &quot;Mario&quot; franchise game to feature first-person shooter gameplay and requires the SNES&#x27;s Super Scope light gun.), kidnapping its rulers, King Fret and Prince Pine, and removing the twelve mystical jewels that gave the kingdom its name and stability, forcing it to split into two realms: the Dark Realm and the Light Realm. Princess Peach then summons Mario and Yoshi to restore order. To help the two, Peach provides Mario a new weapon, the Super Scope, an energy pistol. Mario and Yoshi enter a Warp Pipe with this new weapon, which transports them to Jewelry Land.

The Magikoopa sorcerer Kamek foresees that two newborn brothers will bring ruin to the Koopas and attempts to capture them as the stork carries them to their mother and father in the Mushroom Kingdom one morning years before the events of most Mario games, during the events of &quot;Super Mario World 2: Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot;. While Kamek captures Baby Luigi, his twin brother, Baby Mario, escapes to Yoshi&#x27;s Island unseen. Fortunately, Yoshi is out walking in the woods that day, and Baby Mario lands unharmed on his saddle, along with a map to Bowser&#x27;s Castle, where Kamek has stolen Baby Luigi.

Baby Mario was entirely absent in the next &quot;Yoshi&quot; game, &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Story&quot;, in which Baby Bowser steals a tree that is the source of the Yoshis&#x27; happiness, and turns their world into a picture book. Six eggs survive, and hatch into baby Yoshis, the protagonists.

Kamek and Bowser travel back in time in &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island DS&quot; to try to capture the famous star children (Mario, Luigi, Wario, and Donkey Kong), who had special energy in their bodies that, once in Bowser&#x27;s hands, would let him to take over the world. Without knowing who the star children were, Kamek and Bowser went out to kidnap all of the Mushroom Kingdom&#x27;s youngsters, only to have their prey escape their hands and join Yoshi in a journey to save the other kids.

In &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s New Island&quot;, Yoshi reappears alongside Baby Mario and Baby Luigi. The game takes place between &quot;Super Mario World 2: Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; and &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island DS&quot;.

In &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Woolly World&quot;, Kamek tries to transform all of the Yoshis on Craft Island into Wonder Wools in order to assist Baby Bowser in building a new castle, but he misses Yoshi and Red Yoshi. After that, the two embarked on a quest to restore Craft Island to its former splendor.

Yoshi and the rest of his kind are gathered around the Sundream Stone in &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Crafted World&quot;, which is claimed to make anyone&#x27;s dream come true. Kamek and Baby Bowser try to get their hands on the stone. The Sundream Stone breaks into five diamonds, which spread around the island for the Yoshis to collect.

=== Other &quot;Super Mario&quot; games ===
Yoshi has appeared in nearly all of the &quot;Mario&quot; spin-off games, including every game in the &quot;Mario Kart&quot; series as a playable character (usually as a middleweight or light middleweight) and every &quot;Mario Party&quot; game to date as a playable character. Yoshis have also made appearances in multiple &quot;Mario&quot; sports games, such as &quot;Mario Tennis&quot;, &quot;Mario Golf&quot;, &quot;Mario Super Sluggers&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Strikers&quot;, and &quot;Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games&quot;.

Yoshi appeared as a supporting cast member in &quot;Mario is Missing&quot; for NES, SNES, and MS-DOS in 1993.

The Yoshi species makes its &quot;Paper Mario&quot; series debut in the fifth chapter of &quot;Paper Mario&quot; when Mario comes across a village of Yoshis and rescues a group of Yoshi kids after they become lost in the surrounding jungle outside of the village. In the sequel &quot;Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door&quot; Mario rescues a Yoshi egg that hatches into a baby Yoshi, who then joins his team during the third chapter of the game and can be named upon doing so. He also appears in &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi: Partners in Time&quot;.

Yoshi is a playable character in &quot;Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle&quot;, and he arrives late in the story. After fighting Mecha Jr. in the Lava Pit, he is unlocked.

=== In other media ===
Outside of &quot;Super Mario&quot; and &quot;Yoshi&quot; series. Yoshi makes a cameo appearance in &quot;Metal Gear&quot; (&quot;The Twin Snakes&quot; and &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater 3D&quot;). In &quot;Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes&quot;, Yoshi and Mario appears as a dolls that stand on a desk. Additional video game series in which Yoshi has made a cameo appearance includes &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series (&quot;Link&#x27;s Awakening&quot; and &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;) as a collectible doll and as a framed photo in Hyrule Castle.

Yoshi is the main character in the English localization of &quot;Tetris Attack&quot;. Yoshi also appears as a playable character in every installment of the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series. He is one of the more unique characters in the series&#x27; early history, most notably in how his recovery is a single interruption-resistant Flutter Jump, as opposed to most characters having multiple jumps and special moves to use in sequence. Yoshi&#x27;s moveset mostly consists of kicks, headbutts, tail attacks, and tongue grabs.

The animated series &quot;Super Mario World&quot; produced by DIC Entertainment is based on the game of the same name, and similar in plotline to the previous series &quot;The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3&quot;, and &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Super Show&quot;, except with a different setting. The show features Yoshi as a regular character, voiced by Andrew Sabiston. In the cartoon, Yoshi is a young, friendly, and fleet-of-foot dinosaur who occasionally talks in 3rd person until speaking coherent English from slightly later in the episode &quot;A Little Learning&quot;.

Yoshi is featured in the &quot;Super Mario Adventures&quot; comic serial printed in Nintendo Power, the &quot;Nintendo Adventure Books&quot;, and the 1993 &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; movie (taking the form of a realistic animatronic dinosaur). Yoshi is King Koopa&#x27;s pet, and is referred to as a &quot;throwback&quot; by a gang of Koopas. He later joins Princess Daisy&#x27;s side and selflessly takes a stabbing for her. However, he does reappear at the end of the film in good health. Yoshi first debuts in the first volume of &quot;Super Mario-Kun&quot; and has since become a frequent companion to Mario. Yoshi is prone to making surprising behaviors and mistakes, prompting Mario to chastise him. Yoshi abandons Mario, Luigi, and Wario in volume 23 when they take advantage of him. Additionally, Yoshi makes an off-screen vocal cameo in &quot;The Super Mario Bros Movie&quot; during the post-credits scene, with archival audio of Kazumi Totaka being utilized.

Yoshi is also prominently featured within Universal Destinations &amp; Experiences&#x27; immersive Super Nintendo World areas. Yoshi appears within the Mario Kart: Bowser&#x27;s Challenge attraction, and the Universal Studios Japan iteration of the land features a Yoshi&#x27;s Adventure attraction that is themed to the Yoshi&#x27;s Island series.

== Promotion and reception ==
Yoshi is one of the most recognizable characters in the &quot;Mario&quot; series and is featured in a myriad of &quot;Mario&quot; merchandise, such as toys, shirts, and figures. Yoshi also appeared in two of Happy Meal promotions of &quot;Mario&quot; toys, which only featured Mario, Donkey Kong, and Yoshi. Yoshi was also one of the 12 initial amiibo figurines. As part of the release of &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Woolly World&quot;, Yoshi Amiibo made out of yarn are either bundled with the game or sold separately. In addition to the regular-sized green, pink and light blue yarn Yoshi Amiibo, an 8-inch tall, green &quot;Mega Yarn Yoshi&quot; has been released.

Since debuting in &quot;Super Mario World&quot;, Yoshi has received largely positive reception. An article in &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; commented, &quot;Maybe it was the undeniable dino charm. Maybe it was the insatiable appetite that put fellow foe-eater Kirby to shame. Or maybe it was the status of being Mario&#x27;s newest best buddy. Whatever the reason, gamers took an immediate liking to Yoshi and his multicolored kin when &quot;Super Mario World&quot; hatched him into the pantheon of classic game characters.&quot; The 2011 issue of the &quot;Guinness World Records Gamer&#x27;s Edition&quot; ranked Yoshi at 21st place in their list of the &quot;Top 50 Video Game Characters of All Time&quot;, making him the second highest-ranked &quot;Mario&quot; character on the list, of which Mario himself is ranked first. In a poll conducted in 2008, Yoshi was voted as the third-favorite video game character in Japan, with Cloud Strife and Mario placing second and first, respectively. &quot;GameTrailers&quot; created a special tribute video for Yoshi for the release of &quot;Super Mario Galaxy 2&quot;. &quot;Yardbarker&quot; included Yoshi in their &quot;The most memorable characters from old school Nintendo games&quot;, stating that &quot;Yoshi began life in &quot;Super Mario World&quot;. However, the dinosaur with the lengthy tongue was swiftly spun off into his own video games. There&#x27;s &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot;, &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Cookie&quot;, and more. Yoshi is off doing his own thing a lot of the time.&quot; Chris Carter of &quot;Destructoid&quot; described Yoshi, along with Poochy, as &quot;cute as hell&quot; in the &quot;Poochy &amp; Yoshi&#x27;s Woolly World&quot; promotion. Yoshi was voted one of the finest dinosaurs of pop culture by Jim Vorel of &quot;Paste&quot;, who stated that &quot;Yoshi has been a fan favorite since he first appeared alongside Mario on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. That&#x27;s why he&#x27;s the most famous dinosaur in the world.&quot;

Yoshi was also praised for being the best video game sidekick. &quot;GameSpy&quot; ranked Yoshi as the seventh-best video game sidekick, above Luigi by reasoning that only Yoshi can pull off being green and still be cool. &quot;Complex&quot; ranked Yoshi at fourth place among &quot;The 25 Most Kickass Dragons in Video Games&quot;, adding &quot;Yoshi would have to be one of the best sidekicks of all time&quot;. Australia&#x27;s &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; called Yoshi a &quot;cute, trustworthy, a plumber&#x27;s best friend&quot; and compared Yoshi&#x27;s loyalty to that of a dog. Yoshi is ranked at 52nd place on &quot;GamesRadar&quot;″s Top 100 video game heroes. 4,228 gamers from all over the world were asked to choose their favorite &quot;most loved sidekick characters in video games.&quot; Yoshi from &quot;Super Mario World&quot; came in top place and was voted the most popular sidekick character with 71 percent of the voting. Yoshi was included in &quot;IGN&quot;″s &quot;The Best Video Game Wingmen Ever&quot;, stating that &quot;Always ready to give his plumber friend a ride, Yoshi doesn&#x27;t shy away from putting in extra effort, whether that means holding a Koopa shell in his mouth for an entire level or kicking his feet to get a little extra air during a jump, Yoshi has Mario&#x27;s back.&quot; Yoshi has been named one of the best-supporting characters in video games by Kevin Wong of &quot;Complex&quot;, stating that &quot;Yoshi has everything Mario and Luigi need in a sidekick – a monstrous appetite, boots that can walk on Munchers, and the ability to breathe fire, fly, and cause earthquakes, depending on the Koopa shell&#x27;s color. You have to love a sidekick that hatches with a built-in saddle.&quot; Alyssa Mercante of &quot;GamesRadar&quot; also included Yoshi in their list of &quot;The ten best video game animal companions,&quot; statintg that &quot;Yoshi is another companion that has achieved a level of fame virtually unrivaled by video game sidekicks.&quot; &quot;Yoshi Committed Tax Fraud&quot;, an internet meme that began in May 2018, is a reference to jokes about Yoshi dodging taxes.

<doc id="81435" wikidata="Q507001" url="?curid=81435" title="Princess Peach">
<text>is a character in Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Mario&quot; franchise. She was created by Shigeru Miyamoto and introduced in the 1985 original &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; game as Princess Toadstool. She is the princess regnant and head of state of the Mushroom Kingdom, where she resides in her castle along with Toads. Since her debut, she has appeared in the majority of &quot;Mario&quot; video games as the main female character and the romantic interest of Mario. She has been voiced by Samantha Kelly since 2007.

As the lead female character in the &quot;Super Mario&quot; series, Peach&#x27;s role is typically the damsel in distress who is kidnapped by the main series antagonist, Bowser. In most of the games, her role is to be a captive until she is eventually rescued by Mario. In several multiplayer games of the series, she is a playable character, such as &quot;Super Mario 3D World&quot; and &quot;Super Mario Bros. Wonder&quot;. Outside the series, she has appeared as the protagonist and player character of several video games, including &quot;Princess Toadstool&#x27;s Castle Run&quot;, &quot;Super Princess Peach,&quot; and &quot;Princess Peach: Showtime!&quot;. She makes regular appearances as a playable character in &quot;Mario&quot; spin-offs and other video game series, including &quot;Mario Sports&quot; games, &quot;Mario Kart&quot;, &quot;Mario Party&quot;, &quot;Paper Mario&quot; and the fighting game series &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot;.

Peach is one of the best-known female protagonists in video game history, having appeared in more video game titles than any other female character. She has also appeared in official merchandise, comics, and animated series. In &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot; (2023), she is voiced by Anya Taylor-Joy. Peach has received a mixed reception, with much commentary being critical of her longstanding repetitive role as a princess waiting to be rescued. She has been described by critics as one of the most iconic and influential female video game characters.

== Concept and creation ==
=== Characterization ===
Princess Peach was preceded as Mario&#x27;s romantic interest by a character named Pauline (originally named Lady) that appeared as the damsel in distress in Mario&#x27;s first video game, &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, in 1981. Mario&#x27;s creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, wanted to use the characters Popeye, Bluto, and Olive Oyl from the &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoon as the main characters, but failed to obtain the license, so he transformed them into Jumpman (Mario), Donkey Kong, and Pauline. &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; established Pauline&#x27;s role as the female character who is rescued by Mario and appears as the damsel in distress in subsequent games. With the arrival of the Nintendo Entertainment System and &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, Pauline was replaced by Princess Peach. Miyamoto later said that &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; had been designed for arcades, which were frequented by male gamers, so Nintendo did not consider making a character that would be playable by girls. Several characteristics of Princess Peach were introduced in the 1996 role-playing game &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot;, including her use of a parasol as a weapon and a sleep spell ability that inspired her Final Smash in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series.

Following the debut of Waluigi in &quot;Mario Tennis&quot;, an evil version of Peach named &quot;Walupeach&quot; was pitched by Shugo Takahashi, co-founder of Camelot Software Planning, but the concept was rejected by Miyamoto before seeing the design, saying that it would be &quot;just like Doronjo&quot; from the &quot;Yatterman&quot; anime series. The design was pitched again by Waluigi&#x27;s creator, Fumihide Aoki, for the 2004 video game &quot;Mario Power Tennis&quot;, but was rejected by Nintendo.

Reflecting on Peach&#x27;s role within the franchise, Miyamoto said that although Nintendo had intentionally kept her as a damsel in distress who is saved by Mario in the games, they had wanted to develop her into a more powerful princess in &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot;. He said that Peach was one of the characters in the film that evolved the most, as her role was changed from a princess that needs to be protected to one who fights for Toad. After the release of the film in 2023, Peach&#x27;s appearance was updated on the box art for &quot;Princess Peach: Showtime!&quot; to make her appear more angry and determined like her movie counterpart.

=== Design ===

Peach&#x27;s initial appearance was drawn by Miyamoto, who later asked Yōichi Kotabe to redraw Peach with his instructions. He had asked Kotabe to draw her eyes to be &quot;a little cat-like&quot; and wanted her to look &quot;stubborn, but a little cute&quot;. A strategy guide titled &quot;How to Win at Super Mario Bros.&quot;, which was published around the time of the first &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; game in 1985, depicted the princess as a human on its cover, but also with an alternative design featuring a mushroom head. Other merchandise designs created around the time of the first game depicted Peach with straight, long blonde hair wearing a red skirt, illustrating that her design was not finalized until later games.

When discussing Peach&#x27;s design for &quot;Super Princess Peach&quot;, released in 2005, Miyamoto said that it was important for Peach to be &quot;Peach-like&quot;, meaning that she evokes the &quot;free optimism of a princess&quot;. He explained that she was designed to convey an image of strength, rather than being protected by Mario, due to many Nintendo developers being used to a matriarchal figure at home.

=== Names ===
Miyamoto said that Peach&#x27;s name came from associating princesses with girls, and when thinking about girls, he would think of pink. In Japan, Peach&#x27;s name has always been since her debut in the original &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; in 1985. However, she was localized as &quot;Princess Toadstool&quot; in the English-language manual. The English version of &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Safari&quot;, released in 1993, contained the first usage of the name &quot;Peach&quot; in the Western world, though she was called Princess Toadstool in &quot;Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3&quot;, released in 1994. In &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, released in 1996, she uses both names in a letter addressed to Mario, signing it &quot;Peach&quot;. From the 1996 game &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot; onward, the name Peach is used in Western versions.

=== Voice acting ===
Several voice actors have provided the English voice for Princess Peach. Since the 2007 Wii game &quot;Mario Strikers Charged&quot;, Peach has been voiced by Samantha Kelly. She has also previously been voiced by Jen Taylor. Her other voice actors include Jeannie Elias in &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!&quot;, Tracey Moore in &quot;The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; and &quot;Super Mario World&quot;, and Leslie Swan, a localization manager for Nintendo.

==Characteristics==

Peach is the princess of the Mushroom Kingdom and ruler of her subjects, known as Toads, a mushroom-like people. Although she has appeared in a variety of outfits, Peach typically wears her pink princess dress with puffy sleeves combined with long white gloves. Her royal abode is a large castle with white walls and red roof, adorned with a stained-glass portrait of the princess. Peach is the daughter of the Mushroom King (also named King Toadstool), a character that appears in the &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; comics and is mentioned in the manual for the first &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; video game but has never appeared in the video games. She is presented as one of the few humans in the kingdom, despite the Toads being the predominant race. Throughout the mainline series, the Mushroom Kingdom is under persistent attack from Bowser and his minions, and Peach&#x27;s role is to be his kidnapping victim. Her age has never been officially confirmed, but it varies between mid-teens and early twenties.

Despite being the lead female character of the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise, Princess Peach has rarely been the protagonist of &quot;Mario&quot; video games. Since the first &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; video game, she has repeatedly been the damsel in distress of the main series, typically appearing at the end of the game to reward Mario after successfully rescuing her. She is a playable character in various spin-off games and has wielded several weapons, including a frying pan and a parasol. She also demonstrates magical power, such as the ability to heal in &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot;. In the first &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; game, her white magic is the only way to undo the chaos caused by Bowser to the Mushroom Kingdom. Peach&#x27;s relationship with Mario is a central element of the series, yet it remains ambiguous. Although Nintendo describes them as friends, suggestions of a romantic relationship between Peach and Mario recur throughout the series.

==Appearances==
=== &quot;Super Mario&quot; series ===
Peach made her debut as Princess Toadstool in the 1985 platform game &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The story involves Bowser (named King Koopa) kidnapping her and hiding her in one of eight dungeons, necessitating Mario and Luigi to find and rescue her. After navigating his way through eight worlds and defeating King Koopa over a pit of lava, Mario receives a &quot;Thank you Mario!&quot; from the princess as a hero&#x27;s reward. A sequel to the game was released in Japan in 1986 as &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; and was eventually released in North America as part of &quot;Super Mario All-Stars&quot; in 1993, titled &quot;Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels&quot;. Like its predecessor, the game involves Mario or Luigi attempting to rescue the princess from Bowser. In 1988, the princess was upgraded to a playable character on the NES with the release of a second sequel titled &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot;. As one of four playable characters in the game, she had the unique ability to float over obstacles. The game was made from a preexisting Japanese game named &quot;Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic&quot; to repurpose it for a Western audience, thus, Princess Toadstool was used in place of Lina, one of the characters in the Japanese version. In the NES game &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; (1988), Mario embarks on a quest to rescue seven kings from Bowser&#x27;s Koopalings, but eventually discovers that Peach has been kidnapped by Bowser. After Mario&#x27;s quest to rescue the princess is complete, she rewards him with a joke and a dismissive &quot;Bye bye&quot;.

Princess Toadstool returned as the kidnapped princess on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) in &quot;Super Mario World&quot; (1990), which places Mario in a location called Dinosaur Land. Mario embarks on a quest that involves navigating through several locations to save Dinosaur Land from the Koopalings before rescuing the princess from Bowser. The princess is again the victim of Bowser in the 3D platform game &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; (1996), released on the Nintendo 64. The game begins with Mario receiving a letter from &quot;Princess Toadstool, Peach&quot; asking him to come to her castle as she has baked a cake for him. Peach&#x27;s Castle acts as a hub world and contains paintings that Mario can use to enter various worlds to complete challenges in order to win stars. At the end of the game, he must finally face Bowser and save the princess. After Bowser is defeated, the princess emerges from the stained-glass window that adorns the castle, having been captive within its walls. In the GameCube title &quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot; (2002), Mario, Peach, and some Toads take a holiday to Isle Delfino. Upon arrival, they find the tropical paradise is being polluted with paint by Shadow Mario, a mysterious doppelgänger of Mario. Shadow Mario is secretly Bowser&#x27;s son, Bowser Jr., in disguise, and, after framing Mario for polluting the island, he kidnaps Peach. Bowser Jr. initially accuses the princess of being his mother, but after Mario defeats Bowser and rescues Peach, Bowser confirms that Peach is not Bowser Jr.&#x27;s mother.

&quot;New Super Mario Bros.&quot; (2006) returned the series to 2D platforming on the Nintendo DS. The game centers on Princess Peach being kidnapped by Bowser Jr. and Mario traveling through eight worlds to save her. Peach initiates the events of the 2007 Wii game &quot;Super Mario Galaxy&quot; by asking Mario to come to her castle because there is something she would like to give him. The plot involves Bowser kidnapping Peach and transporting her castle into outer space. Mario&#x27;s quest requires him to complete levels and collect 60 power stars before he can travel to the center of the universe to rescue the princess. &quot;New Super Mario Bros. Wii&quot; (2009) was the first 2D side-scrolling platform game in the series to introduce multiplayer, with up to four players choosing to play as Mario, Luigi, or two Toad variations. Miyamoto said that Peach was not included as a playable character because her skirt would require special programming. The game opens with the princess being kidnapped by Bowser and his minions, necessitating Mario and Luigi to rescue her. In 2010, Nintendo released a sequel to &quot;Super Mario Galaxy&quot; with a 3D platformer on the Wii titled &quot;Super Mario Galaxy 2&quot;. Like its predecessor, the game centers on Princess Peach being abducted by Bowser, requiring Mario to travel through various worlds to save her.

The Nintendo 3DS game &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; (2011) begins with Bowser kidnapping Princess Peach at the outset. The player controls Mario as he navigates through eight worlds to rescue her, with each ending in a boss fight with one of Bowser&#x27;s henchmen. In &quot;New Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; (2012), the Mushroom Kingdom is again under attack from Bowser and his Koopalings, who kidnap Peach. The game involves Mario and Luigi traveling through platform levels, collecting coins, and fighting bosses to save the princess. In Mario&#x27;s 2012 Wii U debut, &quot;New Super Mario Bros. U&quot;, the action takes place in Dinosaur Land. The plot involves Bowser and his Koopalings taking Princess Peach hostage and Mario and friends making their way to the center of Mushroom Kingdom to save her. The game offers multiplayer for up to four players, featuring Mario, Luigi, and two Toads as playable characters. The game&#x27;s director, Masataka Takemoto, explained that Princess Peach was not included as a playable character because he wanted all of the characters to have the same moves as Mario, and Peach was not well suited for that.

Although not initially planned to appear in the 2013 Wii U video game &quot;Super Mario 3D World&quot;, Peach was suggested by producer Yoshiaki Koizumi. The game was the first in the mainline series since &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; to feature her as a playable character. Koizumi thought she could offer a more competitive choice in multiplayer. He also hoped that players would be able to play alongside their girlfriends or wives. Peach has the ability to use her gown to float while jumping, allowing her to avoid gaps and other obstacles. She can use power ups that provide various effects and boosts, such as the cat suit, which gives her the ability to crawl and climb walls like a cat. When Peach gets the Fire Flower power up, she transforms into Fire Peach, where her dress changes from pink to red and white and she can throw fireballs. In the mobile game &quot;Super Mario Run&quot; (2016), Peach is one of several playable characters and is unlocked following the completion of the World Tour mode. The story of the World Tour mode involves Peach being kidnapped by Bowser. After she is unlocked, Peach can use her floaty jump ability during gameplay.

Peach begins the Nintendo Switch game &quot;Super Mario Odyssey&quot; (2017) being abducted by Bowser, who wants to marry her. She is confined to Bowser&#x27;s flying boat, while Mario must travel the world to rescue her. At the end of the game, Bowser and Mario compete for Peach&#x27;s affections, but she rejects them both, opting to travel the world on her own. In addition to her wedding dress, Peach wears a variety of outfits on her travels. &quot;Super Mario Maker 2&quot; (2019) includes a story mode that tasks Mario with reconstructing Princess Peach&#x27;s castle. By working through 100 courses, he can collect coins to pay for the construction of parts of the castle. When the castle is complete Princess Peach allocates jobs via the Taskmaster, which unlocks wearable Mii outfits, including a Princess Peach Dress, Princess Peach Wig and, after completing all the tasks, a Princess Peach Tennis outfit. In &quot;Super Mario Bros. Wonder&quot; (2023), Princess Peach is one of several playable characters alongside Mario, Luigi, and others. The game centers on their visit to the Flower Kingdom, which is disrupted when Bowser steals the Wonder Flower and transforms into a flying castle.

=== Other &quot;Mario&quot; games ===
&quot;Princess Toadstool&#x27;s Castle Run&quot;, a game based on &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot;, which was released in 1990 on the Nelsonic Game Watch, was the first game to feature Princess Toadstool as the sole playable character. In 1993, she appeared in &quot;Mario is Missing!&quot;, an educational game developed by The Software Toolworks.

Peach is a playable character in most &quot;Mario&quot; spin-offs, including &quot;Mario Sports&quot; games, where she is a recurring character. She is one of four playable characters that appear at the beginning of &quot;Mario Golf&quot; (1999). She is one of several playable characters appearing in &quot;Mario Tennis&quot; in 2000. In &quot;Mario Golf: Advance Tour&quot; (2004), Peach is one of the Mushroom Kingdom inhabitants against which the player competes in story mode. In &quot;Mario Superstar Baseball&quot; (2005), she has a star move, which gives her the ability to obscure the ball with hearts. Peach is one of seven core characters that is playable in every game in the &quot;Mario Strikers&quot; series. In the soccer game &quot;Super Mario Strikers&quot; (2005) she is one of the team captains or strikers. Peach is one of several &quot;Mario&quot; characters that can be selected to play for a team of three on the basketball court in &quot;Mario Hoops 3-on-3&quot; (2006). In &quot;Mario Strikers Charged&quot; (2007), Peach is one of 12 team captains that can be selected for play. In &quot;Mario Strikers: Battle League&quot; (2022) Peach is one of the ten playable characters, each of whom can perform a unique move called a Hyper Strike. Peach&#x27;s special move involves kicking the ball into a heart-shaped arch and temporarily stunning other characters. Alongside Mario and Sonic, Peach is one of 14 additional playable characters that appear in &quot;Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games&quot; (2007). In the baseball game &quot;Mario Super Sluggers&quot; (2008), Peach is one of the main characters that can be chosen for the player&#x27;s team once before disappearing, unlike secondary characters who can be selected multiple times. As well as being a playable character in &quot;Mario Golf: World Tour&quot; (2014), Peach also has a course named &quot;Peach&#x27;s Playground&quot;. She performs a special move in &quot;Mario Tennis Aces&quot; (2018), which involves spinning and leaping and finishing with a heart.

She is a returning character in the kart racing game series &quot;Mario Kart&quot; and appears as one of eight playable characters in the first video game &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; (1992). A variation named Cat Peach was introduced as one of three playable characters in the first DLC pack for &quot;Mario Kart 8&quot; in 2014. The game also debuted a variation named Pink Gold Peach. &quot;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&quot; features a playable Peach, as well as Cat Peach, a baby version of Peach, and Pink Gold Peach. &quot;Mario Kart Tour&quot; increased the number of playable options and includes Cherub Baby Peach, Kimono Peach, Pink Gold Peach, Vacation Peach, and Wintertime Peach as alternate costumes.

In 1996, the princess appeared in &quot;Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars&quot;. She is one of the party members and the final character to join the team. In gameplay, she can use defensive and healing moves or attack with a weapon, such as a frying pan or parasol. The game begins with the princess being kidnapped by Bowser, resulting in Mario setting off to rescue her. Although she was named Princess Toadstool in the original game, she was renamed Princess Peach in the 2023 remake released on the Nintendo Switch.

She has been a staple character of the &quot;Mario Party&quot; series since the first &quot;Mario Party&quot;, which was released for the Nintendo 64 in 1998. In the first game, she is one of six playable Nintendo characters that can be selected in a party of one to four players. One of the game&#x27;s 2D board maps is named &quot;Peach&#x27;s Birthday Cake&quot;.

Peach appears in the &quot;Paper Mario&quot; series from the &quot;Paper Mario&quot; video game (2000). In the first game, she is kidnapped by Bowser after inviting Mario and Luigi to her castle for a party, requiring Mario to retrieve seven Star Spirits in order to rescue her. Players can play as Peach in sections of the game as she repeatedly attempts to escape the castle. In &quot;Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door&quot; (2004), Peach invites Mario to the town of Rogueport for a treasure hunt, but she is kidnapped and held in a fortress by the X-Nauts, leaving Mario to collect seven Crystal Stars while trying to find her. Players control Mario, but at the end of each of the eight chapters, the gameplay switches to Peach as she wanders around the fortress while attempting to escape. Peach is again kidnapped in &quot;Super Paper Mario&quot; (2007), in which Mario must set off to recover eight Pure Hearts in order to find her. During gameplay, Peach teams up with Mario as a playable character where she can perform a floaty jump. In &quot;Paper Mario: Sticker Star&quot; (2012), she and the Toads are enjoying a sticker festival in the Mushroom Kingdom until Bowser arrives to cause chaos, resulting in Mario collecting stickers to save the kingdom. In the 2016 follow-up game &quot;Paper Mario: Color Splash&quot;, Mario, Peach, and Toad are invited to Prism Island, which is being drained of color. When Peach is kidnapped, Mario and a paint bucket companion named Huey must save the island and Peach. In &quot;Paper Mario: The Origami King&quot; (2020), Peach and the Toads are folded into origami versions by King Olly, so Mario and friends must fight to restore them.

In the role-playing video game series &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi&quot;, Peach is a recurring character. In &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga&quot; (2003), Bowser recruits Mario and Luigi to help him restore Peach&#x27;s voice after it was sucked up into a device by a mystery guest and replaced with speech that converts to explosives. In the second entry, &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi: Partners in Time&quot; (2005), the brothers must save Peach and the Mushroom Kingdom from being conquered by the evil Shroobs by traveling between the past and the present. &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi: Bowser&#x27;s Inside Story&quot; (2009) continues Mario and Luigi&#x27;s efforts to save Peach after the villain Fawful tricks Bowser into eating a type of mushroom that causes him to inhale the Mushroom Kingdom, forcing the brothers to save Peach after being trapped inside Bowser&#x27;s body. In &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi: Dream Team&quot; (2013), Mario and Luigi must work with a character named Prince Dreambert to save Peach after she is sucked through a portal into the dreamworld while staying on Pi&#x27;illo Island. &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi: Paper Jam&quot; (2015) follows Mario and Luigi on a quest to save Peach after both she and her paper version are kidnapped by Bowser. She is also set to appear in the upcoming &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership&quot; (2024).

Peach is the protagonist and playable character of &quot;Super Princess Peach&quot; (2005), a platform game with mechanics similar to &quot;Super Mario&quot; games. Set on Vibe Island, the game begins with Bowser using the Vibe Scepter to capture Mario and Luigi, resulting in Princess Peach embarking on a quest to rescue them with the help of her talking umbrella, Perry. During the game, she must navigate levels, release captured Toads, and finally face Bowser. In gameplay, she can stomp on enemies and attack them using Perry in various ways. Peach&#x27;s health is measured with a heart meter. She also has a Vibe meter, which governs her four emotions, joy, gloom, rage, and calm. Each emotion power provides a unique ability; joy powers her to float in a cyclone, gloom creates floods of tears, rage engulfs her in flames, and calm restores her health.

Peach appears in two turn-based crossover games between the &quot;Mario&quot; and Ubisoft&#x27;s &quot;Rabbids&quot; franchises. In &quot;Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle&quot;, the player begins with three characters, one of which is Rabbid Peach, a Rabbid version of Peach, who has the ability to heal allies and perform a stylish dash, which can kill multiple enemies. After being unlocked at the end of World 2, Peach is also a playable character and carries a short-range shotgun called a boomshot and tosses grenades at enemies. She also has the ability to perform a healing jump to heal allies. Peach and her Rabbid counterpart return along with other Nintendo characters in &quot;Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope.&quot;

In 2019, a variant named Dr. Peach was introduced as one of ten playable characters in the mobile puzzle game &quot;Dr. Mario World&quot;. Her special skill cleared a row of objects when her skill meter was full. Another variant named Dr. Fire Peach was later added in 2020.

Peach stars in the Nintendo Switch game &quot;Princess Peach: Showtime!,&quot; which was released March 22, 2024. With a focus on a theatrical theme, it centers around Peach saving Sparkle Theatre from the antagonist Grape and her minions, the Sour Bunch. With the help of Stella, the theater&#x27;s guardian, she can change into various outfits with specific abilities. Her transformations include Swordfighter Peach, Patissier Peach, Kung Fu Peach, Detective Peach, Figure Skater Peach, Mermaid Peach and Mighty Peach. The game is the first to feature Peach as the protagonist since the release of &quot;Super Princess Peach&quot;.

=== Other video games ===
Peach is a playable character in the fighting game series &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; and has appeared in every game since being introduced in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;. Upon her debut in &quot;Melee&quot;, her moveset included the ability to float in the air and throw turnips at opponents. &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot; introduced her final smash, Peach Blossom, which causes opponents to fall asleep and take damage. In &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, her fighting moves include using Toad as a shield, jumping upwards and using her parasol to float down, and her final smash, Peach Blossom. Peach is one of several playable &quot;Mario&quot; characters that appears alongside characters from the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series in &quot;Itadaki Street DS&quot;, a &quot;Monopoly&quot;-style board game published by Square Enix. In May 2016, a Super Mario Mash Up Pack released as downloadable content for the Wii U edition of &quot;Minecraft&quot; featured Peach as one of 12 skins used as playable Nintendo characters. Peach&#x27;s Castle was also recreated as a location in the game. Peach has also made cameo appearances in non-&quot;Mario&quot; games. She is depicted in a painting in Hyrule Castle in &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot;. In &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Link&#x27;s Awakening&quot;, a character named Christine sends her picture to a letter writer named Mr. Write, but it is a portrait of Princess Peach. She features as a playable guest character alongside Mario and Luigi in the GameCube versions of the &quot;Electronic Arts&quot; games &quot;NBA Street V3&quot; and &quot;SSX on Tour&quot;.

=== Other media ===
In 1986, a Japanese anime film was produced titled &quot;Super Mario Bros.: The Great Mission to Rescue Princess Peach!&quot;. Written by Hideo Takayashiki and directed by Masami Hata, it was based on the events of the first &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; video game. The story involves Princess Peach escaping from the video game world into Mario&#x27;s world before being captured and pulled back to the Mushroom Kingdom by King Koopa. Mario and Luigi are lured into the Mushroom Kingdom by a dog in order to save her.

In September 1989, Peach appeared in &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!&quot;, a cartoon series by DiC that aired for one season. In this incarnation, she is referred to as Princess Toadstool and is a redhead. She is voiced by Jeannie Elias in &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!&quot; and Tracey Moore in the two follow up series &quot;The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; and &quot;Super Mario World&quot;.

Throughout 1992, Peach (named Princess Toadstool) appeared in a comic titled &quot;Super Mario Adventures&quot;, which was serialized in &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;. The plot involves Bowser proposing marriage to her and threatening to turn her subjects to stone if she refuses. After Mario is turned to stone, she and her troops pursue Bowser down a pipe, but she is eventually captured by Bowser. Rather than remaining idle, she demonstrates resourcefulness in various ways, including tricking her way out of her cell, escaping from a window using a yellow cape, and popping out of a pizza box holding a bomb in an effort to save Mario.

Princess Peach is also prominently featured within Universal Studios Japan and Universal Studios Hollywood&#x27;s immersive Super Nintendo World areas. A costume character meet-and-greet with her is located in her pavilion. The interactive &quot;Power-Up Bands&quot; feature a design based on her dress.
Peach is voiced by Anya Taylor-Joy in &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot; (2023). Her casting, alongside the rest of the principal cast, was announced via a Nintendo Direct in September 2021. In the film, Peach is Mario&#x27;s guide and romantic interest, having been raised by the Toads from infancy in the Mushroom Kingdom. Director Aaron Horvath said that Luigi became the victim Mario must save, to substitute Peach&#x27;s traditional role in video games as the damsel in distress, so she can remain a strong monarch and protector of the Toads. Taylor-Joy said that she was concerned before taking the role, but that her portrayal of Peach as a strong, capable leader was &quot;the way she was supposed to be&quot;. A song from the film, which was titled &quot;Peaches&quot; and written and performed by Bowser voice actor Jack Black, was released in April 2023.

== Merchandise ==
Peach has been merchandised across a range of official products, including plush toys and action figures. An amiibo of Peach wearing a pink gown was released for the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series in November 2014. In 2015, another version was released as part of a set of &quot;Super Mario&quot; amiibo. In 2017, a set of themed amiibo was released for &quot;Super Mario Odyssey&quot;, including an amiibo of Peach wearing a wedding outfit. A limited edition double pack featuring Cat Peach alongside Cat Mario was released for &quot;Super Mario 3D World + Bowser&#x27;s Fury&quot; in February 2021. In December 2014, a rare legless Peach amiibo resulting from a factory defect achieved a &quot;Guinness World Record&quot; for being the most expensive amiibo figure. Peach&#x27;s color scheme and crown motif have been used to market themed controllers, including a pink Wii Remote Plus controller in 2014 and a pastel pink Joy-Con for the Switch in 2024. She has also featured in other licensed &quot;Mario&quot; products, including as an interactive figure in the Lego Super Mario range and as a Hot Wheels collectible.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
Sam Loveridge of &quot;Digital Spy&quot; described Peach as one of the most iconic female game characters of all time, naming her an icon that transcends gaming and commenting that she &quot;acts as one of Nintendo&#x27;s main mascots on a worldwide scale.&quot; &quot;SyFy&quot; also described Peach as one of the &quot;greatest video game heroines of all time&quot; for being a tough female character that &quot;embraces the power of being a high femme&quot;. Alyse Knorr, writer for &quot;Kotaku&quot;, noted that Peach is one of many examples of the damsel in distress trope that recurs throughout history, commenting that she is such a damsel cliché that she mainly existed as a plot device rather than as an individual character and that her role was to provide Mario with a reason to exist. Feminist organization Sister Namibia was critical of the fact that Peach always needed to be rescued by reasoning that &quot;it propagates that women are helpless and in constant need of saving&quot; and &quot;[she] serves quite literally as a trophy for the completion of Mario&#x27;s quest. She is ultimately just another object or reward for Mario to use&quot;. Mike Fahey of &quot;Kotaku&quot; created a &quot;victimization record&quot; for Princess Peach that detailed her many kidnappings within the series, commenting, &quot;There are few women with more kidnappings under their belt than her royal mushroom highness.&quot; In an article about the impact of princesses on girls, Peggy Orenstein of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that she loved Peach but noted that &quot;her peachiness did nothing to upset the apple cart of expectation&quot;. She considered Peach to be an ideal postfeminist solution by &quot;the melding of old and new standards&quot;.

Josh Straub of &quot;Game Informer&quot; cited the repeated failure to find the princess in the first &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; game as one of the most memorable moments in gaming history, stating that reaching the end of a world and being told by a Toad, &quot;But our princess is in another castle!&quot; was a &quot;method of torture&quot; that forced the player to face another round of platforming. Peter Tieryas, writer of &quot;Kotaku&quot;, considered Peach to be the best character in &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; and emphasized that her floating ability was the first of Nintendo&#x27;s solutions for fine-tuning jumping in platform games. Matt Kamen of &quot;Wired&quot; appreciated the plot of &quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot; for having &quot;a bit more impetus to a game than &#x27;rescue Peach (again)&#x27;&quot; and felt that this offered more depth and personality to the characters. &quot;Video Games Chronicle&quot;″s Chris Scullion said that Peach&#x27;s starring role in &quot;Super Princess Peach&quot; should have been a turning point for the character, but ended up as &quot;an average platformer with a questionable central mechanic&quot; by focusing on her &quot;getting emotional&quot;. In his review of &quot;Super Princess Peach&quot;, Mark Bozon of &quot;IGN&quot; thought that Peach&#x27;s emotion powers and use of coins to shop were &quot;borderline insulting&quot; and seemed like &quot;a girls game made by guys&quot;. Mike Sholars of &quot;Kotaku&quot; felt that the introduction of Rosalina in &quot;Super Mario Galaxy&quot; impacted the &quot;Super Mario&quot; series so that it no longer needed to rely on the concept of saving the princess and enabled Peach to be more than a plot device.

Bryan Vore of &quot;Game Informer&quot; praised &quot;Super Mario 3D World&quot; for being the first game in 25 years of the mainline series since &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; to include Peach as a playable character, saying that it demonstrated Nintendo&#x27;s willingness to change the formula. Chris Suellentrop, writer for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, opined that &quot;Super Mario Run&quot; was not a family-friendly game due to its &quot;stale, retrograde gender stereotypes&quot; and said that Nintendo had failed to update &quot;Super Mario&quot; for a contemporary audience by beginning the game with Princess Peach being a hostage. Sam Loveridge of &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; felt that in &quot;Super Mario Odyssey&quot;, Nintendo &quot;was playing him from the start&quot; by beginning the game with Peach being abducted by Bowser and ending it with a scene in which she rejects the romantic advances of both Bowser and Mario. He commented that Peach &quot;shrugs off all those years of being the damsel in distress to forge her own path in the world as a single woman&quot; and that in doing so Nintendo was clearly recognizing its female fanbase. Rebekah Valentine of &quot;IGN&quot; said that &quot;Princess Peach: Showtime!&quot; was the opportunity to see Peach &quot;defined only by herself&quot; rather than by Mario. Following the game&#x27;s release, Tom Regan of &quot;The Guardian&quot; found the game to be disappointing and considered it to be &quot;patronising&quot; to its &quot;capable heroine&quot; and a wasted opportunity to celebrate the princess. Conversely, &quot;Polygon&quot;, &quot;IGN&quot; and &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; all responded positively and considered it to be the spotlight she deserved. Ashley Bardhan of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; said that, rather than casting Peach in her usual role of Bowser&#x27;s victim, the game made her a &quot;girl with some agency&quot; and thought that her future was &quot;no longer doomed with dead-end kidnapping&quot; but now had limitless potential.

&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;″ writer, Tracy Brown, said that Peach started out as an unappealing character due to being simply a princess waiting to be rescued but was given more personality in later games. She further remarked that &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot; incarnation had subverted her characteristics by depicting an empowered ruler who is capable of engaging in battle and protecting her subjects without it being at the expense of her femininity. Christian Holub of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; responded positively to Peach&#x27;s characterization in the film, calling her &quot;a female protagonist for the Rey generation&quot; but also a relatable character for older players. Hope Bellingham, writer of &quot;GamesRadar+&quot;, appreciated her active role in the story, describing her as &quot;the brains behind the operation&quot;, even though Mario has the starring role. By contrast, Julia Glassman of &quot;The Mary Sue&quot; considered her film incarnation to be a common sexist trope where the badass female character must step aside for an average male by supporting and training him rather than taking the lead. Gene Park, writer of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, felt that Peach had been empowered long before her movie incarnation due to being &quot;the most visible woman in video games, having appeared in more titles than any fictional woman in the medium&quot; and hoped that the movie would finally transform her image in the public consciousness. Logan Plant of &quot;IGN&quot; described Peach as &quot;one of Nintendo&#x27;s most iconic characters&quot; and felt that Nintendo was finally giving her the attention she deserved in film and video games.

===Legacy===
Peach has been described as one of the greatest video game characters by game websites and publications, including the 2011 version of the &quot;Guinness World Records Gamer&#x27;s Edition&quot; and &quot;GameSpot&quot;, which described her as &quot;arguably the most famous woman in video game history&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; named Peach as one of the most influential video game characters of all time, describing her as the &quot;quintessential damsel in distress&quot;, but noted that Nintendo had improved her status over time by making her a playable character and introducing her in other game series like &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; Peach was cited to be an influence on other video game developers creating strong female protagonists. Tracey John, writing for &quot;Time&quot;, commented that Peach&#x27;s repeated abductions had become a running joke and a pop culture reference. In 2018, a short comic &quot;The Super Crown&#x27;s some spicy new Mario lore&quot; on DeviantArt and Twitter transformed Bowser into a monstrously sinister female resembling Peach that fans named Bowsette, which inspired numerous works of fan art. In May 2021, in an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, Grimes dressed as Princess Peach, while host Elon Musk starred as Wario in a sketch in which he was put on trial for murdering Mario in a kart race.

<doc id="81439" wikidata="Q19610511" url="?curid=81439" title="Township">
<text>A township is a form of human settlement or administrative subdivision. Its exact definition varies among countries.

Although the term is occasionally associated with an urban area, that tends to be an exception to the rule. In Australia, Canada, Scotland, and parts of the United States, the term refers to settlements too small or scattered to be considered urban.

==Australia==

&quot;The Australian National Dictionary&quot; defines a township as &quot;a site reserved for and laid out as a town; such a site at an early stage of its occupation and development; a small town&quot;. 

The term refers purely to the settlement; it does not refer to a unit of government. Townships are governed as part of a larger council (such as that of a shire, district or city) or authority.

==Canada==
In Canada, two kinds of township occur in common use:

*In Eastern Canada, a township is one form of the subdivision of a county. In Canadian French, this is a . Townships are referred to as &quot;lots&quot; in Prince Edward Island; they merely form census subdivisions and are not administrative units. In Canada, a municipality is a city, town, township, county, or regional municipality which has been incorporated by statute by the legislatures of the provinces and territories.
*In Western Canada, townships exist only for the purpose of land division by the Dominion Land Survey and do not form administrative units. These townships are nominally six miles by six miles (36 square miles, or roughly 93 km2). Townships are designated by their township number and range number. Township 1 is the first north of the First Base Line, and the numbers increase to the north. While not an administrative unit, Alberta and Saskatchewan do have numbered township and range roads in rural areas based on the old Dominion Land Survey. In Saskatchewan and Manitoba, rural municipalities, township-like administrative units below the provincial level, are made up of groups of said surveyed townships.

==China==

In China, townships are found at the fourth level of the administrative hierarchy, below counties, districts, and county level cities but above villages and communities, together with ethnic townships, towns and subdistricts.

==India==
In India, townships are found at the fourth level of the city.

==Jersey==
In Jersey, &quot;township&quot; is a redundant term, as the only surviving local government level at present are the 12 parishes of the island.

==Malaysia==

In Malaysia, townships are found at the third level of the administrative hierarchy, is a subdivision of a &#x27; (district or county) or autonomous sub-district (&#x27;), while above &quot;&quot; (village) and (residential neighbourhood) as defined in the National Land Code, adopted in 1965.

==New Zealand==
In New Zealand, towns and townships no longer exist; all land is part of either a city, which is mostly urban, or a district, which is mostly rural. Since 1979, municipalities have existed in New Zealand but are rare and not formally defined legally.

As a term, however, townships are still in common usage in New Zealand, used in referring to a small town or urban community located in a rural area. The term is generally comparable to that of a village in England.

==Pakistan==

==Philippines==
In the Philippines, townships refer to administrative divisions established during the American Civil Government in the country. Many of these political divisions were originally established as rancherias during the Spanish Regime. The term was later replaced with &quot;municipal district&quot;. Most municipal districts would later be converted into regular municipalities by executive orders from the Philippine president.

Mambukal, a hill station geographically located in Murcia, Negros Occidental, is the only legally constituted township in the Philippines, created under Republic Act No. 1964, approved in June 1957.

As a term, the word &quot;township&quot; in the Philippines is used to refer to new developments with their own amenities, including both vertical and horizontal projects. The modern and largest townships in the Philippines are New Clark City with 9,450 hectares in Capas of Tarlac, Hamilo Coast with 5,900 hectares in Nasugbu of Batangas, Nuvali with 2,290 hectares in Santa Rosa of Laguna, Lancaster New City with 2,000 hectares in Kawit Imus GenTri of Cavite, Vista City with 1,500 hectares in Las Piñas Muntinlupa of Metro Manila, and Dasmariñas of Cavite, Twin Lakes with 1,149 hectares in Tagaytay of Cavite and Alviera with 1,125 hectares in Porac of Pampanga. The majority of the current townships are near Metro Manila, which permits faster access to the capital region by road or rail transport.

==Post-Soviet countries==

The former Russian Empire, Soviet Union, and Commonwealth of Independent States states is sometimes used to denote a small semi-urban, sometimes industrial, settlement and used to translate the terms &#x27; (townlet), &#x27; (&#x27;), &#x27; (&quot;mestechko&quot;, from Polish &quot;&quot;, a small town; in the cases of predominant Jewish population the latter is sometimes translated as shtetl).

==South Africa==
In South Africa under apartheid, the term &quot;township&quot; was used to describe residential developments that confined non-Whites, including Blacks, Coloureds, and Indians, living near or working in White-only communities. Soweto and Mdantsane were both prominent townships under apartheid. The term also has a precise legal meaning and is used on land titles in all areas regardless of the demographics of the respective region.

==Taiwan==

In Taiwan, townships are administered by a county together with a county-administered city. There are three types of townships in Taiwan: urban townships, rural townships, and mountain indigenous townships. Mountain indigenous townships are those with significant populations of Taiwanese aborigines.

==Thailand==

==United Kingdom==
===England===
In England, the term &quot;township&quot; is no longer in official use, but still maintains some meaning, typically used to describe subdivisions of large parishes for administrative purposes. This definition became legally obsolete at the end of the 19th century when local government reform converted many townships that had been subdivisions of ancient parishes into the newer civil parishes, which formally separated the connection between the ecclesiastical functions of ancient parishes and the civil administrative functions that had been introduced in these areas beginning in the 16th century. As of the 21st century, some councils, mostly in Northern England, have revived the term.

===Scotland===

In Scotland, the term is still used for some rural settlements. In parts of the Highlands and Islands, a township is a crofting settlement. In the Highlands generally the term may describe a very small agrarian community.

===Wales===
In Wales, the term &quot;township&quot; is used to describe a population center created by an Act of Parliament in 1539, such as the Townships in Montgomeryshire.

==United States==

In the United States, a township is a subdivision of a county and is usually 36 square miles (about 93 square kilometres) in area. There are two types of townships in the United States: civil and survey. A state may have one or both types. In states that have both, the boundaries often coincide in many counties.

* A civil township is a unit of local government in the U.S., which is subordinate to a county. Specific responsibilities and the degree of vary based on the laws of the respective state. In many states, townships are organized and operate under the authority of state statutes, similar to counties. In others, townships operate as municipal corporations, which are chartered entities with a degree of home rule. Notable exceptions include New Jersey and Pennsylvania, where townships are a class of incorporation with fixed boundaries and equal standing to a village, town, borough, or city, analogous to a New England town or towns in New York.

* A survey township is a unit of land measure defined by the Public Land Survey System, which in many states has no governmental function.

===Puerto Rico===

In the first U.S. census of Puerto Rico, the population centers known as townships were referred to as &quot;barrios,&quot; a term first used when Puerto Rico was under Spanish colonial
rule. 

Like townships in most U.S. states, barrios are subdivisions and function as municipalities.

==Vietnam==
In Vietnam, a commune-level town () is similar to a township; it is a subdivision of a rural district () and is the lowest administration subdivision in the country.

==Zimbabwe==
In Zimbabwe, the term township was used for segregated parts of suburban areas. During colonial years in Rhodesia, the term &quot;township&quot; referred to a residential area reserved for Black citizens within the boundaries of a city or town and is still commonly used colloquially. This reflected the South African usage.

In present-day Zimbabwe, the term is also used to refer to a residential area within close proximity of a rural growth point.

<text>Jacob&#x27;s Mouse were a three-piece indie rock band from Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England, consisting of identical twins Hugo and Jebb Boothby on guitar and bass respectively, and singing drummer Sam Marsh.

==History==
The band members first got together when they were aged 11. They initially played covers, but progressed to original material inspired by bands they heard on John Peel&#x27;s radio show, such as Dog Faced Hermans. They adopted the name Jacob&#x27;s Mouse, a reference to a cousin&#x27;s pet. 

Their first release, &quot;The Dot EP&quot;, was named &#x27;single of the week&#x27; by &quot;Sounds&quot;, and they went on to play support slots with bands such as Nirvana, Carter USM, and Senseless Things. They released their first album, &quot;No Fish Shop Parking,&quot; on their own Blithering Idiot label. It was well received by critics; &quot;Option&quot; magazine described them as &quot;the current embodiment of the rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll spirit&quot;. It led to airplay on Peel and Mark Goodier&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 shows, and they went on to record two sessions for Peel&#x27;s show in 1992.

The band signed to Wiiija and toured with Babes in Toyland. In September 1992, they released their &quot;Ton Up&quot; EP and signed with Frontier Records in the United States. Their second album, &quot;I&#x27;m Scared&quot;, was released in April 1993, and received a four star review in &quot;Select&quot;.

A compilation of tracks from singles and EPs, &quot;Wryly Smilers&quot;, was released in September 1994.

Their third album, &quot;Rubber Room&quot;, was released in February 1995. The band split up later that year. Marsh went on to record a few singles and three albums as The Machismo&#x27;s, and played in hardcore punk band Volunteers for a time, before forming dub band Zen Reggae Masters.

<text>The Naskapi (Nascapi, Naskapee, Nascapee) are an Indigenous people of the Subarctic native to the historical region St&#x27;aschinuw (ᒋᑦ ᐊᔅᒋᓄᐤ, meaning &#x27;our [inclusive] land&#x27;), which was located in present day northern Quebec and Labrador, neighbouring Nunavik. They are closely related to Innu People, who call their homeland &quot;Nitassinan&quot;.

Innu people are frequently divided into two groups, the Neenoilno (called &quot;Montagnais&quot; by French people) who live along the north shore of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, in Quebec, and the less numerous Naskapi who live farther north. The Innu themselves recognize several distinctions (e.g. Mushuau Innuat, Maskuanu Innut, Uashau Innuat) based on different regional affiliations and various dialects of the Innu language.

The word &quot;Naskapi&quot; (meaning &quot;people beyond the horizon&quot;) first made an appearance in the 17th century and was subsequently applied to Innu groups beyond the reach of missionary influence, most notably those living in the lands which bordered Ungava Bay and the northern Labrador coast, near the Inuit communities of northern Quebec and northern Labrador. The Naskapi are traditionally nomadic peoples, in contrast with the territorial Montagnais. Mushuau Innuat (plural), while related to the Naskapi, split off from the tribe in the 20th century and were subject to a government relocation program at Davis Inlet. The Naskapi language and culture is quite different from the Montagnais, in which the dialect changes from y to n as in &quot;Iiyuu&quot; versus &quot;Innu&quot;. Some of the families of Naskapi Nation of Kawawachikamach have close relatives in the Cree village of Whapmagoostui, on the eastern shore of Hudson Bay.

==History==

===Post-European contact===
The earliest written reference to Naskapi appears around 1643, when the Jesuit André Richard referred to the &quot;Ounackkapiouek&quot;, but little is known about the group to which Richard was referring, other than that they were one of many &quot;small nations&quot; situated somewhere north of Tadoussac. The word &quot;Naskapi&quot; appeared for the first time in 1733, at which time the group so described was said to number approximately forty families and to have an important camp at Ashuanipi Lake. At approximately the same time, in 1740, Joseph Isbister, the manager of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s post at Eastmain, reported being told that there were Indians, whom he called &quot;Annes-carps&quot; to the northeast of Richmond Gulf. In later years those Indians came to be called variously &quot;Nascopie&quot; and &quot;Nascappe&quot;. Not many years later, in 1790, the Periodical Accounts of the Moravian Missionaries described a group of Indians living west of Okak as &quot;Nascopies&quot;. The Naskapi came under the influence of Protestant missionaries, and remain Protestant to this day. In addition to their native tongue, they speak English, in contrast to their Montagnais cousins who are for the most part Roman Catholic, speaking the native language and French. The Montagnais are far more numerous than the Naskapi.
The years 1831 onwards were characterized by the first regular contacts between the Naskapi and western society, when the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company established its first trading post at Old Fort Chimo.

The relationship between the Naskapi and the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company was not an easy one. It was difficult for the Naskapi to integrate commercial trapping, especially of marten in Winter, into their seasonal round of subsistence activities, for the simple reason that the distribution of marten was in large measure different from the distribution of essential sources of food at that season. In consequence, the Naskapi did not prove to be the regular and diligent trappers that the traders must have hoped to find, and the traders seem to have attributed this fact to laziness or intransigence on the part of Naskapi.

In the 1945 census (in the Dominion of Newfoundland) the total Innu population in Labrador (consisting of both Montagnais and Naskapi) was 100 in Davis Inlet, 33 in Nain and 137 in North West River/Sheshatshiu (270 in total, it has since increased to over 2,000). The previous census in 1935 only counted Innu in David Inlet. Some surnames listed in the census including Rich, Michimagaua, Mishimapu and Pokue. Most Innu in Labrador did not have surnames until after confederation in 1949. None of the Innu lived in modern houses but instead camped in tents near North West River, Nain and Davis Inlet (all Inuit settlements) during the summer.

After a 1948 visit to Fort Chimo to measure local duck populations, a Canadian biologist reported that the Naskapi at that location: 
===Relocations===
Between 1831 and 1956, the Naskapi were subjected to several major relocations, all of which reflected not their needs nor interests, but those of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. The major moves were:
*1842 – Fort Chimo to Fort Nascopie
*1870 – Fort Nascopie to Fort Chimo
*1915 – Fort Chimo to Fort McKenzie
*1948 – Fort McKenzie to Fort Chimo
*1956 – Fort Chimo to Schefferville

Numerous cases have been documented in which the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company relocated the Naskapi from post to post purely for its own commercial purposes, and without any concern as to whether the areas where the posts were situated offered the Naskapi the possibility of harvesting the fish and game that they required for food as well as the fur-bearers that the Company sought. In several instances, individual managers, apparently dissatisfied with the Naskapi&#x27; seeming lack of commitment to trapping withheld from them the ammunition that they needed to hunt for food, thereby directly causing a considerable number of deaths from starvation.

===20th century===
By the late 1940s, the pressures of the fur trade, high rates of mortality and debilitation from diseases communicated by Europeans, and the effects of the virtual disappearance of the George River Caribou Herd had reduced the Naskapi to a state where their very survival was threatened.

The Naskapi had received relief from the Federal Government as early as the end of the 19th century, but their first regular contacts with the Federal Government began only in 1949, when Colonel H.M. Jones, Superintendent of Welfare Services in Ottawa, and M. Larivière of the Abitibi Indian Agency visited them in Fort Chimo and arranged for the issuing of welfare to them.

In the early 1950s, the Naskapi made a partially successful effort to re-establish themselves at Fort McKenzie, where they had already lived between 1916 and 1948, and to return to an economy based substantially on hunting, fishing and commercial trapping. They could no longer be entirely self-sufficient, however, and the high cost of resupplying them, combined with the continuing high incidence of tuberculosis and other factors, obliged them to return to Fort Chimo after only two years.

====Move to Schefferville====
For reasons that are not entirely clear, virtually all of the Naskapi moved from Fort Chimo to the recently founded iron-ore mining community of Schefferville in 1956. Two principal schools of thought about this move exist. One of them holds that the Naskapi were induced, if not ordered, to move by officials of Indian and Northern Affairs, while the other believes that the Naskapi themselves decided to move in the hope of finding employment, housing, medical assistance, and educational facilities for their children.

Although officials of Indian and Northern Affairs were certainly aware of the intention of the Naskapi to move from Fort Chimo to Schefferville and may even have instigated that move, they appear to have done little or nothing to prepare for their arrival there, not even by warning the representatives of the Iron Ore Company of Canada (&quot;IOCC&quot;) or the municipality of Schefferville.

The Naskapi left Fort Chimo on foot to make the journey to Schefferville overland. By the time they reached Wakuach Lake, some north of Schefferville, most of them were in a pitiable state, exhausted, ill, and close to starvation.

A successful rescue effort was mounted, but the only homes that awaited the Naskapi were the shacks that they built for themselves on the edge of Pearce Lake, near the railroad station, with scavenged and donated materials. A short time later, in 1957, under the pretext that the water at Pearce Lake was contaminated, the municipal authorities moved them to a site adjacent to John Lake, some four miles (6 km) north-north-east of Schefferville, where they lived without benefit of water sewage, or electricity, and where, despite their hopes in coming to Schefferville, there was no school for their children and no medical facility.

The Naskapi shared the site at John Lake with a group of Montagnais, who had moved voluntarily from Sept-Îles to Schefferville with the completion of the railroad in the early 1950s.

Initially, the Naskapi lived in tiny shacks that they built for themselves, but by 1962 Indian and Northern Affairs had built 30 houses for them, and a further four were under construction at a cost of $5,000 each.

====Move to Matimekosh====
In 1969, Indian and Northern Affairs acquired from the reluctant Municipality of Schefferville, a marshy, site north of the town centre and adjacent to Pearce Lake. By 1972, 43 row-housing units had been built there for the Naskapi, and a further 63 for Montagnais, and most of the Naskapi and Montagnais moved to this new site, known today as Matimekosh.

For the first time in their lengthy history of relocations, the Naskapi were consulted in the planning of their new home. Indian and Northern Affairs sent officials to explain the new community to the Naskapi, a brochure was published, models built, and progress reports issued. Particular interest among the Naskapi centred on the type of housing that they would receive. Possibly for financial reasons, Indian and Northern Affairs wanted them to live in row houses, whereas the Naskapi had a strong preference for detached, single-family residences. In the event, Council was persuaded to accept row housing, but it did so only on the condition that the houses were adequately sound-proofed, which turned out not to be the case.

Perhaps because it was the first such process in which they had been involved, the Naskapi placed considerable faith in the consultation undertaken by Indian and Northern Affairs. It is a source of considerable bitterness even today that, in the minds of many Naskapi, not all of the promises or reassurances that were made were lived up to. Two examples are most commonly cited: the insistence of Indian and Northern Affairs&#x27; representatives that the Naskapi live in row houses that, in the event, proved not to be adequately soundproofed and that had a variety of other faults; and the fact that the brochure prepared by Indian and Northern Affairs showed a fully landscaped site with trees and bushes, whereas no landscaping was done, and no trees or bushes were ever planted.

Incidents like those may seem very minor to persons with long experience of large and impersonal institutions such as government departments, but they happened to the Naskapi when they were in a very formative stage of their relations with Indian and Northern Affairs and when they had still not forgotten their callous treatment by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. It should not come as a surprise, therefore, that these matters are still spoken of frequently today and that they maintain very considerable importance and significance for many Naskapi.

====James Bay Agreement====
A pivotal event in the history of the Naskapi occurred in early 1975, when, after separate visits to Schefferville by Billy Diamond, Grand Chief, Grand Council of the Crees (of Quebec) (&quot;GCCQ&quot;), and Charlie Watt, President, Northern Quebec Inuit Association (&quot;NQIA&quot;), the Naskapi decided to become involved in the negotiations leading to the signature of the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement (&quot;JBNQA&quot;).

The Naskapi entered into a contract with the NQIA, under which the latter was to provide logistical support, legal advice, and representation to a small team of Naskapi negotiators based in Montreal. That arrangement was not very successful (how?), however, and the JBNQA was signed on 11 November 1975, without the Naskapi.

Shortly before the signing of the JBNQA, realizing that the demands on the Inuit were too great to allow them to represent the interests of the Naskapi in addition to their own interests, the Naskapi negotiators retained their own non-Native advisors and started to function as an independent negotiating body.

The signatories of the JBNQA were fully aware that it provided for the extinguishment of the Naskapi&#x27; Aboriginal rights in the Territory without granting them any compensatory rights or benefits. They also knew that the Naskapi, unlike certain others of Quebec&#x27;s First Nations at that time, were willing to negotiate a settlement of their Aboriginal claims.

Thus, although the Naskapi had never filed a formal statement of claim or similar document, except for a draft history prepared by the late Alan Cooke, the parties to the JBNQA accepted the legitimacy of their claims, and they entered into an agreement-in-principle with the Naskapi in the Spring of 1977 to negotiate an agreement that would have the same principal features as the JBNQA. The result of the negotiations was the Northeastern Quebec Agreement (&quot;NEQA&quot;), which was executed on 31 January 1978.

Section 20 of the NEQA offered the Naskapi the possibility of relocating from the Matimekosh Reserve to a new site.

====Move to Kawawachikamach====
Between 1978 and 1980, technical and socio-economic studies of the potential sites for the permanent Naskapi community were carried out. On 31 January 1980, the Naskapi voted overwhelmingly to relocate to the present site of Kawawachikamach, built largely by Naskapi between 1980 and 1983. The planning and building gave Naskapi training and experience in administration and in construction and maintenance trades.

Between 1981 and 1984, the self-government legislation promised by Canada in Section 7 of the NEQA was negotiated. The outcome of those negotiations was the Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act (&quot;CNQA&quot;), which was assented to by Parliament on 14 June 1984.

The overriding purpose of the CNQA was to make the NNK and the James Bay Cree Bands largely self-governing. In addition to the powers then exercised by band councils under the &quot;Indian Act&quot;, most of the powers that had until then been exercised by the Minister of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (&quot;DIAND&quot;) under the &quot;Indian Act&quot; were transferred to the NNK and to the James Bay Cree bands, to be exercised by their elected councils. The NNK and the James Bay Cree bands were also given powers not found in the &quot;Indian Act&quot;, powers normally exercised by non-Native municipalities throughout Canada.

The NEQA had been negotiated under the assumption that Schefferville would continue to be an active centre of mining, outfitting, and exploration for the foreseeable future. Inquiries by the Government of Quebec to the Iron Ore Company of Canada (&quot;IOCC&quot;) in the late 1970s had confirmed that assumption. Nevertheless, IOCC announced in 1982 its intention to close the mines at Schefferville immediately.

The closing of the mines at Schefferville had profound implications for the implementation of the NEQA, particularly for those provisions dealing with health and social services and with training and job-creation. Consequently, in the late 1980s, the NNK and the Government of Canada undertook a joint evaluation of Canada&#x27;s discharging of its responsibilities under the NEQA. The evaluation was motivated more by the change in the circumstances of Schefferville and of the Naskapi than by any belief on the part of the Naskapi that Canada had wilfully neglected any of its responsibilities under the NEQA.

====Northeastern Quebec Agreement====
The outcome of those negotiations was the Agreement Respecting the Implementation of the Northeastern Quebec Agreement (&quot;ARINEQA&quot;), which was executed in September 1990. Among other things, the ARINEQA established the model for funding capital and O&amp;M expenditures over five-year periods, created a Dispute Resolution Mechanism for disputes arising from the interpretation, administration, and implementation of the NEQA, the JBNQA, and the ARINEQA, and created a working group to address employment for Naskapi.

==Economic and community development==
The Naskapi are now developing their homeland, notably through economic development and community reinforcement.

Economic Development Projects:
* Schefferville Airport Corporation - Runway Maintenance (with Naskapi Development Corp./Montagnais of Matimekosh/Lac John )
* James Bay TransTaiga Road Maintenance (with Naskapi Adoshouana Services/NDC subsidiary)
* Naskapi Typonomy Project (with Naskapi Adoshouana Services/NDC subsidiary)
* Menihek Power Dam and Facilities (with Kawawachikamach Energy Services Inc.)
* Enterprise, Resource, Planning, and Management Software (Naskapi Imuun Inc. (Naskapi Nation))

Sectors of Activity currently being developed:
* Commercialization of Caribou (Naskapi Caribou Meat Company/Nunavik Arctic Foods)
* Caribou Hunting and Fishing Operations (TUKTU- Hunting/Fishing Club/Naskapi Management Serv.)

== Religion ==
Due to their geographic isolation, the Naskapi were initially less affected by missionaries than other groups. One primary spiritual influence was &quot;Moose-Fly&quot; (&quot;Məsəna´kʷ&quot;), a spirit often accompanied by actual moose-flies, who would sting people during salmon-fishing season in the summer. Humans had to obey the Moose-Fly spirit&#x27;s commands, including a taboo around making fun of fish for having extra-large eyes. Salmon was a vital resource for the Naskapi, so the Moose-Fly&#x27;s commands carried great weight.

==Naskapi First Nations==

===Naskapi Nation of Kawawachikamach===
Naskapi Nation of Kawawachikamach (the &quot;Nation&quot;), originally known as the &quot;“Naskapis de Schefferville Indian Band”&quot; and later as the &quot;“Naskapi Band of Quebec”&quot;, is a First Nation in with a population of approximately 850 registered First Nations people, who are also beneficiaries of the Northeastern Quebec Agreement (&quot;NEQA&quot;). The majority reside in Kawawachikamach, Quebec, located approximately northeast of Schefferville. The village covers an area of approximately and is situated on of Category IA-N land. There is ample room for expansion, whether for residential, commercial, or industrial purposes.

The vast majority of the residents of Kawawachikamach are Naskapi. Naskapi is their principal language. It is spoken by all of them and written by many. English is their second language, although many younger persons also speak some French. The Naskapi still preserve many aspects of their traditional way of life and culture. Like many northern communities, the Naskapi rely on subsistence hunting, fishing, and trapping for a large part of their food supply and for many raw materials. Harvesting is at the heart of Naskapi spirituality.

Kawawachikamach is linked to Schefferville by a gravel-surfaced all-season road. Rail transportation is available on a weekly basis between Schefferville, Wabush and Labrador City, and Sept-Îles. The train is equipped to transport passengers and freight, including large vehicles, gasoline and fuel oil, and refrigerated goods. Schefferville, which has a paved landing strip, is connected to points south by means of year-round, five-day-per-week service.

===Mushuau Innu First Nation===
Mushuau Innu First Nation is located in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. In 1967 the Mushuau Innu were settled in &quot;Utshimassits&quot; (Davis Inlet) on Iluikoyak Island located off the coast of Labrador Peninsula, which inhibited the ability of the Mushuau Innu to continue their traditional caribou hunt on the mainland. Therefore, they were relocated in the winter of 2002/2003 to their new main settlement Natuashish (pronounced: &#x27;Nat-wah-sheesh&#x27;), about 295 km north of Happy Valley-Goose Bay and 80 km southeast of Nain. Natuashish located on the mainland is only 15 km west of &quot;Utshimassits&quot;; ethnically they are Naskapi, speaking the Eastern Dialect (Mushuau Innu or Davis Inlet variety) of Iyuw Imuun and writing in Eastern Cree syllabics, but split up and sent to Eastern Labrador, very few (if any) are able to write in syllabics any more. The majority of the people are Catholic, which use the Montagnais Bible (which does not use syllabics) and therefore use the Latin alphabet, Reservation: Natuashish #2, ca. 44 km², Population: 936)

<text>Storytelling is the social and cultural activity of sharing stories, sometimes with improvisation, theatrics or embellishment. Every culture has its own narratives, which are shared as a means of entertainment, education, cultural preservation or instilling moral values. Crucial elements of stories and storytelling include plot, characters and narrative point of view. The term &quot;storytelling&quot; can refer specifically to oral storytelling but also broadly to techniques used in other media to unfold or disclose the narrative of a story.

== Historical perspective ==
Storytelling, intertwined with the development of mythologies,
predates writing. The earliest forms of storytelling were usually oral, combined with gestures and expressions. Storytelling often has a prominent educational and performative role in religious rituals (for example, the Passover Seder), and some archaeologists believe that rock art may have served as a form of storytelling for many ancient cultures.

The Aboriginal Australian people painted symbols which also appear in stories on cave walls as a means of helping the storyteller remember the story. The story was then told using a combination of oral narrative, music, rock art and dance, which bring understanding and meaning to human existence through the remembrance and enactment of stories. People have used the carved trunks of living trees and ephemeral media (such as sand and leaves) to record folktales in pictures or with writing. Complex forms of tattooing may also represent stories, with information about genealogy, affiliation and social status.

Folktales often share common motifs and themes, suggesting possible basic psychological similarities across various human cultures. Other stories, notably fairy tales, appear to have spread from place to place, implying memetic appeal and popularity.

Groups of originally oral tales can coalesce over time into story cycles (like the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;), cluster around mythic heroes (like King Arthur), and develop into the narratives of the deeds of the gods and saints of various religions.
The results can be episodic (like the stories about Anansi), epic (as with Homeric tales), inspirational (note the tradition of &quot;vitae&quot;) and/or instructive (as in many Buddhist or Christian scriptures).

With the advent of writing and the use of stable, portable media, storytellers recorded, transcribed and continued to share stories over wide regions of the world. Stories have been carved, scratched, painted, printed or inked onto wood or bamboo, ivory and other bones, pottery, clay tablets, stone, palm-leaf books, skins (parchment), bark cloth, paper, silk, canvas and other textiles, recorded on film and stored electronically in digital form. Oral stories continue to be created, improvisationally by impromptu and professional storytellers, as well as committed to memory and passed from generation to generation, despite the increasing popularity of written and televised media in much of the world.

== Contemporary storytelling ==
Modern storytelling has a broad purview. In addition to its traditional forms (fairytales, folktales, mythology, legends, fables etc.), it has extended itself to representing history, personal narrative, political commentary and evolving cultural norms. Contemporary storytelling is also widely used to address educational objectives. New forms of media are creating new ways for people to record, express and consume stories. Tools for asynchronous group communication can provide an environment for individuals to reframe or recast individual stories into group stories. Games and other digital platforms, such as those used in interactive fiction or interactive storytelling, may be used to position the user as a character within a bigger world. Documentaries, including interactive web documentaries, employ storytelling narrative techniques to communicate information about their topic. Self-revelatory stories, created for their cathartic and therapeutic effect, are growing in their use and application, as in psychodrama, drama therapy and playback theatre. Storytelling is also used as a means by which to precipitate psychological and social change in the practice of transformative arts.

Some people also make a case for different narrative forms being classified as storytelling in the contemporary world. For example, digital storytelling, online and dice-and-paper-based role-playing games. In traditional role-playing games, storytelling is done by the person who controls the environment and the non-playing fictional characters, and moves the story elements along for the players as they interact with the storyteller. The game is advanced by mainly verbal interactions, with a dice roll determining random events in the fictional universe, where the players interact with each other and the storyteller. This type of game has many genres, such as sci-fi and fantasy, as well as alternate-reality worlds based on the current reality, but with different settings and beings such as werewolves, aliens, daemons, or hidden societies. These oral-based role-playing games were very popular in the 1990s among circles of youth in many countries before computer and console-based online MMORPG&#x27;s took their place. Despite the prevalence of computer-based MMORPGs, the dice-and-paper RPG still has a dedicated following.

== Oral traditions ==

Oral traditions of storytelling are found in several civilizations; they predate the printed and online press. Storytelling was used to explain natural phenomena, bards told stories of creation and developed a pantheon of gods and myths. Oral stories passed from one generation to the next and storytellers were regarded as healers, leaders, spiritual guides, teachers, cultural secrets keepers and entertainers. Oral storytelling came in various forms including songs, poetry, chants and dance.

Albert Bates Lord examined oral narratives from field transcripts of Yugoslav oral bards collected by Milman Parry in the 1930s, and the texts of epics such as the Odyssey. Lord found that a large part of the stories consisted of text which was improvised during the telling process.

Lord identified two types of &quot;story vocabulary.&quot; The first he called &quot;formulas&quot;: &quot;Rosy-fingered Dawn&quot;, &quot;the wine-dark sea&quot; and other specific set phrases had long been known of in Homer and other oral epics. Lord, however, discovered that across many story traditions, fully 90% of an oral epic is assembled from lines which are repeated verbatim or which use one-for-one word substitutions. In other words, oral stories are built out of set phrases which have been stockpiled from a lifetime of hearing and telling stories.

The other type of story vocabulary is theme, a set sequence of story actions that structure a tale. Just as the teller of tales proceeds line-by-line using formulas, so he proceeds from event-to-event using themes. One near-universal theme is repetition, as evidenced in Western folklore with the &quot;rule of three&quot;: Three brothers set out, three attempts are made, three riddles are asked. A theme can be as simple as a specific set sequence describing the arming of a hero, starting with shirt and trousers and ending with headdress and weapons. A theme can be large enough to be a plot component. For example: a hero proposes a journey to a dangerous place / he disguises himself / his disguise fools everybody / except for a common person of little account (a crone, a tavern maid or a woodcutter) / who immediately recognizes him / the commoner becomes the hero&#x27;s ally, showing unexpected resources of skill or initiative. A theme does not belong to a specific story, but may be found with minor variation in many different stories.

The story was described by Reynolds Price, when he wrote: A need to tell and hear stories is essential to the species &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; – second in necessity apparently after nourishment and before love and shelter. Millions survive without love or home, almost none in silence; the opposite of silence leads quickly to narrative, and the sound of story is the dominant sound of our lives, from the small accounts of our day&#x27;s events to the vast incommunicable constructs of psychopaths.In contemporary life, people will seek to fill &quot;story vacuums&quot; with oral and written stories. &quot;In the absence of a narrative, especially in an ambiguous and/or urgent situation, people will seek out and consume plausible stories like water in the desert. It is our innate nature to connect the dots. Once an explanatory narrative is adopted, it&#x27;s extremely hard to undo,&quot; whether or not it is true.

===&quot;Märchen&quot; and &quot;Sagen&quot;===
Folklorists sometimes divide oral tales into two main groups: &quot;Märchen&quot; and &quot;Sagen&quot;. These are German terms for which there are no exact English equivalents, however we have approximations:

&quot;Märchen&quot;, loosely translated as &quot;fairy tale(s)&quot; or little stories, take place in a kind of separate &quot;once-upon-a-time&quot; world of nowhere-in-particular, at an indeterminate time in the past. They are clearly not intended to be understood as true. The stories are full of clearly defined incidents, and peopled by rather flat characters with little or no interior life. When the supernatural occurs, it is presented matter-of-factly, without surprise. Indeed, there is very little effect, generally; bloodcurdling events may take place, but with little call for emotional response from the listener.

&quot;Sagen&quot;, translated as &quot;legends&quot;, are supposed to have actually happened, very often at a particular time and place, and they draw much of their power from this fact. When the supernatural intrudes (as it often does), it does so in an emotionally fraught manner. Ghost and Lovers&#x27; Leap stories belong in this category, as do many UFO stories and stories of supernatural beings and events.

Another important examination of orality in human life is Walter J. Ong&#x27;s &quot;Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word&quot; (1982). Ong studies the distinguishing characteristics of oral traditions, how oral and written cultures interact and condition one another, and how they ultimately influence human epistemology.

== Learning ==
Storytelling is a means for sharing and interpreting experiences. Peter L. Berger says human life is narratively rooted, humans construct their lives and shape their world into homes in terms of these groundings and memories. Stories are universal in that they can bridge cultural, linguistic and age-related divides. Storytelling can be adaptive for all ages, leaving out the notion of age segregation. Storytelling can be used as a method to teach ethics, values and cultural norms and differences. Learning is most effective when it takes place in social environments that provide authentic social cues about how knowledge is to be applied. Stories function as a tool to pass on knowledge in a social context. So, every story has 3 parts. First, The setup (The Hero&#x27;s world before the adventure starts). Second, The Confrontation (The hero&#x27;s world turned upside down). Third, The Resolution (Hero conquers villain, but it is not enough for Hero to survive. The Hero or World must be transformed). Any story can be framed in such format.

Human knowledge is based on stories and the human brain consists of cognitive machinery necessary to understand, remember and tell stories. Humans are storytelling organisms that both individually and socially, lead storied lives. Stories mirror human thought as humans think in narrative structures and most often remember facts in story form. Facts can be understood as smaller versions of a larger story, thus storytelling can supplement analytical thinking. Because storytelling requires auditory and visual senses from listeners, one can learn to organize their mental representation of a story, recognize structure of language and express his or her thoughts.

Stories tend to be based on experiential learning, but learning from an experience is not automatic. Often a person needs to attempt to tell the story of that experience before realizing its value. In this case, it is not only the listener who learns, but the teller who also becomes aware of his or her own unique experiences and background. This process of storytelling is empowering as the teller effectively conveys ideas and, with practice, is able to demonstrate the potential of human accomplishment. Storytelling taps into existing knowledge and creates bridges both culturally and motivationally toward a solution.

Stories are effective educational tools because listeners become engaged and therefore remember. Storytelling can be seen as a foundation for learning and teaching. While the story listener is engaged, they are able to imagine new perspectives, inviting a transformative and empathetic experience. This involves allowing the individual to actively engage in the story as well as observe, listen and participate with minimal guidance. Listening to a storyteller can create lasting personal connections, promote innovative problem solving and foster a shared understanding regarding future ambitions. The listener can then activate knowledge and imagine new possibilities. Together a storyteller and listener can seek best practices and invent new solutions. Because stories often have multiple layers of meanings, listeners have to listen closely to identify the underlying knowledge in the story. Storytelling is used as a tool to teach children the importance of respect through the practice of listening. As well as connecting children with their environment, through the theme of the stories, and give them more autonomy by using repetitive statements, which improve their learning to learn competence. It is also used to teach children to have respect for all life, value inter-connectedness and always work to overcome adversity. To teach this a Kinesthetic learning style would be used, involving the listeners through music, dream interpretation, or dance.

=== In indigenous cultures ===


For indigenous cultures of the Americas, storytelling is used as an oral form of language associated with practices and values essential to developing one&#x27;s identity. This is because everyone in the community can add their own touch and perspective to the narrative collaboratively – both individual and culturally shared perspectives have a place in the co-creation of the story. Oral storytelling in indigenous communities differs from other forms of stories because they are told not only for entertainment, but for teaching values. For example, the community in Canada focuses on reinforcing children&#x27;s identity by telling stories about the land to explain their roles. 

Furthermore, Storytelling is a way to teach younger members of indigenous communities about their culture and their identities. In Donna Eder&#x27;s study, Navajos were interviewed about storytelling practices that they have had in the past and what changes they want to see in the future. They notice that storytelling makes an impact on the lives of the children of the Navajos. According to some of the Navajos that were interviewed, storytelling is one of many main practices that teaches children the important principles to live a good life. In indigenous communities, stories are a way to pass knowledge on from generation to generation.

For some indigenous people, experience has no separation between the physical world and the spiritual world. Thus, some indigenous people communicate to their children through ritual, storytelling, or dialogue. Community values, learned through storytelling, help to guide future generations and aid in identity formation.

In the Quechua community of Highland Peru, there is no separation between adults and children. This allows for children to learn storytelling through their own interpretations of the given story. Therefore, children in the Quechua community are encouraged to listen to the story that is being told in order to learn about their identity and culture. Sometimes, children are expected to sit quietly and listen actively. This enables them to engage in activities as independent learners.

This teaching practice of storytelling allowed children to formulate ideas based on their own experiences and perspectives. In Navajo communities, for children and adults, storytelling is one of the many effective ways to educate both the young and old about their cultures, identities and history. Storytelling help the Navajos know who they are, where they come from and where they belong.

Storytelling in indigenous cultures is sometimes passed on by oral means in a quiet and relaxing environment, which usually coincides with family or tribal community gatherings and official events such as family occasions, rituals, or ceremonial practices. During the telling of the story, children may act as participants by asking questions, acting out the story, or telling smaller parts of the story. Furthermore, stories are not often told in the same manner twice, resulting in many variations of a single myth. This is because narrators may choose to insert new elements into old stories dependent upon the relationship between the storyteller and the audience, making the story correspond to each unique situation.

Indigenous cultures also use instructional ribbing— a playful form of correcting children&#x27;s undesirable behavior— in their stories. For example, the Ojibwe (or Chippewa) tribe uses the tale of an owl snatching away misbehaving children. The caregiver will often say, &quot;The owl will come and stick you in his ears if you don&#x27;t stop crying!&quot; Thus, this form of teasing serves as a tool to correct inappropriate behavior and promote cooperation.

==== Types ====
There are various types of stories among many indigenous communities. Communication in Indigenous American communities is rich with stories, myths, philosophies and narratives that serve as a means to exchange information. These stories may be used for coming of age themes, core values, morality, literacy and history. Very often, the stories are used to instruct and teach children about cultural values and lessons. The meaning within the stories is not always explicit, and children are expected to make their own meaning of the stories. In the Lakota Tribe of North America, for example, young girls are often told the story of the White Buffalo Calf Woman, who is a spiritual figure that protects young girls from the whims of men. In the Odawa Tribe, young boys are often told the story of a young man who never took care of his body, and as a result, his feet fail to run when he tries to escape predators. This story serves as an indirect means of encouraging the young boys to take care of their bodies.

Narratives can be shared to express the values or morals among family, relatives, or people who are considered part of the close-knit community. Many stories in indigenous American communities all have a &quot;surface&quot; story, that entails knowing certain information and clues to unlocking the metaphors in the story. The underlying message of the story being told, can be understood and interpreted with clues that hint to a certain interpretation. In order to make meaning from these stories, elders in the community for example, emphasize the importance in learning how to listen, since it requires the senses to bring one&#x27;s heart and mind together. For instance, a way in which children learn about the metaphors significant for the society they live in, is by listening to their elders and participating in rituals where they respect one another.

==== Passing on values ====
Stories in indigenous cultures encompass a variety of values. These values include an emphasis on individual responsibility, concern for the environment and communal welfare.

Stories are based on values passed down by older generations to shape the foundation of the community. Storytelling is used as a bridge for knowledge and understanding allowing the values of &quot;self&quot; and &quot;community&quot; to connect and be learned as a whole. Storytelling in the Navajo community for example allows for community values to be learned at different times and places for different learners. Stories are told from the perspective of other people, animals, or the natural elements of the earth. In this way, children learn to value their place in the world as a person in relation to others. Typically, stories are used as an informal learning tool in Indigenous American communities, and can act as an alternative method for reprimanding children&#x27;s bad behavior. In this way, stories are non-confrontational, which allows the child to discover for themselves what they did wrong and what they can do to adjust the behavior.

Parents in the Arizona Tewa community, for example, teach morals to their children through traditional narratives. Lessons focus on several topics including historical or &quot;sacred&quot; stories or more domestic disputes. Through storytelling, the Tewa community emphasizes the traditional wisdom of the ancestors and the importance of collective as well as individual identities. Indigenous communities teach children valuable skills and morals through the actions of good or mischievous stock characters while also allowing room for children to make meaning for themselves. By not being given every element of the story, children rely on their own experiences and not formal teaching from adults to fill in the gaps.

When children listen to stories, they periodically vocalize their ongoing attention and accept the extended turn of the storyteller. The emphasis on attentiveness to surrounding events and the importance of oral tradition in indigenous communities teaches children the skill of keen attention. For example, Children of the Tohono O&#x27;odham American Indian community who engaged in more cultural practices were able to recall the events in a verbally presented story better than those who did not engage in cultural practices. Body movements and gestures help to communicate values and keep stories alive for future generations. Elders, parents and grandparents are typically involved in teaching the children the cultural ways, along with history, community values and teachings of the land.

Children in indigenous communities can also learn from the underlying message of a story. For example, in a nahuatl community near Mexico City, stories about ahuaques or hostile water dwelling spirits that guard over the bodies of water, contain morals about respecting the environment. If the protagonist of a story, who has accidentally broken something that belongs to the ahuaque, does not replace it or give back in some way to the ahuaque, the protagonist dies. In this way, storytelling serves as a way to teach what the community values, such as valuing the environment.

Storytelling also serves to deliver a particular message during spiritual and ceremonial functions. In the ceremonial use of storytelling, the unity building theme of the message becomes more important than the time, place and characters of the message. Once the message is delivered, the story is finished. As cycles of the tale are told and retold, story units can recombine, showing various outcomes for a person&#x27;s actions.

== Research ==
Storytelling has been assessed for critical literacy skills and the learning of theatre-related terms by the nationally recognized storytelling and creative drama organization, Neighborhood Bridges, in Minneapolis. Another storyteller researcher in the UK proposes that the social space created preceding oral storytelling in schools may trigger sharing (Parfitt, 2014).

Storytelling has also been studied as a way to investigate and archive cultural knowledge and values within indigenous American communities. Iseke&#x27;s study (2013) on the role of storytelling in the Metis community, showed promise in furthering research about the Metis and their shared communal atmosphere during storytelling events. Iseke focused on the idea of witnessing a storyteller as a vital way to share and partake in the Metis community, as members of the community would stop everything else they were doing in order to listen or &quot;witness&quot; the storyteller and allow the story to become a &quot;ceremonial landscape&quot;, or shared reference, for everyone present. This was a powerful tool for the community to engage and teach new learner shared references for the values and ideologies of the Metis. Through storytelling, the Metis cemented the shared reference of personal or popular stories and folklore, which members of the community can use to share ideologies. In the future, Iseke noted that Metis elders wished for the stories being told to be used for further research into their culture, as stories were a traditional way to pass down vital knowledge to younger generations.

For the stories we read, the &quot;neuro-semantic encoding of narratives happens at levels higher than individual semantic units and that this encoding is systematic across both individuals and languages.&quot; This encoding seems to appear most prominently in the default mode network.

== Serious storytelling ==
Storytelling in serious application contexts, as e.g. therapeutics, business, serious games, medicine, education, or faith can be referred to as serious storytelling. Serious storytelling applies storytelling &quot;outside the context of entertainment, where the narration progresses as a sequence of patterns impressive in quality ... and is part of a thoughtful progress&quot;.

== As a political praxis ==
Some approaches treat narratives as politically motivated stories, stories empowering certain groups and stories giving people agency. Instead of just searching for the main point of the narrative, the political function is demanded through asking, &quot;Whose interest does a personal narrative serve&quot;? This approach mainly looks at the power, authority, knowledge, ideology and identity; &quot;whether it legitimates and dominates or resists and empowers&quot;. All personal narratives are seen as ideological because they evolve from a structure of power relations and simultaneously produce, maintain and reproduce that power structure&quot;.

Political theorist, Hannah Arendt argues that storytelling transforms private meaning to public meaning. Regardless of the gender of the narrator and what story they are sharing, the performance of the narrative and the audience listening to it is where the power lies.

== Therapeutic ==
Therapeutic storytelling is the act of telling one&#x27;s story in an attempt to better understand oneself or one&#x27;s situation. Oftentimes, these stories affect the audience in a therapeutic sense as well, helping them to view situations similar to their own through a different lens. Noted author and folklore scholar, Elaine Lawless states, &quot;...this process provides new avenues for understanding and identity formation. Language is utilised to bear witness to their lives&quot;. Sometimes a narrator will simply skip over certain details without realizing, only to include it in their stories during a later telling. In this way, that telling and retelling of the narrative serves to &quot;reattach portions of the narrative&quot;. These gaps may occur due to a repression of the trauma or even just a want to keep the most gruesome details private. Regardless, these silences are not as empty as they appear, and it is only this act of storytelling that can enable the teller to fill them back in.

Psychodrama uses re-enactment of a personal, traumatic event in the life of a psychodrama group participant as a therapeutic methodology, first developed by psychiatrist, J.L. Moreno, M.D. This therapeutic use of storytelling was incorporated into Drama Therapy, known in the field as &quot;Self Revelatory Theater&quot;. In 1975 Jonathan Fox and Jo Salas developed a therapeutic, improvisational storytelling form they called Playback Theatre. Therapeutic storytelling is also used to promote healing through transformative arts, where a facilitator helps a participant write and often present their personal story to an audience.

== As art form ==

=== Aesthetics ===
The art of narrative is, by definition, an aesthetic enterprise, and there are a number of artistic elements that typically interact in well-developed stories. Such elements include the essential idea of narrative structure with identifiable beginnings, middles, and endings, or exposition-development-climax-resolution-denouement, normally constructed into coherent plot lines; a strong focus on temporality, which includes retention of the past, attention to present action and protention/future anticipation; a substantial focus on characters and characterization which is &quot;arguably the most important single component of the novel&quot;; a given heterogloss of different voices dialogically at play – &quot;the sound of the human voice, or many voices, speaking in a variety of accents, rhythms and registers&quot;; possesses a narrator or narrator-like voice, which by definition &quot;addresses&quot; and &quot;interacts with&quot; reading audiences (see Reader Response theory); communicates with a Wayne Booth-esque rhetorical thrust, a dialectic process of interpretation, which is at times beneath the surface, conditioning a plotted narrative, and at other times much more visible, &quot;arguing&quot; for and against various positions; relies substantially on now-standard aesthetic figuration, particularly including the use of metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche and irony (see Hayden White, &quot;&quot; for expansion of this idea); is often enmeshed in intertextuality, with copious connections, references, allusions, similarities, parallels, etc. to other literatures; and commonly demonstrates an effort toward &quot;bildungsroman&quot;, a description of identity development with an effort to evince &quot;becoming&quot; in character and community.

=== Festivals ===
Storytelling festivals typically feature the work of several storytellers and may include workshops for tellers and others who are interested in the art form or other targeted applications of storytelling. Elements of the oral storytelling art form often include the tellers encouragement to have participants co-create an experience by connecting to relatable elements of the story and using techniques of visualization (the seeing of images in the mind&#x27;s eye), and use vocal and bodily gestures to support understanding. In many ways, the art of storytelling draws upon other art forms such as acting, oral interpretation and Performance Studies.

In 1903, Richard Wyche, a professor of literature at the University of Tennessee created the first organized storytellers league of its kind. It was called The National Story League. Wyche served as its president for 16 years, facilitated storytelling classes, and spurred an interest in the art.

Several other storytelling organizations started in the U.S. during the 1970s. One such organization was the National Association for the Perpetuation and Preservation of Storytelling (NAPPS), now the National Storytelling Network (NSN) and the International Storytelling Center (ISC). NSN is a professional organization that helps to organize resources for tellers and festival planners. The ISC runs the National Storytelling Festival in Jonesborough, TN. Australia followed their American counterparts with the establishment of storytelling guilds in the late 1970s. Australian storytelling today has individuals and groups across the country who meet to share their stories. The UK&#x27;s Society for Storytelling was founded in 1993, bringing together tellers and listeners, and each year since 2000 has run a National Storytelling Week the first week of February.

Currently, there are dozens of storytelling festivals and hundreds of professional storytellers around the world, and an international celebration of the art occurs on World Storytelling Day.

== Emancipation of the story ==

In oral traditions, stories are kept alive by being told again and again. The material of any given story naturally undergoes several changes and s during this process. When and where oral tradition was superseded by print media, the literary idea of the author as originator of a story&#x27;s authoritative version changed people&#x27;s perception of stories themselves. In centuries following, stories tended to be seen as the work of individuals rather than a collective effort. Only recently when a significant number of influential authors began questioning their own roles, the value of stories as such – independent of authorship – was again recognized. Literary critics such as Roland Barthes even proclaimed the Death of the Author.

== In business ==
People have been telling stories at work since ancient times, when stories might inspire &quot;courage and empowerment during the hunt for a potentially dangerous animal,&quot; or simply instill the value of listening. Storytelling in business has become a field in its own right as industries have grown, as storytelling becomes a more popular art form in general through live storytelling events like The Moth.

=== Recruiting ===
Storytelling has come to have a prominent role in recruiting. The modern recruiting industry started in the 1940s as employers competed for available labor during World War II. Prior to that, employers usually placed newspaper ads telling a story about the kind of person they wanted, including their character and, in many cases, their ethnicity.

=== Public relations ===
Public influence has been part of human civilization since ancient times, but the modern public relations industry traces its roots to a Boston-based PR firm called The Publicity Bureau that opened in 1900. Although a PR firm may not identify its role as storytelling, the firm&#x27;s task is to control the public narrative about the organization they represent.

=== Networking ===
Networking has been around since the industrial revolution when businesses recognized the need—and the benefit—of collaborating and trusting a wider range of people. Today, networking is the subject for more than 100,000 books, seminars and online conversations.

Storytelling helps networkers showcase their expertise. &quot;Using examples and stories to teach contacts about expertise, experience, talents, and interests&quot; is one of eight networking competencies the Association for Talent Development has identified, saying that networkers should &quot;be able to answer the question, &#x27;What do you do?&#x27; to make expertise visible and memorable.&quot; Business storytelling begins by considering the needs of the audience the networker wishes to reach, asking, &quot;What is it about what I do that my audience is most interested in?&quot; and &quot;What would intrigue them the most?&quot;

=== Within the workplace ===

In the workplace, communicating by using storytelling techniques can be a more compelling and effective route of delivering information than that of using only dry facts. Uses include:

==== To manage conflicts ====

For managers storytelling is an important way of resolving conflicts, addressing issues and facing challenges.
Managers may use narrative discourse to deal with conflicts when direct action is inadvisable or impossible.

==== To interpret the past and shape the future ====

In a group discussion a process of collective narration can help to influence others and unify the group by linking the past to the future.
In such discussions, managers transform problems, requests and issues into stories. Jameson calls this collective group construction story building.

==== In the reasoning process ====

Storytelling plays an important role in reasoning processes and in convincing others.
In business meetings, managers and business officials preferred stories to abstract arguments or statistical measures. When situations are complex or dense, narrative discourse helps to resolve conflicts, influences corporate decisions and stabilizes the group.

=== In marketing ===
Storytelling is increasingly being used in advertising in order to build customer loyalty. According to Giles Lury, this marketing trend echoes the deeply rooted human need to be entertained. Stories are illustrative, easily memorable and allow companies to create stronger emotional bonds with customers.

A Nielsen study shows consumers want a more personal connection in the way they gather information since human brains are more engaged by storytelling than by the presentation of facts alone. When reading pure data, only the language parts of the brain work to decode the meaning. But when reading a story, both the language parts and those parts of the brain that would be engaged if the events of the story were actually experienced are activated. As a result, it is easier to remember stories than facts.

Marketing developments incorporating storytelling include the use of the trans-media techniques that originated in the film industry intended to &quot;build a world in which your story can evolve&quot;. Examples include the &quot;Happiness Factory&quot; of Coca-Cola.

<doc id="81451" wikidata="Q1315458" url="?curid=81451" title="Orgel's rules">
<text>Orgel&#x27;s rules are a set of axioms attributed by Francis Crick to the evolutionary biologist Leslie Orgel.

==Orgel&#x27;s First Rule==
&quot;Whenever a spontaneous process is too slow or too inefficient a protein will evolve to speed it up or make it more efficient.&quot;

This &quot;rule&quot; comments on the fact that there are a great number of proteins in all organisms which fulfil a number of different functions through modifying chemical or physical processes. An example would be an enzyme that catalyses a chemical reaction that would take place too slowly to benefit an organism without being sped up by this enzyme.

==Orgel&#x27;s Second Rule==
&quot;Evolution is cleverer than you are.&quot;

This rule is well known among biologists. It does not imply that evolution has conscious motives or method but that people who say &quot;evolution can&#x27;t do this&quot; or &quot;evolution can&#x27;t do that&quot; are simply lacking in imagination.

Orgel&#x27;s second rule tells us that the process of natural selection is not itself intelligent, clever or purposeful but that the products of evolution are ingenious.

<doc id="81453" wikidata="Q1229001" url="?curid=81453" title="Kahuna">
<text>Kahuna (; ) is a Hawaiian word that refers to an expert in any field. Historically, it has been used to refer to doctors, surgeons and dentists, as well as priests, ministers, and sorcerers.

== Background ==
A may be versed in agriculture, canoe building, or any other skill or knowledge area. They may be called on by the community to bless new buildings and construction projects or to officiate weddings.

Forty types of are listed in the book &quot;Tales from the Night Rainbow&quot;, twenty in the healing professions alone, including , a medical priest or practitioner, and , &quot;an expert who diagnoses, as sickness or pain, by feeling the body&quot;.

There are several categories of . A &quot;craft kahuna&quot;, such as the is an expert canoe maker, and a is an expert navigator. A is a &quot;medical doctor, medical practitioner, [or] healer. &quot;.

=== &quot;Kahuna nui&quot; ===
According to Fornander, there are ten colleges or branches of the Hawaiian priesthood:

* , , and were said to practice sorcery, to bring death or injury to others by means of prayer.
* and were said to use spirits for divination and spirit possession.
* : one who practices medicinal healing.
* (): one who locates the site for the construction of , or temples.
* : one who divines and predicts future events, a prophet.
* : soothsayers, diviners, prophets.

To master all ten branches made one a or high priest. usually lived in places such as Waimea Valley, which is known as the Valley of the Priests. They were given slices of land that spanned from the mountain to the sea. Hewahewa, a direct descendant of Paao, was a to Kamehameha I. A contemporary, Leimomi Mookini Lum is a . David Kaonohiokala Bray was a well-known .

King Kamehameha IV, in his translation of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, used the term to refer to Anglican priests, and to refer to both lay and ordained Anglican ministers.

== Legal status ==
Craft were never prohibited; however, during the decline of native Hawaiian culture, many died and did not pass on their wisdom to new students. As an example, when the was built to be sailed to the South Pacific to prove the voyaging capabilities of the ancient Hawaiians, master navigator Mau Piailug from Satawal was brought to Hawaii to reteach navigation to the Hawaiians.

After American missionaries went to Hawaii in 1820, they reportedly prohibited practices. But, in the 100 years after the missionaries arrived, all practices were legal until 1831, some were illegal until 1863, all were legal until 1887, and some were illegal until 1919. Since 1919 all have been legal except sorcery, which was initially declared illegal but was decriminalized in 1972.

The first Christian missionaries arrived in 1820. Kaahumanu, one of the most powerful people in the Hawaiian nation, did not convert until 1825. Eleven years after missionaries arrived, she proclaimed laws against hula, chant, kava, and Hawaiian religion.

== Non-Hawaiian uses ==
The term was used in the 1959 film &quot;Gidget&quot;, in which &quot;The Big Kahuna&quot;, played by Cliff Robertson (Martin Milner in the TV episode), was the leader of a group of surfers. The figure of the &quot;Big Kahuna&quot; became commonplace in Beach party films of the 1960s, such as &quot;Beach Blanket Bingo&quot;, in which the &quot;Big Kahuna&quot; was the best surfer on the beach. Hawaiian surfing master Duke Kahanamoku may have been referred to as the &quot;Big Kahuna&quot;, but he rejected the term as he knew the original meaning.

In the New Age spiritual system known as Huna, which uses some Hawaiian words and concepts appropriated from Hawaiian tradition, &quot;kahuna&quot; denotes someone of priestly or shamanic standing. The prevalence of these works in pop culture has influenced definitions in English dictionaries, such as Merriam-Webster, which not only defines &quot;kahuna&quot; as &quot;a preeminent person or thing&quot; but also offers &quot;Hawaiian shaman&quot; as a secondary definition. Wells College professor Lisa Kahaleole Hall, a Native Hawaiian, wrote in a peer-reviewed journal published by the University of Hawaiʻi that Huna &quot;bears absolutely no resemblance to any Hawaiian worldview or spiritual practice&quot; and calls it part of the &quot;New Age spiritual industry.&quot;

<doc id="81455" wikidata="Q297308" url="?curid=81455" title="William H. Seward">
<text>William Henry Seward (; May 16, 1801 – October 10, 1872) was an American politician who served as United States Secretary of State from 1861 to 1869, and earlier served as governor of New York and as a United States senator. A determined opponent of the spread of slavery in the years leading up to the American Civil War, he was a prominent figure in the Republican Party in its formative years, and was praised for his work on behalf of the Union as Secretary of State during the Civil War. He also negotiated the treaty for the United States to purchase the Alaska Territory.

Seward was born in 1801 in the village of Florida, in Orange County, New York, where his father was a farmer and owned slaves. He was educated as a lawyer and moved to the Central New York town of Auburn. Seward was elected to the New York State Senate in 1830 as an Anti-Mason. Four years later, he became the gubernatorial nominee of the Whig Party. Though he was not successful in that race, Seward was elected governor in 1838 and won a second two-year term in 1840. During this period, he signed several laws that advanced the rights of and opportunities for black residents, as well as guaranteeing jury trials for fugitive slaves in the state. The legislation protected abolitionists, and he used his position to intervene in cases of freed black people who were enslaved in the South.

After many years of practicing law in Auburn, he was elected by the state legislature to the U.S. Senate in 1849. Seward&#x27;s strong stances and provocative words against slavery brought him hatred in the South. He was re-elected to the Senate in 1855, and soon joined the nascent Republican Party, becoming one of its leading figures. As the 1860 presidential election approached, he was regarded as the leading candidate for the Republican nomination. Several factors, including attitudes to his vocal opposition to slavery, his support for immigrants and Catholics, and his association with editor and political boss Thurlow Weed, worked against him, and Abraham Lincoln secured the presidential nomination. Although devastated by his loss, he campaigned for Lincoln, who appointed him Secretary of State after winning the election.

Seward did his best to stop the southern states from seceding; once that failed, he devoted himself wholeheartedly to the Union cause. His firm stance against foreign intervention in the Civil War helped deter the United Kingdom and France from recognizing the independence of the Confederate States. He was one of the targets of the 1865 assassination plot that killed Lincoln and was seriously wounded by conspirator Lewis Powell. Seward remained in his post through the presidency of Andrew Johnson, during which he negotiated the Alaska Purchase in 1867 and supported Johnson during his impeachment. His contemporary Carl Schurz described Seward as &quot;one of those spirits who sometimes will go ahead of public opinion instead of tamely following its footprints&quot;.

==Early life==
Seward was born on May 16, 1801, in the small community of Florida, New York, in Orange County. He was the fourth son of Samuel Sweezy Seward and his wife Mary (Jennings) Seward. Samuel Seward was a wealthy landowner and slaveholder in New York State; slavery was not fully abolished in the state until 1827. Florida, located some north of New York City and west of the Hudson River, was a small rural village of perhaps a dozen homes. Young Seward attended school there, and also in the nearby county seat of Goshen. He was a bright student who enjoyed his studies. In later years, one of the former family slaves would relate that instead of running away from school to go home, Seward would run away from home to go to school.

At the age of 15, Henry—he was known by his middle name as a boy—was sent to Union College in Schenectady, New York. Admitted to the sophomore class, Seward was an outstanding student and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Seward&#x27;s fellow students included Richard M. Blatchford, who became a lifelong legal and political associate. Samuel Seward kept his son short on cash, and in December 1818—during the middle of Henry&#x27;s final year at Union—the two quarreled about money. The younger Seward returned to Schenectady but soon left school in company with a fellow student, Alvah Wilson. The two took a ship from New York to Georgia, where Wilson had been offered a job as rector, or principal, of a new academy in rural Putnam County. En route, Wilson took a job at another school, leaving Seward to continue on to Eatonton in Putnam County. The trustees interviewed the 17-year-old Seward and found his qualifications acceptable.

Seward enjoyed his time in Georgia, where he was accepted as an adult for the first time. He was treated hospitably but also witnessed the ill-treatment of slaves. Seward was persuaded to return to New York by his family and did so in June 1819. As it was too late for him to graduate with his class, he studied law at an attorney&#x27;s office in Goshen before returning to Union College, securing his degree with highest honors in June 1820.

==Lawyer and state senator==

===Early career and involvement in politics===
After graduation, Seward spent much of the following two years studying law in Goshen and New York City with attorneys John Duer, John Anthon and Ogden Hoffman. He passed the bar examination in late 1822. He could have practiced in Goshen, but he disliked the town and sought a practice in growing Western New York. Seward decided upon Auburn in Cayuga County, which was about west of Albany and northwest of Goshen. He joined the practice of retired judge Elijah Miller, whose daughter Frances Adeline Miller was a classmate of his sister Cornelia at Emma Willard&#x27;s Troy Female Seminary. Seward married Frances Miller on October 20, 1824.

In 1824, Seward was journeying with his wife to Niagara Falls when one of the wheels on his carriage was damaged while they passed through Rochester. Among those who came to their aid was local newspaper publisher Thurlow Weed. Seward and Weed would become closer in the years ahead as they found they shared a belief that government policies should promote infrastructure improvements, such as roads and canals. Weed, deemed by some to be one of the earliest political bosses, would become a major ally of Seward. Despite the benefits to Seward&#x27;s career from Weed&#x27;s support, perceptions that Seward was too much controlled by Weed became a factor in the former&#x27;s defeat for the Republican nomination for president in 1860.

Almost from the time he settled in Auburn, Seward involved himself in politics. At that time, the political system was in flux as new parties evolved. In New York State, there were generally two factions, which went by varying names, but were characterized by the fact that Martin Van Buren led one element, and the other opposed him. Van Buren, over a quarter century, held a series of senior posts, generally in the federal government. His allies were dubbed the Albany Regency, as they governed for Van Buren while he was away.

Seward originally supported the Regency, but by 1824 had broken from it, concluding that it was corrupt. He became part of the Anti-Masonic Party, which became widespread in 1826 after the disappearance and death of William Morgan, a Mason in Upstate New York; he was most likely killed by fellow Masons for publishing a book revealing the order&#x27;s secret rites. Since the leading candidate in opposition to President John Quincy Adams was General Andrew Jackson, a Mason who mocked opponents of the order, Anti-Masonry became closely associated with opposition to Jackson, and to his policies once he was elected president in 1828.

Governor DeWitt Clinton had nominated Seward as Cayuga County Surrogate in late 1827 or early 1828, but as Seward was unwilling to support Jackson, he was not confirmed by the state Senate. During the 1828 campaign, Seward made speeches in support of President Adams&#x27;s re-election. Seward was nominated for the federal House of Representatives by the Anti-Masons, but withdrew, deeming the fight hopeless. In 1829, Seward was offered the local nomination for New York State Assembly, but again felt there was no prospect of winning. In 1830, with Weed&#x27;s aid, he gained the Anti-Masonic nomination for state senator for the local district. Seward had appeared in court throughout the district, and had spoken in favor of government support for infrastructure improvements, a position popular there. Weed had moved his operations to Albany, where his newspaper, the &quot;Albany Evening Journal&quot;, advocated for Seward, who was elected by about 2,000 votes.

===State senator and gubernatorial candidate===
Seward was sworn in as state senator in January 1831. He left Frances and their children in Auburn and wrote to her of his experiences. These included meeting former vice president Aaron Burr, who had returned to practicing law in New York following a self-imposed exile in Europe after his duel with Alexander Hamilton and treason trial. The Regency (or the Democrats, as the national party led by Jackson and supported by Van Buren, was becoming known) controlled the Senate. Seward and his party allied with dissident Democrats and others to pass some legislation, including penal reform measures, for which Seward would become known.

During his term as state senator, Seward traveled extensively, visiting other anti-Jackson leaders, including former president Adams. He also accompanied his father Samuel Seward on a trip to Europe, where they met the political men of the day. Seward hoped that the Anti-Masons would nominate Supreme Court Justice John McLean for president against Jackson&#x27;s re-election bid in 1832, but the nomination fell to former Attorney General William Wirt. Kentucky Senator Henry Clay, an opponent of Jackson, was a Mason, and thus unacceptable as party standard-bearer. In the aftermath of Jackson&#x27;s easy victory, many of those who opposed him believed that a united front was necessary to defeat the Democrats, and the Whig Party gradually came into being. The Whigs believed in legislative action to develop the country and opposed Jackson&#x27;s unilateral actions as president, which they deemed imperial. Many Anti-Masons, including Seward and Weed, readily joined the new party.

In preparation for the 1834 election, New York&#x27;s Whigs met in Utica to determine a gubernatorial candidate. Democratic Governor William Marcy was heavily favored to be re-elected, and few prominent Whigs were anxious to run a campaign that would most likely be lost. Seward&#x27;s wife and father wanted him to retire from politics to increase the income from his law practice, and Weed urged him to seek re-election to the state Senate. Nevertheless, the reluctance of others to run caused Seward to emerge as a major candidate. Weed procured Seward&#x27;s triumph at the Utica convention. The election turned on national issues, most importantly President Jackson&#x27;s policies. These were then popular, and in a strong year for Democrats, Seward was defeated by some 11,000 votes—Weed wrote that the Whigs were overwhelmed by illegally cast ballots.

Defeated for governor and with his term in the state Senate having expired, Seward returned to Auburn and the practice of law at the start of 1835. That year, Seward and his wife undertook a lengthy trip, going as far south as Virginia. Although they were hospitably received by southerners, the Sewards saw scenes of slavery which confirmed them as its opponents. The following year, Seward accepted a position as agent for the new owners of the Holland Land Company, which owned large tracts of land in Western New York, upon which many settlers were purchasing real estate on installment. The new owners were viewed as less forgiving landlords than the old, and when there was unrest, they hired Seward, popular in Western New York, in hopes of adjusting the matter. He was successful, and when the Panic of 1837 began, persuaded the owners to avoid foreclosures where possible. He also, in 1838, arranged the purchase of the company&#x27;s holdings by a consortium that included himself.

Van Buren had been elected president in 1836; even with his other activities, Seward had found time to campaign against him. The economic crisis came soon after the inauguration and threatened the Regency&#x27;s control of New York politics. Seward had not run for governor in 1836, but with the Democrats unpopular, saw a path to victory in 1838 (the term was then two years). Other prominent Whigs also sought the nomination. Weed persuaded delegates to the convention that Seward had run ahead of other Whig candidates in 1834; Seward was nominated on the fourth ballot. Seward&#x27;s opponent was again Marcy, and the economy the principal issue. The Whigs argued that the Democrats were responsible for the recession. As it was thought improper for candidates for major office to campaign in person, Seward left most of that to Weed. Seward was elected by a margin of about 10,000 votes out of 400,000 cast. The victory was the most significant for the Whig Party to that point, and eliminated the Regency from power in New York, permanently.

==Governor of New York==

William Seward was sworn in as governor of New York on January 1, 1839, and inaugurated in front of a crowd of jubilant Whigs. In that era, the annual message by the New York governor was published and discussed to the extent of that of a president. Seward biographer Walter Stahr wrote that his address &quot;brimmed with his youth, energy, ambition, and optimism&quot;. Seward took note of America&#x27;s great unexploited resources and stated that immigration should be encouraged in order to take advantage of them. He urged that citizenship and religious liberty be granted to those who came to New York&#x27;s shores. At the time, New York City&#x27;s public schools were run by Protestants, and used Protestant texts, including the King James Bible. Seward believed the current system was a barrier to literacy for the children of Catholic immigrants and proposed legislation to change it. Education, he stated, &quot;banishes the distinctions, old as time, of rich and poor, master and slave. It banishes ignorance and lays axe to the root of crime&quot;. Seward&#x27;s stance was popular among Catholic immigrants, but was disliked by nativists; their opposition would eventually help defeat his bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 1860.

Although the Assembly had a Whig majority at the start of Seward&#x27;s first term as governor, the party had only 13 legislators out of 32 in the state Senate. The Democrats refused to cooperate with Governor Seward except on the most urgent matters, and he initially found himself unable to advance much of his agenda. Accordingly, the 1839 legislative elections were crucial to Seward&#x27;s legislative hopes, and to advancing the nominations of many Whigs to state office whose posts required Senate confirmation. Both Seward and President Van Buren gave several speeches across New York State that summer. Henry Clay, one of the hopefuls for the Whig nomination for president, spent part of the summer in Upstate New York, and the two men met by chance on a ferry. Seward refused to formally visit Clay at his vacation home in Saratoga Springs in the interests of neutrality, beginning a difficult relationship between the two men. After the 1839 election, the Whigs had 19 seats, allowing the party full control of state government.

Following the election, there was unrest near Albany among tenant farmers on the land owned by Dutch-descended patroons of the van Rensselaer family. These tenancies allowed the landlords privileges such as enlisting the unpaid labor of tenants, and any breach could result in termination of tenure without compensation for improvements. When sheriff&#x27;s deputies in Albany County were obstructed from serving eviction writs, Seward was asked to call out the militia. After an all-night cabinet meeting, he did so, though quietly assuring the tenants that he would intervene with the legislature. This mollified the settlers, though Seward proved unable to get the legislature to pass reforming laws. This question of tenants&#x27; rights was not settled until after Seward had left office.

In September 1839, a ship sailing from Norfolk, Virginia, to New York City was discovered to have an escaped slave on board. The slave was returned to his owner pursuant to the Fugitive Slave Clause of the Constitution, but Virginia also demanded that three free black sailors, said to have concealed the fugitive aboard ship, be surrendered to its custody. This Seward would not do, and the Virginia General Assembly passed legislation inhibiting trade with New York. With Seward&#x27;s encouragement, the New York legislature passed acts in 1840 protecting the rights of blacks against Southern slave-catchers. One guaranteed alleged fugitive slaves the right of a jury trial in New York to establish whether they were slaves, and another pledged the aid of the state to recover free blacks kidnapped into slavery.

Seward and Van Buren were both up for re-election in 1840. Seward did not attend the December 1839 Whig National Convention in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, but Weed did on his behalf. They were determined to support General Winfield Scott for president, but when Weed concluded Scott could not win, he threw New York&#x27;s support behind the eventual winner, General William Henry Harrison. This action outraged supporters of Senator Clay. These grievances would not be quickly forgotten—one supporter of the Kentuckian wrote in 1847 that he was intent on seeing the &quot;punishment of Seward &amp; Co. for defrauding the country of Mr. Clay in 1840&quot;.

Seward was renominated for a second term by the Whig convention against Democrat William C. Bouck, a former state legislator. Seward did not campaign in person, but ran affairs behind the scenes with Weed and made his views known to voters through a Fourth of July speech and lengthy letters, declining invitations to speak, printed in the papers. In one, Seward expounded upon the importance of the log cabin—a structure evoking the common man and a theme that the Whigs used heavily in Harrison&#x27;s campaign—where Seward had always found a far warmer welcome than in the marble palaces of the well-to-do (evoking Van Buren). Both Harrison and Seward were elected. Although Seward would serve for nearly thirty more years in public life, his name would never again pass before the voters.

In his second term, Seward was involved with the trial of Alexander McLeod, who had boasted of involvement in the 1837 &quot;Caroline&quot; Affair, in which Canadians came across the Niagara River and sank the &quot;Caroline&quot;, a steamboat being used to supply William Lyon Mackenzie&#x27;s fighters during the Upper Canada Rebellion. McLeod was arrested, but the British Foreign Minister, Lord Palmerston, demanded his release. McLeod, who was part of the Canadian colonial militia, could not be held responsible for actions taken under orders. Although the Van Buren administration had agreed with Seward that McLeod should be tried under state law, its successor did not and urged that charges against McLeod be dropped. A series of testy letters were exchanged between Governor Seward and Harrison&#x27;s Secretary of State Daniel Webster, and also between the governor and the new president John Tyler, who succeeded on Harrison&#x27;s death after a month in office. McLeod was tried and acquitted in late 1841. Stahr pointed out that Seward got his way in having McLeod tried in a state court, and the diplomatic experience served him well as Secretary of State.

Seward continued his support of blacks, signing legislation in 1841 to repeal a &quot;nine-month law&quot; that allowed slaveholders to bring their slaves into the state for a period of nine months before they were considered free. After this, slaves brought to the state were immediately considered freed. Seward also signed legislation to establish public education for all children, leaving it up to local jurisdictions as to how that would be supplied (some had segregated schools).

==Out of office==

As governor, Seward incurred considerable personal debt not only because he had to live beyond his salary to maintain the lifestyle expected of the office, but also because he could not pay down his obligation from the land company purchase. At the time he left office, he owed $200,000. Returning to Auburn, he absorbed himself in a profitable law practice. He did not abandon politics and received former president Adams at the Seward family home in 1843.

According to his biographer, John M. Taylor, Seward picked a good time to absent himself from electoral politics, as the Whig Party was in turmoil. President Tyler, a former Democrat, and Senator Clay each claimed leadership of the Whig Party and, as the two men differed over such issues as whether to re-establish the Bank of the United States, party support was divided. The abolitionist movement attracted those who did not want to be part of a party led by slavery-supporting Southerners. In 1844, Seward was asked to run for president by members of the Liberty Party; he declined and reluctantly supported the Whig nominee, Clay. The Kentuckian was defeated by Democrat James K. Polk. The major event of Polk&#x27;s administration was the Mexican–American War; Seward did not support this, feeling that the price in blood was not worth the increase in territory, especially as southerners were promoting this acquisition to expand territory for slavery.

In 1846, Seward became the center of controversy in Auburn when he defended, in separate cases, two felons accused of murder. Henry Wyatt, a white man, was charged with fatally stabbing a fellow inmate in prison; William Freeman, a black man, was accused of breaking into a house after his release and stabbing four people to death. In both cases, the defendants were likely mentally ill and had been severely abused while in prison. Seward, having long been an advocate of prison reform and better treatment for the insane, sought to prevent each man from being executed by using the relatively new defense of insanity. Seward gained a hung jury in Wyatt&#x27;s first trial, though he was subsequently convicted in a retrial and executed despite Seward&#x27;s efforts to secure clemency. Freeman was convicted, though Seward gained a reversal on appeal. There was no second Freeman trial, as officials were convinced of his insanity. Freeman died in prison in late 1846. In the Freeman case, invoking mental illness and racial issues, Seward argued, &quot;he is still your brother, and mine, in form and color accepted and approved by his Father, and yours, and mine, and bears equally with us the proudest inheritance of our race—the image of our Maker. Hold him then to be a Man.&quot;

Although they were locally contentious, the trials boosted Seward&#x27;s image across the North. He gained further publicity in association with Ohioan Salmon P. Chase when handling the unsuccessful appeal in the United States Supreme Court of John Van Zandt, an anti-slavery advocate sued by a slaveowner for assisting blacks in escaping on the Underground Railroad. Chase was impressed with Seward, writing that the former New York governor &quot;was one of the very first public men in our country. Who but himself would have done what he did for the poor wretch Freeman?&quot;

The main Whig contenders in 1848 were Clay again, and two war hero generals with little political experience, Winfield Scott and Zachary Taylor. Seward supported General Taylor. The former governor was less enthusiastic about the vice-presidential candidate, New York State Comptroller Millard Fillmore, a rival of his from Buffalo. Nevertheless, he campaigned widely for the Whigs against the Democratic presidential candidate, former Michigan senator Lewis Cass. The two major parties did not make slavery an issue in the campaign. The Free Soil Party, mostly Liberty Party members and some Northern Democrats, nominated former president Van Buren. The Taylor/Fillmore ticket was elected, and the split in the New York Democratic Party allowed the Whigs to capture the legislature.

State legislatures elected U.S. senators until the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913. One of New York&#x27;s seats was up for election in 1849, and a Whig would likely be elected to replace John Adams Dix. Seward, with Weed&#x27;s counsel, decided to seek the seat. When legislators convened in January 1849, he was spoken of as the favorite. Some opposed him as too extreme on slavery issues and intimated that he would not support the slaveholding President-elect Taylor, a Louisianan. Weed and Seward worked to dispel these concerns, and when the vote for the Senate seat took place, the former governor received five times the vote of the nearest other candidate, gaining election on the first ballot.

==U.S. Senator==

===First term===
William Seward was sworn in as senator from New York on March 5, 1849, during the brief special session called to confirm President Taylor&#x27;s Cabinet nominees. Seward was seen as having influence over Taylor. Taking advantage of an acquaintance with Taylor&#x27;s brother, Seward met with the former general several times before Inauguration Day (March 4) and was friendly with Cabinet officers. Taylor hoped to gain the admission of California to the Union, and Seward worked to advance his agenda in the Senate.

The regular session of Congress that began in December 1849 was dominated by the issue of slavery. Senator Clay advanced a series of resolutions, which became known as the Compromise of 1850, giving victories to both North and South. Seward opposed the pro-slavery elements of the Compromise, and in a speech on the Senate floor on March 11, 1850, invoked a &quot;higher law than the Constitution&quot;. The speech was widely reprinted and made Seward the leading anti-slavery advocate in the Senate. President Taylor took a stance sympathetic to the North, but his death in July 1850 caused the accession of the pro-Compromise Fillmore and ended Seward&#x27;s influence over patronage. The Compromise passed, and many Seward adherents in federal office in New York were replaced by Fillmore appointees.
Although Clay had hoped the Compromise would be a final settlement on the matter of slavery that could unite the nation, it divided his Whig Party, especially when the 1852 Whig National Convention endorsed it to the anger of liberal northerners like Seward. The major candidates for the presidential nomination were President Fillmore, Senator Daniel Webster, and General Scott. Seward supported Scott, who he hoped would, like Harrison, unite enough voters behind a military hero to win the election. Scott gained the nomination, and Seward campaigned for him. The Whigs were unable to reconcile over slavery, whereas the Democrats could unite behind the Compromise; the Whigs won only four states, and former New Hampshire senator Franklin Pierce was elected president. Other events, such as the 1852 publication of &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; and Northern anger over the enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act (an element of the Compromise), widened the divide between North and South.

Seward&#x27;s wife Frances was deeply committed to the abolitionist movement. In the 1850s, the Seward family opened their Auburn home as a safehouse to fugitive slaves on the Underground Railroad. Seward&#x27;s frequent travel and political work suggest that it was Frances who played the more active role in Auburn abolitionist activities. In the excitement following the rescue and safe transport of fugitive slave William &quot;Jerry&quot; Henry in Syracuse on October 1, 1851, Frances wrote to her husband, &quot;two fugitives have gone to Canada—one of them our acquaintance John&quot;. Another time she wrote, &quot;A man by the name of William Johnson will apply to you for assistance to purchase the freedom of his daughter. You will see that I have given him something by his book. I told him I thought you would give him more.&quot;

In January 1854, Democratic Illinois Senator Stephen A. Douglas introduced his Kansas–Nebraska Bill. This would permit territories to choose whether to join the Union as free or slave states, and effectively repeal the Missouri Compromise forbidding slavery in new states north of 36° 30′ North latitude. Seward was determined to defeat what he called &quot;this infamous Nebraska Bill,&quot; and worked to ensure the final version of the bill would be unpalatable to enough senators, North and South, to defeat it. Seward spoke against the bill both on initial consideration in the Senate and when the bill returned after reconciliation with the House. The bill passed into law, but northerners had found a standard around which they could rally. Those in the South defended the new law, arguing that they should have an equal stake through slavery in the territories their blood and money had helped secure.

===Second term===

The political turmoil engendered by the North–South divide split both major parties and led to the founding of new ones. The American Party (known as the Know Nothings) contained many nativists and pursued an anti-immigrant agenda. The Know Nothings did not publicly discuss party deliberations (thus, they knew nothing). They disliked Seward, and an uncertain number of Know Nothings sought the Whig nomination to legislative seats. Some made clear their stance by pledging to vote against Seward&#x27;s re-election, but others did not. Although the Whigs won a majority in both houses of the state legislature, the extent of their support for Seward as a US senator was unclear. When the election was held by the legislature in February 1855, Seward won a narrow majority in each house. The opposition was scattered, and a Know Nothing party organ denounced two dozen legislators as &quot;traitors&quot;.

The Republican Party had been founded in 1854, in reaction to the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Its anti-slavery stance was attractive to Seward, but he needed the Whig structure in New York to get re-elected. In September 1855, the New York Whig and Republican parties held simultaneous conventions that quickly merged into one. Seward was the most prominent figure to join the new party and was spoken of as a possible presidential candidate in 1856. Weed, however, did not feel that the new party was strong enough on a national level to secure the presidency, and advised Seward to wait until 1860. When Seward&#x27;s name was mentioned at the 1856 Republican National Convention, a huge ovation broke out. In the 1856 presidential election, the Democratic candidate, former Pennsylvania senator James Buchanan, defeated the Republican, former California senator John C. Frémont, and the Know Nothing candidate, former president Fillmore.

The 1856 campaign played out against the backdrop of &quot;Bleeding Kansas&quot;, the violent efforts of pro- and anti-slavery forces to control the government in Kansas Territory and determine whether it would be admitted as a slave or free state. This violence spilled over into the Senate chamber itself after Republican Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner delivered an incendiary speech against slavery, making personal comments against South Carolina Senator Andrew P. Butler. Sumner had read a draft of the speech to Seward, who had advised him to omit the personal references. Two days after the speech, Butler&#x27;s nephew, Congressman Preston Brooks entered the chamber and beat Sumner with a cane, injuring him severely. Although some southerners feared the propaganda value of the incident in the North, most lionized Brooks as a hero. Many northerners were outraged, though some, including Seward, felt that Sumner&#x27;s words against Butler had unnecessarily provoked the attack. Some Southern newspapers felt that the Sumner precedent might usefully be applied to Seward; the &quot;Petersburg Intelligencer&quot;, a Virginia periodical, suggested that &quot;it will be very well to give Seward a double dose at least every other day&quot;.

In a message to Congress in December 1857, President Buchanan advocated the admission of Kansas as a slave state under the Lecompton Constitution, passed under dubious circumstances. This split the Democrats: the administration wanted Kansas admitted; Senator Douglas demanded a fair ratification vote. The Senate debated the matter through much of early 1858, though few Republicans spoke at first, content to watch the Democrats tear their party to shreds over the issue of slavery. The issue was complicated by the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling the previous year in &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot; that neither Congress nor a local government could ban slavery in the territories.

In a speech on March 3 in the Senate, Seward &quot;delighted Republican ears and utterly appalled administration Democrats, especially the Southerners&quot;. Discussing &quot;Dred Scott&quot;, Seward accused Buchanan and Chief Justice Roger B. Taney of conspiring to gain the result and threatened to reform the courts to eliminate Southern power. Taney later told a friend that if Seward had been elected in 1860, he would have refused to administer the oath of office. Buchanan reportedly denied the senator access to the White House. Seward predicted slavery was doomed:
Southerners saw this as a threat, by the man deemed the likely Republican nominee in 1860, to force change on the South whether it liked it or not. Statehood for Kansas failed for the time being, but Seward&#x27;s words were repeatedly cited by Southern senators as the secession crisis grew. Nevertheless, Seward remained on excellent personal terms with individual southerners such as Mississippi&#x27;s Jefferson Davis. His dinner parties, where those from both sides of the sectional divide mingled, were a Washington legend.

With an eye to a presidential bid in 1860, Seward tried to appear a statesman who could be trusted by both North and South. Seward did not believe the federal government could mandate emancipation but that it would develop by action of the slave states as the nation urbanized and slavery became uneconomical, as it had in New York. Southerners still believed that he was threatening the forcible ending of slavery. While campaigning for Republicans in the 1858 midterm elections, Seward gave a speech at Rochester that proved divisive and quotable, alleging that the U.S. had two &quot;antagonistic systems [that] are continually coming into closer contact, and collision results ... It is an irrepressible conflict between opposing and enduring forces, and it means that the United States must and will, sooner or later, become entirely either a slave-holding nation, or entirely a free-labor nation.&quot; White southerners saw the &quot;irrepressible conflict&quot; speech as a declaration of war, and Seward&#x27;s vehemence ultimately damaged his chances of gaining the presidential nomination.

==Election of 1860==

===Candidate for the nomination===

In 1859, Seward was advised by his political supporters that he would be better off avoiding additional controversial statements, and left the country for an eight-month tour of Europe and the Middle East. Seward spent two months in London, meeting with the Prime Minister, Lord Palmerston, and was presented at Court to Queen Victoria. Seward returned to Washington in January 1860 to find controversy: that some southerners blamed him for his rhetoric, which they believed had inspired John Brown to try to start a slave insurrection. Brown was captured and executed; nevertheless, Mississippi representatives Reuben Davis and Otho Singleton each stated that if Seward or another Radical Republican was elected, he would meet with the resistance of a united South. To rebut such allegations, and to set forth his views in the hope of receiving the nomination, Seward made a major speech in the Senate on February 29, 1860, which most praised, though white southerners were offended, and some abolitionists also objected because the senator, in his speech, said that Brown was justly punished. The Republican National Committee ordered 250,000 copies in pamphlet form, and eventually twice that many were printed.

Weed sometimes expressed certainty that Seward would be nominated; at other times he expressed gloom at the thought of the convention fight. He had some reason for doubt, as word from Weed&#x27;s agents across the country was mixed. Many in the Midwest did not want the issue of slavery to dominate the campaign, and with Seward as the nominee, it inevitably would. The Know Nothing Party was still alive in the Northeast, and was hostile to Seward for his pro-immigrant stance, creating doubts as to whether Seward could win Pennsylvania and New Jersey, where there were many nativists, in the general election. These states were crucial to a Republican nominee faced with a Solid South. Conservative factions in the evolving Republican Party opposed Seward.

===Convention===

There were no primaries in 1860, no way to be certain how many delegates a candidate might receive. Nevertheless, going into the 1860 Republican National Convention in May in Chicago, Seward was seen as the overwhelming favorite. Others spoken of for the nomination included Ohio Governor Salmon P. Chase, former Missouri congressman Edward Bates, and former Illinois congressman Abraham Lincoln.

Seward stayed in Auburn during the convention; Weed was present on his behalf and worked to shore up Seward&#x27;s support. He was amply supplied with money: business owners had eagerly given, expecting Seward to be the next president. Weed&#x27;s reputation was not entirely positive; he was believed corrupt by some, and his association both helped and hurt Seward.
Enemies such as publisher and former Seward ally Horace Greeley cast doubts as to Seward&#x27;s electability in the battleground states of Illinois, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. Lincoln had worked hard to gain a reputation as a moderate in the party and hoped to be seen as a consensus second choice, who might be successful in those critical states, of which the Republicans had to win three to secure the election. Lincoln&#x27;s men, led by his friend David Davis, were active on his behalf. As Lincoln had not been seen as a major candidate, his supporters had been able to influence the decision to hold the convention in his home state, and surrounded the New York delegation, pro-Seward, with Lincoln loyalists. They were eventually successful in gaining the support of the delegations from the other battleground states, boosting delegates&#x27; perceptions of Lincoln&#x27;s electability. Although Lincoln and Seward shared many views, Lincoln, out of office since 1849, had not excited opposition as Seward had in the South and among Know Nothings. Lincoln&#x27;s views on nativism, which he opposed, were not public.

On the first ballot, Seward had 173½ votes to Lincoln&#x27;s 102, with 233 needed to nominate. Pennsylvania shifted its vote to Lincoln on the second ballot, and Seward&#x27;s lead was cut to 184½ to 181. On the third, Lincoln had 231½ to Seward&#x27;s 180 after the roll call, but Ohio changed four votes from Chase to Lincoln, giving the Illinoian the nomination and starting a small stampede; the nomination was eventually made unanimous. By the accounts of witnesses, when word reached Seward by telegraph he calmly remarked that Lincoln had some of the attributes needed to be president, and would certainly be elected.

===Campaigning for Lincoln===

Despite his public nonchalance, Seward was devastated by his convention loss, as were many of his supporters. The New Yorker was the best-known and most popular Republican, and his defeat shocked many in the North, who felt that Lincoln had been nominated through chicanery. Although Seward sent a letter stating Weed was not to blame, Seward&#x27;s political manager took the defeat hard. Seward was initially inclined to retire from public life but received many letters from supporters: distrustful of Lincoln, they urged Seward to remain involved in politics. On his way to Washington to return to Senate duties, he stopped in Albany to confer with Weed, who had gone to Lincoln&#x27;s home in Springfield, Illinois, to meet with the candidate, and had been very impressed at Lincoln&#x27;s political understanding. At the Capitol, Seward received sympathy even from sectional foes such as Jefferson Davis.

Lincoln faced three major opponents. A split in the Democratic Party had led northerners to nominate Senator Douglas, while southerners chose Vice President John C. Breckinridge. The Constitutional Union Party, a new party consisting mostly of former Southern Whigs, selected former Tennessee senator John Bell. As Lincoln would not even be on the ballot in ten southern states, he needed to win almost every northern state to take the presidency. Douglas was said to be strong in Illinois and Indiana, and if he took those, the election might be thrown into the House of Representatives. Seward was urged to undertake a campaign tour of the Midwest in support of Lincoln and did so for five weeks in September and October, attracting huge crowds. He journeyed by rail and boat as far north as Saint Paul, Minnesota, into the border state of Missouri at St. Louis, and even to Kansas Territory, though it had no electoral votes to cast in the election. When the train passed through Springfield, Seward and Lincoln were introduced, with Lincoln appearing &quot;embarrassed&quot; and Seward &quot;constrained&quot;. In his oratory, Seward spoke of the U.S. as a &quot;tower of freedom&quot;, a Union that might even come to include Canada, Latin America, and Russian America.

New York was key to the election; a Lincoln loss there would deadlock the Electoral College. Soon after his return from his Midwest tour, Seward embarked on another, speaking to large crowds across the state of New York. At Weed&#x27;s urging, he went to New York City and gave a patriotic speech before a large crowd on November 3, only three days before the election. On Election Day, Lincoln carried most Northern states, while Breckinridge took the Deep South, Bell three border states, and Douglas won Missouri—the only state Seward campaigned in that Lincoln did not win. Lincoln was elected.

==Secession crisis==

Lincoln&#x27;s election had been anticipated in Southern states, and South Carolina and other Deep South states began to call conventions for the purpose of secession. In the North, there was dissent over whether to offer concessions to the South to preserve the Union, and if conciliation failed, whether to allow the South to depart in peace. Seward favored compromise. He had hoped to remain at home until the New Year, but with the deepening crisis left for Washington in time for the new session of Congress in early December.

The usual tradition was for the leading figure of the winning party to be offered the position of Secretary of State, the most senior Cabinet post. Seward was that person, and around December 12, the vice president-elect, Maine Senator Hannibal Hamlin, offered Seward the position on Lincoln&#x27;s behalf. At Weed&#x27;s advice, Seward was slow to formally accept, doing so on December 28, 1860, though well before Inauguration Day, March 4, 1861. Lincoln remained in Illinois until mid-February, and he and Seward communicated by letter.

As states in the Deep South prepared to secede in late 1860, Seward met with important figures from both sides of the sectional divide. Seward introduced a proposed constitutional amendment preventing federal interference with slavery. This was done at Lincoln&#x27;s private request; the president-elect hoped that the amendment, and a change to the Fugitive Slave Act to allow those captured a jury trial, would satisfy both sides. Congressmen introduced many such proposals, and Seward was appointed to a committee of 13 senators to consider them. Lincoln was willing to guarantee the security of slavery in the states that currently had it, but he rejected any proposal that would allow slavery to expand. It was increasingly clear that the deep South was committed to secession; the Republican hope was to provide compromises to keep the border slave states in the Union. Seward voted against the Crittenden Compromise on December 28, but quietly continued to seek a compromise that would keep the border states in the Union.

Seward gave a major speech on January 12, 1861. By then, he was known to be Lincoln&#x27;s choice as Secretary of State, and with Lincoln staying silent, it was widely expected that he would propound the new administration&#x27;s plan to save the Union. Accordingly, he spoke to a crowded Senate, where even Jefferson Davis attended despite Mississippi&#x27;s secession, and to packed galleries. He urged the preservation of the Union, and supported an amendment such as the one he had introduced, or a constitutional convention, once passions had cooled. He hinted that New Mexico Territory might be a slave state, and urged the construction of two transcontinental railroads, one northern, one southern. He suggested the passage of legislation to bar interstate invasions such as that by John Brown. Although Seward&#x27;s speech was widely applauded, it gained a mixed reaction in the border states to which he had tried to appeal. Radical Republicans were not willing to make concessions to the South, and were angered by the speech. Pennsylvania Congressman Thaddeus Stevens, a radical, warned that if Lincoln, like Seward, ignored the Republican platform and tried to purchase peace through concessions, he would retire, as too old to bear the years of warfare in the Republican Party that would result.

Lincoln applauded Seward&#x27;s speech, which he read in Springfield, but refused to approve any compromise that could lead to a further expansion of slavery. Once Lincoln left Springfield on February 11, he gave speeches, stating in Indianapolis that it would not be coercing a state if the federal government insisted on retaining or retaking property that belonged to it. This came as the United States Army still held Fort Sumter; the president-elect&#x27;s words upset moderate southerners. Virginia Congressman Sherrard Clemens wrote, 

Lincoln arrived in Washington, unannounced and incognito, early on the morning of February 23, 1861. Seward had been advised by General Winfield Scott that there was a plot to assassinate Lincoln in Baltimore when he passed through the city. Senator Seward sent his son Frederick to warn Lincoln in Philadelphia, and the president-elect decided to travel alone but for well-armed bodyguards. Lincoln travelled without incident and came to regret his decision as he was widely mocked for it. Later that morning, Seward accompanied Lincoln to the White House, where he introduced the Illinoisan to President Buchanan.

Seward and Lincoln differed over two issues in the days before the inauguration: the composition of Lincoln&#x27;s cabinet, and his inaugural address. Given a draft of the address, Seward softened it to make it less confrontational toward the South; Lincoln accepted many of the changes, though he gave it, according to Seward biographer Glyndon G. Van Deusen, &quot;a simplicity and a poetic quality lacking in Seward&#x27;s draft&quot;. The differences regarding the Cabinet revolved around the inclusion of Salmon Chase, a radical. Lincoln wanted all elements of the party, as well as representation from outside it; Seward opposed Chase, as well as former Democrats such as Gideon Welles and Montgomery Blair. Seward did not get his way, and gave Lincoln a letter declining the post of Secretary of State. Lincoln felt, as he told his private secretary, John Nicolay, that he could not &quot;afford to let Seward take the first trick&quot;. No reply or acknowledgment was made by Lincoln until after the inaugural ceremonies were over on March 4, when he asked Seward to remain. Seward did and was both nominated and confirmed by the Senate, with minimal debate, on March 5, 1861.

==Secretary of State==

===Lincoln administration===

====War breaks out====
Lincoln faced the question of what to do about Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor, held by the Army against the will of South Carolinians, who had blockaded it. The fort&#x27;s commander, Major Robert Anderson, had sent word that he would run out of supplies. Seward, backed by most of the Cabinet, recommended to Lincoln that an attempt to resupply Sumter would be provocative to the border states, that Lincoln hoped to keep from seceding. Seward hinted to the commissioners who had come to Washington on behalf of the Confederacy that Sumter would be surrendered. Lincoln was loath to give up Sumter, feeling it would only encourage the South in its insurgency.

With the Sumter issue unresolved, Seward sent Lincoln a memorandum on April 1, proposing various courses of action, including possibly declaring war on France and Spain if certain conditions were not met, and reinforcing the forts along the Gulf of Mexico. In any event, vigorous policies were needed and the president must either establish them himself or allow a Cabinet member to do so, with Seward making it clear he was willing to do it. Lincoln drafted a reply indicating that whatever policy was adopted, &quot;I must do it&quot;, though he never sent it, but met with Seward instead, and what passed between them is not known. Seward&#x27;s biographers make the point that the note was sent to a Lincoln who had not yet proved himself in office.

Lincoln decided on expeditions to try to relieve Sumter and Florida&#x27;s Fort Pickens. Meanwhile, Seward was assuring Justice John Archibald Campbell, the intermediary with the Confederate commissioners who had come to Washington in an attempt to secure recognition, that no hostile action would be taken. Lincoln sent a notification to South Carolina&#x27;s governor of the expedition, and on April 12, Charleston&#x27;s batteries began firing on Sumter, beginning the Civil War.

====Diplomacy====

When the war started, Seward turned his attention to making sure that foreign powers did not interfere in the conflict. When the Confederacy announced in April 1861 that it would authorize privateers, Seward sent word to the American representatives abroad that the U.S. would become party to the Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law of 1856. This would outlaw such vessels, but Britain required that, if the U.S. were to become a party, the ratification would not require action to be taken against Confederate vessels.

The Palmerston government considered recognizing the Confederacy as an independent nation. Seward was willing to wage war against Britain if it did and drafted a strong letter for the American Minister in London, Charles Francis Adams, to read to the Foreign Secretary, Lord Russell. Seward submitted it to Lincoln, who, realizing that the Union was in no position to battle both the South and Britain, toned it down considerably, and made it merely a memorandum for Adams&#x27;s guidance.

In May 1861, Britain and France declared the South to be belligerents by international law, and their ships were entitled to the same rights as U.S.-flagged vessels, including the right to remain 24 hours in neutral ports. Nevertheless, Seward was pleased that both nations would not meet with Confederate commissioners or recognize the South as a nation. Britain did not challenge the Union blockade of Confederate ports, and Seward wrote that if Britain continued to avoid interfering in the war, he would not be overly sensitive to what wording they used to describe their policies.

In November 1861, the , commanded by Captain Charles Wilkes, intercepted the British mail ship RMS &quot;Trent&quot; and removed two Confederate diplomats, James Mason and John Slidell. They were held in Boston amid jubilation in the North and outrage in Britain. The British minister in Washington, Lord Lyons, demanded their release, as the U.S. had no right to stop a British-flagged ship traveling between neutral ports. The British drew up war plans to attack New York and sent reinforcements to Canada. Seward worked to defuse the situation. He persuaded Lyons to postpone delivering an ultimatum and told Lincoln that the prisoners would have to be released. Lincoln did let them go, reluctantly, on technical grounds. Relations between the U.S. and Britain soon improved; in April 1862, Seward and Lyons signed a treaty they had negotiated allowing each nation to inspect the other&#x27;s ships for contraband slaves. In November 1862, with America&#x27;s image in Britain improved by the issuance of the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, the British cabinet decided against recognition of the Confederacy as a nation.

Despite Britain&#x27;s neutrality, Confederate agents in Britain had arranged for the purchases of arms to be delivered to Confederate ports through blockade runners as well as the construction of Confederate warships, most notably the CSS &quot;Alabama&quot;, which ravaged Union shipping after her construction in 1862. With two more such vessels under construction the following year, supposedly for French interests, Seward pressed Palmerston not to allow the warships to leave port, and, nearly complete, they were seized by British officials in October 1863. However, Britain&#x27;s complicity in allowing its blockade runners loaded with weapons to Confederate ports lengthened the Civil War by two years and killed 400,000 more Americans. This caused strained relations between the UK and the U.S.

====Involvement in wartime detentions====
From the start of the war until early 1862, when responsibility was passed to the War Department, Seward was in charge of determining who should be detained without charges or trial. Approximately 800 men and a few women, believed to be Southern sympathizers or spies, were detained, usually at the initiation of local officials. Once Seward was informed, he would often order that the prisoner be transferred to federal authorities. Seward was reported to have boasted to Lord Lyons that &quot;I can touch a bell on my right hand, and order the arrest of a citizen ... and no power on earth, except that of the President, can release them. Can the Queen of England do so much?&quot;

In September 1861, Maryland legislators planned to vote to leave the Union. Seward took action against them: his son Frederick, the United States Assistant Secretary of State, reported to his father that the disloyal legislators were in prison. On the evidence provided by detective Allen Pinkerton, Seward in 1862 ordered the arrest of Rose Greenhow, a Washington socialite with Confederate sympathies. Greenhow had sent a stream of reports south, which continued even after she was placed under house arrest. From Washington&#x27;s Old Capitol Prison, the &quot;Rebel Rose&quot; provided newspaper interviews until she was allowed to cross into Confederate territory.

When Seward received allegations that former president Pierce was involved in a plot against the Union, he asked Pierce for an explanation. Pierce indignantly denied it. The matter proved to be a hoax, and the administration was embarrassed. On February 14, 1862, Lincoln ordered that responsibility for detentions be transferred to the War Department, ending Seward&#x27;s part in them.

====Relationship with Lincoln====

Seward had mixed feelings about the man who had blocked him from the presidency. One story is that when Seward was told that to deny Carl Schurz an office would disappoint him, Seward angrily stated, &quot;Disappointment! You speak to me of disappointment! To me, who was justly entitled to the Republican nomination for the presidency, and who had to stand aside and see it given to a little Illinois lawyer!&quot; Despite his initial reservations about Lincoln&#x27;s abilities, he came to admire Lincoln as the president grew more confident in his job. Seward wrote to his wife in June 1861, &quot;Executive skill and vigor are rare qualities. The President is the best of us, but he needs constant and assiduous cooperation.&quot; According to Goodwin, &quot;Seward would become his most faithful ally in the cabinet ... Seward&#x27;s mortification at not having received his party&#x27;s nomination never fully abated, but he no longer felt compelled to belittle Lincoln to ease his pain.&quot; Lincoln, a one-term congressman, was inexperienced in Washington ways and relied on Seward&#x27;s advice on protocol and social etiquette.

The two men built a close personal and professional relationship. Lincoln fell into the habit of entrusting Seward with tasks not within the remit of the State Department, for example asking him to examine a treaty with the Delaware Indians. Lincoln would come to Seward&#x27;s house and the two lawyers would relax before the fire, chatting. Seward began to feature in the president&#x27;s humorous stories. For example, Lincoln would tell of Seward remonstrating with the president, whom he found polishing his boots, &quot;In Washington, we do not blacken our own boots,&quot; with Lincoln&#x27;s response, &quot;Indeed, then whose boots &quot;do&quot; you blacken, Mr. Secretary?&quot;

Other cabinet members became resentful of Seward, who seemed to be always present when they discussed their departments&#x27; concerns with Lincoln, yet they were never allowed to be there when the two men discussed foreign affairs. Seward announced when cabinet meetings would be; his colleagues eventually persuaded Lincoln to set a regular date and time for those sessions. Seward&#x27;s position on the Emancipation Proclamation when Lincoln read it to his cabinet in July 1862 is uncertain; Secretary of War Edwin Stanton wrote at the time that Seward opposed it in principle, feeling the slaves should simply be freed as Union armies advanced. Two later accounts indicate that Seward felt that it was not yet time to issue it, and Lincoln did wait until after the bloody stalemate at Antietam that ended Confederate General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s incursion into the North to issue it. In the interim, Seward cautiously investigated how foreign powers might react to such a proclamation, and learned it would make them less likely to interfere in the conflict.

Seward was not close to Lincoln&#x27;s wife Mary, who by some accounts had opposed his appointment as Secretary of State. Mary Lincoln developed such a dislike for Seward that she instructed her coachman to avoid passing by the Seward residence. The Secretary of State enjoyed the company of the younger Lincoln boys, Willie and Tad, presenting them with two cats from his assortment of pets.

Seward accompanied Lincoln to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, in November 1863, where Lincoln was to deliver a short speech, that would become famous as the Gettysburg Address. The night before the speech, Lincoln met with Seward. There is no surviving evidence that Seward contributed any changes: he stated after the address, when asked if had had any hand in it, that only Lincoln could have made that speech. Seward also proposed to Lincoln that he proclaim a day of national thanksgiving, and drafted a proclamation to that effect. Although post-harvest thanksgiving celebrations had long been held, this first formalized Thanksgiving Day as a national observance.

====1864 election; Hampton Roads Conference====
It was far from certain that Lincoln would even be nominated in 1864, let alone re-elected, as the tide of war, though generally favoring the North, washed back and forth. Lincoln sought nomination by the National Union Party, composed of Republicans and War Democrats. No one proved willing to oppose Lincoln, who was nominated. Seward was by then unpopular among many Republicans and opponents sought to prompt his replacement by making Lincoln&#x27;s running mate former New York Democratic senator Daniel S. Dickinson; under the political customs of the time, one state could not hold two positions as prestigious as vice president and Secretary of State. Administration forces turned back Dickinson&#x27;s bid, nominating instead Military Governor of Tennessee Andrew Johnson, with whom Seward had served in the Senate. Lincoln was re-elected in November; Seward sat with Lincoln and the assistant presidential secretary, John Hay, as the returns came in.
In January 1865, Francis Preston Blair, father of former Lincoln Postmaster General Montgomery Blair, went, with Lincoln&#x27;s knowledge, to the Confederate capital of Richmond to propose to Davis that North and South unite to expel the French from their domination of Mexico. Davis appointed commissioners (Vice President Alexander Stephens, former U.S. Supreme Court justice Campbell, and former Confederate Secretary of State Robert M. T. Hunter) to negotiate. They met with Lincoln and Seward at the Hampton Roads Conference the following month. Lincoln would settle for nothing short of a cessation of resistance to the federal government and an end to slavery; the Confederates would not even concede that they and the Union were one nation. There was much friendly talk, as most of them had served together in Washington, but no agreement. After the conference broke up, Seward sent a bucket of champagne to the Confederates, conveyed by a black oarsman in a rowboat, and called to the southerners, &quot;keep the champagne, but return the Negro.&quot;

====Assassination attempt====
John Wilkes Booth had originally planned to kidnap Lincoln, and recruited conspirators, including Lewis Powell, to help him. Having found no opportunity to abduct the president, on April 14, 1865, Booth assigned Powell to assassinate Seward and George Atzerodt to kill Vice President Johnson. Booth himself would kill Lincoln. The plan was to slay the three senior members of the Executive Branch.

Accordingly, another member of the conspiracy, David Herold, led Powell to the Seward home on horseback and was responsible for holding Powell&#x27;s horse while he committed the attack. Seward had been hurt in an accident some days before, and Powell gained entry to the home on the excuse he was delivering medicine to the injured man, but was stopped at the top of the stairs by Seward&#x27;s son Frederick, who insisted Powell give him the medicine. Powell instead attempted to fire on Frederick and beat him over the head with the barrel of his gun when it misfired. Powell burst through the door, threw Fanny Seward (Seward&#x27;s daughter) to one side, jumped on the bed, and stabbed William Seward in the face and neck five times. A soldier assigned to guard and nurse the secretary, Private George F. Robinson, jumped on Powell, forcing him from the bed. Private Robinson and Augustus Henry Seward, another of Seward&#x27;s sons, were also injured in their struggle with the would-be assassin. Ultimately, Powell fled, stabbing a messenger, Emerick Hansell, as he went, only to find that Herold, panicked by the screams from the house, had left with both horses. Seward was at first thought dead, but revived enough to instruct Robinson to send for the police and lock the house until they arrived.
Almost simultaneously with the attack on Seward, Booth had mortally wounded Lincoln at Ford&#x27;s Theatre. Atzerodt, however, decided not to go through with the attack on Johnson. When Secretary of War Edwin Stanton and Navy Secretary Gideon Welles hurried to Seward&#x27;s home to find out what had happened, they found blood everywhere.

All five men injured that night at the Seward home survived. Powell was captured the next day at the boarding house of Mary Surratt. He was hanged on July 7, 1865, along with Herold, Atzerodt, and Surratt, convicted as conspirators in the Lincoln assassination. Their deaths occurred only weeks after that of Seward&#x27;s wife Frances, who never recovered from the shock of the assassination attempt.

===Johnson administration===

====Reconstruction and impeachment====

In the first months of the new Johnson administration, Seward did not work much with the president. Seward was at first recovering from his injuries, and Johnson was ill for a time in the summer of 1865. Seward was likely in accord with Johnson&#x27;s relatively gentle terms for the South&#x27;s re-entry to the Union, and with his pardon of all Confederates but those of high rank. Radical Republicans such as Stanton and Representative Thaddeus Stevens proposed that the freed slaves be given the vote, but Seward was content to leave that to the states (few Northern states gave African-Americans the ballot), believing the priority should be reconciling the power-holding white populations of the North and South to each other.

Unlike Lincoln, who had a close rapport with Seward, Johnson kept his own counsel and generally did not take advantage of Seward&#x27;s political advice as Congress prepared to meet in December 1865. Johnson had issued proclamations allowing for the southern states to reform their state governments and hold elections; they mostly elected men who had served as prewar or wartime leaders. Seward advised Johnson to state, in his first annual message to Congress, that southern states meet three conditions for readmission to the Union: repeal of secession, repudiation of the war debt incurred by the rebel governments, and ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment. Johnson, hoping to appeal to both Republicans and Democrats, did not take the suggestion. Congress did not seat southerners but appointed a joint committee of both houses to make recommendations on the issue. Johnson opposed the committee; Seward was prepared to wait and see.

In early 1866, Congress and president battled over the extension of the authorization of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau. Both sides agreed that the bureau should end after the states were re-admitted, the question was whether that would be soon. With Seward&#x27;s support, Johnson vetoed the bill. Republicans in Congress were angry with both men, and tried but failed to override Johnson&#x27;s veto. Johnson vetoed the Civil Rights Bill, which was to grant citizenship to the freedmen. Seward advised a conciliatory veto message; Johnson ignored him, telling Congress it had no right to pass bills affecting the South until it seated the region&#x27;s congressmen. This time Congress overrode his veto, gaining the necessary two-thirds majority of each house, the first time this had been done on a major piece of legislation in American history.
Johnson hoped the public would elect congressmen who agreed with him in the 1866 midterm elections, and embarked on a trip, dubbed the Swing Around the Circle, giving speeches in a number of cities that summer. Seward was among the officials who went with him. The trip was a disaster for Johnson; he made a number of ill-considered statements about his opponents that were criticized in the press. The Radical Republicans were strengthened by the results of the elections. The Republican anger against Johnson extended to his secretary of state—Senator William P. Fessenden of Maine said of Johnson, &quot;he began by meaning well, but I fear that Seward&#x27;s evil counsels have carried him beyond the reach of salvation&quot;.

In February 1867, both houses of Congress passed the Tenure of Office Bill, purporting to restrict Johnson in the removal of presidential appointees. Johnson suspended, then fired, Stanton over Reconstruction policy differences, leading to the president&#x27;s impeachment for allegedly violating the Tenure of Office Act. Seward recommended that Johnson hire the renowned attorney, William M. Evarts, and, with Weed, raised funds for the president&#x27;s successful defense.

====Mexico====
Mexico was strife-torn in the early 1860s, as it often had been in the fifty years since its independence. There had been 36 changes of government and 73 presidents, and a refusal to pay foreign debts. France, Spain, and Great Britain joined together to intervene in 1861 on the pretext of protecting their nationals, and to secure repayment of debt. Spain and the British soon withdrew, but France remained. Seward realized that a challenge to France at this point might provoke its intervention on the Confederate side, so he stayed quiet. In 1864, French emperor Napoleon III set Archduke Maximilian of Austria on the Mexican throne, with French military support. Seward used strident language publicly but was privately conciliatory toward the French.

The Confederates had been supportive of France&#x27;s actions. Upon returning to work after the assassination attempt, Seward warned France that the U.S. still wanted the French gone from Mexico. Napoleon feared that the large, battle-tested American army would be used against his troops. Seward remained conciliatory, and in January 1866, Napoleon agreed to withdraw his troops after a twelve- to eighteen-month period, during which time Maximilian could consolidate his position against the insurgency led by Benito Juárez.

In December 1865, Seward bluntly told Napoleon that the United States desired friendship, but, &quot;this policy would be brought into imminent Jeopardy unless France could deem it consistent with her interest and honor to desist from the prosecution of armed intervention in Mexico.&quot; Napoleon tried to postpone the French departure, but the Americans had General Phil Sheridan and an experienced combat army on the north bank of the Rio Grande and Seward held firm. Napoleon suggested a new Mexican government that would exclude both Maximilian and Juárez. The Americans had recognized Juárez as the legitimate president and were not willing to consider this. In the meantime, Juárez, with the help of American military aid, was advancing through northeast Mexico. The French withdrew in early 1867. Maximilian stayed behind but was soon captured by Juárez&#x27;s troops. Although both the U.S. and France urged Juárez against it, the deposed emperor was executed by firing squad on June 19, 1867.

====Territorial expansion and Alaska====
Although in speeches Seward had predicted all of North America joining the Union, he had, as a senator, opposed the Gadsden Purchase obtaining land from Mexico, and Buchanan&#x27;s attempts to purchase Cuba from Spain. Those stands were because the land to be secured would become slave territory. After the Civil War, this was no longer an issue, and Seward became an ardent expansionist and even contemplated the purchase of Greenland and Iceland, aiming to surround and then potentially annex Canada. The Union Navy had been hampered due to the lack of overseas bases during the war, and Seward also believed that American trade would be helped by the purchase of overseas territory.

Believing, along with Lincoln, that the U.S. needed a naval base in the Caribbean, in January 1865, Seward offered to purchase the Danish West Indies (today the United States Virgin Islands). Late that year, Seward sailed for the Caribbean on a naval vessel. Among the ports of call was St. Thomas in the Danish West Indies, where Seward admired the large, easily defended harbor. Another stop was in the Dominican Republic, where he opened talks to obtain Samaná Bay. When Congress reconvened in December 1866, Seward caused a sensation by entering the chamber of the House of Representatives and sitting down with the administration&#x27;s enemy, Congressman Stevens, persuading him to support an appropriation for more money to expedite the purchase of Samaná, and sent his son Frederick to the Dominican Republic to negotiate a treaty. Both attempts fell through; the Senate, in the dying days of the Johnson administration, failed to ratify a treaty for the purchase of the Danish possessions, while negotiations with the Dominican Republic were not successful.

Seward had been interested in whaling as a senator; his interest in Russian America was a byproduct of this. In his speech prior to the 1860 convention, he predicted the territory would become part of the U.S., and when he learned in 1864 that it might be for sale, he pressed the Russians for negotiations. Russian minister Baron Eduard de Stoeckl recommended the sale. The territory was a money loser, and the Russian-American Company itself allowed its charter to expire in 1861. Russia could use the money more efficiently for its expansion in Siberia or Central Asia. Keeping it ran the risk of it being captured in war by the British, or overrun by American settlers. Stoeckl was given the authority to make the sale and when he returned in March 1867, negotiated with the Secretary of State. Seward initially offered $5 million; the two men settled on $7 million and on March 15, Seward presented a draft treaty to the Cabinet. Stoeckl&#x27;s superiors raised several concerns; to induce him to waive them, the final purchase price was increased to $7.2 million. The treaty was signed in the early morning of March 30, 1867, and ratified by the Senate on April 10. Stevens sent the secretary a note of congratulations, predicting that the Alaska Purchase would be seen as one of Seward&#x27;s greatest accomplishments.

==1868 election, retirement and death==

Seward hoped that Johnson would be nominated at the 1868 Democratic National Convention, but the delegates chose former New York governor Horatio Seymour. The Republicans chose General Ulysses S. Grant, who had a hostile relationship with Johnson. Seward gave a major speech on the eve of the election, endorsing Grant, who was easily elected. Seward met twice with Grant after the election, leading to speculation that he was seeking to remain as secretary for a third presidential term. However, the president-elect had no interest in retaining Seward, and the secretary resigned himself to retirement. Grant refused to have anything to do with Johnson, even declining to ride to his inauguration in the same carriage as the outgoing president, as was customary. Despite Seward&#x27;s attempts to persuade him to attend Grant&#x27;s swearing-in, Johnson and his Cabinet spent the morning of March 4, 1869, at the White House dealing with last-minute business, then left once the time for Grant to be sworn in had passed. Seward returned to Auburn.

Restless in Auburn, Seward embarked on a trip across North America by the new transcontinental railroad. In Salt Lake City, Utah Territory, he met with Brigham Young, President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who had worked as a carpenter on Seward&#x27;s house (then belonging to Judge Miller) as a young man. On reaching the Pacific Coast, the Seward party sailed north on the steamer &quot;Active&quot; to visit Sitka, Department of Alaska, part of the vast wilderness Seward had acquired for the U.S. After spending time in Oregon and California, the party went to Mexico, where he was given a hero&#x27;s welcome. After a visit to Cuba, he returned to the U.S., concluding his nine-month trip in March 1870.

In August 1870, Seward embarked on another trip, this time westbound around the world. With him was Olive Risley, daughter of a Treasury Department official, to whom he became close in his final year in Washington. They visited Japan, then China, where they walked on the Great Wall. During the trip, they decided that Seward would adopt Olive, and he did so, thus putting an end to gossip and the fears of his sons that Seward would remarry late in life. They spent three months in India, then journeyed through the Middle East and Europe, not returning to Auburn until October 1871.

Back in Auburn, Seward began his memoirs, but only reached his thirties before putting it aside to write of his travels. In these months he was steadily growing weaker. On October 10, 1872, he worked at his desk in the morning as usual, then complained of trouble breathing. Seward grew worse during the day, as his family gathered around him. Asked if he had any final words, he said, &quot;Love one another&quot;. Seward died that afternoon. His funeral a few days later was preceded by the people of Auburn and nearby filing past his open casket for four hours. Thurlow Weed was there for the burial of his friend, and Harriet Tubman, a former slave whom the Sewards had aided, sent flowers. President Grant sent his regrets he could not be there. William Seward rests with his wife Frances and daughter Fanny (1844–1866), in Fort Hill Cemetery in Auburn.

==Legacy and historical view==

Seward&#x27;s reputation, controversial in life, remained so in death, dividing his contemporaries. Former navy secretary Gideon Welles argued that not only did Seward lack principles, Welles was unable to understand how Seward had fooled Lincoln into thinking that he did, gaining entry to the Cabinet thereby. Charles Francis Adams, minister in London during Seward&#x27;s tenure as secretary, deemed him &quot;more of a politician than a statesman&quot;, but Charles Anderson Dana, former Assistant Secretary of War, disagreed, writing that Seward had &quot;the most cultivated and comprehensive intellect in the administration&quot; and &quot;what is very rare in a lawyer, a politician, or a statesman—imagination&quot;.

Scholars of history have generally praised Seward for his work as Secretary of State; in 1973, Ernest N. Paolino deemed him &quot;the one outstanding Secretary of State after John Quincy Adams&quot;. Seward has been given high marks by historians both for his achievements in office, and for his foresight in anticipating the future needs of the U.S. According to his biographer Van Deusen, &quot;his foreign policy built for the future. He wished to prepare America for the great era which lay ahead. So he sought bases, naval stations and, peacefully, additional territory.&quot;

Seward&#x27;s biographers suggested that there are two faces to Seward. One, &quot;John Quincy Adams Seward&quot;, dreamed big dreams and tried to convey them in speeches, working to achieve education for all, a fair deal for immigrants, an end to slavery, and an expanded America. The other, &quot;Thurlow Weed Seward&quot;, cut backroom deals over cigars and a bottle, and was a pragmatist who often settled for half a loaf when the whole was not achievable. Daniel S. Crofts, in Seward&#x27;s entry in the &quot;American National Biography&quot; argued, &quot;Each Seward was, of course, a caricature, and both tendencies, at once symbiotic and contradictory, existed in tandem.&quot;

The praise Seward has received extends to his work during the Civil War. Stahr wrote that Seward &quot;skillfully managed the nation&#x27;s foreign affairs, avoiding the foreign intervention that would have ensured that the Confederacy would become a separate nation&quot;. Nevertheless, historians, focusing on the battlefields of the Civil War, have given him relatively little attention. Seward has a dozen biographers, while thousands of books focus on Lincoln. According to Crofts, &quot;Seward and Lincoln were the two most important leaders spawned by the intersection of antebellum idealism and partisan politics. Lincoln, of course, will always overshadow Seward. Before 1860, however, Seward eclipsed Lincoln.&quot;

Lincoln&#x27;s assassination helped to seal his greatness, and according to Seward biographer John M. Taylor, to relegate &quot;his associates ... to the status of bit players.&quot; Dozens of biographies extolling Lincoln as the quintessential American were written in the decades after the president&#x27;s death, placing Lincoln on a pedestal of public esteem Seward could not climb. Seward realized this even in life; by one account, when asked to show his scars from the attempt on his life, Seward regretted he had not been martyred along with Lincoln, &quot;I think I deserved the reward of dying there&quot;.

Despite his being an ardent supporter of American expansionism during his time in the Cabinet, only Alaska was added to U.S. territory during Seward&#x27;s service as Secretary of State. (It should be remembered that the purchase of Alaska from Russia was not inevitable; the land had the same latitude as Siberia and was very difficult to farm, while neither gold nor oil nor any other important mineral was discovered there until years after Seward&#x27;s death.) Nevertheless, his influence extended to later American acquisitions. One of his friends, Hamilton Fish, in 1875 signed the trade reciprocity treaty with the Kingdom of Hawaii that eventually led to the American annexation of the islands. William Everts, another Seward friend, in 1877 signed a treaty of friendship with the Samoan Islands, laying the groundwork for another American acquisition. A young friend and protege of Seward, Lincoln&#x27;s assistant private secretary, John Hay, served as a successor to Seward from 1898 to 1905, during which time the U.S. acquired Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Philippines, and the Panama Canal Zone.

Stahr believes that Seward&#x27;s influence is still felt today:
