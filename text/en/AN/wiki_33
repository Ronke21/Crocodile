<text>In Greek mythology, Orestes or Orestis (; ) was the son of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, and the brother of Electra. He is the subject of several Ancient Greek plays and of various myths connected with his madness, revenge, and purification, which retain obscure threads of much older works. In particular Orestes plays a main role in Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;Oresteia.&quot; 
==Etymology==
The Greek name Ὀρέστης, having become &quot;Orestēs&quot; in Latin and its descendants, is derived from Greek ὄρος (óros, &quot;mountain&quot;) and ἵστημι (hístēmi, &quot;to stand&quot;), and so can be thought to have the meaning &quot;stands on a mountain&quot;.

==Greek literature==

===Homer===
In the Homeric telling of the story, Orestes is a member of the doomed house of Atreus, which is descended from Tantalus and Niobe. He is absent from Mycenae when his father, Agamemnon, returns from the Trojan War with the Trojan princess Cassandra as his concubine, and thus not present for Agamemnon&#x27;s murder by Aegisthus, the lover of his wife, Clytemnestra. Seven years later, Orestes returns from Athens and avenges his father&#x27;s death by slaying both Aegisthus and his own mother Clytemnestra.

In the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Orestes is held up as a favorable example to Telemachus, whose mother Penelope is plagued by suitors.

=== Pindar ===
In Pindar&#x27;s version, the young Orestes was saved by his nurse Arsinoe (Laodamia) or his sister Electra, who conveyed him out of the country when Clytemnestra wished to kill him.
In the familiar theme of the hero&#x27;s early eclipse and exile, he escaped to Phanote on Mount Parnassus, where King Strophius took charge of him.

In his twentieth year, he was urged by Electra to return home and avenge his father&#x27;s death. He returned home, along with his first cousin Pylades, son of Anaxibia (sister to Agamemnon) and Strophius.

== Greek drama ==
The story of Orestes was the subject of the &quot;Oresteia&quot; of Aeschylus (&quot;Agamemnon&quot;, &quot;Choephori&quot;, &quot;Eumenides&quot;), of the &quot;Electra&quot; of Sophocles, and of the &quot;Electra&quot;, &quot;Iphigeneia in Tauris&quot;, &quot;Iphigenia at Aulis&quot; and &quot;Orestes&quot;, all of Euripides. He also appears in Euripides’ &quot;Andromache&quot;.

=== Aeschylus ===
In Aeschylus&#x27;s &quot;Eumenides&quot;, Orestes goes mad after killing his mother and is pursued by the Erinyes (Furies), whose duty it is to punish any violation of the ties of family piety. He takes refuge in the temple at Delphi; but, even though Apollo had ordered him to kill his mother, the god is powerless to protect Orestes from the consequences. At last Athena receives him on the Acropolis of Athens and arranges a formal trial of the case before twelve judges, including herself. The Erinyes demand their victim; Orestes asserts that it was indeed he who killed his mother, though he was acting on the orders of Apollo. At the close of the trial, Athena votes on the verdict last, announcing that she is for acquittal; the votes are counted and the result is a tie, forcing an acquittal in accordance with the rules previously stipulated by Athena. The Erinyes, who insisted on Orestes&#x27; responsibility in the murder, are converted into the Eumenides, who now offer him wisdom and counsel. They are then propitiated by the establishment of a new ritual, in which they are worshipped as &quot;Semnai Theai&quot;, &quot;Venerable Goddesses&quot;, and Orestes dedicates an altar to &quot;Athena Areia&quot;.


=== Euripides ===
As Aeschylus tells it, Orestes&#x27; punishment for matricide ended after a trial, but according to Euripides, in order to escape the persecutions of the Erinyes, Orestes was ordered by Apollo to go to Tauris, carry off the statue of Artemis that had fallen from the heavens, and bring it to Athens. Orestes traveled to Tauris with Pylades, where the pair were at once imprisoned by the people, among whom the custom was to sacrifice all Greek strangers in honor of Artemis. The priestess of Artemis, whose duty it was to perform the sacrifice, was Orestes&#x27; sister Iphigenia. She offered to release him if he would carry home a letter from her to Greece; he refused to go, but he implored Pylades to deliver the letter while he stayed to be slain. After a conflict of mutual affection, Pylades at last yielded, but the brother and sister finally recognized each other due to the letter, and all three escaped together, carrying with them the image of Artemis.

== Other literature and media ==

After his return to Greece, Orestes took possession of his father&#x27;s kingdom of Mycenae (killing his half-brother Alete, who was the son of Clytemestra and Aegisthus), to which were added Argos and Laconia. Orestes was said to have died of a snakebite in Arcadia. His body was conveyed to Sparta for burial (where he was the object of a cult) or, according to a Roman legend, to Aricia, when it was removed to Rome (Servius on Aeneid, ii. 116).

Before the Trojan War, Orestes was to marry his first cousin Hermione, daughter of Menelaus and Helen. Things soon changed after Orestes committed matricide: Menelaus then gave his daughter to Neoptolemus, son of Achilles and Deidamia. According to Euripides&#x27; play Andromache, Orestes slew Neoptolemus just outside a temple and took off with Hermione. He seized Argos and Arcadia after their thrones had become vacant, becoming ruler of all the Peloponnesus. His son by Hermione, Tisamenus, became ruler after him but was eventually killed by the Heracleidae.

There is extant a Latin epic poem, consisting of about 1000 hexameters, called &quot;Orestes Tragoedia&quot;, which has been ascribed to Dracontius of Carthage.
Orestes appears also to be a dramatic prototype for all persons whose crime is mitigated by extenuating circumstances. These legends belong to an age when higher ideas of law and of social duty were being established; the implacable blood-feud of primitive society gives place to a fair trial, and in Athens, when the votes of the judges are evenly divided, mercy prevails.

In one version of the story of Telephus, the infant Orestes was kidnapped by King Telephus, who used him as leverage in his demand that Achilles heal him.

According to some sources, Orestes fathered Penthilus by his half-sister, Erigone.

For modern treatments see the Oresteia in the arts and popular culture.

== Reported remains ==
=== Brought to Sparta ===

In &quot;The History&quot; by Herodotus, the Oracle of Delphi foretold that the Spartans could not defeat the Tegeans until they moved the bones of Orestes to Sparta. Lichas discovered the body, which measured 7 cubits long (311.5 cm if 1 cubit is 44.5 cm). Thus Orestes would have been a Giant. These remains could have belonged to a huge animal from the Pleistocene epoch. Huge bones found in caves in nearby areas of Greece have been attributed to horses (&quot;Equus abeli&quot;), mammoths, elephants, deers, bovids and cetaceans.

=== The ashes of Orestes as &quot;Pignora Imperii&quot; ===
Maurus Servius Honoratus, an early 4th century grammarian, regards the ashes of Orestes (&quot;Cineres Orestis&quot;) as one of the seven &quot;pignora imperii&quot; of the Roman empire in his &quot;In Vergilii Aeneidem commentarii&quot; (‘Commentary on Virgil’s Aeneid’). Alongside the ashes, Servius lists the other six pignora: the stone of the Mother of the Gods, the terracotta chariot of the Veientines, the ancile, the sceptre of Priam, the veil of Iliona, and the palladium.

The ashes were kept at the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitolium.

==Orestes and Pylades==


The relationship between Orestes and Pylades has been presented by some authors of the Roman era (not by classic Greek tragedians) as romantic or homoerotic. A dialogue entitled &quot;Erotes&quot; (&quot;Affairs of the Heart&quot;) and attributed to Lucian compares the merits and advantages of heterosexuality and homoeroticism, and Orestes and Pylades are presented as the principal representatives of homoerotic friendship:

Taking the love god as the mediator of their emotions for each other, they sailed together as it were on the same vessel of life...nor did they restrict their affectionate friendship to the limits of Hellas...as soon as they set foot on the land of the Tauride, the Fury of matricides was there to welcome the strangers, and, when the natives stood around them, the one was struck to the ground by his usual madness and lay there, but Pylades &quot;did wipe away the foam and tend his frame and shelter him with a fine well-woven robe,&quot; thus showing the feelings not merely of a lover, but also of a father. But when it had been decided that, while one remained to be killed, the other should depart for Mycenae to bear a letter, each wished to remain for the sake of the other, considering that he himself lived in the survival of his friend. But Orestes refused to take the letter, claiming Pylades was the fitter person to do so, and thus showed himself almost to be the lover rather than the beloved.
:&quot;L&#x27;Orestie d&#x27;Eschyle&quot; (47)
In 1734, George Frederic Handel&#x27;s opera &quot;Oreste&quot; (based on Giangualberto Barlocci&#x27;s Roman libretto of 1723), was premiered in London&#x27;s Covent Garden.

&quot;L&#x27;Orestie d&#x27;Eschyle&quot; (1913–1923) is a French-language opera in three parts by Darius Milhaud based on &quot;The Oresteia&quot; triptych by Aeschylus in a French translation by his collaborator Paul Claudel.

== Sanctuary of Maniae ==
Pausanias writes that at the road from Megalopolis to Messene there was a sanctuary of goddesses Maniae (meaning madness). Citizens said that it was there that madness overtook Orestes.

<text>El Carmel (), or simply Carmel, is a neighbourhood in the district of Horta-Guinardó, in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.

Carmel is in the municipal district of Horta-Guinardó. The area was developed mainly in the 1960s and 1970s when immigrant workers, encouraged to move to Barcelona by the government of Francoist Spain, built housing for themselves. Initially isolated on the rural hillside of what is now Parc dels Tres Turons (&quot;Three Hills Park&quot;), the combination of structures put up without building permits alongside more planned urban development has given the area its modern appearance of buildings piled higgledy-piggledy on the hillside.

Carmel became infamous in 2005 for a major accident during the construction of a tunnel. It brought to a halt the expansion works on line 5 of the Barcelona Metro and led to the evacuation of dozens of buildings in the area. Local residents protested and most of those evacuated to other areas were eventually rehoused and a new school opened. Barcelona City Council has pledged more investment in the area to improve transport, accessibility and services.

<text>Discovery Channel, known as The Discovery Channel from 1985 to 1995, and often referred to as simply Discovery, is an American cable channel that is best known for its ongoing reality television shows and promotion of pseudoscience. 

It initially provided documentary television programming focused primarily on popular science, technology, and history, but by the 2010s had become increasingly dominated by programs that were reality television shows, promoted conspiracy theories, or advocated junk science. It is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, a publicly traded company run by CEO David Zaslav. , Discovery Channel was the third most widely distributed subscription channel in the United States, behind now-sibling channel TBS and the Weather Channel; it is available in 409 million households worldwide, through its U.S. flagship channel and its various owned or licensed television channels internationally.

, Discovery Channel is available to approximately 71,000,000 pay television households in the United States-down from its peak of 99,000,000 in 2011.

==History==
John Hendricks founded the channel and its parent company, Cable Educational Network Inc., in 1982. Several investors (including the BBC, Allen &amp; Company, and Venture America) raised $5 million in start-up capital to launch the network.

The Discovery Channel began broadcasting on June 17, 1985. It was initially available to 156,000 households and broadcast for 12 hours each day between 3 p.m. and 3 a.m. About 75 percent of its program content had never been broadcast on U.S. television before. In its early years, the channel&#x27;s focus centered on educational programming in the form of cultural and wildlife documentaries, and science and historical specials. It also broadcast some Soviet programming during this time, including the news program &quot;Vremya&quot;. The channel also carried two teletext services over its VBI during this time, Infotext (offering news from the Associated Press, as well as information about agribusiness and agriculture, including commodity prices from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on a 15-minute delay), and Datavizion (offering trivia, strange news stories, games and a satellite TV guide); both services originated from WHA-TV in Madison, Wisconsin, and were run by the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

The channel began to shift its focus in the early 2000s to attract a broader audience, by incorporating more reality-based series focusing on automotive, occupations, and speculative investigation series; though the refocused programming strategy proved popular, Discovery Channel&#x27;s ratings began to decline by the middle of the decade. Some critics said such shows strayed from Discovery&#x27;s intention of providing more educationally based shows aimed at helping viewers learn about the world around them. In 2005, Discovery changed its programming focus to include more popular science and historical themes. The network&#x27;s ratings eventually recovered in 2006.

On January 4, 2006, Discovery Communications announced that anchor Ted Koppel, executive producer Tom Bettag, and eight other former staff members from the ABC newsmagazine &quot;Nightline&quot; were joining Discovery Channel. The network was nominated for seven Primetime Emmy Awards that year for shows including &quot;The Flight that Fought Back&quot; (a documentary about the hijacking of United Airlines Flight 93 during the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001) and &quot;Deadliest Catch&quot; (a reality series about a group of seafood fishermen).

In 2007, Discovery Channel&#x27;s top series included the Emmy Award– and Peabody Award–winning &quot;Planet Earth&quot;, &quot;Dirty Jobs&quot;, &quot;MythBusters&quot;, and &quot;Deadliest Catch&quot;. Discovery Channel&#x27;s 2008 lineup included &quot;Fight Quest&quot; and &quot;Smash Lab&quot;.

On September 1, 2010, 43-year-old James Jay Lee entered the Discovery Communications headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, armed with a handgun. Lee fired at least one shot and held several employees hostage; he was later shot dead by police. Lee had published criticisms of the network at Savetheplanetprotest.com.

In December 2015, Discovery Communications launched its TV Everywhere service, Discovery Go, which features live and video-on-demand content from Discovery Channel and eight of its sister networks.

==Programming==

Programming on the flagship Discovery Channel in the U.S. is primarily focused on reality television series, such as speculative investigation (with shows such as &quot;MythBusters&quot;, &quot;Unsolved History&quot;, and &quot;Best Evidence&quot;), automobiles, and occupations (such as &quot;Dirty Jobs&quot; and &quot;Deadliest Catch&quot;). A popular annual feature on the channel is Shark Week, which airs on Discovery during the summer months.

Discovery has also featured documentaries specifically aimed at families and younger audiences. Other popular programs have included &quot;How It&#x27;s Made&quot;, &quot;Cash Cab&quot;, and &quot;Man vs. Wild&quot;.

==Non-television ventures==

===Pro Cycling Team===

Shortly before the 2004 Tour de France, Discovery Channel announced it would become the primary sponsor of a professional bicycling team starting in 2005, featuring the then-seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong, whose wins were voided after he was proven to have cheated via doping. After the 2007 victory with the Spaniard Alberto Contador, Discovery Channel discontinued the cycling sponsorship.

===Store===
The Discovery Channel stores first opened in 1995. By 1997, the chain had 17 US and 1 UK stores. At that time, the chain was building a flagship store in Washington, DC, with three levels themed to various environments—sea and underground, land and outer space, aviation and science—to be opened in February 1998, with another flagship store in San Francisco to be opened in November 1998.

On May 17, 2007, Discovery Communications announced it would close its standalone and mall-based stores. Hudson Group will continue to operate the Discovery Channel Airport Stores, and the website remains in operation.

===Telescope===

Discovery Channel funded the construction of the Lowell Discovery Telescope, in partnership with Lowell Observatory.

===Website===
Discovery.com is the Discovery Channel&#x27;s official website, which primarily provides information on the channel&#x27;s programming and additional content, including articles, tied to those shows.

==Marketing and branding==

The Discovery Channel&#x27;s first logo was a television screen picturing a map of the world. For two decades, starting in 1987, the channel&#x27;s logo incorporated the Discovery wordmark rendered in the Aurora Bold Condensed font with a circular shape in front of it. The circle usually took the form of a rising sun, or an animated version of the Vitruvian Man. Discovery Channel&#x27;s previous slogans had been &quot;Explore Your World&quot; and &quot;There&#x27;s No Thrill Like Discovery.&quot; Keeping with its changing focus away from strictly educational programming toward reality TV, the slogan was changed in the early 2000s to &quot;Entertain Your Brain&quot;.

In 1995, the channel&#x27;s name was simplified to &quot;Discovery Channel&quot;, dropping &quot;The&quot; from its name. A globe became a permanent part of the logo, and an underline was added to the bottom of the logo

On March 31, 2008, Discovery unveiled a new logo, which took effect on-air on April 15, 2008 (coinciding with the fourth season premiere of &quot;Deadliest Catch&quot;). The new logo was designed by Viewpoint Creative, and integrated Discovery&#x27;s long-time globe iconography into the &quot;D&quot; lettering of the wordmark, creating a monogram that was usable as a standalone icon. The launch was accompanied by a new advertising campaign, &quot;The World is Just Awesome&quot;, which featured scenes of Discovery personalities singing an adapted version of the song &quot;I Love the Mountains&quot;. Discovery Channel president John Ford explained that the campaign was intended to &quot;showcase our earned place in the greater pop culture landscape&quot;.

In August 2013 (coinciding with &quot;Shark Week&quot;), the aforementioned monogram became the main on-air logo as part of a new imaging campaign, &quot;Grab Life By the Globe&quot;, which was designed to emphasize the channel&#x27;s current focus on personality-driven programming. The logo was portrayed in promos with visual effects relevant to their respective program.

On April 1, 2019, Discovery unveiled a new logo, maintaining a refreshed version of the previous globe and D monogram. The new branding is accompanied by another new imaging campaign, &quot;The World is Ours&quot;, which features scenes of Discovery personalities singing the Blue Swede version of &quot;Hooked on a Feeling&quot;. The static version of the globe icon uses a non-standard projection that shows all continents, reflecting Discovery&#x27;s presence as an international brand.

====Canada====

The Canadian version of Discovery was established in 1995 by Labatt Communications, and before 2024 the channel was owned by joint venture of Bell Media and WBD.

The channel airs similar programming to its U.S. counterpart, but also airs domestically produced programs to comply with local broadcasting regulations (which, in the past, included the daily science newsmagazine &quot;Daily Planet&quot; cancelled in 2018). Some of its original series (such as, most prominently, &quot;How It&#x27;s Made&quot;) have been picked up in the U.S. by Discovery&#x27;s sister networks (such as Science Channel), but others have not necessarily aired on Discovery&#x27;s networks. Since 2018, the channel has increasingly aired blocks of fiction programming with science- or technology-oriented themes.

In June 2024, Rogers Sports &amp; Media announced that it had acquired the Canadian rights to all WBD factual and lifestyle brands beginning January 1, 2025, including Discovery Channel. Bell subsequently announced that it would enter into a licensing agreement with NBCUniversal for two of its Discovery-branded channels, with Discovery being relaunched as USA Network on January 1, 2025. A new iteration of Discovery owned by Rogers concurrently launched the same day.

====India====
Discovery Channel was launched in 1995 in India broadcasting originally in English and Hindi.

====Europe====

In the United Kingdom, Discovery Channel UK airs some common programs as the U.S. version, including &quot;MythBusters&quot;, &quot;American Chopper&quot;, &quot;How It&#x27;s Made&quot; and &quot;Deadliest Catch&quot;.

Discovery UK also operates Discovery HD, Discovery Knowledge, Discovery Turbo, Discovery Science, Animal Planet, DMAX, Discovery Real Time, Discovery Home &amp; Health, Discovery Travel &amp; Leisure and Discovery Shed. Many of these channels also have timeshifted versions. In the Republic of Ireland, the UK version of Discovery Channel is available on most cable providers in that country, but with local advertisements.

In Germany, Austria and Switzerland, Discovery Channel is part of the Premiere digital network and supplies specific programs to other networks like ZDF and kabel eins. Discovery Communications is also owner of the documentary-channel XXP. The channel was bought in the spring of 2006 from its former shareholders Spiegel TV and &quot;dctp&quot;. All programs are dubbed into German. The channel is now known as &quot;DMAX&quot;, presumably to associate the channel with Discovery.

In the Netherlands, the Discovery Channel is included on most cable, IPTV and DVB-T providers. Nearly all of the programs are broadcast in their original language, but they are subtitled in Dutch as is the policy of all Dutch television stations. Some programs and most promotions and program announcements have a Dutch voice-over. In Flanders, the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium, a Flemish Discovery Channel launched (previously the Dutch version was available for IPTV, DVB-C and DVB-S) on cable (and digital) television on October 1, 2009.

In Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Croatia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Serbia and Slovenia, Discovery Channel is carried by most cable television and IPTV providers with all the content subtitled in the respective languages. Additionally, it is also available on digital satellite platforms in Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia (sometimes requiring an additional fee). In Poland, nc+ broadcasts the programs dubbed in Polish and in original English. A few other channels from Discovery are also in offer, like Discovery Historia, launched in cooperation with Polish broadcaster TVN, which later ended.

In Spain, the channel shares a schedule and programs with Portugal and is available on most satellite and cable platforms, making it possible to broadcast both in Spanish and Portuguese. In Spain, all programs are dubbed; whereas in Portugal, most of them are subtitled. In addition, Portugal has three Discovery-branded channels: Discovery Turbo (focusing on motorsports), Discovery Science (focusing on science and technology) and Discovery Civilization (focusing on historical events). These channels follow the same model as the original Discovery Channel, except for the absence of advertising. Spanish advertisements are broadcast on the Portuguese feed, non-subtitled or dubbed.
====Southeast Asia====

In South East Asia, Discovery Channel is available on digital subscription television. Discovery Channel Asia still shows crime programs (such as &quot;Most Evil&quot; and &quot;The FBI Files&quot;). Many programs feature development and society in Asian countries, especially in India and China. Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore have other channels branched from the main Discovery Channel, including Discovery Turbo, Discovery Science, Discovery Home &amp; Health and Discovery Travel &amp; Living.

The Philippines has its own semifeed derived from the Southeast Asian channel, in which offers regional variations with local advertisements during the commercial breaks.

==Controversies==
===RFID===
In August 2008, it was reported by &quot;The Consumerist&quot; that Discovery Channel had preempted an episode of &quot;MythBusters&quot; examining RFID security in regard to its implementation in credit cards before its original broadcast because the episode would upset credit card companies, who are major advertisers on Discovery Channel. It was later determined that the decision not to investigate the issue was made by Beyond Productions, the &quot;MythBusters&quot; production company, and was not made by Discovery Channel or their advertising department.

===&quot;Enigmatic Malaysia&quot;===

An ad promoting &quot;Enigmatic Malaysia&quot;, a special series on the network meant to highlight the cultural heritages of Malaysia, mistakenly featured Balinese Pendet dancers. This prompted outrage from Balinese dancers, who posted messages demanding that Malaysia apologize over the misinformation, which then sparked a series of street protests. Further demands were made from the local governments, cultural historians and the tourism ministry in Indonesia for Malaysia to clarify the situation. The Malaysian government reportedly offered an apology, which was rejected by the Indonesian tourism minister, since the apology was given informally by phone, the Indonesian tourism minister demanded a written apology to make it more accountable.

===Shark Week===

Shark Week, Discovery&#x27;s annual shark-themed programming block, has been criticized for sensationalism and the promotion of junk science.

===Romanian RCS&amp;RDS===
In November 2012, the Romanian RCS&amp;RDS, the largest company of its kind on the internal market, interrupted its carriage of Discovery Communications channels, including Discovery Channel. The CEO of Discovery Communications Mark Hollinger sent an open letter in his attempt to counteract the action of RCS&amp;RDS, attracting the attention to the negation of the alleged right of the viewer to choose the viewed channels. In turn, RCS&amp;RDS issued a press statement accusing of hypocrisy Hollinger&#x27;s discourse attentive at the needs of viewers and attracted attention to the fact that, during negotiations, the main preoccupations of the Discovery representatives was maintaining as high as possible tariffs and monetary gains&quot;.

After four years of absence, on December 30, 2016, the Discovery Channel and its sister channel TLC returned to the RCS&amp;RDS CATV, IPTV and DTH networks.

===&quot;Eaten Alive&quot;===
&quot;Eaten Alive&quot; was a television program in which wildlife filmmaker Paul Rosolie was purportedly going to be &quot;eaten alive&quot; by an anaconda. It aired on December 7, 2014. When the special aired, the anaconda attacked Rosolie but did not swallow him, as its title had implied, prompting numerous complaints of a bait and switch.

=== &quot;World’s Ultimate Frontier&quot; ===

In February 2024, a group of US congressmen sent a letter to the CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery criticizing &quot;World&#x27;s Ultimate Frontier&quot;, a joint production between Discovery and Chinese state media outlet China Global Television Network (CGTN), for &quot;whitewashing genocide&quot; of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang. They called on Discovery to &quot;suspend this partnership with CGTN immediately and to abstain from entering into any similar partnership with any other agent of CCP influence.&quot;

<text>Disney Channel is an American pay television channel that serves as the flagship property of Disney Branded Television, a unit of the Disney Entertainment business segment of the Walt Disney Company.

Launched on April 18, 1983, under the name The Disney Channel as a premium channel on top of basic cable television systems, it originally showcased programming towards families due to availability of home television sets locally at the time. It dropped the &quot;The&quot; word from the name in 1997, thus getting rebranded as just Disney Channel, with its programming since till date shifting focus to target mainly children and adolescents ages 6–14. The channel showcases original first-run children&#x27;s television series, theatrically released and original television films and other selected third-party programming.

, Disney Channel is available to approximately 70 million pay television households in the United States — down from its peak of 100 million households in 2011. The channel&#x27;s international footprint, once encompassing 46 channels available in 33 languages, has also diminished in parts of Europe and most of the Asia-Pacific due to the launch of Disney+ and competition from other streaming and social media platforms.

==History==

Disney Channel launched nationally as a premium channel at 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time on April 18, 1983, under the name The Disney Channel. The channel&#x27;s development with help from its founding president Alan Wagner, and formally announced the launch of its family-oriented cable channel in early 1983. The channel – which initially maintained a 16-hour-per-day programming schedule from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time – would become available on cable providers in all 50 U.S. states by September 1983, and accrue a base of more than 611,000 subscribers by December of that year. In October 1983, the channel debuted its first made-for-cable movie, &quot;Tiger Town&quot;, which earned the channel a CableACE Award. The channel had reached profitability by January 1985, with its programming reaching 1.75 million subscribers by that point.

In September 1990, TCI&#x27;s Montgomery, Alabama, system became the first cable provider to carry the channel as a basic cable service. Between 1991 and 1996, a steadily increasing number of cable providers began shifting The Disney Channel from a premium add-on offering to their basic tiers, either experimentally or on a full-time basis; however, Walt Disney Company executives denied any plans to convert the channel into an ad-supported basic service, stating that the premium-to-basic shifts on some providers was part of a five-year &quot;hybrid&quot; strategy that allowed providers to offer the channel in either manner. On April 6, 1997, the channel officially rebranded as Disney Channel, although occasionally marketed as &quot;Disney&quot; from 1997 to 2002.

===Movie library===
Television films have also been produced for broadcast on Disney Channel since its launch under the banner of &quot;Disney Channel Premiere Films&quot;, with the first film released being &quot;Tiger Town&quot; in 1983, until October 1997, which is when they stopped using the &quot;Premiere Films&quot; label and renamed it the &quot;Disney Channel Original Movies&quot; (DCOM) thereafter. The first movie to be released under the Disney Channel Original Movie category was &quot;Under Wraps&quot;, a Halloween themed movie that aired for the first time on Disney Channel on October 25, 1997.

The most successful original film under the banner in terms of popularity and accolades is &quot;High School Musical 2&quot;, which debuted on August 17, 2007, to 17.2 million viewers and set a current longstanding record for the highest-rated television premiere in the history of the channel. Following &quot;High School Musical 2&quot;, the movie that had the second highest-rated Disney Channel Original Movie (DCOM) premiere was &quot;Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie&quot;, followed by &quot;Camp Rock&quot;, &quot;Descendants 2&quot;, &quot;Princess Protection Program&quot;, &quot;Teen Beach Movie&quot;, and &quot;Jump In!&quot;. It also set a basic cable record for the single most-watched television program until December 3, 2007, when corporate sister channel, ESPN, surpassed it with the telecast of an NFL game between the New England Patriots and Baltimore Ravens on its &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; programme by 0.3 million viewers more (17.5 million viewers). &quot;The Cheetah Girls&quot; media franchise was also notably successful in terms of merchandise and sales for its concert tours and soundtrack albums. Its debut film from 2003, being the first Disney Channel original musical television film, premiered to over 84 million global viewers and its sequel premiered to 8.1 million American viewers and in the process became the most successful of the film series. An 86-date concert tour featuring the eponymous girl group was ranked as one of the top 10 concert tours of 2006, smashing the record at the Houston Rodeo previously set by Elvis Presley in 1973, selling out with 73,500 tickets in three minutes at one point.

In addition to its original television films, Disney Channel has rights to theatrically released feature films, with some film rights shared with sister network, Freeform. Alongside films released by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures (mainly consisting of releases from Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Animation Studios and Pixar), the channel also maintains rights to films from other studios. Some films released by Bagdasarian Productions (such as &quot;The Chipmunk Adventure&quot; and &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet Frankenstein&quot;) have also aired on Disney Channel, although most of them are not currently owned by any of the Walt Disney Company&#x27;s divisions.

The block ended on August 29, 1996, due to changes to the channel&#x27;s programming schedule.
* Totally Kids Only (&quot;TKO&quot;) – an afternoon lineup of live-action and animated series introduced in 1992, which became the overall branding for the channel&#x27;s daytime children&#x27;s programs from 1995 to 1996.
* Triple Feature Friday – ran each Friday starting at 5:00 p.m. Eastern/Pacific from October 8, 1993, to May 30, 1997, featured three separate films – sometimes regardless of each film&#x27;s genre – that were tied to a specific subject

The &quot;Block Party&quot; branding was dropped on September 3, 1996, when &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; was removed as the block&#x27;s lead-in and &quot;Goof Troop&quot; was added to end the lineup. This unnamed block continued to air into 1997.
* Magical World of Animals – an hour-long block of wildlife series aimed at children that ran from August 1997 to 1999. Promoted as an offshoot of the &quot;Magical World of Disney&quot; and airing Sunday evenings from 7:00 to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time, the block consisted of two series: &quot;Going Wild with Jeff Corwin&quot; and &quot;Omba Mokomba&quot;.
* Vault Disney – premiered in September 1997, five months after Disney Channel&#x27;s first major rebrand, replacing the Disney Nighttime lineup. Originally airing only on Sunday nights from 9:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. Eastern and Pacific Time, Vault Disney expanded to seven nights a week in September 1998 (the Monday through Saturday editions of the block at this time aired from 11:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. Eastern/Pacific; the start time of the block as a whole was moved consistently to midnight daily in September 1999). The vintage programming featured during the late-night schedule changed to feature only Disney-produced television series and specials (such as &quot;Zorro&quot;, &quot;Spin and Marty&quot;, &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot; and the Walt Disney anthology television series), along with older Disney television specials. Older Disney feature films also were part of the lineup from 1997 to 2000 but aired in a reduced capacity. The block also featured &quot;The Ink and Paint Club&quot;, an anthology series featuring Disney animated shorts, which became the only remaining program on the channel to feature these shorts by 1999, upon the removal of &quot;Quack Pack&quot; from the schedule. The channel discontinued the block in September 2002, in favor of running reruns of its original and acquired series during the late evening and overnight hours (which comparative to the adult-focused Vault Disney, are aimed at children and teenagers, an audience that is typically asleep during that time period).
* Zoog Disney – launched in August 1998, a program block that originally aired only on weekend afternoons from 4:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. Eastern/Pacific. The hosts for the block were &quot;Zoogs&quot;, animated anthropomorphic robot/alien creature-hybrid characters with human voices (some of whom acted like teenagers). The block unified television and the Internet, allowing viewer comments and scores from players of ZoogDisney.com&#x27;s online games to be aired on the channel during regular programming in a ticker format (which the channel continued to use after the block was discontinued, however, the ticker has been all but completely dropped from on-air usage ). From June 2000 to August 2002, the afternoon and primetime lineups on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays were branded under the umbrella title &quot;Zoog Weekendz&quot;. The Zoogs were redesigned with cel shading and given mature voices in 2000, though the remade Zoog characters were discontinued after less than a year; the entire Zoog Disney block was phased out by September 2002.
* Disney Replay – &quot;Disney Replay&quot; was a block that premiered on April 17, 2013, featuring episodes of defunct Disney Channel Original Series that premiered between 2000 and 2007 (such as &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s So Raven, The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody&quot; and &quot;Hannah Montana&quot;). Airing Wednesday nights/early Thursday mornings (as a nod to the popular social media trend &quot;Throwback Thursday&quot;), originally from 12:00 to 1:00 a.m. Eastern and Pacific Time, the block expanded to six hours (running until 6:00 a.m. Eastern/Pacific) on August 14, 2014. Programs featured on Disney Replay were added to the WATCH Disney Channel service on August 16, 2014. The block was discontinued on April 28, 2016, and moved to Freeform with a new name: That&#x27;s So Throwback.
* Disney XD on Disney Channel – &quot;Disney XD on Disney Channel&quot; is the former branding of two blocks airing on Friday and Saturday nights; an animated block airing Fridays from 9:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., showing series mainly exclusive to Disney XD such as &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot;, &quot;Star vs. the Forces of Evil&quot;, &quot;Milo Murphy&#x27;s Law&quot;, and &quot;DuckTales&quot;, and a live-action block airing Saturdays from 10:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m., airing series such as &quot;MECH-X4&quot; and &quot;Walk the Prank&quot;. It was discontinued as Disney XD&#x27;s carriage became equivalent to that of Disney Channel.

===Bumpers===
In between regularly scheduled programming and advertisement breaks, Disney Channel features bumpers. These bumpers have varied in content substantially throughout the history of the channel, created using a broad array of artistic methods such as traditional animation, digital animation, claymation, live action, and puppeteering. They have been praised for their high quality composition and ingenuity.

However, they became especially iconic in September 2002, when Disney Channel underwent a major rebranding, including in its bumpers and logo. These bumpers highlighted the iconic &#x27;mouse ears&#x27; logo throughout them, featuring various videos that culminated in both the appearance of the logo, alongside a newly introduced theme song, which is regarded as its most recognizable and is still used to this day. This theme song consists of a four-note mnemonic jingle composed by Alex Lasarenko, former executive of Tonal Sounds and creative director at Elias Arts.

In addition to its logo and jingle, Disney Channel&#x27;s most recognizable bumper format consists of a celebrity or figure from one of its programs holding a wand and drawing the then-current form of the Disney Channel logo on the screen. This celebrity will introduce their name, the program they are featured on, and finish with the line &quot;And you&#x27;re watching Disney Channel.&quot; Dubbed a &#x27;Wand ID&#x27; by fans, this format typically ends in a variation of the mnemonic.

=== Sports ===
For a period, ESPN&#x27;s broadcasts of the Little League World Series baseball tournament frequently featured cross-promotion with music-related Disney Channel properties, with past editions having featured collaborations with &quot;High School Musical&quot;, the Jonas Brothers, &quot;Camp Rock&quot;, and &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot;.

In March 2023, Disney Channel broadcast a live professional sporting event for the first time, carrying a youth-oriented alternate broadcast of a National Hockey League (NHL) game—known as the &quot;Big City Greens Classic—&quot;as part of ESPN&#x27;s coverage of the league. The broadcast was themed around the Disney Channel animated series &quot;Big City Greens&quot;, visualizing data from the league&#x27;s player and puck tracking system with 3D animated players.

===Current sister channels===
==== Disney Jr. ====

Disney Jr. is a daily morning program block aimed at preschoolers, spiritually succeeding &quot;Playhouse Disney&quot; which launched on April 6, 1997, as part of Disney Channel&#x27;s morning lineup. On May 26, 2010, Disney General Entertainment Content (at the time known as &quot;Disney-ABC Television Group&quot;) announced the expansion of the block in to a 24/7 cable and satellite channel which debuted on March 23, 2012 The channel would be commercial-free channel and compete with other preschooler-skewing cable channels such as the Nick Jr. Channel and Universal Kids (previously known as &quot;PBS Kids Sprout&quot; and then &quot;Sprout&quot;). The channel features programs from Disney Channel&#x27;s existing preschool programming library and films/movies from the Walt Disney Pictures film library. On its launch, Disney Junior took over the channel space held by Soapnet – a Disney-owned cable channel featuring soap operas – due to that genre&#x27;s decline in popularity on broadcast television and the growth of video on demand, online streaming, and digital video recorders negating the need for a linear channel devoted to the soap opera genre. After a period during which cable providers unwilling to drop the network immediately retained it to prevent subscriber cancellations, Soapnet ceased all operations on December 31, 2013. The former Playhouse Disney block on Disney Channel rebranded as Disney Junior on February 14, 2011, along with the existing international channels; they had their names shortened to &quot;Disney Jr.&quot; since June 1, 2024, although spelt/pronounced the same as before. Disney-ABC Television Group once planned to launch a &quot;Playhouse Disney&quot;-branded channel in the United States in 2001, however it never happened despite launching internationally.

====Disney XD====

Launched on February 13, 2009, as the successor to Toon Disney, Disney XD is a cable and satellite television channel which was originally aimed at young male audiences aged 6 to 14, but has since included girls in its programming. The channel showcases action and comedy programming from Disney Channel and the former Jetix block from Toon Disney, alongside some first-run original programming and off-network syndicated shows. Disney XD, unlike its sister channels Disney Channel and Disney Junior, operates as an ad-supported service, similar to its predecessor Toon Disney. The channel carries the same name as an unrelated mini-site and media player on Disney.com, which stood for Disney Xtreme Digital, though it is said that the &quot;XD&quot; in the channel&#x27;s name does not have an actual meaning.

===Former sister channels ===

* Toon Disney – Launched on April 18, 1998, during the 15th anniversary celebration of the launch of sister network, Disney Channel, this channel was aimed at children and teenagers between the ages of 6 and 18. The network&#x27;s main competitors at launch were Cartoon Network from &quot;Warner Bros. Discovery&quot; (a merged company of previous owner Time Warner/WarnerMedia (who absorbed Turner Broadcasting System, the company that launched the channel) and Discovery, Inc.) and Nickelodeon from Paramount Global (formerly the first and the second incarnations of &quot;Viacom&quot; and &quot;ViacomCBS&quot;). Toon Disney initially operated as a commercial-free service from its launch until September 1999 when, unlike Disney Channel, it became ad-supported. The channel carried a mix of reruns of animated productions from Disney Television Animation (formerly &quot;Walt Disney Television Animation&quot;) and Disney Channel, alongside some third-party programs from other distributors, animated films and original programming. In 2004, the channel introduced a nighttime program block aimed at children ages 7 to 14 called Jetix, which featured action-oriented animated and live-action series. During Toon Disney&#x27;s first year on the air, Disney Channel ran a sampler block of Toon Disney&#x27;s programming on Sunday nights for interested subscribers. The network&#x27;s successor, Disney XD, which launched on February 13, 2009, is also a channel also aimed at children and features a broader array of programming, with a heavier emphasis on live-action programs.
* Jetix launched as a programming block in the United States on Toon Disney on February 14, 2004, to compete with Cartoon Network&#x27;s Toonami block, and in Europe in April 2004. By the end of 2004, Jetix started to completely replace global Fox Kids-branded channels, with the first of them being the French version in August 2004 and the last one being the German version in June 2005. The network&#x27;s successor, Disney XD, launched on February 13, 2009, and features heavier emphasis on live-action programs.
** Jetix Play was the sister channel to Jetix and owned by its dedicated company Jetix Europe that was broadcast in a small number of regions, such as Central and Eastern Europe and Middle East. The channel officially launched on January 1, 2005, and was available for 12 hours per day from 6 A.M. to 6 P.M. Jetix Play was aimed at a younger audience than the main Jetix channel and primarily showed archived programming from the catalogues of BVS Entertainment (previously known as &quot;Saban Entertainment&quot;) and Fox Kids Europe. Jetix Play was replaced with Playhouse Disney and later Disney Jr. in most regions by 2010.
* Radio Disney was a radio network aimed towards music programming is oriented towards children, pre-teens and teenagers. Launched on November 18, 1996, the network focused mainly on current hit music and placed a heavy emphasis on talents who signed with Walt Disney Records and/or Hollywood Records, the two record labels of Disney Music Group. On December 3, 2020, the Walt Disney Company announced its closure in first quarter of 2021 during the company&#x27;s restructuring activities. On April 14, 2021, its feeds ceased totally when its last remaining terrestrial station was changed to a simulcast of KSPN.

== Media ==

=== Video games ===
In 2010, &quot;Disney Channel All Star Party&quot; was released for the Nintendo Wii. The four-player mascot party game, in which the stages resemble board games, features characters from Disney Channel programs such as &quot;Sonny with a Chance&quot;, &quot;Wizards of Waverly Place&quot;, and &quot;JONAS L.A.&quot; Several video games based on the Disney Channel animated series &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; were released by Disney Interactive Studios. The Disney Channel website also featured various Flash games incorporating characters from the channel&#x27;s various program franchises, including &quot;Kim Possible&quot; and &quot;Hannah Montana&quot;.

== Marketing programs ==
In June 2012, the Walt Disney Company announced that it would stop advertising or promoting food or beverage products that do not meet strict nutritional guidelines. Disney Channel purportedly became the first media company to take such a stance on stopping the marketing of junk food products to kids. Due to its commercial-free format, such advertising appears only in the form of underwriter sponsorships during promotional breaks.

On July 1, 2012, Disney Channel began providing Descriptive Video Service audio in compliance with the 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010, which required network owned-and-operated stations and affiliates in the 25 largest television markets as well as the five highest-rated cable and satellite channels (including Disney Channel) to offer audio descriptions for the blind. This is accompanied by an on-screen mark at the beginning of certain scheduled programming indicating to viewers that the service is available. Some episodes of &quot;Gravity Falls&quot;, &quot;Austin and Ally&quot;, &quot;Good Luck Charlie,&quot; and &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; show the &quot;AD)))&quot; mark and a 2-tone sound repeated 3 times at the beginning of the episode to give notice of the audio description track available through the SAP feed. Disney Junior displays the &quot;AD))&quot; mark and the intended SAP track on newer episodes of &quot;Little Einsteins&quot;. (ABC positions this mark in the bottom-left corner of the screen.)

==International==
Disney Channel has established presence in various regions across the Americas, most of Europe, the Middle East, Africa, India, and Japan. Channel versions/feeds were also available or used to exist in Australia, New Zealand, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ireland, Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey, but ceased broadcast since the early 2020s, with most content moving to Disney+ or Disney+ Hotstar following their launches in those countries/regions.

On December 14, 2022, Disney ceased its distribution of programs in Russia in response to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Disney Channel also licenses its programming to air on certain other broadcast and cable channels outside the United States (formerly including Family Channel in Canada), regardless of whether or not a localized channel feed already exists in that country.

==Criticism==
Some critics disapprove of the Disney Channel marketing strategy led by Anne Sweeney, president of the Disney Channel from 1996 to 2014. Under Sweeney, the Disney Channel&#x27;s programming was geared mainly towards preteen and teenage girls, with a decrease in animated programming. Criticism was also aimed at removing almost all Walt-era and pre-1990s material from the channel in 2002 with the removal of the late-night &quot;Vault Disney&quot; block devoted to this material, which used to make up the majority of the channel&#x27;s programming since its inception in 1983. In 2008, Sweeney explained that Disney Channel, resulting from its multi-platform marketing strategy using television and music, would become &quot;the major profit driver for the [Walt Disney] Company.&quot;

The channel has also pulled (and sometimes re-shot) episodes that have featured subject matter deemed inappropriate for its target audience, due either to humor or to timing of real-life events.

* In November 2008, the episode &quot;No Sugar, Sugar&quot; (&quot;Hannah Montana&quot;), in which Mitchel Musso&#x27;s character, Oliver Oken, is revealed to have Type 1 diabetes, was pulled before its broadcast, due to parent complaints about its portrayal of diabetics and sugar intake.
* In December 2011, Disney Channel pulled episodes of two of its original series, due to complaints on Twitter from Demi Lovato about their portrayal of eating disorders. Pulled episodes included &quot;Party It Up&quot; (&quot;Shake It Up&quot;) and &quot;Colbie Caillat&quot; (&quot;So Random!&quot;).
* In May 2013, Disney Channel pulled &quot;Quitting Cold Koala&quot; (&quot;Jessie&quot;) due to parental concerns over a scene in which a character&#x27;s gluten-free diet leads to ridicule.
* On June 13, 2023, the opening sequence of the series &quot;Primos&quot;, which premiered on the Disney Channel in July 2024, was released by Disney Branded Television, with a mixed reception to the sequence on social media, including from Latinos and Mexicans. Some viewers argued that the sequence had various negative stereotypes, complained about names of some characters, and claimed the Spanish pronunciation of some characters in the sequence was incorrect.

<text>Pope Nicholas II (; c. 990/995 – 27 July 1061), otherwise known as Gerard of Burgundy, was the head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 24 January 1059 until his death in 27 July 1061. At the time of his election, he was bishop of Florence. During his Papacy, Nicholas II successfully expanded the influence of the papacy in Milan and southern Italy. He was also responsible for passing papal election reforms.

==Early life==
Gerard of Burgundy was born in Chevron, in what is now Savoy. He was a canon at Liège. In 1045 he became bishop of Florence, where he restored the canonical life among the clergy of numerous churches.

==Papacy==
Benedict X was elected in 1058, his election having been arranged by the count of Tusculum. However, several cardinals alleged that the election was irregular and that votes had been bought; these cardinals were forced to flee Rome. Hildebrand, archdeacon of the Roman church, was away on a diplomatic mission to Germany. When he heard of Benedict X&#x27;s election, he opposed it and obtained support for the election of Gerard of Burgundy instead. In December 1058, those cardinals who had opposed Benedict X&#x27;s election met at Siena and elected Gerard as pope instead. He then took the name Nicholas II.

Nicholas II proceeded towards Rome, along the way holding a synod at Sutri, where, in the presence of the Tuscan ruler Godfrey the Bearded and the imperial chancellor, Guibert of Parma, he pronounced Benedict X deposed and excommunicated. The supporters of Nicholas II then gained control of Rome and forced Benedict X to flee to Gerard of Galeria. Having arrived in Rome, Nicholas II then proceeded to wage war against Benedict X and his supporters with Norman assistance. At an initial battle in Campagna in early 1059, Nicholas II was not wholly successful. But later that same year, his forces conquered Praeneste, Tusculum, and Numentanum, and in the autumn took Galeria, forcing Benedict X to surrender and renounce the papacy.

Nicholas II died on 27 July 1061, less than three years after becoming Pope.

===Relationship with the Normans===

To secure his position, Nicholas II at once entered into relations with the Normans. The pope wanted to re-take Sicily for Christianity, and he saw the Normans as the perfect force to crush the Muslims. The Normans were by this time firmly established in southern Italy, and later in the year 1059 the new alliance was cemented at Melfi, where the pope, accompanied by Hildebrand, Cardinal Humbert, and Abbot Desiderius of Monte Cassino, solemnly invested Robert Guiscard with the duchies of Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily, and Richard of Aversa with the principality of Capua, in return for oaths of fealty and the promise of assistance in guarding the rights of the Church. This arrangement, which was based on no firmer foundation than the forged &quot;Donation of Constantine&quot;, was destined to give the papacy independence from both the Eastern and Western Empires. Its first substantial result was Norman aid in taking Galeria, where Antipope Benedict X was hiding, and the end of the subordination of the papacy to the Roman nobles.

===Subordination of Milan===
Meanwhile, Nicholas II sent Peter Damian and Bishop Anselm of Lucca as legates to Milan, to resolve the conflict between the Patarenes and the archbishop and clergy. The result was a fresh triumph for the papacy. Archbishop Wido, facing ruinous ecclesiastical conflict in Milan, submitted to the terms of the legates, which subordinated Milan to Rome. The new relation was advertised by the unwilling attendance of Wido and the other Milanese bishops at the council summoned to the Lateran Palace in April 1059. This council not only continued the Hildebrandine reforms by sharpening the discipline of the clergy but marked an epoch in the history of the papacy by its famous regulation of future elections to the Holy See.

===Election reform===

Previously, papal elections had effectively been controlled by the Roman aristocracy, unless the Holy Roman emperor was strong enough to be able to intervene from a distance to impose his will. As a result of the battles with the Antipope Benedict X, Nicholas II wished to reform papal elections. At the synod held in the Lateran at Easter, 1059, Pope Nicholas brought 113 bishops to Rome to consider several reforms, including a change in the election procedure. The electoral reform adopted by that synod amounted to a declaration of independence on the part of the church. Henceforth, popes were to be selected by the cardinals in assembly in Rome.

<text>Fox Sports Networks (FSN), formerly known as Fox Sports Net, was the collective name for a group of regional sports channels in the United States. Formed in 1996 by News Corporation, the networks were acquired by The Walt Disney Company on March 20, 2019, following its acquisition of 21st Century Fox. A condition of that acquisition imposed by the U.S. Department of Justice required Disney to sell the regional networks by June 18, 2019, ninety days after the completion of its acquisition. Disney subsequently agreed to sell the networks (excluding the YES Network, being reacquired by Yankee Global Enterprises) to Sinclair; the transaction was completed on August 22, 2019. The networks continued to use the Fox Sports name only under a transitional license agreement while rebranding options were explored. A rebranding cross-partnership with Bally&#x27;s Corporation took effect on March 31, 2021, and the networks were rebranded as Bally Sports, ending the Fox Sports Networks branding after 25 years.

Each of the channels in the group carried regional broadcasts of sporting events from various professional, collegiate and high school sports teams (with broadcasts typically exclusive to each individual channel, although some were shown on multiple FSN channels or syndicated to a local broadcast station within a particular team&#x27;s designated market area), along with regional and national sports discussion, documentary and analysis programs.

Depending on their individual team rights, some Fox Sports Networks maintained overflow feeds available via subscription television providers in their home markets, which provided alternate programming when not used to carry game broadcasts that the main feed could not carry due to scheduling conflicts. Fox Sports Networks was headquartered in Houston, Texas, with master control facilities based in both Houston and Los Angeles; FSN also maintained production facilities at Stage 19 at Universal Studios Florida (which formerly served as home of Nickelodeon Studios until its closure in 2005).

==History==

===Beginnings===
At the dawn of the cable television era, many regional sports networks (RSNs) vied to compete with the largest national sports network, ESPN. The most notable were the SportsChannel network, which first began operating in 1976 with the launch of the original SportsChannel (now MSG Sportsnet) in the New York City area and later branched out into channels serving Chicago and Florida; Prime Network, which launched in 1983 with Home Sports Entertainment (now Bally Sports Southwest) as its charter member network and later branched out onto the West Coast as &quot;Prime Sports&quot;; and SportSouth, an RSN operated by the Turner Broadcasting System.

On October 31, 1995, News Corporation, which ten years earlier launched the Fox Broadcasting Company, a general entertainment broadcast network that formed its own sports division in 1994 with the acquisition of the television rights to the National Football Conference of the National Football League, entered into a joint venture with TCI&#x27;s Liberty Media, acquiring a 50% ownership interest in the company&#x27;s Prime Sports affiliates Liberty in turn gained a stake in Fox&#x27;s year-old cable channel FX. On July 3, 1996, News Corporation and Liberty Media/TCI announced that the Prime Sports networks would be rebranded under the new &quot;Fox Sports Net&quot; brand; the Prime Sports-branded affiliates were officially relaunched as Fox Sports Net on November 1 of that year. The first new network to come out of the partnership was Fox Sports Arizona which launched on September 7, 1996, nearly two months before the existing networks would be rebranded. That same year, Fox purchased SportSouth from Turner, and rebranded that network as Fox Sports South in January 1997.

On June 30, 1997, the Fox/Liberty joint venture purchased a 40% interest in Cablevision/NBC&#x27;s sports properties including the SportsChannel America networks, Madison Square Garden, and the New York Knicks and New York Rangers professional sports franchises, a deal worth $850 million; the deal formed the venture National Sports Partners to run Fox Sports Net&#x27;s national programming operations. In early 1998, SportsChannel America was integrated into the Fox Sports Net family of networks; SportsChannel Florida, however, remained as the lone SportsChannel America-branded network before it joined FSN as well in 2000 after News Corporation and Cablevision purchased Florida Panthers owner Wayne Huizenga&#x27;s controlling interest in that network.

===Fox ownership===
In 1999, Liberty Media (which had become a subsidiary of AT&amp;T when AT&amp;T acquired TCI earlier that year) sold its interest in Fox Sports Net and FX to News Corp. The sale was part of a complex transaction involving a stock swap that gave Liberty an 8% interest in News Corp, making it the second largest shareholder. News Corp became the sole owner of Fox Sports Net.

On July 11, 2000, Comcast purchased a majority interest in the Minneapolis-based Midwest Sports Channel and Baltimore-based Home Team Sports from Viacom. News Corporation, a minority owner in both networks, wanted to acquire them outright and integrate the two networks into Fox Sports Net. Home Team Sports had been affiliated with FSN since 1996. The company filed a lawsuit against Comcast ten days later on July 21, in an attempt to block the sale. On September 7, 2000, as part of a settlement between the two companies, Comcast traded its equity interest in Midwest Sports Channel (which became Fox Sports Net North) to News Corporation in exchange for exclusive ownership of Home Team Sports (which subsequently joined competing regional sports network Comcast SportsNet as Comcast SportsNet Mid-Atlantic, now NBC Sports Washington).

In September 2004, Fox Sports Net became known simply as &quot;FSN&quot;; however, the former name remained in common use until 2010, when &quot;Fox Sports Local&quot; was adopted for use in referencing its regional networks. On February 22, 2005, Fox&#x27;s then-parent company, News Corporation, acquired full ownership of FSN/Fox Sports Local, following an asset trade with Cablevision Systems Corporation, in which Fox sold its interest in Madison Square Garden and the arena&#x27;s NBA and NHL team tenants in exchange for acquiring sole ownership of Fox Sports Ohio and Fox Sports Florida. Cablevision simultaneously gained sole ownership of Fox Sports Chicago and Fox Sports New York, and a 50% interest in Fox Sports New England (with Comcast retaining its existing 50% stake); Fox and Cablevision, however, retained joint ownership of Fox Sports Bay Area.

===Affiliate realignments===
Fox Sports Chicago ceased operations in June 2006, after losing the regional cable television rights to local professional teams (including the Chicago Bulls, Blackhawks, Cubs and White Sox) two years earlier to the newly launched Comcast SportsNet Chicago.

On December 22, 2006, News Corporation sold its interest in four Fox Sports regional networks—FSN Utah, FSN Pittsburgh, FSN Northwest and FSN Rocky Mountain—as well as its 38.5% ownership stake in satellite provider DirecTV to Liberty Media for $550 million in cash and stock, in exchange for Liberty&#x27;s 16.3% stake in News Corporation. On May 4, 2009, DirecTV Group Inc. announced it would become a part of Liberty&#x27;s entertainment unit, with plans to spin off certain properties into a separate company under the DirecTV name, which would operate the four acquired FSN-affiliated networks through DirecTV Sports Networks, a new division formed on November 19, 2009, upon the spin-off&#x27;s completion.

On April 30, 2007, Cablevision sold its 50% interests in the New England and Bay Area networks to Comcast for $570 million; both networks became part of Comcast SportsNet, with FSN New England relaunching as Comcast SportsNet New England in July 2007 and FSN Bay Area relaunching as Comcast SportsNet Bay Area March 2008. Despite Cablevision&#x27;s sale of the networks, the channels continued to use &quot;Fox Sports Net/National Sports Partners&quot; in its copyright tag until 2008 (the copyright used has since changed to &quot;National Sports Programming&quot;).

On April 1, 2011, DirecTV Sports Networks rebranded its FSN regional affiliates under the Root Sports brand.

In 2012, News Corporation acquired a 49% stake in the YES Network, the regional sports network in the New York metropolitan area co-owned by Yankee Global Enterprises. It was also in that year that FSN/Fox Sports Local relocated its headquarters from the Fox Studio Lot in Los Angeles to Houston, and then re-branded to its current branding. The FSN owned-and-operated networks were spun off along with most of News Corporation&#x27;s U.S. entertainment properties into 21st Century Fox on July 1, 2013. On January 25, 2014, 21st Century Fox then became the YES Networks&#x27; majority owner by purchasing an additional 31% share of it, increasing the company&#x27;s ownership interest from 49% to 80%. In September 2013, the network gained the affiliation for FSN&#x27;s national programming (sharing it with MSG Plus, the former FSN New York)

=== Sale to Sinclair Broadcast Group ===
On December 14, 2017, The Walt Disney Company announced its intention to acquire 21st Century Fox for $52.4 billion after the spin-off of certain businesses into a new entity (Fox Corporation). While the acquisition was originally slated to include Fox Sports&#x27; regional operations (which, presumably, would have been re-aligned with Disney&#x27;s ESPN division), the Justice Department ordered that they be divested within 90 days of the completion of the acquisition due to the concentration of the market that ESPN would hold.

Sinclair Broadcast Group was mentioned as the most likely buyer for the other FSN networks, but would need the assistance of a private equity firm to help raise the cash needed for the purchase. The group&#x27;s other sports properties include Stadium—a national sports network distributed via over-the-air digital television and internet streaming, Tennis Channel, as well as Marquee Sports Network, a joint venture with the Chicago Cubs. Over 40 parties were reported to have expressed interest, including Silver Lake Partners and William Morris Endeavor in a joint deal, Charter Communications, Discovery (who operates the Eurosport networks in Europe), Amazon, Apollo Global Management, The Blackstone Group, CVC Capital Partners, Ice Cube and LL Cool J, KKR, Nexstar Media Group, Providence Equity Partners and YouTube. Due to a clause imposed on the original sale, Yankee Global Enterprises had a right of first refusal to purchase Fox&#x27;s share in YES Network. Allen &amp; Company and JPMorgan Chase, who were handling the FSN sale for Disney, asked that all bids include YES in their offers.

Fox did not bid for the channels in the first round. On November 20, 2018, Amazon, Sinclair and CVC jointly, Apollo, KKR and Tegna officially bid for the network. It was also reported that a Sinclair/CVC joint venture was the leading bidder. In December 2018, it was reported that due to the low bids, there was the possibility that the networks could be sold individually instead of as a single group, and that the banks were in talks with those who made partial bids, such as Amazon (who only bid for the YES Network) and Charter (who only bid for Fox Sports South). Minnesota Twins owner Jim Pohlad was reportedly interested in his team&#x27;s broadcaster Fox Sports North. Discovery CEO David Zaslav stated that the company had considered a bid, but that regional sports networks were a &quot;very treacherous market&quot;.

In a January 2019 SEC filing, Fox Corporation stated that it no longer had any plans to bid for the channels. On January 11, 2019 CNBC reported that Apollo, Blackstone, CVC and other bidders except Sinclair backed out of the deal for the networks with the sole bidder being the Sinclair/CVC joint venture. It was also reported that the possibility of spinning out the channels as an independent company was also being considered. In February 2019, it was reported that Apollo and Sinclair had dropped out (but with the former seeking a new partner), but that Liberty Media and Major League Baseball had made offers. Later that month, it was reported that Pohlad and Detroit Pistons owner Tom Gores (via his private equity firm Platinum Equity) had joined the Liberty Media bid.

On March 8, 2019, it was reported that the Yankees had reached a deal to re-purchase Fox&#x27;s share in the YES Network for $3.5 billion, with Sinclair, Amazon and The Blackstone Group holding minority shares. MLB also confirmed a $10 billion bid, seeking to use them to bolster the income of its small-market teams. It was also reported that month that Ice Cube and LL Cool J (via Ice Cube&#x27;s 3-on-3 basketball league Big3—which had Fox as its initial broadcast partner) were also preparing a bid of around $15 billion. Big3 stated that it wanted to expand the channels to include programming covering &quot;broader cultural and political topics&quot; of local interest alongside sports. In April 2019, Big3 filed a complaint with the Department of Justice and FCC, accusing Charter Communications of attempting to &quot;undermine&quot; its bid by threatening to not carry the channels if it won the auction. Liberty Media owner John Malone has an ownership stake in Charter; the company denied Big3&#x27;s allegations. The final round of bids were due on April 15, 2019, with bids having been in excess of $10 billion or higher. Liberty and MLB were reported to have partnered on a joint bid, Big3&#x27;s bid contained $6.5 billion in debt and only $3 billion in outside funding, while Sinclair had re-entered contention in a joint bid with Apollo.

On April 26 and May 2, respectively, Fox Business Network and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Sinclair was nearing an agreement to purchase the networks for $10 billion. On May 3, Sinclair officially announced that via its subsidiary Diamond Sports Group, it had agreed to purchase the networks for $10.6 billion, pending regulatory approval. At the same time, it was also revealed that Allen Media Group would hold an equity stake in the company and serve as a &quot;content partner&quot;. Three senators (Cory Booker, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren) called for the sale to be reviewed by the Department of Justice, citing concerns over Sinclair&#x27;s political views, and that it could use the networks as leverage for carriage agreements for its broadcast television stations.

The sale was completed on August 22, 2019. The networks would continue to temporarily use the &quot;Fox Sports&quot; branding under a transitional license agreement with Fox Corporation; Sinclair CEO Chris Ripley stated that there were plans to eventually rebrand them under either a new name, or to &quot;partner with a brand who wants more exposure&quot;. There were also plans to increase non-event programming, and emphasis on sports betting in its programming. In November 2019, the &quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot; reported that Fox Sports Florida was to be rebranded &quot;within the next few months&quot;.

Due to carriage disputes, Dish Network and Sling TV dropped Fox Sports Networks in July 2019. FuboTV dropped the channels in January 2020, and YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV followed in October 2020.

On November 4, 2020, Sinclair took a $4.23 billion write-down on the FSN purchase.

==== Rebranding as Bally Sports ====

On November 17, 2020, it was reported by &quot;Sportico&quot; that Sinclair was considering rebranding the networks via a naming rights agreement, and was reportedly in talks with multiple companies involved in sports betting. The next day, Sinclair announced that it had entered into an agreement with casino operator Bally&#x27;s Corporation to acquire the naming rights under a 10-year deal. The agreement included integration of Bally&#x27;s content on the channels and other Sinclair properties (including its television stations, Stadium, and Tennis Channel), and a warrant giving Sinclair the option to acquire a 14.9% stake in Bally&#x27;s Corporation, and up to 24.9% if performance criteria are met. Sinclair announced in December 2020 that it planned to launch its own direct-to-consumer Bally&#x27;s-branded streaming service, including live streaming of its linear sports networks, in 2021.

On January 27, 2021, Sinclair announced that the networks would be rebranded as Bally Sports with Fox Sports Carolinas and Fox Sports Tennessee discontinued and their sports programming dispersed to the Bally Sports South and Southeast channels. To better reflect their target markets, Prime Ticket and SportsTime Ohio were rebranded as Bally Sports SoCal and Bally Sports Great Lakes, respectively. In March 2021, Sinclair revealed that the relaunch would occur on March 31, the eve of Major League Baseball&#x27;s Opening Day.

====Comcast SportsNet====
From its inception in 1997 until July 31, 2012, Comcast maintained an agreement to carry select programming sourced from Fox Sports Net on its six Comcast SportsNet regional networks: Comcast SportsNet Bay Area, Comcast SportsNet California, Comcast SportsNet Chicago, Comcast SportsNet Mid-Atlantic, Comcast SportsNet New England and Comcast SportsNet Philadelphia.

This deal stemmed from the circumstances surrounding the 1997 launch of the original Comcast SportsNet in Philadelphia, where Rainbow&#x27;s regional sports network SportsChannel Philadelphia, and sister premium service PRISM (which offered a mix of sports and movies) were seemingly gutted by Comcast&#x27;s acquisition of Spectacor—owner of the Philadelphia Flyers—and a stake in the Philadelphia 76ers, with plans to launch their own network, only for Rainbow to join Fox and Liberty, possibly meaning SportsChannel and PRISM would become FSN affiliates instead. Ultimately, the potential issues were settled in a deal that saw PRISM and SportsChannel&#x27;s local coverage move to Comcast SportsNet, which would then become an FSN affiliate, while PRISM was replaced by Liberty&#x27;s premium movie network Starz!.

Most of Fox Sports Networks&#x27; other programming was later carried in the Baltimore and Washington, D.C. markets on MASN2. Select games were also shown on Cox Communications local origination channels (later branded YurView), mostly in Rhode Island and Virginia. The Cox networks were exclusive to their cable systems.

===Broadcast TV partners===
At least two times in its history Fox Sports Net, partnered with broadcast TV stations to fill coverage gaps in markets where it did not have an affiliated regional sports network. Upon its launch, Fox Sports Net did not have an outlet in New York, the nation&#x27;s largest media market (Cablevision&#x27;s SportsChannel would not merge into Fox Sports until the following year). To overcome this obstacle, Fox Sports Net paid WBIS-TV $30 million to broadcast games and nightly news shows for the next five years. WBIS-TV itself was a new station that launched on July 1, 1996, when Dow Jones &amp; Company and ITT Corporation purchased it from the City of New York. The Fox Sports programming complimented its &quot;S+&quot; format which combined sports programming and business news.

From September 2012 to September 2013, Fox syndicated select college football and basketball games produced by the Fox Sports regional networks to broadcast television stations in some of the markets where the aforementioned Comcast SportsNet had dropped coverage. These stations included WLVI (Boston), KICU-TV (San Francisco), WMCN-TV (Philadelphia) and WDCA (Washington, D.C.).

===Fox College Sports (FCS)===
Fox Sports Networks also operated Fox College Sports (FCS), a slate of three digital cable channels (Fox College Sports Atlantic, Fox College Sports Central and Fox College Sports Pacific) featuring programming divided by region (primarily collegiate and high school sports, as well as minor league sports events) from each individual FSN network; the FCS networks also carry each affiliate&#x27;s regional sports news programs and non-news-and-event programming (such as coaches shows, team magazines and documentaries). The three networks were, more or less, condensed versions of the 22 FSN-affiliated networks (including Comcast SportsNet Mid-Atlantic), though the channels also showed international events that did not fit within the programming inventories of FSN or Fox Soccer Plus (and prior to 2013, the latter&#x27;s now-defunct parent Fox Soccer), such as the Commonwealth Games, World University Games and the FINA World Swimming Championships.

The three FCS channels offered FSN feeds from the following channels, including live Big 12 Conference football, Pac-12 Conference football and basketball and Atlantic Coast Conference basketball games. The channels also rebroadcast shows originally produced by and shown on the following listed networks:
* FCS Atlantic: Fox Sports South, Fox Sports Carolinas, Fox Sports Tennessee, Fox Sports Southeast, Fox Sports Florida, Fox Sports Sun, MSG Plus and AT&amp;T SportsNet Pittsburgh;
* FCS Central: Fox Sports Detroit, Fox Sports Southwest, Fox Sports Oklahoma, Fox Sports North, Fox Sports Wisconsin, Fox Sports Midwest, Fox Sports Kansas City, Fox Sports Indiana and Fox Sports Ohio;
* FCS Pacific: Fox Sports Arizona, Fox Sports West/Prime Ticket, AT&amp;T SportsNet Rocky Mountain and Root Sports Northwest.

Fox College Sports also broadcast high school and Independent Women&#x27;s Football League games, and college magazine and coach&#x27;s shows. Fox College Sports formerly partnered with Big Ten Network to provide programming.

==High definition==
All of the Fox Sports Networks regional affiliates maintained high-definition simulcast feeds presented in 720p (the default resolution format for 21st Century Fox&#x27;s broadcast and pay television properties). All sports programming broadcast on each of the networks (including most team-related analysis and discussion programs, and non-event amateur sports programs) was broadcast in a format optimized for 16:9 widescreen displays, with graphics framed within a widescreen safe area rather than the 4:3 safe area, intended to be shown in a letterboxed format for standard definition viewers.

==National programs==

===Programming strategy===
The programming strategy adopted by most of the Fox Sports Networks was to acquire the play-by-play broadcast rights to major sports teams in their regional market. This did not include NFL games, since the league&#x27;s contracts require all games to be aired on broadcast television in each participating team&#x27;s local markets. Therefore, FSN focused on other major professional leagues, like the MLB, NHL, NBA and WNBA.

In addition to local play-by-play coverage, the FSN networks also broadcast and produced pre-game shows, post-game shows and weekly &quot;magazine&quot; shows centered on the teams that maintained rights with the individual network. In some markets, FSN competed directly with other regional sports networks for the broadcast rights to team-specific programming. FSN networks also purchased shows or broker time slots for sports and outdoors programming from outside producers in their region to fill out their schedule further, with Fox Sports purchasing additional programming for national airing. Finally, low-trafficked late night and early morning timeslots were programmed locally with paid programming.

Also, FSN competed directly with ESPN in acquiring the conference rights to various collegiate sports events. One notable agreement was that with the Pac-12 Conference, in which packages of football and men&#x27;s basketball regular season games were broadcast across all FSN networks within the regions served by each Pac-12 member university. Fox Sports Networks broadcast the majority of the Pac-12 Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournament, except the tournament final, as well as a few Pac-12 matches from other conference-sanctioned sports (such as baseball and volleyball).

Besides play-by-play game rights, FSN provided a common set of programming that was available to all its regional sports networks, most notably &quot;The Dan Patrick Show&quot;, &quot;The Best Damn Sports Show Period&quot; and &quot;Final Score&quot; (&quot;TBDSSP&quot; and &quot;Final Score&quot; eventually ceased production, while &quot;The Dan Patrick Show&quot; later moved to the NBC Sports Network). Until August 2012, in some of regions served by that RSN, member channels of the competing Comcast SportsNet (as mentioned above) carried FSN programming through broadcast agreements with Fox Sports.

Fox Sports Networks&#x27; national sports telecasts were formerly marketed under the &quot;FSN&quot; brand; these national programs began to use more generic branding with fewer references to FSN or Fox in 2008, as a result of a number of Fox Sports Net affiliates being rebranded or realigned with other RSN chains (including FSN New England and FSN Bay Area, which both became part of Comcast SportsNet; FSN New York&#x27;s relaunch as MSG Plus, the sister to MSG Network; and the eventual relaunch of several FSN affiliates acquired by DirecTV Sports Networks under the Root Sports brand); however, these networks later reverted to utilizing Fox branding on their FSN-syndicated broadcasts.

===National prime time programming===
In addition to regional programming, the Fox Sports Networks carried some prime time programming distributed to all of the regional networks (including past and present series such as &quot;The Best Damn Sports Show Period&quot; and &quot;Chris Myers Interviews&quot;). FSN tried to compete with ESPN in regards to original programming, most notably with the &quot;National Sports Report&quot;, a daily sports news program designed to compete with ESPN&#x27;s &quot;SportsCenter&quot;, which debuted on FSN in 1996. Originally a two-hour program known as &quot;Fox Sports News&quot;, the running time of &quot;National Sports Report&quot; was steadily cut back (eventually dwindling to 30 minutes) as its ratings declined and the cost of producing the program increased. FSN hired popular former &quot;SportsCenter&quot; anchor Keith Olbermann and used him to promote the show heavily; ratings continued to slide (especially as &quot;Best Damn Sports Show Period&quot;&#x27;s popularity increased), however, leading Fox Sports to cancel the &quot;National Sports Report&quot;, which aired its last edition in February 2002.

In some markets, FSN aired the &quot;Regional Sports Report&quot; (whose headline title was usually customized with the name of the region in which the particular program was broadcast, such as the &quot;Midwest Sports Report&quot; or &quot;Detroit Sports Report&quot;), a companion news program focusing primarily on regional sports as well as highlights and news on other sports teams that debuted in 2000 to complement the &quot;National Sports Report&quot;; many of the regional reports were cancelled in 2002 due to increasing costs of producing the individual programs.

Most of the national studio programming seen on FSN originated from the Fox Television Center in Hollywood, California; in 1998, operations moved to the new Fox Network Center, located on the 20th Century Fox backlot in Century City. Some programming was instead produced from the FSN headquarters in the Westwood district.

==Teams by network==

==Pay-per-view==
FSN distributed its first pay-per-view event on November 10, 2006, a boxing match in which former heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield defeated Fres Oquendo in a unanimous decision at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas. The fight was also streamed free of charge on the FoxSports.com website outside the United States.

FSN also provided pay-per-view coverage of select college football games. These were usually early-season games, and would feature either a Big 12 or SEC team against a lesser-known opponent. The pay-per-view coverage of SEC games ended upon the launch of the SEC Network in 2014, and most Big 12 schools phased out pay-per-view telecasts around this time as well. Oklahoma was the last school to feature select games on pay-per-view, doing so through 2021.

==Americans in Focus==
In February 2008, FSN launched a public service initiative called &quot;Americans in Focus&quot;, with the sponsorship support of Farmers Insurance. This initiative consists of one-minute vignettes profiling non-white persons, with segments airing on the FSN networks in February 2008 and 2009 during Black History Month, from September 15 to October 15, 2008, for Hispanic Heritage Month and in March 2009 for Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. The &quot;Americans in Focus&quot; vignettes and the companion sub-site on the Fox Sports website were discontinued in April 2009.

<doc id="77816" wikidata="Q199612" url="?curid=77816" title="Pope Vitalian">
<text>Pope Vitalian (; died 27 January 672) was the bishop of Rome from 30 July 657 to his death in 672. His pontificate was marked by the dispute between the papacy and the imperial government in Constantinople over Monothelitism, which Rome condemned. Vitalian tried to resolve the dispute and had a conciliatory relationship with Emperor Constans II, who visited him in Rome and gave him gifts. Vitalian&#x27;s pontificate also saw the secession of the Archbishopric of Ravenna from the papal authority.

==Election==
Vitalian was born in Segni, Lazio, the son of Anastasius. After the death of Eugene I on 2 or 3 June 657, Vitalian was elected to succeed him. He was consecrated as pope on 30 July, keeping his baptismal name.

==Pontificate==
===Monothelitism===
Like Eugene, Vitalian tried to restore the connection with Constantinople by making friendly advances to Emperor Constans II and to prepare the way for the settlement of the Monothelite controversy. He sent letters (synodica) announcing his elevation to the emperor and to Patriarch Peter of Constantinople, who was inclined to Monothelitism. The emperor confirmed the privileges of the Holy See as head of the Church in the West and sent to Rome a codex of the Gospels in a cover of gold richly ornamented with precious stones as a good-will gesture.

Patriarch Peter also replied, although his answer was somewhat noncommittal as to Monothelitism, a belief he defended. In his letter, he gave the impression of being in accord with the pope, whose letter to Peter had expounded the Catholic faith. Thus ecclesiastical intercourse between Rome and Constantinople was restored, but the mutual reserve over the dogmatic question of Monothelitism remained. Vitalian&#x27;s name was entered on the diptychs of the churches in Byzantium—the only name of a pope so entered between the pontificate of Honorius I (d. 638) and the Sixth Ecumenical Council of 680–81. The inclusion of Vitalian&#x27;s name on the diptych was seen by some as being too conciliatory towards heresy, but that charge was unfounded.

Vitalian showed reciprocity toward Constans when the latter came to Rome in 663 to spend twelve days there during a campaign against the Lombards. On 5 July, the pope and members of the Roman clergy met the emperor at the sixth milestone and accompanied him to St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, where the emperor offered gifts. The following Sunday, Constans went in state to St. Peter&#x27;s, offered a pallium wrought with gold, and was present during the Mass celebrated by the pope. The emperor dined with the pope on the following Saturday, attended Mass again on Sunday at St. Peter&#x27;s, and after Mass took leave of the pope. On his departure Constans removed a large number of bronze artworks, including the bronze tiles from the roof of the Pantheon, which had been dedicated to Christian worship.

Constans then moved on to Sicily, oppressed the population, and was assassinated at Syracuse in 668. Vitalian supported Constans&#x27; son Constantine IV against the usurper Mezezius and thus helped him attain the throne. As Constantine had no desire to maintain the Monothelite decree of his father, Vitalian made use of this inclination to take a more decided stand against Monothelitism and to win the emperor over to orthodoxy. In this latter attempt, however, he did not succeed. The Monothelite Patriarch Theodore I of Constantinople removed Vitalian&#x27;s name from the diptychs. It was not until the Sixth Ecumenical Council (681) that Monothelitism was suppressed and Vitalian&#x27;s name was replaced on the diptychs of the churches in Byzantium.

===Western Church relations===
Pope Vitalian was successful in improving relations with England, where the Anglo-Saxon and British clergies were divided regarding various ecclesiastical customs. At the Synod of Whitby, King Oswy of Northumbria accepted Roman practices regarding the keeping of Easter and the shape of the tonsure. Vitalian sent a highly educated monk, Theodore of Tarsus, who understood both Latin and Greek, to be archbishop of Canterbury.

The archiepiscopal See of Ravenna reported directly to Rome. Archbishop Maurus (644–71) sought to end this dependence and make his see autocephalous. When Pope Vitalian called upon him to justify his theological views, Maurus refused to obey and declared himself independent of Rome, initiating a schism. The pope excommunicated him, but Maurus did not submit and excommunicated Vitalian in return. Emperor Constans II sided with the archbishop and issued an edict removing the archbishop of Ravenna from the patriarchal jurisdiction of Rome. He ordained that the former should receive the pallium from the emperor. The successor of Maurus, Reparatus, was consecrated in 671. It was not until the pontificate of Leo II (682–83) that the independence of the See of Ravenna was suppressed.

===Authority over Eastern Church===
Vitalian played a role in exonerating a bishop of the Eastern Church. Bishop John of Lappa had been deposed by a synod under the presidency of Metropolitan Paul. John appealed to the pope and was imprisoned by Paul for so doing. He escaped, however, and went to Rome, where Vitalian held a synod in December 667 to investigate the matter and pronounced John guiltless. He then wrote to Paul demanding the restoration of John to his diocese and the return of the monasteries which had been unjustly taken from him. At the same time the pope directed the metropolitan to remove two deacons who had each married after consecration.

==Death and legacy==

Vitalian died on 27 January 672 and was succeeded by Adeodatus II. He is venerated as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church and Roman Catholic Church, with his feast day being celebrated each year on 23 July and 27 January respectively. The introduction of church organ music is traditionally believed to date from the time of Vitalian&#x27;s papacy.

<doc id="77819" wikidata="Q41253" url="?curid=77819" title="Movie theater">
<text>A movie theater (American English) or cinema (Commonwealth English), also known as a movie house, cinema hall, picture house, picture theater, the pictures, or simply theater, is a business that contains auditoriums for viewing films for public entertainment. Most are commercial operations catering to the general public, who attend by purchasing tickets.

The film is projected with a movie projector onto a large projection screen at the front of the auditorium while the dialogue, sounds and music are played through a number of wall-mounted speakers. Since the 1970s, subwoofers have been used for low-pitched sounds. Since the 2010s, the majority of movie theaters have been equipped for digital cinema projection, removing the need to create and transport a physical film print on a heavy reel.

A great variety of films are shown at cinemas, ranging from animated films to blockbusters to documentaries. The smallest movie theaters have a single viewing room with a single screen. In the 2010s, most movie theaters had multiple screens. The largest theater complexes, which are called multiplexes—a concept developed in Canada in the 1950s—have up to thirty screens. The audience members often sit on padded seats, which in most theaters are set on a sloped floor, with the highest part at the rear of the theater. Movie theaters often sell soft drinks, popcorn and candy, and some theaters sell hot fast food. In some jurisdictions, movie theaters can be licensed to sell alcoholic drinks.

== Terminology ==
 
A movie theater is usually called cinema in Anglophone countries outside North America. Other terms for the venue include movie house, film house, film theater, or picture house. In the US, &quot;theater&quot; has long been the preferred spelling, while in the UK, Australia, Canada, and elsewhere it is &quot;theatre&quot;.
However, some US theaters opt to use the British spelling in their own names, a practice supported by the National Association of Theatre Owners, while apart from Anglophone North America most English-speaking countries use the term &quot;cinema&quot; , alternatively spelled and pronounced &quot;kinema&quot; . The latter terms, as well as their derivative adjectives &quot;cinematic&quot; and &quot;kinematic&quot;, ultimately derive from Greek κίνημα, κινήματος (&quot;kinema&quot;, &quot;kinematos&quot;)—&quot;movement, motion&quot;. The word &quot;cinema&quot; is borrowed from the French &quot;cinéma&quot;, an abbreviation of &quot;cinématographe&quot;, a term coined by the Lumière brothers in the 1890s, from Ancient Greek meaning &quot;recording movement&quot;. Apart from the usage discussed in this article, the word is also used to refer to the film industry, the overall art form; or filmmaking. In the countries where &quot;cinema&quot; is used to refer to the venue, the word &quot;theatre&quot; is usually reserved for live performance venues.

The etymology of the term &quot;movie theater&quot; involves the term &quot;movie&quot;, which is a &quot;shortened form of moving picture in the cinematographic sense&quot; that was first used in 1896 and &quot;theater&quot;, which originated in the &quot;...late 14c., [meaning an] open air place in ancient times for viewing spectacles and plays&quot;. The term &quot;theater&quot; comes from the Old French word &quot;theatre&quot;, from the 12th century and &quot;...directly from Latin theatrum [which meant] &#x27;play-house, theater; stage; spectators in a theater&#x27;&quot;, which in turn came from the Greek word &quot;theatron&quot;, which meant &quot;theater; the people in the theater; a show, a spectacle&quot;, [or] literally &quot;place for viewing&quot;. The use of the word &quot;theatre&quot; to mean a &quot;building where plays are shown&quot; dates from the 1570s in the English language.

Colloquial expressions, mostly applied to motion pictures and motion picture theaters collectively, include &quot;the silver screen&quot; (formerly sometimes &quot;sheet&quot;) and &quot;the big screen&quot; (contrasted with the smaller screen of a television set). Specific to North American term is &quot;the movies&quot;, while specific terms in the UK are &quot;the pictures&quot;, &quot;the flicks&quot;, and for the facility itself &quot;the flea pit&quot; (or &quot;fleapit&quot;). A &quot;screening room&quot; is a small theater, often a private one, such as for the use of those involved in the production of motion pictures or in a large private residence.

==History==
===Precursors===
Movie theatres stand in a long tradition of theaters that could house all kinds of entertainment. Some forms of theatrical entertainment would involve the screening of moving images and can be regarded as precursors of film.

In 1799, Étienne-Gaspard &quot;Robertson&quot; Robert moved his Phantasmagorie show to an abandoned cloister near the Place Vendôme in Paris. The eerie surroundings, with a graveyard and ruins, formed an ideal location for his ghostraising spectacle.

When it opened in 1838, The Royal Polytechnic Institution in London became a very popular and influential venue with all kinds of magic lantern shows as an important part of its program. At the main theatre, with 500 seats, lanternists would make good use of a battery of six large lanterns running on tracked tables to project the finely detailed images of extra large slides on the 648 square feet screen. The magic lantern was used to illustrate lectures, concerts, pantomimes and other forms of theatre. Popular magic lantern presentations included phantasmagoria, mechanical slides, Henry Langdon Childe&#x27;s dissolving views and his chromatrope.

The earliest known public screening of projected stroboscopic animation was presented by Austrian magician Ludwig Döbler on 15 January 1847 at the Josephstadt Theatre in Vienna, with his patented Phantaskop. The animated spectacle was part of a well-received show that sold out in several European cities during a tour that lasted until the spring of 1848.

The famous Parisian entertainment venue Le Chat Noir opened in 1881 and is remembered for its shadow plays, renewing the popularity of such shows in France.

===Earliest motion picture screening venues===
The earliest public film screenings took place in existing (vaudeville) theatres and other venues that could be darkened and comfortably house an audience.

Émile Reynaud screened his &quot;Pantomimes Lumineuses&quot; animated movies from 28 October 1892 to March 1900 at the Musée Grévin in Paris, with his Théâtre Optique system. He gave over 12,800 shows to a total of over 500,000 visitors, with programs including &quot;Pauvre Pierrot&quot; and &quot;Autour d&#x27;une cabine&quot;.

Thomas Edison initially believed film screening would not be as viable commercially as presenting films in peep boxes, hence the film apparatus that his company would first exploit became the kinetoscope. A few public demonstrations occurred since 9 May 1893, before a first public Kinetoscope parlor was opened on 14 April 1894, by the Holland Bros. in New York City at 1155 Broadway, on the corner of 27th Street. This can be regarded as the first commercial motion picture house. The venue had ten machines, set up in parallel rows of five, each showing a different movie. For 25 cents a viewer could see all the films in either row; half a dollar gave access to the entire bill.

The Eidoloscope, devised by Eugene Augustin Lauste for the Latham family, was demonstrated for members of the press on 21 April 1895 and opened to the paying public on 20 May, in a lower Broadway store with films of the Griffo-Barnett prize boxing fight, taken from Madison Square Garden&#x27;s roof on 4 May.

Max Skladanowsky and his brother Emil demonstrated their motion pictures with the Bioscop in July 1895 at the Gasthaus Sello in Pankow (Berlin). This venue was later, at least since 1918, exploited as the full-time movie theatre Pankower Lichtspiele and between 1925 and 1994 as Tivoli. The first certain commercial screenings by the Skladanowsky brothers took place at the Wintergarten in Berlin from 1 to 31 November 1895.

The first commercial, public screening of films made with Louis and Auguste Lumière&#x27;s Cinématographe took place in the basement of Salon Indien du Grand Café in Paris on 28 December 1895.

===Early dedicated movie theatres===

During the first decade of motion pictures, the demand for movies, the amount of new productions, and the average runtime of movies, kept increasing, and at some stage it was viable to have theaters that would no longer program live acts, but only movies.

The first building built for the dedicated purpose of showing motion pictures was built to demonstrate the Phantoscope, a device created by Jenkins &amp; Armat, as part of The Cotton State Exposition on September 25, 1895 in Atlanta, GA. This is arguably the first cinema in the world.

Claimants for the title of the earliest movie theatre include the Eden Theater in La Ciotat, where &quot;L&#x27;Arrivée d&#x27;un train en gare de La Ciotat&quot; was screened on 21 March 1899. The theatre closed in 1995 but re-opened in 2013.

L&#x27;Idéal Cinéma in Aniche (France), built in 1901 as l&#x27;Hôtel du Syndicat CGT, showed its first film on 23 November 1905. The cinema was closed in 1977 and the building was demolished in 1993. The &quot;Centre Culturel Claude Berri&quot; was built in 1995; it integrates a new movie theater (the Idéal Cinéma Jacques Tati).

In the United States, many small and simple theaters were set up, usually in converted storefronts. They typically charged five cents for admission, and thus became known as nickelodeons. This type of theatre flourished from about 1905 to circa 1915.

The Korsør Biograf Teater, in Korsør, Denmark, opened in August 1908 and is the oldest known movie theater still in continuous operation.
==Design==


Traditionally a movie theater, like a stage theater, consists of a single auditorium with rows of comfortable padded seats, as well as a foyer area containing a box office for buying tickets. Movie theaters also often have a concession stand for buying snacks and drinks within the theater&#x27;s lobby. Other features included are film posters, arcade games and washrooms. Stage theaters are sometimes converted into movie theaters by placing a screen in front of the stage and adding a projector; this conversion may be permanent, or temporary for purposes such as showing arthouse fare to an audience accustomed to plays. The familiar characteristics of relatively low admission and open seating can be traced to Samuel Roxy Rothafel, an early movie theater impresario. Many of these early theaters contain a balcony, an elevated level across the auditorium above the theater&#x27;s rearmost seats. The rearward main floor &quot;loge&quot; seats were sometimes larger, softer, and more widely spaced and sold for a higher price. In conventional low pitch viewing floors, the preferred seating arrangement is to use staggered rows. While a less efficient use of floor space this allows a somewhat improved sight line between the patrons seated in the next row toward the screen, provided they do not lean toward one another.

&quot;Stadium seating&quot;, popular in modern multiplexes, actually dates back to the 1920s. The 1922 Princess Theatre in Honolulu, Hawaii featured &quot;stadium seating&quot;, sharply raked rows of seats extending from in front of the screen back towards the ceiling. It gives patrons a clear sight line over the heads of those seated in front of them. Modern &quot;stadium seating&quot; was utilized in IMAX theaters, which have very tall screens, beginning in the early 1970s.

Rows of seats are divided by one or more aisles so that there are seldom more than 20 seats in a row. This allows easier access to seating, as the space between rows is very narrow. Depending on the angle of rake of the seats, the aisles have steps. In older theaters, aisle lights were often built into the end seats of each row to help patrons find their way in the dark. Since the advent of stadium theaters with stepped aisles, each step in the aisles may be outlined with small lights to prevent patrons from tripping in the darkened theater. In movie theaters, the auditorium may also have lights that go to a low level, when the movie is going to begin. Theaters often have booster seats for children and other people of short stature to place on the seats to allow them to sit higher, for a better view. Many modern theaters have accessible seating areas for patrons in wheelchairs. See also luxury screens below.
===Multiplexes and megaplexes===

Canada was the first country in the world to have a two-screen theater. The Elgin Theatre in Ottawa, Ontario became the first venue to offer two film programs on different screens in 1957 when Canadian theater-owner Nat Taylor converted the dual screen theater into one capable of showing two different movies simultaneously. Taylor is credited by Canadian sources as the inventor of the multiplex or cineplex; he later founded the Cineplex Odeon Corporation, opening the 18-screen Toronto Eaton Centre Cineplex, the world&#x27;s largest at the time, in Toronto, Ontario. In the United States, Stanley Durwood of American Multi-Cinema (now AMC Theatres) is credited as pioneering the &quot;multiplex&quot; in 1963 after realizing that he could operate several attached auditoriums with the same staff needed for one through careful management of the start times for each movie. Ward Parkway Center in Kansas City, Missouri had the first multiplex cinema in the United States.

Since the 1960s, multiple-screen theaters have become the norm, and many existing venues have been retrofitted so that they have multiple auditoriums. A single foyer area is shared among them. In the 1970s, many large 1920s movie palaces were converted into multiple screen venues by dividing their large auditoriums, and sometimes even the stage space, into smaller theaters. Because of their size, and amenities like plush seating and extensive food/beverage service, multiplexes and megaplexes draw from a larger geographic area than smaller theaters. As a rule of thumb, they pull audiences from an eight to 12-mile radius, versus a three to five-mile radius for smaller theaters (though the size of this radius depends on population density). As a result, the customer geography area of multiplexes and megaplexes typically overlaps with smaller theaters, which face threat of having their audience siphoned by bigger theaters that cut a wider swath in the movie-going landscape.

In most markets, nearly all single-screen theaters (sometimes referred to as a &quot;Uniplex&quot;) have gone out of business; the ones remaining are generally used for arthouse films, e.g. the Crest Theatre in downtown Sacramento, California, small-scale productions, film festivals or other presentations. Because of the late development of multiplexes, the term &quot;cinema&quot; or &quot;theater&quot; may refer either to the whole complex or a single auditorium, and sometimes &quot;screen&quot; is used to refer to an auditorium. A popular film may be shown on multiple screens at the same multiplex, which reduces the choice of other films but offers more choice of viewing times or a greater number of seats to accommodate patrons. Two or three screens may be created by dividing up an existing cinema (as Durwood did with his Roxy in 1964), but newly built multiplexes usually have at least six to eight screens, and often as many as twelve, fourteen, sixteen or even eighteen.

Although definitions vary, a large multiplex with 20 or more screens is usually called a &quot;megaplex&quot;. However, in the United Kingdom, this was a brand name for Virgin Cinema (later UGC). The first megaplex is generally considered to be the Kinepolis in Brussels, Belgium, which opened in 1988 with 25 screens and a seating capacity of 7,500. The first theater in the U.S. built from the ground up as a megaplex was the AMC Grand 24 in Dallas, Texas, which opened in May 1995, while the first megaplex in the U.S.-based on an expansion of an existing facility was Studio 28 in Grand Rapids, Michigan, which reopened in November 1988 with 20 screens and a seating capacity of 6,000.

===Drive-in===
A drive-in movie theater is an outdoor parking area with a screen—sometimes an inflatable screen—at one end and a projection booth at the other. Moviegoers drive into the parking spaces which are sometimes sloped upwards at the front to give a more direct view of the movie screen. Movies are usually viewed through the car windscreen (windshield) although some people prefer to sit on the bonnet (hood) of the car. Some may also sit in the trunk (back) of their car if space permits. Sound is either provided through portable loudspeakers located by each parking space, or is broadcast on an FM radio frequency, to be played through the car&#x27;s stereo system. Because of their outdoor nature, drive-ins usually only operate seasonally, and after sunset. Drive-in movie theaters are mainly found in the United States, where they were especially popular in the 1950s and 1960s. Once numbering in the thousands, about 300 remain in the U.S. today. In some cases, multiplex or megaplex theaters were built on the sites of former drive-in theaters.

===Other venues===
Some outdoor movie theaters are just grassy areas where the audience sits upon chairs, blankets or even in hot tubs, and watch the movie on a temporary screen, or even the wall of a building. Colleges and universities have often sponsored movie screenings in lecture halls. The formats of these screenings include 35 mm, 16 mm, DVD, VHS, and even 70 mm in rare cases. Some alternative methods of showing movies have been popular in the past. In the 1980s the introduction of VHS cassettes made possible video-salons, small rooms where visitors viewed movies on a large TV. These establishments were especially popular in the Soviet Union, where official distribution companies were slow to adapt to changing demand, and so movie theaters could not show popular Hollywood and Asian films.

In 1967, the British government launched seven custom-built mobile cinema units for use as part of the Ministry of Technology campaign to raise standards. Using a very futuristic look, these 27-seat cinema vehicles were designed to attract attention. They were built on a Bedford SB3 chassis with a custom Coventry Steel Caravan extruded aluminum body. Movies are also commonly shown on airliners in flight, using large screens in each cabin or smaller screens for each group of rows or each individual seat; the airline company sometimes charges a fee for the headphones needed to hear the movie&#x27;s sound. In a similar fashion, movies are sometimes also shown on trains, such as the Auto Train.

The smallest purpose-built cinema is the Cabiria Cine-Cafe which measures and has a seating capacity of 18. It was built by Renata Carneiro Agostinho da Silva (Brazil) in Brasília DF, Brazil in 2008. It is mentioned in the 2010 &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;. The World&#x27;s smallest solar-powered mobile cinema is Sol Cinema in the UK. Touring since 2010 the cinema is actually a converted 1972 caravan. It seats 8–10 at a time. In 2015 it featured in a Lenovo advert for the launch of a new tablet. The Bell Museum of Natural History in Minneapolis, Minnesota has recently begun summer &quot;bike-ins&quot;, inviting only pedestrians or people on bicycles onto the grounds for both live music and movies. In various Canadian cities, including Toronto, Calgary, Ottawa and Halifax, al-fresco movies projected on the walls of buildings or temporarily erected screens in parks operate during the Summer and cater to a pedestrian audience. The New Parkway Museum in Oakland, California replaces general seating with couches and coffee tables, as well as having a full restaurant menu instead of general movie theater concessions such as popcorn or candy.

In certain countries, there are also Bed Cinemas where the audience sits or lays in beds instead of chairs.

===3D===

3D film is a system of presenting film images so that they appear to the viewer to be three-dimensional. Visitors usually borrow or keep special glasses to wear while watching the movie. Depending on the system used, these are typically polarized glasses. Three-dimensional movies use two images channeled, respectively, to the right and left eyes to simulate depth by using 3D glasses with red and blue lenses (anaglyph), polarized (linear and circular), and other techniques. 3D glasses deliver the proper image to the proper eye and make the image appear to &quot;pop-out&quot; at the viewer and even follow the viewer when he/she moves so viewers relatively see the same image.

The earliest 3D movies were presented in the 1920s. There have been several prior &quot;waves&quot; of 3D movie distribution, most notably in the 1950s when they were promoted as a way to offer audiences something that they could not see at home on television. Still the process faded quickly and as yet has never been more than a periodic novelty in movie presentation. The &quot;golden era&quot; of 3D film began in the early 1950s with the release of the first color stereoscopic feature, &quot;Bwana Devil&quot;. The film starred Robert Stack, Barbara Britton and Nigel Bruce. James Mage was an early pioneer in the 3D craze. Using his 16 mm 3D Bolex system, he premiered his &quot;Triorama&quot; program in February 1953 with his four shorts: &quot;Sunday In Stereo&quot;, &quot;Indian Summer&quot;, &quot;American Life&quot;, and &quot;This is Bolex Stereo&quot;. 1953 saw two groundbreaking features in 3D: Columbia&#x27;s &quot;Man in the Dark&quot; and Warner Bros. &quot;House of Wax&quot;, the first 3D feature with stereophonic sound. For many years, most 3D movies were shown in amusement parks and even &quot;4D&quot; techniques have been used when certain effects such as spraying of water, movement of seats, and other effects are used to simulate actions seen on the screen. The first decline in the theatrical 3D craze started in August and September 1953.

In 2009, movie exhibitors became more interested in 3D film. The number of 3D screens in theaters is increasing. The RealD company expects 15,000 screens worldwide in 2010. The availability of 3D movies encourages exhibitors to adopt digital cinema and provides a way for theaters to compete with home theaters. One incentive for theaters to show 3D films is that although ticket sales have declined, revenues from 3D tickets have grown. In the 2010s, 3D films became popular again. The IMAX 3D system and digital 3D systems are used (the latter is used in the animated movies of Disney/Pixar).
The RealD 3D system works by using a single digital projector that swaps back and forth between the images for eyes. A filter is placed in front of the projector that changes the polarization of the light coming from the projector. A silver screen is used to reflect this light back at the audience and reduce loss of brightness. There are four other systems available: Volfoni, Master Image, XpanD and Dolby 3D.

When a system is used that requires inexpensive 3D glasses, they can sometimes be kept by the patron. Most theaters have a fixed cost for 3D, while others charge for the glasses, but the latter is uncommon (at least in the United States). For example, in Pathé theaters in the Netherlands the extra fee for watching a 3D film consists of a fixed fee of €1.50, and an optional fee of €1 for the glasses. Holders of the &quot;Pathé Unlimited Gold&quot; pass (see also below) are supposed to bring along their own glasses; one pair, supplied yearly, more robust than the regular type, is included in the price.

===IMAX===
IMAX is a system using 70 mm film with more than ten times the frame size of a 35 mm film. IMAX theaters use an oversized screen as well as special projectors. The first permanent IMAX theater was at Ontario Place in Toronto, Canada. Until 2016, visitors to the IMAX cinema attached to the National Science and Media Museum in Bradford, West Yorkshire, England, United Kingdom, could observe the IMAX projection booth via a glass rear wall and watch the large format films being loaded and projected. The largest permanent IMAX cinema screen measures and was achieved by Traumplast Leonberg (Germany) in Leonberg, Germany, verified on 6 December 2022.

IMAX also refers to a digital cinema format that uses dual 2K resolution projectors and a screen with a 1.90:1 aspect ratio; this system is designed primarily for use in retrofitted multiplexes, using screens significantly smaller than those normally associated with IMAX. In 2015, IMAX introduced an updated &quot;IMAX with Laser&quot; format, using 4K resolution laser projectors.

===Premium large format (PLF)===
The term &quot;premium large format&quot; (PLF) emerged in the mid-2010s to refer to auditoriums with high-end amenities. PLF does not refer to a single format in general, but combinations of non-proprietary amenities such as larger &quot;wall-to-wall&quot; screens, 4K projectors, 7.1 and/or positional surround sound systems (including Dolby Atmos), and higher-quality seating (such as leather recliners). Cinemas typically brand PLF auditoriums with chain-specific trademarks, such as &quot;Prime&quot; (AMC), &quot;Grand Screen” (B&amp;B Theatres), &quot;BTX&quot; (Bow Tie), &quot;Superscreen&quot; (Cineworld), &quot;BigD&quot; (Carmike, now owned by AMC), &quot;UltraAVX&quot; (Cineplex), &quot;Macro XE&quot; (Cinépolis), &quot;XD&quot; (Cinemark), &quot;BigPix&quot; (INOX), &quot;Laser Ultra&quot; (Kinepolis and Landmark Cinemas), &quot;RPX&quot; (Regal Cinemas), &quot;Superscreen DLX&quot;/&quot;Ultrascreen DLX&quot; (Marcus), &quot;Titan&quot; (Reading Cinemas), &quot;VueXtreme&quot; (Vue International), and &quot;X-land&quot; (Wanda Cinemas).

PLFs compete primarily with formats such as digital IMAX; the use of common &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; components and an in-house brand removes the need to pay licensing fees to a third-party for a proprietary large format. Although the term is synonymous with exhibitor-specific brands, some PLFs are franchised. Dolby franchises Dolby Cinema, which is based on technologies such as Atmos and Dolby Vision. CJ CGV franchises the 4DX and ScreenX formats.

=== Motion controlled seating ===
In some theaters, seating can be dynamically moved via haptic motion technology called D-BOX.

In digital cinema, D-BOX codes for motion control are stored in the Digital Cinema Package for the film. Control data is encoded in a monoaural WAV file on Sound Track channel 13, labelled as &quot;Motion Data&quot;. Motion Data tracks are unencrypted and not watermarked.

==Programming==

Movie theaters may be classified by the type of movies they show or when in a film&#x27;s release process they are shown:
* &quot;First-run theater&quot;: A theater that runs primarily mainstream film fare from the major film companies and distributors, during the initial new release period of each film.
* &quot;Second-run&quot; or &quot;discount theater&quot;: A theater that runs films that have already shown in the first-run theaters and presented at a lower ticket price. (These are sometimes known as dollar theaters or &quot;cheap seats&quot;.) This form of cinema is diminishing in viability owing to the increasingly shortened intervals before the films&#x27; home video release, called the &quot;video window&quot;.
* &quot;Repertoire/repertory theater&quot; or &quot;arthouse&quot;: A theater that presents more alternative and art films as well as second-run and classic films (often known as an &quot;independent cinema&quot; in the UK).
* An &quot;adult movie theater&quot; or &quot;sex theater&quot; specializes in showing pornographic movies. Such movies are rarely shown in other theaters. See also Golden Age of Porn. Since the widespread availability of pornographic films for home viewing on VHS in the 1980s and 1990s, the DVD in the 1990s, and the Blu-ray disc in the 2000s, there are far fewer adult movie theaters.
* IMAX theaters can show conventional movies, but the major benefits of the IMAX system are only available when showing movies filmed using it. While a few mainstream feature films have been produced in IMAX, IMAX movies are often documentaries featuring natural scenery, and may be limited to the 45-minute length of a single reel of IMAX film.

==Presentation==
Usually in the 2020s, an admission is for one feature film. Sometimes two feature films are sold as one admission (double feature), with a break in between. Separate admission for a short subject is rare; it is either an extra before a feature film or part of a series of short films sold as one admission (this mainly occurs at film festivals). (See also anthology film.) In the early decades of &quot;talkie&quot; films, many movie theaters presented a number of shorter items in addition to the feature film. This might include a newsreel, live-action comedy short films, documentary short films, musical short films, or cartoon shorts (many classic cartoons series such as the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; shorts were created for this purpose). Examples of this kind of programming are available on certain DVD releases of two of the most famous films starring Errol Flynn as a special feature arrangement designed to recreate that kind of filmgoing experience while the PBS series, &quot;Matinee at the Bijou&quot;, presented the equivalent content. Some theaters ran on &quot;continuous showings&quot;, where the same items would repeat throughout the day, with patrons arriving and departing at any time rather than having distinct entrance and exit cycles. Newsreels gradually became obsolete by the 1960s with the rise of television news, and most material now shown prior to a feature film is of a commercial or promotional nature (which usually include &quot;trailers&quot;, which are advertisements for films and commercials for other consumer products or services).

A typical modern theater presents commercial advertising shorts, then movie trailers, and then the feature film. Advertised start times are usually for the entire program or session, not the feature itself; thus people who want to avoid commercials and trailers would opt to enter later. This is easiest and causes the least inconvenience when it is not crowded or one is not very choosy about where one wants to sit. If one has a ticket for a specific seat (see below) one is formally assured of that, but it is still inconvenient and disturbing to find and claim it during the commercials and trailers, unless it is near an aisle. Some movie theaters have some kind of break during the presentation, particularly for very long films. There may also be a break between the introductory material and the feature. Some countries such as the Netherlands have a tradition of incorporating an intermission in regular feature presentations, though many theaters have now abandoned that tradition, while in North America, this is very rare and usually limited to special circumstances involving extremely long movies. During the closing credits many people leave, but some stay until the end. Usually the lights are switched on after the credits, sometimes already during them. Some films show mid-credits scenes while the credits are rolling, which in comedy films are often bloopers and outtakes, or post-credits scenes, which typically set up the audience for a sequel.

Until the multiplex era, prior to showtime, the screen in some theaters would be covered by a curtain, in the style of a theater for a play. The curtain would be drawn for the feature. It is common practice in Australia for the curtain to cover part of the screen during advertising and trailers, then be fully drawn to reveal the full width of the screen for the main feature. Some theaters, lacking a curtain, filled the screen with slides of some form of abstract art prior to the start of the movie. Currently, in multiplexes, theater chains often feature a continuous slideshow between showings featuring a loop of movie trivia, promotional material for the theater chains (such as encouraging patrons to purchase drinks, snacks and popcorn, gift vouchers and group rates, or other foyer retail offers), or advertising for local and national businesses. Advertisements for Fandango and other convenient methods of purchasing tickets is often shown. Also prior to showing the film, reminders, in varying forms would be shown concerning theater etiquette (no smoking, no talking, no littering, removing crying babies, etc.) and in recent years, added reminders to silence mobile phones as well as warning concerning movie piracy with camcorders (&quot;camming&quot;).

Some well-equipped theaters have &quot;interlock&quot; projectors which allow two or more projectors and sound units to be run in unison by connecting them electronically or mechanically. This set up can be used to project two prints in sync (for dual-projector 3-D) or to &quot;interlock&quot; one or more sound tracks to a single film. Sound interlocks were used for stereophonic sound systems before the advent of magnetic film prints. Fantasound (developed by RCA in 1940 for Disney&#x27;s Fantasia) was an early interlock system. Likewise, early stereophonic films such as &quot;This Is Cinerama&quot; and &quot;House of Wax&quot; utilized a separate, magnetic oxide-coated film to reproduce up to six or more tracks of stereophonic sound. Datasat Digital Entertainment, purchaser of DTS&#x27;s cinema division in May 2008, uses a time code printed on and read off of the film to synchronize with a CD-ROM in the sound track, allowing multi-channel soundtracks or foreign language tracks. This is not considered a projector interlock, however.

This practice is most common with blockbuster movies. Muvico Theaters, Regal Cinemas, Pacific Theatres and AMC Theatres are some theaters that interlock films.

===Live broadcasting to movie theaters===
Sometimes movie theaters provide digital projection of a live broadcast of an opera, concert, or other performance or event. For example, there are regular live broadcasts to movie theaters of Metropolitan Opera performances, with additionally limited repeat showings. Admission prices are often more than twice the regular movie theater admission prices.

== Accessibility ==
Several accessibility features can be integrated into a movie theater.

=== Alternate audio ===
A Hearing Impaired (HI) audio track is designed for people who are hearing-impaired to better hear dialog. Audio description is narration for people who are blind or visually impaired. Moviegoers can wear headphones which play one of these alternate audio tracks synchronized with the film. In digital cinema, Hearing Impaired audio is stored in the Digital Cinema Package (DCP) on Sound Track channel 7, and audio description is stored as &quot;Visually Impaired-Native&quot; (VI-N) audio on Sound Track channel 8.

=== Sign Language Video ===
Sign language can be displayed on a second screen device synchronized with the film. In Brazil, Libras accessibility requirements mandate availability of Brazilian Sign Language for films shown in Brazilian movie theaters. This video is stored in the DCP as a Sign Language Video track on Sound Track channel 15.

==Pricing and admission==
In order to obtain admission to a movie theater, the prospective theater-goer must usually purchase a ticket from the box office, which may be for an arbitrary seat (&quot;open&quot; or &quot;free&quot; seating, first-come, first-served) or for a specific one (allocated seating). As of 2015, some theaters sell tickets online or at automated kiosks in the theater lobby. Movie theaters in North America generally have open seating. Cinemas in Europe can have free seating or numbered seating. Some theaters in Mexico offer numbered seating, in particular, Cinepolis VIP. In the case of numbered seating systems the attendee can often pick seats from a video screen. Sometimes the attendee cannot see the screen and has to make a choice based on a verbal description of the still available seats. In the case of free seats, already seated customers may be asked by staff to move one or more places for the benefit of an arriving couple or group wanting to sit together.

For 2013, the average price for a movie ticket in the United States was $8.13. The price of a ticket may be discounted during off-peak times e.g. for , and higher at busy times, typically evenings and weekends. In Australia, Canada and New Zealand, when this practice is used, it is traditional to offer the lower prices for Tuesday for all showings, one of the slowest days of the week in the movie theater business, which has led to the nickname &quot;cheap Tuesday&quot;. Sometimes tickets are cheaper on Monday, or on Sunday morning. Almost all movie theaters employ economic price discrimination: tickets for youth, students, and seniors are typically cheaper. Large theater chains, such as AMC Theatres, also own smaller theaters that show &quot;second runs&quot; of popular films, at reduced ticket prices. Movie theaters in India and other developing countries employ price discrimination in seating arrangement: seats closer to the screen cost less, while the ones farthest from the screen cost more.
In the United States, many movie theater chains sell discounted passes, which can be exchanged for tickets to regular showings. Some passes provide substantial discounts from the price of regular admission, especially if they carry restrictions. Common restrictions include a waiting period after a movie&#x27;s release before the pass can be exchanged for a ticket or specific theaters where a pass is ineligible for admission.

Some movie theaters and chains sell monthly passes for unlimited entrance to regular showings. Cinemas in Thailand have a restriction of one viewing per movie. The increasing number of 3D movies, for which an additional fee is required, somewhat undermines the concept of unlimited entrance to regular showings, in particular if no 2D version is screened, except in the cases where 3D is included. Some adult theaters sell a day pass, either as standard ticket, or as an option that costs a little more than a single admission. Also for some film festivals, a pass is sold for unlimited entrance. Discount theaters show films at a greatly discounted rate, however, the films shown are generally films that have already run for many weeks at regular theaters and thus are no longer a major draw, or films which flopped at the box office and thus have already been removed from showings at major theaters in order to free up screens for films that are a better box office draw.

===Luxury screens===

Some cinemas in city centers offer luxury seating with services like complimentary refills of soft drinks and popcorn, a bar serving beer, wine and liquor, reclining leather seats and service bells. Cinemas must have a liquor license to serve alcohol. The Vue Cinema and CGV Cinema chain is a good example of a large-scale offering of such a service, called &quot;Gold Class&quot; and similarly, ODEON, Britain&#x27;s largest cinema chain, and 21 Cineplex, Indonesia&#x27;s largest cinema chain, have gallery areas in some of their bigger cinemas where there is a separate foyer area with a bar and unlimited snacks.

===Age restrictions===
Admission to a movie may also be restricted by a motion picture rating system, typically due to depictions of sex, nudity or graphic violence. According to such systems, children or teenagers below a certain age may be forbidden access to theaters showing certain movies, or only admitted when accompanied by a parent or other adult. In some jurisdictions, a rating may legally impose these age restrictions on movie theaters. Where movie theaters do not have this legal obligation, they may enforce restrictions on their own. Accordingly, a movie theater may either not be allowed to program an unrated film, or voluntarily refrain from that.

===Revenue===

Movie studios/film distributors in the US traditionally drive hard bargains entitling them to as much as 100% of the gross ticket revenue during the first weeks (and then the balance changes in 10% increments in favor of exhibitors at intervals that vary from film to film). Film exhibition has seen a rise in its development with video consolidation as well as DVD sales, which over the past two decades is the biggest earner in revenue. According to The Contemporary Hollywood Film Industry, Philip Drake states that box office takings currently account for less than a quarter of total revenues and have become increasingly &quot;front-loaded&quot;, earning the majority of receipts in the opening two weeks of exhibition, meaning that films need to make an almost instant impact in order to avoid being dropped from screens by exhibitors. Essentially, if the film does not succeed in the first few weeks of its inception, it will most likely fail in its attempt to gain a sustainable amount of revenue and thus being taken out from movie theaters. Furthermore, higher-budget films on the &quot;opening weekend&quot;, or the three days, Friday to Sunday, can signify how much revenue it will bring in, not only to America, but as well as overseas. It may also determine the price in distribution windows through home video and television.

In Canada, the total operating revenue in the movie theater industry was $1.7 billion in 2012, an 8.4% increase from 2010. This increase was mainly the result of growth in box office and concession revenue. Combined, these accounted for 91.9% of total industry operating revenue. In the US, the &quot;...number of tickets sold fell nearly 11% between 2004 and 2013, according to the report, while box office revenue increased 17%&quot; due to increased ticket prices.

====New forms of competition====
One reason for the decline in ticket sales in the 2000s is that &quot;home-entertainment options [are] improving all the time— whether streamed movies and television, video games, or mobile apps—and studios releasing fewer movies&quot;, which means that &quot;people are less likely to head to their local multiplex&quot;. This decline is not something that is recent. It has been observed since the 1950s when television became widespread among working-class homes. As the years went on, home media became more popular, and the decline continued. This decline continues until this day. A Pew Media survey from 2006 found that the relationship between movies watched at home versus at the movie theater was in a five to one ratio and 75% of respondents said their preferred way of watching a movie was at home, versus 21% who said they preferred to go to a theater. In 2014, it was reported that the practice of releasing a film in theaters and via on-demand streaming on the same day (for selected films) and the rise in popularity of the Netflix streaming service has led to concerns in the movie theater industry. Another source of competition is television, which has &quot;...stolen a lot of cinema&#x27;s best tricks – like good production values and top tier actors – and brought them into people&#x27;s living rooms&quot;. Since the 2010s, one of the increasing sources of competition for movie theaters is the increasing ownership by people of home theater systems which can display high-resolution Blu-ray disks of movies on large, widescreen flat-screen TVs, with 5.1 surround sound and a powerful subwoofer for low-pitched sounds.

===Ticket price uniformity===

The relatively strong uniformity of movie ticket prices, particularly in the U.S., is a common economics puzzle, because conventional supply and demand theory would suggest higher prices for more popular and more expensive movies, and lower prices for an unpopular &quot;bomb&quot; or for a documentary with less audience appeal. Unlike seemingly similar forms of entertainment such as rock concerts, in which a popular performer&#x27;s tickets cost much more than an unpopular performer&#x27;s tickets, the demand for movies is very difficult to predict ahead of time. Indeed, some films with major stars, such as &quot;Gigli&quot; (which starred the then-supercouple of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez), have turned out to be box-office bombs, while low-budget films with unknown actors have become smash hits (e.g., &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;). The demand for films is usually determined from ticket sale statistics after the movie is already out. Uniform pricing is therefore a strategy to cope with unpredictable demand. Historical and cultural factors are sometimes also cited.

===Ticket check===
In some movie theater complexes, the theaters are arranged such that tickets are checked at the entrance into the entire plaza, rather than before each theater. At a theater with a sold-out show there is often an additional ticket check, to make sure that everybody with a ticket for that show can find a seat. The lobby may be before or after the ticket check.

==Controversies==

* Advertising: Some moviegoers complain about commercial advertising shorts played before films, arguing that their absence used to be one of the main advantages of going to a movie theater. Other critics such as Roger Ebert have expressed concerns that these advertisements, plus an excessive number of movie trailers, could lead to pressure to restrict the preferred length of the feature films themselves to facilitate playing schedules. So far, the theater companies have typically been highly resistant to these complaints, citing the need for the supplementary income. Some chains like Famous Players and AMC Theatres have compromised with the commercials restricted to being shown before the scheduled start time for the trailers and the feature film. Individual theaters within a chain also sometimes adopt this policy.
* Loudness: Another major recent concern is that the dramatic improvements in stereo sound systems and in subwoofer systems have led to cinemas playing the soundtracks of films at unacceptably high volume levels. Usually, the trailers are presented at a very high sound level, presumably to overcome the sounds of a busy crowd. The sound is not adjusted downward for a sparsely occupied theater. Volume is normally adjusted based on the projectionist&#x27;s judgment of a high or low attendance. The film is usually shown at a lower volume level than the trailers. In response to audience complaints, a manager at a Cinemark theater in California explained that the studios set trailer sound levels, not the theater.
* Copyright piracy: In recent years, cinemas have started to show warnings before the movie starts against using cameras and camcorders during the movie (camming). Some patrons record the movie in order to sell &quot;bootleg&quot; copies on the black market. These warnings threaten customers with being removed from the cinema and arrested by the police. Some theaters (including those with IMAX stadiums) have dogs at the doors to sniff recording smugglers. At particularly anticipated showings, theaters may employ night vision equipment to detect a working camera during a screening. In some jurisdictions this is illegal unless the practice has been announced to the public in advance.
* Crowd control: As movie theaters have grown into multiplexes and megaplexes, crowd control has become a major concern. An overcrowded megaplex can be rather unpleasant, and in an emergency can be extremely dangerous (indeed, &quot;shouting fire in a crowded theater&quot; is the standard example of the limits to free speech, because it could cause a deadly panic). Therefore, all major theater chains have implemented crowd control measures. The most well-known measure is the ubiquitous holdout line, which prevents ticket holders for the next showing of that weekend&#x27;s most popular movie from entering the building until their particular auditorium has been cleared out and cleaned. Since the 1980s, some theater chains (especially AMC Theatres) have developed a policy of co-locating their theaters in shopping centers (as opposed to the old practice of building stand-alone theaters). In some cases, lobbies and corridors cannot hold as many people as the auditoriums, thus making holdout lines necessary. In turn, ticket holders may be enticed to shop or eat while stuck outside in the holdout line. However, given the fact that rent is based on floor area, the practice of having a smaller lobby is somewhat understandable.

* Refunds: Most cinema companies issue refunds if there is a technical fault such as a power outage that stops people from seeing a movie. Refunds may be offered during the initial 30 minutes of the screening. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that some audience members walked out of Terrence Malick&#x27;s film &quot;Tree of Life&quot; and asked for refunds. At AMC theaters, &quot;...patrons who sat through the entire film and then decided they wanted their money back were out of luck, as AMC&#x27;s policy is to only offer refunds 30 minutes into a screening. The same goes for Landmark, an independent movie chain... whose policy states, &#x27;If a film is not what is expected… and the feature is viewed less than 30 minutes a refund can be processed for you at the box office.&#x27;&quot; 
* Snack prices: The price of soft drinks and candy at theaters is typically significantly higher than the cost of those items at any other place. Popcorn prices can also be exorbitant. It has been &quot;...estimated that movie theaters make an 85% profit at the concessions stand on overpriced soda, candy, nachos, hot dogs and, of course, popcorn. Movie-theater popcorn has been called one of America&#x27;s biggest rip-offs, with a retail price of nine times what it costs to make.&quot;

==Cinema and movie theater chains==

In Africa, Ster-Kinekor has the largest market share in South Africa. Nu Metro Cinemas is another cinema chain in South Africa.

In North America, the National Association of Theatre Owners (NATO) is the largest exhibition trade organization in the world. According to their figures, the top four chains represent almost half of the theater screens in North America. In Canada, Cineplex Cinemas is by far the largest player with 161 locations and 1,635 screens.

In the United States, the studios once controlled many theaters, but after the appearance of &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot;, Congress passed the Neely Anti-Block Booking Act, which eventually broke the link between the studios and the theaters. Now, the top three chains in the U.S. are Regal Cinemas, AMC Theatres and Cinemark Theatres. In 1995, Carmike was the largest chain in the United States- now, the major chains include AMC Theatres – 5,206 screens in 346 theaters, Cinemark Theatres – 4,457 screens in 334 theaters, Landmark Theatres – 220 screens in 54 theaters, Marcus Theatres – 681 screens in 53 theaters. National Amusements – 409 screens in 32 theaters and Regal Cinemas – 7,334 screens in 588 theaters. In 2015 the United States had a total of 40,547 screens. In Mexico, the major chains are Cinépolis and Cinemex.

In Asia, Wanda Cinemas is the largest exhibitor in China, with 2,700 screens in 311 theaters and with 18% of the screens in the country; another major Chinese chain is UA Cinemas. China had a total of 31,627 screens in 2015 and is expected to have almost 40,000 in 2016. Hong Kong has AMC Theatres. South Korea&#x27;s CJ CGV also has branches in China, Indonesia, Myanmar, Turkey, Vietnam, and the United States. In India, PVR Cinemas is a leading cinema operating a chain of 500 screens and CineMAX and INOX are both multiplex chains. These theatres practice safety guidelines in each cinema halls. Indonesia has the 21 Cineplex and Cinemaxx (as of 2019, renamed as Cinépolis) chain. A major Israel theater is Cinema City International. Japanese chains include Toho and Shochiku.

<doc id="77822" wikidata="Q187519" url="?curid=77822" title="Charles the Simple">
<text>Charles III (17 September 879 – 7 October 929), called the Simple or the Straightforward (from the Latin &quot;Carolus Simplex&quot;), was the king of West Francia from 898 until 922 and the king of Lotharingia from 911 until 919–923. He was a member of the Carolingian dynasty.

== Early life ==
Charles was the third and posthumous son of King Louis the Stammerer by his second wife Adelaide of Paris. As a child, Charles was prevented from succeeding to the throne at the time of the death in 884 of his half-brother, king Carloman II. Instead, Frankish nobles of the realm asked his cousin, Emperor Charles the Fat, to assume the crown. He was also prevented from succeeding the unpopular Charles the Fat, who was deposed in November 887 and died in January 888, although it is unknown if his overthrow was accepted or even made known in West Francia before his death. The nobility then elected Odo, the hero of the Siege of Paris (885–886) as the new king, although there was a faction that supported claims of Guy III of Spoleto. The young Charles was put under the protection of Ranulf II, the Duke of Aquitaine, who may have tried to claim the throne for him and in the end used the royal title himself until making peace with Odo.

== King of West Francia ==
In 893, at the age of 14, Charles was crowned by a faction opposed to the rule of Odo at the Reims Cathedral, becoming monarch of West Francia only after the death of Odo in 898.

In 911, a group of Vikings led by Rollo besieged Paris and Chartres. After a victory near Chartres on 26 August, Charles decided to negotiate with Rollo, resulting in the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte which created the Duchy of Normandy. In return for the Vikings&#x27; loyalty, they were granted all the land between the river Epte and the sea, as well as Duchy of Brittany, which at the time was an independent country which West Francia had unsuccessfully tried to conquer. Rollo also agreed to be baptised and to marry Charles&#x27;s daughter Gisela.

== King of Lotharingia ==
Also in 911, Louis the Child, the last Carolingian king of East Francia died, and nobles of Lotharingia, who had been loyal to him, under the leadership of Reginar, Duke of Lorraine declared Charles their new king, breaking from East Francia which had elected non-Carolingian Conrad I as the new king. Charles had tried to win Lotharingian support for years, for instance, by marrying in April 907 a Lotharingian woman named Frederuna, and in 909 his niece Cunigunda married Wigeric of Lotharingia. Charles defended Lotharingia against two attacks by Conrad I. In 925, Lotharingia was once again seized by East Francia.

== Revolt of the nobles ==

Queen Frederuna died on 10 February 917 leaving six daughters and no sons—and thus uncertainty as to the succession. On 7 October 919 Charles married Eadgifu, the daughter of Edward the Elder, King of England, who bore him a son, the future King Louis IV of France.

By this time, Charles&#x27;s excessive favouritism towards a certain Hagano, a petty nobleman (mediocris) and a relative of Charles&#x27;s first wife Frederuna, had turned the aristocracy against him. He endowed Hagano with monasteries that were already the benefices of other barons, alienating them. In Lotharingia, he earned the enmity of the new duke Gilbert, who in 919 declared loyalty to the new king of East Francia Henry the Fowler. Opposition to Charles in Lotharingia was not universal, however; he retained the support of Wigeric.

The nobles, completely exasperated with Charles&#x27;s policies and especially his favouritism of Count Hagano, seized Charles in 920. After negotiations by Archbishop Herveus of Reims the king was released.

In 922, the Frankish nobles revolted again led by Robert of Neustria. Robert, who was Odo&#x27;s brother, was elected king by the rebels and crowned, while Charles had to flee to Lotharingia. On 2 July 922, Charles lost his most faithful supporter, Herveus of Reims, who had succeeded Fulk in 900. Charles returned with a Norman army in 923 but was defeated on 15 June at the Battle of Soissons by Robert, who died in the battle. Charles was captured and imprisoned in a castle at Péronne under the guard of Herbert II of Vermandois. Robert&#x27;s son-in-law Rudolph of Burgundy was then elected to succeed him as king.

Charles died in prison on 7 October 929 and was buried at the nearby abbey of Saint-Fursy. His son by Eadgifu would eventually be crowned in 936 as Louis IV of France. In the initial aftermath of Charles&#x27;s defeat, Queen Eadgifu and their children fled to England.

=== Background ===
On 6 December 884, King Carloman II of West Francia died without a male heir and his half-brother, the future Charles the Simple, was just a five-year-old boy. Because of this, their cousin Charles the Fat, already Holy Roman Emperor and King of East Francia, was invited by the nobles of the Kingdom to assume the throne. Since the beginning, the new monarch was forced to deal with constant Viking raids, with little success. After three years of incompetent government, Charles the Fat was finally deposed by the Diet of Tribur in 887.

Faced with the growing threat of northern invaders, the local nobles again rejected the succession of Charles the Simple because he was too young, and Odo, Count of Paris (member of the Robertian dynasty) was chosen as the new King of West Francia, after successfully defending Paris against the Vikings, led by Rollo. In 893, aided by Archbishop Fulk of Reims, Charles the Simple attempted to reclaim the throne, but in vain. By 897, the young prince ruled only the city of Laon before Odo on his deathbed designated him as his successor.

Following the death of Odo in January 898, Charles the Simple finally assumed the title of king of West Francia. Soon the new monarch showed his ambition to conquer Lotharingia, the main objective of all the monarchs of West Francia since Charles the Bald. Lotharingia was the cradle of the Carolingian dynasty. Charlemagne&#x27;s ancestors, the Pippinids were from Lotharingia (Herstal, Jupille...). After the Treaty of Verdun in 843, the Lotharingia was part of Middle Francia for a short time and both West and East Francia tried to gain control over it. Arnulf of Carinthia, King of East Francia prevented this by entrusting the land to his son Zwentibold in 895. Zwentibold was hated by his subjects, so Charles the Simple decided to invade in 898 after being called by Count Reginar of Hainaut. After seizing Aachen and capturing Charlemagne&#x27;s Palace at Nijmegen, he returned to France at the request of the German bishops. A few years later, in September 911, the Lotharingian aristocracy again called on Charles the Simple after the death of Louis the Child, the last Carolingian ruler in East Francia.

Charles the Simple was crowned King of Lotharingia in early November 911. However, the constant absences of the new monarch (who preferred to stay in Aachen or Thionville), quickly irritated the Lotharingian nobility (who feared for their own independence) and nobles of France, who saw this inclination as an affront. The situation was even more complicated because, according to Flodoard, Charles the Simple refused to march against the Hungarians who threatened Lotharingia (only Archbishop Hervé de Reims was present there) and finally caused an open rebellion when he attempted to dispossess his own aunt, Abbess Rothilde (also mother-in-law of Hugh the Great), from Chelles Abbey in order to give it to his favourite, Hagano (a relative of his first wife Frederuna).

=== Deposition ===
From 920 to 922, Charles the Simple was in trouble. Although he signed the Treaty of Bonn with king Henry the Fowler of East Francia on 7 November 921, he had to fight on two fronts: one against Duke Giselbert of Lotharingia and the other against Hugh the Great, irritated by the treatment of his mother-in-law. Defeated, in June 922 Charles the Simple took refuge in Lotharingia. The nobles of West Francia declared him deposed from the throne, choosing as the new King Robert, Count of Paris, brother of the late King Odo and father of Hugh the Great.

Charles the Simple returned to France to regain the throne. His army, supported by a Lotharingian army and a group of soldiers, faced King Robert&#x27;s army at Soissons in June 923. According to Richerus, Robert was killed in battle by Count Fulbert or according to other historians, by Charles the Simple. Despite the death of Robert, his army won the battle and Charles the Simple had to escape from the battlefield. The French nobles elected Rudolph of France (Robert&#x27;s son-in-law) as their new King, with his coronation taking place on 13 July 923 at St Médard, Soissons.

During the summer, Charles the Simple was captured by Herbert II, Count of Vermandois, (another son-in-law of King Robert) at Château-Thierry; meanwhile, King Henry I of Germany took advantage of the situation to seize and add Lotharingia to his domains, after giving his daughter Gerberga of Saxony in marriage to Duke Giselbert.

After some time at Château-Thierry, the humiliated Charles the Simple was transferred in 924 to Péronne, where he died on 7 October 929 and was immediately buried in the local Monastery of Saint-Fursy. The legitimate Carolingian heir was now Louis, but King Rudolph retained the throne and ruled until his death from illness on 15 January 936 at Auxerre, being buried in the Abbey of Sainte-Colombe of Sens. The nobility then discussed who could be the next king, because Rudolph left no sons. Finally, the nobles unanimously summoned back Louis to France, thanks to the decisive support of Hugh the Great, to become their new king.

== Family ==
Charles first married in May 907 to Frederuna, daughter of Dietrich Theodorich von Ringelheim. Together they had six daughters:
* Frederuna
* Adelaide
* Gisela, wife of Rollo
* Rotrude

Charles married for the second time in 919 to Eadgifu of Wessex. Together they had one son:
* Louis IV of France (10 September 920 – 10 September 954), who eventually succeeded to the throne of West Francia in 936

Charles also had several other offspring:
* Arnulf
* Drogo
* († 976), Bishop of Laon
* Alpais, who married Erlebold, count of Lommegau.

<text>TNT (originally an abbreviation for Turner Network Television) is an American basic cable television channel owned by the Warner Bros. Discovery Networks unit of Warner Bros. Discovery. It was launched on October 3, 1988. TNT&#x27;s original purpose was to air classic films and television series to which Turner Broadcasting System maintained spillover rights through sister channel TBS. On June 2001, the network went through a major shift in its programming, and began to focus on dramatic television series and feature films, along with some sporting events (including NBA, NHL, U.S. Soccer, the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament and professional wrestling shows &quot;AEW Rampage and AEW Collision&quot;), as TBS shifted its focus to comedic programming. , TNT was received by approximately 89.573 million households that subscribe to a subscription television service throughout the United States. By June 2023, this number has dropped to 71.2 million households. Its sister networks are TBS, TruTV, and Turner Classic Movies, with the former two also having sports coverage. Due to its programming focusing mainly on dramas, the channel is called TNT Drama by some, with its website URL alluding to this.

==History==

===Beginnings===

Prior to the launch of the channel in 1988, the Turner Network Television name had been used by the Turner Broadcasting System for an ad hoc syndication service which produced and distributed various sporting events for carriage on Turner&#x27;s Atlanta, Georgia, superstation WTBS (channel 17, now WPCH-TV, which was separated from its national cable feed, TBS, in October 2007) as well as broadcast television stations throughout the United States.

The Turner Network Television syndication service launched in 1982 to produce two exhibition games organized by the NFL Players Association (NFLPA) during the NFL strike, which were broadcast on WTBS and its national superstation feed. (The agreement with the NFLPA originally called for 18 games to be broadcast by WTBS on Sunday afternoons and Monday nights during the originally proposed strike season, but was reduced to the exhibition games amid lawsuits filed by the National Football League against Turner Broadcasting and the NFLPA union.) The TNT syndication service also produced and distributed the first Goodwill Games—organized by Ted Turner himself, in response to the Olympic boycotts involving the United States and the Soviet Union of the 1980 and 1984 Summer Olympics—in 1986.

On October 6, 1987, Ted Turner announced the launch of Turner Network Television (TNT)—his fifth basic cable network venture, following SuperStation TBS, CNN, Headline News (now HLN) and the short-lived Cable Music Channel—in a keynote address at the opening day of the Atlantic Cable Show in Atlantic City, New Jersey, stating that the channel would center around major television events. Turner originally estimated that TNT would be offered to cable systems at a monthly rate of 10¢ per subscriber at launch (increasing to 20¢ per subscriber per month by March 1989), with 10 minutes of advertising being carried each hour (three to four minutes of which would be given to prospective cable systems for local advertising). Turner Broadcasting struggled to obtain carriage commitments from various cable providers to commence with the proposed service&#x27;s launch plans, making TNT&#x27;s fate uncertain. Turner also entered into preliminary discussions with NBC to purchase a 25% stake in the company, with the prospect of using NBC&#x27;s financial and programming expertise to get TNT off the ground; however, such discussions terminated by January 1988 without a resolution.
By February 1988, Turner had disclosed that TNT&#x27;s programming would focus around movies from the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) film library – which Turner acquired as a result of his 1986 sale of the MGM film studio to Kirk Kerkorian – and major television events, including made-for-cable movies, high-profile specials, sports events, documentaries and miniseries. Cable systems were given the option of substituting a superstation (other than SuperStation TBS) or other out-of-market television station for TNT upon launch without incurring any copyright liabilities for carriage of the distant signal for the second half of 1988. However, the proposed launch date, originally slated for July 1 of that year, was delayed because it would have presented several issues, including obtaining channel clearances and assembling a programming schedule in such a contracted timespan, and the unfavorability of promoting a service during the summer (when television networks typically programmed reruns). On March 7, Turner Broadcasting System&#x27;s board of directors unanimously approved Ted Turner&#x27;s plan for Turner Network Television, with October 3 as the channel&#x27;s proposed launch date. Plans called for TNT to offer 250 nights of original and live sports programming per year within five years of its debut.

The channel launched at 7:55 p.m. Eastern Time on October 3, 1988, with TNT founder Ted Turner delivering a message about the channel&#x27;s launch and programming, followed by a pre-recorded performance of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner,&quot; which traditionally played during the launch of a new Turner-owned network. Its inaugural telecast (which followed at 8:00 p.m. Eastern) was the first half of the 1939 classic film &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, a film to which Ted Turner had acquired the rights; the second half aired the following night at the same time (both halves were repeated at 11:00 p.m. Eastern on their respective nights), with the film then being shown in its entirety that Sunday. It was said that &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; was chosen as the channel&#x27;s inaugural program because it was Turner&#x27;s favorite movie. (&quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; would also serve as the first program aired on sister channel Turner Classic Movies, when it debuted in April 1994.) Incidentally, the film was set and had its premiere held in Atlanta, Turner&#x27;s hometown and the headquarters of the channel&#x27;s corporate parent, Turner Broadcasting System.

TNT was initially a vehicle for older movies and television shows to which Turner either already held rights or acquired specifically for the channel; these films made up the majority of TNT&#x27;s programming during its first six years of operation. The initial schedule also consisted of animated and live-action children&#x27;s programs (airing Sunday through Fridays from 7:00 to 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time and Monday through Saturdays from 6:00 to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time), with western series on Saturday mornings and a limited schedule of other classic television series in select other time periods. In its early years, TNT caused controversy among film critics and fans for its airings of colorized versions of many classics that were originally filmed in black-and-white.

The channel launched with an estimated 17 million subscribers, its initial coverage totaling 6.8 times that of the largest previous cable network launch (VH1, which launched on January 1, 1985, with 2.5 million homes estimated to have initially received that channel). The channel&#x27;s operations were based inside office space at Turner Broadcasting&#x27;s Techwood Drive complex in midtown Atlanta that formerly served as the facilities for CNN Headline News from its launch as CNN2 in January 1982 until it and parent network CNN moved their operations into the CNN Center downtown in 1987. Turner Entertainment Networks president Gerald Hogan stated around the time of its launch that TNT would eventually become &quot;the first cable network to directly challenge the three broadcast networks,&quot; through the production of original programming that would be of &quot;a quality level equal to and [..] significantly better&quot; than programs carried on the major American broadcast television networks; as such, the channel slowly began to add original programming and newer reruns within two years of its launch. The channel debuted its first original made-for-TV film on March 8, 1989, when TNT premiered &quot;Nightbreaker&quot;, an Arms Race-era drama starring Martin Sheen (who also co-produced the film) and Emilio Estevez.

===Expansion===

In September 1995, TNT debuted &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot;, which assumed the distinction as the flagship program of the now-defunct World Championship Wrestling (WCW) from &quot;WCW Saturday Night&quot;, ran on TBS until 2000. At one point, &quot;Monday Nitro&quot; was regularly the highest-rated weekly program on cable television. &quot;Monday Nitro&quot; beat &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, the flagship show of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF; now the WWE or World Wrestling Entertainment), in the ratings for 83 consecutive weeks from 1996 to 1998. However, by early 1999, &quot;Monday Nitro&quot; began to lose viewers to &quot;Raw&quot;, which became the highest-rated wrestling program on television due to its use of more adult-like storylines. On March 23, 2001, the WWF acquired most of the assets of WCW, which had been up for sale since late 2000; &quot;Monday Nitro&quot; aired its last episode three days later.

On September 22, 1995, Time Warner Entertainment—a New York City-based media company formed in 1989 through the merger of Time Inc. and Warner Bros. corporate parent Warner Communications—reached an agreement to acquire the Turner Broadcasting System and its associated properties (including TNT, TBS, CNN, Headline News and Cartoon Network as well as Turner Entertainment) for $7.5 billion; the deal would also expand Time Warner Entertainment&#x27;s pay television holdings, as it had owned HBO and sister premium service Cinemax as well as cable television provider Time Warner Cable since the Time-Warner Communications merger six years prior. (Time Warner and predecessor Warner Communications had owned an 18% interest in Turner Broadcasting since 1987, as part of a cable television industry-backed bailout of the company amid severe financial issues.) Under the terms, Turner would acquire an approximate 10% interest in Time Warner Entertainment as well as oversee its subscription network group—comprising the Turner and Home Box Office units and its minority interests in Comedy Central and E!—and hold a position on the company&#x27;s board of directors (which he retained until he stepped down from the company in February 2006) upon the merger&#x27;s closure. The merger received regulatory approval on September 12, 1996; the Turner–Time Warner deal was finalized one month later on October 10, forming what at the time was the largest media company in the world.

The channel was also known for its late night programming. One such program was &quot;MonsterVision&quot;, a Saturday night B movie showcase that aired from 1991 to 2000. Often the series had special themes, such as &quot;Godzilla Bash &#x27;94,&quot; an all-day marathon of movies from the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise. Penn &amp; Teller served as occasional guest hosts during its early years; and in 1996, &quot;MonsterVision&quot; found a permanent host in cult personality and drive-in movie aficionado Joe Bob Briggs, who hosted a pair of more contemporary horror films each week, such as &quot;Friday the 13th Part 2&quot; and &quot;Wes Craven&#x27;s New Nightmare&quot;. During the wraparound segments within each film, Briggs provided a running commentary, trivia, off-color jokes, and a drive-in total, as well as jokes at the expense of TNT&#x27;s Standards &amp; Practices department regarding the heavy censorship of the featured movies. This running joke culminated in a &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; all-night Halloween marathon in 1998, where it was implied that Ted Turner was out to kill him.

Into the 1990s, TNT continued to air cartoons from the Turner library, such as &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;, and &quot;The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest&quot; as part of a daily block called &quot;TNT Toons&quot;; the DePatie-Freleng &quot;Pink Panther&quot; cartoons were also featured. &quot;The Rudy and Gogo World Famous Cartoon Show&quot;, which ran from 1995 to 1997, was an original children&#x27;s program on the channel featuring Warner Bros., MGM, and &quot;Popeye&quot; shorts, hosted by a titular pair of a marionette and a nanny goat. In January 1996, the channel began scaling back its children&#x27;s programming amid competition in that market from Nickelodeon and Turner-owned sister channel Cartoon Network; at that time, TNT discontinued its late-afternoon block of animated series in favor of airing acquired drama series such as &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; and &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;. In 1998, TNT dropped all of its remaining cartoons, relegating those shows to Cartoon Network. Most of the animated series and shorts that were dropped would also serve as the core of Boomerang, a subscription channel devoted to classic cartoons that launched on April 1, 2000.

During the 1990s, TNT scheduled a weekday afternoon block that included &quot;Due South&quot;, &quot;Kung Fu: The Legend Continues&quot;, &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; and &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. In 1998, TNT made efforts to increase its original programming, bumping its production budget by 146%, with programming production costs running in the range of $175 million to $200 million by 2000. That year, TNT took over production of the fifth and final season of &quot;Babylon 5&quot; from the Prime Time Entertainment Network after the ad hoc syndication block ceased operations. The following year, TNT produced the &quot;Babylon 5&quot; spinoff series &quot;Crusade&quot;, which was canceled after 13 episodes, as TNT management decided that science fiction did not fit the channel&#x27;s brand identity. In 2001, TNT debuted what became its most successful original series at the time, &quot;Witchblade&quot;, which ran for two seasons, ending in 2002.

===Shift towards drama===

On June 12, 2001, TNT underwent an extensive rebrand, with the introduction of a new logo designed by Trollbäck + Company as well as a new slogan, &quot;We Know Drama,&quot; a repositioning of TNT that Bradley Siegel, then-president of Turner Entertainment Networks, explained had emerged through extensive focus group research with frequent TNT viewers. The slogan emphasized the channel&#x27;s new focus on dramatic programming, including sports and off-network syndicated dramas such as &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;, &quot;ER&quot; and &quot;Judging Amy&quot;.

On January 1, 2003, TNT launched a substitute feed called &quot;TNT Plus&quot;, although it does not appear this was ever reflected in the channel&#x27;s on-air identity. The apparent sole purpose of its establishment was to force renegotiations with subscription providers to increase carriage fees—with some multiple system operators suggesting that Turner was seeking a 10% increase in subscriber fees for the channel—to help pay for TNT&#x27;s new NBA and NASCAR contracts well before the channel&#x27;s distribution agreements with providers were scheduled to come up for renewal. In theory, TNT Plus was to have been the sole carrier of Turner&#x27;s NBA and NASCAR coverage from that point forward, while any providers still carrying the original TNT would have seen replacement programming instead. Although it appears that Comcast did not immediately sign on to carry TNT Plus, there is no evidence that Turner had actually pulled its sports programming from the &quot;original&quot; TNT.

On December 7, 2008, TNT unveiled an update to its logo, displaying it mainly in a silver or sometimes gold beveling. The &quot;We know drama&quot; tagline remained, but the channel added more of a focus on its original series and announced plans to carry three nights of original programming a week during primetime, starting in 2009. In 2012, TNT rebranded itself with a new slogan: &quot;Drama, Period.&quot; (visually displayed as &quot;Drama.,&quot; with the TNT logo serving as the period symbol), with the logo being recolored to match the themes of its shows.

On May 14, 2014, TNT altered its on-air branding to &quot;TNT Drama&quot; and introduced a new slogan, &quot;Boom.&quot; The branding campaign reflects the channel&#x27;s refocusing towards action-adventure, sci-fi, fantasy, mystery, suspense series alongside its slate of crime dramas. TNT purchased subscription-television rights in September for the next five Marvel Studios films starting with &quot;&quot;. In 2016, TNT changed its logo after 15 years.

===AT&amp;T ownership===
On October 22, 2016, AT&amp;T announced an offer to acquire Time Warner for $108.7 billion, including debt it would assume from the latter; the merger would bring Time Warner&#x27;s various media properties, including TBS, under the same corporate umbrella as AT&amp;T&#x27;s telecommunications holdings, including satellite provider DirecTV. Time Warner shareholders approved the merger on February 15, 2017; however, on February 28, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced that his agency will not review the deal, leaving the review to the U.S. Department of Justice. On November 20, 2017, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit against AT&amp;T and Time Warner in an attempt to block the merger, citing antitrust concerns surrounding the transaction. The proposed merger—which had already been approved by the European Commission and Mexican, Chilean and Brazilian regulatory authorities—was affirmed by court ruling on June 12, 2018, after District of Columbia U.S. District Court Judge Richard J. Leon ruled in favor of AT&amp;T, dismissing the DOJ&#x27;s antitrust claims in the lawsuit. The merger closed two days later on June 14, with the company becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of AT&amp;T under the renamed parent company WarnerMedia. The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington unanimously upheld the lower court&#x27;s ruling in favor of AT&amp;T on February 26, 2019.

On March 4, 2019, WarnerMedia underwent a major reorganization of its broadcasting assets, in which Turner Broadcasting would effectively be dissolved, and WarnerMedia&#x27;s television properties would be divided among three divisions within the WarnerMedia umbrella, with TNT, along with TBS, truTV and HBO being reassigned to WarnerMedia Entertainment, chaired by Bob Greenblatt. AT&amp;T did not specify any timetable for the changes to take effect, although WarnerMedia had begun to remove all Turner references in corporate communications and press releases, referring to that unit&#x27;s networks as &quot;divisions of WarnerMedia.&quot;
On May 15, 2019, upstart promotion All Elite Wrestling (AEW) and WarnerMedia announced a broadcasting agreement to offer a weekly prime-time wrestling program on TNT—later named &quot;AEW Dynamite&quot;, which premiered on October 2, 2019, as AEW&#x27;s flagship program—marking TNT&#x27;s re-entry into the professional wrestling scene following the aforementioned closure of WCW eighteen years prior. On August 13, 2021, AEW premiered a second weekly program on TNT—&quot;Rampage&quot;—which airs on Friday nights. In January 2022, &quot;Dynamite&quot; moved to TBS, with &quot;Rampage&quot; remaining on TNT. AEW would add a third weekly program, that being &quot;Collision&quot;, on June 17, 2023; &quot;Collision&quot; airs mostly on Saturday nights on TNT.

===Warner Bros. Discovery ownership===
On April 8, 2022, WarnerMedia was divested by AT&amp;T and merged with Discovery Inc. to form Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD). On April 26, it was reported that WBD had suspended original scripted series development at TBS and TNT in order to evaluate the channels&#x27; strategies moving forward. At this point, TNT only had two original scripted series still airing first-run episodes, &quot;Animal Kingdom&quot; and &quot;Snowpiercer&quot;, both of which are preparing for their final seasons. On May 11, Brett Weitz was removed as general manager for TBS, TNT, and TruTV; the channels are now overseen by Kathleen Finch as head of U.S. Networks.

==High-definition feed==

TNT HD is a high definition simulcast feed of TNT, which broadcasts at a picture resolution of 1080i; the HD feed launched on May 21, 2004, inaugurated with the network&#x27;s coverage of Game 1 of the 2004 NBA Western Conference finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Minnesota Timberwolves. TNT has been criticized for its practice of airing a significant amount of 4:3 standard-definition content stretched to 16:9 on its HD feed, using a nonlinear process similar to the &quot;panorama&quot; setting on many HDTVs that some viewers have nicknamed Stretch-o-Vision.

Though other cable channels have also fallen into this practice for their HD simulcast feeds, TNT has been the one most commonly cited since it was one of the first channels to offer such a simulcast. The nonlinear stretching process leaves objects in the center of the screen with approximately their original aspect ratio; objects at the left and right edges are distorted. All HD programs are broadcast in 5.1 surround sound.

==Programming==

Ever since 2001, TNT currently airs a mix of original drama and reality series, and reruns of dramas that originally aired on the major broadcast networks. Original programs currently seen on TNT as of 2022 include &quot;Animal Kingdom&quot; and &quot;Snowpiercer&quot;. The channel&#x27;s daytime, overnight and Saturday morning schedule is heavily dominated by reruns of current and former network police procedural series such as &quot;Castle,&quot; &quot;Bones&quot; and TNT mainstay &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, while its weekday morning schedule focuses on sci-fi, supernatural and fantasy series.

===Movies===
Feature films have been a mainstay of TNT since its inception. TNT maintains film licensing agreements with sister company Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. (primarily releases from Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema), The Walt Disney Studios (primarily releases from Walt Disney Pictures (live-action only), Touchstone Pictures, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm and 20th Century Studios), Columbia Pictures, Universal Pictures and Paramount Pictures.

Since the launch of Turner Classic Movies, TNT&#x27;s film lineup has shifted away from classic films outside of special airings of films such as &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (which has been aired recently since 2014) in December many times in a row on certain days every year either before or close to Christmas time. &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; had also used to be aired on TNT in the past for several years in November close to Thanksgiving time a few times in a row on certain days every year too. Now in favor of more recent films released from the 1980s onward, with an emphasis on films released after 1995. Presently, most of the films broadcast on TNT are of the drama and action genres, however some comedy films continue to air on the channel periodically. Films generally air on the channel during the overnight hours on most nights and for much of the day on weekends.

Beginning in 1997, TNT broadcast a 24-hour marathon of the 1983 comedy film &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; from the evening of Christmas Eve to the evening of Christmas Day. The marathon also runs on its sister channel TBS beginning in 2004, when the annual event became exclusive to that channel and it still does now along with TNT airing it again at the same time starting in 2014 together on both networks. Beginning one hour early on TBS, one hour later on TNT and ending one hour early on TBS and one hour later on TNT. Each weekend, TNT airs a film in primetime with limited commercial interruption, branded in on-air promos under the title &quot;More Movies, Less Commercials.&quot;

===Sports programming===
====National Basketball Association====
In July 1989, the Turner Broadcasting System announced that TNT would obtain partial pay television rights to the National Basketball Association (NBA) beginning with the , as part of a transference of TBS SuperStation&#x27;s existing NBA telecast rights. As a result, TNT&#x27;s NBA coverage would consist of games involving other teams within the league, with TBS&#x27;s rights being scaled back to only encompass game telecasts involving the franchise serving its parent television station WTBS&#x27;s home market, the Atlanta Hawks (which Ted Turner had purchased from Atlanta-based real estate developer Tom Cousins in 1977). Under the initial agreement and a subsequent five-year contract signed in December 1989, TNT carried about 50 regular season and 25 playoff games during the inaugural season of its contractual rights. (TBS SuperStation/WTBS, in acquiring exclusivity for the Hawks, expanded its schedule to include 25 away games through the acquisition of Atlanta rival WGNX [now CBS affiliate WANF]&#x27;s partial Hawks telecast rights.)

In the early 1990s, some Hawks game telecasts shown on TNT and TBS were blacked out within 35 miles of the home team&#x27;s arena. This restriction was dropped in 2000, allowing TNT the right to be the exclusive broadcaster of any game it chose to carry. TNT had regularly broadcast NBA games on multiple Tuesday nights until the and again since 2021. The weekly telecasts were then moved to Thursday nights in until 2021 in which it moved back to Tuesday nights, when TBS was opted out of rights to NBA coverage as a result of the league&#x27;s contract renewal with Turner Sports. In addition to carrying NBA regular season games, which typically air as a doubleheader on most weeks, TNT also airs opening night games, the NBA All-Star Game, and the vast majority of games within the conference playoffs and one of the Conference finals (the Eastern Conference finals in odd-number years and the Western Conference finals in even-numbered years). Since 2015, the All-Star Game has been simulcast on TBS to prevent it from counterprogramming TNT, although in 2022 TBS experimented with an alternate broadcast of the game featuring the panel of TNT&#x27;s studio show &quot;Inside the NBA&quot;.

====National Hockey League====
Beginning in the 2021–22 NHL season, Turner Sports holds rights to the National Hockey League (NHL); the contract includes rights to up to 72 exclusive regular season games per-season on TNT, predominantly consisting of Wednesday night doubleheaders. TNT also splits coverage of the Stanley Cup Playoffs with fellow rightsholder ESPN, and will hold exclusive rights to the Stanley Cup Finals in odd-numbered years.

====College basketball====
In 2011, TNT obtained a share in the television rights to the NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Championship as part of a comprehensive broadcast rights deal known as &quot;NCAA March Madness&quot;. The deal also involves CBS and fellow Turner properties TBS and TruTV. During even-numbered years, Turner holds exclusive rights to the Final Four-onward; until 2022, TNT and TruTV aired alternate broadcasts of the games tailored towards the participating teams, but this was quietly discontinued in 2022, with all three channels simulcasting the TBS broadcast.

====Golf====

TNT televised the PGA Championship, carrying full coverage of the first two rounds and early coverage of the weekend rounds. The rights were held from 1999 to 2019, when the contract with the PGA of America ended—after which ESPN assumed the rights. TNT&#x27;s golf coverage has since been limited to &quot;The Match&quot;—a series of charity match play events organized by Turner Sports that are simulcast across the Turner channels.

In 2003, TNT took over the rights to broadcast the Thursday and Friday rounds of The Open Championship, as well as the rights to weekday rounds of the Women&#x27;s British Open and Senior British Open. ESPN assumed the Open Championship rights in 2009. From 2000 to 2007, TNT also carried the biennial PGA Tour-managed Presidents Cup. The television rights were assumed by Golf Channel beginning with the 2009 event until the 2019 event as part of its overall cable television deal with the PGA Tour, from the 2020 event and on those rights were transferred back to ESPN.

==== UEFA Champions League ====
Beginning in the 2018–19 season, Turner Sports held the rights to the UEFA Champions League and Europa League, the two highest levels of European club competition, under a three-year deal. 46 Champions League matches and the finals of both competitions (as well as the UEFA Super Cup) are aired per-season on TNT, with the remainder streaming on B/R Live—a newly created streaming service run by its sister sports news website &quot;Bleacher Report&quot;. In June 2020, Turner Sports announced they would be ending their deal to broadcast the UEFA Champions League a year early with those rights headed to future rights partner CBS Sports.

==== Major League Baseball (overflow) ====

TNT carries limited playoff coverage from MLB on TBS, but only in rare exceptions where a long-running or extra innings game forces a bump over in coverage of the newer game temporarily from TBS to TNT until the earlier game&#x27;s conclusion, when the coverage on TNT ends at the conclusion of the current half-inning and the game moves fully to TBS (due to this, TNT&#x27;s schedule in early-to-mid October is usually made up of little original content). In the 2011 and 2012 playoffs, it carried seven pre-scheduled Division Series games in full before Major League Baseball decided to use MLB Network in future years in a shift of scheduling to allow more night game carriage.

====NASCAR====
In 2001, TNT began presenting NASCAR coverage, as part of NASCAR&#x27;s first unified television rights deal (where television rights were centralized with the association itself, rather than brokered directly by each track owner). The broadcasts were a successor to TBS&#x27;s past NASCAR broadcasts and originally intended to be carried by TBS, but ultimately assigned to TNT in support of its new brand positioning. TNT&#x27;s coverage was initially a co-production with NBC Sports, serving as the cable partner for NBC&#x27;s broadcast television coverage of NASCAR. Under the contract, TNT held the cable rights for the second half of the Winston Cup Series and Busch Series seasons, carrying races not aired by NBC; the broadcasts shared their on-air production and talent with NBC&#x27;s broadcasts.

When the contract expired in 2006, NBC declined to bid on the next package. TNT would join Fox and new rightsholder ESPN as part of the next round of broadcast rights, retaining a smaller package of six mid-season Nextel Cup Series races per-season, beginning with Daytona&#x27;s July race (by then known as the Coke Zero 400)—which became exclusive to TNT under the new contract; previously, NBC and TNT held rights to the race in odd-numbered years, alternating with Fox (which carried the race in even numbered years; contrarily, the network not carrying the 400 would carry the Daytona 500). The contract lasted through the 2014 season, after which NASCAR returned to splitting its media rights between Fox and NBC. NASCAR will return to TNT in 2025 for five mid-season NASCAR Cup Series races, with NASCAR holding an in-season tournament during these 5 races not too dissimilar to the NBA Cup.

====National Football League====

In 1990, TNT obtained partial television rights to the NFL&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; package in a comprehensive agreement in which games were split with ESPN. The &quot;NFL on TNT&quot; consisted of three or four preseason game broadcasts and telecasts of regular season games during the first half of each season until 1997. Abiding by NFL broadcasting rules, TNT distributed its game telecasts to broadcast television stations in the local markets of the teams playing in that week&#x27;s game.

==International==
European, Middle Eastern, African, Australian, Latin American and Asian versions of TNT were launched in the middle of 1990s, which were exclusively dedicated to movies, mainly from the MGM and Warner Bros. archives (however, the UK, Scandinavian, and Australian versions of TNT all broadcast &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot; (the UK and Scandinavian versions broadcast the show on Friday nights on a four-day delay from its U.S. broadcast), and the Latin American version aired a children&#x27;s block called &quot;Magic Box&quot;). The European, Australian and Asian versions of TNT shared channel space with Cartoon Network, while the Latin American version shared space with CNN International. The Europe, Middle East and Africa, Asia-Pacific TNT channels were eventually relaunched as Turner Classic Movies, while the Latin American version retained the TNT branding. The most well-known TNT channel in Canada, Latin America, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Asia-Pacific was (and still is) the French version, which used similar graphics to what the flagship U.S. channel was using at the time.

===Canada===

No version or feed for TNT exists in Canada though some of its programming is aired on Bell Media channels such as CTV Drama Channel and TSN.

===Latin America===
Regional versions of TNT were launched in Latin America in 1991; the channel mostly shows films, along with a few series. All programs used to be presented subbed in Spanish and Portuguese, until 2015, when the channel reverted it and made available the dubs; however, the channel also offers closed captions (which can be removed or placed by the user) on digital operators. TNT Latin America and TNT Brazil began operating high definition simulcast feeds in 2009. In Latin America, TNT broadcasts all of the high-profile award shows including the Academy Awards, the Emmy Awards, and the Grammy Awards.

===Germany===

In January 2009, a version of TNT launched in Germany as TNT Serie. The channel shows a wide variety of older and recent American drama and comedy programs (such as &quot;30 Rock&quot;, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;Monk&quot;, &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;, &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, &quot;ER&quot;, &quot;The King of Queens&quot;, &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;, &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot;, &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; and &quot;Falling Skies&quot;). TNT Serie maintains two audio channels: one with the original English language audio track and one with a German-dubbed soundtrack. In June 2009, the German version of TCM was relaunched as TNT Film. TNT also has a comedy channel which shows &quot;2 Broke Girls&quot;, &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; and &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;. TNT Comedy also maintains two audio channels: TNT Serie, TNT Comedy and TNT Film both launched high definition simulcast feeds in the fall of 2010. On June 14, 2021, it was announced that TNT would be rebranding their channels into Warner TV from September 25, 2021.

===Spain===
The TNT brand returned to the Spanish market in the summer of 2007, when it launched exclusively on the pay television platform Digital+. , TNT is available on several subscription providers in Spain. TNT España is divided into two blocks: one exclusively carrying movies and another exclusively carrying television series (such as &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot;, &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;, &quot;Falling Skies&quot; and &quot;Sherlock&quot;). In 2019, TNT España aired the first series they commissioned locally in Spain, &quot;Vota Juan&quot;. The channel was rebranded as Warner TV on April 14, 2023, discontinuing the TNT brand as an entertainment channel in Europe in the process.

===Turkey===
A local version of TNT in Turkey launched on March 3, 2008, by Doğan Media Group as a channel focusing on feature films. Foreign television series and movies were eventually added to the channel&#x27;s schedule. On January 24, 2011, it was relaunched as a general entertainment channel with the addition of new television series to its lineup. In 2012, TNT was rebranded as tv2.

===Scandinavia===

The Scandinavian TNT channel was originally launched by tabloid newspaper Aftonbladet as &quot;Aftonbladet TV7&quot; on October 9, 2006. Aftonbladet sold the channel in late 2007. In August 2008, it was sold once again to NonStop Television. On March 2, 2011, the channel was relaunched as TNT7, following the Turner Broadcasting System&#x27;s purchase of NonStop Television owner Millennium Media Group. On March 21, 2012, the channel was renamed TNT, dropping the &quot;7&quot; from the name.

===Netherlands and Flanders===

On April 10, 2012, TNT HD Benelux launched in Belgium, carried exclusively on Telenet. The first month of the service was offered to consumers for free, with a subscription required thereafter to view the channel. TNT HD Benelux offers a mix of comedies, movies and current television series (such as &quot;Falling Skies&quot;, &quot;Shameless&quot; and &quot;Memphis Beat&quot;), as well as reruns of older series (such as &quot;ER&quot;, &quot;The West Wing&quot; and &quot;Smallville&quot;). The channel launched in the Netherlands on January 24, 2013. It was later launched on SNOW and Belgacom TV in Belgium; however it stopped broadcasting in both countries on January 1, 2014.

===Poland===
The Polish version of TNT was launched as Turner Classic Movies (TCM) on June 1, 1998, replacing the European version of TNT, Classic Movies. It relaunched in both SD and HD on October 6, 2015. On July 8, 2021, it was announced that the channel would rebrand into Warner TV from October 23.

===Romania===
The European version of TNT was launched for first time in Romania on September 17, 1993, with Cartoon Network, until October 15, 1999, when it was replaced with Turner Classic Movies. In 2007, TCM was localized in Romania, the Romanian version was launched and it was made a 24/7 channel. On some carriers, Cartoon Network and TCM were shared (the last carrier who maintained them shared was RDS-RCS, from launch of European version to October 20, 2017). On October 6, 2015, TCM was replaced by TNT, 22 years after the first launch. On July 8, 2021, it was announced that the channel would rebrand into Warner TV from October 23.

===Africa===

The African version of TNT launched on October 15, 1995. On October 15, 1999, TNT was replaced with Turner Classic Movies. On September 21, 2018, 23 years after the first relaunch, TNT replaced the African version of TCM.

===Thailand===
Launched in 2016, it replaced Toonami Thailand. Owned by M Turner Company (a joint-venture with Major Kantana Co., Ltd.), the channel was closed on January 1, 2018.

===United Kingdom===
A service carrying Cartoon Network programming from 5am to 7pm and a TNT channel at other times launched on the analog Astra satellite service in September 1993; the start time of TNT broadcasts was later pushed back to 9pm to allow additional time for cartoons. The UK version of TNT was predominantly a movie channel, though some other content, most prominently WCW wrestling also aired. Cable networks provided TNT and a separate 24-hour Cartoon Network feed, and when digital services launched from the late 90s the 24-hour Cartoon Network transitioned across but TNT did not; instead, from October 1999 a 24-hour Turner Classic Movies service was launched to digital viewers, with the analog TNT service revised at the same time into a general entertainment service showing drama, films and sport. This continued until July 2000, when TNT UK was withdrawn and replaced on the soon-to-decline analog platforms by a cut-down version of TCM, running from 9pm to 1am nightly. This ended use of the TNT brand in the UK, though other Turner/Warner properties continued to operate in the territory.

The TNT brand returned to the UK after more than two decades on July 18, 2023, with the rebranding of the BT Sport channel network as TNT Sports, following the establishment of a joint-venture between BT Group and Warner Bros. Discovery to take charge of the channels previously wholly-owned by BT. The Eurosport channels&#x27; UK operations will be shut down and folded into TNT Sports at some point between 2024 and 2026, following the 2024 Summer Olympics.

<text>USA Network (or simply USA) is an American basic cable television channel owned by the NBCUniversal Media Group division of Comcast&#x27;s NBCUniversal. It was launched in 1977 as Madison Square Garden Sports Network, one of the first national sports cable television channels. 

It was relaunched under its current name on April 9, 1980, and in the years since then, USA steadily gained popularity through its original programming, a long-established partnership with WWF/WWE and, for many years, limited sports programming. USA increased its sports coverage significantly in 2022, after the shutdown of NBCSN, and now serves as the main cable component of NBC Sports. 

, USA Network is available to approximately 70,000,000 pay television households in the United States, down from its 2011 peak of 100,000,000 households.

==History==
===Madison Square Garden Sports Network (1977–1980)===
USA Network was launched on September 22, 1977, as the Madison Square Garden Sports Network (not to be confused with the New York City-area regional sports network now known as the MSG Network). The network was founded by cable provider UA-Columbia Cablevision and the Madison Square Garden Corp. From its first two decades, the network was run by chairwoman and CEO Kay Koplovitz. The channel was one of the first national cable television channels, utilizing satellite delivery as opposed to the then-industry standard microwave relay to distribute its programming to cable systems. Unlike other cable networks at the time, it also was the first to rely greatly on advertising revenue. At launch the network mostly broadcast sporting events from Madison Square Garden to a national audience (sharing programming with the aforementioned MSG Network). The network quickly added a mix of college and less well-known professional sports held at other venues, similar to those found during the early years of ESPN. In 1978, children&#x27;s programming was also added to the lineup.

=== MCA/Paramount ownership (1981–1994) and Time ownership (1981–1987) ===
On April 9, 1980, the channel changed its name to USA Network. It also added a children&#x27;s program called &quot;Calliope&quot; to its schedule and some talk shows in an effort to appeal to women. The new network also offered a programming block from Black Entertainment Television (which would eventually launch as its own network three years later, but now owned by Paramount as of 2001) and carried C-SPAN during the day.

In 1981, ownership of the network changed. First, Time Inc. agreed to buy UA-Columbia&#x27;s share of the network contingent upon Madison Square Garden owner Gulf + Western transferring its share of the network to its Paramount Pictures division. Shortly thereafter MCA Inc. also bought into the network with the three companies each owning an equal share. The three partners had a non-compete clause that would prevent them from owning other basic cable networks independently from the USA joint venture; however, it was acknowledged that Time also owned powerful USA Network rival Home Box Office. This clause would cause Time Inc. to drop out of the venture in 1987, as the company attempted (but failed) to buy CNN from Ted Turner and run it independently from USA. MCA and Paramount subsequently became the sole owners of the channel (being a 50/50 joint venture between the two companies).

C-SPAN stopped sharing satellite space with USA on April 1, 1982, after having launched its own 24-hour feed two months earlier. USA began operating on a 24-hour schedule, programming its new daytime block with the British soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, a health-oriented show named &quot;Alive and Well&quot;, and an afternoon movie.

In fall 1982, the channel began running a mix of 1960s and 1970s Hanna-Barbera cartoons each weekday evening from 6:00 to 7:00 p.m. as part of the new &quot;USA Cartoon Express&quot; block, with sports programming airing after 7:00 p.m., which were rebroadcast during the overnight hours. Weekends featured a mix of movies, some older drama series and talk shows during the morning hours, and sports during the afternoons and evenings. Overnights consisted of old low-budget films and film shorts, and music videos as part of a show called &quot;Night Flight.&quot;

Between 1984 and 1986, USA&#x27;s programming focus began shifting away from sports, and shifted towards general entertainment programs not found on broadcast stations, including some less common network drama series, situation comedies and cartoons.

For the 1985–1986 season, the channel had four hours of original and exclusive shows. One original series from the 1985–1986 season was the comedy &quot;Check It Out!&quot;. USA, wanting to become the flagship cable channel and compete directly with the broadcast networks, committed to 26 half-hours of part exclusive off-broadcast network and part original programming for the 1986–1987 season at an increase of $30 million. In one case, the channel picked up &quot;Airwolf&quot; for 58 off-network episodes, while commissioning 24 new episodes without the original cast.

One tradition on USA was an afternoon lineup of game show reruns mixed in with several original low-budget productions that aired over the years. It began in October 1984 with reruns of &quot;The Gong Show&quot; and &quot;Make Me Laugh.&quot; In September 1985, the network began airing its first original game show, a revival of the mid-1970s game show &quot;Jackpot;&quot; two more original game shows, &quot;Love Me, Love Me Not,&quot; and a revival of the 1980 series &quot;Chain Reaction,&quot; were added in September 1986. More shows were progressively added soon afterward such as &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild,&quot; &quot;Tic-Tac-Dough,&quot; &quot;Press Your Luck,&quot; &quot;High Rollers,&quot; and &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; (with John Davidson as its &quot;Square-Master&quot;, or host), along with &quot;Wipeout,&quot; &quot;Face the Music,&quot; and &quot;Name That Tune.&quot; In June 1987, the channel debuted another original game show, &quot;Bumper Stumpers&quot; (all four USA original game shows in this era were taped in Canada). When it began, the game-show block ran for an hour, but it expanded significantly the following year. By 1989, the network ran game shows Monday through Fridays from noon to 5:00 p.m. eastern. USA also aired late night reruns of Procter &amp; Gamble soap operas &quot;The Edge Of Night&quot; from August 5, 1985, to January 19, 1989, along with &quot;Search For Tomorrow&quot; from 1987 until the summer of 1989. In January 1989, USA debuted &quot;USA Up All Night,&quot; a showcase of low-budget feature films that aired as part of its weekend overnight schedule. &quot;Up All Night&quot; became a cult favorite among viewers for the comedic wraparound segments that were usually shown during breaks leading into (and sometimes, out of) commercials and between films that were hosted by comedian Gilbert Gottfried and model/actress Rhonda Shear, the latter of whom had replaced original co-host Caroline Schlitt in 1991. Though this program was discontinued on March 7, 1998, late-night movie telecasts on USA continued to be branded under the &quot;Up All Night&quot; banner until 2002.

Short news updates, branded as &quot;USA Updates,&quot; were broadcast early on, from 1989 until 2000. These segments were first produced out of KYW-TV in Philadelphia, as the station had already produced a number of syndicated news services (including the Group W Newsfeed) and Steve Bell, the former newsreader on &quot;Good Morning America,&quot; was employed as a primary anchor at the station. By 1993, production of USA Updates had been taken over by the All News Channel (operated as a joint venture of Hubbard Broadcasting&#x27;s and Viacom&#x27;s CONUS Communications); Bell had left KYW in 1992, when KYW&#x27;s news operations were heavily revamped in response to falling ratings. Via the ANC connection, USA also aired the financial news program &quot;First Business&quot; (then produced by CONUS) at 6:30am weekday mornings for a time (the network had previously carried &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;-produced financial news updates and a late-night report in the 1980s). The ANC-produced updates continued through 2000 (ANC was suffering heavily around this time due to competition with other cable news channels such as CNN and the then-similarly formatted Headline News, and ended up shutting down in 2002); USA Network has not carried any news programming since the news updates were removed.

USA was the first basic cable channel to pre-empt the syndicated television market by purchasing a package of 26 films from Disney&#x27;s Touchstone Pictures library in October 1989. To obtain the package, it spent an estimated $50 million to $60 million, with films including such box office hits as &quot;Dead Poets Society,&quot; &quot;Good Morning, Vietnam,&quot; and &quot;Three Men and a Baby.&quot;

The tradition of game show reruns continued into the 1990s with the &quot;$25,000 and $100,000 Pyramids,&quot; the early 1990s revivals of &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot; and &quot;Tic-Tac-Dough,&quot; and other well-known shows such as &quot;Scrabble,&quot; &quot;Sale of the Century,&quot; &quot;Talk About,&quot; and &quot;Caesars Challenge.&quot; Additionally, two more original game shows were added in June 1994; these were &quot;Free 4 All&quot; and &quot;Quicksilver.&quot; In September 1991, the block was reduced to three hours, from 2:00 to 5:00 p.m. Eastern. However, an additional hour was added in March 1993. In November 1994, the game show block was cut back to only two hours, from 2:00 to 4:00 p.m.

On September 24, 1992, USA launched a sister network, the Sci-Fi Channel (now Syfy), focusing on science fiction series and films.

In January 1993, the channel began showing &quot;WWF Monday Night Raw&quot;, which was the first weekly WWF program on USA to air in front of a live audience. In September 1993, USA adopted a new on-air look centering on the slogan &quot;The Remote Stops Here&quot;, with flat graphics suggesting a television camera&#x27;s in-lens symbols and music consisting of electric guitar and synthesized noises, though the movie presentation openers were retained from the previous design.

===USA Networks ownership (1994–2002)===
In 1994, Paramount Pictures parent Paramount Communications was sold to the original iteration of Viacom; the following year, MCA was acquired by Seagram. In April 1996, Viacom, which also owned MTV Networks, launched a new classic television network called TV Land. MCA subsequently sued Viacom for breach of contract, claiming that it had violated the non-compete clause in its joint venture agreement with MCA. A judge presiding over the case sided with MCA, and Viacom subsequently sold its stake in USA and the Sci-Fi Channel to Seagram for $1.7 billion. In turn, Seagram sold a controlling interest in the networks to Barry Diller – who was previously head of Paramount Pictures when the company owned part of the network in the early 1980s and who was also credited with putting together the 1981 agreement which resulted in joint Paramount-Time-MCA ownership of the network – in February 1998, which led to the creation of USA Networks, Inc.; the company also merged the cable channels with Diller&#x27;s existing television properties including the Home Shopping Network and its broadcasting unit Silver King Broadcasting (which was restructured as USA Broadcasting, and eventually sold its stations to Univision Communications in 2001 to form the nucleus of Telefutura/UniMás).

In July 1995, USA began simulcasting the business news channel Bloomberg Information TV Monday thru Saturday from 5:00 to 7:00 a.m. Eastern; in 2004, the Bloomberg simulcast moved to E!, where it ran until 2007 (USA was actually the second television network to simulcast Bloomberg&#x27;s programming, the now-defunct American Independent Network also carried a simulcast of the channel during the mid-1990s). Bloomberg purchased the airtime from USA. In October 1995, the network dropped the entire game show block; it was replaced with a block called &quot;USA Live&quot;, which carried reruns of &quot;Love Connection&quot; and &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot;, with live hosted wraparound segments between shows; that block was dropped by 1997 (some of the game shows that USA had aired can still be seen on GSN and Buzzr).

On June 17, 1996, the network unveiled a new on-air appearance, which included the introduction of a new logo (incorporating a star ridged into the &quot;U&quot; of the now-serifed &quot;USA&quot; logotype, replacing the Futura-typeface logo that had been in use since the network&#x27;s start under the USA Network name in 1980), and a three-note jingle. Network IDs, feature presentation intros for movies and promo graphics were based around a behind-the-scenes look at the fictional &quot;USA Studios&quot;; some of the IDs showed people in the control room, while a studio that was being set-up by a crew was the backdrop for the &quot;Tonight&quot; menu that displayed the evening&#x27;s schedule. Opening sequences leading into movie telecasts showed people running through the &quot;USA Studios Film Vault&quot;. The new look coincided with a shift in focus, more towards off-network reruns and original programming; game shows and court shows were dropped from the schedule, while cartoons were phased out. USA Studios also became the branding for USA-produced programming at this point. This logo was replaced in July 1999 in favor of a &#x27;USA flag&#x27;-styled logo (whose design was slightly modified in 2002).

In September 1996, USA replaced the &quot;USA Cartoon Express&quot; with the action-oriented children&#x27;s block, &quot;USA Action Extreme Team&quot;; the channel discontinued its animation block outright in September 1998 (other than airing the first-run teen sitcom &quot;USA High&quot; and reruns of &quot;Saved by the Bell: The New Class&quot; from 1997 to 2001, USA has not aired children&#x27;s programming since that time), and replaced it with a block called &quot;USAM&quot;, which advertised itself as &quot;Primetime Comedy in the Morning&quot;. The block mainly featured sitcoms originally aired on network television that were cancelled before making it to 100 episodes (such as &quot;The Jeff Foxworthy Show&quot;, &quot;Hearts Afire&quot; and &quot;Something So Right&quot;); however, for a time, the block also included the 1989–1994 episodes of the Bob Saget run of &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot;. &quot;USAM&quot; was discontinued in 2002; by that point, the only sitcoms airing on USA were daytime and late night reruns of &quot;Martin&quot; and overnight airings of &quot;Living Single&quot;, &quot;Cheers&quot; and &quot;Wings&quot;, with drama series and movies populating much of the channel&#x27;s daytime and primetime schedule.
In 2000, USA Networks bought Canadian media company North American Television, Inc. (a joint partnership between the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and Power Corporation of Canada), owner of cable television channels Trio and Newsworld International (the CBC continued to handle programming responsibilities for NWI until 2005, when eventual USA owner Vivendi sold the channel to a group led by Al Gore, who relaunched it as Current TV). One major shock happened when USA lost the broadcasting rights of the WWF to Viacom in June 2000; &quot;Raw&quot; (which had been retitled &quot;Raw is War&quot;) was moved to TNN in September of that year.

===Vivendi ownership (2002–2004)===
In May 2002, USA Networks sold its non-shopping television and film assets (including USA Network, the Sci-Fi Channel, Trio, USA Films (which was rechristened as Focus Features) and Studios USA) to Vivendi Universal for $10.3 billion. USA and the other channels were folded into Vivendi&#x27;s Universal Television Group.

In July 2002, the channel debuted &quot;Monk&quot;, a comedy-drama police procedural that starred Tony Shalhoub as Adrian Monk, a former San Francisco police inspector-turned-consultant who suffers from various obsessive-compulsive behaviors that include the ability to pay attention to detail when solving crimes. It became one of USA Network&#x27;s first breakout hit series, and ran for eight seasons until it ended on December 4, 2009.

===NBCUniversal/Comcast ownership (2004–present)===
In 2003, General Electric (GE) agreed to merge NBC and its sibling companies with Vivendi Universal&#x27;s North American-based filmed entertainment assets, including Universal Pictures and Universal Television Group in a multibillion-dollar purchase, renaming the merged company NBC Universal. GE retained an 80% ownership stake in the new company, while Vivendi retained a 20% stake. NBC Universal officially took over as owner of USA and its sibling cable channels (except for Newsworld International) in 2004. That year, USA premiered the sci-fi series &quot;The 4400&quot;.

===&quot;Characters Welcome&quot;, the &quot;blue sky&quot; era (2005–2016)===
In 2005, USA Network introduced a new logo and associated marketing campaign, &quot;Characters Welcome&quot;. The slogan was designed to help emphasize the wide range of programming the network offered, and to help USA Network establish itself more prominently as a brand. The launch of the campaign featured promos themed around the daily lives of characters from the network&#x27;s programs. To contrast itself from the &quot;grittier&quot; offerings of other mainstream cable networks, USA Network&#x27;s original programming during this era was marked by a focus on comedic and &quot;optimistic&quot; action and drama series, referred to as a &quot;blue sky&quot; approach. Notable examples of this programming strategy included &quot;Psych&quot; (2006), &quot;Burn Notice&quot; (2007), and &quot;Royal Pains&quot; (2009). In October 2005, &quot;Raw&quot; returned to USA Network after Viacom did not renew its broadcasting agreement with the WWE.

On May 13, 2007 (in advance of NBC&#x27;s 2007–08 fall upfronts presentation), NBC Universal announced that new episodes of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; would be moved to USA Network beginning with the drama&#x27;s seventh season in the fall of 2007; episodes would then be re-aired later in the season on NBC, most likely to shore up any programming holes created by the cancellation of a failed new series. Although this is not the first time a broadcast series has moved to cable (USA had acquired first-run rights to the revival of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; from NBC in 1987, while &quot;The Paper Chase&quot; had moved beforehand from CBS to Showtime in 1983), it marked the first time that a series which moved its first-run episodes from broadcast to cable television would continue to air episodes on a broadcast network while it was still a first-run program. On December 7, 2007, it was announced that USA Network would continue broadcasting first-run episodes of &quot;Raw&quot; through at least 2010.

The June 1, 2008, premiere of &quot;In Plain Sight&quot;, starring Mary McCormack, was USA&#x27;s highest-rated series premiere since the 2006 debut of &quot;Psych&quot;, with 5.3 million viewers. In early 2009, USA Network acquired the network television rights for 24 recent and upcoming Universal Pictures films, including &quot;Duplicity&quot;, &quot;Funny People&quot;, &quot;Frost/Nixon&quot;, &quot;Land of the Lost&quot;, &quot;Milk&quot;, and &quot;State of Play&quot;.

In 2011, control and majority ownership of then-parent NBC Universal passed from General Electric to Comcast. Comcast would buy out GE&#x27;s remaining ownership in NBCU two years later. USA Network was considered the key piece of the NBC-Comcast merger; Wunderlich Securities analyst Matthew Harrigan projected that USA contributed $9.5 billion to NBCUniversal&#x27;s $44.8 billion value, with NBC contributing only $408 million. In 2014, the channel had dropped 18% in viewership and out of first place among the major cable channels. USA has been a key NBCUniversal asset accounting for one-third of advertising revenue for NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment Group and $1 billion in annual earnings over the past few years.

In April 2015, it was announced that &quot;WWE SmackDown&quot; would move to USA from sister network Syfy.

===End of the &quot;blue sky&quot; era, expansion of sports coverage (2016–present)===
In April 2016, USA Network unveiled a new branding campaign and slogan, &quot;We the Bold&quot;. The campaign was designed to reflect the channel&#x27;s current focus on &quot;rich, captivating stories about unlikely heroes who defy the status quo, push boundaries and are willing to risk everything for what they believe in&quot;. USA had quietly discontinued the &quot;Characters Welcome&quot; tagline in the lead-up to the rebranding, whose associated programming shift was led by the premieres of &quot;Mr. Robot&quot; and &quot;Colony&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; reported that the new programming strategy was designed to appeal to themes of &quot;authenticity, resiliency, bravery and innovation&quot;. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; felt that the re-branding symbolically marked the end of USA&#x27;s &quot;blue sky&quot; era, as the channel had been increasingly producing more &quot;intense&quot; series with darker themes. NBCUniversal marketing executive Alexandra Shapiro explained that the &quot;Characters Welcome&quot; campaign and associated programming was reflective of the &quot;weirdly optimistic&quot; mood of the network&#x27;s key demographic at the time.

In August 2016, NBCUniversal acquired the television rights to the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film franchise from 2018 through 2025, including the main film series and their spin-offs (with the first, &quot;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them&quot;, to have its cable premiere in 2019), and other content. On cable, the films are to primarily be aired by USA Network and Syfy, and the deal also includes the ability for Universal Parks &amp; Resorts to offer &quot;exclusive content and events&quot; related to the franchise (Universal Parks had already been involved in &quot;The Wizarding World of Harry Potter&quot; attractions). The deal succeeded one with Freeform; &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported the deal was valued around $250 million over the length of the agreement, making it one of the highest-valued film franchise deals. To launch the new rights, Syfy and USA both aired &quot;Harry Potter&quot; marathons over the July 13–15, 2018 weekend, airing all eight films (including directors&#x27; cuts of the first six) with limited commercial interruption.

Amid the growth of streaming services (including NBCUniversal&#x27;s newly launched Peacock) and the decline of traditional cable television, USA Network began to cut back on scripted programming, in favor of reality shows, television events (including scripted miniseries), and live programming—the latter including WWE programs and sporting events. In 2020, the network cancelled &quot;Dare Me&quot;, &quot;The Purge&quot;, &quot;The Sinner&quot;, and &quot;Treadstone&quot;. With the announcement that NBCSN would shut down on December 31, 2021, it was subsequently revealed that USA and Peacock would collectively assume its remaining sports broadcasts.

In December 2023, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; reported that USA Network was considering a return to original scripted series in the vein of the &quot;blue sky&quot; era, citing the recent resurgence in the popularity of &quot;Suits&quot; (which concluded in 2019) after the series was acquired by Netflix that year.

==Programming==

USA Network has achieved a viewership foothold with its original programming; this began in the 1990s with initial hits such as &quot;Silk Stalkings&quot;, &quot;Duckman&quot; and &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot;, which were gradually followed in the following two decades by series such as &quot;Monk&quot;, &quot;Psych&quot;, &quot;Shooter&quot;, &quot;White Collar&quot;, &quot;Mr. Robot&quot;, &quot;Suits&quot;, &quot;Burn Notice&quot; and &quot;Royal Pains&quot;.

In addition to its original productions, the network airs syndicated reruns of current and former network series such as &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, &quot;Chicago P.D.&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; (which spent the final four seasons of its run as a first-run program on USA) and &quot;NCIS&quot;. The network also broadcasts a variety of films from the Universal Pictures library and select films from other movie studios (such as Sony Pictures Entertainment, Paramount Pictures, Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures and Warner Bros. Entertainment), airing primarily as part of its overnight and weekend schedule, and occasionally during primetime on nights when original programming or marathons of its acquired programs are not scheduled.

===Sports programming===
USA Network has a longstanding history with sports, dating back to its existence as the Madison Square Garden Network. The network carried Major League Baseball games on Thursday nights from 1979 to 1983, and the &quot;NHL on USA&quot; ran from 1979 to 1985. &quot;College Football on USA&quot; ran from 1980 to 1986, and its telecast of the 1981 Liberty Bowl was the first college bowl game to be exclusively broadcast on cable television. The &quot;NBA on USA&quot; also aired from 1979 to 1984, the first time that the NBA had a cable television partner.

For 17 years from 1981 to 1998, USA aired a weekly boxing show, &quot;USA Tuesday Night Fights&quot;, which showcased bouts featuring up-and-coming boxers. &quot;Tennis on USA&quot; aired professional tournaments in the United States from 1984 to 2008, and was the longtime cable home of the US Open before its cable television rights moved to ESPN2 and the Tennis Channel in 2009. The &quot;PGA Tour on USA&quot; covered the opening two rounds of the Masters Tournament from 1982 to 2007, Ryder Cup matches from 1989 to 2010, and various other events.

The USA Network aired most games of the NFL-run World League of American Football (later NFL Europe/Europa) in its first two seasons of operation in 1991 and 1992; one innovation introduced for the network&#x27;s WLAF telecasts was the in-helmet camera.

Upon the 2004 purchase of Vivendi Universal by NBC, USA&#x27;s sports division was immediately merged into NBC Sports. Since 2004, the network has broadcast select events from the Olympic Games, as part of an expansion of NBCUniversal&#x27;s broadcast rights to the Summer and Winter Olympics that allowed several of the company&#x27;s cable channels rights to telecast Olympic events live (some of which are later re-aired on tape delay on NBC as part of the network&#x27;s primetime and late night Olympic coverage). USA Network also carried games from the International Ice Hockey Federation in 2006 and 2010.

During the 2014 Winter Olympics, USA aired Premier League soccer matches in lieu of sister channel NBCSN, due to that channel&#x27;s full devotion to carrying coverage of Olympic events. After ratings success with those matches, USA began to air mid-afternoon Saturday games weekly during the 2015–16 season. USA also participates in NBC Sports&#x27; broader effort of carrying all ten Survival Sunday matches across its numerous channels during the final matchday of the Premier League season. Starting in 2015, USA Network was similarly incorporated into NBC&#x27;s coverage of the Stanley Cup Playoffs. In 2016, USA aired three NASCAR races as overflow during the 2016 Summer Olympics.

In September 2020, a Notre Dame Fighting Irish football game was scheduled for USA Network due to NBC&#x27;s commitments to the 2020 U.S. Open. Coverage of a primetime game against Clemson on November 7, 2020, was also briefly moved from NBC to USA Network due to NBC News coverage of a victory speech by president-elect Joe Biden.

With the shutdown of NBCSN at the end of 2021, USA Network once again became the main cable outlet of NBC Sports in 2022, with sports properties such as the Premier League, NASCAR, and the Olympics (including U.S. Olympic trials) moving to USA at this time. The U.S. Open, U.S. Women&#x27;s Open, The Open Championship, and the Women&#x27;s Open would move their early-round telecasts from Golf Channel to USA beginning in 2022. USA Network also carried eight games as part of the inaugural season of the revived USFL, and is one of the broadcast partners of the SuperMotocross World Championship and its Supercross and Motocross feeder series.

From 1984 to 2016, USA Network was the longtime home of the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show.

=== Professional wrestling ===
USA Network is also the home of the professional wrestling company WWE. WWE (formerly WWF) has had a longstanding relationship with USA Network going back to 1977 when broadcasts of Madison Square Garden events would air on USA Network. The first weekly WWE show on USA Network debuted on September 4, 1983, with &quot;WWF All American Wrestling&quot;. &quot;WWF Prime Time Wrestling&quot; broadcast on USA Network from 1985 to 1993 until it was superseded by WWE&#x27;s flagship cable program &quot;Raw&quot;. The series originally aired on USA Network from its debut in January 1993 (when the promotion was known as the World Wrestling Federation) until the series moved to TNN in September 2000, before returning to USA Network in October 2005. 

On January 7, 2016, WWE&#x27;s second flagship program &quot;SmackDown&quot; moved to USA Network from Syfy. In 2018, USA Network renewed its rights to &quot;Raw&quot; for five additional years, but lost the rights for &quot;SmackDown&quot; to Fox beginning in October 2019. In August 2019, WWE announced that its tertiary weekly program &quot;WWE NXT&quot; would return to USA Network on September 18, 2019, airing on Wednesday nights in a two-hour live format.

In September 2023, it was announced that &quot;SmackDown&quot; would return to USA in 2024 under a five-year deal with NBCUniversal, which would also include a slate of four annual primetime specials on NBC per-year. In November 2023, it was then announced that &quot;NXT&quot; would move to The CW, and in January 2024 it was announced that &quot;Raw&quot; would move to Netflix in 2025.

==High definition==
High-definition simulcasts of USA Network sports coverage, and reruns of original programs produced in the format, were originally carried by Universal HD. In 2007, USA Network launched a HD feed.

==International==

===Canada===

In February 2007, Shaw Communications submitted an application to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), to carry the USA Network in Canada as a foreign service that would be eligible for carriage by domestic cable and satellite providers (and to automatically allow all English-language general interest cable networks from the United States into Canada). However, because of programming rights issues with other Canadian specialty channels, certain programs would be subjected to blackout restrictions, including &quot;WWE Raw&quot;.

In September 2007, the CRTC refused Shaw&#x27;s request to carry USA Network in Canada on the basis that the channel carried too much programming that overlapped with the English language digital cable specialty channel Mystery TV (which is then owned by Canwest – later Shaw Media – and formerly, Groupe TVA). However, on September 20, the CRTC stated that it would reconsider their denial of the eligible foreign carriage proposal for USA Network at a later date, when Shaw instead offered to carry the channel on the digital cable tiers of its Shaw Cable systems. In spite of this, the CRTC has since rejected the restructured proposal on the basis that USA&#x27;s programming would be competitive with Mystery TV.

On October 17, 2024, NBCUniversal announced an agreement with Bell Media to launch a Canadian version of USA Network on January 1, 2025. The channel is a relaunch of Bell&#x27;s Discovery Channel, following that company&#x27;s loss of rights to the former Discovery, Inc. channel brands to Rogers Communications. This iteration of USA Network will still be maintained by CTV Specialty Television—a joint venture of Bell Media and ESPN Inc.—stemming from the channel having originally been established by the ownership group of sister sports network TSN; and Warner Bros. Discovery (who also owns 20% of the channel). The new channel will also mirror some of USA Network&#x27;s sports offerings via content sublicensed from TSN, including All Elite Wrestling and NASCAR Xfinity Series coverage. Even with the pivot to a general entertainment format, some of the original factual programming it aired as Discovery (including documentary series &quot;Mayday&quot; and reality show &quot;Highway Thru Hell&quot;) remain on USA Network&#x27;s schedule.

===Latin America===
Regional versions of USA Network previously operated in certain Latin American countries (such as Argentina and Brazil); in September 2004, most of these services were renamed under the Universal Channel banner to take advantage of the more well-known brand, and to reduce the awkwardness of a channel branded with the initials of another nation.

In 2023 it was announced by NBCUniversal that the channel will be revived in Latin America during the Q4 of 2023 after 19 years of absence in the region. The channel will broadcast dramas like &quot;Briarpatch&quot; and &quot;Dr. Death,&quot; also the channel will be the official broadcaster of the Miss Universe pageant which was broadcast on November 18. USA Network was relaunched on October 1, 2023, replacing Syfy in the region.

<text>DeKalb County is a county in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of Alabama. As of the 2020 census, the population was 71,608. Its county seat is Fort Payne, and it is named after Major General Baron Johann de Kalb. DeKalb County is part of the Huntsville-Decatur-Albertville, AL Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
DeKalb County was created by the Alabama legislature on January 9, 1836, from land ceded under duress to the Federal government by the Cherokee Nation prior to their forced removal to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River.

The county was named for Major General Baron Johann de Kalb, a hero of the American Revolution.

The city of Fort Payne, now the county seat, developed around a fort of the same name, built in the 1830s to intern Cherokee of the region prior to their removal.

In the early 19th century, Sequoyah, the Cherokee man who independently created the Cherokee syllabary, a written system for his language, lived in this area. He had been born in a Cherokee town in Tennessee and migrated here in the early 1800s. His work enabled the Cherokee to publish the first Native American newspaper, &quot;The Phoenix&quot;, which they produced in Cherokee and English.

On the whole, DeKalb County is a dry county in terms of alcohol sales and consumption. In 2005, the city of Fort Payne passed a law to authorize the legal sale of alcohol. Collinsville and Henagar later also allowed alcohol sales.

==21st-century natural events==
The county&#x27;s eastern edge, along the state line, was the epicenter of an earthquake on April 29, 2003, measuring 4.6 on the moment magnitude scale. Power was knocked out in the area, mirrors and pictures thrown to the floor, foundations cracked, and one chimney fell to the ground. The unusual earthquake for this region was felt over a significant portion of the southeastern states, including quite strongly in northeastern Alabama and neighboring northern Georgia, and nearby eastern Tennessee (especially near Chattanooga). It was also felt slightly in western upstate South Carolina, far west-southwestern North Carolina, south and southeastern Kentucky, and east-northeastern Mississippi.

DeKalb County had one of the highest death tolls in Alabama during a massive tornadic system in April 27, 2011, the 2011 Super Outbreak. A total of 31 deaths were reported in the county, 25 of them being a result of the 2011 Rainsville tornado, the last EF5 of the outbreak..

In a strange turn of events, a local farmer, George Howard confessed in court to the killing and named five other local men as killers. Three men were convicted in the killing and sentenced to ten years in prison. On 9 June 1902, they were pardoned by Governor Jelks. In 1915 another Black man was taken from the local jail and murdered.

<text>Decatur County was a county of the state of Alabama, United States. It was named for Commodore Stephen Decatur of the United States Navy. Its county seat was Woodville.

==History==
Decatur County was established by the Alabama Legislature on December 17, 1821. In 1822, Woodville was selected as the county seat. Several years later, however, a survey showed the county did not have the minimum constitutional area, and so Decatur County was abolished on December 28, 1825 and divided between Madison County and Jackson County. The section added to Madison County was known informally for many years as &quot;New Madison&quot;.

<text>William Morris Davis (February 12, 1850 – February 5, 1934) was an American geographer, geologist, geomorphologist, and meteorologist, often called the &quot;father of American geography&quot;.

He was born into a prominent Quaker family in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, son of Edward M. Davis and Maria Mott Davis (a daughter of the women&#x27;s advocate Lucretia Mott). Davis studied geology and geography at Harvard&#x27;s Lawrence Scientific School and then joined the Harvard sponsored geographic exploration party to the Colorado territory, led by the inaugural Sturgis-Hooper professor of geology, Josiah Dwight Whitney. Wild stories had circulated since soon after the Louisiana Purchase about Rocky Mountains peaks 18,000 feet or higher. The Harvard expedition set out to investigate, and found none, but they did find &quot;14ers&quot; (14,000-plus feet). He graduated from Harvard University in 1869 and received a Master of Mining Engineering in the following year. Davis worked for Nathaniel Shaler as a field assistant, and was later hired to teach at Harvard. Though his legacy lives on in geomorphology, he also advanced theories of scientific racism in his writings about physical geography.

After his first wife died, Davis married Mary M. Wyman from Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1914, and, after her death, he married Lucy L. Tennant from Milton, Massachusetts 
in 1928, who survived him.

He died in Pasadena, California, shortly before his 84th birthday. His Cambridge home is a National Historic Landmark.

==Scientific career==
===Meteorology===
Davis initially worked in Córdoba, Argentina as a meteorologist for three years and after working as an assistant to Nathaniel Shaler, he became an instructor in geology at Harvard, in 1879. The same year he married Ellen B. Warner from Springfield, Massachusetts. While Davis never completed his PhD, he was appointed to his first full professorship in 1890 and remained in academia and teaching throughout his life.

===Cycle of erosion theory===
Davis was a tenacious, as well as keen observer of nature, a master of logical deduction, and a brilliant synthesizer of disparate observations and ideas. From his own field observations and studies made by the original nineteenth-century surveyors of the western United States, he devised his most influential scientific contribution:the &quot;geographical cycle&quot;. His theory first defined in his 1889 article, &quot;The Rivers and Valleys of Pennsylvania&quot;, which was a model of how rivers erode uplifted land to base level, was inspired by the work of Erasmus and Charles Darwin and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, and it had a strong evolutionary flavor. His cycle of erosion suggests that (larger) rivers have three main stages of development, generally divided into youthful, mature and old-age stages. Each stage has distinct landforms and other properties associated with them, which can occur along the length of a river&#x27;s upper, middle, and lower course.

Though the cycle of erosion was a crucial early contribution to the development of geomorphology, many of Davis&#x27; theories regarding landscape evolution, sometimes termed &#x27;Davisian geomorphology&#x27;, were heavily criticized by later geomorphologists. When Davis retired from Harvard in 1911, the study of landscape evolution was nearly monopolized by his theories. It was characteristic of Davis to react violently and disdainfully to criticism, particularly to the German criticism in the 1920s headed by Walther Penck; it was also his characteristic to choose to attack the most vulnerable points of that criticism. Since that time, with a less dogmatic approach and greater knowledge, some authors note that Penck&#x27;s and Davis&#x27; ideas have become more compatible and even complementary since the advent of modern tectonic theory. They claim that Davis&#x27; ideas are more applicable near active margins where tectonics are &quot;cataclysmic&quot;, and Penck&#x27;s ideas fit better in models of passive margins and continental platforms.

=== Contributions to physical geography and scientific racism ===
Davis was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1884 and the American Philosophical Society in 1899. He was a founder of the Association of American Geographers in 1904, elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences that same year, and heavily involved with the National Geographic Society in its early years, writing a number of articles for the magazine. Davis retired from Harvard in 1911. He served as president of the Geological Society of America in 1911. He was awarded the Patron&#x27;s Medal of the Royal Geographical Society in 1919.

His textbook, &quot;Elementary Physical Geography&quot; (1902), includes a chapter entitled &quot;The Distribution of Plants, Animals, and Man,&quot; in which Davis details how the physical geography of landscapes influences &quot;the progress of man from the savage toward the civilized state.&quot; Davis concludes that &quot;the leading nations of [the European] race are the most advanced peoples in the world&quot; and &quot;few nations among [black, brown, and red] races have made important advances towards civilization.&quot; This textbook chapter exemplifies how Davis promulgated theories of scientific racism, and was likely influenced by mentor and colleague Nathaniel Shaler, who published similar views on the subject. Davis borrowed from Darwinian biological concepts and applied these to physical landscapes and climates in a type of Social Darwinistic thought termed &quot;environmental determinism&quot;. His work influenced geographer and writer Elsworth Huntington, a student of Davis at Harvard, who attempted to explain differences in human culture by climate and geography, for example comparing communities of British descent in Canada and the Bahamas and suggesting that Anglo Bahamians are slower because of climate and proximity to black people.

==Legacy==
The valley of Davisdalen in Nathorst Land at Spitsbergen, Svalbard is named after him.

<text>The Weather Channel (TWC) is an American pay television channel owned by Weather Group, LLC, a subsidiary of Allen Media Group. The channel&#x27;s headquarters are located in Atlanta, Georgia. Launched on May 2, 1982, the channel broadcasts weather forecasts and weather-related news and analysis, along with documentaries and entertainment programming related to weather. A sister network, Weatherscan, was a digital cable and satellite service that offered 24-hour automated local forecasts and radar imagery. Weatherscan was officially shut down on December 12, 2022. The Weather Channel also produces outsourced weathercasts, notably for CBS News and RFD-TV.

, the Weather Channel is available to approximately 68 million pay television households in the United States-down from its 2013 peak of 101 million households.

In August 2023, it was announced that IBM was selling the Weather Company and its assets to the Francisco Partners.

==History==
The Weather Channel was founded on July 18, 1980, by television meteorologist John Coleman (who had served as a chief meteorologist at ABC owned-and-operated station WLS-TV in Chicago and as a forecaster for &quot;Good Morning America&quot;) and Frank Batten, then-president of the channel&#x27;s original owner Landmark Communications (now Landmark Media Enterprises). The channel launched at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time on May 2, 1982. Originally, regional and local information was obtained from the National Weather Service for broadcast. Since 2002, all forecasting has been done on-site in Atlanta.

=== NBCUniversal, Bain, and Blackstone ownership ===
On January 3, 2008, Landmark Communications put the Weather Channel and its assets up for sale. On July 6, 2008, NBC Universal, Bain Capital, and Blackstone Group agreed to jointly purchase the Weather Channel from Landmark, making it the channel&#x27;s first ownership change in 26 years. The sale was finalized on September 12, 2008.

NBC Universal also owned NBC Weather Plus, a rival service which was carried by and featured content from the NBC television network&#x27;s local network affiliates; that service announced its discontinuation three months later. Over-the-air digital subchannels carrying Weather Plus have since switched to the similarly formatted the Local AccuWeather Channel, kept the Weather Plus engine, or switched affiliations to other networks such as This TV or the Retro Television Network; some have shut down entirely.

From November 2008 to February 2009, the Weather Channel laid off seven long-time on-camera meteorologists: Kristina Abernathy, Eboni Deon, Kristin Dodd, Rich Johnson, Cheryl Lemke, Mark Mancuso and Dave Schwartz (Schwartz would return to TWC in April 2014, but died of cancer on July 30, 2016). With the exception of Deon, all had been on the air for more than ten years, and three of them had been employed by the network for more than twenty years.

In July 2010, the Weather Channel terminated Bill Keneely, the last of the original on-camera meteorologists who appeared on the network&#x27;s first broadcasts in 1982. In December of that year, the network also laid off on-camera meteorologist Nicole Mitchell, who later would file a lawsuit against the Weather Channel in 2012, alleging that she had been terminated because the channel&#x27;s new owners disapproved of the time required by her simultaneous duties as a captain in the U.S. Air Force Reserve as one of the &quot;Hurricane Hunters&quot; team; such reserve duties are protected by U.S. law (Mitchell later served as the chief meteorologist at Al Jazeera America, which for a time also employed Eboni Deon).

Inevitably, the merger of NBC on-air meteorologists began in May 2009. Former NBC Weather Plus meteorologist Todd Santos joined the Weather Channel on May 2 of that year. Al Roker of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; began hosting a one-hour morning program called &quot;Wake Up With Al&quot;, alongside meteorologist Stephanie Abrams later in the summer.

However, for New York City-based forecasting operations (those utilized for forecasts on MSNBC and CNBC, for instance), the former NBC Weather Plus forecasting, radar and graphics systems remain in place, with banners changed to fit the Weather Channel&#x27;s graphics scheme. On September 10, 2009, the Weather Channel co-founder Frank Batten died.

==== 2012 to 2018 ====
In January 2012, David Kenny took over as chief executive officer of the Weather Channel, replacing former AOL executive Mike Kelly, who had been appointed as the company&#x27;s CEO in the summer of 2009. Although all operations, sales support and marketing and the bulk of employees are located in the headquarters in Atlanta, Kenny declined to move there, and continues to live in Boston as a remote worker.

Later in 2012, the Weather Channel&#x27;s holding company changed its name from the Weather Channel Companies to the Weather Company. The company also purchased competing weather service and website Weather Underground the same year. On March 10, 2015, Verizon FiOS dropped the Weather Channel and WeatherScan for their rival AccuWeather.

On September 9, 2015, the channel announced a phased overhaul of its programming schedule during 2016, in which the channel would gradually shift its focus back towards a forecast-based lineup. The channel cancelled &quot;Wake Up with Al&quot;, citing high production costs in New York City compared to Atlanta. It announced that &quot;AMHQ&quot; would be refocused on weather, eliminating lifestyle segments, with Stephanie Abrams becoming host and original host Sam Champion as a contributor for its prime time schedule starting November 2.

The network also announced it would no longer greenlight original long-form programming, and expanded live forecast programming on its schedule throughout 2016 after all remaining long-form programs already in development concluded their runs. In a memo sent out to network staff by Weather Company CEO David Kenny, it explained its refocus on weather-based programs was done so that &quot;our most passionate fans come to us for the weather and the science behind the weather, not our original shows.&quot; Around 50 TWC employees–including production, engineering, and financial staff–were laid off, and the television channel&#x27;s budget was reduced to shift resources to the company&#x27;s Internet and mobile properties.

The channel&#x27;s original format was similar to that of a news and information cable network. Since the creation of the series &quot;Atmospheres&quot; in 2000 and &quot;Storm Stories&quot; in 2003, the Weather Channel had seen a gradual transition toward a mix of weather forecasting and weather-related entertainment programming that paralleled the launch of sister network Weatherscan, the evolution of the always-on &quot;L&quot; bar/weather ticker, the development of weather.com and popular branded mobile phone applications, and the increased viewing and interest in documentary programs on the topic of weather.

In November 2013, the channel introduced a new initiative of &quot;weather all the time&quot; in response to the criticism. All original programming–which was rebranded under the tagline &quot;Natural Drama&quot; – now had direct relevance to weather-related subjects, and the network emphasized its promise to interrupt original programming either regionally or nationally during major weather events. In addition, the Weather Channel extended the display of its lower display line (which was revamped with a new graphics package) to commercial breaks and through entire broadcasts of its original programs.

In August 2015, reports surfaced that the Weather Company&#x27;s owners were considering a sale of all or part of the venture, having hired Morgan Stanley and PJT Partners to explore their options. On October 28, 2015, it was announced that IBM would acquire most of the Weather Company&#x27;s assets, including weather.com, Weather Underground, the related mobile applications, and their underlying data platforms, for an undisclosed amount.

IBM planned to leverage its Watson technology as part of the acquisition, foreseeing its use for weather analytics and predictions. The deal, which closed the following January, does not include the Weather Channel itself, which remained owned by the Bain/Blackstone/NBCUniversal consortium, and entered into a long-term licensing agreement with IBM for use of its weather data and &quot;The Weather Channel&quot; name and branding.

=== Allen Media Group ownership ===

In August 2016, reports surfaced that Sinclair Broadcast Group had expressed interest in acquiring ownership of the Weather Channel.

On March 22, 2018, Byron Allen&#x27;s Entertainment Studios announced its acquisition of the Weather Channel&#x27;s television assets from the NBCUniversal/Bain/Blackstone partnership. The actual value is undisclosed, but was reported to be around $300 million. The channel&#x27;s non-television assets, which were separately sold to IBM two years prior, were not included in the sale.

In the early morning of April 18, 2019, the Weather Channel was temporarily unable to air live programming due to what they called a &quot;malicious software attack&quot; on their network. Previously taped shows were aired while engineers worked with backup equipment, and live programming returned to normal within a few hours (at the time, &quot;AMHQ&quot;). The perpetrators of the malware attack were never identified.

In May 2022, on the Weather Channel&#x27;s 40th birthday, it launched a new direct-to-consumer subscription-based app.

In August 2023, IBM announced it will be selling its weather unit and the Weather Channel&#x27;s subsidiaries and apps to the Francisco Partners. As a part of the deal, IBM will retain the company&#x27;s weather data which it uses to power artificial intelligence models to sell its enterprise clients for NASA.

In January 2025, Allen Media Group announced plans to have local weather coverage on its sister Allen Media Broadcasting television stations be centralized from TWC and its Atlanta studios, including use of its meteorologists and forecasting technology. AMG argued that this change would &quot;dramatically improve reporting capabilities, especially in high-stakes weather situations&quot; and provide &quot;additional visual storytelling capabilities&quot;. The change will result in planned layoffs of meteorologists from stations across 21 media markets, with some being reassigned to work from Atlanta. AMG&#x27;s announcement faced criticism over how it would impact severe weather coverage, along with the plan to lay off meteorologists with strong connections to their respective communities. WBMA chief meteorologist James Spann stated that he &quot;hate[d] that so many colleagues are involved in this&quot;, but admitted that &quot;media consumption is radically different now, and we have to change how our products and services reach you&quot;. On January 23, 2025, it was reported that AMG had elected to maintain some of its local meteorologists instead, citing feedback and criticism over the announcement.

=== International versions ===
Over the years, attempts to broadcast international versions of TWC–apart from the Australian version of the Weather Channel (now Sky News Weather Channel)–have failed. TWC operates websites that provide localized forecasts in Brazil, France, Germany, India, Latin America and the United Kingdom, but some of these sites may not have developed since 2003. The Weather Channel shares radar imagery and forecasts with the Weather Network/MétéoMédia in Canada, particularly for the Weather Channel&#x27;s Canadian forecasts.
* A U.K. version of the Weather Channel operated from September 1, 1996, to January 30, 1998, when it was shut down due to low viewership. On satellite, it broadcast for five hours each day, from 6 am until 11 am. It shared channel space with Sky Movies Gold/Sky Box Office 2, The Racing Channel and Galavision. On cable, it was generally on air for 24 hours but it was only carried by some companies as others chose to carry rival service the Weather Network which also launched in the UK in 1996. Both were designed for cable as it had local weather information for specific regions.
* TWC formerly operated The Weather Channel Latin America, a Spanish-language network serving Mexico, Puerto Rico and South America. This network launched in 1996 and an accompanying Brazilian Portuguese-language feed launched in 1998. It ceased operations on December 20, 2002, due to budget cuts. The channel&#x27;s three original on-camera weather presenters were Paola Elorza, Sal Morales, and Mari Carmen Ramos; all three left the channel within a year of its launch and respectively went on to work for Univision in Miami, Telemundo in Los Angeles, and CNN International in Atlanta.

== Ratings and reception ==
, the Weather Channel was received by approximately 79.128 million households that subscribe to a pay television service throughout the United States. Americans regard the Weather Channel as the most trustworthy media organization, according to a 2022 poll by &quot;The Economist&quot; and YouGov.

==Local on the 8s==
Local on the 8s (or the Local Forecast) is a program segment that airs on the American network the Weather Channel. It provides viewers with information on current and forecasted weather conditions for their respective area; a version of this segment is also available on the channel&#x27;s national satellite feed that features forecasts for each region of the United States. The name comes from the timing of the segment, as airs at time slots that end in &quot;8&quot; (examples: 9:18 and 12:48); because of this manner of scheduling, the forecast segments air on the channel in ten-minute intervals. From 2006-2013, each forecast segment had usually been preceded by a promo for one of the Weather Channel&#x27;s programs or services, leading into the segment with the announcer stating &quot;And now, your &quot;Local on the 8s&quot;&quot;. On November 12, 2013, the promo segment was replaced by an intro that was built into the &quot;Local on the 8s&quot; segment. As of April 2018, the segment airs at approximately :18 past each hour. It also usually airs at approximately :48 past each hour during live Weather Channel broadcasts. On July 11, 2023, the music for Local on the 8s was replaced with band and jazz music.

TWC also maintains content partnerships with a number of local U.S. radio stations to provide local forecasts, using announcers separate from the meteorologists seen on the television channel. For some affiliates, the Weather Channel provides a limited amount of live coverage during local severe weather events (with the Georgia-based announcers connected via ISDN). Distribution of TWC radio content is currently handled by Westwood One.

Similarly, the Weather Channel also provides weather reports for a number of newspapers around the United States. This included a half-page national forecast for &quot;USA Today&quot;, for which TWC provided content until September 2012, when rival AccuWeather replaced the Weather Channel as the paper&#x27;s forecast provider.

==== 2022 ====
On March 28, 2022, TWC announced a content partnership with CBS News, under which it will provide weather reports on &quot;CBS Mornings&quot;, the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, and the CBS News streaming network, as well as collaborate on investigative journalism relating to weather and climate.

On May 2, 2022, the Weather Channel en Español launched on Local Now as TWC celebrates their 40th anniversary. TWC en Español has 24/7 coverage. Milmar Ramírez, Henry Golac, Jessica Fernández, Lorena Lim, Albert Martínez, and Abel Hernández leads the team.

==== 2024 ====
It was confirmed by Charter Spectrum that the Weather Channel en Español will cease programming on December 31, 2024.

===Online services===
TWC provided numerous customized forecasts for online users through its website, weather.com, including home and garden, and event planning forecasts. Third-party web analytics providers Alexa and SimilarWeb rated the site as the 146th and 244th most visited website in the world respectively, as of July 2015. SimilarWeb rates the site as the second most visited weather website globally, attracting more than 126 million visitors per month.

It also provided WAP access for mobile phone users, desktop widgets for quick reference by computer users, and customized weather feeds for individual websites. Cell phone customers could also receive local forecasts from TWC sent to their mobile handsets via SMS by sending a text message with their ZIP code to 42278 (which spells &quot;4cast&quot;). The Weather Channel also provided weather forecasts for other online services including Yahoo!.

In addition, the Weather Channel maintained apps for the iPhone, iPad, Android, Apple TV, Kindle Fire, and Windows mobile and tablet platforms. TWC formerly maintained two versions of its mobile applications: a free version that incorporates advertising and a pay version called &quot;TWC Max&quot; that does not feature advertising, the latter was discontinued in favor of an all ad-supported model on January 6, 2014. Aside from location-based weather forecast information, the apps provided radar maps, and tropical and seasonal updates, as well as social media related functions that track weather-related Twitter messages and allow users to send Facebook friends severe weather alerts. The channel also disseminated severe weather information, and photos and videos submitted by meteorologists and viewers, on its Twitter feed (@TWCBreaking, which also served as a hashtag usable for posts).

In July 2012, the Weather Company (former owner of the Weather Channel) purchased competing weather website Weather Underground. While the Weather Channel already had success with its own mobile apps, it planned to use Weather Underground&#x27;s large network of digital forecasting and tracking websites to bolster its digital growth. Weather Underground operates separately from the Weather Channel and continues to provide its own forecasts, though its website incorporates some weather news and video content from TWC.

The website weather.com and most of the Weather Channel&#x27;s digital assets were sold to IBM in January 2016. The Weather Channel as a television operation used weloveweather.tv but this website was shut down in 2023. . Company information can be found on weathergroup.com

==Programming==

Weather forecast programming made up TWC&#x27;s entire schedule prior to its incorporation of weather-related original programming – referred in network promotional materials and press releases as &quot;long-form programming&quot; – in 2000 (with few breakaways from its forecast programs prior to then, outside of educational program &quot;The Weather Classroom&quot;, an original program produced as part of the cable television industry&#x27;s Cable in the Classroom initiative). The number of hours devoted to TWC&#x27;s in-studio forecast programs has steadily eroded since then. The network&#x27;s live studio programs are aired regularly from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time on weekdays and from 6:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time on weekends and holidays. &quot;America&#x27;s Morning Headquarters&quot; airs weekdays between 6:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time, followed by &quot;The Weather Channel LIVE&quot;, which airs from 2:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. Eastern followed by &quot;Weather Unfiltered&quot;, which airs from 6:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. Eastern. On weekends, &quot;America&#x27;s Weekend Headquarters&quot; from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m., followed by &quot;Weekend Recharge&quot; from 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m., followed by &quot;Pattrn&quot; from 1:00 to 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time.

The Weather Channel also broadcasts original weather-related documentary/entertainment series and specials. These programs ran throughout the rest of the schedule. During severe weather events affecting portions of the United States, the Weather Channel may preempt original programming in favor of airing extended coverage under the umbrella title &quot;Weather Center Live&quot; (which changes the color of the word &quot;LIVE&quot; from blue to red) to provide long-form coverage and analysis until its aftermath; in some events, the on-air graphics (including Lower Display Line) can go black-and-red (similar to colors that WCL uses); pre-emptions vary between local (isolated to viewers in the region affected by a particular weather event) and nationwide, depending upon the impact of the weather phenomenon/story and if a local provider utilizes a later model WeatherStar unit that allows the use of dual feeds that can substitute programming with long-form weather coverage in a given area. TWC normally utilizes a different music theme for these events, dubbed &quot;Storm Alert Mode&quot;, used for both WCL and LOT8&#x27;s.

===Movies===
In a move that caused controversy with many longtime viewers, the Weather Channel began airing weather-related movies on Friday nights on October 30, 2009. The first feature to be broadcast by the channel was the 2000 film &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot;.

After December 2009, these weekly movies were discontinued for the time being in favor of running &quot;Weather Center&quot;, which already aired throughout primetime during the rest of the work week. Despite the controversy, the Friday night film block resumed on March 26, 2010, under the title &quot;Flick and a Forecast,&quot; co-hosted by the Weather Channel meteorologist Jen Carfagno and MSNBC contributor Touré, with the documentary &quot;Into Thin Air: Deaths on Everest&quot;. During the broadcasts, the Lower Display Line that normally appears on TWC shows to provide local weather information (with breakaways during forecast and most long-form programs only for commercial breaks) was removed, appearing only a few times each hour during the film as a substitute for the standard &quot;Local on the 8s&quot; segments, with a translucent TWC logo bug appearing at other times during the film when the LDL was not on-screen.

While the films shown within the &quot;Flick and a Forecast&quot; block were weather-related in some form, some films featured (such as &quot;Misery&quot; and &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot;) had only a minimal tie to weather. On May 31, 2010, &quot;NewsBlues&quot; reported the Weather Channel&#x27;s decision to cancel the movie block, due in part to viewer criticism of movies being shown on what is intended as a news and information channel, as well as a snafu that occurred during an April 2010 tornado outbreak that led to a scheduled movie being aired instead of wall-to-wall severe weather coverage. The &quot;Flick and a Forecast&quot; presentations were then replaced by an additional hour of &quot;Weather Center&quot; and a two-hour block of long-form original programs.

==Branding==
===Logos===
The Weather Channel&#x27;s first and most recognized logo was a blue rectangular box with rounded edges that debuted with the Weather Channel&#x27;s first broadcast on May 2, 1982. This logo was revised in 1996, with the corners becoming less rounded and the logo becoming slightly flat. The &quot;weather.com&quot; URL text was permanently added underneath the logo in 1999. On August 15, 2005, the logo was overhauled again; the logo became a straight-edged square with no white trim on the edge and &quot;The Weather Channel&quot; text became oriented in title-case and left-justified, similar to its Canadian sister channel the Weather Network. A 25th-anniversary logo used in 2007 featured a white square edged in blue connected to the current logo with the text &quot;25 YEARS&quot; inside it in blue.

When NBCUniversal acquired the network in 2008, the network participated in the &quot;Green is Universal&quot; campaign, which occurs twice a year, usually during April and November. The network&#x27;s logo changes to a shade of green as part of the campaign promoting environmental conservation. Since 2014, the network has utilized a red-colored version of the logo during hurricane coverage; the red logo has also appeared during severe tornado outbreaks.

==Controversy==
===Cable and satellite carriage disputes===
====Dish Network carriage dispute====
On May 20, 2010, Dish Network announced that it was dropping the Weather Channel at 12:00 a.m. Eastern Time that day in favor of its own similar weather information channel, the Weather Cast. The carriage dispute was over the rates that the Weather Channel asked Dish Network to pay: from 11¢ per subscriber per month to 12¢, a 9% increase, totaling $140,000 per month. The dispute was also over the Weather Channel&#x27;s programming format shifting from an information-based channel to an entertainment-based service. The Weather Channel said in a statement, &quot;Dish has chosen to be the first distributor to drop the Weather Channel rather than pay the standard industry rates others in the industry have already agreed to pay&quot;, and encouraged Dish Network customers to switch to other pay television providers. Dave Shull, senior vice president for programming for Dish Network said the Weather Channel&#x27;s fees were harder for the satellite provider to justify paying as more people receive weather information through the internet and mobile services: &quot;They&#x27;re looking for bid increases when I feel like there&#x27;s a real migration to the Web, and it&#x27;s difficult to really justify those rate increases at this time.&quot;

On May 24, 2010, the Weather Channel announced that it had reached a new multi-year carriage agreement with Dish Network, the financial terms of which were not disclosed. Despite the earlier announcement that the Weather Channel would be dropped, the channel was never officially removed from Dish Network. The Weather Cast ceased operations in anticipation of the launch of a Weatherscan-based service announced as part of the agreement that would provide local weather information for Dish Network customers. The proposed movie scheduled for the Friday after the deal was struck (May 28), &quot;Gorillas in the Mist&quot;, was dropped in favor of a six-hour marathon of &quot;Tornado Road&quot;.

====DirecTV carriage dispute====
DirecTV removed the Weather Channel from its lineup on January 14, 2014, after the two parties were unable to come to terms on a new carriage agreement; as a result, DirecTV became the first major pay television provider to drop the channel in its history. Two weeks before the channel&#x27;s carriage agreement was set to expire on December 31 (after which the deadline for a new carriage deal was extended by two weeks), the satellite provider began carrying WeatherNation TV (the successor to the Weather Cast and owned by WeatherNation, LLC) on channel 361 on December 16, 2013–placing the channel next to the Weather Channel&#x27;s slot on channel 362; WeatherNation replaced the Weather Channel on channel 362–while still being carried on channel 361–when TWC was pulled.

The Weather Channel&#x27;s chief executive officer David Kenny stated that it offered DirecTV the best rate for its programming (according to SNL Kagan, the Weather Channel&#x27;s average carriage fee at the time was 13¢ per subscriber), and blasted the satellite provider&#x27;s removal of the channel by stating that it was putting profits ahead of public safety. Representatives for DirecTV stated that it added WeatherNation TV in response to subscriber complaints regarding the number of reality programs on the Weather Channel, which it estimated had amounted to 40% of its daily schedule (WeatherNation TV, which outside of its carriage by DirecTV is primarily carried on broadcast television stations as a main channel affiliation or a digital multicast service, does not run programming outside of forecasts with the only interruption in its weather coverage coming from affiliates that carry children&#x27;s programs to fulfill FCC educational programming requirements; however, WeatherNation has been criticized for its very limited amount of live programming, which TWC does provide, especially during significant weather events). DirecTV stated that weather information is also available through broadcast television stations carried as part of its local channel tier, as well as the provider&#x27;s designated emergency channels. The Weather Channel fought back by airing commercials encouraging people to not subscribe to DirecTV by parodying the provider&#x27;s popular &quot;Get Rid of Cable&quot; ad campaign.

On April 8, 2014, the Weather Channel and DirecTV both settled on a new agreement (TWC decided to alter its programming lineup by trimming the amount of reality programming on weekdays in half, restricting them to its nighttime schedule, in response to complaints from DirecTV subscribers), with the provider restoring the channel on channel 362 the following day. Access to local weather content using the red button feature did not return until May 2, 2014.

====Verizon FiOS removal and return====
Verizon FiOS dropped the Weather Channel and its sister network Weatherscan from its lineup on March 10, 2015, after the two parties were unable to come to terms on a new carriage agreement. The services have respectively been replaced by the AccuWeather Network (which launched on March 10) and a widget provided by FiOS featuring forecast content provided by WeatherBug. No public announcement was made regarding the removal until over 12 hours after TWC and Weatherscan were pulled. The Weather Channel offered a less expensive deal to Verizon FiOS, which rejected the offer. Verizon cited the Weather Channel&#x27;s frequent use of scare tactics, naming of winter storms and the wide availability of the internet and mobile apps for consumers to access weather content any time of day as the reason for dropping TWC and its services. It is unknown if Frontier FiOS customers in clusters formerly served by Verizon are affected, including (as of April 1, 2016) the recently acquired clusters from California, Texas, and Florida.

A representative for the network said in a statement, &quot;We were disappointed when, without warning late yesterday, March 9, Verizon FiOS dropped the Weather Channel from their lineup while our companies continued to be in active conversations regarding a contract renewal. FiOS customers have enjoyed a bundle of services from the Weather Channel including the network, Weatherscan, On-Demand, a Weather Widget and streaming on mobile devices. During a winter with record-breaking storms and severe weather, the Weather Channel responded with non-stop live coverage, including the ongoing presence of our crews reporting live from hard-hit communities within the Verizon FiOS footprint. This coverage resulted in the Weather Channel being the only major cable network to grow in February.&quot;

The Weather Channel had earlier signed renewal agreements with major providers that are members of the National Cable Television Cooperative, including Time Warner Cable and Cox Communications. However, representatives for the channel claimed to be shocked that &quot;Verizon FiOS would deny their subscribers access to the best live weather coverage and expertise that only the Weather Channel can provide.&quot; While Verizon claimed it was a long-term business decision (instead of a carriage dispute) that it made, the Weather Channel launched a campaign, originally urging viewers to contact FiOS about restoring the cable channel and its services. But, seeing that Verizon is not planning on bringing the channel and its services back in the near future, the Weather Channel now urges its viewers to switch providers.

After a four-year absence and with the channel under ownership of Entertainment Studios, Verizon FiOS inked a new agreement to bring the Weather Channel back to its lineups on June 24, 2019. The channel has not returned to channel lineups within Frontier FiOS&#x27;s customer footprint until 2021 with the company&#x27;s partnership with YouTube TV.

===Winter storm naming===

In the fall of 2012, the Weather Channel began to assign names to major winter storm systems. The channel stated the decision to start naming notable winter storms came as a way to more easily spread knowledge and raise awareness. By naming winter storms, TWC stated that the public would find it easier to follow storm information, social media will be able to refer to and discuss the storm, and people will have an easier time referring to the storm after it occurs. However, critics of the Weather Channel insist it is a way to further hype winter weather, especially on the heavily populated East Coast. Critics contend that (south of Boston), many other areas of the United States actually experience much more frequent and intense winter weather than the East Coast, but does not have as large of a media market.

The first winter storm to be named by TWC was a nor&#x27;easter that hit the East Coast of the United States in November 2012, which was named after the Greek goddess Athena. During the 2012–13 season, the Weather Channel named 27 winter storms (Athena, Brutus, Caesar, Draco, Euclid, Freyr, Gandolf, Helen, Iago, Jove, Khan, Luna, Magnus, Nemo, Orko, Plato, Q, Rocky, Saturn, Triton, Ukko, Virgil, Walda, Xerxes, Yogi, Zeus and Achilles). During the 2013–14 season, the Weather Channel named 26 winter storms (Atlas, Boreas, Cleon, Dion, Electra, Falco, Gemini, Hercules, Ion, Janus, Kronos, Leon, Maximus, Nika, Orion, Pax, Seneca, Titan, Ulysses, Vulcan, Wiley, Xenia, Yona, and Zephyr). Multiple factors are taken into consideration when deciding whether to name a winter storm. This includes, but is not limited to, predicted snowfall and other precipitation, wind speeds, and the timing of the storm.

The Weather Channel has provided the criteria behind their decisions to name certain storms, in particular Athena, Brutus, Gandolf, Iago, Khan, Luna, Magnus, Nemo, Saturn, and Virgil.

In response, the National Weather Service announced on November 7, 2012, that it would not recognize the Weather Channel&#x27;s names for winter storms, stating in a press release that it &quot;does not use the name of winter storms in its products.&quot; Some commentators have suggested that naming winter storms may give them undue importance in the public eye by drawing parallels to official names given by the National Weather Service to tropical storms, which are significantly more severe and devastating than winter storms. References to the names are generally limited on TWC-provided forecasts seen on NBC&#x27;s news programs.

===Keffiyeh ad removal===
On October 9, 2024, the Twitter account for the organization StopAntisemitism (@StopAntisemites) posted a picture of an advertisement for the Weather Channel featuring a woman wearing a Palestinian keffiyeh around her neck. According to Bill Ackman, the advertisement (made for the Weather Channel App) was produced by parent company The Weather Company under Francisco Partners. The @StopAntisemites account falsely stated that the keffiyeh is a hate symbol associated with violence against Jews following the October 7th attacks from a year prior, inciting pro-Israelis to demand that the Weather Channel withdraw the ad. In actuality, keffiyehs are a traditional Middle Eastern clothing for sun protection (the sudra being the Jewish analogue), with a black-and-white pattern being used to represent nationalism for the State of Palestine, a country whose sovereignty is not recognized by the Jewish ethnostate of Israel and has been devastated by the Israel-Hamas war following the October 7th attacks.

The @TheWeatherChannel account responded to @StopAntisemites, apologizing for any offense they caused, stating that they do not condone anti-Semitism in any form and that they were withdrawing the ad. The Weather Channel&#x27;s response earned backlash from pro-Palestinians, who cited the true meaning of the keffiyeh and accused the Weather Channel of caving to Islamophobic and anti-Palestinian propaganda. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) condemned The Weather Channel for agreeing with the &quot;right-wing extremist&quot; StopAntisemitism (alleging the organization and its founder of having a history of pushing new anti-Semitism, Anti-African sentiment, and self-hating Jew rhetoric) and regarding keffiyehs as a hate symbol, for which CAIR demanded an apology, stating: &quot;The Weather Channel must apologize for bowing to the racist demands of an anti-Palestinian hate group and seeming to agree with their mustache position that any expression of Palestinian heritage is by definition &#x27;antisemitic.&#x27; The keffiyeh is traditional Palestinian attire and has nothing to do with antisemitism. It is because of hate speech like this that Palestinian Americans have literally been stabbed and shot for wearing the keffiyeh over the past year. It must stop. The Weather Channel must apologize.&quot;

Covering the controversy, the conservative Jewish News Syndicate sided with StopAntisemitism&#x27;s stance, saying &quot;the distinctive black-and-white keffiyeh has long been associated with the Palestinian war of annihilation against the Jewish state.&quot;

<text>Escambia County is a county located in the south central portion of the U.S. state of Alabama. As of the 2020 census, the population was 36,757. Its county seat is Brewton.

Escambia County is coextensive with the Atmore, AL Micropolitan Statistical Area; which is itself a constituent part of the larger Pensacola-Ferry Pass, FL-AL Combined Statistical Area.
The county is the base of the state&#x27;s only federally recognized Native American tribe, the Poarch Band of Creek Indians. They have developed gaming casinos and a hotel on their reservation here, but also a much larger business extending to locations in other states and the Caribbean.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Escambia&quot; may have been derived from the Creek name &quot;Shambia&quot;, meaning &quot;clearwater&quot;, or the Choctaw word for &quot;cane-brake&quot; or &quot;reed-brake&quot;.

==History==

Historic American Indian tribes in the area included the Muskogean-speaking Creek, Choctaw, and Alabama, who had inhabited the lands for centuries and had many settlements. The former two tribes were among those in the Southeast whom the European-American settlers called the Five Civilized Tribes, as they adopted some European-American cultural ways. Many of their members had close working relationships with traders and settlers moving into the area in the early 19th century. Most of these nations were forced to cede their lands to the United States and to remove in the 1830s to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River.

Escambia County was organized and established after the American Civil War, on December 10, 1868, during the Reconstruction era. The state legislature created it from parts of Baldwin and Conecuh counties, to the west and north, respectively. The area was part of the coastal plain. It was largely agricultural into the 20th century.

The county is subject to heavy winds and rains due to seasonal hurricanes. In September 1979, the county was declared a disaster area due to damage from Hurricane Frederic. It was declared a disaster area again in September 2004 due to damage from Hurricane Ivan.

In the 20th century, the Poarch Band of Creek Indians organized to gain recognition as a tribe, and established a government under a written constitution. It had control of some lands that were taken into trust on their behalf by the federal government as part of the federal recognition process. It is the only federally recognized tribe in the state. Since the late 20th century, they have developed three gaming resorts to generate revenues for tribal health and welfare.

In addition, Alabama has recognized nine tribes, generally descendants of Choctaw, Creek, and Cherokee Native Americans who had historically lived here.

==Government==
Like most rural counties in Alabama, Franklin County has gone solidly Republican in the 21st century, but it has flirted with the party at a federal level since the 1950s. In a pattern typical of most rural Alabama counties, Franklin County supported the Dixiecrats in 1948 and George Wallace in 1968, but unlike other counties, had been won by Republicans in 1956 and 1960, cracking the wall of the Solid South before full-fledged turnover in 1964 and beyond.

As is the case with most rural counties nationwide that supported Bill Clinton in the 1996 election, the county has since turned sharply against the Democratic Party. In 2020, Donald Trump won it over Joe Biden by 83–17 percent, continuing a backsliding trend for Democrats in the rural South.

<text>Gaspard Monge, Comte de [[Pelusium|Péluse]] (; 9 May 1746 – 28 July 1818) was a French mathematician, commonly presented as the inventor of descriptive geometry, (the mathematical basis of) technical drawing, and the father of differential geometry. During the French Revolution he served as the Minister of the Marine, and was involved in the reform of the French educational system, helping to found the École Polytechnique.

== Biography ==

===Early life===
Monge was born at Beaune, Côte-d&#x27;Or, the son of a merchant. He was educated at the college of the Oratorians at Beaune. In 1762 he went to the Collège de la Trinité at Lyon, where, one year after he had begun studying, he was made a teacher of physics at the age of just seventeen.

After finishing his education in 1764 he returned to Beaune, where he made a large-scale plan of the town, inventing the methods of observation and constructing the necessary instruments; the plan was presented to the town, and is still preserved in their library. An officer of engineers who saw it wrote to the commandant of the École Royale du Génie at Mézières, recommending Monge to him and he was given a job as a draftsman. L. T. C. Rolt, an engineer and historian of technology, credited Monge with the birth of engineering drawing. When in the Royal School, he became a member of Freemasonry, initiated into ″L’Union parfaite″ lodge.

===Career===
Those studying at the officer school were exclusively drawn from the aristocracy, so he was not allowed admission to the institution itself. His manual skill was highly regarded, but his mathematical skills were not made use of. Nevertheless, he worked on the development of his ideas in his spare time. At this time he came to contact with Charles Bossut, the professor of mathematics at the École Royale du Génie. &quot;I was a thousand times tempted,&quot; he said long afterwards, &quot;to tear up my drawings in disgust at the esteem in which they were held, as if I had been good for nothing better.&quot;

After a year at the École Royale, Monge was asked to produce a plan for a fortification in such a way as to optimise its defensive arrangement. There was an established method for doing this which involved lengthy calculations but Monge devised a way of solving the problems by using drawings. At first his solution was not accepted, since it had not taken the time judged to be necessary, but upon examination the value of the work was recognised, and Monge&#x27;s exceptional abilities were recognised.

After Bossut left the École Royale du Génie, Monge took his place in January 1769, and in 1770 he was also appointed instructor in experimental physics.

In 1777, Monge married Cathérine Huart, who owned a forge. This led Monge to develop an interest in metallurgy. In 1780 he became a member of the French Academy of Sciences; his friendship with chemist C. L. Berthollet began at this time. In 1783, after leaving Mézières, he was, on the death of É. Bézout, appointed examiner of naval candidates. Although pressed by the minister to prepare a complete course of mathematics, he declined to do so on the grounds that this would deprive Mme Bézout of her only income, that from the sale of the textbooks written by her late husband. In 1786 he wrote and published his &quot;Traité élémentaire de la statique&quot;.

===1789 and after===

The French Revolution completely changed the course of Monge&#x27;s career. He was a strong supporter of the Revolution, and in 1792, on the creation by the Legislative Assembly of an executive council, Monge accepted the office of Minister of the Marine, and held this office from 10 August 1792 to 10 April 1793, when he resigned. When the Committee of Public Safety made an appeal to the academics to assist in the defence of the republic, he applied himself wholly to these operations, and distinguished himself by his energy, writing the &quot;Description Le l&#x27;art de Fabriquer Les canons&quot; and &quot;Avis aux ouvriers en fer sur la fabrication de l&#x27;acier&quot;.

He took a very active part in the measures for the establishment of the Ecole Normale (which existed only during the first four months of the year 1795), and of the school for public works, afterwards the École Polytechnique, and was at each of them professor for descriptive geometry. &quot;Géométrie descriptive. Leçons données aux écoles normales&quot; was published in 1799 from transcriptions of his lectures given in 1795. He later published &quot;Application de l&#x27;analyse à la géométrie&quot;, which enlarged on the Lectures.

From May 1796 to October 1797 Monge was in Italy with C.L. Berthollet and some artists to select the paintings and sculptures being levied from the Italians. While there he became friendly with Napoleon Bonaparte. Upon his return to France, he was appointed as the Director of the École Polytechnique, but early in 1798 he was sent to Italy on a mission that ended in the establishment of the short-lived Roman Republic.

From there Monge joined Napoleon&#x27;s expedition to Egypt, taking part with Berthollet in the scientific work of the Institut d&#x27;Égypte and the Egyptian Institute of Sciences and Arts. They accompanied Bonaparte to Syria, and returned with him in 1798 to France. Monge was appointed president of the Egyptian commission, and he resumed his connection with the École Polytechnique. His later mathematical papers are published (1794–1816) in the Journal and the Correspondence of the École Polytechnique. On the formation of the Sénat conservateur he was appointed a member of that body, with an ample provision and the title of count of Pelusium (Comte de Péluse), and he became the Senate conservateur&#x27;s president during 1806–7. Then on the fall of Napoleon he had all of his honours taken away, and he was even excluded from the list of members of the reconstituted Institute.

Napoleon Bonaparte stated Monge was an atheist. His remains were first interred in a mausoleum in Le Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris and later transferred to the Panthéon in Paris.

A statue portraying him was erected in Beaune in 1849. Monge&#x27;s name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the base of the Eiffel Tower.

Since 4 November 1992 the &quot;Marine Nationale&quot; operate the MRIS &quot;Monge&quot;, named after him.

== Work==
Between 1770 and 1790 Monge contributed various papers on mathematics and physics to the &quot;Memoirs of the Academy of Turin&quot;, the &quot;Mémoires des savantes étrangers&quot; of the Academy of Paris, the &quot;Mémoires&quot; of the same Academy, and the &quot;Annales de chimie&quot;, including &quot;Sur la théorie des déblais et des remblais&quot; [&quot;On the theory of cut and fill&quot;] (&quot;Mém. de l’acad. de Paris&quot;, 1781), which is an elegant investigation of the problem with earthworks referred to in the title and establishes in connection with it his capital discovery of the curves of curvature of a surface. It is also noteworthy to mention that in his &quot;Mémoire sur quelques phénomènes de la vision&quot; Monge proposed an early implicit explanation of the color constancy phenomenon based on several known observations.

Leonhard Euler, in his 1760 paper on curvature in the &quot;Berlin Memoirs&quot;, had considered, not the normals of the surface, but the normals of the plane sections through a particular normal, so that the question of the intersection of successive normals of the surface had never presented itself to him. Monge&#x27;s paper gives the ordinary differential equation of the curves of curvature, and establishes the general theory in a very satisfactory manner; the application to the interesting particular case of the ellipsoid was first made by him in a later paper in 1795.

Monge&#x27;s 1781 memoir is also the earliest known anticipation of linear optimization problems, in particular of the transportation problem. Related to that, the Monge soil-transport problem leads to a weak-topology definition of a distance between distributions rediscovered many times since by such as L. V. Kantorovich, Paul Lévy, Leonid Vaseršteĭn, and others; and bearing their names in various combinations in various contexts.

Another of his papers in the volume for 1783 relates to the production of water by the combustion of hydrogen. Monge&#x27;s results had been anticipated by Henry Cavendish. It was also in this time, from 1783 - 1784, that Monge worked with (Jean-François, Jean-Baptiste-Paul-Antoine, or Abbé Pierre-Romain) Clouet to liquefy sulfur dioxide by passing a stream of the gas through a U-tube sunken in a refrigerant mixture of ice and salt. This made them the first to liquefy a pure gas.

Much like the state and the rest of the Deep South, Geneva County was locked for the Democrats before 1964, until Herbert Hoover won against Democrat nominee Al Smith in 1928 by 48 votes. However, ever since 1980, Geneva County has been a Republican stronghold. The last Democrat to carry the county was Deep South native Jimmy Carter in 1976. 

Geneva is also noteworthy for being the best county in the country for Alabama native George Wallace in the 1968 election, where his main support was from the Deep South and was strongest in the Wiregrass and Piney Woods regions.













==Education==
There are two school districts including parts of the county: Geneva City School District and Geneva County School District.

<doc id="77842" wikidata="Q493709" url="?curid=77842" title="Greene County, Alabama">
<text>Greene County is a county located in the west central portion of the U.S. state of Alabama. As of the 2020 census, the population was 7,730, the least populous county in Alabama. Its county seat is Eutaw. It was named in honor of Revolutionary War General Nathanael Greene of Rhode Island.

As of the 2020 census, the county&#x27;s population was 81% African American, making it the fourth-most heavily black county by proportion in the United States, and the most black county among all counties located outside of the state of Mississippi. It is documented as one of the unhealthiest counties in the United States, with a population with an obesity percentage of 46.3 percent, the highest of any county in the state, and second to only Claiborne County in the western portion of neighboring Mississippi. The life expectancy there is 74.9 years, over 2 years lower than the national average.

==History==
Greene County was established on December 13, 1819. Eutaw was established as the county seat in 1838, when the seat was moved from Erie. Eutaw is more centrally located.

Being designated as the seat of government stimulated growth in Eutaw.

===Reconstruction era (1865–1876)===
In 1867 the Reconstruction legislature organized Hale County, taking much of it from the eastern part of Greene County, plus sections of other neighboring counties. This was a period of continuing insurgency by whites, who attempted to maintain dominance over blacks. The latter comprised a majority in Greene County and others in the Black Belt.

The Greene County Courthouse in Eutaw was burned by arson in 1868, in a year with considerable election-associated violence throughout the South. On March 31, 1870, there were at least two insurgent attacks in Greene County. James Martin, a prominent black Republican, was shot and wounded by unidentified gunmen near his home in Union, Alabama. When a physician tried to remove the bullet to help him, the gunmen interrupted and took Martin away. He was &quot;disappeared&quot;, believed dead.

That same night, Republican County Solicitor, Alexander Boyd, a white native of South Carolina and Alabama resident, was murdered by the Ku Klux Klan in his hotel in Eutaw. The prevailing theory by historians for the burning of the courthouse is that the records of some 1,800 suits by freedmen against planters were about to be prosecuted; the fire destroyed the documents. The deaths of Martin and Boyd were typical of the KKK, who attacked Republican officeholders and freedmen sympathizers, in addition to freedmen, especially politicians.

Although Governor William Hugh Smith sent a special agent, John Minnis, to explore these deaths, he said he was unable to identify Boyd&#x27;s killers. (Minnis later served as US Attorney and prosecuted Klansmen under the Enforcement Acts.) He suggested that the killers had come from Mississippi. A grand jury was called on Boyd&#x27;s death, but no one was prosecuted. No grand jury was called for Martin&#x27;s disappearance and presumed death.

In the fall of 1870, two more black Republicans were killed in violence before the election. At a Republican rally on October 25, 1870, attracting 2,000 blacks in Eutaw, white Klansmen attacked the crowd in the courthouse square, leaving at least four blacks dead and 54 wounded. After this, most blacks stayed away from the polls or voted Democratic out of fear of reprisals; the Democratic gubernatorial candidate carried Greene County.

===Civil Rights Era (1964–1970)===
On July 30, 1969, Greene County made history when it became &quot;the first in the South since reconstruction with both the commission and the school board dominated by Negroes.&quot; Barred from the ballot in the November 1968 general election, the new &quot;National Democratic Party of Alabama&quot; filed suit in federal court and a special election was ordered. In the new vote, African-American candidates won four of the five seats on the Greene County Commission, and two additional seats on the five-member Greene County School Board, and the &quot;Montgomery Advertiser&quot; would note the next day that &quot;the election gave blacks control of both major governing bodies— a first in Alabama.&quot; The date of the vote would later be described as &quot;a watershed for black political empowerment in Alabama,&quot;, leading to African-American candidates finally winning the right to govern counties where white residents were the minority.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.9%) is water.
Over 90% of Greene County&#x27;s boundaries are dictated by the Tombigbee, Black Warrior, and Sipsey Rivers and much of the county is dominated by the valleys of the three rivers.

==Demographics== 
In 1867, a chunk of the county and associated population was taken to form Hale County. This resulted in an apparent 40% loss in population between 1860 and 1870. In the 20th century, there were population losses after agricultural decline and the migration of rural workers to cities in other areas.

==Government==
Greene County is strongly Democratic, but the nature of the membership has changed since the late 20th century. After the Civil War, conservative whites of the South continued in the Democratic Party. After being emancipated and gaining the franchise, African Americans generally joined the Republican Party of President Abraham Lincoln. After African Americans were disfranchised in Alabama in 1901 and other former Confederate states, the Democratic Party was even more exclusively white in Greene County and throughout the South. In the late 20th century, after civil rights legislation enabled African Americans to vote again, they joined the national Democratic Party.

The last Republican to win the county in a presidential election was Barry Goldwater in the 1964. It was only one of nine counties to back Goldwater and McGovern, all of which are located in the Deep South.

<doc id="77854" wikidata="Q230580" url="?curid=77854" title="Infanta Cristina of Spain">
<text>Infanta Cristina (Cristina Federica Victoria Antonia de la Santísima Trinidad de Borbón y de Grecia, born 13 June 1965) is the younger daughter of King Juan Carlos I and his wife, Queen Sofía. She is sixth in the line of succession to the Spanish throne, after her brother King Felipe VI&#x27;s children, her sister Infanta Elena, Duchess of Lugo, and Elena&#x27;s children Felipe and Victoria.

On 26 September 1997, on the occasion of her marriage to handball player Iñaki Urdangarin, she was created Duchess of Palma de Mallorca, by her father, King Juan Carlos. From 2013 to 2017, she was investigated for possible corruption involving a company she owned along with her husband. In 2015, her brother stripped her of her royal dukedom. In 2017 she was acquitted of all charges.

Cristina represented the Crown during the reign of her father. Since October 2011, she has remained apart from the royal family and any official act of the Crown and, since 2014, she is no longer a member of the royal family.

==Early life==

Cristina de Borbón was born on 13 June 1965 at Our Lady of Loreto Sanatorium, now known as ORPEA Madrid Loreto in Madrid and was baptized into the Church at the Palacio de La Zarzuela by the Archbishop of Madrid. Her godparents were Alfonso, Duke of Anjou and Cádiz (her first cousin once removed), and Infanta Maria Cristina (great-aunt).

She is a sailor, and competed in the Tornado event at the 1988 Summer Olympics.

She received her secondary education at Santa María del Camino School before graduating from the Universidad Complutense de Madrid in 1989 with a degree in political science. She pursued postgraduate studies at New York University, obtaining an MA in international relations in 1990. In 1991, she gained practical experience working at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris. In 2001, she was named United Nations goodwill ambassador United Nations Goodwill Ambassador for the 2nd World Assembly on Aging.

She speaks Spanish, Catalan, English, French, and Greek.

==Marriage and children==
Cristina married team handball player Iñaki Urdangarin at Barcelona Cathedral on 4 October 1997. On this occasion, she was created Duchess of Palma de Mallorca for life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Real Decreto 1502/1997&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The couple has four children, all born at Teknon Medical Centre in Barcelona: 
* Juan Valentín Urdangarin y Borbón, Grandee of Spain (born 29 September 1999), 
* Pablo Nicolás Sebastián Urdangarin y de Borbón, Grandee of Spain (born 6 December 2000),
* Miguel Urdangarin y Borbón, Grandee of Spain (born 30 April 2002),
* Irene Urdangarin y Borbón, Grandee of Spain (born 5 June 2005).

They lived in Washington, D.C., from 2009 to 2012, where her husband worked for Telefónica. In August 2013, she moved with her four children to Geneva, Switzerland, to take a job with the Caixa Foundation, while her husband, who was the subject of an embezzlement investigation, remained in Barcelona.

On 24 January 2022, Cristina and Urdangarin announced their separation. The couple divorced in December 2023.

== Activities and personal work ==
Cristina started to attend official events at a very young age. One of the first official events she attended was the proclamation of her father in November 1975. Since finishing her most basic education in 1983, Cristina, along with her sister Elena, supported their parents representing the Crown at official events such as the National Day, the wedding of Princess Astrid of Belgium, the re-burial of Queen Victoria Eugenia at El Escorial, and the state visit of Mexican president Miguel de la Madrid to Spain, among others.

After the corruption scandal of her husband, the Duchess and her husband distanced themselves from the royal family, being their last official event as members of the royal family on 12 October 2011. After the ascension of her brother in June 2014, she formally left the royal family.

Regarding her personal work, Cristina has been working for La Caixa Foundation since October 1993. At the same time, she works for the Aga Khan Foundation. She visits Barcelona often for work, but she has lived in Geneva, Switzerland since 2013.

Since 2024, although she has maintained her residence in Geneva, she spends long periods at the Royal Palace of Zarzuela, where her younger children live with their grandmother.

==Corruption inquiry==
Her husband was investigated from early 2012 on suspicion of fraudulently obtaining millions in public funds in the Nóos case. In April 2013, Infanta Cristina was formally named as a suspect in the case by the judge in charge. When invited to comment, a Royal Household spokesman said that the &quot;Casa Real&quot; &quot;does not comment on judicial decisions&quot;, yet the next day, after the anti-corruption prosecutor announced that he would appeal the decision, it relented by expressing &quot;absolute conformity&quot; with the legal authorities. In light of the forthcoming trial, she and her children moved to Geneva, Switzerland, in summer 2013. On 7 January 2014, a Spanish judge charged her with tax fraud and money laundering and ordered her to appear in court. The infanta made her first appearance in the Majorca Court on 8 February 2014, where she denied any knowledge of her husband&#x27;s dealings.

Spanish judge Jose Castro formalised charges against Infanta Cristina on 25 June 2014. In November 2014 the High Court of Palma de Mallorca upheld tax fraud charges against the princess, paving the way for her to face trial; however, it decided to drop money-laundering charges. Her lawyers maintained that they remained completely convinced of her innocence. On 22 December 2014 the High Court of the Balearic Islands announced that Infanta Cristina, her husband, and 15 others would stand trial on tax fraud charges &quot;as soon as next year&quot;.

On 12 June 2015, King Felipe VI officially deprived his sister of her dukedom, privately announcing his intention beforehand. After this decision was made public, Cristina&#x27;s lawyer, Miquel Roca, declared that the king&#x27;s decision followed a formal request from the infanta, although the Royal Household denied it, saying that her renunciation to the title was after the king&#x27;s private phone call to communicate her the decision. Her right of succession to the throne, and to the royal title of &quot;infanta&quot; were unaffected.

Cristina&#x27;s trial began on 11 January 2016, presided over by three judges in Palma de Mallorca. The charges were filed by the &#x27;Clean Hands&#x27; anti-graft organisation using a Spanish legal instrument known as the &#x27;people&#x27;s accusation&#x27;. At that time, her lawyers had asked judges to drop the criminal charges against her, and the state prosecutor said there was insufficient evidence to back up the accusations, but on 29 January the Court in Palma de Mallorca, where the trial was being held, said in a statement it was upholding the charges. She took the stand in March 2016, denying being an accessory to tax evasion, and denying knowledge of her husband&#x27;s activities. She insisted on her right to answer only questions from her own lawyer. She said that her husband handled the couple&#x27;s finances, and that she did not know why some large personal expenses were charged to a credit card of a company that the couple owned. She said that she never spoke with her husband about these matters because she was not interested in the subject, and that she was very busy with her small children.

On 17 February 2017, she was acquitted of the charges, while her husband received a sentence of imprisonment for a term of six years and three months.

<text>Hale County is a county located in the west central portion of the U.S. state of Alabama. As of the 2020 census, the population was 14,785. Its county seat is Greensboro. It is named in honor of Confederate officer Stephen Fowler Hale.

Hale County is part of the Tuscaloosa, AL Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

Hale County was established following the end of the American Civil War, on January 30, 1867. Located in the west-central section of the state, it was created from portions of Greene, Marengo, Perry, and Tuscaloosa counties. The vast majority of the territory came from Greene County. The first American settlers in this area had been southerners migrating from Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, and the Carolinas.

Hale County is connected to three major twentieth-century artists: Walker Evans photographed the area in 1936 while he collaborated with James Agee on the 1941 book &quot;Let Us Now Praise Famous Men&quot;. Starting in the 1960s, artist William Christenberry, born in Tuscaloosa, photographed various structures in Hale County as part of his multi-media artistic investigations. More recently, Hale County has become the home of the nationally recognized Auburn University Rural Studio, an architectural outreach program founded by architect and artist Samuel Mockbee and D. K. Ruth. It is also the birthplace of Eugene Sawyer, the second African American mayor of Chicago. In 2019 the film &quot;Hale County This Morning, This Evening&quot; by artist RaMell Ross was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, poetically addressing the region&#x27;s shift in demographics and the power of intra-community authorship.

Since the American Civil War, whites have controlled much of the economic and political power in Hale County, enforced early by violence and later by the decades of disenfranchisement of black voters and statewide imposition of Jim Crow. In the first half of the 20th century, many African Americans left the county in two waves of migration to cities and northern and western industrial centers. Beginning in the late 1960s, they recovered the ability to vote.

In 1997, after a highly contested mayoral election, the city of Greensboro elected its first black mayor, John E. Owens Jr. Claude Hamilton, the first African-American chief of police, was appointed in 2000. In 2006, black and white county residents joined in electing the first black county sheriff, Kenneth W. Ellis, who was formerly the Moundville police chief.

Hale County has suffered economic decline, particularly in the southern more rural end of the county. Many manufacturing plants closed during late 20th century restructuring, and population and businesses declined with the loss of jobs, especially in and around Greensboro (the county seat). The northern portion of the county, however, has enjoyed population and industrial growth due to its proximity to Tuscaloosa County. The latter has been a growing center of industry and new businesses, anchored by the University of Alabama and its large student body and resources.

<text>Mary Poppins is a 1964 American live-action/animated hybrid musical fantasy comedy film directed by Robert Stevenson and produced by Walt Disney, with songs written and composed by the Sherman Brothers. The screenplay is by Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi, based on P. L. Travers&#x27;s book series &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;. The film, which combines live-action and animation, stars Julie Andrews in her feature film debut as Mary Poppins, who visits a dysfunctional family in London and employs her unique brand of lifestyle to improve the family&#x27;s dynamic. Dick Van Dyke, David Tomlinson, and Glynis Johns are featured in supporting roles. The film was shot entirely at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California, using painted London background scenes.

&quot;Mary Poppins&quot; was released on August 27, 1964, to critical acclaim and commercial success, earning $44 million in theatrical rentals in its original run. It became the highest-grossing film of 1964 in the United States, and at the time of its release became Disney&#x27;s highest-grossing film. During its theatrical lifetime, it grossed over $103 million worldwide. It received a total of thirteen Academy Award nominations—a record for any film released by Walt Disney Studios—including Best Picture, and won five: Best Actress for Andrews, Best Film Editing, Best Original Music Score, Best Visual Effects, and Best Original Song for &quot;Chim Chim Cher-ee&quot;. It is considered Walt Disney&#x27;s crowning live-action achievement and is the only one of his films to earn a Best Picture nomination during his lifetime. In 2013, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

A biographical drama based on the making of the film, &quot;Saving Mr. Banks&quot;, was released on October 20, 2013. A sequel, &quot;Mary Poppins Returns&quot;, was released on December 19, 2018.

== Plot ==

In 1910, Winifred Banks returns to her home in Edwardian London after a suffragette rally (&quot;Sister Suffragette&quot;) and learns that her children, Jane and Michael, have run away, &quot;for the fourth time this week&quot;, which prompted their nanny, Katie Nanna, to quit her job. That night, Winifred&#x27;s strict and ambitious husband George returns home from his job at the bank (&quot;The Life I Lead&quot;) and places a newspaper advertisement for a stern, no-nonsense nanny. Jane and Michael present their own advertisement for a kind, sympathetic nanny (&quot;The Perfect Nanny&quot;), but George rips up their letter and throws the scraps in the fireplace. A strong wind draws the scraps up through the chimney and into the sky.

The next day, several sour-faced nannies await outside the Banks family&#x27;s home, but a strong gust of wind magically blows them away. Jane and Michael then witness a young woman floating down from the sky, gracefully descending with an open umbrella. The woman enters the Banks family&#x27;s home and introduces herself as Mary Poppins. To George&#x27;s shock, Mary is holding the children&#x27;s advertisement, and the scraps have been put back together. She agrees with the advertisement&#x27;s requests but promises George that she will be firm with his children. Mary manipulates George into hiring her. Upstairs, Mary helps the children magically clean their nursery (&quot;A Spoonful of Sugar&quot;).

While walking in a park, the trio encounters Mary&#x27;s friend Bert, a jack of all trades working as a street painter. Mary transports the group into one of Bert&#x27;s drawings. While the children ride on a carousel, Mary and Bert sing while strolling (&quot;Jolly Holiday&quot;). Bert and Mary then participate in a horse race, which Mary wins. Mary uses a nonsense word to describe her victory (&quot;Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious&quot;). When a thunderstorm dissolves Bert&#x27;s drawings, the group is returned to London. While putting the children to bed, Mary sings a lullaby (&quot;Stay Awake&quot;).

The next day, the trio and Bert visit Mary&#x27;s odd uncle, Albert, whose uncontrollable laughter has caused him to float (&quot;I Love to Laugh&quot;). George becomes annoyed by the household&#x27;s cheery atmosphere and threatens to fire Mary. She persuades him to take the children to his workplace. That evening, Mary sings a lullaby about a woman who sells bird food on the steps of St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral (&quot;Feed the Birds&quot;). The next day at the bank, the children meet George&#x27;s boss, the elderly Mr. Dawes Sr., who advises Michael to invest his tuppence in the bank, ultimately snatching the coins out of Michael&#x27;s hand (&quot;Fidelity Fiduciary Bank&quot;). Michael demands them back; other customers overhear the conflict, and they all begin demanding their own money back, causing a bank run.

Jane and Michael flee the bank and get lost in the East End. Bert, now working as a chimney sweep, escorts them home (&quot;Chim Chim Cher-ee&quot;). The three and Mary venture onto the rooftops, where Bert dances with other chimney sweeps (&quot;Step in Time&quot;). George later receives a phone call from the bank, requesting a meeting with him regarding Michael&#x27;s actions. The children overhear the phone call and become concerned. Bert advises George to spend more time with Jane and Michael before they grow up (&quot;A Man Has Dreams&quot;). Hoping to make amends, Michael gives George the tuppence. Stricken with regret, George slowly walks through London to the bank, where he is given a humiliating cashiering. Lost for words, George exclaims &quot;Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious&quot;, tells a joke Uncle Albert had told the children, and happily walks home. When Mr. Dawes Sr. understands the joke, he floats up into the air, laughing.

The next day, Mary Poppins tells the children she must leave. George mends his children&#x27;s kite and takes the family out to fly it. At the park, the family encounters Mr. Dawes Sr.&#x27;s son, Mr. Dawes Jr., who reveals that his father died laughing at the joke (&quot;Let&#x27;s Go Fly a Kite&quot;). Mr. Dawes Jr. says his father had never been happier and gratefully rehires (and promotes) George. Mary watches the family and decides her work is done. As Mary flies away, Bert looks up and says, &quot;Goodbye, Mary Poppins. Don&#x27;t stay away too long.&quot;

==Cast==
===Live-action cast===

* Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins, a magical and loving woman who descends from the clouds in response to the Banks children&#x27;s advertisement for a nanny. She is firm in her use of authority but gentle and kind as well, a major departure from the original books, in which the character was more stern and pompous.
* Dick Van Dyke as Bert, a cockney jack-of-all-trades and Mary Poppins&#x27; closest friend, who is completely accustomed to her magic. Their playful interactions imply that they have known each other for a long time and that this kind of story has repeated itself many times. Bert has at least four jobs throughout the film: a one-man band, a sidewalk chalk artist, a chimney sweep, and a kite seller.
** Van Dyke also portrays Mr. Dawes Sr., the old director of the bank where Mr. Banks works. During the film&#x27;s end titles, &quot;Navckid Keyd&quot;, an anagram of Dick Van Dyke, is first credited as playing the role before the letters unscramble to reveal Van Dyke&#x27;s name.
* David Tomlinson as George Banks, Mary Poppins&#x27; employer and strict, driven, and disciplined father of Jane and Michael. He works at the Dawes Tomes Mousley Grubbs Fidelity Fiduciary Bank in London.
* Glynis Johns as Winifred Banks, the easily distracted wife of George Banks and the mother of Jane and Michael. She is depicted as a member of Emmeline Pankhurst&#x27;s &quot;Votes for Women&quot; suffrage movement. Mrs. Banks was originally named Cynthia, but this was changed to the more English-sounding Winifred per Travers.
* Hermione Baddeley as Ellen, the maid of the Banks residence
* Reta Shaw as Mrs. Clara Brill, the cook of the Banks residence
* Karen Dotrice as Jane Banks, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Banks and Michael&#x27;s older sister. Jane is a high-spirited, bright, and precocious young girl.
* Matthew Garber as Michael Banks, the son of Mr. and Mrs. Banks and Jane&#x27;s younger brother. Michael is an excitable and naughty young boy who simply adores and looks up to his father. Both Jane and Michael are mischievous and misbehave in an attempt to seek attention from their parents.
* Elsa Lanchester as Katie Nanna, the disgruntled nanny who quits the Banks family
* Arthur Treacher as Constable Cody Jones, a police officer
* Reginald Owen as Admiral Boom, the Banks&#x27; eccentric neighbor and a naval officer. He has his first mate, Mr. Binnacle, fire a cannon from his roof every 8 a.m. and 6 p.m.
* Ed Wynn as Uncle Albert, a jolly gentleman who suffers from an unknown condition where he floats in the air due to his uncontrollable laughter. Although he likes having company over, he becomes sad and cries when his guests have to leave and he falls back to the ground, since it is the inversion of laughing.
* Jane Darwell as the &quot;Bird Woman&quot;, an old woman who sells breadcrumbs for the pigeons on the steps of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral

== Production ==
=== Development ===

The film&#x27;s main basis was the first novel in the &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; series. According to the 40th Anniversary DVD release of the film in 2004, Disney&#x27;s daughters fell in love with the &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; books and made Disney promise to make a film based on them. He first attempted to purchase the film rights from P. L. Travers as early as 1938, but Travers repeatedly refused; she did not believe a film version would do justice to her books.

Disney was also then known primarily as a producer of animated films, and had yet to produce a major live-action work. For more than 20 years, he made periodic efforts to convince Travers to release the rights, including visiting her home in Chelsea, London. He finally succeeded in 1961, although Travers demanded and obtained script-approval rights. The Sherman Brothers composed the music score and were involved in the film&#x27;s development, suggesting the setting be changed from the 1930s to the Edwardian era. Pre-production and music creation took about two years.

=== Pre-production ===
Travers was an adviser to the production, and was billed as the film&#x27;s consultant. However, she disapproved of the dilution of the harsher aspects of Mary Poppins&#x27; character, felt ambivalent about the music, and hated the use of animation so much that she ruled out any further adaptations of the later &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; novels. She objected to a number of elements that made it into the film. Rather than original songs, she wanted the soundtrack to feature known standards of the Edwardian period in which the story is set. However, due to contract stipulations citing that he had final cut privilege on the finished print, Disney overruled her. In a 2013 interview, Dick van Dyke said that Travers felt that neither he nor Julie Andrews were right for the lead roles.

Much of the Travers–Disney correspondence is part of the Travers collection of papers in the State Library of New South Wales, Australia. The relationship between Travers and Disney is detailed in &quot;Mary Poppins She Wrote&quot;, a biography of Travers by Valerie Lawson. The biography is the basis for two documentaries on Travers: &quot;The Real Mary Poppins&quot; and Lisa Matthews&#x27; &quot;The Shadow of Mary Poppins&quot;. Their relationship during the development of the film was also dramatized in the 2013 Disney film &quot;Saving Mr. Banks&quot;.

=== Casting ===
In March 1961, Disney announced that it might cast Hayley Mills and Mary Martin in the film.

Julie Harris, Angela Lansbury, and Bette Davis were considered for the role of Mary and Cary Grant was Walt&#x27;s favorite choice for the role of Bert; Laurence Harvey and Anthony Newley were also considered for Bert.

Julie Andrews, who was making her feature film acting debut after a successful stage career, was given the prime role of Mary Poppins soon after she was passed over by Jack L. Warner and replaced with Audrey Hepburn for the role of Eliza Doolittle in his screen adaptation of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, even though Andrews originated the role on Broadway. When Disney approached Andrews about playing Poppins, she was three months pregnant. Disney assured her that they were willing to postpone filming until she had given birth so that she could take the part. Disney considered actor Stanley Holloway for the role of Admiral Boom, but it went to Reginald Owen, due to Holloway&#x27;s commitment to &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;.

Andrews also provided the voice in two other sections of the film: During &quot;A Spoonful of Sugar&quot;, she provided the whistling harmony for the robin, and she was also one of the Pearly singers during &quot;Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious&quot;. David Tomlinson, besides playing Mr. Banks, provided the voices of Mary&#x27;s talking umbrella, Admiral Boom&#x27;s first mate, and numerous other voice-over parts. During the &quot;Jolly Holiday&quot; sequence, the three singing Cockney geese were all voiced by Marni Nixon, who regularly sang for actresses with substandard singing voices. (Nixon later provided the singing voice for Hepburn in &quot;My Fair Lady,&quot; and played one of Andrews&#x27; fellow nuns in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;.) Andrews later beat Hepburn for the Best Actress Award at the Golden Globes for their respective roles. Andrews also won the Oscar for Best Actress for her role (Hepburn was not nominated for it). Richard Sherman, one of the songwriters, also voiced a penguin, and one of the Pearlies. Robert Sherman provided the speaking voice of Jane Darwell because Darwell&#x27;s voice was too soft to be heard in the soundtrack. He is heard saying the only line: &quot;Feed the birds, tuppence a bag.&quot;

Disney cast Dick Van Dyke in the main supporting role of Bert after seeing his work on &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;. After winning the role, Van Dyke lobbied to also play the senior Mr. Dawes. Disney felt he was too young for the part, but Van Dyke won him over after a screen test. Van Dyke had trouble with Bert&#x27;s Cockney accent. English character actor J. Pat O&#x27;Malley provided some coaching; but although Van Dyke is fondly remembered for the film, his attempt at a Cockney accent is considered one of the poorer accents in film history. (It was #2 in a 2003 poll by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine of the worst film accents.) Van Dyke claimed that O&#x27;Malley &quot;didn&#x27;t do an accent any better than I did&quot;. In 2017, Van Dyke received an award for television excellence from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), at which time he said, &quot;I appreciate this opportunity to apologise to the members of BAFTA for inflicting on them the most atrocious cockney accent in the history of cinema.&quot; A chief executive of BAFTA responded, &quot;We look forward to his acceptance speech in whatever accent he chooses on the night. We have no doubt it will be &#x27;supercalifragilisticexpialidocious&#x27;.&quot;

=== Filming ===
Filming took place between May and September 1963 in Burbank, California; post-production and animation took another eleven months.
The scene in which Mary Poppins and Bert interact with a group of animated penguins is noted for its use of the sodium vapor process. Rather than using the more common bluescreen process to insert the actors into the animated footage, the actors were filmed against a white screen lit with sodium vapor lights, which have a yellow hue. A special camera was fitted with a prism that filtered this light to a separate reel of film, creating a highly accurate matte that could be used to isolate the actors from the background. This created a crisp, clean image and even allowed the partially transparent veil of Mary Poppins&#x27;s costume to let through light from the background. The film received the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects in 1965 for this effect.

Peter Menefee, one of the 12 dancing chimney sweeps supporting Bert, provided some insight into the film&#x27;s choreography:

The film&#x27;s choreographers were Dee Dee Wood and her husband Marc Breaux. Walt Disney attended the rehearsals for the rooftop scenes every day.

== Music ==

The film features music and lyrics by brothers Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman, who took inspiration from Edwardian British music hall music. Irwin Kostal arranged and conducted the score. Buena Vista Records released the original soundtrack in 1964 on LP and reel-to-reel tape. Even though RCA Victor Records released a record club edition, it is considered the pivotal release for Disney&#x27;s in-house record division, selling in the millions. The songs were among the most covered by famous artists such as Johnny Mathis, Louis Prima, and Ray Conniff, and even cartoon characters such as The Chipmunks and The Flintstones.

==Release==
&quot;Mary Poppins&quot; premiered on August 27, 1964, at Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles. The film&#x27;s poster was painted by artist Paul Wenzel. Travers was not extended an invitation to the event, but managed to obtain one from a Disney executive. It was at the after-party that Richard Sherman recalled her walking up to Disney and loudly announcing that the animated sequence had to go. Disney responded, &quot;Pamela, the ship has sailed&quot; and walked away.

===Home media===
&quot;Mary Poppins&quot; was released in late 1980 on VHS, Betamax, CED and LaserDisc. The first version features a VHS cover of Mary Poppins flying with her umbrella. The 2nd release in November 1982 has a cropped image of Mary, Bert, and the Children from the &quot;Stepintime&quot; roof dance fireworks scene, while the 3rd release on November 6, 1985, has a full-length picture on its cover. The 4th and final release, on October 4, 1988, as part of the Walt Disney Home Video collection, features the Penguin dance. On October 28, 1994, August 26, 1997, and March 31, 1998, it was rereleased three times as part of the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection. In 1998, the film became Disney&#x27;s first feature film released on DVD. On July 4, 2000, it was released on VHS and DVD as part of the Gold Classic Collection. On December 14, 2004, it had a 2-disc DVD release in a Digitally Restored 40th Anniversary Edition as well as its final issue in the VHS format. The film&#x27;s audio track featured an &quot;Enhanced Home Theater Mix&quot; consisting of updated sound effects, improved fidelity and mixing, and some enhanced music (this version was also shown on its 2006–2012 ABC Family airings), but the DVD included the original soundtrack as an audio option.

On January 27, 2009, the film was rereleased on DVD as a 45th anniversary edition, with more language tracks and special features (though the film&#x27;s &quot;Enhanced Home Theater Mix&quot; was not included). Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released it on Blu-ray as the &quot;50th Anniversary Edition&quot; on December 10, 2013. In February 2024, the British Board of Film Classification reclassified &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; from U to a PG due to Admiral Boom&#x27;s use of the word &quot;hottentot&quot; to refer to the dancing chimney sweeps.

The film was re-released theatrically in 1973, in honor of Walt Disney Productions&#x27; 50th anniversary, and earned an estimated additional $9 million in rentals in the United States and Canada. It was released once more in 1980 and grossed $14 million. It returned a total lifetime rental of $45 million in the United States and Canada to Disney from a gross of over $102 million.

It was the 20th most popular sound film of the 20th century in the United Kingdom with admissions of 14 million.

The film was very profitable for Disney. Made on an estimated budget of $4.4–6 million, it was reported by Cobbett Steinberg to be the most profitable film of 1965, earning a net profit of $28.5 million. Walt Disney used his huge profits from the film to purchase land in central Florida and finance the construction of Walt Disney World.

===Critical response===
The film received universal acclaim from critics. Whitney Williams of &quot;Variety&quot; praised its musical sequences and Andrews&#x27; and Van Dyke&#x27;s performances in particular. &quot;Time&quot; lauded the film, stating, &quot;The sets are luxuriant, the songs lilting, the scenario witty but impeccably sentimental, and the supporting cast only a pinfeather short of perfection.&quot; Bosley Crowther, reviewing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, described the film as a &quot;most wonderful, cheering movie … for the visual and aural felicities they have added to this sparkling color film—the enchantments of a beautiful production, some deliciously animated sequences, some exciting and nimble dancing and a spinning musical score—make it the nicest entertainment that has opened at the Music Hall this year.&quot;

For &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, James Powers applauded the performances, visual effects, musical score, production design, and choreography, and commented: &quot;&quot;Mary Poppins&quot; is a picture that is, more than most, a triumph of many individual contributions. And its special triumph is that it seems to be the work of a single, cohesive intelligence.&quot; Ann Guerin of &quot;Life&quot; criticized the creative departures from the novels, particularly the &quot;Jolly Holiday&quot; sequence. She noted that &quot;[s]ome of the sequences have real charm, and perhaps the kids will eat them up. But speaking as a grownup, I found a little bit went a long way.&quot; She concluded, &quot;With a little more restraint and a little less improvement on the original, the film&#x27;s many charms would have been that much better.&quot;

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of . The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;A lavish modern fairy tale celebrated for its amazing special effects, catchy songs, and Julie Andrews&#x27;s legendary performance in the title role.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 88 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Critic Drew Casper summarized the impact of &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; in 2011:

===Accolades===
== Legacy ==

&quot;Mary Poppins&quot; is widely considered Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;crowning achievement&quot;. It was the only Disney film to receive a Best Picture nomination in his lifetime.

Some of the profits from the film were used to build the Walt Disney World Monorail System; reflecting this is the MAPO (MAry POppins) safety system included on all Disney monorails. Walt Disney World&#x27;s Railroad steam locomotives are also fitted with a boiler safety device marked &quot;MAPO&quot;.

Never at ease with the handling of her property by Disney or the way she felt she had been treated, Travers never agreed to another Poppins/Disney adaptation. So fervent was her dislike of the Disney adaptation, and of how she felt she had been treated during the production, that when producer Cameron Mackintosh approached her about the stage musical in the 1990s, she acquiesced on the conditions that he use only English-born writers and that no one from the film production be directly involved.

=== Sequel ===

On December 19, 2018, Walt Disney Pictures released the film &quot;Mary Poppins Returns&quot;. The film takes place 25 years after the original, &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, and features a standalone narrative based on the remaining seven books in the series. Rob Marshall directed, while John DeLuca and Marc Platt served as producers, with Emily Blunt starring as Poppins, co-starring Broadway actor Lin-Manuel Miranda. Dick Van Dyke returned to portray Mr. Dawes Jr. Karen Dotrice also appeared in a cameo role.

===TV airings===
The ABC television network currently owns the broadcast rights to the film. It most recently aired on November 28, 2024, which was preceded the previous day by a 20/20 special about the making of the film, “The Untold Story of Mary Poppins”, featuring previously unreleased production footage.

The documentary includes conversations with Dick Van Dyke, Josh Gad, Lin-Manuel Miranda, and Walt Disney’s grandchildren. Julie Andrews also shared her memories of creating the original film.

== In popular culture ==
* Two episodes of &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; reference the film. In the episode &quot;The Hunter,&quot;, Ginger says &quot;Are you Mary Ann or Mary Poppins?&quot; In &quot;And Then There Were None,&quot; Gilligan dreams he is on trial with Mary Poppins as his lawyer.
* In Neil Simon&#x27;s film version of &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; (1968), Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau) says to his friends, &quot;You get this one stinkin&#x27; night a week. I&#x27;m cooped up here with Mary Poppins twenty-four hours a day&quot; (referring to Felix Unger (Jack Lemmon).
* The film inspired the eighth season episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; titled &quot;Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious&quot;, featuring a parody of Mary called &quot;Shary Bobbins&quot; who helps out the Simpson family after Marge loses her hair due to stress, and spoofs of the songs &quot;The Perfect Nanny&quot;, &quot;A Spoonful of Sugar&quot;, &quot;Feed the Birds&quot; and &quot;The Life I Lead&quot;.
* In Season 3 Episode 4 of &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;, Buddy Sorrell (Morey Amsterdam) is brainstorming about ideas for &quot;The Alan Brady Show&quot; and says, &quot;how about if Alan comes out as a cockney chimney sweep but he is getting so fat he can&#x27;t get down the chimney.&quot; Since the episode&#x27;s air date (October 16, 1963) was after &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; finished filming (in September 1963) but before the film premiered (in 1964), this was both a wink to those behind the scenes who knew &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; was on the way and a nod to the character Dick Van Dyke plays in the movie.
* In The Baby-Sitters Club books, Stacey takes a group of children on a shambolic outing to the Embassy Theatre to see &quot;Mary Poppins.&quot;
* The penguin waiters and a silhouette of Mary Poppins appeared in &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, although the same penguins also appear by themselves on &quot;House of Mouse&quot; and &quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot;.
* In &quot;The Boss Baby&quot;, the titular character refers to Euguena the babysitter as &quot;Scary Poppins&quot; upon being captured along with his brother, Tim.
* In &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2&quot;, Peter Quill tells Yondu Udonta that he looks like Mary Poppins, and then, Yondu Udonta yells, &quot;I&#x27;m Mary Poppins, y&#x27;all!&quot;

<doc id="77857" wikidata="Q366959" url="?curid=77857" title="Jackson County, Alabama">
<text>Jackson County is the northeasternmost county in the U.S. state of Alabama. As of the 2020 census, the population was 52,579. The county seat is Scottsboro. The county was named for Andrew Jackson, general in the United States Army and afterward President of the United States of America. Jackson County is a prohibition or dry county, but three cities within the county (Bridgeport, Scottsboro, and Stevenson) are &quot;wet&quot;, allowing alcohol sales. Jackson County comprises the Scottsboro, AL Micropolitan Statistical Area, and Jackson county is included in the Chattanooga–Cleveland–Dalton combined statistical area. It is the site of Russell Cave National Monument, an archeological site with evidence of 8,000 years of human occupation in the Southeast.

==History==
Jackson County was established on December 13, 1819, after the federal government arranged a treaty to remove the Cherokee from the area and extinguish their land claims. The hilly and mountainous terrain of the Appalachians made the area unsuitable for the plantation-style agriculture of the lowlands and coastal area. It was settled largely by families from Tennessee, South Carolina, and Georgia.

This area was developed largely for subsistence farming, and few families held any slaves. For instance, in 1860, Bellefonte, Alabama, then the county seat and largest community in the county, had a population of 181, of whom eight were free blacks and the remainder were white. No slaves were recorded in that community.

The county is crossed by a number of rivers and waterways; the most important is the Tennessee River, which drains most of the county. The current county seat of Scottsboro developed along the river, and was also the site of a railroad station when railroads reached the area. Hydroelectric power was developed in the first quarter of the 20th century to generate energy for industry. By the mid-20th century, industry had replaced agriculture as the most important element of the economy.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (%) is water. It is the fifth-largest county in Alabama by total area. Much of it is located in the Appalachians.

Of special interest is Russell Cave National Monument, which is located in Doran Cove, approximately 5 miles west of the town of Bridgeport. It is believed to offer &quot;one of the most complete records of prehistoric culture in the southeast United States.&quot; Russell Cave was declared a National Monument in May 1961 by President John F. Kennedy. The Monument consists of of land donated by the National Geographic Society.

The cave is an important archaeological site that was excavated in 1956 by the Smithsonian Institution and the National Geographic Society. The October 1956 issue of &quot;National Geographic Magazine&quot; featured an article reporting, &quot;Life 8,000 Years Ago Uncovered in an Alabama Cave.&quot; Evidence was found of human occupation of the cave from 6200 B.C. to A.D. 1650. The article was written by Carl F. Miller, the expedition leader. There have been follow-up studies about this site.

==Politics==
While most of North Alabama became solidly Republican during the 1970s, Jackson County remained a stronghold of the Democratic Party for elections to local office up through the 2000s (however, like many Southern Democrats, the county&#x27;s voters are not liberal). Until November 2012, Democrats were elected to Jackson County government. In that year&#x27;s general election, two Republicans were elected to the Jackson County Commission—the first Republicans to serve on the Commission since Reconstruction.

There is now an all-Republican political delegation in Jackson County. Tommy Hanes and Ritchie Whorton represent the county in the Alabama House of Representatives. Steve Livingston serves Jackson County in the Alabama State Senate. In 2004, Jackson County voted for Republican George W. Bush over Democrat John Kerry. It was the first time Jackson County voters had chosen a Republican presidential candidate over a Democrat since 1972.

In 2008, Republican presidential nominee John McCain won the county with 67.7 percent of the vote. In 2010, Republican gubernatorial candidate Robert J. Bentley received 56% of the vote, Republican House candidate Mo Brooks received 55% of the vote, and incumbent Senator Richard Shelby received 70% in the county. However, Democratic politicians continued to be elected to local positions such as County Sheriff and the school board.

The current Jackson County Commission is headed by Chairman General Willie Nance Jr.

<text>John Alec Entwistle (9 October 194427 June 2002) was an English musician, best known as the bass guitarist for the rock band the Who. Entwistle&#x27;s music career spanned over four decades. Nicknamed &quot;The Ox&quot; and &quot;Thunderfingers&quot;, he was the band&#x27;s only member with formal musical training and also provided backing and occasional lead vocals. Entwistle was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Who in 1990.

Renowned for his musical abilities, Entwistle is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential rock bass guitarists of all time. His instrumental approach utilized pentatonic lead lines and a then-unusual treble-rich sound (&quot;full treble, full volume&quot;). He was voted as the greatest bass guitar player ever in a 2011 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; readers&#x27; poll and, in 2020, the same magazine ranked him number three in its list of the &quot;50 Greatest Bassists of All Time&quot;.

== Early life ==
John Alec Entwistle was born on 9 October 1944 at Queen Charlotte&#x27;s Hospital in Hammersmith, London, and brought up in Chiswick, Middlesex, which is now part of London. He was an only child. His father, Herbert (1915 - 2003), played the trumpet and his mother, Maud (née Lee) (29 November 1922 – 4 March 2011), played the piano. His parents&#x27; marriage failed soon after he was born, and he was mostly raised by his mother at his grandparents&#x27; house in South Acton. Divorce was uncommon in the 1940s, and this contributed to Entwistle becoming reserved and socialising little.

His musical career began at age 7, when he started taking piano lessons. He did not enjoy the experience and after joining Acton County Grammar School aged 11, switched to the trumpet, moving to the French horn when he joined the Middlesex Schools Symphony Orchestra. He met Pete Townshend in the second year of school, and the two formed a trad jazz band, the Confederates. The group only played one gig together, before they decided that rock and roll was a more attractive prospect. Entwistle, in particular, was having difficulty hearing his trumpet with rock bands, and decided to switch to playing guitar, but due to his large fingers, and also his fondness for the low guitar tones of Duane Eddy, he decided to take up the bass instead. He made his own instrument at home, and soon attracted the attention of Roger Daltrey, who had been in the year above Entwistle at Acton County, but had been expelled and was working as an electrician&#x27;s mate. Daltrey was aware of Entwistle from school, and asked him to join as a bassist for his band, the Detours.

== Career ==
=== The Who ===

After joining the Detours, Entwistle played a major role in encouraging Pete Townshend&#x27;s budding talent on the guitar, and insisting that Townshend be admitted into the band as well. At this point the band consisted of Entwistle, Townshend and drummer Doug Sandom, a semi-professional player who was several years older than the others. Daltrey relinquished the role of guitarist to Townshend in 1963, instead becoming frontman and lead vocalist.

The band considered several changes of name, finally settling on the name the Who while Entwistle was still working as a tax clerk (temporarily performing as the High Numbers for four months in 1964). When the band decided that the blond Daltrey needed to stand out more from the others, Entwistle dyed his naturally light brown hair black, and it remained so until the early 1980s. Around 1963, Entwistle played in a London band called the Initials for a short while; the band broke up when a planned resident engagement in Spain fell through.

Entwistle picked up two nicknames during his career as a musician. He was nicknamed &quot;The Ox&quot; because of his strong constitution and seeming ability to &quot;eat, drink or do more than the rest of them&quot;. He was also later nicknamed &quot;Thunderfingers&quot;. Bill Wyman, bassist for the Rolling Stones, described him as &quot;the quietest man in private but the loudest man on stage&quot;. Entwistle was one of the first to make use of Marshall stacks in an attempt to hear himself over the noise of his band members, who famously leapt and moved about on the stage, with Townshend and Keith Moon smashing their instruments on numerous occasions (Moon even used explosives in his drum kit during one television performance on &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;). Townshend later remarked that Entwistle started using Marshall amplification to hear himself over Moon&#x27;s rapid-fire drumming style, and Townshend himself also had to use them just to be heard over Entwistle. They both continued expanding and experimenting with their rigs, until they were both using twin stacks with new experimental prototype 200 watt amps, at a time when most bands used 50–100 watt amplifiers with single cabinets. All of this quickly gained the Who a reputation for being &quot;the loudest band on the planet&quot;; they reached 126 decibels at a 1976 concert in London, listed in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; as the loudest rock concert in history.

The band had a strong influence at the time on their contemporaries&#x27; choice of equipment, with Cream and the Jimi Hendrix Experience both following suit. Although they pioneered and directly contributed to the development of the &quot;classic&quot; Marshall sound (at this point their equipment was being built or tweaked to their personal specifications), they only used Marshall equipment for a few years. Entwistle eventually switched to using a Sound City rig, with Townshend later following suit. Townshend points out that Jimi Hendrix, their new label mate, was influenced beyond just the band&#x27;s volume. Both Entwistle and Townshend had begun experimenting with feedback from the amplifiers in the mid-1960s, and Hendrix did not begin destroying his instruments until after he had witnessed the Who&#x27;s &quot;auto-destructive art&quot;.

Entwistle&#x27;s wry and sometimes dark sense of humour clashed at times with Townshend&#x27;s more introspective, intellectual work. Although he wrote songs on every Who studio album except for &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;, Entwistle was frustrated at Daltrey not allowing him to sing them himself. As he said, &quot;I got a couple [of songs] on per album but my problem was that I wanted to sing the songs and not let Roger sing them.&quot; This was a large part of the reason that he became the first member of the band to release a solo studio album, &quot;Smash Your Head Against the Wall&quot; (1971), which featured contributions from Keith Moon, Jerry Shirley of Humble Pie, Vivian Stanshall, Neil Innes and the Who&#x27;s roadie, Dave &quot;Cyrano&quot; Langston.

He was the only member of the band to have had formal musical training. In addition to the bass guitar, he contributed backing vocals and performed the French horn (heard on &quot;Pictures of Lily&quot; and throughout &quot;Tommy&quot;), trumpet, piano, bugle, and Jew&#x27;s harp, and on some occasions he sang the lead vocals on his compositions. He layered several horns to create the brass section as heard on songs such as &quot;5:15&quot;, among others, while recording the Who&#x27;s studio albums, and for concerts, arranged a horn section to perform with the band.

While Entwistle was known for being the quietest member of the Who, he in fact often exerted major influences on the rest of the band. For instance, Entwistle was the first member of the band to wear a Union Jack waistcoat. This piece of clothing later became one of Townshend&#x27;s signature garments.

In 1974, he compiled &quot;Odds &amp; Sods&quot;, a collection of unreleased Who material. Entwistle designed the cover art for the band&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;The Who by Numbers&quot; (1975), and in a 1996 interview remarked that it had cost £30 to create, while the &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; cover, designed by Pete Townshend, had cost £16,000.

Entwistle also experimented throughout his career with &#x27;Bi-amping&#x27;, where the high and low ends of the bass are sent through separate signal paths, allowing for more control over the output. At one point his rig became so loaded down with speaker cabinets and processing gear that it was dubbed &quot;Little Manhattan&quot;, in reference to the towering, skyscraper-like stacks, racks and blinking lights.

==== Songwriting ====
While Townshend emerged as the Who&#x27;s songwriter-in-chief, Entwistle began making distinctive contributions to the band&#x27;s catalogue, beginning with &quot;Whiskey Man&quot; and &quot;Boris the Spider&quot; on the band&#x27;s second studio album &quot;A Quick One&quot; (1966), continuing with &quot;Doctor, Doctor&quot; and &quot;Someone&#x27;s Coming&quot; (1967); &quot;Silas Stingy&quot;, &quot;Heinz Baked Beans&quot; and &quot;Medac&quot; from the band&#x27;s third studio album &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot; (1967); &quot;Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. Hyde&quot; (1968); and &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;, with which the Who opened their live shows between 1968 and 1970.

Entwistle wrote &quot;Cousin Kevin&quot; and &quot;Fiddle About&quot; for the Who&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;Tommy&quot; (1969) because Townshend had specifically requested Entwistle to write &#x27;nasty songs&#x27; that he felt uncomfortable with. &quot;My Wife&quot;, Entwistle&#x27;s driving, comedic song about marital strife from the band&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot; (1971), also became a popular stage number. He wrote &quot;Success Story&quot; for &quot;The Who by Numbers&quot; (1975), for which he also drew the illustration on the album cover; &quot;Had Enough&quot;, &quot;905&quot;, and &quot;Trick of the Light&quot; for &quot;Who Are You&quot; (1978); &quot;The Quiet One&quot; and &quot;You&quot; for &quot;Face Dances&quot; (1981); and &quot;It&#x27;s Your Turn&quot;, &quot;Dangerous&quot; and &quot;One at a Time&quot; for &quot;It&#x27;s Hard&quot; (1982), his final studio album with the Who.

=== Other work ===
==== Solo career ====
In 1971, Entwistle became the first member of the band to release a solo studio album, &quot;Smash Your Head Against the Wall&quot;, which earned him a cult following in the US for fans of his brand of black humour. Other solo studio albums included: &quot;Whistle Rymes&quot; (1972), &quot;Rigor Mortis Sets In&quot; (1973), &quot;Mad Dog&quot; (1975), &quot;Too Late the Hero&quot; (1981), and &quot;The Rock&quot; (1996). The band was preoccupied with recording &quot;The Who by Numbers&quot; during the spring of 1975 and did not do any touring for most of the year, so Entwistle spent the summer performing solo concerts. He also fronted the John Entwistle Band with band mate and business partner Steve Luongo on US club tours during the 1990s, and appeared with Ringo Starr &amp; His All-Starr Band in 1995. A talented visual artist, Entwistle held regular exhibitions of his paintings, with many of them featuring the Who. In 1984, he became the first artist besides Arlen Roth to record an instructional video for Roth&#x27;s company Hot Licks Video.

==== Later years ====
In 1990, Entwistle toured with the Best, a short-lived supergroup which included Keith Emerson of Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, Joe Walsh of the Eagles, Jeff &quot;Skunk&quot; Baxter of Steely Dan and the Doobie Brothers, and session musician Simon Phillips. Towards the end of his career, he formed the John Entwistle Band with longtime friend, drummer Steve Luongo, and guitarist Mark Hitt, both formerly of Rat Race Choir. This evolved into the John Entwistle Band, with Godfrey Townsend replacing Mark Hitt on guitar and joining harmony vocals. In 1996, the band went on the &quot;Left for Dead&quot; tour with Alan St. Jon joining on keyboards. After Entwistle toured with the Who for &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; in 1996–97, the John Entwistle Band set off on the &quot;Left for Dead – the Sequel&quot; tour in late 1998, now with Gordon Cotten on keyboards. After this second venture, the band released an album of highlights from the tour, titled &quot;Left for Live&quot; and a studio album &quot;Music from Van-Pires&quot; in 2000. The album featured lost demos of Who drummer Keith Moon together with newly recorded parts by the band.

In 1995, Entwistle also toured and recorded with Ringo Starr in one of the incarnations of Starr&#x27;s All-Starr Band. This one also featured Billy Preston, Randy Bachman of the Guess Who, and Mark Farner of Grand Funk Railroad. In this ensemble, he played and sang &quot;Boris the Spider&quot; as his Who showpiece, along with &quot;My Wife&quot;. Toward the end of his career he used a Status Graphite Buzzard Bass, which he had designed. From 1999 to early 2002, he played as part of the Who. Entwistle also played at Woodstock &#x27;99, along with Mickey Hart of the Grateful Dead, being the only performers there to have taken the stage at the original Woodstock. As a side project, he played the bass guitar in a country rock studio album project of original songs called the Pioneers, with Mickey Wynne on lead guitar, Ron Magness on rhythm guitar and keyboards, Roy Michaels, Andre Beeka on vocals, and John Delgado playing drums. The album was released by Voiceprint Records. Shortly before his death, Entwistle had agreed to play some US dates with the band including Nashville&#x27;s &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;, following his final upcoming tour with the Who.

In 2001, he played in Alan Parsons&#x27; Beatles tribute show &quot;A Walk Down Abbey Road&quot;. The show also featured Ann Wilson of Heart, Todd Rundgren, David Pack of Ambrosia, Godfrey Townsend, Steve Luongo and John Beck of It Bites. That year he also played with the Who at the Concert for New York City. He also joined forces again with the John Entwistle Band for an 8-gig tour. This time Chris Clark played keyboards. From January–February 2002, Entwistle played his last concerts with the Who in a handful of dates in England, the last being on 8 February at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall. In late 2002, an expanded 2-CD &quot;Left for Live Deluxe&quot; was released, highlighting the John Entwistle Band&#x27;s performances.

==== Art ====
Between 1996 and 2002, Entwistle attended dozens of art openings in his honour. He chatted with each collector, personalising their art with a quote and a sketch of &quot;Boris&quot;. In early 2002, Entwistle finished what was his last drawing. &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; represented a new style for Entwistle. Featuring Jimi Hendrix, Pete Townshend, Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin and Eric Clapton, Entwistle&#x27;s style had evolved from simple line drawings and caricatures to a more lifelike representation of his subjects. He was more confident and relaxed with his art and ready to share that with his collectors.

Entwistle wrote this on one of his pictures:
Now ... ! I&#x27;m still the bass guitarist. If you&#x27;re reading this bio at a show – don&#x27;t forget to wave – I&#x27;m the one on the left. If you&#x27;re reading this at an art show – Help support a starving Artist BUY SOMETHING!

== Personal life ==
In 1967, Entwistle married his childhood sweetheart, Alison Wise. He bought a large semi-detached home in Stanmore, London, filling it with all sorts of extraordinary artefacts, ranging from suits of armour to a tarantula. His eccentricity and taste for the bizarre was to remain with him throughout his life, and when he finally moved out of the city in 1978, to Stow-on-the-Wold in Gloucestershire, his 17-bedroom Victorian manor, Quarwood, resembled a museum. It also housed one of the largest guitar collections belonging to any rock musician.

Entwistle and Wise had a son, Christopher, in 1972. The marriage ended in divorce and Entwistle later married Maxene Harlow. At the time of his death, his long-term partner was 
Lisa Pritchett-Johnson.

== Death and legacy ==
Entwistle died in Room 658 at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Paradise, Nevada, on 27 June 2002, one day before the scheduled first show of the Who&#x27;s 2002 United States tour. He was 57 years old. Entwistle had gone to bed that night with Alycen Rowse, a local stripper and groupie, who awoke the next morning to find Entwistle cold and unresponsive. The Clark County medical examiner determined that his death was due to a heart attack induced by an undetermined amount of cocaine. Entwistle already had severe heart disease and usually smoked 20 cigarettes a day.

Entwistle had undergone a medical examination for insurance purposes before the Who&#x27;s 2002 tour started. The exam revealed high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Entwistle&#x27;s authorised biographer Paul Rees has suggested that a more detailed physical examination would have revealed that three of his arteries were blocked and necessitated surgery.

His funeral was held at St Edward&#x27;s Church in Stow-on-the-Wold, Gloucestershire, England, on 10 July 2002. His body was cremated and his ashes were buried privately in the grounds of his mansion, Quarwood. A memorial service was held on 24 October at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Trafalgar Square, London. Long time friend and band mate Steve Luongo was invited by The Who and John&#x27;s family to deliver the eulogy.

Entwistle&#x27;s huge collection of guitars and basses was auctioned at Sotheby&#x27;s in London by his son, Christopher, to meet anticipated taxes on his father&#x27;s estate.

On Pete Townshend&#x27;s website, Townshend and Roger Daltrey published a tribute, saying, &quot;The Ox has left the building—we&#x27;ve lost another great friend. Thanks for your support and love. Pete and Roger.&quot;

Entwistle&#x27;s mansion, Quarwood, and some of his personal effects were later sold off to meet the demands of the Inland Revenue; he had worked for the agency from 1962 to 1963 as a tax officer before being demoted to filing clerk, prior to joining the Who.

One aspect of Entwistle&#x27;s life which emerged after his death came as a surprise even to those closest to him, including the members of the Who. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t until the day of his funeral that I discovered that he&#x27;d spent most of his life as a Freemason&quot;, said Townshend. 

Welsh bassist Pino Palladino, who had previously played on several of Townshend&#x27;s solo studio albums, took over for Entwistle onstage when the Who resumed their postponed US tour on 1 July 2002. Townshend and Daltrey spoke at length about their reaction to Entwistle&#x27;s death. Some of their comments can be found on &quot;The Who Live in Boston&quot; DVD.

On the opening night of their &quot;Vapor Trails&quot; tour, which began in Hartford, Connecticut on 28 June 2002 (the night after Entwistle&#x27;s death), Geddy Lee of Rush dedicated the band&#x27;s performance of the song &quot;Between Sun and Moon&quot; to Entwistle.

Pearl Jam&#x27;s seventh studio album &quot;Riot Act&quot;, released in late 2002, was dedicated to Entwistle, among others.

Oasis played a cover version of &quot;My Generation&quot; during their Summer 2002 European Tour as a tribute to Entwistle. Beady Eye&#x27;s single &quot;The Beat Goes On&quot;, from their 2011 album &quot;Different Gear, Still Speeding&quot;, contains a reference to Entwistle and bandmate Keith Moon, with the lyric: &quot;The Ox and Moon were counting me in, I had to give in&quot;.

In some concerts of the Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; By the Way Tour, such as the gig at Slane Castle in 2003, Flea got on stage wearing a version of the skeleton suit Entwistle wore during the Who&#x27;s 1970 tour, as a tribute.

== Technique ==
Entwistle&#x27;s playing technique incorporated fingerstyle, plectrum, tapping, and the use of harmonics. He changed his style between songs and even during songs to alter the sound he produced. His fingering technique involved plucking strings very forcefully to produce a trebly, twangy sound. He changed his thumb position from pick-up to the E string and occasionally even positioned his thumb near the pick-up. His plectrum technique involved holding the plectrum between his thumb and forefinger, with the rest of his fingers outstretched for balance.

The Who&#x27;s studio recordings seldom did justice to Entwistle&#x27;s playing, in part because he was better heard in concert, where he and Pete Townshend frequently exchanged roles, with Entwistle providing rapid melodic lines and Townshend anchoring the song with rhythmic chord work. At the same time, Townshend noted that Entwistle provided the true rhythmic timekeeping in the band, while Keith Moon, with his flourishes around the kit, was more like a keyboardist. In 1989, Entwistle pointed out that, by modern standards, &quot;the Who haven&#x27;t got a proper bass player.&quot;

Entwistle also developed what he called a &quot;typewriter&quot; approach to playing the bass. It involved positioning his right hand over the strings so all four fingers could be used to tap percussively on the strings, causing them to strike the fretboard with a distinctive twangy sound. This gave him the ability to play three or four strings at once, or to use several fingers on a single string. It allowed him to create passages that were both percussive and melodic. This method should not be confused with tapping or slapping, and in fact predates these techniques. Modern players such as Ryan Martinie of heavy metal band Mudvayne have used similar techniques. Entwistle can be seen using this technique in Mike Gordon&#x27;s documentary film, &quot;Rising Low&quot; (2002). Notable in his left-hand technique was his use of slides, positioning his left hand for octaves, and his use of the pentatonic when playing with the Who.

Entwistle was notorious for the extremely high volume at which he played bass, going so far as to rig pick-ups to each string on his instruments. This led to him developing hearing loss, similar to Townshend. Although not as public about his problems as Townshend, he reputedly had to rely on lip reading to understand speech in his later years. Randy Bachman of Bachman–Turner Overdrive claimed that towards the end of his life, Entwistle mostly played by feeling the rush of air from his giant amp stacks. Entwistle blamed his hearing loss on using headphones.

== Influence ==
Entwistle identified his influences as a combination of his school training on French horn, trumpet, and piano (giving his fingers strength and dexterity). Musicians who influenced him included rock and roll guitarist Duane Eddy, and American soul and R&amp;B bassists such as James Jamerson. In turn, Entwistle has been a considerable influence on the playing styles and sounds used by generations of bassists that have followed him, including Tom Hamilton, Brian Gibson, Geezer Butler, Krist Novoselic, Geddy Lee, Billy Sheehan, Victor Wooten, Tom Petersson, John Myung and Chris Squire.

Entwistle continues to top &#x27;best ever bass player&#x27; polls in musicians&#x27; magazines. In 2000, &quot;Guitar&quot; magazine named him &quot;Bassist of the Millennium&quot; in a readers&#x27; poll. J. D. Considine ranked Entwistle No. 9 on his list of &quot;Top 50 Bass Players&quot;. He was named the second best rock bassist on &quot;Creem Magazine&quot;&#x27;s 1974 Reader Poll Results. In 2011, a &quot;Rolling Stone Magazine&quot; reader poll selected him as the No. 1 rock bassist of all time.

== Equipment ==

Entwistle collaborated with bass guitar manufacturers such as Alembic, Warwick, and Status Graphite. His bass solo on the &quot;My Generation&quot; single was a Fender Jazz Bass with stock tapewound strings.

Entwistle&#x27;s collection of guitars and basses was auctioned at Sotheby&#x27;s in May 2003.

<doc id="77861" wikidata="Q723764" url="?curid=77861" title="Tatooine">
<text>Tatooine ( ) is a fictional desert planet that appears in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise. It is a beige-colored, desolate world orbiting a pair of binary stars, and inhabited by human settlers and a variety of other life forms. The planet was first seen in the original 1977 film &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and has to date featured in a total of seven &quot;Star Wars&quot; theatrical films, three live-action television series, and four animated series.

It is the home planet of the protagonist of the original Star Wars Trilogy, Luke Skywalker, and of his father, Anakin Skywalker (who later became Darth Vader). It is also the planet where Obi-Wan Kenobi takes up residence under the name &quot;Ben Kenobi&quot; in order to watch over Luke during the former&#x27;s exile following the events of Order 66 and Anakin&#x27;s fall to the dark side. Shots of the binary sunset over the Tatooine desert are considered to be an iconic image of the film series, along with the greatest sunset scenes in cinematic history.

==Development==
In his early drafts of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; story, author George Lucas changed the names of planets and characters several times. In his early treatment, Lucas opened the story on the fourth moon of the planet Utapau, the home of a young warrior called Annikin Starkiller. In Lucas&#x27;s rough draft, &quot;The Star Wars&quot; (1974), the escaping droids land in a desert on the planet Aquilae; in later drafts the planet again takes the name of Utapau. Prior to production, early artwork commissioned by Lucas from conceptual illustrator Ralph McQuarrie show robots lost on a desert world, scorched by twin suns and mysterious, masked Tusken Raiders riding large horned Banthas.
George Lucas originally envisaged filming the Utapau/Tatooine scenes in Algeria (inspired by Michelangelo Antonioni&#x27;s 1975 film &quot;The Passenger&quot;), Libya or Iran, but these locations were rejected by 20th Century Fox. When production began on &quot;Star Wars&quot;, production designers John Barry and Robert Watts scouted for filming locations in Morocco and Tunisia. Lucas, accompanied by producer Gary Kurtz visited the Tunisian island of Djerba with them and were impressed by the desert landscape and the unusual architecture, and selected Tunisia to provide the desert planet setting. Lucas was also keen to shoot at the Hotel Sidi Driss in Matmata, a decision which extended the shoot, and consequently the budget, by a day. Filming in Tunisia began on March 22, 1976, and immediately ran into difficulty: the region was experiencing its first heavy rainfall in seven years, which disrupted the setting of an arid desert planet. The Matmata hotel consisted of a dwelling in a large hole in the ground. Combined with shots at Chott el Djerid, near Nefta, this formed the setting for the Lars homestead and moisture farm. The landing site for and escape pod was filmed in sand dunes at La Grande Dune, near Nefta, and exterior shots of Mos Eisley spaceport were shot on Djerba. The name &quot;Tatooine&quot; is not actually mentioned in the final screenplay of &quot;Star Wars&quot;—Lucas was still working on his fourth draft while scouting locations, and adapted the name from a town in southern Tunisia called Tataouine (French spelling, or &quot;Tataween&quot; spelling in Tunisian Arabic).

Certain scenes filmed on Djerba were subsequently deleted from the final cut of the film in order to improve the narrative pace. The most significant material cut was a series of scenes set in the township of Anchorhead which served to introduce the characters of Luke Skywalker and Biggs Darklighter. Lucas asked film editor Richard Chew to cut these scenes as they had been likened to &quot;&quot;American Graffiti&quot; in outer space&quot; by Fox executives (in reference to Lucas&#x27;s 1973 film).
Footage filmed at Sidi Bouhlel in Tunisia was combined with 1977 second unit filming at Death Valley National Park in California to create the rocky canyon scenes featuring Jawas and Tusken Raiders.

When crews returned to Tunisia to film for the Star Wars prequel films in 1998, locations at Onk Jemal (Ong Jmal) in Tozeur, Ksar Ouled Soltane and Ksar Hadada, Ghomrassen were used for Tatooine scenes. Abandoned sets for the filming have been left in the desert but can be visited.

==Film appearances==
Tatooine originally featured in the 1977 film &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and was the first planet to be seen in the film franchise. In the opening scene, the planet and two of its moons are seen in space against a sea of stars, forming the backdrop of a space battle which sets in motion the events of the film. Two robots, and , jettison in an escape pod from a captured spaceship, the &quot;Tantive IV&quot;, and land on the surface of Tatooine. The droids lose their way in a sparse desert and are captured by small scavenger creatures called Jawas. When the robots are sold on to human settlers, protagonist Luke Skywalker is introduced as a young man living with his aunt and uncle on a farm. The hostility of the arid desert environment is emphasised by the depiction of sandstorms and the heat of the binary stars, as Luke watches a twin sunset over the sand dunes. Humans are constantly threatened by violent bandit creatures called Tusken Raiders. As the film progresses, various leading characters are introduced to the story in scenes set on Tatooine: Obi-Wan Kenobi, Han Solo and Chewbacca. Later Tatooine scenes take place in Mos Eisley, a gritty bustling spaceport on the planet which is a centre of smuggling and organised crime. One of the most celebrated scenes in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; saga is in the Mos Eisley cantina, a shady saloon populated by exotic alien species. Composer John Williams wrote music for the alien band in this scene in the style of swing musician Benny Goodman, and arranged with unusual instrumentation to convey an other-worldly sound. Tatooine features once again in the 1983 film &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, in which the story&#x27;s heroes return to Tatooine to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt, a fearsome gangster who dominates the criminal underworld on Tatooine.

When the prequel trilogy revived the film franchise in 1999, the action returned to Tatooine for &quot;Episode I: The Phantom Menace&quot; as the setting for the childhood of Luke&#x27;s father, Anakin Skywalker. Living as a slave in another spaceport, Mos Espa, Anakin competes in pod races, long-distance airborne races across the desert. The Jedi master Qui-Gon Jinn meets Anakin after making an emergency landing on the planet, and helps him win his freedom. In &quot;Episode II: Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002), an older Anakin returns to Tatooine to search for his mother, Shmi, who has been kidnapped by Tusken Raiders. The prequels depict a vast expanse of desert with jagged rock formations. Tatooine features once more in the final prequel film, &quot;Episode III: Revenge of the Sith&quot; (2005); in the closing scene, Obi-Wan Kenobi takes the infant Luke Skywalker and delivers him to his adoptive parents on the Tatooine moisture farm while he goes into hiding by residing in the Junland Wastelands which are in Tatooine&#x27;s mountainous areas, thus explaining his first appearance in that location in &quot;Episode IV&quot;.

Tatooine is featured in the climax of the animated film &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot; in which Anakin and his Padawan apprentice Ahsoka Tano return Jabba the Hutt&#x27;s kidnapped son to his palace. Tatooine again appears briefly at the end of &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot;, when Rey visits the remains of the Lars moisture farm.

==Description==

Located in an unknown galaxy&#x27;s desolate Outer Rim, Tatooine orbits a pair of binary stars,  I and  II. The planet&#x27;s indigenous lifeforms such as the womp rat, bantha, Sarlacc, and Krayt dragon are well-adapted to its arid climate. Though its proximity to the suns makes life difficult, it is located near key hyperspace routes, making it a smuggler and gangster haven; debris from shipwrecks also provides resources for scavengers. Annual sandstorms wipe out landmarks and make nomadic life dangerous, with the planet&#x27;s populations clustered into distinct settlements.

A small Imperial presence brings the planet an additional source of water, its most precious commodity. Though tasked to enforce the law, stormtroopers often overlook crime; an efficient black market also enables the procurement of illegal goods. Human settlers often become moisture farmers and live in subterranean dwellings in order to survive. Pipe systems distribute most of the harvested moisture to indoor crops supplying food for the farmers. Rare water sources such as springs in badlands (e.g. Beggar&#x27;s Canyon) provide hydration for hermits and Tusken Raiders.
The planet is dominated by the Hutts, a clan of gangsters and crime lords. Since Tatooine was beyond the reach of the Galactic Republic, the Hutts presided over the lawless planet with little outside interference. When the Galactic Empire subsumed the Old Republic, the new regime established only a token presence on Tatooine, which left Jabba the Hutt&#x27;s reign unchallenged until his death during the events depicted in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. In fact, during the reign of the Empire, some Tatooinians were skeptical that, should the Rebellion actually reach their planet, that the Empire would even bother to put up a fight to hold on to it. The planet gained notability in what is an unknown galaxy as the homeworld of Luke Skywalker.

==Inhabitants==

* Humans – Settlers
* Hutts – Wormlike crime lords
* Jawas – Humanoid rodent scavengers and traders, and one of the native life forms of Tatooine
* Tusken Raiders (or Sand People) – Fierce, nomadic humanoids and one of the native life forms of Tatooine

===Flora and fauna===
==Locations==
Because Tatooine features so prominently in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; film series, a wide range of locations has been represented on-screen.

===Settlements===
Although the planet is sparsely populated, settlements of varying size have provided the settings for many scenes in &quot;Star Wars&quot; films.

The first settlement to be shown is Anchorhead where many human settlers on Tatooine pursue a difficult agrarian existence on remote &quot;moisture farms&quot; in the desert, collecting water vapor from the atmosphere to grow crops. Among these moisture farmers is the young hero of the film, Luke Skywalker, who resides with his Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru at the Lars Homestead. The region is dangerous, with kidnappings by Tusken Raiders being a major problem, as shown in &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002), when Luke&#x27;s father Anakin, lost his mother to Tusken Raiders. In the original film, Luke also mentions Tosche Station (or Toshi Station), which was a mechanical repair shop featured in scenes that were deleted from the final cut of the original 1977 film. In the deleted scenes, Luke meets his young friends and bids farewell to Biggs Darklighter, who is about to leave to the Imperial Academy. The Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi is also in self-imposed exile near that region, although his house is remote from other houses, as he is hiding under the alias Ben.

Bestine is the &quot;capital&quot; of Tatooine; although it does not appear in any films, it is mentioned as &quot;Bestine township&quot; in the 1976 novelisation &quot;Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker&quot; and is featured prominently in &quot;Star Wars Galaxies&quot; video games. In the Expanded Universe, there is also a separate planet named &quot;Bestine&quot;.

Mos Pelgo briefly known as Freetown, was a town located in the northern hemisphere of the planet Tatooine. Seen in both &quot;Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Eternal Throne&quot; and &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;.

===Spaceports===
Two major spaceport locations have been shown on Tatooine:
*Mos Eisley (&quot;Star Wars&quot;, 1977) is the planet&#x27;s biggest city: a bustling spaceport with an active criminal underworld, described by Obi-Wan Kenobi a &quot;wretched hive of scum and villainy.&quot; This is the location of one of the most noted scenes in &quot;Star Wars&quot;, Chalmun&#x27;s Cantina, which is shown as a busy saloon bar-style establishment, patronised by exotic and often violent alien species. The Cantina additionally features as a location in Lego Star Wars video games and Fortnite. 

*Mos Espa (&quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, 1999) is home to the Boonta Eve Classic Podrace track. Anakin Skywalker spent his childhood in the city, along his mother Shmi; both were slaves under the ownership of Watto. Anakin became the first human to win the race against Sebulba and other Podracer pilots and earned his freedom in the process, due to a bet between Watto and Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn. The city&#x27;s depiction in &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; was intended to look larger than what was seen of Mos Eisley in the original &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

===Desert locations===
Tatooine is mostly a desert environment. Characters in the films make reference to the deserts by name: the Jundland Wastes, a rocky region, is the location of the Tusken Raider attack in &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977), and the neighboring Dune Sea (the basin of an ancient ocean) is the setting for Jabba the Hutt&#x27;s palace has the Rancor pit inside the palace. Also situated in the Dune Sea is the Great Pit of Carkoon, the lair of the deadly omnivorous Sarlacc creature.

==Theme park attraction==
Tatooine also appeared in the theme park attraction Star Tours - The Adventures Continue in Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios in Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida and Disneyland Park in Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California.

==Similarity to real planets==
The discovery of exoplanets in the real universe gained pace in the early 21st century. In 2015, the US space agency NASA published an article which stated that many of the newly discovered astronomical bodies possessed scientifically confirmed properties that are similar to planets in the fictional &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe. Among them, the planets TOI 1338 b, Kepler-16b and Kepler-453b have been likened to Tatooine because they have been discovered orbiting binary star systems. These planets are known as circumbinary planets.

==Influence==
The desert planet of Jakku in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; sequel trilogy film &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; (2015) has been noted as being very similar to Tatooine.

In August 2019, rapper Kanye West announced that he was designing prefabricated homes inspired by the settlements on Tatooine seen in &quot;A New Hope&quot; to serve as low-income housing. His prototypes in Calabasas, California were torn down after he was cited for not obtaining the proper permits and receiving complaints about the &quot;gumdrop-shaped&quot; structures. On July 5, 2020, West tweeted a photograph of similar structures being built to promote his presidential campaign.

The desert planet of Kerona in Space Quest I is a reference to Tatooine.

<text>Battleship Potemkin (, ), sometimes rendered as Battleship Potyomkin, is a 1925 Soviet silent epic film produced by Mosfilm. Directed and co-written by Sergei Eisenstein, it presents a dramatization of the mutiny that occurred in 1905 when the crew of the Russian battleship &quot;Potemkin&quot; rebelled against their officers.

In 1958, the film was voted on Brussels 12 list at the 1958 World Expo. &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot; is widely considered one of the greatest films of all time. In the most recent &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; critics&#x27; poll in 2022, it was voted the fifty-fourth-greatest film of all time, and it had been placed in the top 10 in many previous editions.

==Plot==

The film is set in June 1905; the protagonists of the film are the members of the crew of the &quot;Potemkin&quot;, a battleship of the Imperial Russian Navy&#x27;s Black Sea Fleet. Eisenstein divided the plot into five acts, each with its own title:

===Act I: Men and Maggots===
The scene begins with two sailors, Matyushenko and Vakulinchuk, discussing the need for the crew of the &quot;Potemkin&quot;, which is anchored off the island of Tendra, to support the revolution then taking place within Russia. After their watch, they and other off-duty sailors are sleeping. As an officer inspects the quarters, he stumbles and takes out his aggression on a sleeping sailor. The ruckus causes Vakulinchuk to awake, and he gives a speech to the men as they come to. Vakulinchuk says, &quot;Comrades! The time has come when we too must speak out. Why wait? All of Russia has risen! Are we to be the last?&quot; The scene cuts to morning, where sailors are remarking on the poor quality of the meat. The meat appears to be rotten and covered in maggots, and the sailors say that &quot;even a dog wouldn&#x27;t eat this!&quot; The ship&#x27;s doctor, Smirnov, is called over to inspect the meat by the captain. Rather than maggots, the doctor says that they are insects, and they can be washed off before cooking. The sailors further complain about the poor quality of the rations, but the doctor declares the meat edible and ends the discussion. Senior officer Giliarovsky forces the sailors still looking over the rotten meat to leave the area, and the cook begins to prepare borscht, although he too questions the quality of the meat. The crew refuses to eat the borscht, instead choosing bread, water, and canned goods. While cleaning dishes, one of the sailors sees an inscription on a plate which reads &quot;give us this day our daily bread&quot;. After considering the meaning of this phrase, the sailor smashes the plate and the scene ends.

===Act II: Drama on the Deck===
All those who refuse the meat are judged guilty of insubordination and are brought to the fore-deck where they receive religious last rites. The sailors are obliged to kneel and a canvas cover is thrown over them as a firing squad marches onto the deck. The First Officer gives the order to fire, but in response to Vakulinchuk&#x27;s pleas the sailors in the firing squad lower their rifles and the uprising begins. The sailors overwhelm the outnumbered officers and take control of the ship. The officers are thrown overboard, the ship&#x27;s priest is dragged out of hiding, and finally the doctor is thrown into the ocean as &#x27;food for the worms&#x27;. The mutiny is successful but Vakulinchuk, the charismatic leader of the rebels, is killed.

===Act III: The Dead Man Calls Out===
The &quot;Potemkin&quot; arrives at the port of Odessa. Vakulinchuk&#x27;s body is taken ashore and displayed publicly by his companions in a tent with a sign on his chest that says &quot;For a spoonful of borscht&quot; (Изъ-за ложки борща). The citizens of Odessa, saddened yet empowered by Vakulinchuk&#x27;s sacrifice, are soon whipped into a frenzy against the Tsar and his government by sympathizers. A man allied with the government tries to turn the citizens&#x27; fury against the Jews, but he is quickly shouted down and beaten by the people. The sailors gather to make a final farewell and praise Vakulinchuk as a hero. The people of Odessa welcome the sailors, but they attract the police as they mobilize against the government.

===Act IV: The Odessa Steps===
The citizenry of Odessa take to their boats, sailing out to the &quot;Potemkin&quot; to support the sailors, while a crowd of others gather at the Odessa steps to witness the happenings and cheer on the rebels. Suddenly a detachment of dismounted Cossacks form battle lines at the top of the steps and march toward a crowd of unarmed civilians including women and children, and begin firing and advancing with fixed bayonets. Every now and again, the soldiers halt to fire a volley into the crowd before continuing their impersonal, machine-like assault down the stairs, ignoring the people&#x27;s pleas. Meanwhile, government cavalry attack the fleeing crowd at the bottom of the steps as well, cutting down many of those who survived the dismounted assault. Brief sequences show individuals among the people fleeing or falling, a baby carriage rolling down the steps, a woman shot in the face, broken glasses, and the high boots of the soldiers moving in unison.

In retaliation, the sailors of the &quot;Potemkin&quot; use the guns of the battleship to fire on the city opera house, where Tsarist military leaders are convening a meeting. Meanwhile, there is news that a squadron of loyal warships is coming to quell the revolt of the &quot;Potemkin&quot;.

===Act V: One Against All===
The sailors of the &quot;Potemkin&quot; decide to take the battleship out from the port of Odessa to face the fleet of the Tsar, flying the red flag along with the signal &quot;Join us&quot;. Just when battle seems inevitable, the sailors of the Tsarist squadron refuse to open fire, cheering and shouting to show solidarity with the mutineers and allowing the &quot;Potemkin&quot; to pass between their ships.

==Production==
On the 20th anniversary of the first Russian revolution, the commemorative commission of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee decided to stage a number of performances dedicated to the revolutionary events of 1905. As part of the celebrations, it was suggested that a &quot;... grand film [be] shown in a special program, with an oratory introduction, musical (solo and orchestral) and a dramatic accompaniment based on a specially written text&quot;. Nina Agadzhanova was asked to write the script and direction of the picture was assigned to 27-year-old Sergei Eisenstein.

In the original script, the film was to highlight a number of episodes from the 1905 revolution: the Russo-Japanese War, Armenian–Tatar massacres of 1905–1907, revolutionary events in St. Petersburg and the Moscow uprising. Filming was to be conducted in a number of cities within the USSR.

Eisenstein hired many non-professional actors for the film; he sought people of specific types instead of famous stars.

Shooting began on 31 March 1925. Eisenstein began filming in Leningrad and had time to shoot the railway strike episode, horsecar, city at night and the strike crackdown on Sadovaya Street. Further shooting was prevented by deteriorating weather, with fog setting in. At the same time, the director faced tight time constraints: the film needed to be finished by the end of the year, although the script was approved only on 4 June. Eisenstein decided to give up the original script consisting of eight episodes, to focus on just one, the uprising on the battleship &quot;Potemkin&quot;, which involved just a few pages (41 frames) from Agadzhanova&#x27;s script. Eisenstein and Grigori Aleksandrov essentially recycled and extended the script. In addition, during the progress of making the film, some episodes were added that had existed neither in Agadzhanova&#x27;s script nor in Eisenstein&#x27;s scenic sketches, such as the storm scene with which the film begins. As a result, the content of the film was far removed from Agadzhanova&#x27;s original script.

The film was shot in Odessa, at that time a center of film production where it was possible to find a suitable warship for shooting.

The first screening of the film took place on 21 December 1925 at a ceremonial meeting dedicated to the anniversary of the 1905 revolution at the Bolshoi Theatre. The premiere was held in Moscow on 18 January 1926, in the 1st Goskinoteatre (now called the Khudozhestvenny).

The silent film received a voice dubbing in 1930, was restored in 1950 (composer Nikolai Kryukov) and reissued in 1976 (composer Dmitri Shostakovich) at Mosfilm with the participation of the USSR State Film Fund and the Museum of S.M. Eisenstein under the artistic direction of Sergei Yutkevich.

In 1925, after sale of the film&#x27;s negatives to Germany and reediting by director Phil Jutzi, &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot; was released internationally in a different version from that originally intended. The attempted execution of sailors was moved from the beginning to the end of the film. Later it was subjected to censorship, and in the USSR some frames and intermediate titles were removed. The words of Leon Trotsky in the prologue were replaced with a quote from Lenin. In 2005, under the overall guidance of the Foundation Deutsche Kinemathek, with the participation of the State Film Fund and the Russian State Archive of Literature and Art, the author&#x27;s version of the film was restored, including the music by Edmund Meisel.

The battleship &quot;Kniaz Potemkin Tarritcheski&quot;, later renamed &quot;Panteleimon&quot; and then &quot;Boretz Za Svobodu&quot;, was derelict and in the process of being scrapped at the time of the film shoot. It is usually stated that the battleship was used instead, but she was a very different design of vessel from that of the &quot;Potemkin&quot;, and the film footage matches the battleship more closely. The &quot;Rostislav&quot; had been scuttled in 1920, but her superstructure remained completely above water until 1930. Interior scenes were filmed on the cruiser . Stock footage of &quot;Potemkin&quot; was used to show her at sea, and stock footage of the French fleet depicted the waiting Russian Black Sea fleet. Anachronistic footage of triple-gun-turret Russian dreadnoughts was also included.

In the film, the rebels raise a red flag on the battleship, but the orthochromatic black-and-white film stock of the period made the color red look black, so a white flag was used instead. Eisenstein hand-tinted the flag in red in 108 frames for the premiere at the Grand Theatre, which was greeted with thunderous applause by the Bolshevik audience.

==Film style and content==
The film is composed of five episodes:
* &quot;Men and Maggots&quot; (), in which the sailors protest having to eat rotten meat.
* &quot;Drama on the Deck&quot; (), in which the sailors mutiny and their leader Vakulinchuk is killed.
* &quot;A Dead Man Calls for Justice&quot; (), in which Vakulinchuk&#x27;s body is mourned by the people of Odessa.
* &quot;The Odessa Steps&quot; (), in which imperial soldiers massacre the Odesans.
* &quot;One against all&quot; (), in which the squadron tasked with intercepting the Potemkin instead declines to engage; lowering their guns, its sailors cheer on the rebellious battleship and join the mutiny.

Eisenstein wrote the film as revolutionary propaganda, but also used it to test his theories of montage. The revolutionary Soviet filmmakers of the Kuleshov school of filmmaking were experimenting with the effect of film editing on audiences, and Eisenstein attempted to edit the film in such a way as to produce the greatest emotional response, so that the viewer would feel sympathy for the rebellious sailors of the Battleship &quot;Potemkin&quot; and hatred for their overlords. In the manner of most propaganda, the characterization is simple, so that the audience could clearly see with whom they should sympathize.
A notable example of Eisenstein&#x27;s montage technique is the sequence featuring the lion statues at the Vorontsov Palace in Crimea. The statues—a sleeping lion, a waking lion, and one rising to its feet—are edited in succession to create the illusion of movement, symbolizing the revolutionary awakening. These statues were modeled after the Medici Lions of Renaissance Italy, linking classical art to the film&#x27;s modern revolutionary themes.

Eisenstein&#x27;s experiment was a mixed success; he &quot;was disappointed when &quot;Potemkin&quot; failed to attract masses of viewers&quot;, but the film was also released in a number of international venues, where audiences responded positively. In both the Soviet Union and overseas, the film shocked audiences, but not so much for its political statements as for its use of violence, which was considered graphic by the standards of the time. The film&#x27;s potential to influence political thought through emotional response was noted by Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, who called &quot;Potemkin&quot; &quot;a marvelous film without equal in the cinema ... anyone who had no firm political conviction could become a Bolshevik after seeing the film.&quot; He was even interested in getting Germans to make a similar film. Eisenstein did not like the idea and wrote an indignant letter to Goebbels in which he stated that National Socialistic realism did not have either truth or realism. The film was not banned in Nazi Germany, although Heinrich Himmler issued a directive prohibiting SS members from attending screenings, as he deemed the movie inappropriate for the troops. The film was eventually banned in some countries, including the United States and France for a time, as well as in its native Soviet Union. The film was banned in the United Kingdom longer than was any other film in British history.

==The Odessa Steps sequence==
One of the most celebrated scenes in the film is the massacre of civilians on the Odessa Steps (also known as the Primorsky or Potemkin Stairs). This sequence has been assessed as a &quot;classic&quot; and one of the most influential in the history of cinema. In the scene, the Tsar&#x27;s soldiers in their white summer tunics march down a seemingly endless flight of steps in a rhythmic, machine-like fashion, firing volleys into a crowd. A separate detachment of mounted Cossacks charges the crowd at the bottom of the stairs. The victims include an older woman wearing pince-nez, a young boy with his mother, a student in uniform and a teenage schoolgirl. A mother pushing an infant in a baby carriage falls to the ground dying and the carriage rolls down the steps amid the fleeing crowd.

The massacre on the steps, although it did not take place in daylight or as portrayed, was based on the fact that there were widespread riots in other parts of the city, sparked off by the arrival of the &quot;Potemkin&quot; in Odessa Harbour. Both &quot;The Times&quot; and the resident British consul reported that troops fired on the rioters; deaths were reportedly in the hundreds. Roger Ebert writes, &quot;That there was, in fact, no tsarist massacre on the Odessa Steps scarcely diminishes the power of the scene ... It is ironic that [Eisenstein] did it so well that today, the bloodshed on the Odessa steps is often referred to as if it really happened.&quot;

===Treatment in other works of art===

The scene is perhaps the best example of Eisenstein&#x27;s theory on montage, and many films pay homage to the scene, including:

* Terry Gilliam&#x27;s &quot;Brazil&quot;
* Brian De Palma&#x27;s &quot;The Untouchables&quot;
* George Lucas&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot; 
* Tibor Takacs&#x27;s &quot;Deathline&quot;
* Laurel and Hardy&#x27;s &quot;The Music Box&quot;
* Chandrashekhar Narvekar&#x27;s Hindi film &quot;Tezaab&quot;
* Shukō Murase&#x27;s anime &quot;Ergo Proxy&quot;
* Peter Sellers&#x27; &quot;The Magic Christian&quot;
* &quot;The Children Thief&quot;
* Johnnie To&#x27;s &quot;Three&quot;
* Ettore Scola&#x27;s &quot;We All Loved Each Other So Much&quot;
* Denis Villeneuve&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot;

Several films spoof it, including 
* Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Bananas&quot; and &quot;Love and Death&quot;
* Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker&#x27;s &quot;Naked Gun : The Final Insult&quot; (though also a parody of &quot;The Untouchables&quot;)
* the Soviet-Polish comedy &quot;Deja Vu&quot;
* Jacob Tierney&#x27;s &quot;The Trotsky&quot;
* The short film &quot;Mr. Bill Goes to Washington&quot;
* The German–Turkish film &quot;Kebab Connection&quot;
* The 1999 direct-to-video film &quot;An American Tail: The Mystery of the Night Monster&quot;
* The Italian Fantozzi comedy film 

Non-film shows that parody the scene include:
* a 1996 episode of the American adult animated sitcom, &quot;Duckman&quot;, entitled &quot;The Longest Weekend&quot;
* a 2014 episode of &quot;Rake&quot; (Season 3, Episode 5)
Artists and others influenced by the work include:
* The Irish-born painter Francis Bacon (1909–1992). Eisenstein&#x27;s images profoundly influenced Bacon, particularly the Odessa Steps shot of the nurse&#x27;s broken glasses and open-mouthed scream. The open mouth image appeared first in Bacon&#x27;s &quot;Abstraction from the Human Form&quot;, in &quot;Fragment of a Crucifixion&quot;, and other works including his famous &quot;Head&quot; series.
* The Soviet Union-born photographer and artist Alexey Titarenko was inspired by and paid tribute to the Odessa Steps sequence in his series &quot;City of Shadows&quot; (1991–1993), shot near the subway station in Saint Petersburg.
* The popular culture periodical (and website) &quot;Odessa Steps Magazine&quot;, started in 2000, is named after the sequence.
* The 2011 October Revolution parade in Moscow featured a homage to the film.
* Episode 2 of Japanese animation &quot;Ergo Proxy&quot; titled &quot;Confessions of a Fellow Citizen&quot;.

==Distribution, censorship and restoration==
After its first screening, the film was not distributed in the Soviet Union and there was a danger that it would be lost among other productions. Poet Vladimir Mayakovsky intervened because his good friend, poet Nikolai Aseev, had participated in the making of the film&#x27;s intertitles. Mayakovsky&#x27;s opposing party was Sovkino&#x27;s president Konstantin Shvedchikov. He was a politician and friend of Vladimir Lenin who once hid Lenin in his home before the Revolution. Mayakovsky presented Shvedchikov with a hard demand that the film would be distributed abroad, and intimidated Shvedchikov with the fate of becoming a villain in history books. Mayakovsky&#x27;s closing sentence was &quot;Shvedchikovs come and go, but art remains. Remember that!&quot; Besides Mayakovsky many others also persuaded Shvedchikov to spread the film around the world and after constant pressure from Sovkino he eventually sent the film to Berlin. There &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot; became a huge success, and the film was again screened in Moscow.

When Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford visited Moscow in July 1926, they were full of praise for &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot;; Fairbanks helped distribute the film in the U.S., and even asked Eisenstein to go to Hollywood. In the U.S. the film premiered in New York on 5 December 1926, at the Biltmore Theatre.

The film was shown in an edited form in Germany, with some scenes of extreme violence edited out by German distributors. A written introduction by Trotsky was cut from Soviet prints after he ran afoul of Stalin. The film was banned in the United Kingdom (until 1954; it was then X-rated until 1987), France, Japan, and other countries for its revolutionary zeal.

Today the film is widely available in various DVD editions. In 2004, a three-year restoration of the film was completed. Many excised scenes of violence were restored, as well as the original written introduction by Trotsky. The previous English intertitles, which had toned down the mutinous sailors&#x27; revolutionary rhetoric, were corrected so that they would now be an accurate translation of the original Russian titles.

===Posters===

The posters for the movie &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot; created by Aleksandr Rodchenko in 1925 became prominent examples of Soviet constructivist art. One version shows a sniper sight on two scenes of Eisenstein&#x27;s movie, representing two guns of the Battleship.

Another version was created in 1926. Being part of collections of museums such as Valencia&#x27;s IVAM, shows a much clearer image. Using a central romboid figure with the Battleship on it, combines graphic design and photomontage to create an image where the Battleship is the main protagonist. The clear image contrasts with the aggressive use of painting, whereas the diagonal lines are also a recognizable trait of the work.

There is also a poster where the central figure is a sailor, with the Battleship on the central background.

==Soundtracks==

To retain its relevance as a propaganda film for each new generation, Eisenstein hoped the score would be rewritten every 20 years. The original score was composed by Edmund Meisel. A salon orchestra performed the Berlin premiere in 1926. The instruments were flute/piccolo, trumpet, trombone, harmonium, percussion and strings without viola. Meisel wrote the score in twelve days because of the late approval of film censors. As time was so short Meisel repeated sections of the score. Composer/conductor Mark-Andreas Schlingensiepen has reorchestrated the original piano score to fit the version of the film available today.

Nikolai Kryukov composed a new score in 1950 for the 25th anniversary. In 1985, Chris Jarrett composed a solo piano accompaniment for the movie. In 1986 Eric Allaman wrote an electronic score for a showing that took place at the 1986 Berlin International Film Festival. The music was commissioned by the organizers, who wanted to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the film&#x27;s German premiere. The score was played only at this premiere and has not been released on CD or DVD. Contemporary reviews were largely positive apart from negative comment because the music was electronic. Allaman also wrote an opera about Battleship Potemkin, which is musically separate from the film score.

In commercial format, on DVD for example, the film is usually accompanied by classical music added for the &quot;50th anniversary edition&quot; released in 1975. Three symphonies from Dmitri Shostakovich have been used, with No. 5, beginning and ending the film, being the most prominent. A version of the film offered by the Internet Archive has a soundtrack that also makes heavy use of the symphonies of Shostakovich, including his Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, Tenth, and Eleventh.

In 2007, Del Rey &amp; The Sun Kings also recorded this soundtrack. In an attempt to make the film relevant to the 21st century, Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe (of the Pet Shop Boys) composed a soundtrack in 2004 with the Dresden Symphonic Orchestra. Their soundtrack, released in 2005 as &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot;, premiered in September 2004 at an open-air concert in Trafalgar Square, London. There were four further live performances of the work with the Dresdner Sinfoniker in Germany in September 2005, and one at the Swan Hunter shipyard in Newcastle upon Tyne in 2006.

The avant-garde jazz ensemble Club Foot Orchestra has also re-scored the film, and performed live accompanying the film with a score by Richard Marriott, conducted by Deirdre McClure. For the 2005 restoration of the film, under the direction of Enno Patalas in collaboration with Anna Bohn, released on DVD and Blu-ray, the Deutsche Kinemathek - Museum fur Film und Fernsehen, commissioned a re-recording of the original Edmund Meisel score, performed by the Babelsberg Orchestra, conducted by Helmut Imig. In 2011 the most recent restoration was completed with an entirely new soundtrack by members of the Apskaft group. Contributing members were AER20-200, awaycaboose, Ditzky, Drn Drn, Foucault V, fydhws, Hox Vox, Lurholm, mexicanvader, Quendus, Res Band, -Soundso- and speculativism. The entire film was digitally restored to a sharper image by Gianluca Missero (who records under the name Hox Vox). The new version is available at the Internet Archive.

A new score for &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot; was composed in 2011 by Michael Nyman, and is regularly performed by the Michael Nyman Band. The Berklee Silent Film Orchestra also composed a new score for the film in 2011, and performed it live to picture at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, in Washington, D.C. A new electroacoustic score by the composers collective Edison Studio was first performed live in Naples at Cinema Astra for Scarlatti Contemporanea Festival on 25 October 2017 and published on DVD in 5.1 surround sound by Cineteca di Bologna in the &quot;L&#x27;Immagine Ritrovata&quot; series, along with a second audio track with a recording of the Meisel&#x27;s score conducted by Helmut Imig.

==Critical response==
&quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot; has received acclaim from modern critics. On review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an overall 100% approval rating based on 49 reviews, with a rating average of 9.20/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;A technical masterpiece, &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot; is Soviet cinema at its finest, and its montage editing techniques remain influential to this day.&quot; 

Since its release &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot; has often been cited as one of the finest propaganda films ever made, and is considered one of the greatest films of all time. The film was named the greatest film of all time at the Brussels World&#x27;s Fair in 1958. Similarly, in 1952, &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; magazine cited &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot; as the fourth-greatest film of all time; it was voted within the top ten in the magazine&#x27;s five subsequent decennial polls, dropping to number 11 in the 2012 poll and number 54 in 2022.

In 2007, a two-disc, restored version of the film was released on DVD. &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Richard Corliss named it one of the Top 10 DVDs of the year, ranking it at #5. It ranked #3 in &quot;Empire&quot;″s &quot;The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema&quot; in 2010. In April 2011, &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot; was re-released in UK cinemas, distributed by the British Film Institute. On its re-release, &quot;Total Film&quot; magazine gave the film a five-star review, stating: &quot;nearly 90 years on, Eisenstein&#x27;s masterpiece is still guaranteed to get the pulse racing&quot;.

Directors Orson Welles, Michael Mann and Paul Greengrass placed &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot; on their list of favorite films, and director Billy Wilder named it as his all-time favourite film.

<text>Jefferson County is the most populous county in the U.S. state of Alabama, located in the central portion of the state. As of the 2020 census, its population was 674,721. Its county seat is Birmingham. Its rapid growth as an industrial city in the 20th century, based on heavy manufacturing in steel and iron, established its dominance. Jefferson County is the central county of the Birmingham-Hoover, AL Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

Jefferson County was established on December 13, 1819, by the Alabama Legislature. It was named in honor of former President Thomas Jefferson. The county is located in the north-central portion of the state, on the southernmost edge of the Appalachian Mountains. It is in the center of the (former) iron, coal, and limestone mining belt of the Southern United States.

Most of the original settlers were migrants of English ancestry from the Carolinas. Jefferson County has a land area of about . Early county seats were established first at Carrollsville (1819 – 21), then Elyton (1821 – 73).

Founded around 1871, Birmingham was named for the industrial English city of the same name in Warwickshire. That city had long been a center of iron and steel production in Great Britain. Birmingham was formed by the merger of three towns, including Elyton. It has continued to grow by annexing neighboring towns and villages, including North Birmingham.

As Birmingham industrialized, its growth accelerated, particularly after 1890. It attracted numerous rural migrants, both black and white, for its new jobs. It also attracted European immigrants. Despite the city&#x27;s rapid growth, for decades it was underrepresented in the legislature. Legislators from rural counties kept control of the legislature and, to avoid losing power, for decades refused to reapportion the seats or redistrict congressional districts. Birmingham could not get its urban needs addressed by the legislature.

Nearby Bessemer, Alabama, located 16 miles by car to the southwest, also grew based on industrialization. It also attracted many workers. By the early decades of the 20th century, it had a majority-black population, but whites dominated politically and economically.

===Civil rights===
Racial tensions increased in the cities and state in the late 19th century as whites worked to maintain white supremacy. The white-dominated legislature passed a new constitution in 1901 that disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites, excluding them totally from the political system. While they were nominally still eligible in the mid-20th century for jury duty, they were overwhelmingly excluded by white administrators from juries into the 1950s. Economic competition among the new workers in the city also raised tensions. It was a rough environment of mill and mine workers in Birmingham and Bessemer, and the Ku Klux Klan was active in the 20th century, often with many police being members into the 1950s and 1960s.

In a study of lynchings in the South from 1877 to 1950, Jefferson County is documented as having the highest number of lynchings of any county in Alabama. White mobs committed 29 lynchings in the county, most around the turn of the century at a time of widespread political suppression of blacks in the state. Notable incidents include 1889&#x27;s lynching of George Meadows.

Even after 1950, racial violence of whites against blacks continued. In the 1950s KKK chapters bombed black-owned houses in Birmingham to discourage residents moving into new middle-class areas. In that period, the city was referred to as &quot;Bombingham&quot;.

In 1963 African Americans led a movement in the city seeking civil rights, including integration of public facilities. The Birmingham campaign was known for the violence the city police used against non-violent protesters. In the late summer, city and business officials finally agreed in 1963 to integrate public facilities and hire more African Americans. This followed the civil rights campaign, which was based at the 16th Street Baptist Church, and an economic boycott of white stores that refused to hire blacks. Whites struck again: on a Sunday in September 1963, KKK members bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church, killing four young black girls and injuring many persons. The African-American community quickly rebuilt the damaged church. They entered politics in the city, county and state after the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was passed.

===Sewer construction and bond swap controversy===
In the 1990s, the county authorized and financed a massive overhaul of the county-owned sewer system, beginning in 1996. Sewerage and water rates had increased more than 300% in the 15 years before 2011, causing severe problems for the poor in Birmingham and the county.

Costs for the project increased due to problems in the financial area. In addition, county officials, encouraged by bribes by financial services companies, made a series of risky bond-swap agreements. Two extremely controversial undertakings by county officials in the 2000s resulted in the county having debt of $4 billion. The county eventually declared bankruptcy in 2011. It was the largest municipal bankruptcy in United States history at that time. Both the sewer project and its financing were scrutinized by federal prosecutors. By 2011, &quot;six of Jefferson County&#x27;s former commissioners had been found guilty of corruption for accepting the bribes, along with 15 other officials.&quot;

The controversial interest rate swaps, initiated in 2002 and 2003 by former Commission President Larry Langford (removed in 2011 as the mayor of Birmingham after his conviction at trial), were intended to lower interest payments. But they had the opposite effect, increasing the county&#x27;s indebtedness to the point that it had to declare bankruptcy. The bond swaps were the focus of an investigation by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.

In late February 2008 Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s lowered the rating of Jefferson County bonds to &quot;junk&quot; status. The likelihood of the county filing for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection was debated in the press. In early March 2008, Moody&#x27;s followed suit and indicated that it would also review the county&#x27;s ability to meet other bond obligations. On March 7, 2008, Jefferson County failed to post $184 million collateral as required under its sewer bond agreements, thereby moving into technical default.

In February 2011, Lesley Curwen of the BBC World Service interviewed David Carrington, the newly appointed president of the County Commission, about the risk of defaulting on bonds issued to finance &quot;what could be the most expensive sewage system in history.&quot; Carrington said there was &quot;no doubt that people from Wall Street offered bribes&quot; and &quot;have to take a huge responsibility for what happened.&quot; Wall Street investment banks, including JP Morgan and others, arranged complex financial deals using swaps. The fees and penalty charges increased the cost so the county in 2011 had $3.2 billion outstanding. Carrington said one of the problems was that elected officials had welcomed scheduling with very low early payments so long as peak payments occurred after they left office.

In 2011 the SEC awarded the county $75 million in compensation in relation to a judgment of &quot;unlawful payments&quot; against JP Morgan; in addition the company was penalized by having to forfeit $647 million of future fees.

===2011 bankruptcy filing===
Jefferson County filed for bankruptcy on November 9, 2011. This action was valued at $4.2 billion, with debts of $3.14 billion relating to sewer work; it was then the most costly municipal bankruptcy ever in the United States. In 2013, it was surpassed by the Detroit bankruptcy in Michigan. The County requested Chapter 9 relief under federal statute 11 U.S.C. §921. The case was filed in the Northern District of Alabama Bankruptcy Court as case number 11-05736.

, Jefferson County had slashed expenses and reduced employment of county government workers by more than 700. The county emerged from bankruptcy in December 2013, following the approval of a bankruptcy plan by the United States bankruptcy court for the Northern District of Alabama, writing off more than $1.4 billion of the debt.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.1%) is water. It is the fifth-largest county in Alabama by land area.

The county is located within the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians, with the highest point in the county being found at Shades Mountain, at an elevation of 1,150 ft. Another significant mountain located within the county is Red Mountain, which runs to the south of downtown Birmingham and separates the city from the suburb of Homewood. Many other mountains and valleys make up the majority of the county&#x27;s diverse geography.

The county is home to the Watercress Darter National Wildlife Refuge.

The largest self-reported European ancestries in Jefferson County, Alabama are English 9.7%(64,016), &quot;American&quot; 9.6%(63,015), Irish 8.6%(56,695), German 7.2%(47,690). Many Americans whose ancestors came from Britain or Ireland identify simply as American, because their immigrant ancestors arrived so long ago, in some cases in the 17th and 18th centuries. Demographers estimate that roughly 20–23% of people in Alabama are of predominantly English and related British Isles ancestry. Researchers believe that more of the European-American population has Scots-Irish ancestry than residents identify with today. In addition, many African Americans have racially-mixed ancestry, often with some ancestors from the British Isles. Having been classified in the South as black under racial segregation, some of these families are beginning to use DNA tests to learn about and acknowledge European ancestors. Some identify as multiracial as a result.

==Government and infrastructure==
Jefferson County is one of the eight counties in Alabama with a limited-form of home rule government. A 1973 Commission had recommended that all counties be granted home rule under the state constitution, but the state legislature has refused to give up its control over local affairs.

In the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the county was underrepresented politically for decades into the 1960s because the rural-dominated state legislature refused to redistrict as population increased in urban counties. Changes to county representation in the state legislature did not take place until the state was required to incorporate the principle of one man, one vote from the US Supreme Court decision of &quot;Baker v. Carr&quot; (1964). It ruled that bicameral legislatures had to have both houses based on population districts, rather than geographic ones. The complexity of Birmingham and Jefferson County urban conditions required more local management, as it was a major industrial center. The county gained some home rule functions by 1944. It allows the county to set up a zoning system for land use, maintain the sanitary sewer, sewerage systems and highways, provide for garbage and trash disposal, and to enforce taxation (except for property taxes).

Today the county has a type of council-manager form of government. It is governed by a five-member commission that combines the legislative and executive duties for the county. The Commissioners are elected from single-member districts. Each county commissioner represents one of the five districts in the county, apportioned roughly equally by population. By votes in the commission, the commissioners are given executive responsibilities for the various county departments, which fall under the categories of &quot;Roads and Transportation&quot;, &quot;Community Development&quot;, &quot;Environmental Services&quot;, &quot;Health and Human Services&quot;, &quot;Technology and Land Development&quot;, and &quot;Finance and General Services&quot;. The County Commission elects a President from among its members, who serves as the chairperson of all County Commission meetings, and who has additional executive duties.

The Commission hires a county manager, who oversees and directs daily operations of county departments.

===Taxation===
Sales tax on many items within the county can be as high as 12%. The County Commission approved an educational sales tax by a 3–2 vote in October 2004. This was implemented In January 2005, as a 1% sales tax to support funding for construction of needed education facilities. This additional 1% has resulted in some county municipalities, such as Fairfield, to have sales tax rates as high as 10%, while other municipalities and incorporated communities had an increase in their total sales tax rate from 8% to 9%. The state of Alabama sales tax was 4% at the time and Jefferson County&#x27;s was 2% in total. Some municipal sales taxes reach 4%.

On March 16, 2011, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that Jefferson County&#x27;s 2009 occupational tax law was passed unconstitutionally. This decision dealt a devastating financial blow to a county considering bankruptcy.

===Law===
Jefferson County is served by the Jefferson County Sheriff&#x27;s Department. The County Sheriff is chosen by the eligible voters in an at large election. The Sheriff&#x27;s Department fields about 175 deputy sheriffs who patrol the unincorporated areas of the county, and also all municipalities that do not have their own police departments. The Sheriff&#x27;s Department has two county jails, one in Birmingham and one in Bessemer, which are used to detain suspects awaiting trial (who cannot afford to post bail), and convicted criminals serving sentences less than one year in length.

Two judicial courthouses are located in Jefferson County, a situation dating to when the state legislature was preparing to split off a portion of Jefferson County to create a new county, centered around Bessemer. The city is located about 16 miles to the southwest by car. The split did not take place because the area of the proposed county would have been smaller than the minimum of 500 square miles set forth in the state constitution. The additional county courthouse and some parallel functions remain in service. The main courthouse is in Birmingham and the second one is located in Bessemer. Certain elected county officials maintain offices in the Bessemer annex, such as the Assistant Tax Collector, the Assistant Tax Assessor, and the Assistant District Attorney.

===Prisons===
The local jails have a long history of abuse of prisoners. One former jailer, who started work for the Jefferson County Convict Department in 1919, described beatings, the administration of laxatives, and confinement in a tiny two-by-three-foot cell, as well as beatings with rubber hoses. He said, &quot;You can work a man pretty good with a piece of pipe and never mark him.&quot; Well into the 1950s, prisoners were regularly beaten and tortured by police to extract coerced &quot;confessions&quot; to crimes.

In mid-2015, the Department of Justice announced an investigation of the conditions imposed on juveniles in the county jail. It said that young people with mental illnesses were locked in solitary confinement for months at a time. Others were housed with adult prisoners who raped them.

The Alabama Department of Corrections operates the William E. Donaldson Correctional Facility, a prison for men, in unincorporated Jefferson County near Bessemer. The prison includes one of the two Alabama death rows for men.

==Religion==
In 2010 statistics, the largest religious group in Jefferson County was the SBC Baptists with 185,650 members in 272 congregations, followed by 69,878 non-denominational adherents with 170 congregations, 67,313 NBC Baptists with 117 congregations, 55,083 Catholics in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Birmingham in Alabama with 32 parishes, 43,422 UMC Methodists with 86 congregations, 15,899 CoG–Cleveland, Tennessee Pentecostals with 45 congregations, 14,025 TEC Episcopalians with 17 congregations, 11,267 CoC Christians with 69 congregations, 11,171 CoGiC Pentecostals with 16 congregations, and 9,472 AME Methodists with 42 congregations. Altogether, 83.9% of the population was claimed as members by religious congregations, although members of historically African-American denominations were underrepresented due to incomplete information. In 2014, Jefferson County had 714 religious organizations, the 15th most out of all US counties.

==Education==
School districts in the county include:

*Bessemer City School District
*Birmingham City School District
*Fairfield City School District
*Homewood City School District
*Hoover City School District
*Leeds City School District
*Jefferson County School District
*Midfield City School District
*Mountain Brook City School District
*Tarrant City School District
*Trussville City School District
*Vestavia Hills City School District
===History of education===
As a reaction to the US Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling in &quot;Brown v Board of Education&quot; in 1954, that segregated public schools were unconstitutional, both state and local officials took steps to preserve &quot;de facto&quot; educational segregation. As late as 1965, schools in the county were still totally segregated. In 1969, public schools in the county became fully integrated.

Except for cities such as Birmingham, that have established their own local school districts, all parts of Jefferson County are served by the Jefferson County Board of Education. Parts within Birmingham are served by Birmingham City Schools.

Beginning in 1959, more wealthy towns, with predominately white populations, began to form their own school systems. Critics allege this served to stymie integration and financially starve schools that served mostly black populations. Cities in the county that have established their own school systems are Gardendale, Bessemer, Fairfield, Midfield, Trussville, Homewood, Leeds, Hoover, Vestavia Hills, Tarrant, and Mountain Brook. The pattern of residential and economic segregation has occurred in many parts of the country, including economic segregation of poorer whites.

==Politics==
Like most urban counties, Jefferson County leans Democratic. It remains the only county in Alabama outside of the Black Belt that votes Democratic. In 2020, Joe Biden received 55.7% of the vote in Jefferson County, the best performance by a Democrat since Franklin Roosevelt in 1944. Before Obama&#x27;s victory, Jefferson County had last supported the official Democratic candidate for president in 1952, and only once since 1944.

<doc id="77871" wikidata="Q190097" url="?curid=77871" title="Carinus">
<text>Marcus Aurelius Carinus (died 285) was Roman Emperor from 283 to 285. The eldest son of the Emperor Carus, he was first appointed &quot;Caesar&quot; in late 282, then given the title of &quot;Augustus&quot; in early 283, and made co-emperor of the western part of the Empire by his father. Official accounts of his character and career, which portray him as dissolute and incompetent, have been filtered through the propaganda of his successful opponent Diocletian.

==Reign==
After the death of Emperor Probus in a spontaneous mutiny by the army in 282, his praetorian prefect, Carus, ascended to the throne. When he left for the Persian war, he elevated his two sons to the title of Caesar. The elder, Carinus, was left to manage the affairs of the West in his absence, and was later elevated to the rank of Augustus, while the younger, Numerian, accompanied his father to the East.

Carinus acquitted himself well, at least at first, showing some merit in suppressing unrest in Gaul and against the Quadi, but the young emperor soon left the defence of the Upper Rhine to his legates and returned to Rome, where the surviving accounts, which demonise him, claim he indulged in all manner of extravagance and excess. He is said to have married and divorced nine different women during his short reign in Rome and to have made his private life notorious. He is said to have persecuted many who he felt had treated him with insufficient respect before his elevation, to have alienated the Senate by his open dislike and contempt, and to have prostituted the imperial dignity with the various low entertainments he introduced at court.

When Carus heard of his son&#x27;s behaviour in the capital, he declared his intention of removing him from office and replacing him with Constantius Chlorus, who was already known for his ability and virtue. Carus, however, died soon afterwards in the midst of the Persian War, and his two sons jointly succeeded him.

On his return to Rome, Carinus organised the annual games, the &quot;Ludi Romani&quot;, on an unprecedented scale. At the same time, Numerian was forced to abandon his father&#x27;s ambitious campaign in the east by the soldiers, who were superstitious about Carus&#x27; death, supposedly caused by a bolt of lightning.

Numerian led his army back to Rome, where a triumph awaited him, leaving the Persians astonished at the inexplicable retreat of a victorious army. Numerian&#x27;s health, however, was broken by the climate, and unable to bear the heat of the sun, he was carried on a covered litter on the march. Arrius Aper, the praetorian prefect, took charge in his name, but his ambitious temper aroused the troops&#x27; suspicions. At Heraclea in Thrace, they broke into the imperial tent and found Numerian dead. Diocletian, commander of the bodyguard, confirmed that Numerian had been murdered by the Praefect, and after executing the Praefect, he was proclaimed Emperor by the soldiers.

Carinus immediately left Rome and headed east to meet Diocletian. On his way through Pannonia he overthrew the usurper Sabinus Julianus and in July 285 met Diocletian&#x27;s army at the Battle of the Margus River (modern Morava River) in Moesia.

=== Death in 285 ===

Historians disagree about what happened next. According to one account, his troops prevailed at the Battle of the Margus River, but Carinus was murdered by a tribune whose wife he had seduced. Another account describes the battle as a complete victory for Diocletian and claims that Carinus&#x27; army deserted him. This account may be supported by the fact that Diocletian kept Carinus&#x27; Praetorian Guard commander, Titus Claudius Aurelius Aristobulus, in service.

=== Character ===
Carinus has the reputation of being one of the worst Roman emperors. This infamy may have been encouraged by Diocletian. The unreliable &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; has Carinus marrying nine wives. After his death, Carinus&#x27; memory was officially condemned in the Roman procedure known as &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot;. His name and that of his wife were erased from inscriptions.

<text>Henry County is a county in the southeastern part of the U.S. state of Alabama. As of the 2020 census, its population was 17,146. Its county seat is Abbeville. The county was named for Patrick Henry, the orator and Governor of Virginia.

Henry County is part of the Dothan, Alabama metropolitan area.

==History==
The area that includes Henry County had historically been occupied by people of the Lower Creek Confederacy, who now prefer to be known as the Muscogee. It was occupied for thousands of years before that by varying cultures of indigenous peoples who settled primarily along the waterways.

This area was colonized by various European powers, including France and Spain. After Great Britain defeated France in the Seven Years&#x27; War, it took over this area. Between 1763 and 1783, the area that is now Henry County, Alabama was under the jurisdiction of the colony of British West Florida. The United States acquired it from Britain after gaining independence in the American Revolutionary War.

After 1814, the territorial settlers developed Franklin as the first European-American settlement in Muscogee/Creek territory. The former river port served Abbeville on the Chattahoochee River. Much of Henry County was within the Alabama wiregrass region.

Henry County was established on December 13, 1819, by the Alabama Territorial Legislature. The area was ceded by the Creek Indian Nation in 1814 under the Treaty of Fort Jackson. Henry County was formed before Alabama was organized as a state. Abbeville was designated as the county seat in 1833.

When the county was formed December 1819, it was the largest county by area within Alabama and encompassed a vast land area that now includes the Southeast Alabama Wiregrass Region and beyond. As population increased in the region, areas of it were taken to organize the present counties of Barbour, Coffee, Covington, Crenshaw, Dale, Geneva, Houston, and Pike.

Timeline:

* December 7, 1821 - The first two counties created, in part, from Old Henry were Covington and Pike counties.
* December 29, 1824 - The third county was Dale which was carved, in whole, from Old Henry.
* December 18, 1832 - The fourth county to be created was Barbour County which was formed, in part, from Pike County. When Barbour County was created, Henry County gained a small parcel of land from the White Oak Creek area.
* December 29, 1841 - The fifth county to be created was Coffee County, which was formed in part from Dale County.
* December 6, 1866 - The sixth was Bullock County, which was created with the southern tip of the county indirectly coming from Old Henry.
* December 24, 1866 - The seventh county to be created was Crenshaw County which was formed, in part, from Coffee, Covington and Pike counties.
* December 28, 1868 - The eighth county to be created was Geneva County which was formed, in part, from Henry, Dale and Coffee counties.
* February 9, 1903 - The last county was Houston County; 72% of its land area was carved from Henry. The balance came from Dale and Geneva counties.

After Houston County was formed in 1903, Henry County had become the smallest in geographic area.

This rural county was developed for agriculture, and planters held many slaves. After Reconstruction, conservative Democratic Party whites regained power in the state legislature and passed Jim Crow laws to suppress African Americans. They also used intimidation and violence to discourage voting, as the freedmen allied with the Republican Party, which they credited with achieving their emancipation and granting of the franchise.

From 1877 to 1950, whites lynched 13 African Americans in the county, most in the decades on either side of the turn of the 20th century. Henry County is among the 805 counties where lynchings took place that is memorialized in the new National Memorial for Peace and Justice, which opened in April 2018 in Montgomery, Alabama.

Mechanization and other changes resulted in population losses, especially from 1940 to 1970, as many African Americans left in the Great Migration, seeking to escape the oppression of Jim Crow and gain work in northern, midwestern and western industrial cities.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.2%) is water. The county is located in the Wiregrass region of southeast Alabama.

It is the fourth-smallest county in Alabama by total area.

==Government==
Henry County is a predominately Republican county. The last Democratic presidential candidate to carry the county was favorite son Jimmy Carter of Georgia in 1980. Bill Clinton came within 63 votes of carrying the county in 1996. The electorate has become more polarized in recent times, with Joe Biden winning less than thirty percent in 2020.

Rural conservative whites had left the Democratic Party following its support of civil rights laws and the movement in the 1960s; many disagreed with its socially liberal positions. Through the late 20th century, conservative whites shifted to the Republican Party. The political affiliations are strongly associated with ethnicity, as African Americans favor the Democratic Party but are a minority in the county.

During the long period of African-American disenfranchisement in the 20th century, the conservative whites of Henry continued their well-established tradition of voting for Democratic candidates, and kept it as part of the &quot;Solid South&quot;. They did vote for Republicans Warren G. Harding and Herbert Hoover in 1920 and 1928, respectively, giving them more than forty percent of the vote. In 1964, Barry Goldwater was the first Republican candidate to carry the county as whites began to shift their alliances.

In 1968, Henry County voted for the independent candidate, Alabama governor George Wallace, giving Republican Richard Nixon only 1.59 percent of the county&#x27;s vote.

Henry County elected Democrat Dexter Grimsley to represent it in the Alabama House of Representatives.

==History==
Houston County was established on February 9, 1903, from parts of Dale, Geneva, and Henry counties. It was named after George Smith Houston, the 24th Governor of Alabama. This area of the state was historically developed for the pine timber and turpentine industries, as well as cotton plantations. The latter, especially, depended on enslaved African Americans for labor.

Because of this history, African Americans predominated in the population until after the early 20th century, when many migrated to northern and midwestern cities for better economic opportunities and to escape Jim Crow discrimination. They were essentially disenfranchised after the turn of the 20th century because of constitutional amendments and other laws that made voter registration nearly impossible. Many poor whites were disenfranchised at the same time.
