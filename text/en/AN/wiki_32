<text>The Salic law ( or ; ), also called the was the ancient Frankish civil law code compiled around AD 500 by Clovis, the first Frankish King. The written text is in Late Latin, and contains some of the earliest known instances of Old Dutch. It remained the basis of Frankish law throughout the early Medieval period, and influenced future European legal systems. The best-known tenet of the old law is the principle of exclusion of women from inheritance of thrones, fiefs, and other property. The Salic laws were arbitrated by a committee appointed and empowered by the King of the Franks. Dozens of manuscripts dating from the sixth to eighth centuries and three emendations as late as the ninth century have survived.

Salic law provided written codification of both civil law, such as the statutes governing inheritance, and criminal law, such as the punishment for murder. Although it was originally intended as the law of the Franks, it has had a formative influence on the tradition of statute law that extended to modern history in much of Europe, especially in the German states and Austria-Hungary in Central Europe, the Low Countries in Western Europe, Balkan kingdoms in Southeastern Europe, and parts of Italy and Spain in Southern Europe. Its use of agnatic succession governed the succession of kings in kingdoms such as France and Italy.

==History of the law==
The original edition of the code was commissioned by the first king of all the Franks, Clovis I (c. 466–511), and published sometime between 507 and 511. He appointed four commissioners to research customary law that, until the publication of the Salic law, had been recorded only in the minds of designated elders, who would meet in council when their knowledge was required. Transmission was entirely oral. Salic law, therefore, reflects ancient usages and practices. To govern more effectively, having a written code was desirable for monarchs and their administrations.

For the next 300 years, the code was copied by hand, and was amended as required to add newly enacted laws, revise laws that had been amended, and delete laws that had been repealed. In contrast with printing, hand copying is an individual act by an individual copyist with ideas and a style of his own. Each of the several dozen surviving manuscripts features a unique set of errors, corrections, content, and organization. The laws are called &quot;titles&quot;, as each one has its own name, generally preceded by &quot;de&quot;, &quot;of&quot;, &quot;concerning&quot;. Different sections of titles acquired individual names, which revealed something about their provenances. Some of these dozens of names have been adopted for specific reference, often given the same designation as the overall work, &quot;lex&quot;.

===Merovingian phase===
The recension of Hendrik Kern organizes all of the manuscripts into five families according to similarity and relative chronological sequence, judged by content and dateable material in the text. Family I is the oldest, containing four manuscripts dated to the eighth and ninth centuries, but containing 65 titles believed to be copies of originals published in the sixth century. In addition, they feature the &quot;Malbergse Glossen&quot;, &quot;Malberg Glosses&quot;, marginal glosses stating the native court word for some Latin words. These are named from native &quot;malbergo&quot;, &quot;language of the court&quot;. Kern&#x27;s Family II, represented by two manuscripts, is the same as Family I, except that it contains &quot;interpolations or numerous additions, which point to a later period&quot;.

===Carolingian phase===
Family III is split into two divisions. The first, comprising three manuscripts, dated to the eighth–ninth centuries, presents an expanded text of 99 or 100 titles. The Malberg Glosses are retained. The second division, with four manuscripts, not only drops the glosses, but also &quot;bears traces of attempts to make the language more concise&quot;. A statement gives the provenance: &quot;in the 13th year of the reign of our most glorious king of the Franks, Pipin&quot;. Some of the internal documents were composed after the reign of Pepin the Short, but it is considered to be an emendation initiated by Pepin, so is termed the &quot;Pipina Recensio&quot;.

Family IV also has two divisions – the first comprised 33 manuscripts; the second, one manuscript. They are characterized by the internal assignment of Latin names to various sections of different provenances. Two of the sections are dated to 768 and 778, but the emendation is believed to be dated to 798, late in the reign of Charlemagne. This edition calls itself the &quot;Lex Salica Emendata&quot;, or the &quot;Lex Reformata&quot;, or the &quot;Lex Emendata&quot;, and is clearly the result of a law code reform by Charlemagne.

By that time, Charlemagne&#x27;s Holy Roman Empire comprised most of Western Europe. He added laws of choice (free will) taken from the earlier law codes of Germanic peoples not originally part of Francia. These are numbered into the laws that were there, but they have their own, quasisectional title. All the Franks of Francia were subject to the same law code, which retained the overall title of &quot;Lex Salica&quot;. These integrated sections borrowed from other Germanic codes are the &quot;Lex Ribuariorum&quot;, later &quot;Lex Ribuaria&quot;, laws adopted from the Ripuarian Franks, who, before Clovis, had been independent. The &quot;Lex Alamannorum&quot; took laws from the Alamanni, then subject to the Franks. Under the Franks, they were governed by Frankish law, not their own. The inclusion of some of their law as part of the Salic law must have served as a palliative. Charlemagne goes back even earlier to the &quot;Lex Suauorum&quot;, the ancient code of the Suebi preceding the Alemanni.

==Malberg glosses==
The Salic law code contains the &quot;Malberg glosses&quot; (German or ; despite the name, they aren&#x27;t glosses in the proper sense), several deformed Old Frankish, or for some Dutch scholars Old Dutch, words and what is likely the earliest surviving full sentence in the language:

:* Old Dutch and Early Modern and earlier versions of English used the second-person singular pronouns, such as &quot;thou&quot; and &quot;thee&quot;.
:** A &quot;lito&quot; was a form of serf in the feudal system, a half-free farmer, connected to the lord&#x27;s land, but not owned by that lord. In contrast, a slave was fully owned by the lord.

This sentence is also given as the following:
==Some tenets of the law==
These laws and their interpretations give an insight into Frankish society. The criminal laws established damages to be paid and fines levied in recompense for injuries to persons and damage to goods, theft, and unprovoked insults. One-third of the fine paid court costs. Judicial interpretation was by a jury of peers.

The civil law establishes that an individual person is legally unprotected if he or she does not belong to a family. The rights of family members were defined; for example, the equal division of land among all living male heirs, in contrast to primogeniture.

===Agnatic succession===
One tenet of the civil law is agnatic succession, explicitly excluding females from the inheritance of a throne or fief. Indeed, &quot;Salic law&quot; has often been used simply as a synonym for agnatic succession, but the importance of Salic law extends beyond the rules of inheritance, as it is a direct ancestor of the systems of law in use in many parts of continental Europe today.

Salic law regulates succession according to sex. &quot;Agnatic succession&quot; means succession to the throne or fief going to an agnate of the predecessor – for example, a brother, a son, or nearest male relative through the male line, including collateral agnate branches, for example very distant cousins. Chief forms are agnatic seniority and agnatic primogeniture. The latter, which has been the most usual, means succession going to the eldest son of the monarch; if the monarch had no sons, the throne would pass to the nearest male relative in the male line.

===Female inheritance===

Concerning the inheritance of land, Salic law said:

or, another transcript:

The law merely prohibited women from inheriting ancestral &quot;Salic land&quot;; this prohibition did not apply to other property (such as personal property); and under Chilperic I sometime around the year 570, the law was actually amended to permit inheritance of land by a daughter if a man had no surviving sons (This amendment, depending on how it is applied and interpreted, offers the basis for either Semi-Salic succession or male-preferred primogeniture, or both).

The wording of the law, as well as common usage in those days and centuries afterwards, seems to support an interpretation that inheritance is divided between brothers, and if it is intended to govern succession, it can be interpreted to mandate agnatic seniority, not direct primogeniture. In its use by continental hereditary monarchies since the 15th century, aiming at agnatic succession, the Salic law is regarded as excluding all females from the succession, and prohibiting the transfer of succession rights through any woman. At least two systems of hereditary succession are direct and full applications of the Salic Law: agnatic seniority and agnatic primogeniture.

The Semi-Salic version of succession order stipulates that firstly all-male descendance is applied, including all collateral male lines, but if all such lines are extinct, then the closest female agnate (such as a daughter) of the last male holder of the property inherits, and after her, her own male heirs according to the Salic order. In other words, the female closest to the last incumbent is &quot;regarded as a male&quot; for the purposes of inheritance and succession. This has the effect of following the closest extant blood line (at least in the first instance) and not involving any more distant relatives. The closest female relative might be a child of a relatively junior branch of the whole dynasty, but still inherits due to her position in the male line, due to the longevity of her own branch; any existing senior female lines come behind that of the closest female.

From the Middle Ages, another system of succession, known as cognatic male primogeniture, actually fulfills apparent stipulations of the original Salic law; succession is allowed also through female lines, but excludes the females themselves in favour of their sons. For example, a grandfather, without sons, is succeeded by a son of his daughter, when the daughter in question is still alive. Or an uncle, with no children of his own, is succeeded by a son of his sister, when the sister in question is still alive. This fulfils the Salic condition of &quot;no land comes to a woman, but the land comes to the male sex&quot;. This can be called a &quot;quasi-Salic&quot; system of succession and it should be classified as primogenitural, cognatic, and male-preferred.

==Applications of the succession and inheritance laws==

===In France===
The Merovingian kings divided their realm equally among all living sons, leading to much conflict and fratricide among the rival heirs. The Carolingians did likewise, but they also possessed the imperial dignity, which was indivisible and passed to only one person at a time. Primogeniture, or the preference for the eldest line in the transmission of inheritance, eventually emerged in France, under the Capetian kings. The early Capetians had only one heir, the eldest son, whom they crowned during their lifetimes. Instead of an equal portion of the inheritance, the younger sons of the Capetian kings received an appanage, which is a feudal territory under the suzerainty of the king. Feudal law allowed the transmission of fiefs to daughters in default of sons, which was also the case for the early appanages. Whether feudal law also applied to the French throne, no one knew, until 1316.

====The succession in 1316====
For a remarkably long period, from the inception of the Capetian dynasty in 987 until the death of Louis X in 1316, the eldest living son of the King of France succeeded to the throne upon his demise. No prior occasion existed to demonstrate whether or not females were excluded from the succession to the crown. Louis X died without a son, but left his wife pregnant. The king&#x27;s brother, Philip, Count of Poitiers, became regent. Philip prepared for the contingencies with Odo IV, Duke of Burgundy, maternal uncle of Louis X&#x27;s daughter and prospective heiress, Joan. If the unborn child were male, he would succeed to the French throne as king; if female, Philip would maintain the regency until the daughters of Louis X reached their majority. The opportunity remained for either daughter to succeed to the French throne.

The unborn child proved to be male, John I, to the relief of the kingdom, but the infant lived for only a few days. Philip saw his chance and broke the agreement with the Duke of Burgundy by having himself anointed at Reims in January 1317 as Philip V of France. Agnes of France, daughter of Louis IX, mother of the Duke of Burgundy, and maternal grandmother of the Princess Joan, considered it a usurpation and demanded an assembly of the peers, which Philip V accepted.

An assembly of prelates, lords, the bourgeois of Paris, and doctors of the university, known as the Estates-General of 1317, gathered in February. Philip V asked them to write an argument justifying his right to the throne of France. These &quot;general statements&quot; agreed in declaring that &quot;Women do not succeed in the kingdom of France&quot;, formalizing Philip&#x27;s usurpation and the impossibility for a woman to ascend the throne of France, a principle that remains in force to this day. The Salic law, at the time, was not yet invoked; the arguments put forward in favor of Philip V relied only on the degree of proximity of Philip V with Louis X. Philip had the support of the nobility and had the resources for his ambitions.

Philip won over the Duke of Burgundy by giving him his daughter, also named Joan, in marriage, with the counties of Artois and Burgundy as her eventual inheritance. On March 27, 1317, a treaty was signed at Laon between the Duke of Burgundy and Philip V, wherein Joan renounced her right to the throne of France.

====The succession in 1328====
Philip, too, died without a son, and his brother Charles succeeded him as Charles IV unopposed. Charles, too, died without a son, but also left his wife pregnant. It was another succession crisis, the same as that in 1316; it was necessary both to prepare for a possible regency (and choose a regent) and prepare for a possible succession to the throne. At this point, it had been accepted that women could not claim the crown of France (without any written rule stipulating it yet).

Under the application of the agnatic principle, the following were excluded:
*The daughters of Louis X, Philip V and Charles IV, including the possible unborn daughter of the pregnant Queen Jeanne d&#x27;Évreux
*Isabella of France, sister of Louis X, Philip V, and Charles IV, wife of King Edward II of England

The widow of Charles IV gave birth to a daughter. Isabella of France, sister of Charles IV, claimed the throne for her son, Edward III of England. The French rejected the claim, noting that &quot;Women cannot transmit a right which they do not possess&quot;, a corollary to the succession principle in 1316. The regent, Philip of Valois, became Philip VI of France in 1328. Philip became king without serious opposition, until his attempt to confiscate Gascony in 1337 made Edward III press his claim to the French throne.

====Emergence of the Salic law====
As far as can be ascertained, Salic law was not explicitly mentioned either in 1316 or 1328. It had been forgotten in the feudal era, and the assertion that the French crown can only be transmitted to and through males made it unique and exalted in the eyes of the French. In 1358 the monk Richard Lescot invoked it to dispute the claim of Charles II of Navarre to the French crown, an argument that would later be echoed by other jurists in defence of the Valois dynasty.

In its origin, therefore, the agnatic principle was limited to the succession to the crown of France. Prior to the Valois succession, Capetian kings granted appanages to their younger sons and brothers, which could pass to male and female heirs. The appanages given to the Valois princes, though, in imitation of the succession law of the monarchy that gave them, limited their transmission to males. Another Capetian lineage, the Montfort of Brittany, claimed male succession in the Duchy of Brittany. In this they were supported by the King of England, while their rivals who claimed the traditional female succession in Brittany were supported by the King of France. The Montforts eventually won the duchy by warfare, but had to recognize the suzerainty of the King of France.

This law was by no means intended to cover all matters of inheritance – for example, not the inheritance of movables — only to lands considered &quot;Salic&quot; – and debate remains as to the legal definition of this word, although it is generally accepted to refer to lands in the royal fisc. Only several hundred years later, under the direct Capetian kings of France and their English contemporaries who held lands in France, did Salic law become a rationale for enforcing or debating succession.

Shakespeare says that Charles VI rejected Henry V&#x27;s claim to the French throne on the basis of Salic law&#x27;s inheritance rules, leading to the Battle of Agincourt. In fact, the conflict between Salic and English law was a justification for many overlapping claims between the French and English monarchs over the French throne.

More than a century later, during the French wars of religion, Philip II of Spain attempted to claim the French crown for his daughter Isabella Clara Eugenia, born of his third wife, Elisabeth of Valois in order to prevent the Huguenot candidate Henry of Navarre from becoming king. Philip&#x27;s agents were instructed to &quot;insinuate cleverly&quot; that the Salic law was a &quot;pure invention&quot;. Even if the &quot;Salic law&quot; did not really apply to the throne of France, though, the very principle of agnatic succession had become a cornerstone of the French royal succession; they had upheld it in the Hundred Years&#x27; War with the English, and it had produced their kings for more than two centuries. The eventual recognition of Henry of Navarre as King Henry IV of France following his conversion to Catholicism, the first of the Bourbon kings, further solidified the agnatic principle in France.

Although no reference was made to the Salic law, the imperial constitutions of the Bonapartist First French Empire and Second French Empire continued to exclude women from the succession to the throne. In the lands that Napoleon Bonaparte conquered, Salic law was adopted, including the Kingdom of Westphalia, the Kingdom of Holland, and under Napoleonic influence, Sweden under the House of Bernadotte.

===Other European applications===

Several military conflicts in European history have stemmed from the application of, or disregard for, Salic law. The Carlist Wars occurred in Spain over the question of whether the heir to the throne should be a female or a male relative. The War of the Austrian Succession was triggered by the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713, in which Charles VI of Austria, who himself had inherited the Austrian patrimony over his nieces as a result of Salic law, attempted to ensure the inheritance directly to his own daughter Maria Theresa of Austria, which was an example of an operation of quasi-Salic law.

In the modern Kingdom of Italy, under the House of Savoy, succession to the throne was regulated by Salic law.

The British and the Hanoverian thrones separated after the death of King William IV of the United Kingdom and of Hanover in 1837 because Hanover practiced quasi-Salic law, unlike Britain. King William&#x27;s niece, Victoria, ascended to the British throne, but the Hanover throne went to William&#x27;s brother Ernest, Duke of Cumberland.

Salic law was also an important issue in the Schleswig-Holstein Question and played a day-to-day role in the inheritance and marriage decisions of common princedoms of the German states, such as Saxe-Weimar, to cite a representative example. European nobility would have confronted Salic issues at every turn in the practice of diplomacy, particularly when they negotiated marriages, since the entire male line had to be extinguished for a land title to pass (by marriage) &quot;to a female&#x27;s husband&quot;. Women rulers were anathema in the German states well into the modern era.

In a similar way, the thrones of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg were separated in 1890, with the succession of Princess Wilhelmina as the first Queen regnant of the Netherlands. As a remnant of Salic law, the office of the reigning monarch of the Netherlands is always formally known as &quot;King&quot;, though her title may be &quot;Queen&quot;. Luxembourg passed to the House of Orange-Nassau&#x27;s distantly related agnates, the House of Nassau-Weilburg, but that house also faced extinction in the male line less than two decades later. With no other male-line agnates in the remaining branches of the House of Nassau, Grand Duke William IV adopted a quasi-Salic law of succession to allow him to be succeeded by his daughters.

==Literary references==
*Shakespeare uses the Salic law as a plot device in &quot;Henry V&quot;, saying it was upheld by the French to bar Henry V&#x27;s claiming the French throne. &quot;Henry V&quot; begins with the Archbishop of Canterbury being asked if the claim might be upheld despite the Salic law. The archbishop replies, &quot;That the &quot;land Salique&quot; is in Germany, between the floods of Sala and of Elbe&quot;, implying that the law is German, not French. The archbishop&#x27;s justification for Henry&#x27;s claim, which Shakespeare intentionally renders obtuse and verbose (for comedic, as well as politically expedient reasons) is also erroneous, as the Salian Franks settled along the lower Rhine and Scheldt, which today is for the most part in the Flemish Region.
*In the novel &quot;Royal Flash&quot;, by George MacDonald Fraser, the hero, Harry Flashman, on his marriage, is presented with the royal consort&#x27;s portion of the crown jewels, and &quot;The Duchess did rather better&quot;; the character, feeling hard done-by, thinks, &quot;It struck me then, and it strikes me now, that the Salic law was a damned sound idea&quot;.
*In his novel &quot;Waverley&quot;, Sir Walter Scott quotes &quot;Salique Law&quot; when discussing the protagonist&#x27;s prior requests for a horse and guide to take him to Edinburgh.

<text>The 2004 Summer Olympics (), officially the Games of the XXVIII Olympiad (), and officially branded as Athens 2004 (), were an international multi-sport event held from 13 to 29 August 2004 in Athens, Greece.

The Games saw 10,625 athletes compete, some 600 more than expected, accompanied by 5,501 team officials from 201 countries, with 301 medal events in 28 different sports. The 2004 Games marked the first time since the 1996 Summer Olympics that all countries with a National Olympic Committee were in attendance, and also marked the first time Athens hosted the Games since their first modern incarnation in 1896 as well as the return of the Olympic games to its birthplace. Athens became the fourth city to host the Summer Olympic Games on two occasions (together with Paris, London and Los Angeles). A new medal obverse was introduced at these Games, replacing the design by Giuseppe Cassioli that had been used since 1928. The new design features the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens rectifying the long-running mistake of using a depiction of the Roman Colosseum rather than a Greek venue.

The 2004 Olympic Games were hailed as &quot;unforgettable dream games&quot; by then-IOC President Jacques Rogge, and left Athens with a significantly improved infrastructure, including a new airport, ring road and subway system. There has been debate (mostly in popular media) regarding the cost of the Games and their possible contribution to the 2010–18 Greek government-debt crisis, although there is little or no evidence supporting this claim. The 2004 Games were generally deemed to be a success, with the rising standard of competition amongst nations across the world. The final medal tally was led by the United States, followed by China and Russia with host nation Greece in 15th place. Several world and Olympic records were also broken during these Games. 
Chile, Chinese Taipei, Dominican Republic, Georgia and Israel won their first Olympic gold medals. Eritrea and Paraguay won their first Olympic medals. 
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) won both their first Olympic medal and gold medal in this event.

==Host city selection==

Athens was chosen as the host city during the 106th IOC Session held in Lausanne, Switzerland on 5 September 1997. The Greek capital had lost its bid to organize the 1996 Summer Olympics to the American city of Atlanta nearly seven years before, during the 96th IOC Session in Tokyo, Japan on 18 September 1990. Under the direction of Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, Athens pursued another bid, this time for the right to host the Summer Olympics in 2004. The success of Athens in securing the 2004 Games was based largely on the bid&#x27;s appeal to human values, the history of the Games from ancient age and modern age and the emphasis that Athens is placed at the pivotal role that Greece and Athens could play in promoting the Modern Olympism and the Olympic Movement. Unlike the 1996 bid that was seen arrogant when the city was bidding, the 2004 bid was lauded for its low scale, humility, honest and earnestness, its focused message, and a more real and detailed bid concept.

During the unsuccessful 1996 bid, concerns and criticisms were raised – primarily regarding critical subjects about the city&#x27;s infrastructural readiness, its air pollution, its budget and politicization of the Games&#x27; events and their preparations. The subsequent successful organization of other events such as the 1991 Mediterranean Games, the 1994 FIVB Volleyball Men&#x27;s World Championship, 1994 World Fencing Championships and the successful 1997 World Championships in Athletics, one month before the Olympic host city election was crucial in allaying lingering fears and concerns among the sporting community and some IOC members about the Greek ability to host international sporting events. Another factor that contributed to the Greek capital&#x27;s selection was a growing sentiment among some IOC members to restore some original values of the Olympics to the Modern Games, a component which they felt was lost during the 1996 Summer Olympics.

After leading all voting rounds, Athens easily defeated Rome in the fifth and final vote. Cape Town, Stockholm, and Buenos Aires (the latter won the rights to host the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics in 2013), the three other cities that made the IOC shortlist, were eliminated in prior rounds of voting. Six other cities submitted applications, but their bids were dropped by the IOC in 1996. These cities were Istanbul, Lille, Rio de Janeiro (the latter won the rights to host the 2016 Summer Olympics in 2009), San Juan, Seville, and Saint Petersburg.

==Development and preparation==

=== Costs ===
The 2004 Summer Olympic Games cost the Government of Greece near €9 billion to stage. 
The Athens 2004 Organizing Committee (ATHOC), responsible for the preparation and organisation of the Games, concluded its operations as a company in 2005 with a surplus of €130.6 million. The State&#x27;s contribution to the total ATHOC budget was 8% of its expenditure against an originally anticipated 14%. The overall revenue of ATHOC, including income from tickets, sponsors, broadcasting rights, merchandise sales etc., totalled near €2.1 billion. The largest percentage of that income (38%) came from media rights. According to the cost-benefit evaluation of the impact of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games presented to the Greek Parliament in January 2013 by the Minister of Finance Mr. Giannis Stournaras, the overall net economic benefit for Greece was positive.

The Greek Ministry of Finance reported in 2013 that the expenses of the Greek state for the Athens 2004 Olympic and Paralympic Games, including both infrastructure and organizational costs, reached the amount of €8.5 billion. The same report further explains that €2 billion of this amount was covered by the revenue of the ATHOC (from tickets, sponsors, broadcasting rights, merchandise sales etc.) and that another €2 billion was directly invested in upgrading hospitals and preserving archaeological sites.
Therefore, the net infrastructure costs related to the preparation of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games was €4.5 billion, substantially lower than the reported estimates, and mainly included long-standing fixed asset investments in numerous municipal and transport infrastructures.

On the revenue side, the same report estimates that incremental tax revenues of approximately €3.5 billion arose from the increased activities caused by the Athens 2004 Olympic Games during the period 2000 to 2004. These tax revenues were paid directly to the Greek state specifically in the form of incremental social security contributions, income taxes and VAT tax paid by all the companies, professionals, and service providers that were directly involved with the Olympic Games. Moreover, it is reported that the Athens 2004 Olympic Games have had a great economic growth impact on the Greek economy, in the words of the Greek Minister of Finance, is that &quot;as a result from the cost-benefit analysis, we reach the conclusion that there has been a net economic benefit from the Olympic Games&quot;.

===Comparison to other Olympic Games===

Cost per sporting event for Athens 2004 was US$9.8 million. This compares with US$14.9 million for Rio 2016, US$49.5 million for London 2012, and US$22.5 million for Beijing 2008. Average cost per event for the Summer Games since 1960 is US$19.9 million.

Cost per athlete for Athens 2004 was US$0.3 million. This compares with US$0.4 million for Rio 2016, US$1.4 million for London 2012, and US$0.6 million for Beijing 2008. Average cost per athlete for the Summer Games since 1960 is US$0.6 million.

Cost overrun for Athens 2004 was 49%, measured in real terms from the bid to host the Games. This compares with 51% for Rio 2016 and 76% for London 2012. Average cost overrun for the Summer Games since 1960 is 176%.

===Construction===

By late March 2004, some Olympic projects were still behind schedule, and Greek authorities announced that a roof it had initially proposed as an optional, non-vital addition to the Aquatics Center would no longer be built. The main Olympic Stadium, the designated facility for the opening and closing ceremonies, was completed only two months before the Games opened. This stadium was completed with a retractable glass roof designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava. The same architect also designed the Velodrome and other facilities.

Infrastructure, such as the tram line linking venues in southern Athens with the city centre, and numerous venues were considerably behind schedule just two months before the start of the Games. The subsequent pace of preparation, however, made the rush to finish the Athens venues one of the tightest in Olympics history. The Greeks, unperturbed, maintained that they would make it all along. By July/August 2004, all venues were delivered: in August, the Olympic Stadium was officially completed and opened, joined or preceded by the official completion and openings of other venues within the Athens Olympic Sports Complex (OAKA), and the sports complexes in Faliro and Helliniko.

Late July and early August witnessed the Athens Tram become operational, and this system provided additional connections to those already existing between Athens city centre and its waterfront communities along the Saronic Gulf. These communities included the port city of Piraeus, Agios Kosmas (site of the sailing venue), Helliniko (the site of the old international airport which now contained the fencing venue, the canoe/kayak slalom course, the 15,000-seat Helliniko Olympic Basketball Arena, and the softball and baseball stadia), and the Faliro Coastal Zone Olympic Complex (site of the taekwondo, handball, indoor volleyball, and beach volleyball venues, as well as the newly reconstructed Karaiskaki Stadium for football). The upgrades to the Athens Ring Road were also delivered just in time, as were the expressway upgrades connecting central Athens with peripheral areas such as Markopoulo (site of the shooting and equestrian venues), the newly constructed Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport, Schinias (site of the rowing venue), Maroussi (site of the OAKA), Parnitha (site of the Olympic Village), Galatsi (site of the rhythmic gymnastics and table tennis venue), and Vouliagmeni (site of the triathlon venue). The upgrades to the Athens Metro were also completed, and the new lines became operational by mid-summer.

EMI released &quot;Unity&quot;, the official pop album of the Athens Olympics, in the leadup to the Olympics. It features contributions from Sting, Lenny Kravitz, Moby, Destiny&#x27;s Child, and Avril Lavigne. EMI has pledged to donate US$180,000 from the album to UNICEF&#x27;s HIV/AIDS program in Sub-Saharan Africa.

At least 14 people died during the work on the facilities. Most of these people were not from Greece.

Before the Games, Greek hotel staff staged a series of one-day strikes over wage disputes. They had been asking for a significant raise for the period covering the event being staged. Paramedics and ambulance drivers also protested. They claimed to have the right to the same Olympic bonuses promised to their security force counterparts.

==Torch relay==


The lighting ceremony of the Olympic flame took place on 25 March 2004 in Ancient Olympia. For the first time ever, the flame travelled around the world in a relay to various Summer Olympic host cities (past and future) and other large cities, before returning to Greece.

==Mascots==
Mascots have been a tradition at the Olympic Games since the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble, France. The 2004 Olympics had two official mascots: &quot;Athena&quot; and &quot;Phevos&quot; (Greek pronunciation: Athina and Fivos). The sister and brother were named after Athena, the goddess of wisdom, strategy and Phoebus, the god of light and music, respectively. They were inspired by the ancient daidala, which were toy dolls that also had religious connotations.

==Broadcasting==
Athens Olympic Broadcasting served as the host broadcaster for the Games, providing over 35,000 hours of coverage to over 300 television channels around the world. Local rights to the Games were held by ERT which devoted their three channels (ET1, NET and ET3) to more than 24 hours of Olympic coverage.

===Online coverage===
For the first time, major broadcasters were allowed to serve video coverage of the Olympics over the Internet, provided that they restricted this service geographically, to protect broadcasting contracts in other areas. The International Olympic Committee forbade Olympic athletes, as well as coaches, support personnel and other officials, from setting up specialized weblogs or other websites for covering their personal perspective of the Games. They were not allowed to post audio, video, or photos that they had taken. An exception was made if an athlete already has a personal website that was not set up specifically for the Games. NBC launched its own Olympic website, NBCOlympics.com. Focusing on the television coverage of the Games, it did provide video clips, medal standings, live results. Its main purpose, however, was to provide a schedule of what sports were on the many stations of NBC Universal. The Games were shown on television 24 hours a day, on one network or another.

==Technology==
As with any enterprise, the Organizing Committee and everyone involved with it relied heavily on technology in order to deliver a successful event. ATHOC maintained two separate data networks, one for the preparation of the Games (known as the Administrative network) and one for the Games themselves (Games Network). The technical infrastructure involved more than 11,000 computers, over 600 servers, 2,000 printers, 23,000 fixed-line telephone devices, 9,000 mobile phones, 12,000 TETRA devices, 16,000 TV and video devices and 17 Video Walls interconnected by more than 6,000 kilometers of cabling (both optical fiber and twisted pair).

This infrastructure was created and maintained to serve directly more than 150,000 ATHOC Staff, Volunteers, Olympic family members (IOC, NOCs, Federations), Partners &amp; Sponsors and Media. It also kept the information flowing for all spectators, TV viewers, Website visitors and news readers around the world, prior and during the Games. The Media Center was located inside the Zappeion which is a Greek national exhibition center.

Between June and August 2004, the technology staff worked in the Technology Operations Center (TOC) from where it could centrally monitor and manage all the devices and flow of information, as well as handle any problems that occurred during the Games. The TOC was organized in teams (e.g. Systems, Telecommunications, Information Security, Data Network, Staffing, etc.) under a TOC Director and corresponding team leaders (Shift Managers). The TOC operated on a 24x7 basis with personnel organized into 12-hour shifts.

==The Games==

===Opening ceremony===
The opening ceremony of the games, directed by choreographer Dimitris Papaioannou and produced by Jack Morton Worldwide, led by project director David Zolkwer, was held on 13 August 2004. It began with a twenty-eight (the number of the Olympiads up to then) second countdown paced by the sounds of an amplified heartbeat. As the countdown was completed, fireworks rumbled and illuminated the skies overhead. After a drum corps and bouzouki players joined in an opening march, the video screen showed images of flight, crossing southwest from Athens over the Greek countryside to ancient Olympia. Then, a single drummer in the ancient stadium joined in a drum duet with a single drummer in the main stadium in Athens, joining the original ancient Olympic Games with the modern ones in symbolism.

At the end of the drum duet, a single flaming arrow was launched from the video screen (symbolically from ancient Olympia) and into the reflecting pool, which resulted in fire erupting in the middle of the stadium creating a burning image of the Olympic rings rising from the pool. The Opening Ceremony was a pageant of traditional Greek culture and history hearkening back to its mythological beginnings. The program began as a young Greek boy sailed into the stadium on a &#x27;paper-ship&#x27; waving the host nation&#x27;s flag to aethereal music by Manos Hatzidakis and then a centaur appeared, followed by a gigantic head of a cycladic figurine which eventually broke into many pieces symbolising the Greek islands. Underneath the cycladic head was a Hellenistic representation of the human body, reflecting the concept and belief in perfection reflected in Greek art. A man was seen balancing on a hovering cube symbolising man&#x27;s eternal &#x27;split&#x27; between passion and reason followed by a couple of young lovers playfully chasing each other while the god Eros was hovering above them. There followed a very colourful float parade chronicling Greek history from the ancient Minoan civilization to modern times.
Although NBC in the United States presented the entire opening ceremony from start to finish, a topless Minoan priestess was shown only briefly, the breasts having been pixelated digitally in order to avoid controversy (as the &quot;Nipplegate&quot; incident was still fresh in viewer&#x27;s minds at the time) and potential fines by the Federal Communications Commission. Also, lower frontal nudity of men dressed as ancient Greek statues was shown in such a way that the area below the waist was cut off by the bottom of the screen. Overall, NBC&#x27;s coverage of the Olympics has been praised, and the company was awarded with 6 Emmy Awards for its coverage of the Games and technical production. Additionally, NBC televised all 28 sports in the 2004 Games, becoming the first broadcaster to do so.

Following the artistic performances, a parade of nations entered the stadium with over 10,500 athletes walking under the banners of 201 nations. The nations were arranged according to Greek alphabet making the Philippines, Finland, Fiji, Chile, and Hong Kong the last five to enter the stadium before the Greek delegation. On this occasion, in observance of the tradition that the delegation of Greece opens the parade and the host nation closes it, the Greek flag bearer opened the parade and all the Greek delegation closed it. Based on audience reaction, the emotional high point of the parade was the entrance of the delegation from Afghanistan which had been absent from the Olympics and had female competitors for the first time. The Iraqi delegation also stirred emotions. Also recognized was the symbolic unified march of athletes from North Korea and South Korea under the Korean Unification Flag. The country of Kiribati made its debut appearance at these Games and East Timor made a debut under its own flag. After the Parade of Nations, during which the Dutch DJ Tiësto provided the music, the Icelandic singer Björk performed the song &quot;Oceania&quot;, written specially for the event by her and the poet Sjón.

The opening ceremony culminated in the lighting of the Olympic cauldron by 1996 gold medalist windsurfer Nikolaos Kaklamanakis. Many key moments in the ceremony, including the lighting of the Olympic Cauldron, featured music composed and arranged by New Zealand composer John Psathas. The gigantic cauldron, which was styled after the Athens 2004 Olympic torch, pivoted down to be lit by the 35-year-old, before slowly swinging up and lifting the flame above the stadium. Following this, a fireworks display commenced to conclude the ceremony.

===Participating National Olympic Committees===
All National Olympic Committees (NOCs) except Djibouti participated in the Athens Games. Two new NOCs had been created since 2000 and made their debut at these Games (Kiribati and East Timor). Therefore, with the return of Afghanistan (who had been banned from the 2000 Summer Olympics), the number of participating nations increased from 199 to 201. Additionally, Yugoslavia had changed its name the year prior to Serbia and Montenegro and its code from YUG to SCG; the country would dissolve two years later, making this its only Olympics appearance under the new moniker. Georgia&#x27;s new flag made its debut at the Olympics by unfurling it at the opening ceremony on 13 August. It replaces the post-Soviet flag, which had been used since Lillehammer 1994.

In the table below, the number in parentheses indicates the number of participants contributed by each NOC.


* Four athletes from took part in the opening ceremony, but for reasons unknown, they did not compete at the Games.

===Number of athletes by National Olympic Committee===
10,557 athletes from 201 NOCs participated in the 2004 Summer Olympics.

===Sports===
The sports featured at the 2004 Summer Olympics are listed below. Officially there were 301 events in 28 sports as swimming, diving, synchronised swimming and water polo are classified by the IOC as disciplines within the sport of aquatics, and wheelchair racing was a demonstration sport. For the first time, the wrestling category featured women&#x27;s wrestling and in the fencing competition women competed in the sabre. American Kristin Heaston, who led off the qualifying round of women&#x27;s shot put became the first woman to compete at the ancient site of Olympia.

The demonstration sport of wheelchair racing was a joint Olympic/Paralympic event, allowing a Paralympic event to occur within the Olympics, and for the future, opening up the wheelchair race to the able-bodied. The 2004 Summer Paralympics were also held in Athens, from 17 to 28 September.

===Closing ceremony===
The Games were concluded on 29 August 2004. The closing ceremony was held at the Athens Olympic Stadium, where the Games had been opened 16 days earlier. Around 70,000 people gathered in the stadium to watch the ceremony.

The initial part of the ceremony interspersed the performances of various Greek singers, and featured traditional Greek dance performances from various regions of Greece (Crete, Thessaly, etc.). The event was meant to highlight the pride of the Greeks in their culture and country for the world to see.

A significant part of the closing ceremony was the exchange of the Olympic flag of the Athens Games between the mayor of Athens and the mayor of Beijing, host city of the next Olympics. After the flag exchange a presentation from the Beijing delegation presented a glimpse into Chinese culture for the world to see. Beijing University students (who were at first incorrectly cited as the Twelve Girls Band) sang Mo Li Hua (Jasmine Flower) accompanied by a ribbon dancer, then some male dancers did a routine with tai chi and acrobatics, followed by dancers from the Peking Opera and finally, a little Chinese girl Chen Tianjia singing a reprise of Mo Li Hua and concluded the presentation by saying &quot;Welcome to Beijing!&quot;

The medal ceremony for the last event of the Olympics, the men&#x27;s marathon, was conducted, with Stefano Baldini from Italy as the winner. The bronze medal winner, Vanderlei Cordeiro de Lima of Brazil, was simultaneously announced as a recipient of the Pierre de Coubertin Medal for his bravery in finishing the race despite being attacked by a rogue spectator while leading with 7 km to go.

A flag-bearer from each nation&#x27;s delegation then entered along the stage, followed by the competitors &quot;en masse&quot; on the floor. All of them were led by Pyrros Dimas (weightlifter) and Liu Xiang (hurdler).

Short speeches were presented by Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, President of the Organising Committee, and by President Dr. Jacques Rogge of the IOC, in which he described the Athens Olympics as &quot;unforgettable, dream Games&quot;.

Dr. Rogge had previously declared he would be breaking with tradition in his closing speech as President of the IOC and that he would never use the words of his predecessor Juan Antonio Samaranch, who used to always say &#x27;these were the best ever games&#x27;. Dr. Rogge had described Salt Lake City 2002 as &quot;superb games&quot; and in turn would continue after Athens 2004 and describe Turin 2006 as &quot;truly magnificent games.&quot;

The national anthems of Greece and China were played in a handover ceremony as both nations&#x27; flags were raised. The Mayor of Athens, Dora Bakoyianni, passed the Olympic Flag to the Mayor of Beijing, Wang Qishan. After a short cultural performance by Chinese actors, dancers, and musicians directed by eminent Chinese director Zhang Yimou, Rogge declared the 2004 Olympic Games closed. The Olympic flag was next raised again on 10 February 2006 during the opening ceremony of the next Winter Olympics in Torino.

A young Greek girl, 10-year-old Fotini Papaleonidopoulou, lit a symbolic lantern with the Olympic Flame and passed it on to other children before &quot;extinguishing&quot; the flame in the cauldron by blowing a puff of air. The ceremony ended with a variety of musical performances by Greek singers, including Dionysis Savvopoulos, George Dalaras, Haris Alexiou, Anna Vissi, Sakis Rouvas, Eleftheria Arvanitaki, Alkistis Protopsalti, Antonis Remos, Michalis Hatzigiannis, Marinella, and Dimitra Galani, as thousands of athletes carried out symbolic displays on the stadium floor.

==Legacy==
To commemorate the 2004 Olympics, a series of Greek high value euro collectors&#x27; coins were minted by the Mint of Greece, in both silver and gold. The pieces depict landmarks in Greece as well as ancient and modern sports on the obverse of the coin. On the reverse, a common motif with the logo of the Games, circled by an olive branch representing the spirit of the Games.

Preparations to stage the Olympics led to a number of positive developments for the city&#x27;s infrastructure. These improvements included the establishment of Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport, a modern new international airport serving as Greece&#x27;s main aviation gateway; expansions to the Athens Metro system; the &quot;Tram&quot;, a new metropolitan tram (light rail) system system; the &quot;Proastiakos&quot;, a new suburban railway system linking the airport and suburban towns to the city of Athens; the &quot;Attiki Odos&quot;, a new toll motorway encircling the city, and the conversion of streets into pedestrianized walkways in the historic center of Athens which link several of the city&#x27;s main tourist sites, including the Parthenon and the Panathenaic Stadium (the site of the first modern Olympic Games in 1896). All of the above infrastructure is still in use to this day, and there have been continued expansions and proposals to expand Athens&#x27; metro, tram, suburban rail and motorway network, the airport, as well as further plans to pedestrianize more thoroughfares in the historic center of Athens.

The Greek Government has created a corporation, Olympic Properties SA, which is overseeing the post-Olympics management, development and conversion of these facilities, some of which will be sold off (or have already been sold off) to the private sector, while some other facilities are still in use, or have been converted for commercial use or modified for other sports.

As of 2012 many conversion schemes have stalled owing to the Greek government-debt crisis, though many of these facilities are now under the control of domestic sporting clubs and organizations or the private sector.

Ongoing maintenance costs for the facilities were problematic due to the Greek government-debt crisis, leading to facilities falling into disrepair, and, according to reports during the crisis period, many Greek Olympians at the time chose to train in Cyprus instead, owing to its then superior facilities.

The legacy of the facilities is also debated: although many facilities had plans for post-games utilisation, many of these plans never materialised, while questions remain about whether the initially limited post-games usage of certain facilities is outweighed by the significant initial expenditure on the facilities, alongside the ongoing maintenance costs (such arguments were mostly presented during the country&#x27;s debt crisis, which had affected many aspects of its functions).

The table below delineates the current status of the Athens Olympic facilities:

===Arguments about possible effects on Greece&#x27;s debt crisis===
There have been arguments (mostly in popular media) that the cost of the 2004 Athens Summer Games was a contributor to the Greek government-debt crisis that started in 2010, while a lot of focus has been on the use of the facilities after the Games. This argument contradicts the fact that Greece&#x27;s Debt to GDP ratio was essentially not affected until the 2008 world financial crisis, while according to Olympic officials and some financial experts, the cost of the Games, which was spread over years of preparation, was insignificant compared to Greece&#x27;s GDP and public debt.

Furthermore, the aforementioned arguments do not even take into account the profits (direct and indirect) generated by the Games, which may well have surpassed the above costs. Finally, popular arguments about &quot;rotting&quot; of many of the facilities, appear to ignore the actual utilization of many of these structures. On the other hand, the general government&#x27;s deficit increase between 2000 and 2004 from 4.1% to 8.8% was a result of multiple factors and, until 2008, the effect of Greece&#x27;s chronic - and widely fluctuating - deficits was counterbalanced by high GDP growth rates, leaving the Debt to GDP ratio essentially unaffected - see chart).

<text>The 2006 Winter Olympics (), officially the XX Olympic Winter Games () and also known as Torino 2006, were a winter multi-sport event held from 10 to 26 February in Turin, Italy. This marked the second time Italy had hosted the Winter Olympics, the first being in 1956 in Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo; Italy had also hosted the Summer Olympics in 1960 in Rome.

Turin was selected as the host city for the 2006 Games in June 1999. The official motto of Torino 2006 was &quot;Passion lives here&quot;. The Games&#x27; logo depicted a stylized profile of the Mole Antonelliana building, drawn in white and blue ice crystals, signifying the snow and the sky. The crystal web was also meant to portray the web of new technologies and the Olympic spirit of community. The 2006 Olympic mascots were Neve (&quot;snow&quot; in Italian), a female snowball, and Gliz, a male ice cube.

Italy is scheduled to host the Winter Olympics in 2026 in Milan and Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo, 20 years after the 2006 event and the city will host the speed skating events of the 2030 Winter Olympics with a project shared with the neighbour region of the French Alps.

==Host city selection==
Turin was chosen as the host of the Olympics at the 109th IOC Session in Seoul, South Korea on 19 June 1999. This decision was the first bidding process, after the IOC had adopted new election procedures during the 108th Extraordinary IOC Session in light of the controversies surrounding the votes for the 1998 and 2002 Winter Olympics.

Since IOC members were forbidden from visiting the candidate cities (in the interests of reducing bribery), the 109th IOC Session elected a special body, the Selection College, to choose finalist cities from the pool of candidate cities after each had made their final presentations to the full IOC Session.

The full IOC Session then voted on the cities chosen as finalist cities by the Selection College. Although six European cities presented their projects. Only two would advance to the final stage, which was the choice of the host city. At the first phase, all had to make the preliminary presentation in full IOC Session. All the members of the Selection College had to be present at the audience and it was their responsibility to decide which would be the two finalists. They decided that the cities were: the big favorite Sion and the dark horse of the process: Turin. The bids of Helsinki, Finland; Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia; Zakopane, Poland; and Klagenfurt, Austria were dropped by the Selection College after all six bidding cities made their presentations.

The selection of Turin over Sion came as a surprise around the world since the Swiss city was seen as the overwhelming favorite in part because the IOC had their headquarters in Switzerland. Some analysts attribute the choice of Turin as a reaction to Swiss IOC member Marc Hodler&#x27;s role in exposing the bribery scandal surrounding Salt Lake City&#x27;s bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics

The information below comes from the International Olympic Committee Vote History web page.

==Cost and cost overrun==
&quot;The Oxford Olympics Study&quot; established the outturn cost of the Torino 2006 Winter Olympics at US$4.4 billion in 2015-dollars and cost overrun at 80% in real terms. This includes sports-related costs only, that is, (i) &quot;operational costs&quot; incurred by the organizing committee for the purpose of staging the Games, e.g., expenditures for technology, transportation, workforce, administration, security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services, and (ii) &quot;direct capital costs&quot; incurred by the host city and country or private investors to build, e.g., the competition venues, the Olympic village, international broadcast center, and media and press center, which are required to host the Games. Indirect capital costs are &quot;not&quot; included, such as for road, rail, or airport infrastructure, or for hotel upgrades or other business investment incurred in preparation for the Games but not directly related to staging the Games. The cost and cost overrun for Torino 2006 compares with costs of US$2.5 billion and a cost overrun of 13% for Vancouver 2010, and costs of US$51 billion and a cost overrun of 289% for Sochi 2014, the latter being the most costly Olympics to date. Average cost for Winter Games since 1960 is US$3.1 billion, average cost overrun is 142%.

==Sports==

The 2006 Winter Olympics featured 84 medal events over 15 disciplines in 7 sports. Unlike the previous four editions of the Winter Games, no new sport/discipline was introduced. Eight new events were added in disciplines already on the Olympic program, including mass start in biathlon, team sprint in cross-country skiing, boarder cross in snowboard, and team pursuit in speed skating, all with both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s competitions. The International Ski Federation introduced an alternating system for cross-country skiing styles in certain events. Long-distance races (30 km for women and 50 km for men) that were contested in the classic style during the 2002 Winter Olympics were freestyle events in Torino.

The sports and disciplines that were contested at the 2006 Games:

# Biathlon
# Bobsleigh
#* 
# Curling
# Ice hockey
# Luge
# Skating
#* 
# Skiing

===Podium sweeps===
==Highlights==

===Day 1 (Opening Ceremony)===

Ice hockey began with the women&#x27;s competition; Sweden defeated Russia 3–1 in the first match while Canada&#x27;s team opened with the second most lopsided win in Olympic history by beating the host Italians 16–0.

===Day 3===
On 12 February, Latvia won its first winter Olympic medal when Mārtiņš Rubenis took the bronze in the men&#x27;s luge. Armin Zöggeler&#x27;s win in that event gave Italy its first gold medal of the Games and gave Zöggeler medals at four consecutive Olympics, including two golds in a row. In Alpine skiing, the men&#x27;s downhill was won by Antoine Deneriaz of France.

===Day 4===
Chinese figure skating pair Zhang Dan and Zhang Hao, trailing a dominant Russian pair, attempted a throw quadruple salchow jump—an element which had never been successfully completed in competition. Zhang Dan fell, injuring her knee, but the pair finished their program to a standing ovation and took the silver medal. Russia finished the third day of competition with two gold medals, as did the United States.

===Day 5===
The fourth day saw Evgeni Plushenko of Russia set a world record score in the men&#x27;s figure skating short program; his 90.66 points exceeded the nearest opponent&#x27;s score by more than 10 points. The men&#x27;s combined alpine skiing was riddled with disqualifications, including front-runners Bode Miller and Benjamin Raich. American Ted Ligety won the event in what was considered an upset.

===Day 6===
Canada had another strong day on 15 February, setting new Olympic records in both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s pursuit team speed skating events as well as opening the men&#x27;s ice hockey competition with a win against Italy. Italy finished the day with the men&#x27;s pursuit team Olympic record, however, after the Netherlands bettered Canada&#x27;s time only to have Italy improve upon theirs. China won its first gold of 2006 with Wang Meng&#x27;s victory in the women&#x27;s individual 500-metre short track speed skating. A pair of Austrian brothers Andreas Linger and Wolfgang Linger won the men&#x27;s doubles luge while Michaela Dorfmeister gave the nation another championship in the women&#x27;s downhill.

===Day 7===
Kristina Šmigun won her second gold medal of the Games with a victory in the women&#x27;s 10 kilometre classical cross-country skiing on 16 February, remaining the only Estonian to medal. In men&#x27;s curling action, Great Britain edged Germany 7–6, Switzerland kept New Zealand winless by winning 9–7, Canada beat Norway 7–6, and the United States defeated Sweden, 10–6. Evgeni Plushenko of Russia won the gold in the men&#x27;s singles artistic skating.

===Day 8===
On 17 February, Tanja Frieden of Switzerland took the gold in women&#x27;s snowboard cross after Lindsey Jacobellis of the United States fell on the second-to-last jump while performing an unnecessary method grab. Jacobellis settled for silver (she would have won gold if she had not performed the grab), while Canada&#x27;s Dominique Maltais took bronze after recovering from a crash. Duff Gibson of Canada took gold in the skeleton just ahead of fellow Canadian Jeff Pain, becoming the oldest individual gold medalist in Winter Olympics history. In the women&#x27;s ice hockey semifinals, the United States lost a shootout to Sweden, marking the first time in international competition that the United States had lost to anyone other than Canada. Canada&#x27;s win maintained its record of never having lost to anyone other than the United States.

===Day 9===
Kjetil André Aamodt won gold for Norway in the men&#x27;s super-G on 18 February, beating Hermann Maier of Austria. Germans Kati Wilhelm and Martina Glagow finished first and second in the 10 kilometre biathlon pursuit. The host Italians defeated Canada in men&#x27;s curling, while Switzerland did the same in men&#x27;s ice hockey to put the Canadians on the wrong end of two major upsets on the same day. The United States men&#x27;s ice hockey team suffered its first loss of the tournament as Slovakia and Russia continue their dominance of the pool.

===Day 10===
Lascelles Brown became the first Jamaican-born competitor to win a medal at the Winter Olympics on 19 February, competing on the Canadian 2-man bobsleigh team which finished second in an extremely tight competition. The German pair was only .21 seconds ahead of the Canadians, themselves only .14 ahead of the Swiss team. Finland continued to be unbeaten in men&#x27;s ice hockey, handing Canada its second loss.

The day also saw the most hyped event of these games, at least in Europe, as the Men&#x27;s 10 km Cross Country Relay was scheduled. The battle stemmed from the Lillehammer games 12 years ago in which Italy out-dueled Norway in that very same event. To that extent, many Norwegians wanted to win this event in order to embarrass the Italians on their home turf, but it was not to be as Italy crushed the field winning over Germany by over 15 seconds to take their 5th straight gold in this event. Norway failed to medal for the first time since 1988.

===Day 11===
The final day of curling pool play was 20 February; Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and Canada advanced to the women&#x27;s semifinals while Finland, Canada, the United States, and Great Britain qualified in the men&#x27;s competition. Austria took their first team gold medal in ski jumping, while Canada took their second in women&#x27;s ice hockey.

===Day 12===
Slovakia and Finland both won their final men&#x27;s ice hockey games on 21 February to win their respective pools with 5–0–0 records. Enrico Fabris gave the host nation another gold medal in speed skating by winning the men&#x27;s 1500 metres.

===Day 13===
On 22 February, the twelfth day of competition, Anja Pärson won her first gold medal in the women&#x27;s slalom; it was her fifth overall Olympic medal and third of the 2006 Games. Chandra Crawford took a quicker route to the top of the podium, winning the 1.1 kilometre cross-country sprint gold in her Olympic debut. In the men&#x27;s ice hockey quarterfinals, the previously undefeated Slovaks lost to the Czech Republic while Russia, Finland, and Sweden eliminated Canada, the United States, and Switzerland, respectively. Philipp Schoch successfully defended his snowboarding giant slalom gold against his brother Simon.

===Day 14===
Sweden took the women&#x27;s championship in the curling finals held on 23 February. Shizuka Arakawa gave Japan its first gold medal of the Games and first figure skating gold medal, winning the ladies&#x27; figure skating competition in part by being able to finish without falling, as Sasha Cohen and Irina Slutskaya both tumbled. Russia wrested the gold medal in women&#x27;s team biathlon from Germany.

===Day 15===
24 February was the day of the men&#x27;s curling finals, in which Canada won its first gold medal and the United States won its first medal in the sport as Canada defeated Finland and the United States beat Great Britain for the second time. The figure skating gala was also held, with top placers in all of the events performing exhibitions. Sweden and Finland won their men&#x27;s ice hockey semifinal games, defeating the Czech Republic and Russia.

===Day 16===
The Austrians swept the men&#x27;s alpine slalom medals on 25 February, led by Benjamin Raich. Germany took gold medals in the men&#x27;s 15 kilometer biathlon and the men&#x27;s individual bobsleigh. Apolo Anton Ohno won his second short track speed skating gold medal. South Korea&#x27;s Jin Sun-Yu wins her third gold of the Games in the women&#x27;s 1000 m. Compatriot Ahn Hyun-Soo wins his third gold medal of the Games, medaling in every men&#x27;s short track event and bringing his total number of medals in Turin to four.

===Day 17 (Closing ceremony)===
The final day of competition and the closing ceremony, were held during the Sunday Carnival on 26 February. The Swedish men&#x27;s ice hockey team handed Finland their first loss in the final to take the gold medal. In the closing ceremony, Manuela Di Centa, a seven-time Olympic medalist from Italy and then-member of the International Olympic Committee, was scheduled to present the medals for the men&#x27;s 50-kilometre cross-country skiing event. This resulted in her presenting the gold medal to her own brother when Giorgio Di Centa won the event to take his second gold medal.

==Broadcasting==
About 40% of the television coverage of the Olympics was in high definition.

The 2006 Winter Olympic Games were broadcast worldwide by a number of television broadcasters:

==Controversies==
The Games had issues with covering costs and international attendance. Due to a lack of funding by the Italian Government, TOROC risked dissolution.

===Metro===
The metro was finally opened to the public on 4 February 2006, after a 45-day delay. It operated on a shorter stretch (&quot;XVIII Dicembre&quot; (Porta Susa) to &quot;Fermi&quot; – 11 stations) than originally forecast; it finally reached the main railway station (&quot;Porta Nuova&quot;) and the rest of the city centre more than one year after the Games, in October 2007. For the duration of the Games, a single ticket (5 euros) covered use of both the metro and other means of public transportation for a whole day. However, during the Games, metro service stopped at 6:00 pm, making it impractical for spectators of evening events. Furthermore, the metro did not reach any of the Olympic venues. On the other hand, the bus service was heavily improved for the Games, although still inadequate at night hours.

===Doping===
During the games, Italian police raided the Austrian athletes&#x27; quarters in search of evidence of blood doping. The raid was conducted due to suspicions over the presence of biathlon coach Walter Mayer, who had been banned from all Olympic events up to and including the Vancouver Olympic Games in 2010 due to previous doping convictions. Around the time of the raid Mayer and two Austrian biathletes, Wolfgang Perner and Wolfgang Rottmann, tried to escape and fled back to Austria. Later, the Austrian ski federation president said that the two athletes told him they &quot;may have used illegal methods&quot;. Six skiers and four biathletes were also taken for drug screens by the IOC. Those substance screens later returned negative results.

On 25 April 2007, six Austrian athletes (Roland Diethard, Johannes Eder, Wolfgang Perner, Jürgen Pinter, Wolfgang Rottmann and Martin Tauber) were banned for life from the Olympics for their involvement in the doping scandal at the 2006 Turin Olympics, the first time the IOC punished athletes without a positive or missed doping test. The Austrians were found guilty of possessing doping substances and taking part in a conspiracy, based on materials seized by Italian police during the raid on the living quarters. The Austrians also had their competition results from Turin annulled.

List of athletes with doping convictions in these Games:
* Russian Olga Pyleva was stripped of her silver and other medals in the 15 km biathlon event after testing positive for carphedon.
* Brazilian bobsled athlete Armando dos Santos, ejected from the Games after a preventive antidoping test came positive (the results were from a test conducted in Brazil).

The IOC has retested nearly 500 doping samples that were collected at the 2006 Turin Games. In 2014, the Estonian Olympic Committee was notified by the IOC that a retested sample from cross-country skier Kristina Šmigun had tested positive. On 24 October 2016, the World Anti-Doping Agency Athletes&#x27; Commission stated that Šmigun, who won two gold medals at the Turin Games, faces a Court of Arbitration for Sport hearing before the end of October. In December 2017, IOC announced that re-analysis of samples resulted in no positive cases.

===Ratings and attendance===

A number of events reported low spectator attendance despite having acceptable ticket sales. Preliminary competition and locally less popular sports failed to attract capacity crowd as expected. Organizers explained this was because blocks of seats were reserved or purchased by sponsors and partners who later did not show up at the events.

Several news organizations reported that many Americans were not as interested in the Olympics as in years past. It has been suggested that reasons for this lack of interest include the tape delayed coverage, which showed events in prime-time as much as 18 hours later in the Western United States. Primetime viewing figures in Canada were also disappointing, especially after the early exit of the Canadian men&#x27;s hockey team, though overall viewing figures were up from 2002.

==Olympic legacy==

The Olympics represented an opportunity to revamp the city&#x27;s look and change its traditional image as an industrial city by showing the world its hidden side of vibrant cultural life and stunning architectures.
Thanks to the olympic exposure and state of the art venues, Turin has become one of Italy&#x27;s primary tourist destinations and has been established as an important sport center in Europe.

Since 2006, TOP (Torino Olympic Park) has been the agency in charge of managing the Olympic facilities.

==Security measures==
As with every Olympics since the Munich massacre at the 1972 Summer Olympics and then increasingly since the Salt Lake 2002 Winter Olympics in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, there was heavy security due to fears of terrorism.

The organizers further increased security measures in connection with the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy and insisted that the Olympic Games were going to be safe, which they were; the Olympics concluded without a major breach of security occurring.

<text>Wayne&#x27;s World is a 1992 American comedy film directed by Penelope Spheeris. It was produced by Lorne Michaels and written by Mike Myers and Bonnie &amp; Terry Turner. Based on the SNL sketch by Myers, it stars Myers in his feature film debut as Wayne Campbell and Dana Carvey as Garth Algar, a pair of rock and heavy metal fans who broadcast a public-access television show. It also features Tia Carrere, Rob Lowe, Lara Flynn Boyle and Brian Doyle-Murray in supporting roles, with cameos by Chris Farley, Ed O&#x27;Neill, Ione Skye, Meat Loaf, Robert Patrick and Alice Cooper.

&quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; was released in the United States on February 14, 1992, by Paramount Pictures. A critical and commercial success, it was the tenth-highest-grossing film of 1992 and remains the highest-grossing film based on a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketch. A sequel, &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World 2&quot;, was released the following year.

==Plot==

In Aurora, Illinois, rock music fans Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar host a public-access television show, &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;, from Wayne&#x27;s parents&#x27; basement; a broadcast of &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; catches the attention of television producer Benjamin Kane. While out cruising with friends in Garth&#x27;s car, the Mirthmobile, Wayne stops to admire a 1964 Fender Stratocaster in a shop window. They later go to a nightclub, where they avoid Wayne&#x27;s troubled ex-girlfriend Stacy while Wayne falls for Cassandra Wong, vocalist and bassist of the band Crucial Taunt. Wayne learns Cantonese to impress Cassandra at a later encounter.

Benjamin meets with Wayne and Garth to purchase the rights to the show for $5,000 each, which Wayne uses to purchase the Stratocaster. Benjamin attempts to court Cassandra using his wealth and good looks, distracting Wayne and Garth with all-access tickets to an Alice Cooper concert in Milwaukee while offering to produce a music video for Crucial Taunt. At the show, Wayne and Garth make the acquaintance of a bodyguard to music producer Frankie Sharp, head of Sharp Records.

While filming the revamped &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; under Benjamin&#x27;s oversight, Wayne and Garth find adjusting to the professional studio environment challenging. Their contract obliges them to give a promotional interview to their sponsor, Noah Vanderhoff, who owns a franchise of amusement arcades. After Wayne ridicules Vanderhoff on the show, he is fired, leaving Garth to host the show on his own. This infuriates Garth and jeopardizes their friendship. Jealous of the attention Benjamin is giving Cassandra, Wayne attempts to prevent her from participating in the Crucial Taunt music video shoot, and she breaks up with him for his distrust.

Wayne and Garth reconcile and hatch a scheme to win Cassandra back by getting her a record deal. They plan to ensure that Frankie Sharp hears Crucial Taunt play. While Garth and their friends infiltrate a satellite station with the aid of Benjamin&#x27;s assistant, Wayne goes to Cassandra&#x27;s video shoot but embarrasses himself in an attempt to expose Benjamin&#x27;s ulterior motive. Cassandra initially tells him to go home, but realizing Benjamin is up to no good, she changes her mind and leaves for Aurora with Wayne while he apologizes.

The &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; crew hacks into Sharp&#x27;s satellite television and broadcasts the Crucial Taunt performance from Wayne&#x27;s basement, where Sharp and Benjamin converge. Sharp declines to offer Crucial Taunt a record contract. As a result, Cassandra breaks up with Wayne permanently. She and Benjamin depart to a tropical resort. Stacy reveals she is pregnant with Wayne&#x27;s child. An electrical fire destroys Wayne&#x27;s house and kills Garth.

Dissatisfied with this ending, Wayne and Garth turn to the film&#x27;s audience and halt proceedings. They restart the scene and unmask Benjamin as &quot;Old Man Withers&quot; in a &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; parody ending. Still unsatisfied, they restart again with a &quot;mega happy ending,&quot; in which Cassandra successfully signs a record contract and rekindles her relationship with Wayne. Garth begins a relationship with a waitress he has fantasized over, while a reformed Benjamin learns that money and good looks do not necessarily bring happiness.

During the credits, both Wayne and Garth wait until the credits finish to fade to black.

==Cast==
* Mike Myers as Wayne Campbell, host of &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World.&quot; Wayne lives with his parents in Aurora, Illinois, and spends his free time &quot;partying&quot; with his friends in and around the popular rock/metal scene of the early 1990s. His best friend is Garth Algar, with whom he hosts their late-night cable-access show broadcasting from the basement of Wayne&#x27;s parents&#x27; house.
* Dana Carvey as Garth Algar, Wayne&#x27;s best friend and co-host. Garth is socially awkward and more stereotypically &quot;nerdy&quot; and introverted than his more outgoing friends.

* Tia Carrere as Cassandra Wong, lead vocalist and bassist of the local rock band, Crucial Taunt. She and her band perform gigs around town, notably at a heavy metal bar frequented by Wayne and his friends called The Gasworks. Cassandra is a Cantonese immigrant who claims to have learned English at college and from the &quot;Police Academy&quot; films.
* Rob Lowe as Benjamin Kane, a sleazy, Chicago-based television producer. His official title is Regional Programming Director for Oliver Communications. Benjamin is good-looking, well-educated, and highly successful, but cynical, manipulative, and ruthless in his approach to business.
* Lara Flynn Boyle as Stacy, Wayne&#x27;s troubled ex-girlfriend. Lacking self-esteem, she does not understand or accept that Wayne has broken up with her and still treats him like they are a couple.
* Brian Doyle-Murray as Noah Vanderhoff, a video arcade magnate, and a prospective client of Benjamin&#x27;s who is seeking to place him as the primary corporate sponsor of a television show aimed at teens and younger adults.

* Meat Loaf as Tiny, a doorman/bouncer at the Gasworks with whom Wayne and Garth are &quot;in.&quot; He allows them to skip the line at the door, and informs them about the bands playing and if they are good or not.
* Frank DiLeo as rock promoter Frankie &#x27;Mr. Big&#x27; Sharp. The CEO of Sharp Records, Frank takes a very hands-on approach to his business, driving back and forth across the country to find new acts to sign to his label. He is afraid of flying, and thus takes his stretch limousine everywhere.
* Ed O&#x27;Neill as Glen, the darkly disturbed manager at Stan Mikita&#x27;s Donuts. According to Wayne, he works at the donut shop &quot;24 hours a day&quot;. He makes frequent references to death, dying, and killing, and implies that he once murdered someone in the heat of passion.
* Michael DeLuise as Alan, one of Wayne and Garth&#x27;s crew.
* Lee Tergesen as Terry, Wayne and Garth&#x27;s head cameraman who has a penchant for openly expressing platonic love for his friends through hugging and repeatedly telling them, &quot;I love you, man.&quot;
* Dan Bell as Neil, Wayne and Garth&#x27;s second cameraman.
* Sean Gregory Sullivan as Phil, Wayne and Garth&#x27;s friend who works at an auto repair shop. Wayne describes him as being frequently &quot;partied out,&quot; a state of heavy intoxication which renders Phil near-catatonic and unable to recall events of the previous evening.

* Alice Cooper with Pete Friesen, Derek Sherinian, Stef Burns, and Jimmy DeGrasso as themselves, performing &quot;Feed My Frankenstein&quot;. Wayne and Garth go to see him backstage at his show, where they receive a lecture on the history of Milwaukee.

==Production==
&quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; was green-lit by Paramount Pictures in 1991. It was the second film based on a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketch, following &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; in 1980. Producer Lorne Michaels hired Penelope Spheeris to direct, after she had directed several music documentaries. Spheeris said, &quot;I had been just struggling as a female director in this business for many years. I was 45 years old when I got that job. I just kept hanging in there. And &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; happened, and it sort of flipped my life around.&quot;

Spheeris clashed with Myers during filming. She told &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; that Myers was &quot;emotionally needy and got more difficult as the shoot went along. You should have heard him bitching when I was trying to do that &#x27;Bohemian Rhapsody&#x27; scene: &#x27;I can&#x27;t move my neck like that! Why do we have to do this so many times? No one is going to laugh at that!&#x27;&quot; She said she attempted to assuage Myers by having her daughter provide him snacks, and on one occasion he stormed off the set, upset that there was no margarine for his bagel. Myers and Spheeris argued over the final cut, causing Myers to prevent Spheeris from directing &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World 2&quot;. Despite this, in 2022 Spheeris said the conflict between her and Myers had been overstated, and that the margarine incident was the only time when she felt Myers was being outright unreasonable.

===Soundtrack===

The soundtrack album reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album was certified double-Platinum by the RIAA on July 16, 1997.

The studio and Lorne Michaels originally wanted to use a Guns N&#x27; Roses song for the headbanging scene, but Myers demanded &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, even threatening to quit the production unless it was used. Freddie Mercury, the lead singer of Queen, died of bronchial pneumonia resulting from AIDS a few months before the film&#x27;s release. According to Brian May, Mercury saw the headbanging scene before his death, found it hilarious and approved the song for the film&#x27;s use. However, Spheeris disputed May&#x27;s recollection in a 2022 interview, saying that &quot;My guess is it&#x27;s not true.&quot; She explained that due to the short timeframe between the completion of the film and Mercury&#x27;s death, she believes it is highly unlikely that anyone would have had access to a tape of the scene to show Mercury.

In the &quot;No Stairway To Heaven&quot; scene, the first four notes played of &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; were replaced with a different set of guitar notes in all home media releases of the film, since home video publishers considered the $100,000 cost of licensing the song to be too high. The original notes were restored with the 4K Blu-Ray release in 2022.

Gary Wright re-recorded &quot;Dream Weaver&quot; for the film, which is heard whenever Wayne looks at Cassandra.

Tia Carrere sang her own vocals on the songs she performed in the film, as well as cover songs such as Sweet&#x27;s &quot;The Ballroom Blitz&quot;, which were included on the film&#x27;s soundtrack album.

Myers originally wanted Alice Cooper&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Eighteen&quot; and &quot;School&#x27;s Out&quot; in the film, but Cooper&#x27;s manager Shep Gordon convinced him to use &quot;Feed My Frankenstein&quot; instead. It was Myers&#x27; first meeting with Gordon and it made such a strong, positive impression on him that they formed a friendship. Myers directed a 2014 documentary about Gordon, titled &quot;&quot;.

==Release==
The film was a box office success, debuting at number one. The film&#x27;s final domestic gross was $121,697,323, making it the eighth-highest-grossing film of 1992 and the highest-grossing of the 11 films based on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; skits.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 79% based on 96 reviews, with an average rating of 6.60/10, with the critical consensus stating, &quot;An oddball comedy that revels in its silliness and memorable catch phrases, &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; is also fondly regarded because of its endearing characters.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 57 out of 100 based on reviews from 14 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four and said in his review: &quot;I walked into &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; expecting a lot of dumb, vulgar comedy, and I got plenty, but I also found what I didn&#x27;t expect: a genuinely amusing, sometimes even intelligent, undercurrent.&quot; Gene Siskel called the film a &quot;very funny and most original comedy&quot; with &quot;inspired bits of whimsy,&quot; and ranked it number eight on his list of the ten best movies of 1992. Desson Howe wrote in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that making a movie out of such a &quot;teeny sketch&quot; is &quot;better than you&#x27;d expect&quot;, but criticized the finale as &quot;an attempt to lampoon movie endings&quot; &quot;and a despair-driven inability to end the movie&quot;. Filipino columnist Jullie Y. Daza of the &quot;Manila Standard&quot; stated that &quot;I didn&#x27;t know what the generation gap meant until I saw this silly, nonsensical movie called &#x27;Wayne&#x27;s World&#x27; and I saw how my son went stark raving mad over it.&quot;

===In popular culture===

Filled with pop culture references, the sketches and the film started catchphrases such as &quot;Schwing!&quot; and &quot;Schyea&quot;, as well as popularizing &quot;That&#x27;s what she said&quot;, &quot;Party on!&quot;, and the use of &quot;... Not!&quot; after an apparently affirmative sentence to state the contrary, and &quot;We’re not worthy! We&#x27;re not worthy!&quot;

The scene in which Wayne, Garth, and friends lip-sync to Queen&#x27;s &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; in an AMC Pacer is one of the most well-known scenes in the film. Due to its prominent appearance in &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;, &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; reached #2 in the United States and reignited the band&#x27;s popularity in the country.

The Pacer was produced by American Motors Corporation (AMC) from 1975 to 1980. The car was purposely a second-hand Pacer painted baby blue with flames on the sides and non-matching wheels, which Wayne and Garth dubbed &quot;The Mirthmobile&quot;. The original car from the film was sold and appeared in a 2015 episode of &quot;Pawn Stars&quot;. The car was restored to running condition with the original movie props inside the car, but with a functional stereo system added. The Pacer was sold in 2016 for $37,400. Because of &quot;The Mirthmobile&quot; role, the Pacer is arguably one of the two most famous AMC cars featured in film or TV, the other being &quot;Dixie&quot;, the Jeep CJ-7 driven by Daisy Duke in &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;.

&quot;Between The Lions&quot;, a puppet-based children&#x27;s television series from 2000-2010, produced a short repeating segment called &quot;Gawain&#x27;s Word,&quot; featuring two jousting knights charging at each other, each touting a speech balloon with half of a word which then became their respective names, then demonstrating the word. Though the title of the segment clearly is a parody of the SNL skit, the two knights in the segment speak more characteristically like Bill and Ted from &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Excellent Adventure&quot; than Wayne and Garth from Wayne&#x27;s World.

The cast, crew, and other related musical guests were part of Josh Gad&#x27;s &quot;Reunited Apart&quot; web series&#x27; second season, first available in December 2020.

<text>The 2008 Summer Olympics (), officially the Games of the XXIX Olympiad () and officially branded as Beijing 2008 (), were an international multisport event held from 8 to 24 August 2008, in Beijing, China. A total of 10,942 athletes from 204 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) competed in 28 sports and 302 events, one event more than those scheduled for the 2004 Summer Olympics. This was the first time China had hosted the Olympic Games, and the third time the Summer Olympic Games had been held in East Asia, following the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, and the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. These were also the second Summer Olympic Games to be held in a communist state, the first being the 1980 Summer Olympics in the Soviet Union (with venues in Russia, Ukraine, Byelorussia, and Estonia).
Beijing was awarded the 2008 Games over four competitors on 13 July 2001, having won a majority of votes from members of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) after two rounds of voting. The Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China promoted the 2008 Games and invested heavily in new facilities and transport systems. 37 venues were used to host the events, including twelve constructed specifically for the 2008 Games. The equestrian events were held in Hong Kong, making these the third Olympics for which the events were held under the jurisdiction of two different NOCs. The sailing events were contested in Qingdao, while the football events took place across several different cities.

The official logo for the 2008 Games, titled &quot;Dancing Beijing&quot; (), created by Guo Chunning (), featured the Chinese character for &quot;capital&quot; (, stylized into the shape of a human being) in reference to the host city. The 2008 Olympics were watched by 3.5 billion people worldwide, and featured the longest distance for an Olympic Torch relay. The 2008 Games also set numerous world and Olympic records, and were the most expensive Summer Olympics of all time, and the second most expensive overall, after the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi. The opening ceremony was lauded by spectators and numerous international presses as spectacular, spellbinding, and by many accounts, &quot;the greatest ever in the history of Olympics&quot;. Beijing hosted the 2022 Winter Olympics, making it the first city ever to host both the Summer and Winter Games.

An unprecedented 87 countries won at least one medal during the 2008 Games. Host nation China won the most gold medals (48), and became the seventh different team to top the Summer Olympics medal standings, winning a total of 100 medals overall. The United States placed second in the gold medal tally but won the highest number of medals overall (112). The third place in the gold and overall medal tally was achieved by Russia.

This Olympic Games marked the return of the Summer Olympic Games to Asia after the 1988 Olympics in South Korea. It was the first Olympics for Serbia as a separate state since 1912 and the first for Montenegro, having separated from Serbia in 2006. It was also the first Olympics for Nepal as a republic, the Marshall Islands and Tuvalu. Mongolia and Panama each won their first Olympic gold medal. In addition, Afghanistan, Mauritius, Serbia, Sudan, Tajikistan and Togo won their first Olympic medals at these Games. North Korea, having symbolically marched with South Korea as one team at the opening ceremonies of the preceding three Games that it entered (2000 in Sydney, 2004 in Athens, and 2006 in Turin), paraded separately this time.

==Organization==
===Bid===

Under the direction of Liu Qi, Beijing was elected as the host city for the 2008 Summer Olympics on 13 July 2001, during the 112th IOC Session in Moscow, defeating bids from Toronto, Paris, Istanbul, and Osaka. Prior to the session, five other cities (Bangkok, Cairo, Havana, Kuala Lumpur, and Seville) had submitted bids to the IOC, but failed to make the short list chosen by the IOC Executive Committee in 2000. After the first round of voting, Beijing held a significant lead over the other four candidates. Osaka received only six votes and was eliminated. In the second round, Beijing was supported by a majority of voters, eliminating the need for subsequent rounds. Toronto&#x27;s bid was its fifth failure since 1960 (failed bids for 1960, 1964, 1976 and 1996 Games, losing to Rome, Tokyo, Montreal and Atlanta).

Members of the IOC did not disclose their votes, but news reports speculated that broad international support led to China&#x27;s selection, especially from developing nations that had received assistance from China to construct stadiums. The size of China, its increased enforcement of doping controls, and sympathy concerning its loss of the 2000 Summer Olympics to Sydney were all factors in the decision. Eight years earlier, Beijing had led every round of voting for the 2000 Summer Olympics before losing to Sydney by two votes in the final round.

Human rights concerns expressed by Amnesty International and politicians in both Europe and North America were considered by the delegates, according to IOC Executive Director François Carrard. Carrard and others suggested that the selection might lead to improvements in human rights in China. In addition, many IOC delegates who had formerly been athletes expressed concern about heat and air quality during the Games, considering the high levels of air pollution in Beijing. China outlined plans to address these environmental concerns in its bid application.

===Costs===


On 6 March 2009, the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games reported that total spending on the Games was &quot;generally as much as that of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games&quot;, which was equivalent to about US$15 billion. They went on to claim that surplus revenues from the Games would exceed the original target of $16 million. Other reports, however, estimated the total costs from $40 to $44 billion, which would make the Games &quot;far and away the most expensive ever&quot;. Its budget was later exceeded by the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, which suffered from major cost overruns; the 2014 Winter Olympics costed roughly US$50 billion in public funding. The &quot;Oxford Olympics Study 2016&quot; estimates the outturn cost of the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics at US$6.8 billion in 2015-dollars. This includes sports-related costs only, such as those incurred by the organizing committee or those incurred by the host city, country, and private investors to build structures required to host the Games. Indirect capital costs—those not directly related to staging the Games—are not included. The Beijing Olympics&#x27; cost of US$6.8 billion compares with costs of US$4.6 billion for Rio 2016 and US$15 billion for London 2012.

===Venues===
By May 2007 the construction of all 31 Beijing-based Olympic Games venues had begun. The Chinese government renovated and constructed six venues outside Beijing, and constructed 59 training facilities. The largest structures built were the Beijing National Stadium, Beijing National Indoor Stadium, Beijing National Aquatics Center, Peking University Gymnasium, Olympic Green Convention Center, Olympic Green, and Beijing Wukesong Culture &amp; Sports Center. Almost 85% of the construction budget for the six main venues was funded by $2.1 billion (RMB¥17.4 billion) in corporate bids and tenders. Investments were expected from corporations seeking ownership rights after the Olympics. Some events were held outside Beijing, namely football in Qinhuangdao, Shanghai, Shenyang, and Tianjin; sailing in Qingdao; and, because of the &quot;uncertainties of equine diseases and major difficulties in establishing a disease-free zone&quot;, the equestrian events were held in Hong Kong. Some stadiums were built on the former site of hutong neighbourhoods, including Qianmen Subdistrict.

The showpiece of the 2008 Summer Olympics was the Beijing National Stadium, nicknamed &quot;The Bird&#x27;s Nest&quot; because of its nest-like skeletal structure. The stadium hosted both the opening and closing ceremonies, as well as the athletics competition. Construction of the venue began on 24 December 2003. The Guangdong Olympic Stadium was originally planned, constructed, and completed in 2001 to help host the Games, but a decision was made to construct a new stadium in Beijing. In 2001, the city held a bidding process to select the best arena design. Several criteria were required of each design, including flexibility for post-Olympics use, a retractable roof, and low maintenance costs. The entry list was narrowed to thirteen final designs. The bird&#x27;s nest model submitted by architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron in collaboration with Li Xinggang of China Architecture Design and Research Group (CADG) was selected as the top design by both a professional panel and by a broader audience during a public exhibition. The selection of the design became official in April 2003. Construction of the stadium was a joint venture among the original designers, project architect Stefan Marbach, artist Ai Weiwei, and a group of CADG architects led by Li Xinggang. Its $423 million cost was funded by the state-owned corporate conglomerate CITIC and the Beijing State-Owned Assets Management Company.

===Transport===
To prepare for Olympic visitors, Beijing&#x27;s transportation infrastructure was expanded. Beijing&#x27;s airport underwent a major renovation with the addition of the new Terminal 3, designed by architect Norman Foster. Within the city itself, Beijing&#x27;s subway was doubled in capacity and length, with the addition of seven lines and 80 stations to the previously existing four lines and 64 stations. Included in this expansion was a new link connecting to the city&#x27;s airport. A fleet of thousands of buses, minibuses, and official cars transported spectators, athletes, and officials between venues.

In an effort to improve air quality, the city placed restrictions on construction sites and gas stations and limited the use of commercial and passenger vehicles in Beijing. From 20 July through 20 September, passenger vehicle restrictions were placed on alternative days depending on the terminal digit of the car&#x27;s license plate. It was anticipated that this measure would take 45% of Beijing&#x27;s 3.3 million cars off the streets. The boosted public transport network was expected to absorb the demand created by these restrictions and the influx of visitors, which was estimated at more than 4 million additional passengers per day.

===Marketing===

The 2008 Summer Olympics emblem was known as Dancing Beijing. The emblem combined a traditional Chinese red seal and a representation of the calligraphic character for &quot;capital&quot; (, also the second character of Beijing&#x27;s Chinese name) with athletic features. The open arms of the calligraphic word symbolized the invitation from China to the world to share in its culture. IOC president Jacques Rogge was rather pleased with the emblem, saying, &quot;Your new emblem immediately conveys the awesome beauty and power of China which are embodied in your heritage and your people.&quot;

The official motto for the 2008 Olympics was &quot;One World, One Dream&quot; (). It called upon the whole world to join in the Olympic spirit and build a better future for humanity, and was chosen from over 210,000 entries submitted from around the world. Following the announcement of the motto, the phrase was used by international advocates of Tibetan secession. Banners reading &quot;One World, One Dream, Free Tibet&quot; were unfurled from various structures around the globe in the lead up to the Beijing Olympics, such as from the San Francisco Golden Gate Bridge and the Sydney Opera House in Australia.

The mascots of Beijing 2008 were the five Fuwa, each of which represented both a color of the Olympic rings and a symbol of Chinese culture. In 2006, the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games released pictograms of 35 Olympic disciplines (however, for some multidiscipline sports such as cycling, a single pictogram was released). This set of sport icons was named &quot;the beauty of seal characters&quot;, because of each pictogram&#x27;s likeness to Chinese seal script.

=== Mascots ===

The mascots of the 2008 Summer Olympics were the Fuwa, created by Han Meilin (). The mascots consisted of Beibei, a fish, Jingjing, a panda, Huanhuan, an Olympic flame, Yingying, a Tibetan antelope, and Nini, a sand martin kite. When their Chinese characters are combined, they form , or &quot;Beijing Welcomes You&quot;. A year before the Games in 2007, the 100-episode The Olympic Adventures of Fuwa featuring the mascots, was released.

=== Media coverage ===
The 2008 Games were the first to be produced and broadcast entirely in high definition by the host broadcaster. In comparison, American broadcaster NBC broadcast only half of the Turin 2006 Winter Olympics in HD. In their bid for the Olympic Games in 2001, Beijing stated to the Olympic Evaluation Commission that there would be &quot;no restrictions on media reporting and movement of journalists up to and including the Olympic Games.&quot; However, some media outlets claimed that organizers ultimately failed to live up to this commitment.

According to Nielsen Media Research, 4.7 billion viewers worldwide tuned in to some of the television coverage, one-fifth larger than the 3.9 billion who watched the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. American broadcaster NBC produced only two hours of online streaming video for the 2006 Winter Games but produced approximately 2,200 hours of coverage for the 2008 Summer Games. CNN reported that, for the first time, &quot;live online video rights in some markets for the Olympics have been separately negotiated, not part of the overall &#x27;broadcast rights.&#x27;&quot; The new media of the digital economy was said to be growing &quot;nine times faster than the rest of the advertising market.&quot;

The international European Broadcasting Union (EBU) provided live coverage and highlights of all arenas only for certain territories on their website, Eurovisionsports.tv. Many national broadcasters likewise restricted the viewing of online events to their domestic audiences. The General National Copyright Administration of China announced that &quot;individual (&quot;sic&quot;) and websites will face fines as high as 100,000 yuan for uploading recordings of Olympic Games video to the internet&quot;, part of an extensive campaign to protect the pertinent intellectual property rights. The Olympic Committee also set up a separate YouTube channel at Beijing 2008.

=== Theme song ===
The theme song of the 2008 Summer Olympics was &quot;You and Me&quot;, which was composed by Chen Qigang, the musical director of the opening ceremony. It was performed during the opening ceremony by Chinese singer Liu Huan and British singer Sarah Brightman. The theme song was originally going to be a song called &quot;So much love, so far away (Tanto amor, tan lejos)&quot; written by Cuban singer-songwriter Jon Secada and Peruvian singer-songwriter Gian Marco under production from Cuban producer Emilio Estefan Jr. from EMI.

== Torch relay ==


The design of the 2008 Olympic Torch was based on traditional scrolls and used a traditional Chinese design known as the &quot;Propitious Clouds&quot; (祥云). The torch was designed to remain lit in 65 km/h (40 mph) winds, and in rain of up to 50 mm (2 in) per hour.

The relay, with the theme &quot;Journey of Harmony&quot;, was met with protests and demonstrations by pro-Tibet supporters throughout its journey. It lasted 130 days and carried the torch —the longest distance of any Olympic torch relay since the tradition began at the 1936 Berlin Games. The torch relay was described as a &quot;public relations disaster&quot; for China by &quot;USA Today&quot;, with protests against China&#x27;s human rights record, particularly focused on Tibet. The IOC subsequently barred future Olympics organizers from staging international torch relays.

The relay began 24 March 2008, in Olympia, Greece. From there, it traveled across Greece to Panathinaiko Stadium in Athens, and then to Beijing, arriving on 31 March. From Beijing, the torch followed a route passing through every continent except Antarctica. The torch visited cities on the Silk Road, symbolizing ancient links between China and the rest of the world. A total of 21,880 torchbearers were selected from around the world by various organizations and entities.

The international portion of the relay was problematic. The month-long world tour encountered wide-scale anti-Chinese protests. After trouble in London involving attempts by protesters to put out the flame, the torch was extinguished in Paris the following day. The American leg in San Francisco on 9 April was altered without prior warning to avoid such disturbances, although there were still demonstrations along the original route. The relay was further delayed and simplified after the 2008 Sichuan earthquake hit western China.
The flame was carried to the top of Mount Everest on a long &quot;highway&quot; scaling the Tibetan side of the mountain, built especially for the relay. The $19.7 million blacktop project spanned from Tingri County of Xigazê Prefecture to the Everest Base Camp. In March 2008, China banned mountaineers from climbing its side of Mount Everest, and later persuaded the Nepalese government to close their side as well, officially citing environmental concerns. It also reflected concerns by the Chinese government that Tibet activists might try to disrupt its plans to carry the Olympic torch up the world&#x27;s tallest peak.

The originally proposed route would have taken the torch through Taipei after leaving Vietnam and before heading for Hong Kong. However, the government of Taiwan (then led by the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party) objected to this proposal, claiming that this route would make the portion of the relay in Taiwan appear to be part of the torch&#x27;s domestic journey through China, rather than a leg on the international route. This dispute, as well as Chinese demands that the flag and the national anthem of the Republic of China be banned along the route led the government of Taiwan to reject the proposal that it be part of the relay route. The two sides of the Taiwan Strait subsequently blamed each other for injecting politics into the event.

== The Games ==
=== Participating National Olympic Committees ===

All but one of the 205 recognized National Olympic Committees (NOCs) that existed participated in the 2008 Summer Olympics, the exception being Brunei. Three countries participated in the Olympic Games for their first time: the Marshall Islands, Montenegro and Tuvalu.

While not a full member recognized by the IOC and thus not allowed to compete formally in the Olympics, the Macau Sports and Olympic Committee sent a delegation to participate in the Wushu Tournament Beijing 2008, being the only unrecognized National Olympic Committee to have taken part in the 2008 Summer Olympics. It also coordinated efforts with the Chinese Olympic Committee to organize the torch relay through Macau.

The Marshall Islands and Tuvalu gained National Olympic Committee status in 2006 and 2007 respectively, and 2008 was the first Games in which they were eligible to participate. The states of Serbia and Montenegro, which participated at the 2004 Games jointly as Serbia and Montenegro, competed separately for the first time since Serbia last participated in 1912. Montenegro made its debut appearance, as the Montenegrin Olympic Committee was accepted as a new National Olympic Committee in 2007. Neighboring Kosovo, however, did not participate. After the declaration of independence in Kosovo, the IOC specified requirements that Kosovo needs to meet before being recognized by the IOC; most notably, it has to be recognized as independent by the United Nations. However, it has since been recognised by the IOC in 2014 without fulfilling these criteria and made its debut in the 2016 games.

More than 100 sovereigns, heads of state and heads of government as well as 170 Ministers of Sport attended the Beijing Olympic Games.

=== Number of athletes by National Olympic Committees ===
==== National participation changes ====

Athletes from the Republic of China (Taiwan) competed at the 2008 Games as Chinese Taipei (TPE) under the Chinese Taipei Olympic flag and used the National Banner Song as their official anthem. The participation of Taiwan was briefly in doubt because of disagreements over the name of their team in the Chinese language and concerns about Taiwan marching in the Opening Ceremony next to the special administrative region of Hong Kong. A compromise based at the Nagoya Protocol about the naming was reached some months before the opening ceremonies, and Taiwan was referred to during the Games as &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot;, rather than &quot;Taipei, China,&quot; as the mainland China government had proposed. In addition, the Central African Republic was placed between Taipei and Hong Kong,China on protocol order.

Starting in 2005, North Korea and South Korea held meetings to discuss the possibility of sending a united team to the 2008 Olympics. The proposal failed, because of disagreements about how athletes would be chosen; North Korea was demanding a certain percentage representation for its athletes. A subsequent attempt to broker an agreement for the two nations to walk together during the March of Nations failed as well, despite their having done so during the 2000 and 2004 Games.

On 24 July 2008, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) banned Iraq from competing in the 2008 Olympic Summer Games because of &quot;political interference by the government in sports.&quot; The IOC reversed its decision five days later and allowed the nation to compete after a pledge by Iraq to ensure &quot;the independence of its national Olympics panel&quot; by instituting fair elections before the end of November. In the meantime, Iraq&#x27;s Olympic Organization was to be run by &quot;an interim committee proposed by its national sports federations and approved by the IOC.&quot;
Brunei Darussalam was due to take part in the 2008 Summer Olympic Games. However, they were disqualified on 8 August, having failed to register either of their two athletes. The IOC spokeswoman Emmanuelle Moreau said in a statement that &quot;it is a great shame and very sad for the athletes who lose out because of the decision by their team not to register them. The IOC tried up until the last minute, midday Friday 8 August 2008, the day of the official opening, to have them register, but to no avail.&quot; Brunei&#x27;s Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports issued a press release stating that their decision not to participate was due to an injury to one of their athletes.

Georgia announced on 9 August 2008, that it was considering withdrawing from the Beijing Olympic Games because of the 2008 South Ossetia war, but it went on to compete while the conflict was still ongoing.

==== Participation of athletes with disabilities ====
South African swimmer Natalie du Toit, whose left leg was amputated following a motor scooter accident, qualified to compete at the Beijing Olympics. The five time gold medalist at the Athens Paralympics in 2004 made history by becoming the first amputee to qualify for the Olympic Games since Olivér Halassy in 1936. She was able to compete in the Olympics rather than the Paralympics because she does not use a prosthetic leg while swimming. Polish athlete Natalia Partyka, who was born without a right forearm, competed in Table Tennis in the 2008 Summer Olympics and 2008 Paralympic Games.

=== Sports ===
The program for the Beijing Games was quite similar to that of the 2004 Summer Olympics held in Athens. There were 28 sports and 302 events at the 2008 Games. Nine new events were held, including two from the new cycling discipline of BMX. Women competed in the steeplechase for the first time. Open water swimming events for men and women, over the distance of , were added to the swimming discipline. Team events (men and women) in table tennis replaced the doubles events. In fencing, the women&#x27;s team foil and women&#x27;s team saber replaced men&#x27;s team foil and women&#x27;s team épée. Two sports were open only to men, baseball and boxing, while one sport and one discipline were open only to women, softball and synchronized swimming. Equestrian and mixed badminton are the only sports in which men and women compete together, although three events in the Sailing allowed the opportunity for both males and female participants. However, only male participants took part in all three events.

The following were the 302 events in 28 sports that were contested at the Games. The number of events contested in each sport is indicated in parentheses (in sports with more than one discipline, as identified by the IOC, these are also specified).


In addition to the official Olympic sports, the Beijing Organizing Committee was given special dispensation by the IOC to run a wushu competition in tandem with the Games. The 2008 Beijing Wushu Tournament saw 128 athletes from 43 countries participate, with medals awarded in 15 separate events; however, these were not to be added to the official medal tally since Wushu was not on the official program of the 2008 Summer Olympics.

=== Calendar ===
In the following calendar for the 2008 Summer Olympics, each blue box represents an event competition, such as a qualification round, on that day. The yellow boxes represent days during which medal-awarding finals for a sport were held. Each bullet in these boxes is an event final, the number of bullets per box representing the number of finals that were contested on that day. On the left, the calendar lists each sport with events held during the Games, and at the right how many gold medals were won in that sport. There is a key at the top of the calendar to aid the reader.
=== Records ===

125 Olympic records including 37 world records were set in various events at the Games. In swimming, sixty-five Olympic swimming records including 25 world records were broken because of the use of the LZR Racer, a specialized swimming suit developed by NASA and the Australian Institute of Sport. Only two swimming Olympic records remained intact after the Games.

=== Opening ceremony ===
Before the event started, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy Band performed the &quot;Welcome March&quot; song as delegations of both IOC and the Chinese government, led by Jacques Rogge and Hu Jintao, entered Beijing National Stadium (The &quot;Bird&#x27;s Nest&quot;). The opening ceremony officially began at 8:00 pm China Standard Time (UTC+8) on 8 August 2008. The number 8 is associated with prosperity and confidence in Chinese culture, and the ceremonial start comprised a triple eight for the date and one extra for time (close to 08:08:08 pm). The ceremony was co-directed by Chinese filmmaker Zhang Yimou and Chinese choreographer Zhang Jigang and featured a cast of over 15,000 performers. The ceremony lasted over four hours and was reported to have cost over US$100 million to produce. UNGA President Miguel d&#x27;Escoto and leaders from 105 countries and territories attended this ceremony.

A rich showcase of ancient Chinese art and culture dominated the ceremony cultural segments. It opened with the beating of Fou drums for the countdown. Subsequently, a giant scroll was unveiled and became the show&#x27;s centerpiece. The official song of the 2008 Summer Olympics, titled &quot;You and Me&quot;, was performed by Britain&#x27;s Sarah Brightman and China&#x27;s Liu Huan, on a large spinning rendition of the globe. As the Olympic Charter determines the parade of nations section, is led by the Greek team, which hosted the previous games, entered first in honour of its status as the Olympic birthplace. They were led by judoka Ilias Iliadis. Meanwhile, the Chinese team entered last as the host country, led by the NBA&#x27;s Houston Rockets superstar Yao Ming and earthquake survivor Lin Hao, who was just 9 years old. The last torchbearer in the Olympic Torch was the gymnast legend Li Ning ignited the cauldron, after being suspended into the air by wires and completing the relay last 400m of the National Stadium at roof height.


The opening ceremony was lauded by spectators and various international presses as &quot;spectacular&quot; and &quot;spellbinding&quot;. Hein Verbruggen, chairman of the IOC Coordination Commission for the XXIX Olympiad, called the ceremony &quot;a grand, unprecedented success.&quot;

=== Closing ceremony ===
The 2008 Summer Olympics Closing Ceremony concluded the Beijing Games on 24 August 2008. It began at 8:00 pm China Standard Time (UTC+8) and took place at the Beijing National Stadium.

The Ceremony included the handover of the Games from Beijing to London. Guo Jinlong, the Mayor of Beijing handed over the Olympic flag to the Mayor of London Boris Johnson, followed by a performance organized by London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. This presentation included performances by guitarist Jimmy Page and recording artist Leona Lewis. Footballer David Beckham was also featured during London&#x27;s presentation.

== Medal table ==

Of the 204 nations that participated in the 2008 Games, 87 earned medals and 54 of those won at least one gold medal, both of these figures setting new records for Olympic Games. There were 117 participating countries that did not win any medals. Athletes from China won the highest number of gold medals of any nation at these Games, with 48, thus making China the seventh nation to rank top in the medal table in the history of the modern Olympics, along with the United States (fifteen times), France (in 1900), Great Britain (in 1908), Germany (in 1936), the Soviet Union (six times), and the Unified Team (in 1992).

The United States team won the most medals overall, with 112. Afghanistan, Mauritius, Sudan, Tajikistan and Togo won their first Olympic medals. Mongolia (which previously held the record for most medals without a gold) and Panama won their first gold medals. Four members of the water polo team from Serbia won the first medal for their country under its new name, having previously won medals representing Yugoslavia and Serbia and Montenegro.
American swimmer Michael Phelps won a total of eight gold medals, more than any other athlete in a single Olympic Games, setting numerous world and Olympic records in the process. Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt also set records in several different events, completing the 100m final with a time of 9.69 seconds, beating his own previous world record. Gymnast Nastia Liukin won the all-around gold medal in artistic gymnastics, becoming the third American female to do so, following in the footsteps of Mary Lou Retton in 1984 and Carly Patterson in 2004.

These are the top ten nations that won medals in the 2008 Games

===Podium sweeps===
== Concerns and controversies ==

A variety of concerns over the Games, or China&#x27;s hosting of the Games, had been expressed by various entities, including claims that China violated its pledge to allow open media access, various claims of human rights violations, its alleged continuous support of repressive regimes (such as Zimbabwe, Myanmar, Sudan, and North Korea), air pollution in both the city of Beijing and environs, proposed boycotts, warnings of the possibility that the Beijing Olympics could be targeted by terrorist groups, disruption from Tibetan separatist protesters, and religious persecutions.

There were also claims that several members of China&#x27;s women&#x27;s gymnastics team, including double gold medal winner He Kexin, were too young to compete under the International Gymnastics Federation&#x27;s rules for Olympic eligibility, but all were exonerated after an official IOC investigation.

Collectively, the Beijing Olympics are associated with a variety of problematic topics: the ecological impact, residential displacement due to construction, treatment of migrant workers, the government&#x27;s political stance on Tibet, etc. In the lead-up to the Olympics, the government allegedly issued guidelines to the local media for their reporting during the Games: most political issues not directly related to the Olympics were to be downplayed; topics such as pro-Tibetan independence and East Turkestan movements were not to be reported on, as were food safety issues such as &quot;cancer-causing mineral water&quot;. As the 2008 Chinese milk scandal broke in September 2008, there was widespread speculation that China&#x27;s desire for a perfect Games may have been a factor contributing towards the delayed recall of contaminated infant formula.

The 2008 Olympics were hit by a number of doping scandals before and after the Games had commenced. Since seven Russian track and field stars were suspended just before the start of the Games for allegedly tampering with their urine samples, only five of the seven who were due to take part could participate. Eleven Greek weightlifters also failed tests in the run up to the Games and the entire Bulgarian weightlifting team had to withdraw after eleven of their weightlifters also failed tests. A small number of athletes from other nations also failed pre-Games tests.

== Legacy ==

The 2008 Summer Olympics have been generally accepted by the world&#x27;s media as a logistical success. Many of the worst fears about the Games failed to materialize: no terrorists struck Beijing; no athlete protested at the podium (though Swedish wrestler Ara Abrahamian tossed his bronze medal in disgust over judging); and the air quality, despite being the worst in Olympics history, was not as bad as many had feared beforehand – due largely to favorable weather patterns.

Many in China viewed the Olympics as &quot;an affirmation of a single nationalistic dream&quot; and saw protests during the international torch relay as an insult to China. The Games also bolstered domestic support for the Chinese government, and for the policies of the Communist Party, giving rise to concerns that the Olympics would give the state more leverage to suppress political dissent, at least temporarily. Efforts to quell any unrest before and during the Games also contributed to a rapid expansion in the size and political clout of China&#x27;s internal security forces, and this growth continued through the following years. Reports also indicated that the Olympics boosted the political careers of pro-Beijing politicians in Hong Kong, as many Chinese gold medal winners campaigned on behalf of the pro-Beijing DAB during the 2008 election, although any trend towards greater identification by Hong Kongers with mainland China appears to have been short-lived.

Some sectors of the Beijing economy may have benefited from the influx of tourists. Other sectors such as manufacturing lost revenue because of plant closings related to the government&#x27;s efforts to improve air quality. Four years after the Games, many of the specially constructed facilities were underused or even deserted. It is generally expected by economists that there will be no lasting effects on Beijing&#x27;s economy from the Games.

<doc id="77746" wikidata="Q666697" url="?curid=77746" title="Primal Scream">
<text>Primal Scream are a Scottish rock band originally formed in 1982 in Glasgow by Bobby Gillespie (vocals) and Jim Beattie (guitar). The band&#x27;s current lineup consists of Gillespie, Andrew Innes (guitar), Simone Butler (bass), and Darrin Mooney (drums).

Primal Scream had been performing live from 1982 to 1984, but their career did not take off until Gillespie left his position as drummer of The Jesus and Mary Chain. The band were a key part of the mid-1980s indie pop scene, but eventually moved away from their jangly sound, taking on more psychedelic and garage rock influences, before incorporating a dance music element to their sound with their 1991 album &quot;Screamadelica&quot;, which broke them into the mainstream. The band have continued to explore different styles on subsequent albums, experimenting with blues, trip hop and industrial rock. Their most recent album, &quot;Come Ahead&quot;, was released on 8 November 2024.

==History==
===Formation and early years (1982–1984)===
Bobby Gillespie moved to Mount Florida in southeastern Glasgow, where he attended King&#x27;s Park Secondary School, where he first met Robert Young. Another schoolfriend was Alan McGee, who took Gillespie to see his first concert, Thin Lizzy. McGee and Gillespie were heavily influenced by punk rock, and they joined a local punk band, the Drains, in 1978. The Drains&#x27; guitarist was a 15-year-old Andrew Innes. The band was short-lived, and Innes and McGee moved to London while Gillespie chose to remain in Glasgow.

After the punk movement ended, Gillespie became disenchanted with mainstream new wave music. He met another schoolfriend who shared his outlook, Jim Beattie, and they recorded &quot;elemental noise tapes&quot;, in which Gillespie would bang two dustbin lids together and Beattie played fuzz-guitar. They soon moved on to the Velvet Underground and the Byrds cover songs before starting to write their own songs, based on Jah Wobble and Peter Hook basslines. Gillespie later said that the band &quot;didn&#x27;t really exist, but we did it every night for something to do.&quot; They named themselves Primal Scream, a term for a type of cry heard in primal therapy. Still essentially a partnership, Primal Scream first played live in 1982.

===First recordings, &quot;Sonic Flower Groove&quot; and &quot;Primal Scream&quot; (1984–1989)===
Their first recording session, for McGee&#x27;s independent label Essential Records, produced a single track entitled &quot;The Orchard&quot;, with Judith Boyle on vocals. Beattie later claimed that they burned the master tape. After the aborted recording, Gillespie joined the Jesus and Mary Chain as their drummer, and alternated between the two bands. While the Jesus and Mary Chain became notorious for their chaotic gigs, Gillespie and Beattie expanded Primal Scream&#x27;s lineup to include schoolfriend Young on bass, rhythm guitarist Stuart May, drummer Tom McGurk, and tambourine player Martin St. John. This lineup was signed to Creation Records, an independent record label founded by Alan McGee, and recorded the group&#x27;s debut single, &quot;All Fall Down&quot;, which received positive reviews.

After the release of the single, Gillespie was told by the Jesus and Mary Chain leaders William and Jim Reid that he was to either dissolve Primal Scream to join their band full-time or resign. Gillespie chose to remain with Primal Scream. Stuart May was replaced by Paul Harte, and the group released a new single, &quot;Crystal Crescent&quot;. Its B-side, &quot;Velocity Girl&quot;, was released on the &quot;C86&quot; compilation, which led to their being associated with the scene of the same name. the band strongly disliked this, Gillespie saying that other groups in that scene &quot;can&#x27;t play their instruments and they can&#x27;t write songs.&quot;

The band toured throughout 1986, and Gillespie became disenchanted with the quality of their performances. He said that there &quot;was always something missing, musically or in attitude.&quot; They switched to McGee&#x27;s newly set-up Warner Bros. subsidiary Elevation Records. Before the band entered Rockfield Studios in Wales to record their debut album, McGurk was asked to leave. The group subsequently began recording using session players. They spent four weeks recording with producer Stephen Street before deciding to halt the sessions.

May was subsequently dismissed; Gillespie&#x27;s former bandmate Innes was brought in as his replacement, and the band found a new drummer, Gavin Skinner. With their new lineup, the band re-entered the studio, this time in London with producer Mayo Thompson. By the time &quot;Sonic Flower Groove&quot; was completed, it had cost £100,000. The album reached number 62 on the British charts and received poor reviews, with AllMusic calling it &quot;pristine but dull.&quot; The backlash from the album caused internal strife within the band. Beattie and Skinner subsequently resigned.

The band, now consisting of Gillespie, Innes and Young, relocated to Brighton to regroup. Young switched to guitar, and they recruited bassist Henry Olsen and drummer Phillip &quot;Toby&quot; Tomanov, who had both been in Nico&#x27;s backing band, the Faction. They traded in their jangle pop sound for a harder rock edge, or as Gillespie said, &quot;[w]e had found rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll.&quot; The band re-signed to Creation Records and released their first single in two years, &quot;Ivy, Ivy, Ivy&quot;. This was followed by a full album, &quot;Primal Scream&quot;. The band&#x27;s new sound was met with poor reviews, &quot;NME&quot; called it &quot;confused and lacking in cohesion&quot;. Fans responded as unfavourably as the critics, with many of the old fans being disappointed or simply confused by the new sound. Both &quot;Sonic Flower Groove&quot; and &quot;Primal Scream&quot; featured contributions from Felt keyboardist Martin Duffy.

===&quot;Screamadelica&quot; (1990–1992)===

The band were first introduced to the acid house scene by McGee in 1988. They were at first sceptical; Gillespie said: &quot;I always remember being quite fascinated by it but not quite getting it.&quot; The band developed a taste for it and began attending raves. The band met up with DJ Andrew Weatherall at a rave, and he was given a copy of &quot;I&#x27;m Losing More Than I&#x27;ll Ever Have&quot;, a track from &quot;Primal Scream&quot;, to remix for one of his shows. Weatherall added a drum loop from an Italian bootleg mix of Edie Brickell&#x27;s &quot;What I Am&quot;, a sample of Gillespie singing a line from Robert Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Terraplane Blues&quot; and the central introductory sample from the Peter Fonda B-movie &quot;The Wild Angels&quot;. The resulting track, &quot;Loaded&quot;, became the band&#x27;s first major hit, reaching number 16 on the UK Singles Chart. This was followed by another single, &quot;Come Together&quot;, which reached number 26.
The band entered the studio with Weatherall, Hugo Nicolson, the Orb and Jimmy Miller producing, and Martin Duffy now full-time on keyboards after Felt disbanded. They released two more singles, &quot;Higher Than the Sun&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Fight It, Feel It&quot; which featured the lead vocals of Manchester singer Denise Johnson. The album &quot;Screamadelica&quot; was released in late 1991 to positive reviews. &quot;Ink Blot Magazine&quot; said that the album was &quot;both of its time and timeless.&quot; The album was also a commercial success, reaching number eight on the UK chart. The album won the first Mercury Music Prize, beating Gillespie&#x27;s former band the Jesus and Mary Chain.

The supporting tour kicked off in Amsterdam, and it included a performance at the Glastonbury festival before coming to an end in Sheffield. Throughout the tour the band and their increasingly large entourage gained notoriety for their large narcotic intake. Around this time, the band recorded the &quot;Dixie Narco EP&quot;. Some of the tracks had a more American blues rock sound than previously, and displayed a P-Funk influence.

===&quot;Give Out But Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot; (1992–1995)===
The band began work on their fourth album in Roundhouse Studios in London in September 1992.

In March 1994, the first single from the new album, &quot;Rocks&quot;, was released. It was the band&#x27;s highest-charting single to date, reaching number seven on the UK charts. The single was not received well, with &quot;NME&quot; calling them &quot;dance traitors&quot;. The album &quot;Give Out But Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot; was released in May to mixed reviews. Whereas some praised the band&#x27;s new the Rolling Stones-influenced sound, some dismissed the album as tired and drawing too heavily on their influences. Two more singles were released from the album, &quot;Jailbird&quot; and &quot;(I&#x27;m Gonna) Cry Myself Blind&quot;, both of which charted progressively lower.

While touring in support of the album, relations within the band began to wear down. The band&#x27;s American tour, when they supported Depeche Mode, was, in the words of manager Alex Nightingale, &quot;the closest we&#x27;ve come to the band splitting up.&quot; After the completion of the tour, the band remained quiet for a long period of time. Gillespie later remarked that he was unsure if the band would continue. The only release during this period was a single, &quot;The Big Man and the Scream Team Meet the Barmy Army Uptown&quot;, a collaboration with Irvine Welsh and On-U Sound, which caused controversy due to offensive lyrics about Rangers F.C. and their fan base.

===&quot;Vanishing Point&quot; (1996–1998)===
After a short hiatus, the band returned with a new lineup. Gary &quot;Mani&quot; Mounfield, fresh from the well-publicised break-up of his previous band, the Stone Roses, was added as the band&#x27;s new bassist, and Paul Mulraney was added as their new drummer. The arrival of Mani revitalized the group, who were considering disbanding after the failure of &quot;Give Out&quot;. The album was recorded in the band&#x27;s personal studio in two months, and was mixed in another month. Most of the recording was engineered by Innes, and produced by Brendan Lynch and Andrew Weatherall.

The music on the album had a complex shoegazing dance/dub rhythm, harking back to the crossover success of &quot;Screamadelica&quot;, yet sounding significantly darker. Some songs on the album were inspired by cult 1971 film &quot;Vanishing Point&quot;; Gillespie said that they wanted to create an alternative soundtrack for the film. Other lyrics were inspired by the band&#x27;s past experiences with drug abuse. Gillespie described the album as &quot;an anarcho-syndicalist speedfreak road movie record!&quot; The first single released from the album, &quot;Kowalski&quot;, was released in May 1997, and reached number 8 on the British charts. The album, titled &quot;Vanishing Point&quot; after the film, was released in July and revitalized the band&#x27;s commercial viability. It received almost positive reviews upon release, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; calling it a &quot;swirling, hypnotic acid-trip&quot;, and &quot;Musik&quot; saying that &quot;this group&#x27;s place in the history book of late 20th Century music is assured.&quot; The inclusion on the album of the title track from the film &quot;Trainspotting&quot; also helped cement the band&#x27;s place in alternative modern culture.

The band scheduled a short supporting tour to take place during July. The band had to postpone the dates. This led to speculation that there were problems within the band, and that one of the members may resign. The band&#x27;s press agent issued a statement saying &quot;[i]t&#x27;s not a drugs thing and it&#x27;s not a nervous breakdown.&quot; Before the tour was scheduled to begin, Mulraney left the band and they were forced to use a drum machine. The initial dates were poorly received, but they eventually hired drummer Darrin Mooney and the gigs improved. Throughout the Vanishing Point tour Primal Scream employed the up-and-coming Asian Dub Foundation as a support act, helping them to break into the mainstream.

In February 1998 the band released the &quot;If They Move, Kill &#x27;Em&quot; EP. This notably featured the bands&#x27; first collaboration with Kevin Shields, on his remix of the title track. Later that year, Shields joined the band on tour and would have a major influence on their sound in the next few years. After the release of the album, a collection of alternative mixes/remixes from Vanishing Point were released as the album Echo Dek, with the bulk of mixes done by Adrian Sherwood.

===&quot;XTRMNTR&quot; and &quot;Evil Heat&quot; (1999–2005)===
Recording sessions for the band&#x27;s sixth album went well. The band were for the most part free of drugs, and their lineup had stabilised. Despite their new-found peace, the band pursued a harsher and angrier musical direction. Many of the songs they wrote had overtly political lyrics, Gillespie said the band wished to convey &quot;What it&#x27;s like to be in Britain in this day and age.&quot; The album featured multiple guest appearances, including the Chemical Brothers, New Order&#x27;s Bernard Sumner, and former My Bloody Valentine guitarist Kevin Shields, who had become a semi-permanent member.

The first single from &quot;XTRMNTR&quot;, &quot;Swastika Eyes&quot;, was released in November 1999. The song&#x27;s overtly political content, Gillespie said it was about &quot;American international terrorism&quot;, made it controversial. Nevertheless, it was a hit, charting at No. 22 on the British charts. &quot;XTRMNTR&quot; itself fared well, reaching No. 3. The political content was well received, with Allmusic calling it a &quot;nasty, fierce realization of an entire world that has... lost the plot.&quot;. In 2009 &quot;NME&quot; charted &quot;XTRMNTR&quot; at No. 3 in &quot;The Top 100 Greatest Albums of The Decade&quot;.

In 2000, the band began recording their seventh album, &quot;Evil Heat&quot;, released in 2002. Though the political content was not as strong as the previous album, there was a song originally slated for the album entitled &quot;Bomb the Pentagon&quot;, which was reworked into the song &quot;Rise&quot; after the 11 September attacks. The album, like many of Primal Scream&#x27;s previous albums, had multiple producers. Shields produced several tracks, and Andrew Weatherall produced three tracks, his first work with the band since &quot;Vanishing Point&quot;. Kate Moss sang professionally for the first time with single &quot;Some Velvet Morning&quot;, a version of the Lee Hazlewood/Nancy Sinatra song. The album also featured another guest appearance, Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant. In 2003 the double CD album &quot;Dirty Hits&quot; was released containing the better known works and some previously unheard versions and remixes of those tunes.

In June 2005, Primal Scream played a controversial set at the Glastonbury Festival, throughout which Gillespie was playfully abusive to the crowd and was alleged to have made Nazi salutes during the song &quot;Swastika Eyes&quot;. They were eventually forced off by officials after overrunning their allotted time; the festival organisers were at that point already annoyed at the band when, in response to their invitation to join other recording artists in signing a &quot;Make Poverty History&quot; poster which would be auctioned off for charity, lead singer Bobby Gillespie instead altered the poster so that it read &quot;Make Israel History&quot;. Gillespie later said that this was to show his support for the Palestinian cause.

===&quot;Riot City Blues&quot;, &quot;Beautiful Future&quot; and &quot;Screamadelica&quot; 20th anniversary (2006–2012)===
In an interview with &quot;NME&quot;, Gillespie said that the band had written &quot;euphoric rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll songs&quot; for their next album. They intended to capture the energy of their live performances. The band chose Youth as their producer, which led to speculation that they had fallen out with Shields. Although the band themselves admitted that they were unsure of the situation, Shields subsequently joined them on tour.

The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Country Girl&quot;, was released on 22 May 2006, and regular airplay resulted in a chart entry of number 5, their highest ever. It was also used by the BBC in the closing credits of the Grand National 2007 and as the backing track to a video celebrating the successes of the Scottish racing driver Dario Franchitti in the 2007 Autosport Awards ceremony in London. The album &quot;Riot City Blues&quot; was released in June and reached number five on the UK Album Charts. However, it received mixed reviews: &quot;Pitchfork Media&quot; called it &quot;flat and dead&quot;, while AllMusic called it &quot;a refreshingly retro rock &amp; roll album&quot;.

In support of the album, the band toured the UK, along with selected dates in Europe. The band released their first DVD, &quot;Riot City Blues Tour&quot;, in August 2007. The DVD featured clips of the band&#x27;s performance in London, as well as all their music videos and an interview with Gillespie and Mani.

On 26 August 2006, bassist Mani was arrested at the Leeds music festival, after what was said to be a drunken brawl. However, he was soon released and the band&#x27;s appearance at the festival went ahead. Also around this time, Young left the band to go on sabbatical, failing to appear on their November 2006 UK tour. It was later stated by Bobby Gillespie that Young was unlikely to make a return. He was temporarily replaced by Barrie Cadogan of Little Barrie. Young died in September 2014.

After touring &quot;Screamadelica&quot; for most of 2011, on 18 October Gary Mounfield revealed he had left the band due to the reformation of his original band the Stone Roses. Debbie Googe (of My Bloody Valentine) was announced as his replacement. Simone Butler would join the band as bassist in 2012.

Primal Scream supported the Stone Roses at their Heaton Park concert in Manchester on 29 June 2012.

===&quot;More Light&quot; and &quot;Chaosmosis&quot; (2013–2018)===
The band&#x27;s tenth album, &quot;More Light&quot;, was released in May 2013 on the band&#x27;s own label, First International, via Ignition Records. The new album was produced by David Holmes, who confirmed the release on his Facebook page on 11 January 2013. The first track taken from the album is &quot;2013&quot; with a music video directed by Rei Nadal. The first single proper is &quot;It&#x27;s Alright, It&#x27;s OK&quot;, which was played in the UK by both BBC Radio 2 and 6 Music, as well as supported by leading alternative music stations XFM and Absolute Radio. It also appears on the soundtrack for &quot;Freaks of Nature&quot; (2015), playing over the final scene and end credits. The second single is &quot;Invisible City&quot;.

Former guitarist Robert &quot;Throb&quot; Young died in September 2014.

Their eleventh album &quot;Chaosmosis&quot; was released on 18 March 2016.

In August 2018 it was announced that the band would release the original long-lost recordings made for &quot;Give Out But Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot; for the first time, which were made when the band went to Memphis&#x27;s Ardent Studios in 1993 to work on a new album with producer Tom Dowd and the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section.

===&quot;Maximum Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll: The Singles&quot; and &quot;Come Ahead&quot; (2019–present)===
On 24 May 2019 the band released a third compilation album, &quot;Maximum Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll: The Singles&quot;. The album contains seventeen tracks spanning the period from 1986 till 2016.

In 2022 Primal Scream played at the Victorious Festival in Portsmouth. In April, the band sold song rights of fifty percent of their back catalogue to BMG. The deal involved Gillespie, Innes and the estate of Robert Young. 

Martin Duffy died in December 2022 at the age of 55. Following his death, Duffy&#x27;s son, Louie, made a statement at his father&#x27;s inquest. Louie claimed that despite playing with the band for over 30 years, he was paid only as a session musician. 

On 23 May 2023, Primal Scream announced that they would be performing as a 12-piece band for their upcoming tour dates, with the core line-up augmented by members of the House Gospel Choir on backing vocals, Alex White of Fat White Family on saxophone, and keyboards by former Go-Kart Mozart member Terry Miles who had also previously played with the band in Martin Duffy&#x27;s absence.

The band released the single &quot;Love Insurrection&quot; in July 2024 and simultaneously announced their twelfth studio album &quot;Come Ahead&quot; for release on 8 November 2024.

The band features in the book &quot;Postcards from Scotland&quot; detailing the 1980s and 1990s independent music scene in Scotland.

<doc id="77747" wikidata="Q1811390" url="?curid=77747" title="We Can Remember It for You Wholesale">
<text>&quot;We Can Remember It for You Wholesale&quot; is a science fiction novelette by American writer Philip K. Dick, first published in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot; in April 1966. It features a melding of reality, false memory, and real memory. The story was adapted into the 1990 film &quot;Total Recall&quot; with Arnold Schwarzenegger as the story&#x27;s protagonist; that film was remade in 2012 with Colin Farrell as the protagonist.

==Synopsis==
Douglas Quail works a menial office job in the &quot;not too distant future.&quot; His biggest dream has always been to visit Mars but he is constantly dissuaded by his wife. Quail eventually discovers Rekal Incorporated, where he goes to receive memory implants of having traveled to Mars. To the shock of the Rekal technicians, under sedation, Quail somehow regains erased memories of who he really is. Quail&#x27;s memories reveal that he really is a secret agent who has been to Mars.

The Rekal representative, McClane, refunds half of Quail&#x27;s money and sends him home. Quail thinks that the operation was a failure because his memories are blurry, and he remembers his trip to the office to get the procedure done. He returns home still believing the memories are fake but discovers a box of fauna smuggled from Mars in his desk. He confronts his wife about whether or not he has actually been to Mars, and she angrily leaves him. Two armed men suddenly enter and reveal that Quail has a telepathic transmitter in his head that allows them to read his thoughts. Through this interaction, Quail suddenly remembers why he had his memories erased: Quail wasn&#x27;t just a secret agent, he was an assassin who killed a political opponent for Earth&#x27;s government.

With his memories returned, the armed men try to kill Quail, but Quail, with his abilities awakened as well, fights them off and escapes. Wondering what to do, Quail contacts his former commanders through the telepathic transmitter. Quail suggests going through another mind-wipe, but this time replacing his current awareness of being an assassin with the pleasant memory of an exciting life. His commanders agree, feeling that it is their obligation to help their former agent.

Quail turns himself in and is placed with a psychiatrist to figure out what his own personal desires are. When he was young, Quail used to fantasize that as a child he came across minuscule rodent-like aliens that were going to launch a full invasion of Earth with their superior technology. However, young Quail was so kind to and accepting of the aliens that they decided to hold off on their invasion as long as he was alive. While finding the fantasy narcissistic, his commanders agree to plant the memories at Rekal. To everyone&#x27;s shock, those memories turn out to be real as well.

While the owners of Carolco had licensed the story from Dick for the 1990 version, the 2012 film was largely based on the original and does not credit Dick as a writer. Both films include the main concepts of Dick&#x27;s story but contain many alterations.

<text>What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? is an American psychological horror novel by Henry Farrell published in 1960 by Rinehart &amp; Company. The novel has earned a cult following, and has been adapted for the screen twice, in 1962 and 1991.

==Plot==
This Gothic story deals with two sisters, Jane and Blanche Hudson, who are living alone together in a decaying Hollywood mansion. A former child star of early vaudeville known as &quot;Baby Jane&quot;, Jane was doted upon by her father due to her success on the stage while Blanche lived in her shadow, neglected. However, their roles were reversed after the death of their parents; both children moved to Los Angeles to live with an aunt. Blanche was favored by directors for her blonde hair and regal beauty, and finally decided to pursue a successful film career. Blanche became a star, while a string of flops cost Jane her fame and popularity. Blanche managed to keep her sister&#x27;s career alive by having a clause in her contract stipulating that Jane have a role in every film in which Blanche appeared, but these were always minor parts that relegated Jane to the same neglect Blanche had suffered.

The story then shifts to the present, where Jane, who still dresses as if she were 10 years old, and Blanche, disabled after a mysterious car accident, are now aging spinsters living in Blanche&#x27;s crumbling estate. Jane resents how her career has been all but forgotten compared to Blanche&#x27;s (who became more famous than she ever was, and who is now being remembered because of a revival of her films on television), and hates having to cook, clean and care for her sister. Although stuck upstairs in her bedroom, Blanche has managed to keep her good looks while Jane&#x27;s appearance is ravaged by years of alcoholism.

Blanche, whose only other contact with the outside world is Edna Stitt, the mansion&#x27;s cleaning woman, and the telephone conversations she occasionally has with her doctor and attorney, realizes that Jane is becoming increasingly unstable. She calls her lawyer and tells him that she is planning to sell the house. Jane, who eavesdrops on her sister&#x27;s calls, believes that Blanche intends to have her committed to a mental hospital. Blanche becomes aware of her sister&#x27;s sinister mood swings and tries to explain her decision, but Jane simply ignores her. Soon, Jane begins to exhibit signs of insanity. She removes the phone from Blanche&#x27;s room and makes her afraid to eat by killing and cooking her pet bird, and later, a large rat from the cellar. In a drunken daze, Jane decides to resurrect her old Baby Jane stage act, reasoning that Fanny Brice had success with Baby Snooks. She hires Edwin Flagg, an accompanist, through a help wanted ad.

As reality topples crazily into eerie fantasy, Jane begins to abuse her sister with monstrous cruelty and embezzles her money to buy liquor and finance her comeback. Edna becomes uneasy when she is unable to reach Blanche on the phone and Jane refuses to let her clean her sister&#x27;s room. Opening the door to find Blanche tied to the bed with her mouth taped shut, she tries to help, but Jane sneaks up and kills Edna with a hammer. That night, Jane dumps the body. A day or two later, police officers ask questions to Jane about Edna&#x27;s disappearance. Jane goes into a panic, grabs her barely conscious sister, and heads for the location of some of her happier childhood memories: the beach where she and her father used to practice her song-and-dance routine while crowds of onlookers watched. Jane plays in the sand, and Blanche lies weak and on the verge of death from starvation and abuse.

Realizing that she may be dying, Blanche reveals to Jane that it was she, not Jane, who was responsible for paralyzing her. After Jane humiliated Blanche at a party years earlier, her sister tried to run her over before Jane got out of the way. The car then slammed into a metal gate, snapping Blanche&#x27;s spine. She managed to crawl out of the car to the gates, and Jane, frightened and drunk, hid inside the house, where she passed out. When the police arrived, they assumed that Jane had been driving. Blanche later realized that the event had driven her sister insane with guilt, but refused to allow her to seek psychiatric help for fear that Jane might recover enough to remember what really happened and then would leave her. Realizing that all the years of hatred and resentment between the sisters could have been avoided, Jane forgives Blanche.

Jane calls the police and tells them that her sister is very sick. Outside the phone booth, three officers recognize her and gently take Jane back to the beach. They start to question her and ask her where her sister is. At first, Jane vaguely tells them where to find Blanche, leading them to the beach. She then becomes confused and ignores their questions. Upon mentioning the name &quot;Miss Hudson&quot;, Jane is taken to her vaudeville days, and she begins to dance &quot;very prettily&quot; despite the police&#x27;s imploring her to tell them where Blanche is. The novel ends with Jane&#x27;s dancing but does not reveal if Blanche survives or not.

==1962 film==

&quot;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot; is a 1962 American psychological thriller-horror film film produced and directed by Robert Aldrich, starring Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, about an aging actress who holds her paraplegic sister captive in an old Hollywood mansion, with screenplay adapted by Lukas Heller. Upon the film&#x27;s release, it was met with widespread critical and box-office acclaim, and was nominated for five Academy Awards, winning one for Best Costume Design, Black and White.

The intensely bitter Hollywood rivalry between Davis and Crawford, the film&#x27;s two stars, was heavily important to the film&#x27;s initial success. This in part led to the revitalization of the then-waning careers of the two stars. In the years after release, critics continued to acclaim the film for its psychologically driven black comedy, camp, and creation of the psycho-biddy subgenre. The film&#x27;s then-unheard of and controversial plot meant that it originally received an X rating in the UK.

==1991 film==

&quot;What Ever Happened to...&quot; is a 1991 American TV movie directed by David Greene and adapted for the small screen by Brian Taggert, based on the novel &quot;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot; by Henry Farrell and the 1962 theatrical film of the same name. It stars real-life sisters Lynn Redgrave as Baby Jane Hudson and Vanessa Redgrave as Blanche Hudson in the roles previously played by Bette Davis and Joan Crawford in the 1962 adaptation.

The film was adapted to contemporary times, with Blanche&#x27;s film success taking place in the 1960s instead of the 1930s. Her films were being rediscovered on home video instead of television reruns. Jane had been a child film star (replacing the original&#x27;s vaudeville success), but her films were unavailable, leading to her jealousy.

<doc id="77750" wikidata="Q2721171" url="?curid=77750" title="Law of the United Kingdom">
<text>The United Kingdom has three distinctly different legal systems, each of which derives from a particular geographical area for a variety of historical reasons: English law (in the joint jurisdiction of England and Wales), Scots law, Northern Ireland law, and, since 2007, calls for a fourth type, that of purely Welsh law as a result of Welsh devolution, with further calls for a Welsh justice system.

In fulfilment of its former EU treaty obligations, European Union directives had been transposed into the UK legal system on an ongoing basis by the UK parliament. Upon Brexit, non-transposed EU law (such as regulations) was transplanted into domestic law as &quot;retained EU law&quot;, with an additional period of alignment with EU law during the transition period from 31 January to 31 December 2020.

== Legal jurisdictions ==

There are three distinct legal jurisdictions in the United Kingdom: England and Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Each has its own legal system, distinct history and origins, although there is a substantial overlap between these three legal systems and the three legal jurisdictions.

Unlike the other three, Welsh law is not a separate legal system , merely the primary and secondary legislation generated by the Senedd, interpreted in accordance with the doctrines of English law and not impacting upon English common law (except where such Welsh legislation ousts a common law rule by virtue of being a superior form of law).

The UK does not have a single legal system because it was created by the political union of previously independent countries. Article 19 of the Treaty of Union, put into effect by the Acts of Union in 1707, created the Kingdom of Great Britain but guaranteed the continued existence of Scotland&#x27;s and England&#x27;s separate legal systems. The Acts of Union of 1800, which joined Great Britain and Ireland into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, contained no equivalent provisions but preserved the principle of different courts to be held in Ireland, of which the part called Northern Ireland continues to follow as part of the United Kingdom.

Each legal system defaults to its jurisdiction, each of whose courts further that law through jurisprudence. Choice of which jurisdiction&#x27;s law to use is possible in private law: for example, a company in Edinburgh, Scotland and a company in Belfast, Northern Ireland are free to contract using English law. This is not so in public law (for example, criminal law), where there are set rules of procedure in each jurisdiction.

=== Structure and history ===
Although Scotland and Northern Ireland form part of the United Kingdom and share Westminster as a primary legislature, they have separate legal systems. (Even though Scotland became part of the UK over 300 years ago, Scots law has remained remarkably distinct from English law). The UK&#x27;s highest civil appeal court is the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, whose decisions are binding on all three UK jurisdictions, as in &quot;Donoghue v Stevenson&quot;, a Scots case that forms the basis of the UK&#x27;s law of negligence.

&quot;Great Britain&quot; means England, Wales, Scotland, their adjacent territorial waters and the islands of Orkney and Shetland, the Hebrides and, by virtue of the Island of Rockall Act 1972, Rockall. &quot;United Kingdom&quot; means Great Britain and Northern Ireland and their adjacent territorial waters, but not the Isle of Man, nor the Channel Islands, whose independent status was discussed in &quot;Rover International Ltd. v Canon Film Sales Ltd.&quot; (1987) and &quot;Chloride Industrial Batteries Ltd. v F. &amp; W. Freight Ltd.&quot; (1989). &quot;British Islands&quot;but not &quot;British Isles&quot;means the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.

The first schedule of the Interpretation Act 1978, defines the following terms: &quot;British Islands&quot;, &quot;England&quot;, and &quot;United Kingdom&quot;. The use of the term &quot;British Isles&quot; is virtually obsolete in statutes and, when it does appear, it is taken to be synonymous with &quot;British Islands&quot;. For interpretation purposes, England includes a number of specified elements:
* Wales and Berwick Act 1746, section 3 (entire act now repealed) formally incorporated Wales and Berwick-upon-Tweed into England. But section 4 Welsh Language Act 1967 provided that references to England in future acts of Parliament should no longer include Wales (see now Interpretation Act 1978, schedule 3, part 1). But Dicey &amp; Morris say (at p28) &quot;It seems desirable to adhere to Dicey&#x27;s (the original) definition for reasons of convenience and especially of brevity. It would be cumbersome to have to add &quot;or Wales&quot; after &quot;England&quot; and &quot;or Welsh&quot; after &quot;English&quot; every time those words are used.&quot;
* the &quot;adjacent islands&quot; of the Isle of Wight and Anglesey are a part of England and Wales by custom, while &quot;Harman v Bolt&quot; (1931) expressly confirms that Lundy is a part of England.
* the &quot;adjacent territorial waters&quot; by virtue of the Territorial Waters Jurisdiction Act 1878 and the Continental Shelf Act 1964 as amended by the Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act 1982.

===England And Wales===
&quot;English and Welsh law&quot; (or just &quot;English law&quot;) refers to the legal system administered by the courts in England and Wales, which rule on both civil and criminal matters. English and Welsh law is based on the principles of common law. English and Welsh law can be described as having its own legal doctrine, distinct from civil law legal systems since 1189.

There has been no major codification of the law, rather the law is developed by judges in court, applying statute, precedent and case-by-case reasoning to give explanatory judgments of the relevant legal principles. These judgments are binding in future similar cases (&quot;stare decisis&quot;), and for this reason are often reported in law reports.

The courts of England and Wales are headed by the Senior Courts of England and Wales, consisting of the Court of Appeal, the High Court of Justice (for civil cases) and the Crown Court (for criminal cases). The Supreme Court is the highest court in the land for both criminal and civil appeal cases in England and Wales (also in Northern Ireland cases and civil cases in Scots law) and any decision it makes is binding on every other court in the same jurisdiction, and often has persuasive effect in its other jurisdictions.

On appeal, a court may overrule the decisions of its inferior courts, such as county courts (civil) and magistrates&#x27; courts (criminal). The High Court may also quash on judicial review both administrative decisions of the Government and delegated legislation. Before the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom was created in October 2009, the highest appellate body was the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords, usually just referred to as &quot;The House of Lords&quot;.

After the Acts of Union, in 1707 English law became one of two legal systems in different parts of the same United Kingdom and has been influenced by Scots law, most notably in the development and integration of the law merchant by Lord Mansfield and in time the development of the law of negligence. Scottish influence may have influenced the abolition of the forms of action in the nineteenth century and extensive procedural reforms in the twentieth. Since the accession of the United Kingdom to the European Communities in 1973, English law has also been affected by European law under the Treaty of Rome.

==== Wales ====
Welsh law is the primary and secondary legislation generated by the Senedd, using the devolved authority granted in the Government of Wales Act 2006, amended substantially by Wales Act 2014 and Wales Act 2017, and in effect since May 2007. Each piece of Welsh legislation is known as an Act of Senedd Cymru.

As there is no criminal law within contemporary Welsh law, Wales is not generally considered a fourth jurisdiction of the United Kingdom. This is because the judiciary and the courts follow England and Wales law, which is made by the Parliament at Westminster, and is not specific to Wales. Although Welsh law is recognised as separate in operation, this is not sufficient for Wales to constitute a separate legal jurisdiction.

A commission set up in 2017 by the First Minister of Wales known as &quot;The Commission on Justice in Wales&quot; and chaired by Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, looked into the operation of justice in the country. Its aim was to further clarify the legal and political identity of Wales within the UK constitution. The commission&#x27;s report was released in October 2019 and recommended the full devolution of the justice system. This would formalise Wales as the fourth jurisdiction of the UK.

There have been multiple calls from both academics and politicians however for a Wales criminal justice system.

=== Northern Ireland ===


The law of Northern Ireland is a common law system. It is administered by the courts of Northern Ireland, with ultimate appeal to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in both civil and criminal matters. The law of Northern Ireland is closely similar to English law, the rules of common law having been imported into the Kingdom of Ireland under English rule. However, there are important differences.

The sources of the law of Northern Ireland are Irish common law, and statute law. Of the latter, statutes of the Parliaments of Ireland, of the United Kingdom and of Northern Ireland are in force, and latterly statutes of the devolved Northern Ireland Assembly. The courts of Northern Ireland are headed by the Court of Judicature of Northern Ireland, consisting of the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal, the Northern Ireland High Court of Justice and the Northern Ireland Crown Court.

Below that are county courts and magistrates&#x27; courts. The Supreme Court is the highest court in the land for both criminal and civil appeal cases in Northern Ireland and any decision it makes is binding on every other court in the same jurisdiction and often has persuasive effect in its other jurisdictions.

=== Scotland ===


Scots law is a unique legal system with an ancient basis in Roman law. Grounded in uncodified civil law dating back to the &quot;Corpus Juris Civilis&quot;, it also features elements of common law with medieval sources. Thus Scotland has a pluralistic, or &#x27;mixed&#x27;, legal system, comparable to that of South Africa, and, to a lesser degree, the partly codified pluralistic systems of Louisiana and Quebec.

Since the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain under the 1707 Acts of Union, Scots law has shared a legislature with England and Wales. While each retained fundamentally different legal systems, the 1707 Union brought English and Welsh influence upon Scots law, and vice versa. Since the accession of the United Kingdom to the European Communities in 1973, Scots law has been affected by European law under the Treaty of Rome. The establishment of Scottish Parliament in 1999, which legislates within domestic areas of legislative competence, has created a further major source of Scots law.

Under the UK Withdrawal from the European Union (Continuity) (Scotland) Act 2020 following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union in 2020 it is required that devolved Scots law has to stay in alignment with future EU law despite the virtue of no longer being a member state.

The chief courts are the Court of Session, for civil cases, and the High Court of Justiciary, for criminal cases. The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom serves as the highest court of appeal for civil cases under Scots law, with leave to appeal from the Court of Session not required as a general rule. However, unlike in the rest of the United Kingdom, the Supreme Court has no role as the highest court of appeal for Scottish criminal cases: this is forbidden by Article XIX of the Treaty of Union between Scotland and England.

Sheriff courts deal with most civil and criminal cases including conducting criminal trials with a jury, known as sheriff solemn court, or with a sheriff and no jury, known as sheriff summary court. The sheriff courts provide a local court service with 49 sheriff courts organised across six sheriffdoms. The Scottish legal system is unique in having three possible verdicts for a criminal trial: &quot;guilty&quot;, &quot;not guilty&quot; and &quot;not proven&quot;. Both &quot;not guilty&quot; and &quot;not proven&quot; result in an acquittal with no possibility of retrial.

In very rare circumstances, the High Court of Justiciary can create new criminal offences without reference to Parliament, using its declaratory power to do so.

The Cabinet Secretary for Justice and Home Affairs is the member of the Scottish Government responsible for Police Scotland, the courts and criminal justice, and the Scottish Prison Service, which manages the prisons in Scotland.

==Retained EU law==

Retained EU law (REUL) is a category of law in the United Kingdom created at the end of the transition period following the UK&#x27;s withdrawal from the EU. REUL includes EU legislation which was &quot;cut and pasted&quot; into domestic law, along with certain domestic laws whose role was to implement EU regulations and directives. The objective of REUL is to maintain &quot;legislative continuity&quot;.

==Courts and tribunals==

The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom is the highest court in the UK for all criminal and civil cases in England and Wales and Northern Ireland, and for all civil cases in Scots law. The Supreme Court is the final court, in the normal sense of the term, for interpreting United Kingdom law. Unlike in some other systems, for example, the United States, the Supreme Court cannot strike down statutes. Its precedents can be expressly overridden by Parliament, by virtue of the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty. The Supreme Court came into being in October 2009, replacing the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords.

In England and Wales, the court system is headed by the Senior Courts of England and Wales, consisting of the Court of Appeal, the High Court of Justice (for civil cases) and the Crown Court (for criminal cases). The Courts of Northern Ireland follow the same pattern. 

In Scotland, the chief courts are the Court of Session, for civil cases, and the High Court of Justiciary, for criminal cases. Sheriff courts, as they deal with both criminal and civil caseloads, have no equivalent outside Scotland.

Certain tribunals for administrative law cases have UK-wide jurisdiction, notably those dealing with immigration—the Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) and Special Immigration Appeals Commission—military and national security, competition and intellectual property, and a few others. Similarly, the Employment Appeal Tribunal has jurisdiction throughout Great Britain but not in Northern Ireland.

The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is the highest court of appeal for several independent Commonwealth countries, the British Overseas Territories, and the British Crown Dependencies.

==United Kingdom legislatures==
===United Kingdom Parliament===

The Parliament of the United Kingdom is bicameral, with an upper house - the House of Lords, and a lower house - the House of Commons. In addition to the two houses, the King is also a component of Parliament.

The House of Lords includes two different types of members: The Lords Spiritual (the senior bishops of the Church of England) and the Lords Temporal (members of the Peerage). Its members are not elected by the population at large.

The House of Commons is a democratically elected chamber. The two Houses meet in separate chambers in the Palace of Westminster, commonly known as the &quot;Houses of Parliament&quot;, in the City of Westminster in London. By constitutional convention, all government ministers, including the Prime Minister, are members of the House of Commons or House of Lords.

Parliament evolved from the early medieval councils that advised the sovereigns of England and Scotland. The King, Lords, and Commons acting together to legislate may be described as the King-in-Parliament. The King-in-Parliament is, according to the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty, completely sovereign with the power to make and unmake any law other than to bind itself.

Real power is vested in the House of Commons. The Sovereign acts only as a figurehead and the powers of the House of Lords are greatly limited. The parliament retains some law-making powers for some jurisdictions outside of the United Kingdom proper.

===Northern Ireland Assembly===
The Northern Ireland Assembly (, Ulster Scots: &quot;Norlin Airlann Semmlie&quot;) is the devolved legislature of Northern Ireland. It has power to legislate in a wide range of areas that are not explicitly reserved to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, and to appoint the Northern Ireland Executive. It sits at Parliament Buildings at Stormont in Belfast.

The latest incarnation of the Assembly was established under the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, an accord aimed at bringing an end to Northern Ireland&#x27;s violent 30-year Troubles. It is based on the principle of power-sharing under the D&#x27;Hondt method to ensure that Northern Ireland&#x27;s largest political communities, the unionist and nationalist communities both participate in governing the region.

The Assembly is a unicameral, democratically elected body comprising 90 members who are known as Members of the Legislative Assembly, or MLAs. Members are elected under the single transferable vote form of proportional representation.

===Scottish Parliament===
The Scottish Parliament (; Scots: &quot;Scots Pairlament&quot;) is located in the Holyrood area of the capital Edinburgh. The Parliament, which is informally referred to as &quot;Holyrood&quot; (cf. &quot;Westminster&quot;), is a democratically elected body of 129 members who are known as Members of the Scottish Parliament or MSPs. Members are elected for four-year terms under the Additional Member System of proportional representation.

73 MSPs represent individual geographical constituencies elected by the plurality voting system (&quot;first past the post&quot;). A further 56 are returned from eight additional member regions, each electing seven MSPs. The Scottish Parliament, as it was created by devolution and an act of parliament, does not get its legislative powers by virtue of sovereignty or by virtue of &#x27;being the Scottish Parliament&#x27;. It legally exists as a subset of Westminster and derives its powers as such.

The original Parliament of Scotland (or &quot;Estates of Scotland&quot;) was the national legislature of the independent Kingdom of Scotland and existed from the early thirteenth century until the Kingdom of Scotland merged with the Kingdom of England under the Acts of Union 1707 to form the Kingdom of Great Britain. As a consequence, the Parliament of Scotland merged with the Parliament of England, to form the Parliament of Great Britain, which sat at Westminster in London.

===Senedd===
Since 2007, the Senedd (Welsh Parliament; ), previously known as the &#x27;National Assembly for Wales&#x27;, has been invested with legislative powers. It is situated in Cardiff. The Senedd, first elected in 1999, is a democratically elected body of 60 members who are known as Members of the Senedd or MSs. Members are elected for five-year terms under the Additional Member System of proportional representation. 40 MSs represent individual geographical constituencies elected by the plurality voting system (&quot;first past the post&quot;). 20 are returned from five additional member regions. Each region elects four MSs.

==Related legal systems==

After centuries of settlement and conquest, the United Kingdom has legal relationships to many territories outside its borders. These include sovereign states that do and do not share a monarch and judicial institutions with the UK, and dependencies where the UK government, parliament, and crown do retain some power.

===Independent sovereign states with British legal history===

Most countries that have gained independence from the UK are no longer subject to the British parliament, monarchy, or courts. They consist of a mix of republics (for example Ireland and India) and local monarchies (for example Kuwait and Brunei) with no relationship to the royal House of Windsor. The colonies and possessions were created and separated from the UK under a wide variety of circumstances, resulting in a spectrum of influence of British law in domestic law.

At the strongly influenced end of the spectrum, for example, is the United States. The Royal Proclamation of 1763 explicitly applied English Common Law to all British overseas colonies, and affirmed some degree of local law-making. The American Revolutionary War resulted in a unilateral separation recognized by the Peace of Paris (1783), but the English system continued to be used as the basis for court decisions.

Over time, it was modified by the United States Constitution, state constitutions, and federal and state court decisions particular to their own jurisdictions. Colonial land grants of the British kings still remained relevant in some later boundary disputes of the former Thirteen Colonies, though adjudicated by the Supreme Court of the United States. Some parts of the United States not subject to British rule have laws based on other traditions, such as French civil law in Louisiana, and Native American law in areas of tribal sovereignty.

Some countries were granted independence by an act of the UK parliament (for example, the Statute of Westminster 1931) and have likewise diverged from UK law either under or after British rule. An example at the other end of the spectrum, despite occasional control for geopolitical reasons, British law had little impact on the law of Afghanistan.

===Independent sovereign states with shared institutions===

By special agreement, the UK-based Judicial Committee of the Privy Council acts as the court of highest appeal for three former colonies which are now republics (Mauritius, Trinidad and Tobago, and for constitutional rights, Kiribati) and has a special consultation agreement with the Sultan of Brunei.

===Commonwealth realms===

Commonwealth realms, for example Australia, are former colonies that are now sovereign states fully independent of the UK parliament. However, they share other legal institutions with the UK, to varying degrees.

King Charles III remains the constitutional monarch of each realm in its own right, and retains a limited set of powers (royal prerogative) to be exercised either personally or through a local viceroy. Most powers are irrevocably delegated to a parliament more or less modelled on the Westminster system.

Crimes in Commonwealth realms are prosecuted in the name of the crown, and the crown remains the notional arbiter of disputes. In some realms appeals may be directed to the monarch as a last resort. Adjudication of these appeals is delegated to Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, which draws judges from the UK and across the Commonwealth. In other realms, a domestic court has been made the highest court of appeal. See for full list.

The &quot;Imperial&quot; Privy Council based in England advises the shared monarch on the use of royal prerogatives and parliament-authorized powers in the form of Orders in Council, and can also issue its own delegated Orders of Council. In some countries, a domestic council performs this function, namely:
* Federal Executive Council (Australia)
* King&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada
* Executive Council of New Zealand

Similar to other former colonies, Commonwealth realms also share a common legal history with the UK. For example, Canada underwent a long period of patriation of its constitution, beginning with the Constitution Act, 1867 and ending with the Constitution Act, 1982. Like their southern neighbours, the Proclamation of 1763 extended English Common law to all the Canadian colonies, including Nova Scotia (which being Scottish might have operated under Scots law). French civil law was later re-applied to Quebec.

===Crown Dependencies===
The Channel Islands are held by the British Monarch by virtue of inheriting the feudal title of Duke of Normandy. These were never part of England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, or the United Kingdom. Most of the historical Duchy of Normandy is on the European continent and was conquered by France. The Isle of Man is held by the British Monarch by virtue of inheriting the feudal title of Lord of Mann. It was previously ruled by Norway, England, and Scotland, before the feudal rights were purchased from Scottish dukes, after English-Scottish unification, by the United Kingdom in 1765. Due to local opposition, it was never merged into England as previously planned, and remains a distinct possession of the monarchy.

Each jurisdiction has a locally elected parliament with broad but not unlimited autonomy, which like the UK parliament requires royal assent to pass laws. The British monarchy retains responsibility for defence, citizenship law, and foreign affairs of the dependencies, and has delegated these responsibilities to the UK government and Parliament. The UK parliament generally acts in consultation or gains the consent of the local government when passing laws that have effect in the dependencies. The islands of Alderney and Sark in the Bailiwick of Guernsey have their own parliaments, and the parliament of Guernsey generally only extends Bailiwick-wide laws to them with their consent.

Residents of the dependencies do not have representation in the UK Parliament. UK law does not apply to the dependencies unless explicitly stated or clearly intended, and such laws are almost always executed by the monarch in the form of an Order in Council. This constitutional arrangement was tested when the Isle of Man, supply base for Radio Caroline, rejected the Marine, &amp;c., Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967, but the legislation was extended to the island anyway by an Order in Council. This resulted in some protests and talk of independence in the Manx legislature, but no consequential action. For centuries, UK laws have been considered to override local legislation, but since the 1980s, the Manx Staff of Government Division have asserted the two are co-equal.

Legal cases may be appealed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Residents are treated the same as residents of the UK for the purposes of British nationality law, though local governments control local immigration and employment. Prior to Brexit this made citizens of the British dependencies EU citizens, but the exchange of people and goods with the EU and UK was subject to special arrangements.

===British Overseas Territories===
Though not considered internal to the boundaries of United Kingdom, the UK maintains control over British Overseas Territories. Unlike Commonwealth realms, BOTs fall within the Monarchy of the United Kingdom. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is the court of final appeal. Three of the BOT are uninhabited, and Akrotiri and Dhekelia is military property; in these places, the UK government rules directly and on all matters.

The inhabited British Overseas Territories do not have representation in the UK parliament, and are thus on the United Nations list of non-self-governing territories. Gibraltar, prior to Brexit, was the only BOT which was a part of the European Union, and residents voted for a representative in the European Parliament in the South West England district. Prior to Brexit all citizens of British Overseas Territories were EU citizens, even though European Union law only applied in Gibraltar and the United Kingdom proper.

The inhabited territories each have their own legal system, based largely on English common law, with autonomy varying considerably with the size of the population. For example, Bermuda, Gibraltar, and the Falkland Islands are autonomously governed by their locally elected parliaments, with the UK responsible only for defence and foreign affairs and granting limited autonomy to local governments to have relations with other countries and international organizations. On the sparsely populated Pitcairn Islands, the representative of the UK government has nearly unlimited power.

Citizenship and nationality law is governed by the UK parliament. Immigration is controlled by local governments. The UK parliament retains the ultimate legislative power, and ensures good governance.

<doc id="77751" wikidata="Q146141" url="?curid=77751" title="Hans Christian Andersen (film)">
<text>Hans Christian Andersen is a 1952 Hollywood musical film directed by Charles Vidor and produced by Samuel Goldwyn. The screenplay by Moss Hart and an uncredited Ben Hecht is based on a story by Myles Connolly.

Although it is nominally about Hans Christian Andersen, the 19th-century Danish author of many world-famous fairy tales, the film is romantic fiction, and does not relate to Andersen&#x27;s biography: the introduction describes it as &quot;not the story of his life, but a fairy tale about this great spinner of fairy tales.&quot; Andersen, as played by Danny Kaye, is portrayed as a small-town cobbler with a childlike heart and a vivid imagination.

A large part of the narrative is told through song (music and lyrics by Frank Loesser) and ballet and includes many of the real Andersen&#x27;s most famous stories, such as &quot;The Ugly Duckling&quot;, &quot;Thumbelina&quot;, &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot; and &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;. The film was internationally successful at the time of release.

==Plot==
In the 1830s, in the small Danish town of Odense, cobbler Hans Christian Andersen spends his day spinning fairy tales for the village children. One day, the stern schoolmaster implores the Burgomaster and councilmen to curtail the cobbler&#x27;s habit of distracting the students with his storytelling. Hans finally returns to his shop, where his teenage assistant, the orphan Peter, begs him to stop causing trouble.

When the children do not arrive at school the next day, the schoolmaster deduces that Hans is again distracting his pupils. When the schoolmaster then demands that the Burgomaster and the councilmen choose between him and the cobbler, they decide that Hans must leave Odense. Peter tries to save his friend by suggesting they travel to Copenhagen.

After a sea voyage, Hans and Peter arrive at the city&#x27;s harbor and find their way to the Great Square of Copenhagen. When Hans introduces himself to the crowd while standing on a statue of the king, police arrest him for defaming the image of their leader. Peter, who has sought refuge from the police by hiding by the back entrance of the Royal Theatre, overhears choreographer Niels demand that a company producer send for a cobbler and asks them to free his friend from jail.

Hans sees a lonely young girl outside his jail cell window and offers to introduce her to his companion. By drawing on his thumb, Hans creates a puppet he calls Thumbelina and brings a smile to the girl&#x27;s face. Soon Hans is bailed out of jail by the theater company and taken to the theater, where he becomes entranced by the beauty and talent of a Royal Danish Ballet dress rehearsal. When Niels ridicules lead ballerina Doro&#x27;s performance, she in turn complains that her shoes need adjusting.

Doro gives the slippers to Hans, who is immediately smitten with the ballerina. Peter learns that Niels and Doro are a happily married couple, despite their theatrical quarrels. Hans resists the idea and writes a love letter to Doro in the form of a fable called &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, in which he tells her that she has chosen the wrong man. That night while Peter surreptitiously reads the letter, a gust of wind whisks it from his hands and carries it into the theater, where a stage doorman delivers it to Doro.

The next day, the entire ballet company sets off on their annual tour, leaving Hans bereft, but he soon finds comfort entertaining a new group of children with his stories. One day, Lars, a sad boy with a shaved head, remains behind after the other children tease him. Hans tells him the story of an ugly duckling who is ostracized by his peers until he becomes a handsome swan. When not with the children, Hans counts the days by making pair after pair of brightly colored satin slippers for his absent ballerina.

One day, Hans receives an invitation from the Gazette newspaper office, where Lars&#x27;s father, the publisher, thanks Hans for helping his son overcome his difficulties and offers to publish &quot;The Ugly Duckling&quot; in the newspaper. Overjoyed by the news, Hans asks that his credit be changed from &quot;Hans, the cobbler&quot; to &quot;Hans Christian Andersen&quot; and runs down the street singing his full name with pride.

That evening, when the ballet company returns, Doro tells Hans that they have created a ballet based on his story &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, which Hans believes is a sign of her love for him. The next evening, Peter warns Hans that Doro will humiliate him. Disappointed by his friend&#x27;s attitude, Hans suggests that they part ways and leaves for the opening of the new ballet. When Hans tries to deliver Doro&#x27;s slippers backstage, Niels locks the insistent writer in a closet to prevent him from disrupting the performers. While Hans listens to the music and dreams of his story, the performance opens on stage.

The morning after the ballet, Doro sends for Hans and discovers that he is in love with her and has misunderstood her relationship with Niels. Niels interrupts their conversation and insults Hans by offering to pay him for &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;. Hans refuses Niels&#x27;s offer and claims that his writing was a fluke. Doro accepts the slippers Hans made for her and allows him to leave. On the road to Odense, Hans meets Peter and renews their friendship. Upon reaching town, Hans is greeted as a celebrity and regales the citizens, including the schoolmaster, with his now famous moral tales.

==Production==
Producer Samuel Goldwyn conceived the idea for the film in 1936 and employed numerous writers to work on early drafts of the screenplay over the years. In 1941 he was reportedly in discussions with Walt Disney Studios to produce the film, but the deal fell through.

The film was eventually produced in the spring of 1952. As Danish authorities were not consulted on the film, there were complaints from Denmark that the film was a fairy tale rather than the true story of Andersen&#x27;s life and the Danish Foreign Office considered making a formal protest against the film.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack features eight songs, all with words and music by Frank Loesser.
#&quot;The King&#x27;s New Clothes&quot;
#&quot;The Inch Worm&quot;
#&quot;I&#x27;m Hans Christian Andersen&quot;
#&quot;Wonderful Copenhagen&quot;
#&quot;Thumbelina&quot;
#&quot;The Ugly Duckling&quot;
#&quot;Anywhere I Wander&quot;
#&quot;No Two People&quot;
A studio cast recording of the film&#x27;s songs was released by Decca, with Danny Kaye and Jane Wyman, as well as a backup chorus singing the songs. The album also included two Sylvia Fine originals made specifically for the album, &quot;Uncle Pockets&quot; and &quot;There&#x27;s a Hole at the Bottom of the Sea&quot;, and Danny Kaye&#x27;s narration of two Tubby the Tuba stories by Paul Tripp. The songs were originally released as a series of four 78 rpm singles, with two songs per disk, a 45 rpm album, and a 10&quot; LP.

The music for the Little Mermaid ballet incorporates passages from various pieces by Franz Liszt including Gnomenreigen and the Mephisto Waltzes.

==Release==
The film premiered in New York City on November 25, 1952, opening at the Paris Theatre and at the Criterion Theatre, and received a general release in both the United States and United Kingdom on December 19, 1952.

== Reception ==
The film opened in Copenhagen on September 6, 1953. In its first 6 days of release at two theaters, it grossed $80,000; it ultimately grossed $6 million in North America, making it one of the top ten grossing films of 1952.

=== Early reviews ===
The film received mixed critical response, though in its first week of release at the Palads Teatret it played to full capacity earning 74,000 Danish krone; however, in Andersen&#x27;s home town of Odense, this film was poorly received.

=== Critical reception ===
The film holds an 83% &quot;Fresh&quot; rating at Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 6/10, based on 6 reviews.

===Accolades===
The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2004: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs:
** &quot;Thumbelina&quot; – Nominated
* 2006: AFI&#x27;s Greatest Movie Musicals – Nominated

==First telecast==
The film was first telecast by ABC-TV in 1966. In an odd reversal of the situation for the early CBS telecasts of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, this time a host was needed because the film was too long for a two-hour time slot, rather than too short. It runs exactly two hours without commercials, and ABC did not wish to cut it, so they presented it as a family special with Victor Borge as host, and padded the telecast out to two-and-a-half hours. Borge was selected because, like the real Hans Christian Andersen, he was Danish.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Inchworm&quot; was featured in season 3, episode 16 of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, wherein Kaye guest starred.

<doc id="77752" wikidata="Q809024" url="?curid=77752" title="Barry Cryer">
<text>Barry Charles Cryer (23 March 1935 – 25 January 2022) was an English writer, comedian, and actor. As well as performing on stage, radio and television, Cryer wrote for many performers including Dave Allen, Stanley Baxter, Jack Benny, Rory Bremner, George Burns, Jasper Carrott, Tommy Cooper, Ronnie Corbett, Les Dawson, Dick Emery, Kenny Everett, Bruce Forsyth, David Frost, Bob Hope, Frankie Howerd, Richard Pryor, Spike Milligan, Mike Yarwood, &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; and Morecambe and Wise.

==Early life==
Barry Charles Cryer was born on 23 March 1935 in Leeds, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, to John Cryer, an accountant, who died when Barry was five, and his wife, Jean. After an education at Leeds Grammar School, he began studying English literature at the University of Leeds. He later described himself as a university dropout: &quot;I was supposed to be studying English Literature at Leeds, but I was in the bar and chasing girls and my first-year results showed it. So I&#x27;m &#x27;BA Eng. Lit. failed&#x27; of Leeds.&quot;

==Career==
Cryer was a writer for Leeds-based Proscenium Players, the first Jewish amateur stage group, which was founded in 1948. After appearing in the university revue, Cryer was offered a week&#x27;s work at the Leeds City Varieties theatre, home of &quot;The Good Old Days&quot;, which became the longest-running television entertainment show in the world. Cryer left university after learning his first-year results and travelled to London. After impressing impresario Vivian Van Damm, Cryer began as the bottom billing act at the Windmill Theatre in London, a theatre which showed comedy acts in between nude tableau shows. Cryer suffered severely from eczema and was hospitalised 12 times in eight years. He was released from his contract by Van Damm and concluded that a performing career was not a wholly sustainable income choice because of his skin condition, so he chose to focus on writing. 

Cryer joined the cast of &quot;Expresso Bongo&quot; (1957) with Susan Hampshire, Millicent Martin and Paul Scofield, during which he recorded the song &quot;The Purple People Eater&quot;, best known in the version by Sheb Wooley. For contractual reasons, Wooley&#x27;s version was never released in Scandinavia, Cryer&#x27;s was, and reached number one in Finland. Cryer&#x27;s first writing credits were four sketches for &quot;The Jimmy Logan Show&quot;, co-written with Douglas Camfield. Cryer became head writer with an occasional stage role for Danny La Rue&#x27;s London nightclub, where he was spotted by David Frost. This led to a writing role on the variety special &quot;A Degree of Frost&quot;, which led to Cryer joining the writing team, which also included John Cleese, Graham Chapman and Marty Feldman, on &quot;The Frost Report&quot; from 1966–67. Frost used Cryer on a number of subsequent shows, which established Cryer as a comedy writer in the 1970s. Cryer is seen serving the wine in the original performance of the Four Yorkshiremen sketch on &quot;At Last the 1948 Show&quot;, first broadcast in 1967. He enjoyed a prolific partnership with Chapman, in pre-Monty Python days. They wrote about 50 television shows together, including &quot;Doctor in the House&quot; (ITV, 1969–70), and several for Ronnie Corbett: &quot;No – That&#x27;s Me Over Here!&quot; (ITV, 1968–70), &quot;Now Look Here&quot; (BBC, 1971–73) and &quot;The Prince of Denmark&quot; (BBC, 1974). With other writers he contributed to &quot;The Ronnie Corbett Show&quot; (BBC, 1987) and &quot;Ronnie Corbett in Bed&quot; (BBC, 1971), and was also part of &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; (1971–87) team.

Cryer always preferred to write in partnership, so that should he dry up he was never left to deliver material. His regular partner during the 1970s was John Junkin, and with Junkin performing as Eric Morecambe and Cryer most often the role of Ernie Wise, the pair wrote some of &quot;The Morecambe and Wise Show&quot; in its BBC period (the 1972 and 1976 Christmas shows) when regular writer Eddie Braben was unavailable. Cryer still enjoyed performing, appearing with Tim Brooke-Taylor and Junkin in the BBC radio series &quot;Hello, Cheeky!&quot;, in which the three performers bounced jokes off each other. He also appeared in the comedy television series &quot;The Steam Video Company&quot; and provided the voice of the judge in the 1975 animated comedy musical &quot;Dick Deadeye, or Duty Done&quot;. He hosted the ITV comedy panel game &quot;Jokers Wild&quot; (1969–74) and had a role in &quot;All You Need Is Cash&quot;, a 1978 spoof documentary about the Beatles parody band the Rutles, as well as a cameo as a police inspector in Kenny Everett&#x27;s 1984 horror spoof &quot;Bloodbath at the House of Death&quot;.

With new comedians coming forward who wrote their own material, and age progressing and still wanting to perform, Cryer refocused his career to include more performance, touring with Willie Rushton in &quot;Two Old Farts in the Night&quot; and, after Rushton&#x27;s death, &quot;That Reminds Me&quot;. After a brief early stint as chairman, Cryer was one of the panellists on the BBC radio comedy programme &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;, which began in 1972. He also wrote and starred in &quot;You&#x27;ll Have Had Your Tea&quot; with Graeme Garden.

He wrote an autobiography, &quot;You Won&#x27;t Believe This But...&quot;, as well as a book of miscellaneous anecdotes, &quot;Pigs Can Fly&quot;. In 2005 he toured the UK with &quot;Barry Cryer: The First Farewell Tour&quot;, and in 2008 he toured with Colin Sell in &quot;Barry Cryer: Still Alive&quot;. He remained a popular after-dinner speaker.
He performed comic monologues and songs on &quot;The Green Tie on the Little Yellow Dog&quot;, which was recorded in 1982, and broadcast by Channel 4 in 1983.

In 1987 Cryer was the guest for Michael Parkinson on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; where his musical choices included &quot;Bad Penny Blues&quot; by Humphrey Lyttelton and His Band, &quot;The Girl Can&#x27;t Help It&quot; by Little Richard and &quot;I Get Along Without You Very Well&quot; by Carly Simon. He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in June 1995 when he was surprised by Michael Aspel at Thames Television&#x27;s Teddington Studios.

His clip show &quot;Comedy Legends with Barry Cryer&quot;, a programme paying tribute to a number of comedians such as Tommy Cooper, Frankie Howerd and Bob Hope with &quot;comedy experts&quot; Tony Hawks, Steve Punt and critic Stephen Armstrong giving their opinions on the stars, began airing on Sky Arts in 2018.

In 2021 Cryer was honoured with a Lifetime Achievement Award by the British Music Hall Society.

==Personal life and death==
Cryer married Theresa Donovan, a singer and dancer known as Terry, in 1962. Interviewed by &quot;Country Life&quot; in 2021 Cryer attributed his success to his wife. In his early days as a stand-up comedian, he had been badly afflicted by eczema. After encountering Theresa in a nightclub in Piccadilly, his health improved; &quot;I was only in hospital once more after meeting her.&quot; They had four children, seven grandchildren and, at the time of Cryer&#x27;s death, one great-grandchild.

Cryer was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 2001 Birthday Honours for services to comedy drama. In July 2013 Leeds Metropolitan University made him an honorary Doctor of Arts. In July 2017 he received an honorary Doctorate of Letters from the University of Leeds. He was a member of the entertainment charity the Grand Order of Water Rats. In the 1980s he was a supporter of the Social Democratic Party.

Cryer died at Northwick Park Hospital in Harrow on 25 January 2022, aged 86. A memorial event was held at the Moon and Sixpence pub in Hatch End, where Cryer was a regular customer, to raise funds for Macmillan Nurses and the Royal Variety Charity. At the event, a memorial mural of Cryer was unveiled by his widow, containing photos of Cryer and some of his famous jokes.

<text>FLAC (; Free Lossless Audio Codec) is an audio coding format for lossless compression of digital audio, developed by the Xiph.Org Foundation, and is also the name of the free software project producing the FLAC tools, the reference software package that includes a codec implementation. Digital audio compressed by FLAC&#x27;s algorithm can typically be reduced to between 50 and 70 percent of its original size and decompresses to an identical copy of the original audio data.

FLAC is an open format with royalty-free licensing and a reference implementation which is free software. FLAC supports metadata tagging, album cover art, and fast seeking.

== History ==
Development was started in 2000 by Josh Coalson. The bitstream format was frozen with the release of version 0.9 of the reference implementation on 31 March 2001. Version 1.0 was released on 20 July 2001.

On 29 January 2003, the Xiph.Org Foundation and the FLAC project announced the incorporation of FLAC under the Xiph.org banner. Xiph.org is home to other free compression formats such as Vorbis, Theora, Speex and Opus.

Version 1.3.0 was released on 26 May 2013, at which point development was moved to the Xiph.org git repository.

In 2019, FLAC was proposed as an IETF standard. 

In December 2024, FLAC was formally specified in and published as .

== Design ==
FLAC is a lossless encoding of linear pulse-code modulation data.

=== File structure ===
A FLAC file consists of the magic number codice_1, metadata, and encoded audio.

The encoded audio is divided into frames, each of which consists of a header, a data block, and a CRC16 checksum. Each frame is encoded independent of each other. A frame header begins with a sync word, used to identify the beginning of a valid frame. The rest of the header contains the number of samples, position of the frame, channel assignment, and optionally the sample rate and bit depth. The data block contains the audio information.

Metadata in FLAC precedes the audio. Properties like the sample rate and the number of channels are always contained in the metadata. It may also contain other information, the album cover for example. FLAC uses Vorbis comments for textual metadata like track title and artist name.

=== Encoding and decoding ===
The FLAC encoding algorithm consists of multiple stages. In the first stage, the input audio is split into blocks. If the audio contains multiple channels, each channel is encoded separately as a subblock. The encoder then tries to find a good mathematical approximation of the block, either by fitting a simple polynomial, or through general linear predictive coding. A description of the approximation, which is only a few bytes in length, is then written. Finally, the difference between the approximation and the input, called residual, is encoded using Rice coding. In many cases, a description of the approximation and the encoded residual takes up less space than using pulse-code modulation.

The decoding process is the reverse of encoding. The compressed residual is first decoded. The description of the mathematical approximation is then used to calculate a waveform. The result is formed by adding the residual and the calculated waveform. As FLAC compresses losslessly, the decoded waveform is identical to the waveform before encoding.

For two-channel stereo, the encoder may choose to joint-encode the audio. The channels are transformed into a side channel, which is the difference between the two input channels, and a mid channel, the sum of the two input channels. In place of a mid channel, the left channel or the right channel may be encoded instead, which is sometimes more space-efficient.

Even though the reference encoder uses a single block size for the whole stream, FLAC allows the block size in samples to vary per block.

=== Compression ===
The amount of compression is determined by various parameters, including the order of the linear prediction model and the block size. Regardless of the amount of compression, the original data can always be reconstructed perfectly.

For the user&#x27;s convenience, the reference implementation defines 9 compression levels, which are presets of the more technical parameters to the encoding algorithm. The levels are labeled from 0 to 8, with higher numbers resulting in a higher compression ratio, at the cost of compression speed. The meaning of each compression level varies by implementation.

FLAC is optimized for decoding speed at the expense of encoding speed. A benchmark has shown that, while there is little variation in decoding speed as compression level increases, beyond the default compression level 5, the encoding process takes up considerably more time with little space saved compared to level 5.

=== Implementation ===
Alongside the format, the FLAC project also contains a free and open-source reference implementation of FLAC called libFLAC. libFLAC contains facilities to encode and decode FLAC data and to manipulate the metadata of FLAC files. libFLAC++, an object-oriented wrapper around libFLAC for C++, and the command-line programs codice_2 and codice_3, are also part of the reference implementation.

The FLAC format, along with libFLAC, are not known to be covered by any patents, and anyone is free to write their own implementations of FLAC.

== Comparison to other formats ==
FLAC is specifically designed for efficient packing of audio data, unlike general-purpose lossless algorithms such as DEFLATE, which are used in ZIP and gzip. While ZIP may reduce the size of a CD-quality audio file by 10–20%, FLAC is able to reduce the size of audio data by 40–50% by taking advantage of the characteristics of audio.

The technical strengths of FLAC compared to other lossless formats lie in its ability to be streamed and decoded quickly, independent of compression level.

Since FLAC is a lossless scheme, it is suitable as an archive format for owners of CDs and other media who wish to preserve their audio collections. If the original media are lost, damaged, or worn out, a FLAC copy of the audio tracks ensures that an exact duplicate of the original data can be recovered at any time. An exact restoration from a lossy copy (e.g., MP3) of the same data is impossible. FLAC&#x27;s being lossless means it is highly suitable for transcoding e.g. to MP3, without the normally associated transcoding quality loss between one lossy format and another. A CUE file can optionally be created when ripping a CD. If a CD is read and ripped perfectly to FLAC files, the CUE file allows later burning of an audio CD that is identical in audio data to the original CD, including track order and pregap, but excluding additional data such as lyrics and CD+G graphics. But depending on the burning program used, CD-Text may be recovered from the metadata stored in the CUE sheet and burned back to a new copy on blank CD-R media.

== Adoption and implementations ==
=== Reference implementation ===
The reference implementation of FLAC is implemented as the &quot;libFLAC&quot; core encoder &amp; decoder library, with the main distributable program codice_2 being the reference implementation of the libFLAC API. This codec API is also available in C++ as libFLAC++. The reference implementation of FLAC compiles on many platforms, including most Unix (such as Solaris, BSD) and Unix-like (including Linux), Windows, BeOS, and OS/2 operating systems. There are build-systems for autoconf/automake, MSVC, Watcom C, and Xcode. There is currently no multicore support in libFLAC, but utilities such as GNU parallel and various graphical frontends can be used to spin up multiple instances of the encoder.

=== Hardware and software ===
FLAC playback support in portable audio devices and dedicated audio systems is limited compared to formats such as MP3 or uncompressed PCM. FLAC support is included by default in Windows 10, Android, macOS and iOS.
Various other containers are supported, independently from used operating system, depending on used playback software.

=== Use in archives ===
The standardization process of the FLAC format into was driven by the specific use case of archival and preservation in mind. The National Archives and Records Administration has FLAC listed as a preferred format for digital audio.

<text>Emil Christian Hansen (8 May 1842 – 27 August 1909) was a Danish mycologist and fermentation physiologist.

==Early life and education==
Hansen was born in Ribe to Joseph Christian Hansen, a house-painter, and his wife Ane Catherina Dyhre. 

Between 1874 and 1875 he edited and distributed an mycological exsiccata work, namely &quot;Fungorum fimicolorum exempl. exsiccati&quot;, with 350 numbered specimen units. He was awarded a gold medal in 1876 for an essay on fungi, titled &quot;De danske Gjødningssvampe&quot;. During his days as a university student in Copenhagen, he worked as an unpaid assistant to zoologist Japetus Steenstrup (1813–1897).

==Career==
In 1876, with Alfred Jørgensen (1848–1925), he published a Danish translation of Charles Darwin’s &quot;The Voyage of the Beagle&quot;; &quot;Rejse om Jorden&quot;. From 1879 to 1909, he was director of the physiological department at Carlsberg Laboratory.

Hired by the Carlsberg Laboratory in Copenhagen in 1879, he became the first to isolate a pure cell of yeast in 1883, and after combining it with a sugary solution, produced more yeast than was in a yeast bank. It was named as &quot;Saccharomyces carlsbergensis&quot; after the laboratory, and is the yeast from which are derived, all yeasts used in lager beers. See Fermentation, Yeast.

Hansen is the taxonomic authority of the fungal genus &quot;Anixiopsis&quot; (1897) from the family Onygenaceae.

He was honoured in 1911, when botanist H. Zikes published &quot;Hanseniaspora&quot;, which is a genus of yeasts.

<doc id="77765" wikidata="Q5528688" url="?curid=77765" title="Gay square dance">
<text>Gay square dance is square dance as it is generally danced in the gay and lesbian community. The first gay and lesbian square dance clubs formed in the mid-to-late 1970s in the USA. There are currently about eighty gay square dance clubs worldwide.

Gay square dance is typically open to all square dancers, regardless of sexual orientation. The dancing is generally modern Western square dancing, as it is practiced throughout the world, standardized by Callerlab, the International Association of Square Dance Callers, and as generally practiced by clubs belonging to the International Association of Gay Square Dance Clubs (IAGSDC), the umbrella organization for gay square dance clubs.

In addition to gay modern western square dance clubs, there are gay and lesbian clubs for other dance forms, both square dance and non-square dance forms, including &quot;traditional&quot; and exhibition-style square dancing.

==Differences from other clubs==
The primary differences between gay square dancing and that practiced in other clubs are:

* Costuming: Square dance clubs often have a dress code; gay square dance clubs usually are &quot;casual&quot;, that is, no costume or special clothing requirement. Shorts and T-shirts are perfectly acceptable. Clubs sponsoring dances advertise the level of costuming expected at their function.
* Singles more often accepted: Gay square dancing has no partner requirement. In some non-gay square dancing, one is generally expected to arrive at a dance with a partner. At a gay square dance, it is always permissible to get into a square without a partner and hold a hand up if you are looking for one. At non-gay clubs, more people dance with the same partner for the entire evening than at gay clubs where people often dance with a variety of partners throughout a dance.
* One&#x27;s dance role is less synonymous with one&#x27;s actual sex: People more often dance the opposite gender&#x27;s role than in the general western square dance community. This is known in square dance jargon as &quot;all position dancing&quot; (APD) and is common in upper-level challenge square dancing as well; the use in early all-male square dances of handkerchiefs to indicate one&#x27;s preferred position(s) is the source of the handkerchief code of later LGBT culture.
* Styling: Special styling variations (known as &quot;flourishes&quot;) are particular to gay square dancing (although they may diffuse into the community at large), and there are additional &quot;sound effects&quot; (dancers&#x27; vocal responses to the caller) connected with gay square dancing as well.
* Energy level: The energy level tends to be higher in gay square dancing – tempos may be higher, more flourishes added, longer dances with shorter breaks.
* Dancing with other clubs: Non-gay square dance groups often attend special dances (sometimes known as &quot;hoedowns&quot;) hosted by other clubs in the area, or visit other clubs at their regular dances (so-called &quot;banner raids&quot;). Since it is rare to have more than one gay club in an area, clubs will instead host &quot;fly-ins&quot;, which will attract attendees from outside the region, and last an entire weekend instead of just one night. Both practices serve the same purpose of allowing clubs to have larger dances, but the greater distances traveled and greater length for fly-ins requires more planning and promotion, will usually have more than one caller, and entail greater costs.
* Alcohol: Non-gay square dance groups generally have an absolute ban on alcohol at or near dances. Gay square dance groups do not treat this prohibition as an absolute, and some dance in gay bars. Most will prohibit alcohol at their regular classes and dances, both for liability reasons and to provide an atmosphere distinct from gay bars.
* Age level: Non-gay square dancing tends to attract large numbers of older couples; the average in some clubs will be above 50. Gay square dancing involves many younger people.

It is worth noting that this style of dancing—casual dress, no couple requirement, all-position dancing, high energy level—has been adopted by some newer non-gay square dance clubs (and youth square dance clubs in particular). The continued flourishing of gay square dancing continues to influence the rest of the square dance community.

<text>Special forces units in the Israel Defense Forces encompass a broad definition of specialist units. Such units are usually a regiment or a battalion in strength.

Sayeret (, pl.: &quot;sayarot&quot;), or &quot;reconnaissance&quot; units in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) nomenclature, specialize in intelligence gathering and surveillance. In practice, these units specialize in commando and other special forces roles, in addition to reconnaissance (the degree of specialization varies by units and current needs).

[[Mista&#x27;arvim]] (, &quot;lit.&quot; Arabized; , &quot;Musta&#x27;arabin&quot;), also spelled as mistaravim, are counter-terrorism units whose members are specifically trained to operate undercover, in enemy territory, in order to assassinate or capture wanted targets.

== Special forces units in the IDF ==
=== Unit 101 ===

Commando Unit 101, the founding Israeli special forces unit, was established and commanded by Ariel Sharon on orders from Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion in August 1953. They were armed with non-standard weapons and tasked with carrying out retribution operations across the state&#x27;s borders – in particular, establishing small unit maneuvers, activation and tactical insertion and exit tactics.

Members of the unit were recruited only from agricultural Kibbutzim and Moshavim. Membership in the unit was by invitation only, and any new member had to be voted on by all existing members before they were accepted.

The unit was merged into the 890th Paratroop Battalion during January 1954, on orders of General Dayan, Chief of Staff, because he wanted their experience and spirit to be spread among all infantry units of IDF starting with the paratroopers. They are considered to have had a significant influence on the development of subsequent Israeli special forces units.

=== Sayeret units today ===

All combat brigades in the IDF include a unit with improved weaponry and training used for reconnaissance and special forces missions, trained to use advanced weapons and reconnaissance technology, as well as hand-to-hand combat. Historically the brigades used to only have one company-sized unit outfitted to do this job, known as Palsar (Hebrew contraction of: פלוגת-סיור, &quot;Plugat Siyur&quot; (singular) / &quot;Plugot Siyur&quot; (plural), &quot;Reconnaissance Company&quot;). Although the &quot;Palsar&quot; are mostly oriented at battlefield support (which is their &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot;), many have participated in special operations over the years.

While in the past there were differences between the &quot;Siyur&quot; units, learning from past events and in order to improve and develop their forces, the IDF has consolidating them into larger units with many different capabilities: battalion-sized units called Gadsar (contraction of &quot;Gdud Siyur&quot;, &quot;Reconnaissance battalion&quot;). Each &quot;Gadsar&quot; is made up of three specialized &quot;Plugot&quot; (companies): demolitions and combat engineering (&quot;Plugat Habalah Handasit&quot;, or Palhan), reconnaissance (&quot;Plugat Siyur&quot;, Palsar) and anti-tank (&quot;Pluga Neged Tankim&quot;, or Palnat).

In late December 2015, several IDF special forces units were transferred to the Oz Brigade.

Other SF units or &quot;Sayaret&quot; are larger units, operating directly under the General Staff. They are tasked with the most sensitive missions but they also support other conventional and SF units, if needed. Those units are Sayeret Matkal, Shayetet 13 and Shaldag.

<doc id="77767" wikidata="Q682846" url="?curid=77767" title="The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars">
<text>The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (often shortened to Ziggy Stardust) is the fifth studio album by the English musician David Bowie, released on 16June 1972 in the United Kingdom through RCA Records. It was co-produced by Bowie and Ken Scott and features Bowie&#x27;s backing band the Spiders from Mars — Mick Ronson (guitar), Trevor Bolder (bass) and Mick Woodmansey (drums). It was recorded from November 1971 to February 1972 at Trident Studios in London.

Described as a loose concept album and rock opera, &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; focuses on Bowie&#x27;s titular alter ego Ziggy Stardust, a fictional androgynous and bisexual rock star who is sent to Earth as a saviour before an impending apocalyptic disaster. In the story, Ziggy wins the hearts of fans but suffers a fall from grace after succumbing to his own ego. The character was inspired by numerous musicians, including Vince Taylor. Most of the album&#x27;s concept was developed after the songs were recorded. The glam rock and proto-punk musical styles were influenced by Iggy Pop, The Velvet Underground and Marc Bolan. The lyrics discuss the artificiality of rock music, political issues, drug use, sexuality and stardom. The album cover, photographed in monochrome and recoloured, was taken in London outside the home of furriers &quot;K. West&quot;.

Preceded by the single &quot;Starman&quot;, &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; reached top five of the UK Albums Chart. Critics responded favourably; some praised the musicality and concept while others struggled to comprehend it. Shortly after its release, Bowie performed &quot;Starman&quot; on Britain&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in early July 1972, which propelled him to stardom. The Ziggy character was retained for the subsequent Ziggy Stardust Tour, performances from which have appeared on live albums and a concert film. Bowie described the follow-up album, &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot;, as &quot;Ziggy goes to America&quot;.

In later decades, &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; has been considered Bowie&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot;, appearing on numerous professional lists of the greatest albums of all time. Bowie had ideas for a musical based on the album, although this project never came to fruition; ideas were later used for &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; (1974). &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; has been reissued several times and was remastered in 2012 for its 40th anniversary. In 2017, it was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress, being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Background==
After his promotional tour of America in February 1971, David Bowie returned to Haddon Hall in England and began writing songs, many of which were inspired by the diverse musical genres that were present in America. He wrote over three dozen songs, many of which would appear on his fourth studio album &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; and &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;; among these were &quot;Moonage Daydream&quot; and &quot;Hang On to Yourself&quot;, which he recorded with his short-lived band Arnold Corns in February 1971, and subsequently reworked for &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;.

&quot;Hunky Dory&quot; was recorded in the middle of 1971 at Trident Studios in London, with Ken Scott producing. The sessions featured the musicians who would later become known as the Spiders from Mars – the guitarist Mick Ronson, the bassist Trevor Bolder, and the drummer Mick Woodmansey. According to Woodmansey, &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; and &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; were almost recorded back-to-back, but the Spiders realised that most of the songs on &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; were not suitable live material, so they needed a follow-up album with material they could use on tour.

After Bowie&#x27;s manager Tony Defries ended his contract with Mercury Records, Defries presented the album to multiple labels in the US, including New York City&#x27;s RCA Records. The head of the label, Dennis Katz, heard the tapes and saw the potential of the piano-based songs, signing Bowie to a three-album deal in September 1971; RCA became Bowie&#x27;s label for the rest of the decade. &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; was released in December to very positive reviews from critics but sold poorly.

==Recording and production==

The first song to be properly recorded for &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; was the Ron Davies cover &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Easy&quot;, on 9 July 1971. Originally slated for release on &quot;Hunky Dory&quot;, the song was passed for inclusion on that album and subsequently placed on &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;. With &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; being readied for release, the sessions for &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; officially began at Trident on 8November 1971, using the same personnel as &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; minus Wakeman. In 2012, Scott said that &quot;95 percent of the vocals on the four albums I did with him as producer, they were first takes.&quot; According to the biographer Nicholas Pegg, Bowie&#x27;s &quot;sense of purpose&quot; during the sessions was &quot;decisive and absolute&quot;; he knew exactly what he wanted for each individual track. Since most of the tracks were recorded almost entirely live, Bowie recalled that at some points, he had to hum Ronson&#x27;s solos to him. Due to Bowie&#x27;s generally dismissive attitude during the sessions for &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; (1970), Ronson had to craft his solos individually and had very little guidance. Bowie had a much better attitude when recording &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; and &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;, and gave Ronson guidance on what he was looking for. For the album, Ronson used an electric guitar plugged to a 100-watt Marshall amplifier and a wah-wah pedal; Bowie played acoustic rhythm guitar.

On 8November 1971, the band recorded initial versions of &quot;Star&quot; (then titled &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Star&quot;) and &quot;Hang On to Yourself&quot;, both of which were deemed unsuccessful. Both songs were rerecorded three days later on 11November, along with &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;, &quot;Looking For a Friend&quot;, &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot;, and &quot;Sweet Head&quot;. The next day the band recorded two takes of &quot;Moonage Daydream&quot;, one of &quot;Soul Love&quot;, two of &quot;Lady Stardust&quot;, and two of a new version of &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; track &quot;The Supermen&quot;. Three days later on 15November, the band recorded &quot;Five Years&quot; as well as unfinished versions of &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Rain Again&quot; and &quot;Shadow Man&quot;. Woodmansey described the recording process as very fast-paced. He said they would record the songs, listen to them, and if they did not capture the sound they were looking for, record them again. On that day a running order was created, which included the Chuck Berry cover &quot;Around and Around&quot; (titled &quot;Round and Round&quot;), the Jacques Brel cover &quot;Amsterdam&quot;, a new recording of &quot;Holy Holy&quot;, and &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot;. &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Easy&quot; was absent from the list. According to Pegg, the album was to be titled &quot;Round and Round&quot; as late as 15December.

After the 15November session the group took a break for the holiday season. Reconvening on 4January 1972, the band held rehearsals for three days at Will Palin&#x27;s Underhill Studios in Blackheath, London, in preparation for the final recording sessions. After recording some of the new songs for radio presenter Bob Harris&#x27;s &quot;Sounds of the 70s&quot; as the newly dubbed Spiders from Mars in January 1972, the band returned to Trident that month to begin work on &quot;Suffragette City&quot; and &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Suicide&quot;. After receiving a complaint from the RCA executive Dennis Katz that the album did not contain a single, Bowie wrote &quot;Starman&quot;, which replaced &quot;Round and Round&quot; on the track listing at the last minute. According to biographer Kevin Cann, the replacement occurred on 2February. Two days later, the band recorded &quot;Starman&quot;, &quot;Suffragette City&quot;, and &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Suicide&quot; bringing the sessions to a close.

==Concept and themes==
===Overview===

&quot;The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and The Spiders from Mars&quot; is about a bisexual alien rock superstar named Ziggy Stardust. It was not initially conceived as a concept album; much of the story was written after the album was recorded. Tracks rewritten for the narrative included &quot;Star&quot; (originally titled &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Star&quot;), &quot;Moonage Daydream&quot;, and &quot;Hang On to Yourself&quot;. Some reviewers have categorised the record as being a rock opera, although Paul Trynka argues that it is less an opera and more a &quot;collection of snapshots thrown together and later edited into a sequence that makes sense.&quot; The characters were androgynous. Mick Woodmansey said the clothes they had worn had &quot;femininity and sheer outrageousness&quot;. He also said that the characters&#x27; looks &quot;definitely appealed to our rebellious artistic instincts&quot;. Nenad Georgievski of &quot;All About Jazz&quot; said the record was presented with &quot;high-heeled boots, multicolored dresses, extravagant makeup and outrageous sexuality&quot;. Bowie had already developed an androgynous appearance, which was approved by critics, but received mixed reactions from audiences.

The album&#x27;s lyrics discuss the artificiality of rock music in general, political issues, drug use, sexual orientation, and stardom. Stephen Thomas Erlewine described the lyrics as &quot;fractured, paranoid&quot; and &quot;evocative of a decadent, decaying future&quot;. Apart from the narrative, &quot;Star&quot; reflects Bowie&#x27;s idealisations of becoming a star himself and shows his frustrations at not having fulfilled his potential. On the other hand, &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Easy&quot; has nothing to do with the overarching narrative. The outtakes &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot; and &quot;Sweet Head&quot; did fit the narrative, but both contained provocative lyrics, which likely contributed to their exclusions. Meanwhile &quot;Suffragette City&quot; contains a false ending, followed by the phrase &quot;wham bam, thank you, ma&#x27;am!&quot; Bowie uses American slang and pronunciations throughout, such as &quot;news guy&quot;, &quot;cop&quot; and &quot;TV&quot; (instead of &quot;newsreader&quot;, &quot;policeman&quot;, and &quot;telly&quot; respectively). Richard Cromelin of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called Bowie&#x27;s imagery and storytelling in the track some of his most &quot;adventuresome&quot; up to that point, while James Parker of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; wrote that Bowie is &quot;one of the most potent lyricists in rock history&quot;.

===Inspirations===

One of the main inspirations for Ziggy Stardust was the English singer Vince Taylor, whom Bowie met after Taylor had a mental breakdown and believed himself to be a cross between a god and an alien. Iggy Pop, the singer of the proto-punk band the Stooges, provided another main inspiration. Bowie had recently become infatuated with the singer and took influence from him for his next record, both musically and lyrically. Other influences for the character included Bowie&#x27;s earlier album &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;, Lou Reed, the singer and guitarist of the Velvet Underground; Marc Bolan, the singer and guitarist of the glam rock band T. Rex; and the cult musician Legendary Stardust Cowboy. An alternative theory is that during a tour, Bowie developed the concept of Ziggy as a melding of the persona of Iggy Pop with the music of Reed, producing &quot;the ultimate pop idol&quot;. Woodmansey also cited the guitarist and singer Jimi Hendrix and the progressive rock band King Crimson as being influences.

Sources for the Ziggy Stardust name included the Legendary Stardust Cowboy, the song &quot;Stardust&quot; by Hoagy Carmichael, and Bowie&#x27;s fascination with glitter. A girlfriend recalled Bowie &quot;scrawling notes on a cocktail napkin about a crazy rock star named Iggy or Ziggy&quot;, and on his return to England he declared his intention to create a character &quot;who looks like he&#x27;s landed from Mars&quot;. In 1990, Bowie explained that the &quot;Ziggy&quot; part came from a tailor&#x27;s shop called Ziggy&#x27;s that he passed on a train. He liked it because it had &quot;that Iggy [Pop] connotation but it was a tailor&#x27;s shop, and I thought, Well, this whole thing is gonna be about clothes, so it was my own little joke calling him Ziggy. So Ziggy Stardust was a real compilation of things.&quot; He later asserted that Ziggy Stardust was born out of a desire to move away from the denim and hippies of the 1960s.

In 2015, Tanja Stark proposed that due to Bowie&#x27;s well-known fascination with esoterica and his self-identification as &#x27;Jungian&#x27;, the Ziggy character may be a neologism influenced by Carl Jung, Greek and Gnostic concepts of Syzygy with their connotations of androgyny, the conjunction of male and female, and union of celestial bodies &quot;hinting perhaps, at &#x27;Syzygy&#x27; Stardust as futuristic alchemical theatre... foreshadow[ing] the double-headed mannequin of &#x27;Where Are We Now?&#x27; (2013)&quot;.

===Story===
The album begins with &quot;Five Years&quot;; a news broadcast reveals that the Earth only has five years left before it gets destroyed by an impending apocalyptic disaster. The first two verses are from the point of view of a child hearing this news for the first time and going numb as it sinks in. The listener is addressed directly by the third verse, while the character of Ziggy Stardust is introduced indirectly. Afterwards the listener hears the point of view of numerous characters dealing with love before the impending disaster (&quot;Soul Love&quot;). Biographer Marc Spitz called attention to the sense of &quot;pre-apocalypse frustration&quot; in the track. Doggett said that following the &quot;panoramic vision&quot; of &quot;Five Years&quot;, &quot;Soul Love&quot; offers a more &quot;optimistic&quot; landscape, with bongos and acoustic guitar indicating &quot;mellow fruitfulness.&quot; Ziggy directly introduces himself in &quot;Moonage Daydream&quot;, where he proclaims himself &quot;an alligator&quot; (strong and remorseless), &quot;a mama-papa&quot; (non-gender specific), &quot;the space invader&quot; (alien and phallic), &quot;a rock &#x27;n&#x27; rollin&#x27; bitch&quot;, and a &quot;pink-monkey-bird&quot; (gay slang for a recipient of anal sex).

&quot;Starman&quot; sees Ziggy bringing a message of hope to Earth&#x27;s youth through the radio, salvation by an alien &#x27;Starman&#x27;, told from the point of view of one of the youths who hears Ziggy. &quot;Lady Stardust&quot; presents an unfinished tale with what Doggett states as &quot;no hint at a denouement beyond a vague air of melancholy&quot;. Ziggy is recalled by the audience using both &#x27;he&#x27; and &#x27;she&#x27; pronouns, showing a lack of gender distinction. Ziggy then looks at himself through a mirror, pondering what it would be like to make it &quot;as a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll star&quot; and if it would all be &quot;worthwhile&quot; (&quot;Star&quot;). In &quot;Hang On to Yourself&quot;, Ziggy is put in front of the crowd. The track emphasises the metaphor that rock music goes from sex to fulfilment and back to sex again; Ziggy plans to abandon the sexual climax for a chance at stardom, which ultimately leads to his downfall.

&quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; is the central piece of the narrative, presenting a complete &quot;birth-to-death chronology&quot; of Ziggy. He is described as a &quot;well-hung, snow white-tanned, left-hand guitar-playing man&quot; who rises to fame with his backing band the Spiders from Mars, but he lets his ego take control of him, effectively alienating his fans and losing his bandmates. Unlike &quot;Lady Stardust&quot;, &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; shows the character&#x27;s rise and fall in a very human manner. O&#x27;Leary notes that the song&#x27;s narrator is not definitive: it could be an audience member retrospectively discussing Ziggy, it could be one of the Spiders or even the &quot;dissociated memories&quot; of Ziggy himself. After his fall from grace, Ziggy is described by Pegg as &quot;a hollow figure caught in the headlights of braking cars as he stumbles across the road.&quot; Rather than dying in blood, Ziggy cries to the audience (&quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Suicide&quot;), requesting they &quot;give him their hands&quot; because they are &quot;wonderful&quot; before perishing on stage.

==Musical styles==

The music on &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; has been retrospectively described as glam rock. It was additionally described by journalist Jordan Blum of &quot;PopMatters&quot; as a &quot;definitive slice of proto-punk&quot;, albeit with sophisticated production and scope. Georgievski felt the record represents Bowie&#x27;s interests in &quot;theater, dance, pantomime, &quot;kabuki&quot;, cabaret, and science fiction&quot;. The Library of Congress also notes the presence of blues, garage rock, soul, and stadium rock. Some of the tracks also feature elements of 1950s rock and pop (&quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Suicide&quot; and &quot;Sweet Head&quot;), pop and jazz (&quot;Soul Love&quot;), heavy metal (&quot;Moonage Daydream&quot;) and late-1970s punk rock (&quot;Hang On to Yourself&quot;). Bowie himself compared the record&#x27;s sound to the music of Iggy Pop. Author James Perone opined that the music is &quot;more focused&quot; than Bowie&#x27;s previous works, being full of melodic and harmonic hooks.

After the departure of Rick Wakeman on keyboards, the songs on &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; are considerably less piano-led than the songs on &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; and are more guitar-led, primarily due to the influence of Ronson&#x27;s guitar and string arrangements. Nevertheless, biographers have noted stylistic similarities to &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; in &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot; and the string arrangement for &quot;Starman&quot;. Ronson played piano on the album as well as guitar and strings; according to Pegg, his playing on tracks like &quot;Five Years&quot; and &quot;Lady Stardust&quot; foreshadows the skills he showcases on Lou Reed&#x27;s &quot;Transformer&quot; (1972). Meanwhile, his electric guitar playing dominates tracks including &quot;Moonage Daydream&quot;, &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Easy&quot;, &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;, and &quot;Suffragette City&quot;. Additionally Bowie&#x27;s acoustic guitar playing is prominent on some tracks, notably &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Suicide&quot;. Perone argues that although listeners tend to pay closer attention to Ronson&#x27;s electric, &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; is &quot;one of the better albums&quot; in Bowie&#x27;s catalogue to highlight his rhythm guitar playing.

The songwriting includes a wide variety of influences, from singer Elton John and poet Lord Alfred Douglas (&quot;Lady Stardust&quot;), Little Richard (&quot;Suffragette City&quot;), &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; from the 1939 film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (&quot;Starman&quot;), and the Velvet Underground (&quot;Suffragette City&quot; and &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot;). As well as covering Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Around and Around&quot; during the sessions, Berry and Eddie Cochran influence the straightforward rock songs &quot;Hang On to Yourself&quot; and &quot;Suffragette City&quot;.

As well as including faster-paced numbers (&quot;Star&quot;), the album contains the minimalist tracks &quot;Five Years&quot; and &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Suicide&quot;. Both tracks are mostly led by Bowie&#x27;s voice, building intensity throughout their runtimes. While &quot;Five Years&quot; contains what author David Buckley calls a &quot;heartbeat-like&quot; drum beat, &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Suicide&quot; starts acoustic and builds to a lush arrangement, backed by an orchestra. Pegg describes &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Suicide&quot; as Bowie&#x27;s own &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;. The album also features some experimentation. &quot;Soul Love&quot; contains bongos, a hand-clap rhythm, and a saxophone solo from Bowie which Doggett calls &quot;relaxing&quot;. &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Easy&quot; features a harpsichord contribution from Rick Wakeman and backing vocals from Dana Gillespie, both of which were uncredited. Additionally &quot;Suffragette City&quot; features one of Bowie&#x27;s earliest uses of the ARP synthesiser, which later became the backbone of his late-1970s Berlin Trilogy.

==Artwork and packaging==

The album cover photograph was taken by photographer Brian Ward in monochrome; it was recoloured by illustrator Terry Pastor, a partner at the Main Artery design studio in Covent Garden with Bowie&#x27;s longtime friend George Underwood. Both Ward and Underwood had done the artwork and sleeve for &quot;Hunky Dory&quot;. The typography, initially pressed onto the original image using Letraset, was airbrushed by Pastor in red and yellow, and inset with white stars. Pegg said that unlike many of Bowie&#x27;s album sleeves, which feature close-ups of Bowie in a studio, the &quot;Ziggy&quot; image has Bowie almost in the foreground. Pegg describes the shot as: &quot;Bowie (or Ziggy) [stands] as a diminutive figure dwarfed by the shabby urban landscape, picked out in the light of a street lamp, framed by cardboard boxes and parked cars&quot;. Bowie is also holding a Gibson Les Paul guitar, which was owned by Arnold Corns guitarist Mark Pritchett and was the same guitar Pritchett used on Corns&#x27; recordings of &quot;Moonage Daydream&quot; and &quot;Hang On to Yourself&quot;. Similar to &quot;Hunky Dory&quot;″s cover, Bowie&#x27;s jumpsuit and hair, which was still his natural brown at the time, were artificially retinted. Pegg believes it gives the impression that the &quot;guitar-clutching visitor&quot; is from another dimension or world.
The photograph was taken during a photoshoot on 13 January 1972 at Ward&#x27;s Heddon Street studio in London, just off Regent Street. Suggesting they take photos outside before natural light was lost, the Spiders chose to stay inside while Bowie, who was ill with flu went outside just as it started to rain. Not willing to go very far, he stood outside the home of furriers &quot;K. West&quot; at 23 Heddon Street. According to Cann, the &quot;K&quot; stands for Konn, the surname of the company&#x27;s founder Henry Konn, and the &quot;West&quot; indicated it was on the west end of London. Soon after &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; became a massive success, the directors of K. West were displeased with their company&#x27;s name appearing on a pop album. However tensions eased and the company soon became accustomed to tourists photographing themselves on the doorstep. K. West moved out of the Heddon Street location in 1991 and the sign was taken down; according to Pegg, the site remains a popular &quot;place of pilgrimage&quot; for Bowie fans. Bowie said of the sign, &quot;It&#x27;s such a shame that sign [was removed]. People read so much into it. They thought &#x27;K. West&#x27; must be some sort of code for &#x27;quest.&#x27; It took on all these sort of mystical overtones&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the cover the 31st best album cover of all time in 2024.

The rear cover of the original vinyl LP contained the instruction &quot;To be played at maximum volume&quot; (stylised in all caps). The cover was among the ten chosen by the Royal Mail for a set of &quot;Classic Album Cover&quot; postage stamps issued in January 2010. In March 2012, The Crown Estate, which owns Regent Street and Heddon Street, installed a commemorative brown plaque at No. 23 in the same place as the &quot;K. West&quot; sign on the cover photo. The unveiling ceremony was attended by Woodmansey and Bolder; it was unveiled by Gary Kemp. The plaque was the first to be installed by The Crown Estate and is one of few plaques in the country devoted to fictional characters.

==Release and promotion==
Before Bowie changed his appearance to his Ziggy persona, he conducted an interview with journalist Michael Watts of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; where he came out as gay. Published on 22January 1972 with the headline &quot;Oh You Pretty Thing&quot;, the announcement garnered publicity in both Britain and America, although according to Pegg the declaration was not as monumental as latter-day accounts perceive. Nevertheless, Bowie was adopted as a gay icon in both countries, with &quot;Gay News&quot; describing him as &quot;probably the best rock musician in Britain&quot; and &quot;a potent spokesman&quot; for &quot;gay rock&quot;. Although Defries was reportedly &quot;shocked&quot; by the announcement, Scott believed Defries was behind it from the start, wanting to use it for publicity. According to Cann, the ambiguity surrounding Bowie&#x27;s sexuality drew press attention for his tour dates, the upcoming album and the subsequent &quot;John, I&#x27;m Only Dancing&quot; non-album single.

RCA released the lead single, &quot;Starman&quot;, on 28April 1972, backed by &quot;Suffragette City&quot;. The single sold steadily rather than spectacularly but earned many positive reviews. Promoting the upcoming album, Bowie, the Spiders, and keyboardist Nicky Graham performed the song on the Granada children&#x27;s music programme &quot;Lift Off with Ayshea&quot; on 15June; it was presented by Ayshea Brough. &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; was released a day later in the United Kingdom on 16June, with the catalogue number SF 8287. It sold 8,000 copies in Britain in its first week and entered the top 10 in its second week on the UK Albums Chart. The &quot;Lift Off&quot; performance was broadcast on 21June in a &quot;post-school&quot; time slot, where it was witnessed by thousands of British children. By 1July, &quot;Starman&quot; rose to number 41 on the UK Singles Chart, earning Bowie an invitation to perform on the BBC television programme &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;.

Bowie, the Spiders, and Graham performed &quot;Starman&quot; on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on 5July 1972. Bowie appeared in a brightly coloured rainbow jumpsuit, astronaut boots, and with &quot;shocking&quot; red hair while the Spiders wore blue, pink, scarlet, and gold velvet attire. During the performance, Bowie was relaxed and confident and wrapped his arm around Ronson&#x27;s shoulder. Shown the following day, the performance brought public attention to the album and helped solidify Bowie as a controversial pop icon. Buckley writes: &quot;Many fans date their conversion to all things Bowie to this &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; appearance.&quot; The performance was a defining moment for many British children. U2 singer Bono said in 2010, &quot;The first time I saw [Bowie] was singing &#x27;Starman&#x27; on television. It was like a creature falling from the sky. Americans put a man on the moon. We had our own British guy from space–with an Irish mother.&quot; After the performance, &quot;Starman&quot; charted at number 10 in the UK while peaking at number 65 in the US. On 11April 1974, impatient for a follow-up to &quot;Rebel Rebel&quot;, RCA belatedly released &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Suicide&quot; as a single. Buckley calls this move a &quot;dosh-catching exercise&quot;.

After dropping down the chart in late 1972, the album began climbing the chart again; by the end of 1972, the album had sold 95,968 units in Britain. It peaked at number five on the chart in February 1973. In Canada, the album reached number 59 and was on the charts for 27 weeks. In the US, the album peaked at number 75 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart in April 1973. The album returned to the UK chart on 31 January 1981, peaking at No. 73, amid the New Romantic era that Bowie had helped inspire. After Bowie&#x27;s death in 2016, the album reached a new peak of No. 21 in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It has sold an estimated 7.5 million copies worldwide, making it Bowie&#x27;s second-best-selling album after &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; (1983).

==Critical reception==
After its release, &quot;The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars&quot; received generally lukewarm reviews from contemporaneous critics. James Johnson of &quot;New Musical Express&quot; (&quot;NME&quot;) said the album has &quot;a bit more pessimism&quot; than on previous releases and called the songs &quot;fine&quot;. Watts said in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; that while &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; had &quot;no well-defined story line&quot;, it had &quot;odd songs and references to the business of being a pop star that overall add up to a strong sense of biographical drama.&quot; In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, writer Richard Cromelin thought the album was good, but he felt that it and its style might not be of lasting interest: &quot;We should all say a brief prayer that his fortunes are not made to rise and fall with the fate of the &#x27;drag-rock&#x27; syndrome.&quot;

Some reviewers gave overwhelming praise to the album. A writer for &quot;Circus&quot; magazine wrote that the album is &quot;from start to finish... of dazzling intensity and mad design&quot;, and called it a &quot;stunning work of genius&quot;. Referencing the album, Jack Lloyd of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; declared that &quot;David Bowie is one of the most creative, compelling writers around today&quot;. The &quot;Evening Standard&quot;″s Andrew Bailey agreed, praising the songwriting, performances, production, and &quot;operatic&quot; music. Robert Hilburn positively compared &quot;Ziggy&quot; to the Who&#x27;s &quot;Tommy&quot; (1969) in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, describing the music as &quot;exciting, literate and imaginative&quot;.

Jon Tiven of &quot;Phonograph Record&quot; praised the album, calling it &quot;the &quot;Aftermath&quot; of the Seventies&quot;, where there are no filler tracks. He further called Bowie &quot;one of the most distinctive personalities in rock&quot; believing that should Bowie ever become a star &quot;of the &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; magnitude&quot;, he deserves it. In &quot;Creem&quot;, Dave Marsh considered &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; Bowie&#x27;s best record up to that point, stating &quot;I can&#x27;t see him stopping here for long&quot;. &quot;Creem&quot; later placed the album at the top of their end of year list. Meanwhile, Lillian Roxon of &quot;New York Sunday News&quot; chose &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; over the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; as the best album of the year up to that point, even considering Bowie &quot;the Elvis of the Seventies&quot;.

Some reviews were more negative. A writer for &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine, who praised &quot;Hunky Dory&quot;, opined: &quot;It would be a pity if this album was the one to make it... much of it sounds the work of a competent plagiarist.&quot; Writing for &quot;The Times&quot;, Richard Williams felt that the persona was just for show and Bowie &quot;doesn&#x27;t mean it&quot;. Although Nick Kent of &quot;Oz&quot; magazine enjoyed the album as a whole, he felt the character of Ziggy Stardust did not quite come together as well, stating that Bowie was &quot;over-reaching himself&quot;. Doggett said that this was the general verdict for reviewers who had enjoyed the &quot;dense, philosophical songs&quot; of Bowie&#x27;s previous releases, as they could not relate to the &quot;mythology&quot; of &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;.

==Tour==


Bowie began touring as a promotion of &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;. The first part began in the United Kingdom and ran from 29January to 7September 1972. A show at the Toby Jug pub in Tolworth on 10February of the same year was hugely popular, catapulting him to stardom and creating, as described by Buckley, a &quot;cult of Bowie&quot;. Bowie retained the Ziggy character for the tour. His love of acting led to his total immersion in the characters he created for his music. After acting the same role over an extended period, it became impossible for him to separate Ziggy from his own offstage character. Bowie said that Ziggy &quot;wouldn&#x27;t leave me alone for years. That was when it all started to go sour... My whole personality was affected. It became very dangerous. I really did have doubts about my sanity.&quot;

After arriving in America in September 1972, he told &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine that he began having trouble differentiating between himself and Ziggy. Fearing that Ziggy would define his career, Bowie quickly developed a new persona for his follow-up album, &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; (1973), which was mostly recorded from December 1972 to January 1973 between legs of the tour. Described by Bowie as &quot;Ziggy goes to America&quot;, &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; contained songs he wrote while travelling to and across America during the earlier part of the Ziggy tour. The character of Aladdin Sane was far less optimistic, rather engaging in aggressive sexual activities and heavy drugs. &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; became Bowie&#x27;s first number-one album in the UK.

The tour lasted 18 months and passed through North America; it then went to Japan to promote &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot;. The final date of the tour was 3July 1973, which was performed at the Hammersmith Odeon in London. At this show, Bowie made the sudden surprise announcement that the show would be &quot;the last show that we&#x27;ll ever do&quot;, later understood to mean that he was retiring his Ziggy Stardust persona. The performance was documented by filmmaker D. A. Pennebaker in a documentary and concert film, which premiered in 1979 and commercially released in 1983 as &quot;Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars&quot;, with an accompanying soundtrack album titled &quot;Ziggy Stardust: The Motion Picture&quot;. After being widely bootlegged, a show performed in Santa Monica, California, on 20October 1972 was officially issued in 2008 as &quot;Live Santa Monica &#x27;72&quot;.

==Other projects==
While recording &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;, Bowie offered &quot;Suffragette City&quot; to the band Mott the Hoople, who were on the verge of breaking up, but they declined. So Bowie wrote a new song for them, &quot;All the Young Dudes&quot;. With Bowie producing, the band recorded the track in May 1972. Bowie would also produce the band&#x27;s fifth album named after the song. Bowie would perform the song on the Ziggy Stardust Tour and record his own version during the &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; sessions. The tour took a toll on Bowie&#x27;s mental health; it marked the beginning of his longtime cocaine addiction. During this time, he underwent other projects that contributed to growing exhaustion. In August 1972, he co-produced Lou Reed&#x27;s &quot;Transformer&quot; with Ronson in London in between tour commitments. Two months later, he mixed the Stooges&#x27; 1973 album &quot;Raw Power&quot; in Hollywood during the first US tour; Bowie had become friends with the band&#x27;s frontman Iggy Pop.

In November 1973, Bowie conducted an interview with the writer William S. Burroughs for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. He spoke of a musical based on &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;, saying: &quot;Forty scenes are in it and it would be nice if the characters and actors learned the scenes and we all shuffled them around in a hat the afternoon of the performance and just performed it as the scenes come out.&quot; The musical, considered by Pegg a &quot;retrograde step&quot;, fell through, but Bowie salvaged two songs he had written for it—&quot;Rebel Rebel&quot; and &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll with Me&quot;—for his 1974 album &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot;.

==Influence and legacy==

&quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; is widely considered to be Bowie&#x27;s breakthrough album. Although Pegg believes &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; was not Bowie&#x27;s greatest work, he said that it had the biggest cultural impact of all his records. Trynka stated that besides the music itself, the album &quot;works overall as a drama that demands suspension of disbelief&quot;, making each listener a member of Ziggy&#x27;s audience. He believes that decades later, &quot;it&#x27;s a thrill to be a part of the action.&quot;

In retrospectives for &quot;The Independent&quot; and &quot;Record Collector&quot;, Barney Hoskyns and Mark Paytress respectively, contrasted Bowie against Marc Bolan, who became a star a year before Bowie and influenced his glam persona of Ziggy Stardust, but who was unable to stay in a position of stardom in the long run due to a lack of adaptability. Bowie, on the other hand, made change a theme of his entire career, progressing through the 1970s with different musical genres, from the glam rock of &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; to the Thin White Duke of &quot;Station to Station&quot; (1976). Hoskyns argued that through the Ziggy persona, Bowie &quot;took glam rock to places that the Sweet only had nightmares about&quot;. &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot;″s Dave Swanson stated that as the public were adapting to glam, Bowie decided to move on, abandoning the persona within two years. Writing on Bowie&#x27;s influence on the glam rock genre as a whole, Joe Lynch of &quot;Billboard&quot; called both &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; and &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; records that &quot;ensured his long-term career and infamy&quot;. He argues that both albums &quot;transcended&quot; the genre, are &quot;works of art&quot;, and are not just &quot;glam classics&quot;, but &quot;rock classics&quot;. In 2002, Chris Jones of BBC Music argued that with the album, Bowie fashioned the template for the &quot;truly modern pop star&quot; that had yet to be matched.

Before their formation, the members of the English gothic rock band Bauhaus watched Bowie&#x27;s performance of &quot;Starman&quot; on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, recalling that it was &quot;a significant and profound turning point in their lives&quot;. The band thereafter idolised Bowie and subsequently covered &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; in 1982. In 2004, the Brazilian singer Seu Jorge contributed five cover versions of Bowie songs, three of them from &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;, to the soundtrack for the film &quot;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou&quot;. Jorge later rerecorded the songs as a solo album called &quot;The Life Aquatic Studio Sessions&quot;. On that album&#x27;s liner notes, Bowie wrote, &quot;Had Seu Jorge not recorded my songs in Portuguese I would never have heard this new level of beauty which he has imbued them with.&quot; In 2016, Jorge toured performing his Portuguese covers of Bowie&#x27;s songs in front of sailboat-shaped screens. The American musician Saul Williams named his 2007 album &quot;The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!&quot; after the album. In June 2017, an extinct species of wasp was named &quot;Archaeoteleia astropulvis&quot; after Ziggy Stardust (&quot;astropulvis&quot; is Latin for &quot;stardust&quot;). The American singer Chappell Roan&#x27;s stage name and persona has been compared to the Ziggy Stardust character and the title of her album &quot;The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess&quot; (2023) was inspired by &quot;The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars&quot;.

===Retrospective reviews===

Retrospectively, &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; has received critical acclaim and is recognised as one of the most important rock albums. When reviewing the 30th anniversary edition of &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; in 2002, Daryl Easlea of &quot;Record Collector&quot; called the album &quot;a monumental piece of work&quot;, praising the backing band of the Spiders and noting its cultural impact. Jones noted the album&#x27;s importance in rock music 30 years later and credits Scott and the Spiders as elements that elevated the album to the status it has received, finding it to be the &quot;peak&quot; of that group&#x27;s creativity and achievements. &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote that the record serves as a reminder to record companies that &quot;hopelessly idiosyncratic and excessively provocative&quot; music can initially be disliked but later celebrated as &quot;timeless&quot;. Writing for &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; in 2004, Barry Walsh said that aside from the &quot;pop culture phenomenon&quot; the album has become, the songs are among Bowie&#x27;s finest and most memorable, and ultimately called the album &quot;truly timeless&quot;. Erlewine wrote for AllMusic: &quot;Bowie succeeds not in spite of his pretensions but because of them, and &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;–familiar in structure, but alien in performance–is the first time his vision and execution met in such a grand, sweeping fashion.&quot; Greg Kot writing for &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, described the album as a &quot;guitar-fueled song cycle&quot;, saying it &quot;enacted the deaths of Joplin, Morrison, Hendrix, and the &#x27;60s&quot; and that it &quot;presaged the dread, decadence and eroticism of a new era.&quot;

Many reviewers have considered the album to be a masterpiece. Reviewing its 40th anniversary, Jordan Blum of &quot;PopMatters&quot; writes: &quot;It&#x27;s easy to appreciate how &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; was a revolutionary record in 1972, and it&#x27;s still as vibrant, significant, and enjoyably today.&quot; In a 2013 readers&#x27; poll for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; was voted Bowie&#x27;s greatest album. The magazine argues that it &quot;is the Bowie album that will be in history books&quot;. Reviewing in 2015, Douglas Wolk of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; commented that while it has an incoherent concept overall, it still remains a great collection of tracks, &quot;overflowing with huge riffs and huger personae&quot;. Ian Fortnam wrote for &quot;Classic Rock&quot; in 2016 that &quot;&quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; is David Bowie&#x27;s crowning achievement. Obviously, contrarians will insist other albums have proven to carry greater cultural weight or defined his artistic legacy better, but revisit &quot;Ziggy&quot; today and its visceral and emotional impact remains undeniable. Especially when played, as advised, &#x27;at maximum volume&#x27;... &quot;Ziggy&quot; reflected and shaped its time and its audience like no other album&quot;.

===Rankings===
&quot;The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars&quot; has frequently appeared on numerous lists of the greatest albums of all time by many publications. In 1987 as part of their 20th anniversary, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it number six on &quot;The 100 Best Albums of the Last Twenty Years&quot;. In 1997, &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; was named the 20th greatest album of all time in a &quot;Music of the Millennium&quot; poll conducted in the UK. It was voted number 11 and 27 in the second and third editions of English writer Colin Larkin&#x27;s book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;, respectively. He said in the second edition: &quot;The blend of rock star persona and alien creature defining &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; was probably [Bowie&#x27;s] finest creation&quot;. In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it 35th on their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. It retained the same position on the updated 2012 list, and was re-ranked 40th in 2020. In 2004, it was placed at number 81 in &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s list of the 100 Best Albums of the 1970s, while &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; included it in a similar list of the 100 best rock albums from the 1970s in 2015, calling it &quot;a masterstroke of genius myth-making&quot;. In 2006, &quot;Q&quot; magazine readers ranked it as the 41st best album ever, while &quot;Time&quot; magazine chose it as one of the 100 best albums of all time. In 2013, &quot;NME&quot; ranked the album 23rd in their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, writing: Ziggy Stardust&#x27;... demands to be engaged with from start to finish&quot;. In Apple Music&#x27;s 2024 list of the 100 Best Albums, the album ranked number 24.

The album was also included in the 2018 edition of Robert Dimery&#x27;s book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In March 2017, the album was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry by the United States National Recording Preservation Board, which designates it as a sound recording that has had significant cultural, historical, or aesthetic impact in American life.

==Reissues==
&quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; was first released on CD in November 1984 by RCA. Dr. Toby Mountain later remastered the album at Northeastern Digital Recording in Southborough, Massachusetts from the original master tapes for Rykodisc. The reissue was released on 6 June 1990, with five bonus tracks. It charted for four weeks on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at number 25. The album was remastered again by Peter Mew and released on 28 September 1999 by Virgin.

On 16 July 2002, a two-disc version was released by EMI/Virgin. The first in a series of &quot;30th Anniversary 2CD Editions&quot;, this release included a newly remastered version as its first CD. The second disc contained twelve tracks, most of which had been previously released on CD as bonus tracks on the 1990–1992 reissues. The new mix of &quot;Moonage Daydream&quot; was originally done for a 1998 Dunlop television commercial.

On 4 June 2012, a &quot;40th Anniversary Edition&quot; was released by EMI/Virgin. This edition was remastered by original Trident Studios&#x27; engineer Ray Staff. The 2012 remaster was made available on CD and on a special, limited edition format of vinyl and DVD, featuring the new remaster on an LP, together with 2003 remixes of the album by Scott (5.1 and stereo mixes) on DVD-Audio. The latter included bonus 2003 Scott mixes of &quot;Moonage Daydream&quot; (instrumental), &quot;The Supermen&quot;, &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot;, and &quot;Sweet Head&quot;.

The 2012 remaster of the album and the 2003 remix (stereo mix only) were both included in the Parlophone box set &quot;Five Years (1969–1973)&quot;, released on 25 September 2015. The album with its 2012 remastering, was also rereleased separately in 2015–2016, in CD, vinyl, and digital formats. Parlophone released the separate LP on 26 February 2016 on 180g vinyl. On 16 June 2017, Parlophone reissued the album as a limited edition LP pressed on gold vinyl.

Two years later, the label announced the release of &quot;Waiting in the Sky&quot;, an alternate version of the album based on a tracklist made before the recording of &quot;Starman&quot;, for Record Store Day 2024. The same year, on 14 June 2024, Parlophone released a five-disc box set entitled &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Star!&quot;, chronicling Bowie&#x27;s Ziggy Stardust period, featuring various unreleased tracks, including demos, outtakes and live performances.

<text>Ali Hassan Salameh (, ; 1 April 1941 – 22 January 1979; code name: Abu Hassan) was a Palestinian militant who was the chief of operations for Black September and founder of Force 17. He was assassinated in January 1979 as part of an assassination campaign by Mossad.

== Biography ==
Salameh was born in the Palestinian town of Qula, near the city of Jaffa, to a wealthy family on 1 April 1941. He was the son of Shaykh Hassan Salameh, who was killed in action by the Israeli army during the 1948 Palestine war near Lydda. Ali Salameh was educated in Germany and is thought to have received his military training in Cairo and Moscow.

He was known for flaunting his wealth, being surrounded by women and driving sports cars, and having popular appeal among Palestinian young men; his nickname underlined his popularity—the &quot;Red Prince&quot; (). He served as the security chief of Fatah. After the Munich massacre during the 1972 Olympic Games, he was hunted by the Israeli Mossad during its assassination campaign. In 1973, Mossad agents killed an innocent Moroccan waiter, Ahmed Bouchiki, in what became known as the Lillehammer affair in Norway, mistaking Bouchiki for Salameh, and resulting in the arrest of some of the Israeli agents.

As a result of the failure in Lillehammer and his alleged CIA protection, Salameh felt relatively safe. Having lived under cover in various parts of the Middle East and Europe, in 1978, he married Georgina Rizk, a Lebanese celebrity who had been Miss Universe seven years earlier. The couple spent their honeymoon in Hawaii and then stayed at Disneyland in California. When Rizk became pregnant, she returned to her flat in Beirut where Salameh also rented a separate apartment. Rizk was six months pregnant at the time of his death. Their son Ali Salameh is a political science graduate who studied in Canada. By a prior marriage he was a grandson-in-law of Mohammad Amin al-Husayni. He had two sons from his first marriage to Um Hassan.

Salameh served as the key bridge between the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) from 1970 until his death after being recruited as a CIA asset by Robert Ames. The PLO, at the request of the US, had undertaken steps to help ensure the security of both the US Embassy—Salameh responded by posting a PLO guard unit there—and, more generally, American citizens resident in Lebanon. The contacts later developed more extensively as the PLO offered its intelligence assistance in regard to larger regional issues. The US had undertaken with Israel to avoid contacts with the PLO, but US security interests under Gerald Ford, on the advice of Henry Kissinger, enabled an unofficial relationship which, when discovered by Israel, deeply disturbed Israeli officials. When asked by the Israelis, US officials denied the relationship. The desire to disrupt the channels between the US and the PLO was one of the motivations behind his assassination.

Salameh received dozens of CIA alerts of the Mossad&#x27;s intention to assassinate him. The CIA also provided him with encrypted communications equipment and considered sending him an armored car. He was also warned by the CIA that his practice of driving around Beirut in convoys of vehicles carrying bodyguards left him vulnerable to an Israeli assassination.

==Assassination==
In June 1978, the Mossad intensified its efforts to assassinate Salameh, codenamed Operation Maveer (Burner). Michael Harari was in charge of the operation. A Lebanese agent working for Israeli military intelligence supplied key details on Salameh&#x27;s routine. Mossad operatives were subsequently deployed to Beirut to monitor Salameh, one of whom enrolled at the gym where he regularly exercised and befriended him. As many as fourteen Mossad agents were involved in the operation. One of the agents believed to be involved was Erika Chambers, who arrived in Beirut in October 1978 posing as an NGO staffer wishing to assist Palestinian orphans. She rented a flat overlooking Salameh&#x27;s apartment. Two other agents involved in the operation using the aliases Peter Scriver and Roland Kolberg entered Lebanon on British and Canadian passports respectively. 

From October 1978, over a period of six weeks, Mossad agents observed Salameh, noting that he spent most afternoons with Rizk at her apartment in Snoubra, West Beirut, and when not in meetings spent time at the gym and at a sauna. An initial plan to kill him with a bomb attack at the sauna was vetoed for fear of excessive civilian casualties. The Mossad decided to kill him with a car bomb. Explosives were placed in the trunk of a Volkswagen which was then parked close to Salameh&#x27;s apartment block.

On 22 January 1979, Salameh was in a convoy of two Chevrolet station wagons headed from Rizk&#x27;s flat to his mother&#x27;s for a birthday party. Chambers was on her balcony painting, with the Volkswagen parked below on Rue Verdun (an upscale commercial and residential street in Beirut). As Salameh&#x27;s convoy passed the Volkswagen at 3:35 pm and turned onto Rue Madame Curie, 100 kg of explosive attached to the car by a fellow Mossad agent was remotely exploded, either by Chambers or on her signal to another Mossad agent. Harari watched the explosion through a telescope from an Israeli Navy missile boat off the coast of Beirut.

The detonation left Salameh conscious, but severely wounded and in great pain, having pieces of steel shrapnel embedded in his head and throughout his body. He was rushed to the American University of Beirut, where he died on the operating table at 4:03 p.m. Salameh&#x27;s four bodyguards were also killed in the explosion. Four bystanders were also killed. In addition, at least 16 people were injured in the blast. Immediately following the operation, the Mossad agents involved in the operation left the country. Chambers and two other agents were picked up by boat on the Beirut shore and taken to an Israeli missile boat.

===Funeral===
Salameh was buried in Beirut after a public funeral ceremony attended by Yasser Arafat and about 20,000 Palestinians on 24 January 1979.

<text>Sky Group Limited is a British media and telecommunications conglomerate owned by Comcast and headquartered in London. It has operations in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Italy. Sky is Europe&#x27;s largest media company and pay-TV broadcaster by revenue (), with 23 million subscribers and more than 31,000 employees as of 2019. The company is primarily involved in satellite television, producing and broadcasting. The current CEO is Dana Strong.

Initially formed in 1990 by the equal merger of Sky Television and British Satellite Broadcasting, BSkyB became the UK&#x27;s largest digital pay television company. In 2014, after completing the acquisition of Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland, the merged company changed its name to Sky plc.

Prior to November 2018, Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s 21st Century Fox owned a 39.14% controlling stake in Sky Group; In December 2016, 21st Century Fox made a bid to acquire the remaining shares of Sky, pending government approval. This move followed an earlier attempt by News Corporation that was derailed by the News International phone hacking scandal. During a subsequent bidding war, Comcast emerged as the winning bidder, acquiring Sky in 2018 for £17.28 per share. NBCUniversal, Sky&#x27;s sister company, has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Comcast since 2013.

Before the acquisition by Comcast, Sky was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index and had a market capitalisation of approximately £18.75 billion (€26.76 billion) as of 2018.

==History==
===BSkyB===
====Formation====

British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB) was formed by the merger of Sky Television and British Satellite Broadcasting on 2 November 1990. Both companies had begun to struggle financially and were suffering financial losses as they competed against each other for viewers. &quot;The Guardian&quot; later characterised the merger as &quot;effectively a takeover by News Corporation&quot;.

The merger was investigated by the Office of Fair Trading and was cleared a month later since many of the represented views were more concerned about contractual arrangements which had nothing to do with competition. The Independent Broadcasting Authority was not consulted about the deal; after approval, the IBA demanded precise details about the merger, stated they were considering the repercussions of the deal to ultimately determine whether BSB contracts were null and void. On 17 November, the IBA decided to terminate BSB&#x27;s contract, but not immediately, as it was deemed unfair to 120,000 viewers who had bought BSB devices.

Sam Chisholm was appointed CEO in a bid to reorganise the new company, which, continued to make losses of £10 million per week. The defunct BSB&#x27;s HQ, Marco Polo House were sold, 39% of the new company&#x27;s employees were made redundant to leave just under 1000 employees, many of the new senior BSkyB executive roles were given to Sky personnel with many BSB leaving the company. In April the nine Sky/BSB channels had been condensed into five, with EuroSport being dropped soon after the Sky Sports launch. Chisholm also renegotiated the merged company&#x27;s expensive deals with the Hollywood studios, slashing the minimum guaranteed payments. The defunct &quot;Marcopolo I&quot; satellite was sold in December 1993 to Sweden&#x27;s &quot;NSAB&quot;, and &quot;Marcopolo II&quot; went to Norway&#x27;s &quot;Telenor&quot; in July 1992 after the Independent Television Commission (ITC) was unable to find new companies to take over the BSB licences and compete with BSkyB. News International received 50%, Pearson PLC 17.5%, Chargeurs 17.5%, Granada 12%, Reed International 2% of the new shares in the company.

By September 1991, the weekly losses had been reduced to $30M a week, Rupert Murdoch said &quot;there were strong financial marketing and political reason[s] for making the compromise merger instead of letting BSB die. Many of the lessons had been learnt with more than half the running cost of the combined company&quot;. Further cuts in losses were a direct result of 313,000 new customers joining during the first half of 1991. By March 1992, BSkyB posted its first operating profits, of £100,000 per week, with £3.8 million weekly from subscriptions and £1 million from advertising, but continued to be burdened with £1.28 billion of debt. Stockbroker firm James Capel forecast BSkyB would still be indebted in 2000.

In the autumn of 1991, talks were held for the broadcast rights for Premier League for a five-year period, from the 1992 season. British television network ITV were the current rights holders for the Football League, and fought hard to gain the new rights. ITV had increased its offer from £18m to £34m per year to obtain the new rights. BSkyB joined forces with the BBC to make a counter bid. The BBC was given the highlights of most of the matches, while BSkyB paid £304m for the Premier League rights, giving them a monopoly of all live matches, up to 60 per year from the 1992–93 season. Murdoch has described sport as a &quot;battering ram&quot; for pay-television, providing a strong customer base. A few weeks after the deal, ITV went to the High court to get an injunction as it believed their details were leaked before the decision was taken. ITV also asked the Office of Fair Trading to also investigate since it believed Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s media empire via the newspapers had influenced the deal. A few days later neither action took effect, ITV believed BSkyB was telephoned and informed of its £262m bid, and the Premier League advised BSkyB to increase its counter bid. BSkyB retained the rights paying £670m for the 1997–2001 deal, but was challenged by On Digital for the rights from 2001 to 2004, thus it was forced to pay £1.1 billion which gave it 66 live games a year. Following a lengthy legal battle with the European Commission, which deemed the exclusivity of the rights to be against the interests of competition and the consumer, BSkyB&#x27;s monopoly came to an end from the 2007–08 season. In May 2006, the Irish broadcaster Setanta Sports was awarded two of the six Premiership packages that the English FA offered to broadcasters. Sky picked up the remaining four for £1.3bn.

====Becoming a public limited company====
In October 1994, BSkyB announced its plans to float the company on the UK and US stock exchanges, selling off 20% of the company. The stock flotation reduced Murdoch&#x27;s holding to 40 per cent and raised £900m, which allowed the company to cut its debt in half. Sam Chisholm said &quot;By any standards this is an excellent result, in every area of the company has performed strongly&quot;. Chisholm became one of the world&#x27;s most highly paid television executives.

In 1995, BSkyB opened its second customer management centre at Dunfermline, Scotland, in addition to its original centre at Livingston which opened in 1989. BSkyB entered the FTSE 100 index, operation profits increased to £155M a year, and Pearson sold off its 17.5% stake in the company.

Sam Chisholm resigned from BSkyB due to a rift with Rupert Murdoch in June 1997. A week later, Murdoch was quoted as saying &quot;I cannot understand the fuss; BSkyB was grossly overpriced&quot;, which caused further rifts with the new management.

In 1997, BSkyB formed a partnership with Carlton and Granada to bid for the right for the new digital terrestrial network. In June, it was awarded the right to start the service, ONdigital, under the condition BSkyB withdrew from the group&#x27;s bid. In February 2003 BSkyB wished to renegotiate its deal with MTV to reduce its payment from £20m. Chief executive Tony Ball said &quot;We&#x27;re definitely prepared to stare them down if we can&#x27;t get a sensible deal. MTV, and other channels, have done particularly well out of the growth of Sky but the opportunity for savings is now there and Sky will be taking it,&quot; he added. &quot;MTV has done extremely well out of that original deal.&quot; On 17 April 2003 BSkyB launched its own range of music channels Scuzz, Flaunt and The Amp, as part of its plan to create its own original channels for the platform. Within 18 months the channels failed to make impact, and were outsourced to the Chart Show Channels company.

Shortly afterwards it acquired Artsworld, giving a majority of subscribers full access to the channel. The buyout was part of James Murdoch&#x27;s strategy to improve the perceptions BSkyB which could lead to potential new subscribers. John Cassy, the channel manager of Artsworld, said: &quot;It is great news for the arts that a dedicated cultural channel will be available to millions of households.&quot;

In early 2007 Freeview overtook Sky Digital with nearly 200,000 more subscribers at the end of 2006, while cable broadcaster Virgin Media had three million customers. In July 2007, BSkyB announced the takeover of Amstrad for £125m, a 23.7% premium on its market capitalisation.

BSkyB and Virgin Media announced that they had reached agreement for the acquisition by BSkyB of Virgin Media Television. Virgin1 was also a part of the deal and was rebranded as Channel One on 3 September 2010, as the Virgin name was not licensed to Sky. The new carriage deals are understood to be for up to nine years. The deal was completed in July 2010 and Virgin Media Television was renamed Living TV Group.

In June 2010, News Corporation made a bid for complete ownership of BSkyB. However, following the News International phone hacking scandal, critics and politicians began to question the appropriateness of the proposed takeover. The resulting reaction forced News Corp. to withdraw its bid for the company in July 2011. The scandal forced the resignation of James Murdoch, who was the chairman of both BSkyB and News International, from his executive positions in the UK, with Nicholas Ferguson taking over as Chairman of BSkyB. In September 2012, Ofcom ruled that BSkyB was still fit to hold broadcast licenses in the UK, but criticised James Murdoch&#x27;s handling of the scandal. On 28 June 2013, News Corporation was split into two publicly-traded companies; the company&#x27;s publishing operations (including News International, renamed News UK) and broadcasting operations in Australia were spun into a new company known as News Corp, while the company&#x27;s broadcast media assets, including its 39.14% stake in Sky, were renamed 21st Century Fox.

====European acquisitions====
On 12 May 2014, BSkyB confirmed that it was in talks with its largest shareholder, 21st Century Fox, about acquiring 21st Century Fox&#x27;s 57.4% stake in Sky Deutschland and its 100% stake in Sky Italia. The enlarged company (dubbed &quot;Sky Europe&quot; in the media) would consolidate 21st Century Fox&#x27;s European digital TV assets into one company. The £4.9 billion takeover deal was formally announced on 25 July, where BSkyB would acquire 21st Century Fox&#x27;s stakes in Sky Deutschland and Sky Italia. BSkyB also made a required takeover offer to Sky Deutschland&#x27;s minority shareholders, resulting in BSkyB acquiring 89.71% of Sky Deutschland&#x27;s share capital. The acquisitions were completed on 13 November.

===Sky plc===
British Sky Broadcasting Group plc changed its name to Sky plc to reflect the European acquisitions, and the United Kingdom operations were renamed Sky UK Limited. Sky plc bought out the remaining minority shareholders in Sky Deutschland during 2015, using a squeeze-out procedure to obtain the remaining shares and delist Sky Deutschland on 15 September 2015.

====Competition around being acquired====
On 9 December 2016, 21st Century Fox announced that it had made an offer to acquire the remainder of Sky plc for £11.7 billion at a value of £10.75 per-share. It marked Fox&#x27;s second attempt to take over Sky, as its previous attempt under News Corporation was affected by the News International scandal. The two companies reached an agreement on the deal on 15 December, subject to regulatory approval.

Ofcom expressed concern that this purchase would give the Murdoch family &quot;material influence over news providers with a significant presence across all key platforms&quot; and &quot;increased influence over the UK news agenda and the political process&quot;. However, the regulator did deem that a Fox-owned Sky would be &quot;fit and proper&quot; to hold broadcast licences, despite the recent sexual harassment controversies that had emerged at the US Fox News Channel, as there was no evidence to the contrary. Avaaz opposed Ofcom&#x27;s opinion, stating that the regulator &quot;made mistake after mistake in deciding to give the Murdochs a clean bill of health to take over more of our media&quot;.

The Walt Disney Company announced on 14 December 2017 that it would acquire 21st Century Fox, including its stake in Sky plc but barring specific US assets. Fox stated that this purchase would &quot;not alter [its] full commitment and obligation to conclude our proposed transaction&quot;. Analysts suggested that Disney&#x27;s proposed transaction could ease regulatory concerns over Fox&#x27;s purchase of Sky, as the company will eventually lose its ties to the Murdoch family. Disney has a narrower scope of media ownership in the country than the Murdoch family. Sky already has a relationship with Disney for its Sky Cinema service, holding pay television rights to its films in the United Kingdom and operating a dedicated Sky Cinema channel devoted to Disney content.

A preliminary report by the Competition and Markets Authority issued January 2018 called for the insulation or outright divestment of Sky News as a condition of the purchase, so that it is editorially independent from the Murdoch family. Sky had threatened to reevaluate the channel&#x27;s continued operations if they &quot;unduly impeded merger and/or other corporate opportunities available in relation to Sky&#x27;s broader business&quot;. The channel has operated on a loss of at least £40 million per-year. In February 2018, Fox proposed the establishment of an independent editorial board, and committing to fund the network for at least 10 years. This commitment would be inherited by Disney after the completion of its purchase of 21st Century Fox. On 3 April 2018, Fox stated that Disney had &quot;expressed an interest in acquiring Sky News&quot;, which would not be conditional on its proposal to acquire 21st Century Fox.

A bidding war began 25 April 2018, when the competing US media and telecoms conglomerate Comcast (owner of NBCUniversal), announced a counter-offer for Sky at £12.50 per-share, or approximately £22.1 billion. NBCUniversal CEO Steve Burke stated that purchasing Sky would roughly double its presence in English-speaking markets, and allow for synergies between the respective networks and studios of NBCUniversal and Sky.

On 5 June 2018, Culture Secretary Matt Hancock cleared both 21st Century Fox and Comcast&#x27;s respective offers to acquire Sky plc. Fox&#x27;s offer was contingent on the divestiture of Sky News. On 12 June 2018, Comcast announced a US$65 billion counter-offer to acquire the 21st Century Fox assets that Disney had offered to purchase. However, Fox subsequently agreed to an increased, US$71.3 billion offer from Disney instead. On 15 June 2018, the European Commission gave antitrust clearance to Comcast&#x27;s offer to purchase Sky, citing that in terms of their current assets in Europe, there would be limited impact on competition. Comcast included a 10-year commitment to the operations and funding of Sky News similar to that of Disney&#x27;s offer. On 19 June 2018, Disney formally agreed to acquire Sky News as part of Fox&#x27;s proposed bid, with a 15-year commitment to increase its annual funding from £90 million to £100 million.

On 11 July 2018, Fox increased its bid for Sky to £14.00 per share, valuing it at £24.5 billion. Comcast subsequently counterbid just hours later with an offer at £14.75 per-share, valued at £26 billion. On 19 July 2018, after Fox agreed to a Disney counter-offer, it was reported that Comcast had abandoned its bid for 21st Century Fox to focus solely on Sky.

On 20 September 2018, the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers ordered that a blind auction be held &quot;in order to provide an orderly framework for the resolution of this competitive situation&quot;. In this process, Fox, followed by Comcast, made new cash-only bids for Sky. After these first two rounds of bidding, there would be a third round where both companies could make new offers. However, the third round of bidding would only be binding if both companies make a bid. The results were to be revealed on 22 September, and be confirmed by the start of trading on 24 September. Comcast won the auction with a bid of £17.28 per-share, beating Fox&#x27;s bid of £15.67. Sky plc had until 11 October to formally accept this offer.

Following its auction victory, Comcast began to acquire Sky shares from the open market. On 26 September 2018, Fox subsequently announced its intent to sell all of its shares in Sky plc to Comcast for £12 billion. On 4 October 2018, Fox completed the sale of their shares, giving Comcast a 76.8% controlling stake at the time.

===Sky Group Ltd===
On 12 October 2018, Comcast announced it would compulsorily acquire the rest of Sky after its bid gained acceptances from 95.3% of the broadcaster&#x27;s shareholders with the company being delisted by early 2019. Sky was delisted on 7 November 2018 after Comcast acquired all remaining shares.

In August 2021, Sky Group signed a deal with ViacomCBS to launch Paramount+ in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, Germany, Switzerland and Austria by 2022. On 3 May 2022, it was announced that Paramount+ will launch on 22 June 2022 for Sky customers in Ireland and the United Kingdom.

==Management==

* &quot;Executive Chairman:&quot; Jeremy Darroch (since January 2021)
* &quot;Chief Executive:&quot; Dana Strong (since January 2021)

=== List of former chairmen ===

# Rupert Murdoch (1990–2007)
# James Murdoch (2007–2012)
# Nicholas Ferguson (2012–2016)
# James Murdoch (2016–2018); second term

=== List of former chief executives ===

# Sam Chisholm (1990–1997)
# Mark Booth (1997–1999)
# Tony Ball (1999–2003)
# James Murdoch (2003–2007)
# Jeremy Darroch (2007–2021)

The first CEO of BSkyB was Sam Chisholm, who was CEO of Sky TV before the merger. Chisholm served in this position until 1997. He was followed by Mark Booth who was credited with leading the company through the introduction of Sky. Tony Ball was appointed in 1999 and completed the company&#x27;s analogue to digital conversion. He is also credited with returning the company to profit and bringing subscriber numbers to new heights. In 2003, Ball announced his resignation and James Murdoch, son of Rupert Murdoch was announced as his successor. This appointment caused allegations of nepotism from shareholders.

On 7 December 2007, it was announced that Rupert Murdoch would be stepping down as BSkyB&#x27;s non-executive chairman and would be replaced by his son, James. In turn, James stepped down as CEO of BSkyB, to be replaced by Jeremy Darroch. It was estimated that Darroch would earn around £38.2 million from selling Sky to Comcast. He sold his 775,772 shares in Sky worth £13.4 million and would cash in on previously awarded bonus shares.

In January 2021, it was announced that Darroch would be standing down as CEO, and will become executive chairman of Sky for the remainder of 2021, and will then be an advisor to the company. He will be succeeded as CEO by Dana Strong.

The current company directors are Comcast personnel: Michael J Cavanagh (Comcast senior VP &amp; CFO), Arthur R Block (legal counsel) and David L Cohen (senior VP &amp; CDO).

===Stake in ITV===
ITV plc has been the subject of a flurry of rumoured take-over and merger bids since it was formed. For example, on 9 November 2006, announced that it had approached ITV plc about a proposed merger. The merger was effectively blocked by BSkyB on 17 November 2006 when it controversially bought a 17.9% stake in ITV plc for £940 million, a move that attracted anger from NTL shareholder Richard Branson and an investigation from media and telecoms regulator Ofcom. On 6 December 2006, NTL announced that it had complained to the Office of Fair Trading about BSkyB&#x27;s move. NTL stated that it had withdrawn its attempt to buy ITV plc, citing that it did not believe that there was any possibility to make a deal on favourable terms. On 17 July 2014, BSkyB&#x27;s 6.4% stake in ITV was sold to Liberty Global, valued at £481 million.

<doc id="77773" wikidata="Q70626" url="?curid=77773" title="Chicago Loop">
<text>The Loop is Chicago&#x27;s central business district and one of the city&#x27;s 77 municipally recognized community areas. Located at the center of downtown Chicago on the shores of Lake Michigan, it is the second-largest business district in North America after Midtown Manhattan. The headquarters and regional offices of several global and national businesses, retail establishments, restaurants, hotels, and theaters–as well as many of Chicago&#x27;s most famous attractions–are located in the Loop. The neighborhood also hosts Chicago&#x27;s City Hall, the seat of Cook County, offices of other levels of government, and several foreign consulates. The intersection of State Street and Madison Street in the Loop is the origin point for the address system on Chicago&#x27;s street grid.

The Loop&#x27;s definition and perceived boundaries have developed over time. Since the 1920s, the area bounded by the Chicago River to the west and north, Lake Michigan to the east, and Roosevelt Road (12th Street) to the south is called the Loop. It took its name from a somewhat smaller area, which meant the 35 city blocks bounded on the north by Lake Street, on the west by Wells Street, on the south by Van Buren Street, and on the east by Wabash Avenue—the Union Loop formed by the &#x27;L&#x27; in the late 1800s. Similarly, &quot;South&quot; and &quot;West Loop&quot; historically referred to areas within the Loop proper, but in the 21st century began to refer to the entire Near South and much of the Near West Sides of the city, respectively.

In 1803, the United States Army built Fort Dearborn in what is now the Loop; although earlier settlement was present, this was first settlement in the area sponsored by the United States&#x27; federal government. When Chicago and Cook County were incorporated in the 1830s, the area was selected as the site of their respective seats. Originally mixed-use, the neighborhood became increasingly commercial in the 1870s. This process accelerated in the aftermath of the 1871 Great Chicago Fire, which destroyed most of the neighborhood&#x27;s buildings. Some of the world&#x27;s earliest skyscrapers were constructed in the Loop, giving rise to the Chicago School of architecture. By the late 19th century, cable car turnarounds and the Union Loop encircled the area, giving the neighborhood its name. Near the lake, Grant Park &quot;Chicago&#x27;s front yard&quot; is Chicago&#x27;s oldest park but was significantly expanded in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and houses a number of features and museums. Starting in the 1920s, road improvements for highways were constructed to and into the Loop, perhaps most famously U.S. Route 66, which opened in 1926.

While dominated by offices and public buildings, its residential population boomed during the latter 20th century and first decades of the 21st, partly due to the development of former rail yards (at one time, the area had six major interurban railroad terminals and land was also needed for extensive rail cargo storage and transfer), industrial building conversions, as well as additional highrise residences. Since 1950, the Loop&#x27;s resident population has increased in percentage terms, the most out of all of Chicago&#x27;s community areas.

==History==

===Etymology===
The origin of the name &quot;the Loop&quot; is disputed. Some sources claim it first referred to two cable car lines that used a circuit–constructed in 1882 and bounded by Van Buren Street, Wabash Avenue, Wells Street, and Lake Street–to enter and depart the downtown area. Other research, however, has concluded that &quot;the Loop&quot; was not used as a proper noun until after the 1895–97 construction of the Union Loop used by &#x27;L&#x27; trains, which shared the same route.

===19th century===
In what is now the Loop, on the south bank of the Chicago River near today&#x27;s Michigan Avenue Bridge, the United States Army erected Fort Dearborn in 1803, the first settlement in the area sponsored by the United States. When Chicago was initially platted in 1830 by the surveyor James Thompson, it included what is now the Loop north of Madison Street and west of State Street. The Sauganash Hotel, the first hotel in Chicago, was built in 1831 near Wolf Point at what is now the northwestern corner of the Loop. When Cook County was incorporated in 1831, the first meeting of its government was held at Fort Dearborn with two representatives from Chicago and one from Naperville. The entirety of what is now the Loop was part of the Town of Chicago when it was initially incorporated in 1833, except for the Fort Dearborn reservation that became part of the city in 1839 and land reclaimed from Lake Michigan.

The area was bustling by the end of the 1830s. Lake Street started to be a center for retail at that time, until it was eclipsed by State Street in the 1850s.

===20th century===

By 1948 an estimated one million people came to and went from the Loop each day. Afterwards, suburbanization caused a decrease in the area&#x27;s importance. Starting in the 1960s, however, the presence of an upscale shopping district caused the area&#x27;s fortunes to increase.

===21st century===
The Loop&#x27;s population has boomed in recent years, having a 158 percent population increase between 2000 and 2020. Between 2010 and 2014, the number of jobs in The Loop increased by nearly 63,000 jobs, or an increase of over 13%.

==Economy and employment==
The Loop, along with the rest of downtown Chicago, is the second largest commercial business district in the United States after New York City&#x27;s Midtown Manhattan. Its financial district near LaSalle Street is home to United Airlines, Hyatt Hotels &amp; Resorts, and CME Group&#x27;s Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Aon Corporation maintains an office in the Aon Center. Chase Tower houses the headquarters of Exelon. United Airlines has its headquarters in Willis Tower, having moved its headquarters to Chicago from suburban Elk Grove Township in early 2007. Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association has its headquarters in the Michigan Plaza complex. Sidley Austin has an office in the Loop.

The Chicago Loop Alliance is located at 55 West Monroe, the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce is located in an office in the Aon Center, the French-American Chamber of Commerce in Chicago has an office in 35 East Wacker, the Netherlands Chamber of Commerce in the United States is located in an office at 303 East Wacker Drive, and the US Mexico Chamber of Commerce Mid-America Chapter is located in an office in One Prudential Plaza.

McDonald&#x27;s was headquartered in the Loop until 1971, when it moved to suburban Oak Brook. When Bank One Corporation existed, its headquarters were in the Bank One Plaza, which is now Chase Tower. When Amoco existed, its headquarters were in the Amoco Building, which is now the Aon Center.

In 2019, about 40 percent of Loop residents were also employed in the Loop. 26.8 percent worked outside of Chicago. Respectively 11.5, 8.0, and 2.8 percent worked in the Near North Side, the Near West Side, and Hyde Park. Conversely, 45.5 percent of the people employed in the Loop lived outside of Chicago. Lake View housed 4 percent of Loop employees, the highest percentage of any of Chicago&#x27;s community areas. The Near North Side, West Town, and Lincoln Park respectively housed 3.8, 2.6, and 2.5 percent of those working in the Loop.

The professional sector is the largest source of employment of both Loop residents and Loop employees, at respectively 21.4 and 23.3 percent. Finance was the second most common employment for both groups, at respectively 13.5 and 17.7 percent. Health Care was the third largest sector for residents at 10.2 percent while Education was the third largest sector for Loop employees at 13 percent. Education was the fourth largest employer of residents at 9.4 percent while Public Administration was the fourth largest for Loop employees at 13 percent. Administration was the fifth largest sector for both groups, at respectively 6.9 and 7.3 percent.

==Architecture==
The area has long been a hub for architecture. The vast majority of the area was destroyed by the Great Chicago Fire in 1871 but rebuilt quickly. In 1885 the Home Insurance Building, generally considered the world&#x27;s first skyscraper, was constructed, followed by the development of the Chicago school best exemplified by such buildings as the Rookery Building in 1888, the Monadnock Building in 1891, and the Sullivan Center in 1899.

Loop architecture has been dominated by skyscrapers and high-rises since early in its history. Notable buildings include the Home Insurance Building, considered the world&#x27;s first skyscraper (demolished in 1931); the Chicago Board of Trade Building, a National Historic Landmark; and Willis Tower, the world&#x27;s tallest building for nearly 25 years. Some of the historic buildings in this district were instrumental in the development of towers.

This area abounds in shopping opportunities, including the Loop Retail Historic District, although it competes with the more upscale Magnificent Mile area to the north. It includes Chicago&#x27;s former Marshall Field&#x27;s department store location in the Marshall Field and Company Building; the original Sullivan Center Carson Pirie Scott store location (closed February 21, 2007). Chicago&#x27;s Downtown Theatre District is also found within this area, along with numerous restaurants and hotels.

Chicago has a famous skyline which features many of the tallest buildings in the world as well as the Chicago Landmark Historic Michigan Boulevard District. Chicago&#x27;s skyline is spaced out throughout the downtown area. The Willis Tower, formerly known as the Sears Tower, the third tallest building in the Western Hemisphere (and still second-tallest by roof height), stands in the western Loop in the heart of the city&#x27;s financial district, along with other buildings, such as 311 South Wacker Drive and the AT&amp;T Corporate Center.

Chicago&#x27;s fourth tallest building, the Aon Center, is located just south of Illinois Center. The complex is at the east end of the Loop, east of Michigan Avenue. Two Prudential Plaza is also located here, just to the west of the Aon Center.

The Loop contains a wealth of outdoor sculpture, including works by Pablo Picasso, Joan Miró, Henry Moore, Marc Chagall, Magdalena Abakanowicz, Alexander Calder, and Jean Dubuffet. Chicago&#x27;s cultural heavyweights, such as the Art Institute of Chicago, the Goodman Theatre, the Chicago Theatre, the Lyric Opera at the Civic Opera House building, and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, are also in this area, as is the historic Palmer House Hilton hotel, found on East Monroe Street.

Chicago&#x27;s waterfront, which is almost exclusively recreational beach and park areas from north to south, features Grant Park in the downtown area. Grant Park is the home of Buckingham Fountain, the Petrillo Music Shell, the Grant Park Symphony (where free concerts can be enjoyed throughout the summer), and Chicago&#x27;s annual two-week food festival, the Taste of Chicago, where more than 3 million people try foods from over 70 vendors. The area also hosts the annual music festival Lollapalooza which features popular alternative rock, heavy metal, EDM, hip hop, and punk rock, artists. Millennium Park, which is a section of Grant Park, opened in the summer of 2004 and features Frank Gehry&#x27;s Jay Pritzker Pavilion, Jaume Plensa&#x27;s Crown Fountain, and Anish Kapoor&#x27;s Cloud Gate sculpture along Lake Michigan.

The Chicago River and its accompanying Chicago Riverwalk, which delineates the area, also provides entertainment and recreational opportunities, including the annual dyeing of the river green in honor of St. Patrick&#x27;s Day. Trips down the Chicago River, including architectural tours, by commercial boat operators, are great favorites with both locals and tourists alike.

==Government==
The Loop is the seat of Chicago&#x27;s city government. It is also the government seat of Cook County and houses an office for the governor of Illinois. The city and county governments are situated in the same century-old building. Across the street, the Richard J. Daley Center accommodates a sculpture by Pablo Picasso and the state law courts. Given its proximity to government offices, the center&#x27;s plaza serves as a kind of town square for celebrations, protests, and other events.

The Loop is in South Chicago Township within Cook County. Townships in Chicago were abolished for governmental purposes in 1902 but are still used for property assessment.

The nearby James R. Thompson Center is the city headquarters for state government, with an office for the Governor. Many state agencies have offices here, including the Illinois State Board of Education.

A few blocks away is the Everett McKinley Dirksen United States Courthouse housing federal law courts and other federal government offices. This is the seat of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. The Kluczynski Federal Building is across the street.

==Politics==
===Local===
The Loop is currently a part of the 4th, 25th, 34th and 42nd wards of the Chicago City Council, which are represented by aldermen Sophia King, Byron Sigcho-Lopez, Bill Conway and Brendan Reilly.

From the city&#x27;s incorporation and division into wards in 1837 to 1992, the Loop as currently defined was at least partially contained within the 1st ward. From 1891 to 1992 it was entirely within the 1st ward and was coterminous with it between 1891 and 1901. It was while part of the 1st ward that it was represented by the Gray Wolves. The area has not had a Republican alderman since Francis P. Gleason served alongside Coughlin from 1895 to 1897. (Prior to 1923, each ward elected two aldermen in staggered two-year terms).

In the Cook County Board of Commissioners the eastern half of the area is part of the 3rd district, represented by Democrat Jerry Butler, while the western half is part of the 2nd district, represented by Democrat Dennis Deer.

===State===
In the Illinois House of Representatives the community area is roughly evenly split lengthwise between, from east to west, Districts 26, 5, and 6, represented respectively by Democrats Kambium Buckner, Lamont Robinson, and Sonya Harper, with a minuscule portion in District 9 represented by Democrat Lakesia Collins.

In the Illinois Senate most of the community area is in District 3, represented by Democrat Mattie Hunter, while a large part in the east is part of District 13, represented by Democrat Robert Peters, and a very small part in the west is part of District 5, represented by Democrat Patricia Van Pelt.

===Federal===
The Loop community area has supported the Democratic Party in the past two presidential elections by large margins. In the 2016 presidential election, the Loop cast 11,141 votes for Hillary Clinton and cast 2,148 votes for Donald Trump (79.43% to 15.31%). In the 2012 presidential election, the Loop cast 8,134 votes for Barack Obama and cast 2,850 votes for Mitt Romney (72.26% to 25.32%).

In the U.S. House of Representatives, the area is wholly within Illinois&#x27;s 7th congressional district, which is the most Democratically leaning district in Illinois according to the Cook Partisan Voting Index with a score of D+38 and represented by Democrat Danny K. Davis.

==Transportation==

The Loop area derives its name from transportation networks present in it.

===Public transportation===
Passenger lines reached seven Loop-area stations by the 1890s, with transfers from one to the other being a major business for taxi drivers prior to the advent of Amtrak in the 1970s and the majority of trains being concentrated at Chicago Union Station across the river in the Near West Side. The construction of a streetcar loop in 1882 and the elevated railway loop in the 1890s gave the area its name and cemented its dominance in the city.

In Metra the Millennium Station, which serves as the Chicago terminal of the Metra Electric District line that goes to University Park, and LaSalle Street Station, which serves as the Chicago terminal of the Rock Island District line bound for Joliet, are in the Loop. In addition to the terminals, the Van Buren Street station and Museum Campus/11th Street station on the Electric District line are also in the Loop. All stations in the Loop are in Zone A for fare collection purposes. The interurban South Shore Line, which goes to South Bend, Indiana, has its Chicago terminal at Millennium Station.

All lines of the Chicago &quot;L&quot; except the Yellow Line serve the Loop area for at least some hours. The State Street Subway and Dearborn Street Subway, respectively parts of the Red Line and Blue Line, are present in the Loop area and offer 24/7 service; the Red and Blue Lines are the only rapid transit lines in the United States west of the Appalachian Mountains to offer such service. Bus Rapid Transit has been implemented in the Loop.

===Private transportation and roads===

Chicago&#x27;s address system has been standardized as beginning at the intersection of State and Madison Streets since September 1, 1909. Prior to that time, Chicago&#x27;s street system was a hodgepodge of various systems which had resulted from the different municipalities that Chicago annexed in the late 19th century. The implementation of the new street system was delayed by two years in the Loop to allow businesses more time to acclimate to their new addresses.

Several streets in the Loop have multiple levels, some as many as three. The most prominent of these is Wacker Drive, which faces the Chicago River throughout the area. Illinois Center neighborhood has three-level streets.

The eastern terminus of U.S. Route 66 (US 66), an iconic highway in the United States first charted in 1926, was located at Jackson Boulevard and Michigan Avenue. When Illinois and Missouri agreed that the local signage for US 66 should be replaced with that of Interstate 55 (I-55) as the highway was predominately north–south in those states, most signs of the former highway in Chicago were removed without incident but the final sign on the corner of Jackson and Michigan was removed with great fanfare on January 13, 1977, and replaced with a sign reading &quot;END OF ROUTE 66&quot;.

The first anti-parking ordinance of streets in the Loop was passed on May 1, 1918, in order to help streetcars, and had been advocated by Chicago Surface Lines. This law banned the parking of any vehicle between 7 and 10 a.m. and 4 and 7 p.m. on a street used by streetcars; approximately 1,000 violators of this law were arrested in the first month of the ordinance&#x27;s enforcement. The La Salle Hotel&#x27;s parking garage was the first high-rise parking garage in the Loop, constructed in 1917 at the corner of Washington and LaSalle Streets and remaining in service until its demolition in 2005. In the 1920s old buildings were purchased in the area and converted to parking structures. More high-rise garages and parking lots were constructed in the 1930s, which also saw the advent of double-deck parking. The first parking meters were installed in 1947 and private garages were regulated in 1957; they were banned outright in the Loop in the 1970s in response to federal air-quality standards. The first underground garages were built by the city in the early 1950s.

All residences and places of employment within the Loop are in highly walkable areas; the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning defines such areas based on population density, the length of city blocks, tree canopy cover, fatalities or grievous injuries incurred by pedestrians and bicyclists in the area, the density of intersections, and amenities located near the area. 33.3 percent of Loop residents walk or bike to work compared to 7.3 percent citywide. An additional 19.4 percent of Loop residents use transit for a daily commute, while 23.4 percent of residents citywide do. Just 22.2 percent of Loop residents drive to work alone or in a carpool, compared to 54.9 percent of all Chicago residents and 72.5 percent in the greater Chicago region. By household, 47.2 percent of Loop residents do not have access to a personal vehicle at all, compared to 26.4 percent citywide and 12.6 percent regionally.

==Geography and neighborhoods==
The Loop is Community Area 32. In addition to the financial (West Loop–LaSalle Street Historic District), theatre, and jewelry (Jewelers Row District) districts, there are neighborhoods that are also part of the Loop community area.

===New Eastside===
According to the 2010 census, 29,283 people live in the neighborhoods in or near the Loop. The median sale price for residential real estate was $710,000 in 2005 according to Forbes. In addition to the government, financial, theatre and shopping districts, there are neighborhoods that are also part of the Loop community area. For much of its history this Section was used for Illinois Central rail yards, including the IC&#x27;s Great Central Station, with commercial buildings along Michigan Avenue. The New Eastside is a mixed-use district bordered by Michigan Avenue to the west, the Chicago River to the north, Randolph Street to the south, and Lake Shore Drive to the east. It encompasses the entire Illinois Center and Lakeshore East is the latest lead-developer of the 1969 Planned Development #70, as well as separate developments like Aon Center, Prudential Plaza, Park Millennium Condominium Building, Hyatt Regency Chicago, and the Fairmont Chicago, Millennium Park. The area has a triple-level street system and is bisected by Columbus Drive. Most of this district has been developed on land that was originally water and once used by the Illinois Central Railroad rail yards. The early buildings in this district such as the Aon Center and One Prudential Plaza used airspace rights in order to build above the railyards. The New Eastside Association of Residents (NEAR) has been the recognized community representative (Illinois non-profit corporation) since 1991 and is a 501(c)(3) IRS tax-exempt organization.

The triple-level street system allows for trucks to mainly travel and make deliveries on the lower levels, keeping traffic to a minimum on the upper levels. Through north–south traffic uses Middle Columbus and the bridge over the Chicago River. East–west through traffic uses either Middle Randolph or Upper and Middle Wacker between Michigan Avenue and Lake Shore Drive.

===Printer&#x27;s Row===
Printer&#x27;s Row, also known as Printing House Row, is a neighborhood located in the southern portion of the Loop community area of Chicago. It is centered on Dearborn Street from Ida B. Wells Drive on the north to Polk Street on the south, and includes buildings along Plymouth Court on the east and Federal Street to the west. Most of the buildings in this area were built between 1886 and 1915 for house printing, publishing, and related businesses. Today, the buildings have mainly been converted into residential lofts. Part of Printer&#x27;s Row is an official landmark district, called the Printing House Row District. The annual Printers Row Lit Fest is held in early June along Dearborn Street.

===South Loop===
Most of the area south of Ida B. Wells Drive between Lake Michigan and the Chicago River, excepting Chinatown, is referred to as the South Loop. Perceptions of the southern boundary of the neighborhood have changed as development spread south, and the name is now used as far south as 26th Street.

The neighborhood includes former railyards that have been redeveloped as new-town-in-town such as Dearborn Park and Central Station. Former warehouses and factory lofts have been converted to residential buildings, while new townhouses and highrises have been developed on vacant or underused land. Dearborn Station at the south end of Printers Row, is the oldest train station still standing in Chicago; it has been converted to retail and office space. A major landowner in the South Loop is Columbia College Chicago, a private school that owns 17 buildings.

South Loop is zoned to the following Chicago Schools: South Loop School and Phillips Academy High School. Jones College Prep High School, which is a selective enrollment prep school drawing students from the entire city, is also located in the South Loop.

The South Loop was historically home to vice districts, including the brothels, bars, burlesque theaters, and arcades. Inexpensive residential hotels on Van Buren and State Street made it one of the city&#x27;s Skid Rows until the 1970s. One of the largest homeless shelters in the city, the Pacific Garden Mission, was located at State and Balbo from 1923 to 2007, when it moved to 1458 S. Canal St.

===Historic Michigan Boulevard District===
The Loop also contains the Chicago Landmark Historic Michigan Boulevard District, which is the section of Michigan Avenue opposite Grant Park and Millennium Park.

Historical images and current architecture of the Chicago Loop can be found in Explore Chicago Collections, a digital repository made available by Chicago Collections archives, libraries and other cultural institutions in the city.

<text>In music, a loop is a repeating section of sound material. Short sections can be repeated to create ostinato patterns. Longer sections can also be repeated: for example, a player might loop what they play on an entire verse of a song in order to then play along with it, accompanying themselves.

Loops can be created using a wide range of music technologies including turntables, digital samplers, looper pedals, synthesizers, sequencers, drum machines, tape machines, and delay units, and they can be programmed using computer music software. The feature to loop a section of an audio track or video footage is also referred to by electronics vendors as &quot;A–B repeat&quot;.

Royalty-free loops can be purchased and downloaded for music creation from companies like The Loop Loft, Native Instruments, Splice and Output.

Loops are supplied in either MIDI or Audio file formats such as WAV, REX2, AIFF and MP3. Musicians &quot;play&quot; loops by triggering the start of the musical sequence by using a MIDI controller such as an Ableton Push or a Native Instruments MASCHINE.

==Definitions==
*&quot;Loops are short sections of tracks (probably between one and four bars in length), which you believe might work being repeated.&quot; A loop is not &quot;&quot;any&quot; sample, but ... specifically a small section of sound that&#x27;s repeated continuously.&quot; Contrast with a one-shot sample.
*&quot;A loop is a sample of a performance that has been edited to repeat seamlessly when the audio file is played end to end.&quot;
*&quot;A drum loop is technically a short recording of multiple drum materials which has been edited to loop seamlessly ( to loop smoothly and continuously), a drum loop repeats until an exact duration is satisfied, for example, to break a single loop to another, you might want to use a drum fill which could also be a seamless loop.&quot;

==Origins==
While repetition is used in the music of all cultures, the first musicians to use loops in the sense meant by this article were musique concrete and electroacoustic music pioneers of the 1940s, such as Pierre Schaeffer, Halim El-Dabh, Pierre Henry, Edgard Varèse and Karlheinz Stockhausen. These composers used tape loops on reel-to-reel machines, manipulating pre-recorded sounds to make new works. In turn, El-Dabh&#x27;s music influenced Frank Zappa&#x27;s use of tape loops in the mid-1960s.

Terry Riley is a seminal composer and performer of the loop- and ostinato-based music who began using tape loops in 1960. For his 1963 piece &quot;Music for The Gift&quot; he devised a hardware looper that he named the Time Lag Accumulator, consisting of two tape recorders linked together, which he used to loop and manipulate trumpet player Chet Baker and his band. His 1964 composition &quot;In C&quot;, an early example of what would later be called minimalism, consists of 53 repeated melodic phrases (loops) performed live by an ensemble. &quot;Poppy Nogood and the Phantom Band&quot;, the B-side of his influential 1969 album &quot;A Rainbow in Curved Air&quot; uses tape loops of his electric organ and soprano saxophone to create electronic music that contains surprises as well as hypnotic repetition. 

Another effective use of tape loops was Jamaican dub music in the 1960s. Dub producer King Tubby used tape loops in his productions while improvising with homemade delay units. Another dub producer, Sylvan Morris, developed a slapback echo effect by using both mechanical and handmade tape loops. These techniques were later adopted by hip hop musicians in the 1970s. Grandmaster Flash&#x27;s turntablism is an early example in hip hop.

The first commercial drum loop was created for the song “Stayin’ Alive” for the movie Saturday Night Fever by Albhy Galuten and Karl Richardson. It was created by recording two measures of drums from the song “Night Fever” and recording them onto a two-track analog tape which was then fed between the capstan and the pinch roller. Because the loop was about 30 feet long, it was fed out to a 7” plastic reel for ballast which was hung over the arm of a microphone stand before the loop of tape returned to the take-up reel. This same loop was later used by the Bee Gees for the song “More than a Woman” also from the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack. That same loop was also use – though slowed down quite a bit, for the Streisand recording of “Woman in Love” produced by Albhy Galuten, Karl Richardson and Barry Gibb. When Jeff Porcaro of the band TOTO came to work with Galuten and Gibb on a Bee Gees record, he was shown the technique of creating drum loops with analog tape. Porcaro subsequently went back to California where he used the method he had learned to create the drum loop that was used by Toto as the foundation of the song Africa.

The use of pre-recorded, digitally-sampled loops in popular music dates back to Japanese electronic music band Yellow Magic Orchestra, who released one of the first albums to feature mostly samples and loops, 1981&#x27;s &quot;Technodelic&quot;. Their approach to sampling was a precursor to the contemporary approach of constructing music by cutting fragments of sounds and looping them using computer technology. The album was produced using Toshiba-EMI&#x27;s LMD-649 digital PCM sampler, which engineer Kenji Murata custom-built for YMO.

==Modern looping==

Today, many musicians use digital hardware and software devices to create and modify loops, often in conjunction with various electronic musical effects. A loop can be created by a looper pedal, a device that records the signal from a guitar or other audio source and then plays the recorded passage over and over again. 

In the early 1990s, dedicated digital devices were invented specifically for use in live looping, i.e. loops that are recorded in front of a live audience. 

Many hardware loopers exist, some in rack unit form, but primarily as effect pedals. The discontinued Lexicon JamMan, Gibson Echoplex Digital Pro, Electrix Repeater, and Looperlative LP1 are 19&quot; rack units. The Boomerang &quot;Rang III&quot; Phrase Sampler, DigiTech JamMan, Boss RC-300 and the Electro-Harmonix 2880 are examples of popular pedals. As of December 2015, the following pedals are currently in production: TC Ditto, TC Ditto X2, TC Ditto Mic, TC Ditto Stereo, Boss RC-1, Boss RC-3, Boss RC-30, Boss RC-300 and Boss RC-505.

The musical loop is one of the most important features of video game music. It is also the guiding principle behind devices like the several Chinese Buddhist music boxes that loop chanting of mantras, which in turn were the inspiration of the Buddha machine, an ambient-music generating device. The Jan Linton album &quot;Buddha Machine Music&quot; used these loops along with others created by manually scrolling through C.D.s on a CDJ player.

<text>All fours is a traditional English card game, once popular in pubs and taverns as well as among the gentry, that flourished as a gambling game until the end of the 19th century. It is a trick-taking card game that was originally designed for two players, but developed variants for more players. According to Charles Cotton, the game originated in Kent, but spread to the whole of England and eventually abroad. 
It is the eponymous and earliest recorded game of a family that flourished most in 19th century North America and whose progeny include pitch, pedro and cinch, games that even competed with poker and euchre. Nowadays the original game is especially popular in Trinidad and Tobago, but regional variants have also survived in England. The game&#x27;s &quot;great mark of distinction&quot; is that it gave the name &#x27;jack&#x27; to the card previously known as the knave.

The game has a number of unusual features. In trick play, players are allowed to trump instead of following suit even if they could. The title refers to the possibility of winning all four game points for &quot;high, low, jack&quot; and &quot;game&quot; for holding (later winning) the highest and lowest trump in play and the jack of trumps and for winning the greatest number of card points.

==History==
All fours is among the oldest extant card games in England. Its first known description was in Charles Cotton&#x27;s &quot;Compleat Gamester&quot; of 1674, where the game was reported as popular in Kent. It is probably of Dutch ancestry, and is the game that gave the name &quot;jack&quot; to the card that was originally known only as the knave.

By no later than the 1800s, the game was taken to America and became popular among African Americans on slave plantations. Also called seven up, it gave rise to other variants such as Pitch and Auction Pitch, which probably developed in the New England states, Pedro, and California jack, also known as ligh-low-jack. Modern descendants include don and phat, developed in Britain and Ireland. The game is still played in north-west England and Wales, and it has become the national game of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago.

==Classic all fours (earliest rules)==
The earliest known rules for all fours appear in the 1674 edition of &quot;The Compleat Gamester&quot; by Charles Cotton. Cotton tells us that &quot;All-Fours is a Game very much play&#x27;d in Kent, and very well it may since from thence it drew its first original; and although the game may be lookt upon as trivial and inconsiderable, yet I have known Kentish Gentlemen and others of very considerable note, who have play&#x27;d great sums of money at it...&quot; 
His rules, which are not complete, are as follows.

The game was called all fours from its four point-earning feats: &quot;highest, lowest, jack&quot; and &quot;game&quot;. It was a game for two players. The players &#x27;lifted&#x27; (i.e. cut) for the deal and the player with the highest put-card won. This presumably meant the highest using the ranking in put i.e. 3-2-A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4. However, in the rest of the game the cards rank in their natural order (aces high).

The dealer dealt three cards each, beginning with elder hand, and then three more each so that both players had six cards, before turning the next for trump. If the turn-up was a jack, the dealer scored 1 point. If elder did not like his hand, he could &#x27;beg&#x27;; if the dealer accepted, elder scored 1 point and threw his cards in; if the dealer refused, he dealt three more cards each and turned another for trump. If the latter was of the same suit, the exercise was repeated.

The scoring card values for &quot;game&quot; are ace 4, king 3, queen 2, jack 1, and ten 10. Play is not described in detail, except that it seems players had to follow suit, but could renege on doing so if they had a trump. According to McLeod, elder led to the first trick and players had to follow suit or trump, but could not discard unless they could not follow. The higher trump won or, if none were played, the higher card of the led suit. The trick winner led to the next.

Players scored a point for &quot;highest&quot;: holding the highest trump; &quot;lowest&quot;: holding the lowest trump at the start; &quot;jack&quot;: winning the trick containing the trump jack; and &quot;game&quot;: winning the most card points in tricks based on the values described above. Game was usually 11, although Cotton says that players may play to a total of anything from 7 to 15 points.

Cotton describes a variation called running all-fours played to a score of 31 points and in which the dealer scored the value of the trump turn-up e.g. 3 points for turning a king.

==Classic all fours (modern rules)==

The following rules for classic all fours are based on Arnold (2010), supplemented where stated by Parlett (2008):

The aim is to be the first player to 7, points being awarded for &quot;gift, high, low, jack&quot; and &quot;game&quot;. A standard, 52-card, English pattern pack is used with cards ranking in their natural order (aces high). The card values are as shown in the table (&quot;right&quot;).

Players draw cards for the role of first dealer; the player drawing the higher card wins. Thereafter the deal alternates. The dealer shuffles and elder hand cuts. The dealer deals six cards each in two packets of three, beginning with elder hand, and turns the next card for trump. If it is a jack, he scores 1 point for &quot;jack&quot;. After examining their hands, elder may accept the trump suit by saying &quot;I stand&quot; or reject it by saying &quot;I beg&quot;. If the dealer agrees, he says &quot;take one&quot; and concedes 1 point for &quot;Gift&quot; to elder hand and play begins. Alternative the dealer may say &quot;I refuse the gift&quot; or &quot;I run the cards&quot;, in which case the turn-up is turned down and the cards are &#x27;run&#x27;.

If the first turn-up is rejected, it is discarded, face down, and each player receives 3 more cards, face down, and the next is turned for trump. If its suit is different from the first turn-up it is automatically entrumped. If it is the same suit again, the new turn-up and extra downcards are discard without being viewed and the cards are run again. This continues until a trump suit is established. If the new trump upcard is a jack, the dealer scores 1 for &quot;jack&quot;. If the cards run out, they are throw in and redealt. 

If the cards were run, once trumps are decided, each player picks up the three additional cards and discards three in their place, reducing his hand to six cards. Elder then leads to the first trick. As before, players may either follow suit or trump, but may only renege if they cannot follow. The trick is taken by the higher trump or by the higher card of the led suit if no trumps are played. The trick winner leads to the next trick.

In addition to any points scored during the deal for &quot;gift&quot; or turning the &quot;jack&quot;, players score one point for each of the following: &quot;high&quot;: winning the highest trump in play; &quot;low&quot;: winning the lowest trump in play; &quot;jack&quot;: winning the trump jack if in play; and &quot;game&quot; for scoring the most card points in tricks. In &quot;game&quot;, if the two players tie, elder hand wins. Points made during the deal are scored immediately and may result in the player &#x27;counting out&#x27; (winning with 7 points) without the need for any further play. Otherwise, players score at the end of the deal in the order: &quot;high, low, jack&quot; and &quot;game&quot;. 

==Three or more players==

Although all fours is basically a two-player game, it is also good for three or four and can be played by even more. Four can play individually or in two fixed partnerships, sitting crosswise. The following rules have been formulated for any number of players.

After dealing the dealer turns the next card on the stock face up to determine the trump suit. Instead of immediately leading to the first trick, eldest hand has the option of &quot;begging&quot;, to which the dealer responds either by granting each opposing party 1 point, or by &quot;running the cards&quot;. To run the cards, the dealer deals three more cards to each player and turns up a new card for trump. Should the new card be of the same suit as the previous one, the dealer again deals three cards to each player and turns up a new card. This is repeated as often as necessary. If the cards were run, the respective number of tricks is played. If the dealer turns up a jack that determines trumps, the dealer is immediately awarded 1 point for &quot;jack&quot;. In a game with two parties, a maximum of 6 points can accrue in one deal if the dealer turns up a jack and runs the cards.

==Variants==
There was little variation between Charles Cotton&#x27;s 1674 rules and the rules in early 20th century English and American rule books. Today, in addition to the classical game that is still widely published, there are four main variants of all fours. In England, the game is thriving in the counties of Lancashire and West Yorkshire where all fours leagues exist, however the rules in the two counties are slightly different. The game is also popular in the Caribbean, especially in Trinidad where it has become their national game. In America, it has largely been superseded by other members of the family, especially Pitch, but all fours also exists in a form known as Seven Up, the American name for all fours played to a target score of 7 points. Detailed rules for the following variants are given at pagat.com.

===Caribbean all fours===
All fours is the national card game of Trinidad and Tobago, where it is typically played as a four-player partnership game with the following variations to the standard rules.

Deal and play are anticlockwise and game is 14 points. Instead of scoring 1 for turning the jack, the dealer scores 1 point for turning up the Ace, 2 points for the Six (in Trinidad) or Two (in Tobago) and 3 points for the jack. If running the cards as a result of the opposing team begging, the dealer scores each time such a card is turned up, even if it does not make trumps. If the jack was captured in a trick won by the party that did not originally hold it, the party scores 3 points for &quot;Hang jack&quot; instead of 1 point for jack. Players may lead any card, but the rules for following are subtly different. If a trump is led, players must play a trump if possible; otherwise may discard. If a card of a side suit is led, players must either follow suit or trump. If they cannot follow, they need not trump however.

===Yorkshire all fours===
In Yorkshire, all fours is still a popular pub and league game for four players in two teams of two. The gist of the rules is as follows:

A standard pack is used; aces are high. Deal and player are clockwise. Players receive cards to decide first dealer; the player with the first jack becomes the pitcher (as eldest hand) and the player to his right, the dealer. Players receive six cards in three rounds of variable number as the dealer chooses.

There is no begging and trumps are revealed by the pitcher leading or &#x27;pitching&#x27; any card, its suit becoming trumps for the deal. To the lead of a trump, players must play a trump if able; to the lead of a plain suit card, players must either follow suit or trump unless they cannot follow suit, in which case they may discard. A player with no trumps or counting cards left and who is losing the current trick, may throw in his hand, face up, leaving his partner to continue alone.

At the end of the deal, teams score for &quot;High&quot;, &quot;Low&quot;, &quot;jack&quot; and &quot;Game&quot; as usual. &quot;Low&quot; goes to the team dealt the lowest trump. In the event of a tie for &quot;Game&quot;, the point is not scored. Points are pegged on a wooden board and game is 11 points.

===Lancashire all fours===
The Lancashire variant differs from its Yorkshire counterpart as follows:

Cards are cut for first pitch. The first player cuts and an opponent must guess the colour of the suit; if right, his team chooses the first pitcher; if wrong, the cutting team choose the pitcher. &quot;Low&quot; goes to the team that captures the lowest trump. There are a number of other procedural points that may differ from the Yorkshire variant, but the detail is not known.

==Related games==
All fours has spawned a whole family of games, several of which have been highly successful, especially in America, Ireland and Wales. One variant, pidro, has even been found in Finland, although games of the all fours genre have otherwise hardly penetrated Europe.

===Pitch===

Pitch is a North American descendant of all fours. Two or more players play individually or in equal-sized teams, seated alternatingly. Default play rotation is clockwise in most areas. Players cut for first deal. Cards rank as in Whist and have certain numerical card point values as shown in the table. In each deal up to 4 scoring points are distributed among the parties. The game is won by the party that first reaches the previously specified target score over several deals.

The dealer shuffles and the player sitting before him in rotation, cuts. The dealer hands out 6 cards to each player in batches of 3. Trump is determined by the suit of the first card played in trick-play. Eldest hand leads to the first trick, and the winner of each trick leads to the next. Standard trick-play rules are in effect with the exception that a player who can follow suit to a plain suit lead is nevertheless allowed to play a trump.

At the end of the round scoring points are awarded as described in the table. The jack point is not awarded if no player held the jack of trumps. The Game point is only awarded if one party has won more card points in tricks than any other. The scoring points accrue strictly in the order given in the table, preventing ties in case more than one team reaches the target score at the end of the deal.

The pub game played nowadays in northern England under the name &quot;all nours&quot; is a four-player partnership version of pitch, played with 4 hands of cards. The lead card in each hand becomes trumps and all game points are counted after each hand has been played. If the game is tied, a further 2 hands, a &#x27;pitch apiece&#x27; are played until a winner is decided. The point for &quot;low&quot; is awarded to the eventual owner.

Choosing the trump suit by leading to the first trick is known as &quot;pitching&quot;. That trump is determined by pitching rather than by turning up a card from the stock is the key difference between Pitch and classic all fours/seven up.

===Auction pitch===

Around the middle of the 19th century among American players an innovation spread, allowing the eldest hand to &quot;sell the trump&quot;, i.e. auction the privilege to pitch. This early form of auction pitch is now known as &quot;commercial pitch&quot;.

In commercial pitch the players in turn get a chance to bid 1–4 points for the privilege of pitching, or pass. Each bid must be higher than the previous one. Eldest hand immediately scores the amount of the bid. A highest bidder who does not win at least as many points as bid is &quot;set back&quot; the amount of the bid. Eldest hand may refuse to sell the right to pitch to the highest bidder, in which case eldest hand must win at least as many points or is set back.

In modern auction pitch the right to pitch is bought from the bank rather than from eldest hand. Starting with eldest hand each player bids for the privilege of pitching or passes exactly once. The highest bidder determines trumps by leading to the first trick. After the last trick all parties score their points as in all fours. However, if the pitcher&#x27;s party has not won as many points as bid, then the pitchers party does not score at all and is instead set back by the amount of the bid.
===All fives===
In this scoring variant of blind all fours, in addition to the usual features the winner of a trick immediately scores the card points of any trumps it contains. Moreover, winning a trick that contains the Five of trumps immediately scores 5 points. The game is played for 61 points, ideally scored on a cribbage board. For determining the winner of the Game point, The Five of trumps is also worth 5 points. All other trumps and non-trumps have their usual card values.
===California jack===
This trick-and-draw variant was also known as &quot;French fours&quot;, &quot;French loo&quot; or &quot;Spanish all fours&quot;. Trumps is determined randomly before the deal. Each player receives only 3 cards. The remaining pack is used &quot;face up&quot; for drawing after each trick. Placing it face up ensures that revokes can be noticed. The point for low goes to the player who wins the lowest trump in a trick. If the stock is kept face down as usual this variant is known as Shasta Sam.

<text>Guildford () is a town in west Surrey, England, around south-west of central London. As of the 2011 census, the town has a population of about 77,000 and is the seat of the wider Borough of Guildford, which had around inhabitants in . The name &quot;Guildford&quot; is thought to derive from a crossing of the River Wey, a tributary of the River Thames that flows through the town centre.

The earliest evidence of human activity in the area is from the Mesolithic and Guildford is mentioned in the will of Alfred the Great from . The exact location of the main Anglo-Saxon settlement is unclear and the current site of the modern town centre may not have been occupied until the early 11th century. Following the Norman Conquest, a motte-and-bailey castle was constructed; which was developed into a royal residence by Henry III. During the late Middle Ages, Guildford prospered as a result of the wool trade, and the town was granted a charter of incorporation by Henry VII in 1488.

The River Wey Navigation between Guildford and the Thames was opened in 1653, facilitating the transport of produce, building materials and manufactured items to new markets in London. The arrival of the railways in the 1840s attracted further investment and the town began to grow with the construction of its first new suburb at Charlotteville in the 1860s. The town became the centre of a new Anglican diocese in 1927 and the foundation stone of the cathedral was laid in 1936. Guildford became a university town in September 1966, when the University of Surrey was established by Royal Charter.

Guildford is surrounded on three sides by the Surrey Hills National Landscape, which severely limits its potential for expansion to the east, west and south. Recent development has been focused to the north of the town in the direction of Woking. Guildford now officially forms the southwestern tip of the Greater London Built-up Area, as defined by the Office for National Statistics.

==Toponymy==
The oldest surviving record of Guildford is from a copy of the will of Alfred the Great, in which the settlement appears as &quot;Gyldeforda&quot;. The name is written as &quot;Gildeford&quot; in Domesday Book and later as &quot;Gyldeford&quot; (), &quot;Guldeford&quot; () and &quot;Guildeford&quot; (1226). The first part of the name is thought to derive from the Old English &quot;gylde&quot;, meaning gold, possibly referring to the colour of the sand to the south of the town, or to a local concentration of yellow flowers such as the common or marsh marigold. The second part of the name (&quot;ford&quot;) refers to a crossing of the River Wey.

==History==
===Early history===

The earliest evidence of human activity in the Guildford area is from St Catherine&#x27;s Hill, where Mesolithic flint tools have been found. There may also have been Bronze Age and Iron Age settlements on the hill. The areas now occupied by Christ&#x27;s College and Manor Farm were farmed in the Bronze Age, Iron Age and Roman period. Traces of a 2nd-century villa were discovered at Broadstreet Common during an excavation in 1998.

===Anglo-Saxon period===
There is thought to have been an Anglo-Saxon settlement in the Guildford area by the early 6th century, although its precise location is unclear. Excavations in the 1930s revealed a Saxon cemetery at Guildown at the east end of the Hog&#x27;s Back. Burials took place at the site up to the mid-11th century, but the oldest skeletons were buried in the late 6th century.
The first written record of Guildford is from the will of Alfred the Great, dated to around 880, in which the settlement was left to his nephew, Aethelwold. Although it does not appear in the Burghal Hidage, compiled , by the end of the 10th century the town was sufficiently important to be the location of a Royal Mint. Coins were struck at Guildford from 978 until at least 1099.

Around 220 of the skeletons excavated at Guildown are thought to be the remains of soldiers massacred during the arrest of Alfred Aetheling in 1035 or 1036. Contemporary accounts are somewhat contradictory, but the modern consensus is that Aetheling, a pretender to the throne and the brother of Edward the Confessor, was travelling through Guildford with a large bodyguard when the incident occurred. Aetheling was arrested by Godwin, Earl of Wessex and his men were killed. Many of the skeletons showed evidence of a violent death and the skulls of two were between their legs, suggesting that they had been executed by decapitation. Aetheling was taken to Ely, where he was blinded, and he is thought to have died there in February 1036.
The oldest extant building in Guildford is St Mary&#x27;s Church, the tower of which was built . Its location, on Quarry Street, may indicate that, at the time of its construction, the High Street had either not been laid out or was not the principal road. There is no significant archaeological evidence of human activity in the modern town centre before the 11th century and it is possible that, for the majority of the Saxon period, Stoke next Guildford, to the north, was the primary area of settlement.

===Governance===
In Domesday Book of 1086, Guildford appears as &quot;Gildeford&quot; and is divided into seven parts, all of which were the property of William I. Two of the areas were held by reeves and four were held by lesser tenants, one of whom was Ranulf Flambard. The land directly controlled by the king included 175 homagers (heads of household), who lived in 75 &quot;hagae&quot;. Flambard&#x27;s holding included three &quot;hagae&quot; that accommodated six homagers and, in total, the town provided an annual income of £30 for the king. William I is also listed as holding Stoke-by-Guildford, which had a population of 24 villagers, ten smallholders and five slaves. The manor had sufficient land for 22 plough teams, 16 acres of meadow, woodland for 40 swine and two mills.

Guildford remained a property of the Crown throughout the Middle Ages and several kings, including Henry II and John are known to have visited regularly. Henry III granted the town its first borough charter in January 1257, which permitted it to send two representatives to parliament. In August of the same year, he designated Guildford as the location of the Surrey County Court and Assizes. In 1366, Edward III issued a fee farm grant, enabling the town to become partially self-governing in exchange for a yearly rent of £10. Henry VII was responsible for granting Guildford its coat of arms in 1485 and, three years later, he awarded the charter of incorporation, which placed the administration of the borough in the hands of a mayor and burgesses, appointed from the merchants&#x27; guild.

The modern system of local government began to emerge in the 1830s. Under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, a democratically elected council replaced the mayor and burgesses, and the borough expanded beyond the medieval town boundaries. A year later, the Guildford Poor Law Union was formed, with responsibility for a total area of stretching from Godalming to Woking. As a result of the Local Government Act 1888, several responsibilities were transferred from the borough to the newly formed Surrey County Council. The borough boundaries were extended again in both 1904 and 1933. The final enlargement took place in March 1974, when the present local authority was created from the merger of the borough with the Guildford Rural District.

===Guildford Castle===
Guildford Castle is to the south of the modern town centre. Although it is not explicitly mentioned in Domesday Book, it is possible that it was included in one of the areas of land held by Ranulf Flambard. The date of its original construction is uncertain, but the consensus among historians is that it was built as a motte-and-bailey castle soon after the Norman Conquest. A polygonal stone shell keep was built in chalk and flint rubblestone around the top of the motte in the early 12th Century, the remains of which are still visible.

The square keep, known as the Great Tower, was constructed in the mid-12th century from Bargate stone. Originally built with only two floors, it was a &quot;solar keep&quot; and functioned primarily as a private residence, rather than as an administrative centre. At an unknown later date, a third storey was built directly on top of the crenelations, to bring the structure to its present height. Part of the keep was in use as a prison by the end of the 12th century and new, royal apartments were constructed in the 13th century in the southwestern corner. Henry III commissioned the rebuilding of the castle following a fire in the mid-13th century, converting it into one of the most luxurious palaces in England. In 1245, he bought land to extend the castle grounds and Castle Arch was constructed on his orders in 1256.

The castle ceased to be a royal residence in the Tudor period and it was leased from the Crown by Francis Carter in the reign of James I. A Parliamentary survey in 1650 noted that the keep was still habitable, although the associated outbuildings are thought to have been ruinous by this time. In 1885, the borough purchased the castle grounds and opened them to the public three years later.

===Guildford Friary===

The Guildford Black Friary was a community of Dominicans, founded by Eleanor of Provence, wife of Henry III, around 1275. It occupied a site of around beside the River Wey, to the north of the Town Ditch (now North Street). Excavations in the 1970s revealed that the original buildings were arranged around three sides of a central cloister, with a church to the south, chapter house to the east and kitchen to the north. The community was never large; in 1336 there were only 20 friars and by the time of its dissolution in 1537, there were only seven. In the late Tudor period, the building was occasionally used as a royal residence until 1606, when it was demolished and the materials used for construction projects elsewhere in the town.

In 1630, John Annandale purchased the friary grounds and built a house there. The property passed through a series of private owners until 1794, when it was bought by the War Office. It was used as a barracks until the end of the Napoleonic Wars and then demolished in 1818. The grounds are indicated on an 1841 map of Guildford as the &quot;Barrack Field&quot; and shortly afterwards the area was divided into plots and sold for housebuilding. In 1858, the Chennel family set up a steam-powered flour mill on the site of the friary church and cloisters, which was subsequently purchased and converted to a brewery by Thomas Taunton in the 1870s. In 1956, the brewery merged with the Meux Brewery of Nine Elms to form Friary Meux. The combined company was taken over by Allied Breweries in 1963 Brewing ceased in December 1968 and the site was sold to the developer, MEPC plc. The brewery was demolished in 1974 and, after archaeological investigations had been concluded, construction of the Friary Centre began in 1978.

===Transport and communications===
The eastwest route along the North Downs has been in use since ancient times. In the late 19th century it was dubbed the Pilgrims Way, but there is no convincing evidence of its use by pilgrims. The route consists of multiple parallel tracks and hollow ways running along the top of and beneath the North Downs escarpment and is typical of other ridgeway routes in the UK and Europe. Similarly, the path alongside the River Wey, running broadly northsouth, is also likely to have been used since antiquity. By the Tudor period, this route had become an important military supply line, linking London and Chatham to Portsmouth. A turnpike road through Guildford, between London and Portsmouth, was created in 1749 and nine years later the roads across the Hog&#x27;s Back and towards Leatherhead were also turnpiked. The present Farnham Road was built . The most recent major change to the local road network was the opening of the A3 Guildford Bypass in 1934.
The River Wey has been used for navigation since ancient times and during the Medieval period, there is thought to have been a wharf at Millmead. The River Wey Navigation was authorised by Act of Parliament in 1651. Twelve locks (including two flood locks), and of new cuts were constructed between the River Thames and Guildford, and the waterway opened in 1653. The navigation had a positive impact on the economy of west Surrey. By the end of the 17th century, timber was being transported via the river from the county boundary with West Sussex and in 1724, Daniel Defoe wrote that corn from Farnham was being sent by barge to London. The Act also allowed passengers to be transported via the Wey and the maximum one-way fare was capped at 1s, which was raised in 1671 to 1s 4d.

The Godalming Navigation was authorised in 1760 and was completed four years later. Four locks were built as part of the works and the Town Bridge was altered to allow barges to pass beneath it. The period of the American War of Independence (17751783) was particularly profitable for the two waterways, and a total of 17,000 tonnes of cargo was transported in 1776. Traffic on the Wey and Godalming Navigations declined following the opening of the railway lines in the late 1840s. The National Trust acquired the two waterways in the 1960s and have owned them ever since.
The first railway to be constructed in Surrey was the London to Southampton line, which opened in stages from May 1838. Woking railway station, was built on the south side of the tracks for the convenience of those travelling by stagecoach from Guildford and quickly became the for the western half of the county. Guildford railway station opened in 1845 as the terminus of a branch from Woking. Four years later, the line was extended to and the Reading, Guildford and Reigate Railway opened at the same time. The final railway line, the line from Surbiton via Effingham Junction was opened in February 1888, with a new station to the northeast of the town centre, which was later named .

===Commerce and industry===
It is unclear when the first market took place at Guildford, but by 1276 one was being held in the High Street every Saturday. In the 1530s, there were three markets each week, for corn (the most profitable), for cattle, and for general produce and household items. In 1561, a market house was built &quot;beneath the Gild Hall&quot;, but by 1626 it was no longer suitable to store the &quot;graine accustimablie sold there&quot; and the corn market was moved to the Tun Inn on the south side of the High Street. A purpose-built Corn Exchange was erected there in 1818. In 1865, the market was relocated to North Street and in 1895, it moved to Woodbridge Road.

Guildford&#x27;s early prosperity was founded on the wool trade. The North Downs provided good grazing land for sheep, there were local deposits of Fuller&#x27;s earth in Surrey and the Wey provided a source of both water and power for fulling mills. The town specialised in the manufacture of kersey, a coarse cloth, dyed and sold as &quot;Guildford Blue&quot;. The Italian merchant, Francesco di Marco Datini, is known to have purchased cloth from Guildford in the late 14th century and by the end of the 16th century, there were at least six dye works in the town. The trade began to decline at the end of the Tudor period, possibly as a result of fraudulent activity on the part of the wool merchants, who were accused of stretching the cloth. Attempts to revive the struggling industry in the early 17th century were unsuccessful and the last remaining fulling mill was converted to grind corn in 1714.

After the death of their father in 1882, brothers Charles Arthur and Leonard Gates took over the running of his shop, which held the local distribution franchise for Gilbey&#x27;s wines and spirits, and also sold beer. However, in 1885, the brothers were persuaded to join the temperance movement, and they poured their entire stock into the gutters of the High Street. Left with no livelihood, they converted their now empty shop into a dairy. Using a milk separator, they bought milk from local farmers, and after extracting the cream and whey, sold the skim back to the farmers for pig feed. In 1888 three more of the Gates brothers and their sons joined the business, which led to the formal registration of the company under the name of the West Surrey Central Dairy Company, which after the development of its dried milk baby formula in 1906 became Cow &amp; Gate.

In 1900, the Dennis Brothers company constructed what was probably the first purpose-built car factory in the country, on Bridge Street. This is now known as the Rodboro Buildings, after a later occupant. The company soon outgrew the site, and between 1905 and 1913 production was gradually moved to a new factory near Woodbridge Hill.

===Guildford in the World Wars===
At the start of the Second World War, 2500 children were evacuated from southwest London to the Guildford area and in June the following year, evacuees arrived from Brighton. The borough council built 18 communal air raid shelters, including the shelter at Foxenden Quarry, capable of accommodating 1000 people. In late 1940, six British Restaurants were opened in the town and, in May the following year, the first nursery school for children aged between two and five was opened, enabling their mothers to participate in war work. Over the course of the war, seven people were killed in the town as a result of enemy bombing, three of whom died when a V-1 flying bomb landed in Aldersey Road in August 1944.
At the start of the war, Stoughton Barracks became a training centre for army recruits and George VI visited twice in late 1939. The defence of the town was the responsibility of the 4th Battalion of Surrey Home Guard and defensive installations included dragon&#x27;s teeth close to London Road station, numerous pillboxes and an anti-tank ditch that was dug across Stoke Park. Local factories were rededicated to the war effort: The Dennis works produced Churchill tanks, water pumps, bombs and aircraft parts, RFD in Stoke Road produced life rafts and flotation aids for the Royal Navy and Warner Engineering produced tank tracks and brass bomb noses.

===Cathedral and University===
The Diocese of Guildford was created in 1927 out of the northern part of the Diocese of Winchester. Holy Trinity Church, the largest church in the town, became the cathedral. However, by May of the following year, it was obvious that it was too small to hold the status permanently and the Diocesan Conference resolved to build a new cathedral in the town. In November 1927, The Earl of Onslow offered of land at the summit of Stag Hill as the site.

The design of the cathedral, by Edward Maufe, was chosen following an open competition. The building is constructed of bricks made from the clay excavated for the foundations and crypt. The foundation stone was laid in 1936, but by the outbreak of the Second World War, only the choir had been completed. The crypt was finished following the end of the war and was dedicated in 1947. Building work on the rest of the structure was also resumed and the consecration service took place on 17 May 1961. Construction work finally ceased in 1965.

The campaign to found a university in Guildford began as an initiative of the local Rotary Club in 1962, to explore an approach to the University Grants Commission. At around the same time, the governors of the Battersea College of Advanced Technology were looking for a new campus, as their institution had outgrown its own south London site. A year later, the Robbins Report recommended that all colleges of advanced technology should be given the status of universities. In May 1963, Edward Boyle, the Secretary of State for Education, announced that the Battersea College would relocate to Guildford as the University of Surrey. The northern part of Stag Hill was chosen as the campus and the construction of the first buildings began in January 1966. The Royal Charter was granted in September of the same year and the first students were officially admitted in the autumn of 1968.

===Guildford pub bombings===
On the evening of 5 October 1974, the Provisional Irish Republican Army detonated two gelignite bombs at two pubs in the town. The venues are thought to have been chosen as they were popular with off-duty military personnel from Aldershot Garrison. The first bomb exploded at the Horse and Groom in North Street at 8:50 pm, killing two members of the Scots Guards, two members of the Women&#x27;s Royal Army Corps and one civilian. The second exploded around 35 minutes later at the Seven Stars in Swan Lane, injuring six members of staff and one customer.

In early December 1974, Surrey Police arrested three men and a woman, later collectively known as the Guildford Four. A few days later, seven further individuals were arrested who became known as the Maguire Seven. The Guildford Four were convicted for carrying out the bombings in October 1975 and received life sentences. All four maintained their innocence and, after a campaign of almost fifteen years, their convictions were quashed in October 1989.

===Modern Guildford===
In the 21st century Guildford still has a High Street paved with granite setts, and is one of the most expensive places to buy property in the UK outside London. The town has a general street market held on Fridays and Saturdays. A farmers&#x27; market is usually held on the first Tuesday of each month. There is a Tourist Information Office, guided walks and various hotels including the historic Angel Hotel which long served as a coaching stop on the main London to Portsmouth stagecoach route.

==Geography==
===Eastern districts===
Charlotteville is one of the first planned suburbs in Britain. The estate was funded by a local doctor, Thomas Sells, and named after his wife, Charlotte. It was developed by the Guildford architect Henry Peak in 1862 and is loosely bound between Shalford Road and Sydenham Road, encompassing the beauty spot of Pewley Down. The area&#x27;s roads were named after English doctors, including Addison Road, Cheselden Road, Harvey Road and Jenner Road. Public footpaths lead from the town through Charlotteville to the downs and towards St Martha&#x27;s Hill and Albury. It houses a great many cottages and a few large, mostly privately owned properties. The official designation of the heart of Charlotteville as a conservation area means that Peak&#x27;s work may survive. The development introduced institutions such as the Cork Club, the Charlotteville Cycling Club, founded in 1903 with the then mayor as its first president, and the Charlotteville Jubilee Trust charity, formed at the time of the Golden Jubilee. Two schools were established in the village - one infant and one junior school. merging to form the Holy Trinity Pewley Down School in the late 2000s. The last of the shops closed in 2006.

Stoke next Guildford, the central northern area of the town, contains Stoke Park and the historic manor of Stoke at its centre, now the site of Guildford College. To the north of the park is the Guildford Spectrum leisure and sports centre. To the south of this mostly residential neighbourhood is London Road railway station, On Stoke Road there is a listed hotel, &quot;The Stoke&quot;.

Burpham and Merrow are former villages that are now major suburbs of Guildford.

===Northern districts===

Bellfields is a suburb in the north of Guildford lying adjacent to Slyfield Industrial Estate and Stoughton. The area includes private estates as well as current and former social housing estates. Christ&#x27;s College, Guildford&#x27;s senior school and Pond Meadow special needs school are in Bellfields. The neighbourhood includes St Peter&#x27;s Shared Church and the Guildford Family Centre.

Slyfield is a small mixed land-use area north of Guildford that is largely indeterminate from Bellfields, however to its east is Guildford&#x27;s largest industrial and commercial park, Slyfield Industrial Estate. There was a cattle market held in the south of the industrial area until 2000 which moved to Maidstone, Kent. Slyfield has a community hall and a school, Weyfield Primary. To the north of Slyfield is Stoke Hill, on top of which is a park, Stringer&#x27;s Common, across which is the Jacobs Well neighbourhood which is part of Worplesdon civil parish.
Stoughton is a mainly residential suburb north of Guildford town centre. It is the location of the former Stoughton Barracks, which was redeveloped for housing in the 1990s and renamed Cardwell&#x27;s Keep. In Stoughton is &quot;The Wooden Bridge&quot; pub where both the Rolling Stones and Eric Clapton performed concerts at the early stages of their respective careers. Another pub of historic note was &quot;The Royal Hotel&quot; in Worplesdon Road, which hosted an early U2 concert and was owned by the former wrestler Mick McManus. This is now a Chinese restaurant. Stoughton has one junior school, Northmead Junior School and one infant school, Stoughton Infant School.

Jacob&#x27;s Well is another former village that is now a major suburb of Guildford.

===Western districts===

Guildford Park and Dennisville are small residential neighbourhoods immediately south of and at the foot of Stag Hill. Dennisville was founded in 1934 to provide accommodation for workers at Dennis Brothers Woodbridge Hill factory. Both neighbourhoods are close to Guildford railway station to the southeast and become, without division, Onslow Village to the south. As the University occupies the top and north of Stag Hill, it is a popular location for student lodgings.
Onslow Village is a sloped suburb on the western outskirts of Guildford. It, with one outlying road continuation, forms a wedge between the A3 road and A31 roads south of the junction of the A3 and Egerton Road, Guildford&#x27;s &quot;Cathedral Turn&quot; and directly below Henley Fort, the 1880s built London Defence Position and a Scheduled Monument. The area consists of a number of residential streets many of which are characterised by beech hedges. Parts of Onslow Village have been designated as conservation areas, enforcing a number of planning restrictions that are intended to protect the character and identity of the locality. Local amenities include the 5th Guildford Scout Group, a community news website, a Tennis Club and Onslow Arboretum. It also has its own football team, Onslow FC, established in 1986.

There is a small village centre, with a parade of shops and a village hall. Onslow has one infant school, Onslow Infant School, as well as Queen Eleanor&#x27;s School, a primary school. The local Anglican church is All Saints.

The Village also has a Residents&#x27; association, the Onslow Village Residents&#x27; Association (OVRA) which was set up in 1956 and whose object is to &quot;safeguard the amenities of Onslow village and to promote the welfare, interests and well-being of the residents&quot;. 

The Onslow Village Society was formed with the aim to tackle the acute shortage of decent working-class housing following the First World War. Onslow Village Ltd acquired or just over a square mile of land from the Earl of Onslow in 1920 for approximately one-quarter of its market value at the time. The aim was to create a garden city to be modelled on the ideas of Ebenezer Howard&#x27;s Garden City Movement. It was their intention to build a self-contained community with smallholdings, public buildings, open spaces, recreation grounds, woodland and a railway station, as well as developing sites for churches, hotels and factories. On Saturday 1 May 1920, ten weeks after the formation of the Society, the foundations of the first two houses were laid and by March 1922 ninety-one houses had been built. Due to a lack of funding the scheme never reached full completion, with about 600 houses actually being built. Original drawings however showed that there were further plans to develop the farmland at Manor Farm, north of the A3. By the mid-1970s, one-third of the properties were still owned by Onslow Village Ltd. Then, in 1984, the company was wound up and many shareholders and tenants had the chance to buy their homes at affordable prices.

Onslow Village never got its railway station, however, it did eventually get its woodland: the Onslow arboretum, developed by Guildford Borough Council as a specialist collection of eighty tree species from around the world. The Onslow arboretum is located right next to the recreation area which has its own park, a large field, several tennis courts, toilets and a scout hut.
Park Barn consists of a former and present social housing estate in Guildford. It is bordered to the south by the railway line, the east by Westborough, the north by Rydes Hill and the west by Broadstreet Common. The estate is home to King&#x27;s College, a school for 11 – 16-year-olds. There are also a number of primary schools in the area of Park Barn, including Guildford Grove Primary School, which has a specialist sign-supported rescue base on the site that supports pupils with profound hearing impairments, known as The Lighthouse. The Football team, Park Barn FC, plays in League 4 of the Guildford and Woking Alliance League. Guildford City Boxing Club moved from Bellfields to Cabell Road in Park Barn in 2014.
Adjacent to the Park Barn Estate, the Westborough Estate was built in the 1920s due to the growing population at the start of the 20th century. Westborough is home to a United Reformed church and to a community primary school on Southway. There is a small parade of shops where Southway meets Aldershot Road. Westborough is also a ward of the Borough of Guildford. Its population at the 2011 Census was 9,307.

==National and local government==
The town is in the parliamentary constituency of Guildford. As of 2024, it is represented at Westminster by Liberal Democrat Zöe Franklin.

Councillors are elected to Surrey County Council every four years. The town is covered by five divisions, each of which elects one councillor. The five divisions are: &quot;Guildford East&quot;, &quot;Guildford North&quot;, &quot;Guildford South-East&quot;, &quot;Guildford South-West&quot; and &quot;Guildford West&quot;. Although Guildford has historically been regarded as the county town of Surrey, the county council itself has its administrative headquarters in Reigate.

Elections to the borough council take place every four years and a total of 48 councillors serve at any one time. The council is led by an executive committee, consisting of the Leader, a Deputy Leader and six portfolio holders. Each year, one of the councillors serves as &quot;Mayor of Guildford&quot; for a period of twelve months. The role of mayor is primarily ceremonial and the post has little political power. Since April 1982, the council has been based at the Grade II-listed Millmead House, which was built in the late 17th and early 18th centuries.

Guildford has been twinned with Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany since 1979. A link between Guildford and Mukono, Uganda, was established in 2003 and the borough council signed a formal partnership agreement with Dongying, China, in 2017.

==Demography and housing==
In the 2011 census, the population of Guildford was 79,185. 87.3% of the inhabitants were white, 7.1% were of Asian descent and 2.2% were mixed race.

==Business==

The 2011 &quot;Financial Times&quot; annual list of Top 500 Global Companies listed five major businesses with a significant presence in the town; Philips, Ericsson, Colgate-Palmolive, Allianz and Sanofi.

Media Molecule, Lionhead Studios, Hello Games, Criterion Games, Ghost Games and Bullfrog Productions have helped the town become a centre for video game production. The electronic components business, discoverIE Group, with some 4,400 employees, is based at Surrey Research Park.

Military vehicle builders Automotive Technik have a factory in the town. The Surrey Research Park contains a number of world leading companies including satellite manufacturers Surrey Satellite Technology and BOC.

==Public services==
===Utilities===
Until the start of the 18th century, residents of Guildford obtained their water from wells or from the Wey. In 1701, William Yarnold received a grant from the borough corporation to erect a waterwheel and pumps to raise river water to a reservoir at the foot of Pewley Down. A network of pipes, formed from the hollow trunks of elm trees, was installed to distribute water through the town. A new well was sunk in the town in 1865, but contamination by sewage resulted in an outbreak of typhoid fever. By 1898, the mains water infrastructure in the town was well-developed and included both gas- and coal-powered pumps. In 1952, the Guildford Corporation sold the town&#x27;s water supply infrastructure to the Guildford, Godalming and District Water Board.

The town sewerage system, including the wastewater treatment works at Bellfields, was constructed between 1889 and 1895. The current sewage works date from the 1960s, but will be relocated to a site to the north, as part of the Slyfield Area Regeneration Project. The move will release land for up to 1500 new homes. The new works are expected to open in 2026.

The first gasworks in Guildford was opened in 1824 and street lighting was installed in May of that year. The construction of a larger facility was authorised by parliament in 1857. The gasworks closed in the late 1960s and the area was cleared for the construction of the Bedford Road Sports Centre and the associated car park. Since 2000, part of the site has been occupied by the Odeon Cinema complex.
The first electricity-generating station was opened in 1896 in Onslow Street with an installed capacity of 60 kW. It was rebuilt and extended in 1913 and was replaced in May 1928 by a new plant in Woodbridge Road. Under the Electricity (Supply) Act 1926, Guildford was connected to the National Grid, initially to a 33 kV supply ring, which linked the town to Woking, Godalming, Farnham, Hindhead and Aldershot. The electricity industry was nationalised in 1948 and ownership of the Woodbridge Road station passed to the British Electricity Authority and then to the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB). In 1966 the power station had a generating capacity of 11.25 megawatts (MW) and delivered 9,090 MWh of electricity. The CEGB closed the station in 1968 and it was subsequently demolished.

There have been small-scale renewable electricity installations in Guildford since the start of the 20th century. In around 1907, the inventor, E. Lancaster Burne, erected one of the first wind turbines on Pewley Hill to generate electricity for his house. A hydroelectric project to harness power from the River Wey opened in the former Toll House, part of the Town Mill on Millmead, in 2006. The building, first constructed in 1897, originally housed turbines to pump river water to a reservoir on Pewley Hill. Over its first ten years of operation, the installation generated over 1.5 GWh of electricity, which was supplied direct to the national grid.

===Emergency services and justice===
The first police force in Guildford was established by the Guildford Watch Committee in 1836, which appointed nine constables, led by a part-time superintendent. In 1851, it briefly merged with the Surrey Constabulary, responsible for much of the rest of the county, but the two were separated again three years later. By 1866, the Guilford force had sixteen officers, one of whom had a salary paid by the LSWR. Five additional officers were employed in 1932, when the borough was enlarged.

Between 1840 and 1864, severe outbursts of semi-organised lawlessness, commonly known as the &quot;Guy Riots&quot;, occurred in Guildford. The violence was focused on celebrations for the Fifth of November, but was amplified by local political issues. The rioters would rampage through the town after nightfall, damaging property and assaulting local residents. Following severe lawlessness in March and September 1863, 200 soldiers were dispatched to the town in anticipation of further violence that November. The army was able to disperse the rioters and four ringleaders were arrested. They were sentenced to hard labour the following April and there was no repeat of the violence in subsequent years.

In 1941, the Guildford police force was amalgamated again with the Surrey Constabulary as a wartime efficiency measure and the merger became permanent in 1947. The following year, the combined force moved its headquarters to Mount Browne in Sandy Lane. As of 2022, the local police force is Surrey Police and Guildford Police Station is at Margaret Road, GU1 4QS, on the site of the former cattle market.
Guildford Fire Brigade was founded in 1863 as a volunteer force. Initially the horse-drawn fire engine was housed in a shed in North Street, but a brick building (now the public toilets) was built in the same road in 1872 The Guildford Brigade merged with others in Surrey in 1947, when the service became the responsibility of the county council. In 2022, the fire authority for Guildford is Surrey County Council and the town fire station is at Ladymead.

The ambulance service in Guildford was provided by St John Ambulance until 1966, when the county council set up its own service. In 2022, local ambulance services are run by the South East Coast Ambulance Service and the ambulance station is on London Road.

===Healthcare===

The first medical facility in the town, the Guildford Dispensary, opened in Quarry Street in January 1860. Supported by private donations, it provided free medical care to the poor, including a home visiting service and an out-patients clinic. During its first year of operation over a thousand patients were treated, highlighting the urgent need for a public hospital in the area. The dispensary closed in 1866, when the Royal Surrey County Hospital opened on Farnham Road.

The land for Farnham Road Hospital was donated by Lord Onslow and was built as a memorial to Prince Albert, who had died in 1861. It opened in 1866 with the name Royal Surrey County Hospital with two wards and 60 beds. In 1948, it became part of the NHS. It acquired its current name in 1980. In 2022, Farnham Road Hospital is a specialist mental health hospital.

The Guildford Infirmary was built in the grounds of the workhouse in 1896 and was initially run by the Guildford Guardians of the Poor. It was renamed the Warren Road Hospital in 1930, when it was taken over by Surrey County Council. Shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War, an annexe was built to treat both military and civilian casualties and the hospital became part of the Emergency Hospital Service. In 1945, it became St Luke&#x27;s Hospital and three years later it was incorporated into the NHS. It ceased to be a general hospital in January 1980, when much of its operations were transferred to the Royal Surrey County Hospital. St Luke&#x27;s continued to house a nurses&#x27; training facility and to offer outpatients services until 1991. The site finally closed in 1999 and had been redeveloped by 2003.

The current Royal Surrey County Hospital, at Park Barn, opened in stages from January 1980, inheriting its name from its predecessor, which continues to operate as the Farnham Road Hospital. The St Luke&#x27;s Wing opened in February 1997, following the closure of St Luke&#x27;s Hospital. The Royal Surrey County Hospital is the nearest hospital to Guildford town centre with an Accident and Emergency Department.

Other institutions in Guildford include Guildford College of Further and Higher Education (which also occupies the site of the former Guildford School of Art), Academy of Contemporary Music and the Italia Conti Arts Centre.

==Places of worship==

===Anglican churches===

The Church of England churches in the town belong to the Guildford Deanery, part of the Diocese of Guildford. All six of the churches are listed, including two that are Grade I listed.

St Mary&#x27;s Church, on Quarry Street, is the oldest place of worship in the town. The tower is thought to have been built before the Norman Conquest and the transepts were constructed in . Many structural features have survived from the medieval period, although much of today&#x27;s church dates from a restoration in 1882. The oldest part of Holy Trinity Church, at the east end of the High Street, is the Weston Chapel, which dates from . The original building is thought to have been constructed in the early medieval period, but it was rebuilt between 1749 and 1763 after the steeple collapsed and destroyed the majority of the building on 23 April 1740. The windows in the nave were altered by Henry Woodyer in 1869 and the transepts were added by Arthur Blomfield in 1888. The original St Nicolas Church, at the western end of the Town Bridge, is also thought to have been constructed in the early medieval period. The Loseley Chapel dates from the 15th century, but the rest of the building was rebuilt in the 1870 by the Gothic Revival architect, Samuel Sanders Teulon.

The oldest parts of the Church of St John the Evangelist at Stoke-next-Guildford were built in the early 14th century. The tower was added in the 15th century and the north chapel in the 16th, when the north aisle was widened. The church includes stained glass designed by Dante Gabriel Rossetti and a monument by John Flaxman. Christ Church, in Waterden Road, was designed by Ewan Christian in 1868 in the 13th-century English Gothic style. The Church of St Saviour, in Woodbridge Road, was consecrated in 1899 and was built in the 14th-century Gothic style.

===Other Christian churches===

There are three Roman Catholic churches in Guildford, St Joseph&#x27;s near the town centre, St Mary&#x27;s in Rydes Hill, and St Pius X in Merrow. The Catholic Parish of Guildford also includes the Church of St Edmund the Confessor at Sutton Place. There are two United Reformed Churches, two Baptist Churches a New Life Baptist Church, a Christadelphian meeting hall, two Methodist Churches, the Salvation Army,
Bethel Chapel, Brethren Assembly, Church in a Club Stoughton, Elim Penecostal Church, Chinese Christian Fellowship, and five Independent Churches

===Quaker meeting house===
The first Quaker meetings in Guildford are thought to have taken place in 1668 and a burial ground was purchased five years later in North Street. The current meeting house, in Ward Street, was completed in 1806 and retains its original, panelled meeting room.

===Jewish synagogues===

In 1995, a chamber was discovered in the High Street, which is considered to be the remains of the 12th-century Guildford Synagogue. While this remains a matter of contention, it is likely to be the oldest surviving former synagogue in Western Europe. The modern-day synagogue, in York Road, was opened in December 1978.

==Culture==

Guildford House Gallery, in the High Street, is run by Guildford Borough Council. Its art collection includes works of Guildford and the surrounding area, and works by Guildford artists, most notably John Russell.

In Sir Thomas Malory&#x27;s 1470 version of the Arthurian romances, &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, Guildford is identified with Astolat of Arthurian renown. Continuing the Arthurian connection, there is a local public house, the Astolat. Guildford has been associated with the 1863 novel &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; because of its importance in the life of its author, Lewis Carroll. There are several reminders of this connection throughout the town. Guildford Museum has a collection of items belonging to Carroll, see above. In addition to this, sculptor Jean Argent created two full-size bronze sculptures of Alice passing through the Looking-Glass and Alice and the White Rabbit, which can be found in the Castle Grounds and by the River Wey at Millmead respectively. In &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; by Douglas Adams, the character Ford Prefect, actually an alien from Betelgeuse, claims to be an out-of-work actor from Guildford. &quot;Crime at Guildford&quot; (1935), a novel by Freeman Wills Crofts, is set in the town.

Guildford has been captured on film in &quot;Carry On Sergeant&quot;, which was filmed at the former Queens Barracks, and &quot;The Omen&quot;, a scene from which was filmed at Guildford Cathedral.

The town&#x27;s principal commercial theatre is the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre, which often shows productions after they have spent time in London&#x27;s West End. The Electric Theatre opened in 1997 to host performances by musicians and amateur drama groups. It also hosts regular film, family and music festivals as well as comedy, and has a Riverside Cafe Bar and Terrace.

Guildford Shakespeare Company performs in the town, using the bandstand in the castle grounds as the stage in the summer and several churches close to the High Street through the winter.

Guildford has an Odeon cinema multiplex, which in June 2007 was the first cinema in the world to show digital 4K films to the public. Guildford Civic Hall was the town&#x27;s main arts and entertainment venue until it closed in January 2004. The Civic Hall was replaced by a new venue, G Live, which opened on the same site in September 2011. In 2009 the Mill Studio in Guildford featured the English premiere of the one-woman musical, &quot;Estelle Bright&quot;, starring actress/singer Sarah Tullamore.

The Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra, founded as the Guildford Municipal Orchestra, received full council funding from 1945 until it was withdrawn in 2012. The orchestra was disbanded in March 2013, with Guildford Borough Council providing a classical music grant to other organisations instead. Singer-songwriter Robyn Hitchcock has sung about the town in &quot;No, I Don&#x27;t Remember Guildford&quot;, a song from his 1999 album &quot;Jewels for Sophia&quot;.

Stoke Park, Guildford&#x27;s largest park, is the venue for the GuilFest music festival, which restarted in summer 2024 after a 10-year hiatus. Prior to 2007, the Ambient Picnic was held in Shalford Park, by the River Wey.

===Cricket===
Cricket is thought to have evolved from bat and ball games, played by children in southeast England during the Middle Ages. The first written record of the sport is from a witness statement by the Guildford resident and former Royal Grammar School pupil, John Derrick. In 1597 (old style, 1598 modern style), Derrick testified in a court case over the disputed enclosure of wasteland that, as a child, &quot;hee and his fellowes did runne and play there at Creckett and other plaies&quot;.

==Notable buildings and landmarks==
===Abbot&#x27;s Hospital===

The Hospital of the Holy Trinity, more commonly known as Abbot&#x27;s Hospital, was founded in 1622 by George Abbot, the Archbishop of Canterbury and a former pupil of the Royal Grammar School. It was not intended as a place for healing the sick, but instead provided accommodation for single people (initially 12 male and eight female), who had either been born in Guildford or who had lived there at least 20 years. The hospital also included a &quot;manufacture&quot; or workshop for the production of cloth, which was subsidised by the foundation&#x27;s endowments. Initially linen was woven, but from 1638 wool was produced instead. In 1656, the trustees successfully applied to the Court of Chancery to close the workshop and the funds were redirected to grants for the poor.

The hospital is constructed of dark red brick and is built around a central, rectangular courtyard. The four-storey gatehouse, on the High Street, faces Holy Trinity Church. Many of the rooms have panelling dating from the early 17th century and the chapel, in the northwest corner, retains its original wooden seating. The building was extended and refurbished in the 1980s, to improve the standard of the living accommodation.

===Dapdune Wharf===
Dapdune Wharf has been the main boatyard for the River Wey Navigation since the waterway was completed in 1653. Over the summer months, the National Trust runs a variety of trips on the Wey Navigation, starting from here, where there is a visitor centre.

===Guildford Institute===
The Guildford Institute was founded in March 1834 as the Guildford Mechanics&#x27; Institute to promote &quot;useful knowledge among the working classes&quot;. Its current premises, on North Street, were opened in 1892 and its activities were funded by a membership subscription. Following the Second World War, the Institute entered a period of decline, but its fortunes revived in the 1970s with a new management team and, from 1982, a 26-year partnership with the University of Surrey. A redevelopment project was launched in 2012 and was completed the following year. In 2022, the institute offers a wide range of courses, a lending library and archive, a vegan restaurant and aims to provide an educational, cultural and social hub for the local community.

===Guildford Museum===
The Guildford Museum was founded by the Surrey Archaeological Society, which relocated to Castle Arch House from Southwark in 1898. The building, thought to have been constructed , incorporates part of the 13th-century castle gateway. Although the public had been allowed limited access to the Society&#x27;s collections since its relocation to Guildford, the museum was not formally opened until 1907.

A new gallery, constructed in the Arts and Crafts style, was opened in 1911 to house objects donated by the horticulturalist, Gertrude Jekyll. In 1927–28, the adjacent early 19th century townhouse, 48 Quarry Street was acquired and was converted to house the Muniment Room. The borough council took over the running of the museum in 1933. In 2021, the collection numbers around 75,000 items and includes archaeological finds, textiles and clothing, and artefacts illustrating the social and industrial history of the town.

===The Guildhall===
The guild in Guildford was formed in the late 14th century shortly after 1366, when Edward III issued the fee farm grant, enabling the town to become self-governing in exchange for a yearly rent of £10. The first mention of a guildhall is from later in Edward&#x27;s reign, when repairs were carried out at some point before the king&#x27;s death in 1377. The current building is thought to have been constructed and was extended northwards in 1589. The council chamber and the exterior façade, facing the High Street, were created in 1683, funded by public subscription. The clock case dates from the same year, but the mechanism inside may be up to a century older. The original bell, which now stands in the entrance hall, was replaced in 1931 and may have previously been installed in St Martha&#x27;s Church.

===The Spike===

The building now known as The Spike, was constructed in 1906 as the Guildford Union Workhouse Casuals Ward. It was used to house any vagrants found on the streets of the town, who were to be detained for two nights and compelled to undertake hard labour. Four of the original thirteen stone breaking cells survive. Following the repeal of the Poor Laws in 1929, the building continued to be used as a hostel for the homeless. In the mid-1960s, it became the archive and document store for St Luke&#x27;s Hospital, which had been built on the rest of the former workhouse site. Since 2008, the building has functioned as joint community and heritage centre.

===The Undercroft===

The Undercroft, beneath 7274 High Street, is one of six cellars in the town centre that survive from the late-Medieval period. It is open twice a week.

==Parks and open spaces==
===Stoke Park===
Stoke Park is a large park on the edge of the town centre, with sports facilities and play areas. It was donated to the town in 1925 by Lord Onslow.

===Allen House Grounds===
Allen House, to the north of the Upper High Street, was built in the 17th century and took its name from Anthony Allen, who owned the property in the early 18th century. The house and its grounds were given to the Royal Grammar School in 1914 and the site was used to train local volunteer soldiers during the First World War. The building was used as a teaching annex by the school until 1964, when it was demolished to make way for a new classroom complex. The rest of the site was purchased by the borough council and is known today as the Allen House Grounds. Following a refurbishment in 2009, the site includes a formal garden, inspired by the poem &quot;Jabberwocky&quot;, by Lewis Carroll, a multi-sports court and a putting green.

===Pewley Down===
Pewley Down, located on a hill southeast of the town centre, is a Local Nature Reserve owned and managed by the borough council. The area of chalk grassland provides a habitat for six species of orchid, and 26 species of butterfly were recorded there in 2010.

<text>DISH Network L.L.C., often referred to as DISH, an abbreviation for Digital Sky Highway, is an American provider of satellite television and IPTV services and wholly owned subsidiary of EchoStar Corporation.

The company was originally established as EchoStar Communications, and first launched its satellite television services under the DISH Network brand in 1996, utilizing its EchoStar I satellite. In 2007, EchoStar spun off its infrastructural business and the brand itself under a separate entity under the EchoStar name with the existing company rebranding to DISH Network Corporation. Both companies would remain under the control of EchoStar&#x27;s co-founder Charlie Ergen. 

After the spin-off, the company pursued further acquisitions and business initiatives, including acquiring video rental chain Blockbuster in an attempt to compete with Netflix, releasing a new set-top digital video recorder (DVR) with the controversial ability to automatically skip commercials in recordings. In 2015, the company launched over-the-top IPTV services via the new subsidiary Sling TV. In 2020, the company acquired the mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) Boost Mobile from Sprint Corporation as part of its merger with T-Mobile US, announcing an intent to develop a national 5G network in order to supplant Sprint as a fourth major carrier. 

In 2023, DISH Network was merged back into EchoStar in an all-stock transaction.

==History==
===Founding, early growth and launch of DBS services===
The company was formed in 1980 as EchoStar Communications by Charlie Ergen, Candy Ergen, and Jim DeFranco, as a distributor of C-band satellite television systems. In 1987, EchoStar applied for a satellite television broadcast license with the FCC and was granted access to orbital slot 119° west longitude in 1992. A year after the launch of its first satellite, EchoStar I, EchoStar launched its DBS broadcast services under the DISH Network name on March 4, 1996. That launch marked the beginning of its television services under a subscription business model.

===Spin-off of infrastructural assets===
In January 2007, EchoStar Communications completed the corporate spin-off of its technology and infrastructure assets into a separate company under the EchoStar name, and the remainder of the company was renamed DISH Network Corporation.

=== Acquisitions and expansion ===
Joseph Clayton became president and chief executive officer of the company in June 2011, while Charlie Ergen remained chairman. Clayton remained in the position until March 31, 2015, when he retired, leaving Ergen to resume the post. In December 2017, Ergen was replaced by Erik Carlson. That same year, DISH Network spent over $3 billion in acquisitions of companies in bankruptcy, This included the April 6, 2011, purchase of Blockbuster in a bankruptcy auction for $322 million in cash and the assumption of $87 million in liabilities. DISH Network also acquired DBSD and TerreStar Corporation.

In September 2011, DISH would leverage Blockbuster&#x27;s existing video on-demand and DVD-by-mail services as part of a new offering known as &quot;Blockbuster Movie Pass&quot;—an add-on for DISH Network television service incorporating movie channels, access to Blockbuster On Demand, and DVD-by-mail with unlimited in-store exchanges. The offering was positioned as a competitor to Netflix, and Redbox, with Blockbuster having touted that it received new releases for rental sooner than its competitors due to agreements they had reached requiring a 28-day delay. DISH Network also made a bid to purchase Hulu in October 2011, but Hulu&#x27;s owners chose not to sell the company. 

In January 2013, DISH bid $5 billion for Clearwire to add wireless internet and mobile video services. In April 2013, it made a $25 billion bid for Sprint Corporation. In 2011, Dish petitioned the Federal Communications Commission to combine the S-Band spectrum it acquired from DBSD and Terrestar, and combine this spectrum with LTE. Unlike LightSquared, Dish&#x27;s spectrum has minimal risk of disrupting Global Positioning Systems.

At the 2012 Consumer Electronics Show, DISH Network announced it would shorten its trade name to &quot;DISH&quot;, to emphasize new developments such as its Hopper DVR and broadband services.

After changing the position of a satellite orbital position from being over Mexico to Brazil in 2011, DISH sought companies that could make a deal, among them . However, nothing ever came of this, and DISH decided to enter the country itself. According to the Brazilian Agency of Telecommunications (Anatel), they awaited the authorization of the application. In June 2019, nonetheless, DISH TV accepted to resign its satellite exploration rights assigned to EchoStar and thus ending the possibility of entering the Brazilian market.

In January 2015, the company launched a subsidiary, Sling TV—an IPTV service distributed as an over-the-top media service.

In 2019, EchoStar transferred the portion of its business which managed and provided broadcast satellite services, referred to as the BSS (Broadcast Satellite Services) business, to DISH to concentrate on broadband services and other initiatives.

==== Wireless ====

In 2019, as part of the merger of Sprint Corporation and T-Mobile US, DISH reached an agreement to acquire Sprint&#x27;s prepaid wireless businesses, including Boost Mobile, in order to quell antitrust concerns. After the merger was approved by the Justice Department, DISH stated that it intended to supplant Sprint as a fourth major national wireless carrier, and had committed to building out a 5G network serving at least 70% of the U.S. population by June 2023. As part of the agreement, DISH would receive access to the T-Mobile network for seven years while it builds out its 5G-specific network. The $1.4 billion sale was completed on July 1, 2020. 

With this purchase it officially launched its wireless business, DISH Wireless, offering prepaid service through the Boost brand as an MVNO on the T-Mobile network. DISH stated intentions to offer branded postpaid service in the future with the build-out of their own network.

DISH purchased Ting Mobile from Tucows on August 1, 2020, Republic Wireless on March 8, 2021, and Gen Mobile on September 1, 2021. On July 19, 2021, DISH announced a 10-year, non-exclusive agreement with AT&amp;T Mobility for 4G and 5G roaming on its network, accompanying the existing T-Mobile agreement. The $5 billion deal also includes sharing of DISH wireless spectrum with AT&amp;T.

In May 2022, DISH Wireless began to launch its self-developed 5G network, codenamed &quot;Project Genesis&quot;, in Las Vegas; the company stated that it planned to serve at least 120 cities by the June 2023 deadline. In June 2022, DISH announced it had met a milestone requiring it to provide coverage to 20% of the U.S. population by June 2022. In December 2022, DISH Wireless launched a postpaid service under the spin-off brand Boost Infinite. In June 2023, the company announced that it had met the requirement to provide coverage to 70% of the U.S. population by June 14, 2023.

==== EchoStar merger ====
In August 2023, EchoStar announced that it would acquire DISH Network in an all-stock purchase, undoing their previous split. The acquisition, which was completed December 31, 2023, was part of an effort to bolster the company&#x27;s wireless business, with Ergen stating that it would allow them to offer &quot;an enhanced consumer connectivity business&quot;. As Ergen already held 90% of the voting stock in both companies, the FCC considered the &quot;acquisition&quot; to be a reorganization of assets with no change in effective control.

In July 2024, amid declines in subscribers, Boost Mobile underwent a relaunch with an updated brand identity, and Boost Infinite merged into the Boost Mobile business as part of a new plan lineup. EchoStar began referring to its 5G wireless network as the &quot;Boost Mobile Network&quot; and discontinued its usage of the DISH Wireless brand.

==== Proposed acquisition by DirecTV ====
On September 30, 2024, DirecTV announced its intent to acquire DISH Network, under an arrangement under which TPG Inc. will acquire the remaining stake of DirecTV it does not already own from AT&amp;T, and then acquire DISH Network&#x27;s video business from Echostar for $1 while assuming its net debt. The combined company would have had a total of approximately 20 million television subscribers. DirecTV stated that it had no plans for any changes to the DISH or SlingTV services following the purchase. The sale comes amid declines in both services&#x27; customer bases amid cord-cutting and other factors. EchoStar CEO Hamid Akhavan stated that the agreement would allow the company to place a larger focus on expanding its wireless Boost Mobile network. In November, DirecTV abandoned the deal due to opposition from EchoStar&#x27;s bondholders.

==Criticism and legal issues==

DISH and its subsidiaries have faced legal action for some of its questionable practices, including fines for telemarketing tactics such as failure to disclose fees with full transparency. In 2012, DISH and a group of the United States&#x27; major television networks filed lawsuits over &quot;AutoHop&quot;, a feature in its recently-released Hopper set-top boxes that allowed users to detect and automatically skip commercials in their recordings. DISH later reached agreements with ABC, CBS, and Fox, under which it agreed to disable the feature for a certain window of time after a program&#x27;s first airing.

In 2023 DISH was fined $150,000 by the FCC for failing to de-orbit its EchoStar VII satellite according to the terms of its license; this was the first fine ever issued to a company over the matter of &quot;space debris&quot;.

===Removal of regional sports programming===
Dish Network has always refused to carry some of the higher-priced regional sports networks, most notably AT&amp;T SportsNet Southwest, YES Network, and Spectrum SportsNet, which have never been available on Dish. The contract of the entire MSG Network had ended on October 1, 2010, early; CSN New England was dropped on August 6, 2014. In July 2019, Dish removed the entire slate of Fox Sports Networks channels (which have since been twice re-branded first as Bally Sports and then FanDuel Sports Network). This was the beginning of a trend with Altitude being removed in August and NBC Sports Chicago in October of that year. On April 1, 2021, Dish removed the remaining NBC Sports Regional Networks and the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network. Dish Network president Brian Neylon commented that &quot;The current RSN model is fundamentally broken,” stating that he was in favor of offering the networks as an a la carte service. Six months later on October 1, 2021, Dish removed the entire AT&amp;T SportsNet network of channels. In 2022, Dish, alongside Sling made The Walt Disney Company pull their programming from the services. This was only temporary, as they got brought back later. They had previously been pulled from YouTube TV in 2021, and were pulled from Spectrum for ten days in early-September 2023.

The last remaining regional sports network, NESN, was removed from DISH on December 20, 2021.

===2023 ransomware attack===
In February 2023, Dish Network suffered a major ransomware attack which resulted in internal outages, loss of service at subsidiary companies such as Boost Mobile, and data theft. The company had to retain outside experts to resolve the issue, and the news caused a slide in the company&#x27;s share price to a 14-year-low. Service outages lasted for more than a month, with customers reporting wait times for customer service stretching to more than 14 hours. In the aftermath of the ransomware attack, Dish Network was criticized for lack of transparency or communication with its customers.

== Services and devices ==
DISH&#x27;s main service is satellite television and its offerings are comparable to other satellite and cable companies. Viewers can choose from a series of service bundles, paying more money for more channels. A la carte programming is available, however limited to premium channels such as HBO or Showtime. The company is currently working on diversifying its offerings. With its purchase of Blockbuster LLC, DISH owns the Blockbuster trademarks and has used its intellectual property agreement to offer streaming and mail-order video services.

===DishNET===

On September 27, 2012, DISH Network announced a satellite broadband service called DishNET, aimed at rural areas where cable is often not available.

===OnTech Smart Services===
DISH launched the direct-to-consumer smart home technology brand OnTech Smart Services in 2019; initially available in 11 metropolitan areas, the brand offers smart home devices and installation services.

===Blockchain and cryptocurrency===
DISH has been described as the first large company to accept cryptocurrency and being “comfortable with cryptocurrency”. The company has accepted Bitcoin since 2014. Four years later it began accepting Bitcoin Cash. In September 2021, it announced a partnership with Input Output Global (formerly known as IOHK) to build subscription services based on the Cardano blockchain. The following month it set up a system to expand 5G mobile network through customers using the Citizens Broadband Radio Service with rewards paid in cryptocurrency.

=== Charitable causes ===

DISH Cares was launched in 2014 and focuses on community engagement, sustainability, and providing services following disasters. The company has engaged in disaster relief efforts, including after Hurricanes Katrina, Harvey, Irma, and Maria.

== Technical information ==
Both a standard receiver and a receiver with built-in digital video recorder (DVR) were available to subscribers. The DISH Network ViP722 HD DVR replacement for the ViP622 received generally positive reviews. It could record up to 350 hours of standard-definition (SD) broadcasts, or 55 hours of high-definition (HD). These set-top boxes (STBs) allow for HD on the primary TV and SD on the secondary TV (TV2) without a secondary box on TV2.

=== Receivers and devices ===
==== Earlier satellite dishes ====
DISH Network&#x27;s first satellite antenna was simply called the &quot;DISH Network&quot; dish. It was retroactively named the &quot;DISH 300&quot; when legal and satellite problems forced delays of the forthcoming DISH 500 systems. It uses one LNB to obtain signals from the 119°W orbital location, and was commonly used as a second dish to receive additional high-definition or international programming from either the 148°W or 61.5°W orbital locations. The 119°W slot is one of two primary orbital locations, the other being 110°W, that provide core services.

==== Tailgater ====
The Tailgater is a portable satellite antenna; the tailgater can be purchased as a standalone device for $350. The Tailgater is compatible with the Wally and VIP211 receivers. Customers only need to pay for the period of time where the receiver is active on the account, the monthly cost for a Vip211 or Wally is $7 per month, if the receiver is the only one on the account, there is no charge. It weighs ten pounds, is protected from weather, and automatically searches for a signal. The only satellites that are currently compatible with the Tailgater are at DISH&#x27;s 119 (SD/HD TV), 110 (SD/HD TV), and 129 (SD/HD TV) orbital slots.

==== Hopper and Joey ====
Hopper is a line of multi-tuner set-top boxes first introduced in 2012; they are digital video recorders that can be networked with accompanying &quot;Joey&quot; set-top boxes for multi-room access to recordings. DISH Network subsequently introduced updated versions of the Hopper, including Hopper with Sling (which adds integrated placeshifting capabilities), the Hopper 3, and the Hopper Plus which features 4K support and 16 tuners. Hopper supports a voice-activated remote, as well as Amazon Echo and Google Home integration.

=== Apps ===
DISH Anywhere

DISH Anywhere is DISH&#x27;s subscriber-only streaming video service. The DISH Anywhere app combines Sling broadcast technology and internet to bring subscribers DISH content wherever they are. It also pairs with DISH On Demand, a library that has over 80,000 movies and shows.

As of late 2018, HBO and Cinemax were no longer available for DISH customers due to Contract disputes. However, Dish returned HBO and Cinemax programming as of August 2021.

==== Sling TV ====
In May 2012, DISH launched DISHWorld, a subscription-based over-the-top streaming IPTV service, as an app on Roku devices, offering access to over 50 international television channels via broadband streaming.

In 2014, DISH Network began to reach carriage deals with broadcasters for a new over-the-top service that would be aimed towards cord cutters as a low-cost alternative to traditional pay television. On January 5, 2015, DISH Network officially unveiled Sling TV, an over-the-top IPTV service designed to complement subscription video on-demand services such as Hulu and Netflix.

Some broadcasters have been hesitant about over-the-top services such as Sling TV, showing concern that they may undermine their carriage deals with larger conventional cable, satellite and Internet TV providers. Time Warner initially noted that the carriage of its channels on the service was only for a &quot;trial&quot; basis, while both Time Warner&#x27;s CEO Jeffrey Bewkes and an analyst from the firm Macquarie Capital disclosed that current contract language in DISH&#x27;s OTT carriage deals with the service&#x27;s content distributors would cap the number of subscribers that the service is allowed to have at any given time to 5 million. Neither DISH Network or its content providers have confirmed any such cap. As of January 2022, the service has reached 2.49 million subscribers.

=== Satellite fleet ===
Until 2019, most of the satellites used by DISH Network were owned and operated by EchoStar Corporation. DISH frequently moves satellites among its many orbiting slots so this list may not be accurate. Refer to Lyngsat and DISH Channel Chart for detailed satellite information.

<doc id="77786" wikidata="Q306639" url="?curid=77786" title="Ku band">
<text>The Ku band () is the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum in the microwave range of frequencies from 12 to 18 gigahertz (GHz). The symbol is short for &quot;K-under&quot; (originally ), because it is the lower part of the original NATO K band, which was split into three bands (Ku, K, and Ka) because of the presence of the atmospheric water vapor resonance peak at 22.24 GHz, (1.35 cm) which made the center unusable for long range transmission. In radar applications, it ranges from 12 to 18 GHz according to the formal definition of radar frequency band nomenclature in IEEE Standard 521–2002.

Ku band is primarily used for satellite communications, most notably the downlink used by direct broadcast satellites to broadcast satellite television, and for specific applications such as NASA&#x27;s Tracking Data Relay Satellite used for International Space Station (ISS) communications and SpaceX Starlink satellites. Ku band satellites are also used for backhauls and particularly for satellite from remote locations back to a television network&#x27;s studio for editing and broadcasting. The band is split by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) into multiple segments that vary by geographical region. NBC was the first television network to uplink a majority of its affiliate feeds via Ku band in 1983.

Some frequencies in this radio band are employed in radar guns used by law enforcement to detect vehicles speeding, especially in Europe.

==Segments and regions==
===America===
Segments in most of North and South America are represented by ITU Region 2 from 11.7 to 12.2 GHz (Local Oscillator Frequency (LOF) 10.75 to 11.25 GHz), allocated to the FSS (fixed satellite service), uplink from 14.0 to 14.5 GHz. There are more than 22 FSS Ku band satellites orbiting over North America, each carrying 12 to 48 transponders, 20 to 120 watts per transponder, and requiring a 0.8-m to 1.5-m antenna for clear reception.

The 12.2 to 12.7 GHz (LOF 11.25 to 11.75 GHz) segment is allocated to the BSS (broadcasting satellite service). BSS (DBS direct broadcast satellites) normally carry 16 to 32 transponders of 27 MHz bandwidth running at 100 to 240 watts of power, allowing the use of receiver antennas as small as 18 inches (450 mm).

===Europe and Africa===
Segments in those regions are represented by ITU Region 1, and they are the 11.45 to 11.7 and 12.5 to 12.75 GHz bands are allocated to the FSS (fixed satellite service, uplink 14.0 to 14.5 GHz). In Europe Ku band is used from 10.7 to 12.75 GHz (LOF Low 9.75 GHz, LOF High 10.6 GHz) for direct broadcast satellite services such as those carried by the Astra satellites. The 11.7 to 12.5 GHz segment is allocated to the BSS (broadcasting satellite service).

===Australia===
Australia is part of ITU Region 3 and the Australian regulatory environment provides a class license that covers downlinking from 11.70 GHz to 12.75 GHz and uplinking from 14.0 GHz to 14.5 GHz.

===Indonesia===
The ITU has categorized Indonesia as Region P, countries with very high rain precipitation. This statement has made many people unsure about using Ku-band (11 – 18 GHz) in Indonesia. Using frequencies higher than 10 GHz in a heavy rain area usually gives poor results. This problem can be solved by using an appropriate link budget when designing the wireless communication link. Higher power can overcome the loss to rain fade.

Measurements of rain attenuation in Indonesia have been done for satellite communication links in Padang, Cibinong, Surabaya and Bandung. The DAH Model for rain attenuation prediction is valid for Indonesia, as is the ITU model. The DAH model has become an ITU recommendation since 2001 (Recommendation No. ITU-R P.618-7). This model can create a 99.7% available link so that Ku-band can be applied in Indonesia.

Use of the Ku-band for satellite communications in tropical regions like Indonesia is becoming more frequent. Several satellites above Indonesia have Ku-band transponders, and even Ka band transponders. NSS 6, launched in December 2002 and positioned at 95° East, contains only Ku-band transponders with a footprint on Indonesia (Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Celebes, Bali, Nusa Tenggara, Moluccas). NSS 6 is intended to be replaced by SES-12 at the same location, which launched in June 2018 and carries 54 Ku-band transponders. The IPSTAR 1 satellite, launched in 2004 also uses Ku band footprints. Other satellites that provides Ku band covers Indonesia are MEASAT-3b, JCSAT-4B, AsiaSat 5, ST-2, Chinasat 11, Koreasat 8/ABS-2, SES-8, Telkom-3S, and Nusantara Satu.

===Others===
Other ITU allocations have been made within the Ku band to the fixed service (microwave towers), radio astronomy service, space research service, mobile service, mobile satellite service, radiolocation service (radar), amateur radio service, and radionavigation. However, not all of these services are actually operating in this band and others are only minor users.

==Advantages==
Compared with C-band, Ku band is not similarly restricted in power to avoid interference with terrestrial microwave systems, and the power of its uplinks and downlinks can be increased. This higher power also translates into smaller receiving dishes and points out a generalization between a satellite&#x27;s transmission and a dish&#x27;s size. As the power increases, the size of an antenna&#x27;s dish will decrease. This is because the purpose of the dish element of the antenna is to collect the incident waves over an area and focus them all onto the antenna&#x27;s actual receiving element, mounted in front of the dish (and pointed back towards its face); if the waves are more intense, fewer of them need to be collected to achieve the same intensity at the receiving element.

A major attraction of the band over lower frequency microwave bands is that the shorter wavelengths allow sufficient angular resolution to separate the signals of different communication satellites to be achieved with smaller terrestrial parabolic antennas. From the Rayleigh criterion, the diameter of a parabolic dish required to create a radiation pattern with a given angular beamwidth (gain) is proportional to the wavelength, and thus inversely proportional to the frequency. At 12 GHz a 1-meter dish is capable of focusing on one satellite while sufficiently rejecting the signal from another satellite only 2 degrees away. This is important because satellites in FSS (Fixed Satellite Service) service (11.7-12.2 GHz in the U.S.) are only 2 degrees apart. At 4 GHz (C-band) a 3-meter dish is required to achieve this narrow angular resolution. Note the inverse linear correlation between dish size and frequency. For Ku satellites in DBS (Direct Broadcast Satellite) service (12.2-12.7 GHz in the U.S.) dishes much smaller than 1-meter can be used because those satellites are spaced 9 degrees apart. As power levels on both C and Ku band satellites have increased over the years, dish beam-width has become much more critical than gain.

The Ku band also offers a user more flexibility. A smaller dish size and a Ku band system&#x27;s freedom from terrestrial operations simplifies finding a suitable dish site. For the end users Ku band is generally cheaper and enables smaller antennas (both because of the higher frequency and a more focused beam). Ku band is also less vulnerable to rain fade than the Ka band frequency spectrum.

==Disadvantages==
There are, however, some disadvantages of the Ku band system. Around 10 GHz is the absorption peak due to orientation relaxation of molecules in liquid water. Above 10 GHz, Mie scattering takes over. The effect is a noticeable degradation, commonly known as rain fade, during heavy rain (100 mm/h). This problem can be mitigated by transmitting a higher powered signal from the satellite to compensate. Therefore, the Ku band satellites typically require considerably more power to transmit than the C-band satellites.

Another weather-caused degradation called &quot;snow fade&quot; is not specific to the Ku band. It is due to snow or ice accumulation on a dish significantly altering its focal point.

The satellite operator&#x27;s Earth station antenna requires more accurate position control when operating at Ku band due to its much narrower beam focus compared to C band for a dish of a given size. Position feedback accuracies are higher and the antenna may require a closed loop control system to maintain position under wind loading of the dish surface.

<text>Juan Antonio Samaranch y Torelló, 1st Marquess of Samaranch (Catalan: &quot;Joan Antoni Samaranch i Torelló&quot;, ; 17 July 1920 – 21 April 2010) was a Catalan sports administrator under the Franco regime (1973–1977) who served as the seventh president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) from 1980 to 2001.

==Life==
Juan Antonio Samaranch was born on 17 July 1920 in Barcelona as the third of six children in a wealthy Catalan family. In 1938, during the Spanish Civil War, he was conscripted to serve as a medical assistant in the Spanish Republican Armed Forces. Samaranch&#x27;s political sympathies were for the Nationalists, and he deserted to Nationalist-held territory by way of France. On 1 December 1955, he married Maria Teresa Salisachs Rowe. With Salisachs Rowe, he had two children: Juan Antonio Junior, currently a member of the International Olympic Committee, and Maria Teresa.

Samaranch started his studies at the Business School of Barcelona, which he completed in London and the US, and obtained a diploma from the Barcelona Higher Institute of Business Studies (IESE). During his studies, he practised roller hockey, for which he created World Championships in 1951 and which the Spanish team won.

A member of the Falange in Francoist Spain, Samaranch held various political positions in municipal and national government: he became a city councilor for the city of Barcelona responsible for sport in 1954, then delegate for physical education and sport in the Spanish Parliament in 1967. Samaranch was appointed president of the provincial council of Barcelona in 1973, until he resigned four years later, when he was appointed Spanish Ambassador to the Soviet Union and Mongolia after the resumption of diplomatic relations between the two countries.

Maintaining an active career within the Olympic Movement, Samaranch was elected vice-president of the International Mediterranean Games Committee for the second edition of the Games in Barcelona in 1955. On several occasions, he was appointed Chef de Mission: for the Winter Games in Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo (1956), the Summer Games in Rome (1960), and the Summer Games in Tokyo (1964). For the Rome and Tokyo Games, he was also president of the Spanish delegation. Elected a member of the Spanish Olympic Committee in 1956, he became its president in 1967 until 1970. He was elected as an IOC member in 1966. Two years later, Avery Brundage appointed him head of protocol (1968–1975 and 1979–1980). A member of the executive board (1970–1978 and 1979–1980), he was IOC vice-president from 1974 to 1978. Elected to the IOC presidency in the first round of voting on 16 July 1980 at the 83rd Session, he succeeded Lord Killanin on 3 August that year.

Samaranch acceded to the IOC presidency during the troubled political period of the Games of the XXII Olympiad in Moscow. He sought to defend the Olympic movement and raise its profile on his numerous trips and meetings with heads of state and sports leaders. In 1981, he obtained for the IOC the status of non-governmental international organisation and became the first IOC President, after Pierre de Coubertin, to establish himself in Lausanne. He was also in favour of the integration of women into the Olympic Movement, and during the Baden-Baden Congress gained permission for women to become members of the IOC. At his instigation, the IOC became involved in various initiatives to promote women and sport.

Samaranch managed to include both the NOC of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and that of Chinese Taipei; with the assistance of Kéba Mbaye, he contributed to the reintegration of South Africa into the Olympics after the abolition of apartheid; he visited Sarajevo during the civil war to express Olympic solidarity; and the two Koreas marched under the same flag at the opening ceremony in Sydney.

For sport, he intensified the IOC&#x27;s support to organise Paralympic Games as from the Winter Games in Sarajevo in 1984. He also made doping a priority issue by launching research and control programmes. The creation of the World Anti-Doping Agency in 1999 allowed the IOC Medical Commission to extend its scope of action. He also full opening of the Olympic Games to the best athletes regardless of their status. Finally, it was under his presidency that the Summer and Winter Games were organised two years apart, instead of in the same year.

Among the reforms to the running of the IOC, he imposed a new financial policy which allowed for the increase in revenues and the diversification of resources. Thanks to a large share of the revenues generated by agreements with TV channels, he restructured Olympic Solidarity in 1981 and provided assistance to National Olympic Committees in difficulty, and developed action plans to contribute to the universality of the Games.

In 1991 he received the title of Marqués from the King of Spain for his involvement in the Olympic Movement. On 23 June 1993, the inauguration of the Olympic Museum, representing the memory and spirit of modern Olympism, the work of his career, crowned his presidency. On 16 July 2001, he left the seat of the IOC presidency to Jacques Rogge. Samaranch became Honorary Life President of the IOC and was awarded the Gold Olympic Order upon standing down from the presidency. The IOC also voted to change the name of the Olympic Museum to the Samaranch Museum.

Samaranch was a devout Catholic and was a supernumerary (lay member) of Opus Dei.

He died on 21 April 2010 at the age of 89, in Barcelona.

==Business and political career==

After actively participating in the Spanish Civil War, Samaranch studied commerce at IESE Business School in Barcelona. He had a short career as a sports journalist for &quot;La Prensa&quot;, which ended in his dismissal in 1943 for criticising the supporters of Real Madrid C.F. after that club&#x27;s 11–1 defeat of FC Barcelona, and then joined his family&#x27;s textile business. He joined the board of La Caixa, Spain&#x27;s largest savings bank, in 1984, and served as president of the board from 1987 to 1999. He remained as honorary president from his retirement in 1999 to his death.

Samaranch served on the municipal government of Barcelona, with responsibility for sports, from 1955 to 1962. He was a &quot;procurador&quot; (member of the lower house) of the Cortes Españolas during the last decade of the Franco regime, from 1964 until the restoration of democracy in 1977. From 1967 to 1971, he also served as &quot;national delegate&quot; (minister) for sports, and from 1973 to 1977 he was the president of the &quot;diputación&quot; (governing council) of the Province of Barcelona. He was appointed Spanish ambassador to the Soviet Union and Mongolia in 1977, immediately after the restoration of diplomatic relations between the countries: this post helped him to gain the support of the Soviet bloc countries in the election to the presidency of the IOC, held in Moscow in 1980.

He had been the &quot;chef de mission&quot; of the Spanish team at a number of Olympic events, before he was appointed Government Secretary for Sports by Spanish Head of State Francisco Franco in 1967. He also became the president of the Spanish National Olympic Committee and a member of the IOC. He was vice-president of the IOC from 1974 to 1978.

==IOC Presidency==

Samaranch became President elect in 1980 at the 83rd IOC Session (15–18 July) which was held in Moscow prior to the 1980 Summer Olympics—and took office soon after the Games.

During his term, Samaranch oversaw the Olympic Games returned to financial health, with big television deals and sponsorships established through the efforts of Dick Pound, President of the Canadian Olympic Committee. Although the 1984 Summer Olympics were still boycotted by the Soviet bloc, 140 National Olympic Committees took part in those Games, a record number at the time. and the number of participating member nations increased at every Games during Samaranch&#x27;s presidency. Samaranch also wanted the best athletes to compete in the Olympics, which led to the gradual acceptance of professional athletes as opposed to amateurs or state-funded athletes, as was the case with the Soviet Union.

He was awarded the 1990 Seoul Peace Prize.

It became a tradition for Samaranch, when giving the president&#x27;s address at the close of each Summer Olympics, to praise the organisers at each Olympiad for putting on &quot;the best ever&quot; Games.

In 2001, Samaranch did not apply for the presidency again. He was succeeded by Jacques Rogge. He then became honorary president for life of the International Olympic Committee. Samaranch served the second-longest term as the head of the IOC, 21 years, the longest being that of Pierre de Coubertin (29 years). Following his retirement, Samaranch played a major role in Madrid&#x27;s bid for the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, though both were unsuccessful. In 1991, he was raised into the Spanish nobility by King Juan Carlos of Spain and given the hereditary title of &quot;Marqués de Samaranch&quot; (&quot;Marquess of Samaranch&quot;), this in recognition of his contribution to the Olympic movement.

==Family==
Samaranch married María Teresa Salisachs Rowe, known as &quot;Bibí&quot; (26 December 193116 September 2000), on 1 December 1955. She died in Spain while he was attending the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. Two children were born of this marriage: his elder child and daughter, María Teresa Samaranch Salisachs (born 1956), has been president of the Spanish Federation of Sports on Ice since 2005, while his younger child and son, Juan Antonio Samaranch Salisachs (born 1959), has been a member of the International Olympic Committee since 2001.

==Death and legacy==

Samaranch died of cardio-respiratory failure in the Hospital Quirón in Barcelona on 21 April 2010, having suffered ill health for several years prior.

As a recipient of the Gold Medal of the Generalitat de Catalunya, Samaranch was laid-in-state in the Palau de la Generalitat. His funeral mass was held in the Cathedral of Santa Eulalia, on 22 April 2010 and was attended by representatives of the Spanish royal family and of the Olympic movement. He was buried at the Montjuïc Cemetery. After his death, in June 2010, the Juan Antonio Samaranch Olympic and Sport Museum and the Olympic Hall Juan Antonio Samaranch, formerly Olympic Hall Zetra, in Sarajevo, Bosnia, were renamed in his honour.

<text>Alberto Aleandro Uderzo (; 25 April 1927 – 24 March 2020), better known as Albert Uderzo (), was a French comic book artist and scriptwriter. He is best known as the co-creator and illustrator of the &quot;Astérix&quot; series in collaboration with René Goscinny. He also drew other comics such as &quot;Oumpah-pah&quot;, again with Goscinny.
Uderzo retired in September 2011.

==Early life==
Uderzo was born in Fismes in the Marne department of France on 25 April 1927 as the fourth child of Italian immigrants Silvio Uderzo (1888–1985), a carpenter, and his wife Iria Uderzo (, 1897–1997). His parents had met in 1915 in La Spezia, where Silvio Uderzo was recovering after being wounded while serving in the Royal Italian Army during World War I. Uderzo&#x27;s mother, Iria Crestini, was working in the arsenals of La Spezia, along with many young Italian women at the time. Silvio was discharged from military service after the war, on 19 June 1919. The two became a couple and married shortly before the birth of their first child, Bruno (1920–2004). After Bruno, they had Rina in 1922. They moved from Italy to France with their then two children, first settling in Chauny in the Aisne departement. They changed location regularly. In Chauny, a son named Albert was born in 1925 but died of pneumonia at the age of 8 months. The Uderzos decided to name their next son in honor of the late brother. The name &quot;Albert&quot;, that of the deceased brother, became the Italian &quot;Alberto&quot; because the registrar misunderstood Silvio Uderzo&#x27;s heavy Italian accent. The name &quot;Aleandro&quot; is in honor of Uderzo&#x27;s paternal grandfather.
Uderzo was born on the morning of 25 April 1927 around 07:00. At this point, he was an Italian citizen rather than a French one. Uderzo was born with six fingers on each hand. The additional fingers were surgically removed early in childhood as a precaution, as the infant Uderzo would sometimes violently pull on them when enraged or annoyed.

In 1929, the Uderzos moved to Clichy-sous-Bois in the eastern suburbs of Paris, the capital city of France. Here, Uderzo experienced elements of xenophobia against Italian immigrants during his childhood, even though he gained French citizenship in the year 1934. Clichy-sous-Bois, at the time a very politically left-leaning political district, held deep popular sentiments against Mussolini&#x27;s dictatorship and its involvement in the Spanish Civil War. Uderzo at one particular point became the target of the anger of a victim of Italian-German bombardment in the Spanish Civil War, and said a man spat in his face. However, apart from the occasional ethnic resentment against Italians, Uderzo viewed his childhood and education in Clichy-sous-Bois fondly in retrospect. His mother gave birth to two more children: Jeanne was born in 1932 and Marcel in 1933.

Uderzo came in touch with the arts for the first time during kindergarten, where he was noted as talented for his age. Most of his siblings also shared certain artistic talents, and their mother used sheets of paper and pencils to give the children, especially her oldest son Bruno, something to do. Bruno became an inspiration for Albert and in turn, soon noted the younger brother&#x27;s talent. At this point, Albert did not yet aim to become a professional artist later in life and instead dreamt about a career as a clown and, after dropping that aspiration, aimed to follow Bruno into the craft of aircraft engineering. At the same time, he came in contact with the American comic and animated cartoon cultures, particularly with the early works of Walt Disney like Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. The family moved to the Rue de Montreuil in the 11th arrondissement of Paris in October 1938, changing both schools and the social vicinity. Although Albert, now with a Parisian accent, was no longer easily recognized as of Italian heritage, he nonetheless had problems in school. His only successful area in his educational pursuits was sketching and the arts. It would take him until around the age of 11 or 12 to go from sketching to painting in colors, however, which was when his parents discovered that Uderzo was color blind. From then on, Uderzo would use labels on his colors, but as he mostly stuck with black-and-white sketching, it would not make a huge impact on his artistic career either way.

In September 1939, Germany invaded Poland and France declared war on Germany in response. Albert&#x27;s father Silvio, by then 51, was too old to be conscripted into the French army, whereas Albert himself was too young at 12. Bruno, however, was of military age and was called to action, which he survived without injury. Albert soon finished his basic education at the age of 13 and decided to follow Bruno into aircraft engineering.

==Working with Goscinny==

After working on various creations and travelling for the next few years, Uderzo met René Goscinny in 1951. The two men quickly became good friends, and decided to work together in 1952 at the newly opened Paris office of the Belgian company, World Press. Their first creations were the characters Oumpah-pah, Jehan Pistolet and Luc Junior. In 1958 they adapted &quot;Oumpah-pah&quot; for serial publication in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine &quot;Tintin&quot;, where it ran until 1962. In 1959 Goscinny and Uderzo became editor and artistic director (respectively) of &quot;Pilote&quot; magazine, a new venture aimed at older children. The magazine&#x27;s first issue introduced Astérix to the French world, and it was an instant hit. During this period Uderzo also collaborated with Jean-Michel Charlier on the realistic series &quot;Michel Tanguy&quot;, later named &quot;Les Aventures de Tanguy et Laverdure&quot;.

Astérix was serialised in &quot;Pilote&quot;, and in 1961 the first story &quot;Astérix le Gaulois (Asterix the Gaul)&quot; was published as an individual album. New Astérix albums were regularly published by the duo over the next sixteen years, until Goscinny’s sudden death in 1977. Thereafter Uderzo continued to write and illustrate the books on his own, published by his own publishing house &quot;Albert René&quot;, though at a significantly slower pace (averaging one edition every three to five years compared to two editions a year when working with Goscinny).

==Family==
Uderzo married Ada Milani in 1953 and had one daughter Sylvie Uderzo (b. 1956).

After Uderzo fired Sylvie and her husband in 2007 as managers of his estate and agreed to sell his share of Éditions Albert René to Hachette Livre, Sylvie accused him in a column in &quot;Le Monde&quot;, that with this sale to a corporation it was &quot;as if the gates of the Gaulish village had been thrown open to the Roman Empire&quot;. Uderzo had previously stated in interviews that Asterix would end with his death; however, the terms of the sale to Hachette allowed the company to continue producing Asterix titles indefinitely with or without Uderzo&#x27;s participation. Uderzo in 2013 sued his daughter and son-in-law for &quot;psychological violence&quot;. Sylvie responded with a lawsuit claiming persons unnamed had abused her father&#x27;s &quot;frailty&quot;. Her case was thrown out of court in 2014 and the two reached an amicable settlement.

Upon Uderzo&#x27;s retirement in 2011, Asterix was taken over by Jean-Yves Ferri (script) and Didier Conrad (art).

Sylvie owned 40% of Éditions Albert René before selling her parts to Hachette. The publishing group now owns 100%, after the remaining 60%, previously owned by Uderzo and by Goscinny&#x27;s daughter, were also sold to Hachette Livre.

Uderzo&#x27;s brother, Marcel, was also a cartoonist. Marcel Uderzo worked with his brother Albert for the drawing and coloring of about twelve Asterix albums.

==Death==
On 24 March 2020, Uderzo died in his sleep at his home in Neuilly-sur-Seine, after suffering a heart attack, at the age of 92. His son-in-law Bernard de Choisy said the heart attack was not linked to COVID-19, and that Uderzo had felt very tired for several weeks prior to his death.

==Awards==
* 1985: Awarded the Knight of the Legion of Honour
* 1999: Grand Prix de la ville d&#x27;Angoulême, special prize for the millennium

* 2005: Inducted into the Eisner Award Hall of Fame, U.S.
* 2006: Awarded the Knight of the Order of the Netherlands Lion
* 2013: Awarded the Officer of the Legion of Honour

According to the UNESCO&#x27;s Index Translationum, Uderzo is the 10th most often translated French language author (Goscinny being 4th) and the third most often translated French language comics author behind René Goscinny and Hergé.

<text>Tibidabo () is a hill overlooking Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. At , it is the tallest hill in the Serra de Collserola. Rising sharply to the north-west, it has views over the city and the surrounding coastline.

The summit of the hill is occupied by the Sagrat Cor church and adjacent Tibidabo Amusement Park. The Torre de Collserola telecommunications tower is a short walk away. All three are prominently visible from most of the city of Barcelona. Designed by Enric Sagnier, the church was started in 1902 and took 60 years to complete. It is topped by a sculpture of the Sacred Heart of Jesus by Josep Miret Llopart.

Tibidabo can be reached by road or via the Tibidabo Funicular, which was the first of its kind in Spain, and by the Tramvia Blau. Funicular operations recommenced in June 2021 after modernisation, however the tramway remains out of service. Replacement bus TC2 connects Tibidabo with Avinguda de Tibidabo Metro station. The Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona minibus service 111 connects it to Vallvidrera village and the upper station of the Vallvidrera funicular.
==Origin of the name==
The name derives from the Latin Vulgate Bible verses:
* &quot;…et dixit illi haec tibi omnia dabo si cadens adoraveris me&quot; – &quot;And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me&quot; (Matthew 4:9);
* &quot;…et ait ei tibi dabo potestatem hanc universam et gloriam illorum quia mihi tradita sunt et cui volo do illa&quot; – &quot;All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it&quot; (Luke 4:6).

This phrase, meaning &quot;I will give to you&quot;, was said to Jesus by the devil as they looked down from an &quot;exceedingly high mountain&quot; upon &quot;all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them&quot;. The name of Barcelona&#x27;s hill thus refers to the popular tradition that it was in fact the &quot;exceedingly high mountain&quot; itself. The phrase &quot;Tibi dabo&quot; forms part of the inscription in the central dome of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Vatican City, although in that case it was drawn from Jesus&#x27; words to St. Peter in Matthew 16:19.

<text>Vallvidrera () is a neighbourhood of the Sarrià-Sant Gervasi district of Barcelona, Spain. It is situated in one of the sides of the Collserola hills, considered to be the lungs of the city due to the abundant forests it has. This wealthy neighbourhood has excellent views of the whole city, from some specific places and in a clear day it is possible to see Mallorca and the Pyrenees on the horizon. Although being a residential place it has important things such as, the Torre de Collserola (a communications tower designed by the architect Norman Foster), the Tibidabo Amusement Park and the Temple Expiatori del Sagrat Cor.

Vallvidrera used to be a cool summer retreat where wealthy people from Barcelona had their summer houses. Now the wealthy live in this neighbourhood all year round and have their summer retreats in further places inside Catalonia, such as the Costa Brava (for summer vacations) or Puigcerda (for winter vacations).

Vallvidrera can be reached by the Funicular de Vallvidrera, which connects at its lower station with the Metro del Vallès suburban railway with frequent services to the city center. The neighborhood is also served by minibus line 111, which connects to the upper station of the Vallvidrera funicular and the top of the Tibidabo hill. Other than the Funicular and the Bus, the most common type of transportation is the private one.

<text>ESPN (an initialism of their original name, which was the Entertainment and Sports Programming Network) is an American international basic cable sports channel owned by the Walt Disney Company (80% and operational control) and Hearst Communications (20%) through the joint venture ESPN Inc. The company was founded in 1979 by Bill Rasmussen, Scott Rasmussen and Ed Eagan.

ESPN broadcasts primarily from studio facilities located in Bristol, Connecticut. The network also operates offices and auxiliary studios in Miami, Orlando, New York City, Las Vegas, Seattle, Charlotte, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. James Pitaro has been chairman since March 5, 2018, following the resignation of John Skipper on December 18, 2017.

, ESPN is available to approximately 70 million pay television households in the United States—down from its 2011 peak of 100 million households. It operates regional channels in Africa, Australia, Latin America, and the Netherlands. In Canada, it owns a 20% interest in The Sports Network (TSN) and its five sister networks. Despite the network&#x27;s success, criticism of ESPN includes accusations of biased coverage.

==History==

===Background and Launch===
Bill Rasmussen came up with the concept of ESPN in May 1978, after he was fired from his job with the World Hockey Association&#x27;s New England Whalers. Rasmussen and his ESPN co-founder Ed Eagan, joined by Rasmussen&#x27;s son Scott (who had also been let go by the Whalers), first rented office space in Plainville, Connecticut. However, the plan to base ESPN there was put on hold because of a local ordinance prohibiting buildings from bearing rooftop satellite dishes. Available land to build their own facility on was quickly found in Bristol, Connecticut (where the channel remains headquartered to this day), with funding to buy the property provided by Getty Oil, which purchased 85% of the company from Bill Rasmussen on February 22, 1979, in an attempt to diversify the company&#x27;s holdings. This helped the credibility of the fledgling company; however, there were still many doubters about the viability of their sports channel concept. Another event that helped build ESPN&#x27;s credibility was securing an advertising agreement with Anheuser-Busch in the spring of 1979; the company invested $1 million to be the &quot;exclusive beer advertised on the network&quot;. 
ESPN launched on September 7, 1979, beginning with the first telecast of what would become the channel&#x27;s flagship program, &quot;SportsCenter&quot;. Taped in front of a small live audience inside the Bristol studios, it was broadcast to 1.4 million cable subscribers throughout the United States. One month after launch, Chris Berman joined the network; he would continue to be an on-air fixture for decades.

===1980s to 2000s===
ESPN&#x27;s next big step forward came when the channel acquired the rights to broadcast coverage of the early rounds of the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament. It first aired its games in March 1980, helping bring attention to what is today known as &quot;March Madness&quot;. The channel&#x27;s tournament coverage also launched the broadcasting career of Dick Vitale, who at the time he joined ESPN had just been fired as head coach of the Detroit Pistons.

In April of that year ESPN began televising the NFL Draft, bringing it also to a mass audience and over time creating a television &quot;event&quot;. That same month the network began broadcasting Top Rank Boxing on ESPN, marking the beginning of its involvement with televised professional boxing. The show lasted 16 years, and ESPN has since shown boxing live intermittently with other shows including ESPN Friday Night Fights and others. For a period during the 1980s, the network had boxing tournaments, crowning champions in different boxing weight divisions as &quot;ESPN champions&quot;.
The next major stepping stone for ESPN came throughout a couple of months in 1984. During this period, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) purchased 100% of ESPN from the Rasmussens and Getty Oil. Under Getty ownership, the channel was unable to compete for the television rights to major sports events contracts as its majority corporate parent would not provide the funding, leading ESPN to lose out for broadcast deals with the National Hockey League (to USA Network) and NCAA Division I college football (to TBS). For years, the NFL, NBA, and Major League Baseball refused to consider cable as a means of broadcasting some of their games. However, with the backing of ABC, ESPN&#x27;s ability to compete for major sports contracts greatly increased, and gave it credibility within the sports broadcasting industry.

Later that year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in &quot;NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma&quot; (1984) that the NCAA could no longer monopolize the rights to negotiate the contracts for college football games, allowing each school to negotiate broadcast deals on their own. ESPN took full advantage and began to broadcast a large number of NCAA football games, creating an opportunity for fans to be able to view multiple games each weekend (instead of just one), the same deal that the NCAA had previously negotiated with TBS. ESPN&#x27;s breakthrough moment occurred in 1987 when it secured a contract with the NFL to broadcast eight games during that year&#x27;s regular season – all of which aired on Sunday nights, marking the first broadcasts of Sunday NFL primetime games. ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; games would become the highest-rated NFL telecasts for the next 17 years (before losing the rights to NBC in 2006). The channel&#x27;s decision to broadcast NFL games on Sunday evenings resulted in a decline in viewership for the daytime games shown on the major broadcast networks, marking the first time that ESPN had been a legitimate competitor to NBC and CBS, which had long dominated the sports television market.

In 1992, ESPN launched ESPN Radio, a national sports talk radio network providing analysis and commentary programs (including shows such as &quot;Mike and Mike in the Morning&quot; and &quot;The Herd&quot;) as well as audio play-by-play of sporting events (including some simulcast with the ESPN television channel).

On October 10, 1993, ESPN2 – a secondary channel that originally was programmed with a separate lineup of niche sports popular with males 18–49 years old (with snowboarding and the World Series of Poker as its headliners) as well as serving as an overflow channel for ESPN – launched on cable systems reaching to 10 million subscribers. It became the fastest-growing cable channel in the U.S. during the 1990s, eventually expanding its national reach to 75 million subscribers.

Ownership of ABC, and thus control of ESPN, was acquired by Capital Cities Communications in 1985. ESPN&#x27;s parent company renamed themselves as Capital Cities/ABC Inc. Capital Cities/ABC Inc. was then acquired by the Walt Disney Company in 1996 and was re-branded as Walt Disney Television.

===2000s===
Challenges began to appear in the 2000s. ESPN began to shed viewers, more than 10 million over a period of several years in the 2010s even while paying large sums of money for the broadcast rights to properties like the NFL, NBA and College Football Playoff.

On April 26, 2017, approximately 100 ESPN employees were notified that their positions with the sports network had been terminated, among them athletes-turned-analysts Trent Dilfer and Danny Kanell, and noted journalists like NFL beat reporter Ed Werder and Major League Baseball expert Jayson Stark. Further cost-cutting measures taken included moving the studio operations of ESPNU to Bristol from Charlotte, North Carolina, reducing its longtime MLB studio show &quot;Baseball Tonight&quot; to Sundays as a lead-in to the primetime game and adding the MLB Network-produced &quot;Intentional Talk&quot; to ESPN2&#x27;s daily lineup.

On April 12, 2018, ESPN began a supplemental over-the-top streaming service known as ESPN+.

After having last carried national-televised NHL games in 2004, ESPN and ABC agreed in March 2021 on a seven-year contract to televise games, with some airing on ESPN+ and Hulu. The contract also awarded four of the seven Stanley Cup Finals to both ESPN and ABC. All other nationally televised games would air on TBS and TNT under a separate deal the league struck with Turner Sports the following month.

On August 8, 2023, ESPN and Penn Entertainment announced a deal to brand Penn&#x27;s sportsbooks with ESPN branding. Penn&#x27;s existing Barstool Sportsbook would be rebranded as ESPN Bet in fall 2023.

On February 6, 2024, ESPN announced a joint venture with Fox Sports and TNT Sports to offer Venu Sports, including the three organizations&#x27; main linear sports channels and associated media rights, planned to launch in fall 2024. The service was ultimately cancelled. Additionally, the company plans to launch a &quot;flagship&quot; standalone streaming offering, including the ESPN and ESPN2 linear channels, in late summer or fall 2025.

==Programming==

Alongside its live sports broadcasts, ESPN also airs a variety of sports highlight, talk, and documentary-styled shows. These include:
* &quot;Around the Horn&quot; – Competitive debating between four sports writers across the country
* &quot;College GameDay&quot; (basketball) – Weekly college basketball show airing from the &quot;Saturday Primetime&quot; game of the week site

* &quot;Monday Night Countdown&quot; – Weekly recap show aired on Monday evenings during the NFL season, also serves as the pre-game show for &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;
* &quot;Pardon the Interruption&quot; – A daily afternoon talk show where Tony Kornheiser and Michael Wilbon debate an array of sports topics
* &quot;SportsCenter&quot; – The flagship program of ESPN, a daily sports news program delivering the latest sports news and highlights
* &quot;Sunday NFL Countdown&quot; – Weekly preview show that airs on Sunday mornings during the NFL season
* &quot;The Pat McAfee Show&quot; – A daily afternoon talk show with news, opinion, and analysis

Many of ESPN&#x27;s documentary programs (such as &quot;30 for 30&quot; and &quot;Nine for IX&quot;) are produced by ESPN Films, a film division created in March 2008 as a restructuring of ESPN Original Entertainment, a programming division that was originally formed in 2001. 30 for 30 started airing in 2009 and continues airing to this day. Each episode is through the eyes of a well known filmmaker and has featured some of the biggest directors in Hollywood. The &quot;30 for 30&quot; film &quot;O.J.: Made in America&quot; won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 2017, the first such Oscar for ESPN.

Ultimate Fighting Championship signed a five-year contract with ESPN starting 2019 on ESPN and ESPN+ which estimate every quarter 2 event on UFC on ESPN and 6 events on UFC Fight Night on ESPN+.

In March 2019, ESPN announced a new betting-themed daily program, &quot;Daily Wager&quot;, hosted by the network&#x27;s gambling analyst Doug Kezirian. The program was ESPN&#x27;s first regularly scheduled program solely dedicated to gaming-related content. On May 14, 2019, ESPN announced a deal with casino operator Caesars Entertainment to establish an ESPN-branded studio at The LINQ Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas to produce betting-themed content.
In order to help offset the impact of COVID-19 on its business, Walt Disney CEO Bob Chapek indicated during a 4th quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings conference that the company would increase its presence in online sports betting, including in partnership with third parties.

In 2023, &quot;The Pat McAfee Show&quot; moved to ESPN as part of a five-year $85 million deal. The show replaced the Noon ET airing of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; and &quot;This Just In with Max Kellerman.&quot;

==Related channels==
===ESPN on ABC===

Since September 2006, ESPN has been integrated with the sports division of sister broadcast network ABC, with sports events televised on that network airing under the banner ESPN on ABC; much of ABC&#x27;s sports coverage since the rebranding has become increasingly limited to secondary coverage of sporting events whose broadcast rights are held by ESPN (such as NBA games, NHL games, and the X Games and its related qualifying events) as well as a limited array of events not broadcast on ESPN (most notably, the NBA Finals).

===ESPN2===

ESPN2 was launched on October 1, 1993. It carried a broad mix of event coverage from conventional sports—including auto racing, college basketball and NHL hockey—to extreme sports—such as BMX, skateboarding and motocross. The &quot;ESPN BottomLine&quot;, a ticker displaying sports news and scores during all programming that is now used by all of ESPN&#x27;s networks, originated on ESPN2 in 1995. In the late 1990s, ESPN2 was gradually reformatted to serve as a secondary outlet for ESPN&#x27;s mainstream sports programming.

===ESPNews===

ESPNews is a subscription television network that was launched on November 1, 1996, originally focusing solely on sports news, highlights, and press conferences. Since August 2010, the network has gradually incorporated encores of ESPN&#x27;s various sports debate and entertainment shows and video simulcasts of ESPN Radio shows, in addition to sports news programming. Since the 2013 cancellation of &quot;Highlight Express&quot;, programming consists mainly of rebroadcasts of &quot;SportsCenter&quot;. ESPNews also serves as an overflow feed due to programming conflicts caused by sporting events on the other ESPN networks.

===ESPN Deportes===

ESPN Deportes (, &quot;ESPN Sports&quot;) is a subscription television network that was originally launched in July 2001 to provide Spanish simulcasts of certain Major League Baseball telecasts from ESPN. It became a 24-hour sports channel in January 2004.

===ESPNU===

ESPNU is a subscription television network that launched on March 4, 2005, that focuses on college athletics including basketball, football, baseball, college swimming, and ice hockey.

===SEC Network===

SEC Network is a subscription television network that launched on August 14, 2014, focusing on the coverage of sporting events sanctioned by the Southeastern Conference.

===Other services===
;ESPN HD

ESPN launched its high definition simulcast feed, originally branded as ESPNHD, on March 30, 2003, with an Opening Day broadcast of the Texas Rangers and Anaheim Angels. All studio shows based in Bristol and at L. A. Live, along with most live event telecasts on ESPN, are broadcast in high definition. ESPN is one of the few television networks with an all-digital infrastructure. Archived non-HD programming is presented in 4:3 standard definition with stylized pillarboxing. &quot;Pardon the Interruption&quot; and &quot;Around the Horn&quot; began airing in HD on September 27, 2010, with the relocation of the production of both shows into the facility housing the Washington, D.C., bureau for ABC News.

ESPN broadcasts HD programming in the 720p resolution format, because ABC executives proposed a progressive scan signal that resolves fluid and high-speed motion in sports better, particularly during slow-motion replays. The network&#x27;s Digital Center itself natively holds 2160p UHD/4K operations and equipment. In 2011, ESPNHD began to downplay its distinct promotional logo in preparation for the conversion of its standard definition feed from a 4:3 full-screen to a letterboxed format (via the application of the AFD #10 display flag), which occurred on June 1 of that year.

; WatchESPN

WatchESPN was a website for desktop computers, as well as an application for smartphones and tablet computers that allowed subscribers of participating pay-TV providers to watch live streams of programming from ESPN and its sister networks (except for ESPN Classic), including most sporting events, on computers, mobile devices, Apple TV, Roku and Xbox Live via their TV Everywhere login provided by their cable provider. The service originally launched on October 25, 2010, as ESPN Networks, a streaming service that provided a live stream of ESPN exclusive to Time Warner Cable subscribers. ESPN3, an online streaming service providing live streams and replays of global sports events that launched in 2005 as a separate website, was incorporated into the WatchESPN platform on August 31, 2011. Likewise, ESPN+ was launched in April 2018 as an add-on subscription for $4.99 per month. On June 1, 2019, WatchESPN was discontinued with the service&#x27;s full merger into the ESPN app.

; ESPN Events

ESPN Regional Television (formerly branded as ESPN Plus) is the network&#x27;s syndication arm, which produces collegiate sporting events for free-to-air television stations throughout the United States (primarily those affiliated with networks such as The CW and MyNetworkTV or independent stations). ESPN Plus syndicates college football and basketball games from the American Athletic Conference, Big 12 Conference, Mid-American Conference, Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference, Sun Belt Conference and the Western Athletic Conference.

; ESPN on Snapchat

===Former services===
; ESPN Classic

ESPN Classic was a subscription television network that launched in 1995 as Classic Sports Network, founded by Brian Bedol and Steve Greenberg. ESPN Inc. purchased Classic Sports Network in 1997 for $175 million, rebranding the channel as &quot;ESPN Classic&quot; in 1998. The channel broadcast notable archived sporting events (originally including events from earlier decades, but later focusing mainly on events from the 1990s and later), as well as sports documentaries and sports-themed movies. It was discontinued on December 31, 2021.

;Longhorn Network

==ESPN Bet==

ESPN moved into the sports betting scene in November 2023 with plans to launch their sportsbook app &quot;ESPN Bet&quot; on November 14. In a partnership with Penn Entertainment, ESPN Bet began in 17 states. Once live, ESPN featured betting odds from their own sportsbook on their content.

==Criticism==

ESPN has been criticized for focusing too much on men&#x27;s college and professional sports (particularly the NBA and NFL), and very little on women&#x27;s sports or extreme sports. Baseball, ice hockey, and soccer fans have also criticized ESPN for not giving their respective sports more coverage. Other criticism has focused on ethnicity in ESPN&#x27;s varying mediated forms, as well as carriage fees and issues regarding the exportation of ESPN content. Some critics argue that ESPN&#x27;s success is their ability to provide other enterprise and investigative sports news while competing with other hard sports-news-producing outlets such as Yahoo! Sports and Fox Sports. Some scholars have challenged ESPN&#x27;s journalistic integrity, calling for an expanded standard of professionalism to prevent biased coverage and conflicts of interest.

On October 8, 2019, &quot;Deadspin&quot; reported that an internal memo was sent to ESPN employees instructing them to avoid any political discussions regarding the People&#x27;s Republic of China and Hong Kong in the aftermath of a tweet by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey.

ESPN has won 232 Sports Emmy Awards in 35 years of eligibility.
 In 2024, ESPN apologized for submitting fake names for Sports Emmy award consideration over many years, and returned 37 trophies that had been awarded to ineligible recipients to the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.

<text>Montjuïc () is a hill in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.

Montjuïc or Montjuich, meaning &quot;Jewish Mountain&quot; in medieval Latin and Catalan, is a broad, shallow hill in Barcelona with a rich history. It was the birthplace of the city, and its strategic location on the Mediterranean and the Llobregat River has made it significant throughout history. The hill has a medieval Jewish cemetery, declared an area of Cultural Asset of National Interest in 2007. Montjuïc has been the site of various fortifications, including the Castle of Montjuïc dating back to the 17th century. The area was also associated with political imprisonments and executions, and held significance during the Spanish Civil War.

The hill was chosen as the site for the 1929 International Exposition, which led to the construction of several buildings, including the and the Estadi Olímpic. Montjuïc was also the location for several venues during the 1992 Summer Olympics, with the Olympic stadium as the centerpiece. The hill is now home to the and various parks and gardens, and can be accessed via the Funicular de Montjuïc and the Montjuïc Cable Car.

==Etymology==
Montjuïc translates to &quot;Jewish Mountain&quot; from medieval Latin and Catalan, and remains of a medieval Jewish cemetery have been found there. Some sources suggest that Montjuïc is related to the Latin phrase &quot;Mons Jovicus&quot; (&#x27;hill of Jove&#x27;). The city of Girona has a hill or mountain named Montjuïc just to the north of its old quarter with a similar history; its name is derived from the medieval Jewish cemetery that was there.

==History==

Montjuïc, because of its strategic location on the Mediterranean, and alongside an important river communication channel, the Llobregat River, was the birthplace of the city of Barcelona. Archaeological discoveries have added greatly to the history of Barcelona. During the Iberian period, and especially during the Roman period Montjuïc became the main quarry of Barcelona, drastically changing the shape of the mountain.

On March 15, 2007, the General Directorate of Heritage of the Generalitat of Catalonia, in accordance with the Catalan Cultural Heritage Law (Law 9/1993, of September 30), declared Montjuic an area of Cultural Asset of National Interest (BCIN), due to the existence of the medieval Jewish cemetery in Barcelona, considered the largest in Europe of its time.

==Description==

Barcelona&#x27;s Montjuïc is a broad shallow hill with a relatively flat top overlooking the harbour, to the southwest of the city centre. The eastern side of the hill is almost a sheer cliff, giving it a commanding view over the city&#x27;s harbour immediately below. The top of the hill (a height of 184.8 m) was the site of several fortifications, the latest of which (the Castle of Montjuïc) remains today. The fortress largely dates from the 17th century, with 18th-century additions.

In 1842, the garrison (loyal to the Madrid government) shelled parts of the city. It served as a prison, often holding political prisoners, until the time of General Franco. The castle was also the site of numerous executions. In 1897, an incident popularly known as the Montjuïc trial prompted the execution of anarchist supporters and led to a severe repression of the struggle for workers&#x27; rights. During this era, &quot;Montjuïc&quot; was synonymous with barbarism based on the torture of anarchists and others imprisoned there.

On different occasions during the Spanish Civil War, both Nationalists and Republicans were executed there, each at the time when the site was held by their opponents. The former president of the Generalitat de Catalunya Lluís Companys was also executed there in 1940, having been extradited to the Franco government by the Nazis.

==Developments==



Naturally wooded, the slopes of the Montjuïc were traditionally used to grow food and graze animals by the people of the neighbouring Ciutat Vella. In the 1890s, the forests were partially cleared, opening space for parklands. The site was selected to host the 1929 International Exposition (a World&#x27;s Fair), for which the first large-scale construction on the hill began. The surviving buildings from this effort include the grand , the Estadi Olímpic (the Olympic stadium), the ornate Magic Fountain of Montjuïc (Font Màgica), and a grand staircase leading up from the foot of Montjuïc at the south end of the Avinguda de la Reina Maria Cristina, past the Font Màgica and through the Plaça del Marquès de Foronda and the Plaça de les Cascades to the . 

The Poble Espanyol, a &quot;Spanish village&quot; of different buildings built in different styles of Spanish architecture, also survives, located on the western side of the hill. Mies van der Rohe&#x27;s German national pavilion was constructed at the foot of the hill, near the Plaça del Marquès de Foronda. It was demolished in 1930 but was rebuilt in 1988.

Also completed in 1929, the Olympic stadium was intended to host an anti-fascist alternative Olympics in 1936, in opposition to the 1936 Berlin Olympics. These plans were cancelled due to the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. The stadium served as the home for football team Espanyol, until the club left for a new stadium in Cornellà/El Prat upon its completion in 2008.

The roads in the slopes facing the city were once the Montjuïc circuit Formula One race track, hosting the Spanish Grand Prix on four occasions. However, a terrible accident in the 1975 race saw Rolf Stommelen&#x27;s car crash into the stands, killing four people; as a result the Spanish Grand Prix never returned to Montjuïc circuit.

Montjuïc was selected as the site for several of the venues of the 1992 Summer Olympics, centred on the Olympic stadium. Extensively refurbished and renamed the Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys, the 65,000-seat stadium saw the opening and closing ceremonies and hosted the athletic events. Around it the &quot;Anella Olímpica&quot; (the &quot;Olympic Ring&quot;) of sporting venues was built, including the Palau Sant Jordi indoor arena, the &quot;Institut Nacional d&#x27;Educació Física de Catalunya state&quot;, a centre of sports science; the &quot;Piscines Bernat Picornell&quot; and the &quot;Piscina Municipal de Montjuïc&quot;, the venues for swimming and diving events respectively; and the striking telecommunications tower, designed by the architect Santiago Calatrava. Of the &quot;Piscines&quot; (swimming pools), the diving pool was selected as the setting for the &quot;Slow&quot; music video recorded in 2003 by Australian singer Kylie Minogue.

The ornate houses the , an extensive showcase of Catalan painting and sculpture.

The top of the hill can be reached using the Funicular de Montjuïc, a funicular railway that operates as part of the Barcelona Metro, and then the Montjuïc Cable Car, a gondola lift. On the eastern slope is the &quot;Miramar&quot; terminal of the Port Vell Aerial Tramway connecting Montjuïc with Barceloneta on the other side of Port Vell. Part of the slopes are covered with a well attended park and gardens. The hill is often used for amateur cycling.

==Prototype metre==
In June 1792 the French astronomers Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre and Pierre François André Méchain set out to measure the meridian arc distance from Dunkirk to Barcelona, two cities lying on approximately the same longitude as each other and also the longitude through Paris. The fortress on Montjuïc was chosen as the reference point in Barcelona. After protracted negotiations (France and Spain were technically at war) Méchain made his measurements from the fortress on 16 March 1794.

Using this measurement and the latitudes of the two cities they could calculate the distance between the North Pole and the Equator in classical French units of length and hence produce the first prototype metre which was defined as being one ten millionth of that distance. The definitive metre bar, manufactured from platinum, was presented to the French legislative assembly on 22 June 1799.

==Musical tributes==
In 1936, the British composers Lennox Berkeley and Benjamin Britten visited a folk dance festival on the mountain while attending a music festival in Barcelona. They took down the melodies and the following year they jointly wrote a suite of four Catalan dances for orchestra, which they named &quot;Mont Juic&quot;.

A track called &quot;Montjuic&quot; was released on the 2021 album &quot;Polydans&quot; by German musician Roosevelt.

<text>Cable-Satellite Public Affairs Network (C-SPAN ) is an American cable and satellite television network, created in 1979 by the cable television industry as a nonprofit public service. It televises proceedings of the United States federal government and other public affairs programming. C-SPAN is a private, nonprofit organization funded by its cable and satellite affiliates. It does not have advertisements on any of its television networks or radio stations, nor does it solicit donations or pledges on-air. However their official website has banner advertisements, and streamed videos also have advertisements. The network operates independently; the cable industry and the U.S. Congress have no control over its programming content.

The C-SPAN network includes the television channels C-SPAN, focusing on the U.S. House of Representatives; C-SPAN2, focusing on the U.S. Senate; and C-SPAN3, airing other government hearings and related programming; the radio station WCSP-FM; and a group of websites which provide streaming media and program archives. C-SPAN&#x27;s television channels are available to approximately 100 million cable and satellite households within the United States. WCSP-FM is broadcast on FM radio in Washington, D.C., and is available throughout the U.S. on SiriusXM, via Internet streaming, and globally through iOS and Android apps.

The network televises U.S. political events, particularly live and &quot;&quot; coverage of the U.S. Congress, as well as other major events worldwide. Coverage of political and policy events is unmoderated, providing the audience with unfiltered information about politics and government. Non-political coverage includes historical programming, programs dedicated to non-fiction books, and interview programs with noteworthy individuals associated with public policy.

==History==

===Development===

Brian Lamb, C-SPAN&#x27;s chairman and former chief executive officer, conceived C-SPAN in 1975 while working as the Washington, D.C., bureau chief of &quot;Cablevision&quot;. Cable television was a rapidly growing industry, and Lamb envisioned a non-profit network, financed by the cable industry, that televised Congressional sessions, public affairs events, and policy discussions. Bob Rosencrans, providing $25,000 of initial funding in 1979, and John D. Evans, providing wiring and access to the headend needed for the distribution of the C-SPAN signal, were among those who helped Lamb launch the network. At meetings with House of Representatives leadership, Lamb and Rosencrans promised that the network would be non-political, which helped override broadcast and local network resistance.

C-SPAN launched on March 19, 1979, for the first televised session made available by the House of Representatives, beginning with a speech by then-Tennessee representative Al Gore. Upon its debut, only 3.5 million homes were wired for C-SPAN, and the network had just three employees. For the first few years C-SPAN leased satellite time from the USA Network and had approximately 9 hours of daily programming. On February 1, 1982, C-SPAN launched its own transponder and expanded programming to 16 hours a day; the arrangement with the USA Network was discontinued two months later. C-SPAN began full-time operations on September 13, 1982.

===Channel expansion and access===
C-SPAN2 launched on June 2, 1986, to cover Senate proceedings, and began full-time operations on January 5, 1987. The Senate had debated allowing television coverage for over two years, with Majority Leader Howard Baker introducing the first, failed, resolution to allow cameras onto the floor and Senator William L. Armstrong finally succeeding in televising Senate proceedings.

In 1992, Congress passed must-carry regulations, which required cable carriers to allocate spectrum to local broadcasters. This affected the availability of C-SPAN, especially C-SPAN2, in some areas as some providers chose to discontinue carriage of the channel altogether. Between 1993 and 1994, cable systems in 95 U.S. cities dropped or reduced broadcasts of C-SPAN and C-SPAN2. Viewers protested these decisions, and some communities, such as Eugene, Oregon and Alexandria, Virginia, were successful in restoring C-SPAN availability. C-SPAN availability was broadly restored when technological improvements expanded channel capacity and allowed for both mandatory stations and the C-SPAN networks to be broadcast.

C-SPAN3, the most recent expansion channel, began full-time operations on January 22, 2001. It airs public policy and government-related events on weekdays, historical programming on weeknights and weekends, and sometimes serves as an overflow channel for live programming conflicts on C-SPAN and C-SPAN2. C-SPAN3 is the successor of a digital channel called C-SPAN Extra, which was launched in the Washington, D.C., area in 1997, and televised live and recorded political events on weekdays. C-SPAN Radio also began operations in 1997, covering similar events as the television networks and often simulcasting their programming.

In 2010, C-SPAN began a transition to high definition telecasts, planned to take place over an 18-month period. The network provided C-SPAN and C-SPAN2 in high definition on June 1, 2010, and C-SPAN3 in July 2010.

Lamb semi-retired in March 2012 and gave executive control of the network to his two lieutenants, Rob Kennedy and Susan Swain. On May 14, 2024, the C-SPAN board of directors announced that longtime CNN executive Sam Feist would become the new CEO. This announcement followed a national search initiated after Swain and Kennedy announced they would be retiring.

===Online presence===
In January 1997, C-SPAN began real-time streaming of C-SPAN and C-SPAN2 on its website. To cover the Democratic and Republican conventions and the presidential debates of 2008, C-SPAN created two standalone websites: the Convention Hub and the Debate Hub. C-span.org features further live programming such as committee hearings and speeches that are broadcast later in the day, after the House and Senate have left.

On January 12, 2017, the online feed for C-SPAN1 was interrupted and replaced by a feed from the Russian television network RT America for approximately 10 minutes. C-SPAN announced that they were troubleshooting the incident and were &quot;operating under the assumption that it was an internal routing issue.&quot;

===Camera access===
C-SPAN broadcasts video feed, but does not control the placement or number of cameras on the House and Senate floor. Arguments over C-SPAN&#x27;s camera in the House and Senate began as early as 1984, with a fight between Democrats and Republicans over camera angles. At the time C-SPAN only broadcast a shot of the person speaking. The Conservative Opportunity Society, led by Newt Gingrich, took advantage of this by delivering speeches to an empty chamber, at times referring to Democrats who were not actually there. Speaker Tip O&#x27;Neill, annoyed by the speeches, ordered the camera to display a wide-shot of the empty chamber without alerting the Republicans. The incident turned into a widely publicized argument between Gingrich and O&#x27;Neill.

After the 1984 incident, the House allowed both wide-angle shots and close-ups of the speaker until 1994, when they reverted to just close-up shots in an effort to make the House look &quot;more dignified.&quot; The Senate, which had allowed cameras since 1987, had always only allowed close-ups.

In 1994, C-SPAN requested increased camera access from both the Senate and the House of Representatives, and for permission to bring their own cameras. They asked permission to pan for wide reaction shots, and install cameras for House-Senate conference committees and off-floor interviews, among other things. They also asked permission to have C-SPAN employees man the cameras instead of government employees. These requests were rejected. Speaker Dennis Hastert rejected similar requests in 1999, as well as incoming Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2006. A December 2009 request to film healthcare negotiations was similarly denied.

In 2011, C-SPAN again requested to bring cameras onto the House floor. Incoming Speaker John Boehner rejected the request, though he did allow reporters on the floor for &#x27;special events.&#x27;

On June 22 and 23, 2016, C-SPAN took video footage of the House floor from individual House representatives via streaming services Periscope and Facebook Live during a sit-in by House Democrats asking for a vote on gun control measures after the Orlando nightclub shooting. The sit-in was out of formal session and while the House was in official recess, so the existing House cameras could not be used to cover the event. These live streams violated House rules on use of personal devices on the floor, which C-SPAN noted through on-air disclaimers.

In January 2023, C-SPAN gained widespread attention for its broadcast of the Speaker of the House vote. As the House was not in session, C-SPAN had been given permission for its cameras to roam the House floor, and capture new angles in addition to the often-permitted wide-angle and speaker close-up. After Kevin McCarthy was confirmed as Speaker, camera permissions reverted to what had previously been permitted.

==Programming==

===Senate and House of Representatives===
The C-SPAN network&#x27;s core programming is live coverage of the U.S. House and Senate, with the C-SPAN channel emphasizing the United States House of Representatives. Between 1979 and May 2011, the network televised more than 24,246 hours of floor action. C-SPAN2, the first of the C-SPAN spin-off networks, provides uninterrupted live coverage of the United States Senate. With coverage of the House and Senate, viewers can track legislation as it moves through both bodies of Congress. Important debates in Congress that C-SPAN has covered live include the Persian Gulf conflict during 1991, and the House impeachment vote and Senate trial of President Bill Clinton in 1998 and 1999 as well as the impeachment proceedings of President Trump in 2019 and 2020. When the House or Senate are not in session, C-SPAN channels broadcast other public affairs programming and recordings of previous events.

===Public affairs===
The public affairs coverage on the C-SPAN networks other than the House and Senate floor debates is wide-ranging. C-SPAN is considered a useful source of information for journalists, lobbyists, educators and government officials as well as casual viewers interested in politics, due to its unedited coverage of political events. C-SPAN has been described by media observers as a &quot;window into the world of Washington politics&quot; and it characterizes its own mission as being &quot;to provide public access to the political process&quot;. The networks cover U.S. political campaigns, including the Republican, Democratic, and Libertarian presidential nominating conventions in their entirety. Coverage of presidential campaign events are provided during the duration of the campaign, both by a weekly television program, &quot;Road to the White House&quot;, and at its dedicated politics website. C-SPAN also covers midterm elections.
All three channels televise events such as congressional hearings, White House press briefings and presidential speeches, as well as other government meetings including Federal Communications Commission hearings and Pentagon press conferences. Other U.S. political coverage includes State of the Union speeches, and presidential press conferences. According to the results of a survey after the 1992 presidential election, 85% of C-SPAN viewers voted in that election. The results of a similar survey in 2013 found that 89% of C-SPAN viewers voted in the 2012 presidential election. In addition to this political coverage, the network broadcasts press conferences and meetings of various news media and nonprofit organizations, including those at the National Press Club, public policy seminars and the White House Correspondents&#x27; Dinner. While C-SPAN does not have video access to the Supreme Court, the network has used the Court&#x27;s audio recordings accompanied by still photographs of the justices and lawyers to cover the Court in session on significant cases, and has covered individual Supreme Court justices&#x27; speaking engagements.

Occasionally, proceedings of the Parliament of Australia, Parliament of Canada, Parliament of the United Kingdom (usually Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions and the State Opening of Parliament) and other governments are shown on C-SPAN when they discuss matters of importance to viewers in the U.S. Similarly, the networks will sometimes broadcast news reports from around the world when major events occur – for instance, C-SPAN broadcast CBC Television coverage of the September 11 attacks. C-SPAN also covers lying in state in the Capitol Rotunda and funerals of former presidents and other notable individuals. In 2005, C-SPAN covered Hurricane Katrina through NBC affiliate WDSU in New Orleans, as well as coverage of Hurricane Ike via CBS affiliate KHOU in Houston. C-SPAN also carries CBC coverage during events that affect Canadians, such as the Canadian federal elections, the death and state funeral of Pierre Trudeau, and the 2003 North America blackout. During early 2011, C-SPAN carried broadcasts by Al Jazeera to cover the events in Egypt, Tunisia, and other Arab nations. Additionally, C-SPAN simulcasts NASA Space Shuttle mission launches and landings live, using video footage and audio sourced from NASA TV.

With its public affairs programming, C-SPAN intends to offer different viewpoints by allowing time for multiple opinions to be discussed on a given topic. For example, in 2004 C-SPAN intended to televise a speech by Holocaust historian Deborah Lipstadt adjacent to a speech by Holocaust denier David Irving, who had unsuccessfully sued Lipstadt for libel in the United Kingdom four years earlier; C-SPAN was criticized for its use of the word &quot;balance&quot; to describe the plan to cover both Lipstadt and Irving. When Lipstadt ended media access to her speech, C-SPAN canceled coverage of both.

The network strives for neutrality and a lack of bias; in all programming when on-camera hosts are present their role is simply to facilitate and explain proceedings to the viewer. Due to this policy, C-SPAN hosts do not state their names on television.

===C-SPAN and C-SPAN2 flagship programs===
C-SPAN covers floor proceedings of the House of Representatives, while C-SPAN 2 covers floor proceedings of the Senate. Although many hours of programming on C-SPAN are dedicated to coverage of the House, the network&#x27;s daily programming begins with the political phone-in and interview program &quot;Washington Journal&quot; from 7:00 to 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time. &quot;Washington Journal&quot; premiered on January 4, 1995, and has been broadcast every morning since then, with guests including elected officials, government administrators, and journalists. The program covers current events, with guests answering questions on topics presented by the hosts, as well as questions from members of the general public. On weeknights C-SPAN2 dedicates its schedule to &quot;Politics and Public Policy Today&quot; (9:00 p.m. – midnight for the East Coast primetime, replayed immediately for the West Coast primetime), which is a block of recordings of the day&#x27;s noteworthy events in rapid succession. On the weekend schedule, C-SPAN&#x27;s main program is &quot;Q&amp;A&quot;, a Sunday evening interview program hosted by Susan Swain, with guests including journalists, politicians, authors, and other public figures.

On weekends, C-SPAN2 dedicates its schedule to &quot;Book TV&quot;, which is 48 hours of programming about non-fiction books, book events, and authors. &quot;Book TV&quot; was launched in September 1998. &quot;Booknotes&quot; was originally broadcast from 1989 to 2004, as a one-hour one-on-one interview of a non-fiction author. Repeats of the interviews remain a regular part of the &quot;Book TV&quot; schedule with the title &quot;Encore Booknotes&quot;. Other &quot;Book TV&quot; programs feature political and historical books and biographies of public figures. These include &quot;In Depth&quot;, a live, monthly, three-hour interview with a single author, and &quot;After Words&quot;, an author interview program featuring guest hosts interviewing authors on topics with which both are familiar. &quot;After Words&quot; was developed as a new type of author interview program after the end of production of &quot;Booknotes&quot;. Weekend programming on &quot;Book TV&quot; also includes coverage of book events such as panel discussions, book fairs, book signings, readings by authors and tours of bookstores around the U.S.

===C-SPAN3===
C-SPAN 3 covers public affairs events, congressional hearings and history programming. The weekday programming on C-SPAN3 (from the morning — anywhere from 6 to 8:30 a.m. — to 8 p.m. Eastern Time) features uninterrupted live public affairs events, in particular political events from Washington, D.C. Each weekend since January 8, 2011, the network has broadcast 48 hours of programming dedicated to the history of the United States, under the umbrella title &quot;American History TV&quot;. The programming covers the history of the U.S. from the founding of the nation through the late 20th century. Programs include &quot;American Artifacts&quot;, which is dedicated to exploring museums, archives and historical sites, and &quot;Lectures in History&quot;, featuring major university history professors giving lectures on U.S. history. In 2009, C-SPAN3 aired an eight-installment series of interviews from the Robert J. Dole Institute of Politics at the University of Kansas, which featured historian Richard Norton Smith and Vice President Walter Mondale, among other interviewees.

===Special programming===
C-SPAN has also occasionally produced special episodes and series. In 1989, C-SPAN celebrated its 10th anniversary with a three-hour retrospective on the history of the network. In 1994, &quot;Booknotes&quot; collaborated with Lincoln scholar Harold Holzer to produce reenactments of the 1858 Lincoln–Douglas debates for the network&#x27;s 15th anniversary. The Alexis de Tocqueville Tour: Exploring Democracy in America and &quot;American Writers: A Journey Through History&quot; took viewers on tours of the United States, themed around Alexis de Tocqueville&#x27;s travels and the works of 40 famous American writers, respectively. The year-long series &quot;American Presidents: Life Portraits&quot;, produced to commemorate the 20th anniversary of C-SPAN, won a Peabody Award. The network has also produced special feature documentaries on the history of various American institutions and landmarks. In 2005, C-SPAN hosted a 25-hour &quot;call-in marathon&quot; and essay contest, the winner of which was invited to co-host an hour of the broadcast, to commemorate 25 years of taking viewer telephone calls.

===Radio broadcasts===
In addition to the three television networks, C-SPAN also broadcasts via C-SPAN Radio, which is carried on their owned-and-operated station WCSP-FM (90.1 FM) in the Washington, D.C., area with all three cable network feeds airing via HD Radio subchannels, and nationwide on XM Satellite Radio. Its programming is also livestreamed at c-span.org and is available via apps for iPhone, BlackBerry and Android devices. C-SPAN Radio has a selective policy regarding its broadcast content, rather than duplicating the television network programming, although it does offer some audio simulcasts of programs such as &quot;Washington Journal&quot;. Unique programming on the radio station includes oral histories, and some committee meetings and press conferences not shown on television due to programming commitments. The station also compiles the Sunday morning talk shows for a same-day rebroadcast without commercials, in rapid succession.

===Online availability ===

C-SPAN archival video is available through the C-SPAN Video Library, maintained at the Purdue Research Park in West Lafayette, Indiana. Unveiled in August 2007, the C-SPAN Video Library contains all of the network&#x27;s programming since 1987, totaling more than 160,000 hours at its completion of digitization and public debut in March 2010. Older C-SPAN programming continues to be added to the library, dating back to the beginning of the network in 1979, and some limited earlier footage from the National Archives, such as film clips of Richard Nixon&#x27;s 1972 trip to China, is available as well. Most of the recordings before 1987 (when the C-SPAN Archive was established) were not saved, except for approximately 10,000 hours of video which are slated to be made available online. , the C-SPAN Video Library held over 271,000 hours of programming, and they have been viewed over 253 million times. Described by media commentators as a major educational service and a valuable resource for researchers of politics and history, the C-SPAN Video Library has also had a major role in media and opposition research in several U.S. political campaigns. It won a Peabody Award in 2010 &quot;for creating an enduring archive of the history of American policymaking, and for providing it as a free, user-friendly public service.&quot;

Prior to the initiation of the C-SPAN Video Library, websites such as Metavid and voterwatch.org hosted House and Senate video records, however C-SPAN contested Metavid&#x27;s usage of C-SPAN copyrighted footage. The result was Metavid&#x27;s removal of portions of the archive produced with C-SPAN&#x27;s cameras, while preserving its archive of government-produced content. C-SPAN also engaged in actions to stop parties from making unauthorized uses of its content online, including its video of House and Senate proceedings. Most notably, in May 2006, C-SPAN requested the removal of Stephen Colbert&#x27;s performance at the White House Correspondents&#x27; Association Dinner from YouTube. After concerns by some webloggers, C-SPAN gave permission for Google Video to host the full event. On March 7, 2007, C-SPAN liberalized its copyright policy for current, future, and past coverage of any official events sponsored by Congress and any federal agency and now allows for attributed non-commercial copying, sharing, and posting of C-SPAN video on the Internet, excluding re-syndication of live video streams. The new policy did not affect the public&#x27;s right to use the public domain video coverage of the floor proceedings of the U.S. House and Senate.

In 2008, C-SPAN&#x27;s online political coverage was expanded just prior to the elections, with the introduction of three special pages on the C-SPAN website: the C-SPAN Convention Hubs and C-SPAN Debate Hub, which offered video of major events as well as discussion from weblogs and social media about the major party conventions and candidate debates. C-SPAN brought back the Convention Hub for the 2012 presidential election.

In addition to the programming available in the C-SPAN Video Library, all C-SPAN programming is available as a live feed streamed on its website in Flash Video format.

On July 29, 2014, C-SPAN announced that it would begin restricting access to the live feeds of the main channel, C-SPAN2 and C-SPAN3 to subscribers of cable or satellite providers later that summer, citing concerns with the slow shift in viewing habits from cable television to the internet due to its reliance on carriage fees from cable and satellite providers. However, it will continue to allow all government meetings, hearings and conferences to be streamed live online and via archived on the C-SPAN Video Library without requiring an authenticated login by a provider; live audio feeds of all three channels are also available for free through the network&#x27;s mobile app. The decision drew some criticism from public interest and government transparency advocates, citing the fact that C-SPAN was designed as a public service. , C-SPAN has begun advertising on its online videos, with YouTube-style advertisements that can be skipped after five seconds.

==Organization and operations==
C-SPAN is operated by the National Cable Satellite Corporation, a nonprofit organization. Early chairmen included Bob Rosencrans, John Saeman, Ed Allen and Gene Schneider.

As a non-commercial public service, C-SPAN receives most of its funding from subscriber fees charged to cable and direct-broadcast satellite (DBS) operators. , C-SPAN received 6¢ of each subscriber&#x27;s cable bill for an annual budget of $60 million. C-SPAN began airing internet commercials early in 2021 and now sells C-SPAN merchandise.

As the network is an independent entity, neither the cable industry nor Congress controls the content of its programming.

, the network has 282 or 337 employees. C-SPAN has for many years led by co-CEOs Rob Kennedy and Susan Swain. Founder and former CEO Brian Lamb serves as the executive chairman of the board of directors. 

On May 14, 2024, the C-SPAN board of directors announced that longtime CNN executive Sam Feist would become the new CEO. This announcement followed a national search initiated after Swain and Kennedy announced they would be retiring. Swain will stay on as CEO until Feist officially begins his duties in the summer of 2024.

The majority of C-SPAN&#x27;s employees are based at C-SPAN&#x27;s headquarters located on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. In 2003 television studios were opened in New York City and Denver, Colorado. These studios use digital equipment that can be controlled from Washington.

C-SPAN also maintains archives in West Lafayette, Indiana, at the Purdue Research Park under the direction of Robert X. Browning.

==Audience==
The C-SPAN networks are available in more than 100 million households , not including access to the C-SPAN websites. More than 7,000 telephone callers have participated with discussion on &quot;Washington Journal&quot; . There are no official viewing statistics for C-SPAN because the network, which has no commercials or underwriting advertisements, does not use the Nielsen ratings. However, there have been a number of surveys providing estimates:
* A 1994 survey found that 8.6% of the U.S. population regularly watched C-SPAN.
* In 2004 this figure increased to 12% of the U.S. population, according to a Pew Research Center survey, while 31% of the population was categorized as occasional viewers. More than 28 million people said they watched C-SPAN programming each week.
* A March 2009 Hart Research survey found that 20% of homes with cable television watch C-SPAN at least once a week, for an estimated 39 million Americans.
* A 2010 poll conducted by C-SPAN and Penn Schoen Berland estimates that 79 million adults in the U.S. watched C-SPAN at some time from 2009 to 2010.
* In January 2013, Hart Research conducted another survey which showed that 47 million adults, or 24% of adults with access to cable television, watch C-SPAN weekly. Of the 47 million regular C-SPAN viewers, 51% are male and 49% female; 26% are liberal, 31% conservative, and 39% moderate. About half are college graduates. 28% of 18-to-49-year-olds report watching at least once a week, as do 19% of 50- to 64-year-olds, and 22% of those over age 65.
*In February 2017, Ipsos Audience conducted another survey which showed that 70 million adults, or 36% of adults with access to cable television, watch C-SPAN on a given six-month period. Of the 70 million regular C-SPAN viewers, 52% are male and 48% female; 25% are West viewers, 22% Midwest, 20% Northeast and 33% South. 28% identified themselves as liberal, 27% conservative, and 36% moderate. 51% of all viewers are 18–44 years old.

==Public and media opinion==
C-SPAN&#x27;s public service nature has been praised as an enduring contribution to national knowledge. In 1987, Andrew Rosenthal wrote for &quot;The New York Times&quot; about C-SPAN&#x27;s influence in political elections, arguing that C-SPAN&#x27;s &quot;blanket coverage&quot; had expanded television journalism &quot;into areas once shielded from general view&quot;. The network has received positive media coverage for providing public access to proceedings such as the Goldman Sachs Senate hearings, and the U.S. 2010 Healthcare Summit, while its everyday programming has been credited with providing the media and the general public with an intimate knowledge of U.S. political proceedings and people. The ability of C-SPAN to provide this service without federal funding, advertising or soliciting viewer contributions has been remarked by local newspapers and online news services, with the &quot;Daily Beast&quot; terming C-SPAN&#x27;s $55 million annual budget (in 2009), &quot;an astounding bargain.&quot; In an article on the 25th anniversary of the network, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; noted that C-SPAN&#x27;s programming has been copied by television networks worldwide and credits the network with providing information about foreign politics to American viewers. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, C-SPAN&#x27;s mission to record official events in Washington, D.C., makes it &quot;one of a kind&quot;, particularly in the creation of the C-SPAN Video Library, which received significant press coverage.

Despite its stated commitment to providing politically balanced programming, C-SPAN and its shows such as &quot;Washington Journal&quot;, &quot;Booknotes&quot;, &quot;Q &amp; A&quot;, and &quot;After Words&quot; have been accused by some liberal organizations of having a conservative bias. In 2005, the media criticism organization Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) released a study of C-SPAN&#x27;s morning telephone call-in show &quot;Washington Journal&quot;. In their six-month sample of guests, they identified 32 as &quot;right-of-center&quot; and 19 as &quot;left-of-center&quot;; they also noted people of color are underrepresented at 15% of the guest list. A 2007 survey released by the think tank Center for Economic and Policy Research reported that C-SPAN covered conservative think tanks more than left-of-center think tanks.

==Other services==

C-SPAN offers a number of public services related to the network&#x27;s public affairs programming. C-SPAN Classroom, a free membership service for teachers, began in July 1987 and offers help using C-SPAN resources for classes or research. The C-SPAN School Bus, introduced in November 1993, traveled around the U.S. educating the public about government and politics using C-SPAN resources, and served as a mobile television studio. The bus also recorded video footage of the places that it visited. A second bus was introduced in 1996. The two original buses were retired in 2010, and the C-SPAN Digital Bus was inaugurated, introducing the public to C-SPAN&#x27;s enhanced digital products. C-SPAN has also equipped six Local Content Vehicles (LCVs) to travel the country and record unique political and historical stories, with each vehicle containing production and web-based technologies to produce on-the-spot content.

C-SPAN has published ten books based on its programming; these contain original material and text taken from interview transcripts. The first C-SPAN book, &quot;C-SPAN: America&#x27;s Town Hall&quot;, was published in 1988. Other C-SPAN books include: &quot;Gavel to Gavel: A C-SPAN Guide to Congress&quot;; &quot;Who&#x27;s Buried in Grant&#x27;s Tomb?&quot;, a guide to the grave sites of U.S. presidents; &quot;Abraham Lincoln - Great American Historians On Our Sixteenth President&quot;, a collection of essays based on C-SPAN interviews with American historians; and &quot;The Supreme Court&quot;, which features biographies and interviews with past Supreme Court judges together with commentary from legal experts. Five books have been drawn from the former &quot;Booknotes&quot; program: &quot;Booknotes: Life Stories&quot;; &quot;Booknotes: On American Character&quot;; &quot;Booknotes: Stories from American History&quot;; &quot;Booknotes: America&#x27;s Finest Authors on Reading, Writing and the Power of Ideas&quot;, the latter a compilation of short monologues taken from the transcripts of Lamb&#x27;s interviews; and a companion book to the series on Tocqueville, &quot;Traveling Tocqueville&#x27;s America: A Tour Book&quot;.

==Prank calls and obscenities==
Due to the open phone lines on &quot;Washington Journal&quot;, C-SPAN has been noted to have a tradition of prank calls. Calls have ranged from crude jokes about Howard Stern and Bababooey to racist tirades against Martin Luther King Jr and questions regarding the size of Mitt Romney&#x27;s penis. One particularly well-known instance happened in 2015, when during a segment on the Iran nuclear deal framework, a man calling himself Jack Strickland called in claiming to be from Bel-Air, California, before promptly reciting the theme song of &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; TV show. Obscenities have also made it into broadcasts, such as in 2014 where a caller said &quot;The Republicans hate that nigger Obama.&quot; before being kicked off the air. The network implemented a 3-second broadcast delay in 2016 to combat these types of calls.
