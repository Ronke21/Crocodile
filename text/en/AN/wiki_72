<text>Blender is a free and open-source 3D computer graphics software tool set that runs on Windows, macOS, BSD, Haiku, IRIX and Linux. It is used for creating animated films, visual effects, art, 3D-printed models, motion graphics, interactive 3D applications, and virtual reality. It is also used in creating video games.

==History==

Blender was initially developed as an in-house application by the Dutch animation studio NeoGeo (no relation to the video game brand), and was officially launched on January 2, 1994. Version 1.00 was released in January 1995, with the primary author being the company co-owner and software developer Ton Roosendaal. The name &quot;Blender&quot; was inspired by a song by the Swiss electronic band Yello, from the album &quot;Baby&quot;, which NeoGeo used in its showreel. Some design choices and experiences for Blender were carried over from an earlier software application, called Traces, that Roosendaal developed for NeoGeo on the Commodore Amiga platform during the 1987–1991 period.

On January 1, 1998, Blender was released publicly online as SGI freeware. NeoGeo was later dissolved, and its client contracts were taken over by another company. After NeoGeo&#x27;s dissolution, Ton Roosendaal founded Not a Number Technologies (NaN, a reference to the computing term of the same name) in June 1998 to further develop Blender, initially distributing it as shareware until NaN went bankrupt in 2002. This also resulted in the discontinuation of Blender&#x27;s development.

In May 2002, Roosendaal started the non-profit Blender Foundation, with the first goal to find a way to continue developing and promoting Blender as a community-based open-source project. On July 18, 2002, Roosendaal started the &quot;Free Blender&quot; campaign, a crowdfunding precursor. The campaign aimed at open-sourcing Blender for a one-time payment of €100,000 (USD 100,670 at the time), with the money being collected from the community. On September 7, 2002, it was announced that they had collected enough funds and would release the Blender source code. Today, Blender is free and open-source software, largely developed by its community as well as 26 full-time employees and 12 freelancers employed by the Blender Institute.

The Blender Foundation initially reserved the right to use dual licensing so that, in addition to GPL 2.0-or-later, Blender would have been available also under the &quot;Blender License&quot;, which did not require disclosing source code but required payments to the Blender Foundation. However, this option was never exercised and was suspended indefinitely in 2005. Blender is solely available under &quot;GNU GPLv2 or any later&quot; and was not updated to the GPLv3, as &quot;no evident benefits&quot; were seen. The binary releases of Blender are under GNU GPLv3 or later because of the incorporated Apache libraries.

In 2019, with the release of version 2.80, the integrated game engine for making and prototyping video games was removed; Blender&#x27;s developers recommended that users migrate to more powerful open source game engines such as Godot instead.

==Suzanne==

In February 2002, the fate of the Blender software company, NaN, became evident as it faced imminent closure in March. Nevertheless, one more release was pushed out, Blender 2.25. As a sort of Easter egg and last personal tag, the artists and developers decided to add a 3D model of a chimpanzee head (called a &quot;monkey&quot; in the software). It was created by Willem-Paul van Overbruggen (SLiD3), who named it Suzanne, after the orangutan in the Kevin Smith film &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot;.

Suzanne is Blender&#x27;s alternative to more common test models such as the Utah Teapot and the Stanford Bunny. A low-polygon model with only 500 faces, Suzanne is included in Blender and often used as a quick and easy way to test materials, animations, rigs, textures, and lighting setups. It is as easily added to a scene as primitives such as a cube or plane.

The largest Blender contest gives out an award called the Suzanne Award, underscoring the significance of this unique 3D model in the Blender community.

==Features==
===Modeling===
Blender has support for a variety of geometric primitives, including polygon meshes, Bézier curves, NURBS surfaces, metaballs, icospheres, text, and an n-gon modeling system called B-mesh. There is also an advanced polygonal modelling system which can be accessed through an edit mode. It supports features such as extrusion, bevelling, and subdividing.

====Modifiers====
Modifiers apply non-destructive effects which can be applied upon rendering or exporting, such as subdivision surfaces.

====Sculpting====
Blender has multi-resolution digital sculpting, which includes dynamic topology, &quot;baking&quot;, remeshing, re-symmetrization, and decimation. The latter is used to simplify models for exporting purposes (an example being game assets).

====Geometry nodes====

Blender has a node graph system for procedurally and non-destructively creating and manipulating geometry. It was first added to Blender 2.92, which focuses on object scattering and instancing. It takes the form of a modifier, so it can be stacked over other different modifiers. The system uses object attributes, which can be modified and overridden with string inputs. Attributes can include positions, normals and UV maps. All attributes can be viewed in an attribute spreadsheet editor. The Geometry Nodes utility also has the capability of creating primitive meshes. In Blender 3.0, support for creating and modifying curves objects was added to Geometry Nodes; in the same release, the Geometry Nodes workflow was completely redesigned with fields, in order to make the system more intuitive and work like shader nodes.

===Simulation===
Blender can be used to simulate smoke, rain, dust, cloth, fluids, hair, and rigid bodies.

====Fluid simulation====
The fluid simulator can be used for simulating liquids, like water being poured into a cup. It uses Lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM) to simulate fluids and allows for plenty of adjustment of particles and resolution. The particle physics fluid simulation creates particles that follow the smoothed-particle hydrodynamics method.

Blender has simulation tools for soft-body dynamics, including mesh collision detection, LBM fluid dynamics, smoke simulation, Bullet rigid-body dynamics, an ocean generator with waves, a particle system that includes support for particle-based hair, and real-time control during physics simulation and rendering.

In Blender 2.82, a new fluid simulation system called Mantaflow was added, replacing the old FLIP system. In Blender 2.92, another fluid simulation system called APIC, which builds on Mantaflow, was added. Vortices and more stable calculations are improved from the FLIP system.

====Cloth Simulation====
Cloth simulation is done by simulating vertices with a rigid body simulation. If done on a 3D mesh, it will produce similar effects as the soft body simulation.

===Animation===
Blender&#x27;s keyframed animation capabilities include inverse kinematics, armatures, hooks, curve- and lattice-based deformations, shape keys, non-linear animation, constraints, and vertex weighting. In addition, its Grease Pencil tools allow for 2D animation within a full 3D pipeline.

===Rendering===
Blender includes three render engines since version 2.80: EEVEE, Workbench and Cycles.

Cycles is a path tracing render engine. It supports rendering through both the CPU and the GPU. Cycles supports the Open Shading Language since Blender 2.65.

Cycles Hybrid Rendering is possible in Version 2.92 with Optix. Tiles are calculated with GPU in combination with CPU.

EEVEE is a new physically based real-time renderer. While it is capable of driving Blender&#x27;s real-time viewport for creating assets thanks to its speed, it can also work as a renderer for final frames.

Workbench is a real-time render engine designed for fast rendering during modelling and animation preview. It is not intended for final rendering. Workbench supports assigning colors to objects for visual distinction.

====Cycles====

Cycles is a path-tracing render engine that is designed to be interactive and easy to use, while still supporting many features. It has been included with Blender since 2011, with the release of Blender 2.61. Cycles supports with AVX, AVX2 and AVX-512 extensions, as well as CPU acceleration in modern hardware.

=====GPU rendering=====
Cycles supports GPU rendering, which is used to speed up rendering times. There are three GPU rendering modes: CUDA, which is the preferred method for older Nvidia graphics cards; OptiX, which utilizes the hardware ray-tracing capabilities of Nvidia&#x27;s Turing architecture &amp; Ampere architecture; HIP, which supports rendering on AMD Radeon graphics cards; and oneAPI for Intel and Intel Arc GPUs. The toolkit software associated with these rendering modes does not come within Blender and needs to be separately installed and configured as per their respective source instructions.

Multiple GPUs are also supported (with the notable exception of the EEVEE render engine) which can be used to create a render farm to speed up rendering by processing frames or tiles in parallel—having multiple GPUs, however, does not increase the available memory since each GPU can only access its own memory. Since Version 2.90, this limitation of SLI cards is broken with Nvidia&#x27;s NVLink.

Apple&#x27;s Metal API got initial implementation in Blender 3.1 for Apple computers with M1 chips and AMD graphics cards.

=====Integrator=====
The integrator is the core rendering algorithm used for lighting computations. Cycles currently supports a path tracing integrator with direct light sampling. It works well for a variety of lighting setups, but it is not as suitable for caustics and certain other complex lighting situations. Rays are traced from the camera into the scene, bouncing around until they find a light source (a lamp, an object material emitting light, or the world background), or until they are simply terminated based on the number of maximum bounces determined in the light path settings for the renderer. To find lamps and surfaces emitting light, both indirect light sampling (letting the ray follow the surface bidirectional scattering distribution function, or BSDF) and direct light sampling (picking a light source and tracing a ray towards it) are used.

The default path tracing integrator is a &quot;pure&quot; path tracer. This integrator works by sending several light rays that act as photons from the camera out into the scene. These rays will eventually hit either: a light source, an object, or the world background. If these rays hit an object, they will bounce based on the angle of impact, and continue bouncing until a light source has been reached or until a maximum number of bounces, as determined by the user, which will cause it to terminate and result in a black, unlit pixel. Multiple rays are calculated and averaged out for each pixel, a process known as &quot;sampling&quot;. This sampling number is set by the user and greatly affects the final image. Lower sampling often results in more noise and has the potential to create &quot;fireflies&quot; (which are uncharacteristically bright pixels), while higher sampling greatly reduces noise, but also increases render times.

The alternative is a branched path tracing integrator, which works mostly the same way. Branched path tracing splits the light rays at each intersection with an object according to different surface components, and takes all lights into account for shading instead of just one. This added complexity makes computing each ray slower but reduces noise in the render, especially in scenes dominated by direct (one-bounce) lighting. This was removed in Blender 3.0 with the advent of Cycles X, as improvements to the pure path tracing integrator made the branched path tracing integrator redundant 

=====Open Shading Language=====
Blender users can create their own nodes using the Open Shading Language (OSL); this allows users to create stunning materials that are entirely procedural, which allows them to be used on any objects without stretching the texture as opposed to image-based textures which need to be made to fit a certain object. (Note that the shader nodes editor is shown in the image, although mostly correct, has undergone a slight change, changing how the UI is structured and looks. 
=====Materials=====
Materials define the look of meshes, NURBS curves, and other geometric objects. They consist of three shaders to define the mesh&#x27;s surface appearance, volume inside, and surface displacement.

The &quot;surface shader&quot; defines the light interaction at the surface of the mesh. One or more bidirectional scattering distribution functions, or BSDFs, can specify if incoming light is reflected, refracted into the mesh, or absorbed. The alpha value is one measure of translucency.

When the surface shader does not reflect or absorb light, it enters the volume (light transmission). If no volume shader is specified, it will pass straight through (or be refracted, see refractive index or IOR) to another side of the mesh.

If one is defined, a &quot;volume shader&quot; describes the light interaction as it passes through the volume of the mesh. Light may be scattered, absorbed, or even emitted at any point in the volume.

The shape of the surface may be altered by &quot;displacement shaders&quot;. In this way, textures can be used to make the mesh surface more detailed.

Depending on the settings, the displacement may be virtual-only modifying the surface normals to give the impression of displacement (also known as bump mapping) – real, or a combination of real displacement with bump mapping.

====EEVEE====
EEVEE (or Eevee) is a real-time PBR renderer included in Blender from version 2.8. This render engine was given the nickname EEVEE, after the Pokémon. The name was later made into the backronym &quot;Extra Easy Virtual Environment Engine&quot; or EEVEE.

With the release of Blender 4.2 LTS in July 2024, EEVEE received an overhaul by its lead developer, Clément Foucault, called EEVEE Next. EEVEE Next boasts a variety of new features for Blender&#x27;s real-time and rasterised renderer, including screen-space global illumination (SSGI), virtual shadowmapping, sunlight extraction from HDRIs, and a rewritten system for reflections and indirect lighting via light probe volumes and cubemaps. EEVEE Next also brings improved volumetric rendering, along with support for &quot;displacement shaders&quot; and an improved depth of field system similar to Cycles.

Plans for future releases of EEVEE include support for hardware-accelerated ray-tracing and continued improvements to performance and shader compilation.

====Texturing and shading====
Blender allows procedural and node-based textures, as well as texture painting, projective painting, vertex painting, weight painting and dynamic painting.

===Post-production===

Blender has a node-based compositor within the rendering pipeline, which is accelerated with OpenCL, and in 4.0 it supports GPU. It also includes a non-linear video editor called the Video Sequence Editor (VSE), with support for effects like Gaussian blur, color grading, fade and wipe transitions, and other video transformations. However, there is no built-in multi-core support for rendering video with the VSE.

===Plugins/addons and scripts===
Blender supports Python scripting for the creation of custom tools, prototyping, importing/exporting from other formats, and task automation. This allows for integration with several external render engines through plugins/addons. Blender itself can also be compiled &amp; imported as a python library for further automation and development.

===File format===
Blender features an internal file system that can pack multiple scenes into a single &quot;.blend&quot; file.

* Most of Blender&#x27;s &quot;.blend&quot; files are forward, backward, and cross-platform compatible with other versions of Blender, with the following exceptions:
** Loading animations stored in post-2.5 files in Blender pre-2.5. This is due to the reworked animation subsystem introduced in Blender 2.5 being inherently incompatible with older versions.
** Loading meshes stored in post 2.63. This is due to the introduction of BMesh, a more versatile mesh format.
** Blender 2.8 &quot;.blend&quot; files are no longer fully backward compatible, causing errors when opened in previous versions.
** Many 3.x &quot;.blend&quot; files are not completely backwards-compatible as well, and may cause errors with previous versions.
* All scenes, objects, materials, textures, sounds, images, and post-production effects for an entire animation can be packaged and stored in a single &quot;.blend&quot; file. Data loaded from external sources, such as images and sounds, can also be stored externally and referenced through either an absolute or relative file path. Likewise, &quot;.blend&quot; files themselves can also be used as libraries of Blender assets.
* Interface configurations are retained in &quot;.blend&quot; files.

A wide variety of import/export scripts that extend Blender capabilities (accessing the object data via an internal API) make it possible to interoperate with other 3D tools.

Blender organizes data as various kinds of &quot;data blocks&quot; (akin to glTF), such as Objects, Meshes, Lamps, Scenes, Materials, Images, and so on. An object in Blender consists of multiple data blocks – for example, what the user would describe as a polygon mesh consists of at least an Object and a Mesh data block, and usually also a Material and many more, linked together. This allows various data blocks to refer to each other. There may be, for example, multiple Objects that refer to the same Mesh, and making subsequent editing of the shared mesh results in shape changes in all Objects using this Mesh. Objects, meshes, materials, textures, etc. can also be linked to other .blend files, which is what allows the use of .blend files as reusable resource libraries.

====Import and export====
The software supports a variety of 3D file formats for import and export, among them Alembic, 3D Studio (3DS), FBX, DXF, SVG, STL (for 3D printing), UDIM, USD, VRML, WebM, X3D and OBJ.

===Deprecated features===
====Blender Game Engine====
The Blender Game Engine was a built-in real-time graphics and logic engine with features such as collision detection, a dynamics engine, and programmable logic. It also allowed the creation of stand-alone, real-time applications ranging from architectural visualization to video games. In April 2018, the engine was removed from the upcoming Blender 2.8 release series, due to updates and revisions to the engine lagging behind other game engines such as Unity and the open-source Godot. In the 2.8 announcements, the Blender team specifically mentioned the Godot engine as a suitable replacement for migrating Blender Game Engine users.

====Blender Internal====
Blender Internal, a biased rasterization engine and scanline renderer used in previous versions of Blender, was also removed for the 2.80 release in favor of the new &quot;EEVEE&quot; renderer, a realtime physically based renderer.

==User interface==
===Commands===
Most of the commands are accessible via hotkeys. There are also comprehensive graphical menus. Numeric buttons can be &quot;dragged&quot; to change their value directly without the need to aim at a particular widget, as well as being set using the keyboard. Both sliders and number buttons can be constrained to various step sizes with modifiers like the and keys. Python expressions can also be typed directly into number entry fields, allowing mathematical expressions to specify values.

===Modes===
Blender includes many modes for interacting with objects, the two primary ones being &quot;Object Mode&quot; and &quot;Edit Mode&quot;, which are toggled with the key. Object mode is used to manipulate individual objects as a unit, while Edit mode is used to manipulate the actual object data. For example, an Object Mode can be used to move, scale, and rotate entire polygon meshes, and Edit Mode can be used to manipulate the individual vertices of a single mesh. There are also several other modes, such as Vertex Paint, Weight Paint, and Sculpt Mode.

===Workspaces===
The Blender GUI builds its tiled windowing system on top of one or multiple windows provided by the underlying platform. One platform window (often sized to fill the screen) is divided into sections and subsections that can be of any type of Blender&#x27;s views or window types. The user can define multiple layouts of such Blender windows, called screens, and switch quickly between them by selecting from a menu or with keyboard shortcuts. Each window type&#x27;s own GUI elements can be controlled with the same tools that manipulate the 3D view. For example, one can zoom in and out of GUI-buttons using similar controls, one zooms in and out in the 3D viewport. The GUI viewport and screen layout are fully user-customizable. It is possible to set up the interface for specific tasks such as video editing or UV mapping or texturing by hiding features not used for the task.

==Development==

Since the opening of the source code, Blender has experienced significant refactoring of the initial codebase and major additions to its feature set.

Improvements include an animation system refresh; a stack-based modifier system; an updated particle system (which can also be used to simulate hair and fur); fluid dynamics; soft-body dynamics; GLSL shaders support in the game engine; advanced UV unwrapping; a fully recoded render pipeline, allowing separate render passes and &quot;render to texture&quot;; node-based material editing and compositing; and projection painting.

Part of these developments was fostered by Google&#x27;s Summer of Code program, in which the Blender Foundation has participated since 2005.

Historically, Blender has used Phabricator to manage its development but due to the announcement in 2021 that Phabricator would be discontinued, the Blender Institute began work on migrating to another software in early 2022. After extensive debate on what software it should choose it was finally decided to migrate to Gitea. The migration from Phabricator to Gitea is currently a work in progress.

===Blender 2.8===
Official planning for the next major revision of Blender after the 2.7 series began in the latter half of 2015, with potential targets including a more configurable UI (dubbed &quot;Blender 101&quot;), support for physically based rendering (PBR) (dubbed EEVEE for &quot;Extra Easy Virtual Environment Engine&quot;) to bring improved realtime 3D graphics to the viewport, allowing the use of C++11 and C99 in the codebase, moving to a newer version of OpenGL and dropping support for versions before 3.2, and a possible overhaul of the particle and constraint systems. Blender Internal renderer has been removed from 2.8. &quot;Code Quest&quot; was a project started in April 2018 set in Amsterdam, at the Blender Institute. The goal of the project was to get a large development team working in one place, in order to speed up the development of Blender 2.8. By June 29, 2018, the Code Quest project ended, and on July 2, the alpha version was completed. Beta testing commenced on November 29, 2018, and was anticipated to take until July 2019. Blender 2.80 was released on July 30, 2019.

===Cycles X===
On April 23, 2021, the Blender Foundation announced the Cycles X project, where they improved the Cycles architecture for future development. Key changes included a new kernel, removal of default tiled rendering (replaced by progressive refine), removal of branched path tracing, and the removal of OpenCL support. Volumetric rendering was also replaced with better algorithms. Cycles X had only been accessible in an experimental branch until September 21, 2021, when it was merged into the Blender 3.0 alpha.

==Support==
Blender is extensively documented on its website. There are also a number of online communities dedicated to support, such as the Blender Stack Exchange.

==Modified versions==
Due to Blender&#x27;s open-source nature, other programs have tried to take advantage of its success by repackaging and selling cosmetically modified versions of it. Examples include IllusionMage, 3DMofun, 3DMagix, and Fluid Designer, the latter being recognized as Blender-based.

==Use in industry==

Blender started as an in-house tool for NeoGeo, a Dutch commercial animation company. The first large professional project that used Blender was &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;, where it was primarily used to create animatics and pre-visualizations for the storyboard department.

The French-language film &quot;Friday or Another Day&quot; (&quot;&quot;) was the first 35 mm feature film to use Blender for all the special effects, made on Linux workstations. It won a prize at the Locarno International Film Festival. The special effects were by Digital Graphics of Belgium.

Tomm Moore&#x27;s &quot;The Secret of Kells&quot;, which was partly produced in Blender by the Belgian studio Digital Graphics, has been nominated for an Oscar in the category &quot;Best Animated Feature Film&quot;. Blender has also been used for shows on the History Channel, alongside many other professional 3D graphics programs.

NASA used 
Blender to develop an interactive web application Experience Curiosity to celebrate the 3rd anniversary of the &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover landing on Mars. This app makes it possible to operate the rover, control its cameras and the robotic arm and reproduces some of the prominent events of the Mars Science Laboratory mission. The application was presented at the beginning of the WebGL section on SIGGRAPH 2015. Blender is also used by NASA for many publicly available 3D models. Many 3D models on NASA&#x27;s 3D resources page are in a native .blend format. 

Blender was used for both CGI and compositing for the movie &quot;Hardcore Henry&quot;. The visual effects in the feature film &quot;Sabogal&quot; were done in Blender. VFX supervisor Bill Westenhofer used Blender to create the character &quot;Murloc&quot; in the 2016 film &quot;Warcraft&quot;.

Director David F. Sandberg used Blender for multiple shots in &quot;Lights Out&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. 

Blender was used for parts of the credit sequences in &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;

Blender was used in several cases for the 2023 film Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. Sony Pictures Imageworks, the primary studio behind the film&#x27;s animation, used Blender&#x27;s Grease Pencil for adding line-work and 2D FX animation alongside 3D models. At 14 years old, Canadian animator Preston Mutanga used Blender to create the Lego-style sequence in the film. Mutanga was recruited after his fan-made Lego-style recreation of the film&#x27;s teaser caught the attention of the filmmakers.

The 2024 Latvian film &quot;Flow&quot; was made entirely in Blender using the EEVEE render engine.

==Open projects==

Since 2005, every one to two years the Blender Foundation has announced a new creative project to help drive innovation in Blender. In response to the success of the first open movie project, &quot;Elephants Dream&quot;, in 2006, the Blender Foundation founded the Blender Institute to be in charge of additional projects, such as films: &quot;Big Buck Bunny&quot;, &quot;Sintel&quot;, &quot;Tears of Steel&quot;, Flow; and &quot;Yo Frankie!&quot;, or Project Apricot, an open game utilizing the Crystal Space game engine that reused some of the assets created for &quot;Big Buck Bunny&quot;.

<text>Diomedes () or Diomede (; ) is a hero in Greek mythology, known for his participation in the Trojan War.

He was born to Tydeus and Deipyle and later became King of Argos, succeeding his maternal grandfather, Adrastus. In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; Diomedes is regarded alongside Ajax the Great and Agamemnon, after Achilles, as one of the best warriors of all the Achaeans in prowess (which is especially made clear in Book 7 of the &quot;Iliad&quot; when Ajax the Greater, Diomedes, and Agamemnon are the most wished for by the Achaeans to fight Hector out of nine volunteers, who included Odysseus and Ajax the Lesser). Subsequently, Diomedes founded ten or more Italian cities and, after his death, was worshipped as a divine being under various names in both Italy and Greece.

== Description ==
In the account of Dares the Phrygian, Diomedes was illustrated as &quot;stocky, brave, dignified, and austere. He was loud at the war-cry, hot-tempered, impatient, and daring.&quot;

==Early myths==
Diomedes was, on his father&#x27;s side, an Aetolian, and on his mother&#x27;s an Argive. His father, Tydeus, was himself of royal blood, being the son of Oeneus, the king of Calydon. He had been exiled from his homeland for killing his relatives, either his cousins or his paternal uncles. In any case, Tydeus was exiled, and he found refuge at Argos, where the king, Adrastus, offered him hospitality, even giving him his daughter, Deipyle, to be his wife. The two were happily married and had two children together—a daughter, Comaetho, and a son, Diomedes.

Sometime later, Polynices, a banished prince of Thebes, arrived in Argos; he approached Adrastus and pleaded his case to the king, as he requested his aid to restore him to his original homeland. Adrastus promised to do so and set out to gather an expeditionary force with which to march against Thebes. This force was made up of seven individual champions, each assigned to lead an assault on one of the seven gates of the city; Tydeus, Polynices and Adrastus were among them. Together, these champions were known as the Seven against Thebes.

The expedition proved to be a complete disaster, however, as all seven of the Argive champions were killed in the ensuing battle, except for Adrastus, who escaped thanks to his horse Arion, who was the fastest of all of his brethren. Diomedes&#x27; father, Tydeus, was among those who had been slain.

Tydeus was Athena&#x27;s favorite warrior at the time, and when he was dying she wanted to offer him a magic elixir (which she had obtained from her father) that would make him immortal. However, she withdrew the intended privilege in apparent disgust when Tydeus gobbled down the brains of the hated enemy who had wounded him.

Diomedes was four years old when his father was killed. At the funeral of their fathers, the sons of the seven fallen champions (Aegialeus, Alcmaeon, Amphilocus, Diomedes, Euryalus, Promachus, Sthenelus, and Thersander) met and vowed to vanquish Thebes in order to avenge their fathers. These seven sons were known as the Epigoni (&quot;offspring&quot;).

Ten years later, the Epigoni set out to launch another expedition against Thebes, appointing Alcmaeon as their commander-in-chief. They strengthened their initial forces with contingents from Messenia, Arcadia, Corinth, and Megara. This army, however, was still small compared to that of Thebes.

The war of the Epigoni is remembered as the most important expedition in Greek mythology prior to the Trojan War. It was a favorite topic for epics; but all of these epics are now lost. The main battle took place at Glisas where Prince Aegialeus (son of Adrastus and heir to the throne) was slain by King Laodamas, who was in turn killed by Alcmaeon. With their king dead, the Thebans, believing this to be the end for them, sought counsel from the seer Tiresias, who urged them to flee the city. They did so, and, faced with no opposition, the Epigoni entered the city, plundering its treasures and tearing down its great walls. Having achieved their objective, the Epigoni returned home, but not before they installed Thersander, son of the fallen prince Polynices (the instigator of the first Theban expedition), as the city&#x27;s new ruler.

As Diomedes and the Argive forces travelled home, an elderly King Adrastus died of grief upon learning that his son Aegialeus had perished in the battle; as such, Diomedes was left as the last of Adrastus&#x27; male descendants. That being so, upon returning home to Argos, Diomedes ascended to the throne. In order to secure his grasp on the throne, Diomedes married Aegialeus&#x27; daughter, Princess Aegialia.

Diomedes ruled Argos for more than five years and brought much wealth and stability to the city during his time. He was a skilled politician and was greatly respected by other rulers. He still kept an eye on Calydonian politics (his father&#x27;s homeland), and when the sons of Agrius (led by Thersites) put Oeneus (Diomedes&#x27; grandfather) in jail and their own father on the throne, Diomedes decided to restore Oeneus to the throne.

Diomedes attacked and seized the kingdom, slaying all the traitors except Thersites, Onchestus (who escaped to Peloponnesus) and Agrius (who killed himself) restoring his grandfather to the throne. Later, Oeneus passed the kingdom to his son-in-law, Andraemon, and headed to Argos to meet Diomedes. He was assassinated on the way (in Arcadia) by Thersites and Onchestus. Unable to find the murderers, Diomedes founded a mythical city called &quot;Oenoe&quot; at the place where his grandfather was buried to honour his death. Later, Thersites fought against the Trojans in the Trojan War and noble Diomedes did not mistreat him (however, Thersites was hated by all the other Achaeans). In fact, when Thersites was brutally slain by Achilles (after having mocked him when the latter cried over Penthesilia&#x27;s dead body), Diomedes was the only person who wanted to punish Achilles.

According to Hyginus and Pseudo-Apollodorus, Diomedes became one of the suitors of Helen and, as such, he was bound by the oath of Tyndareus, which established that all the suitors would defend and protect the man who was chosen as Helen&#x27;s husband against any wrong done against him in regard to his marriage. Accordingly, when the Trojan prince Paris stole Menelaus&#x27; wife, all those who had sworn the oath were summoned by Agamemnon (Menelaus&#x27; brother), so that they would join the coalition that was to sail from Aulis to Troy in order to retrieve Helen and the Spartan property that was stolen. However, Hesiod does not include Diomedes in his list of suitors. It&#x27;s possible that labelling Diomedes a suitor of Helen was a later addition, extrapolated from his name being listed in the Catalogue of Ships. If, in fact, Helen ruled Sparta with her husband Menelaus for ten years before her abduction, Diomedes would have still been a child at the time of their marriage and thus a very unlikely suitor.

==Trojan War==
Diomedes is known primarily for his participation in the Trojan War. According to Homer, Diomedes entered the war with a fleet of 80 ships, third only to the contributions of Agamemnon (100 ships) and Nestor (90). Both Sthenelus and Euryalus (former Epigoni) fought under his command with their armies. Sthenelus was the driver of Diomedes&#x27; chariot and probably his closest friend. All the troops from Argos, Tiryns, Troezen and some other cities were headed by Diomedes.

Although he was the youngest of the Achaean kings, Diomedes is considered the most experienced leader by many scholars (he had fought more battles than others, including the war of the Epigoni, the most important war expedition before the Trojan War – even old Nestor had not participated in such military work). Second only to Achilles, Diomedes is considered to be the mightiest and the most skilled warrior among the Achaeans. He was overwhelming Telamonian Ajax in an armed sparring contest when the watching Achaeans bade the men to stop and take equal prizes because they feared for Ajax&#x27;s life. Ajax gave Diomedes the prize (long sword) because Diomedes drew the first blood. He vanquished (and could have killed) Aeneas (the second best Trojan warrior) once. He and Odysseus were the only Achaean heroes who participated in covert military operations that demanded discipline, bravery, courage, cunning, and resourcefulness.

Diomedes received the most direct divine help and protection. He was the favorite warrior of Athena (who even drove his chariot once). He was also the only hero except Heracles, son of Zeus, that attacked Olympian gods. He even wounded Ares, whom he struck with his spear. Once, he was even granted divine vision in order to identify immortals. Only Diomedes and Menelaus were offered immortality and became gods in post-Homeric mythology.

The god Hephaestus made Diomedes&#x27; cuirass for him. He was the only Achaean warrior apart from Achilles who carried such an arsenal of gear made by Hera&#x27;s son. He also had a round shield with the mark of a boar. In combat, he also carried a spear, which wasn&#x27;t enchanted as well as his father&#x27;s sword. His golden armor bore a crest of a boar on the breast. It was created by a mortal smith but was blessed by Athena, who gave it to Tydeus. When he died, it passed to Diomedes. A skilled smith created the sword for Tydeus, which bore designs of a lion and a big boar.

===In Aulis===
In Aulis, where the Achaean leaders gathered, Diomedes met his brother in arms Odysseus, with whom he shared several adventures. Both of them were favorite heroes of Athena and each shared characteristics of their patron goddess – Odysseus her wisdom and cunning, and Diomedes her courage and skill in battle; though neither was wholly bereft of either aspect. They began to combine their efforts and actions already when being in Aulis.
When the sacrifice of Iphigenia (Agamemnon&#x27;s daughter) became a necessity for the Achaeans to sail away from Aulis, King Agamemnon had to choose between sacrificing his daughter and resigning from his post of high commander among Achaeans. When he decided to sacrifice his daughter to Artemis, Odysseus carried out this order of Agamemnon by luring Iphigenia from Mycenae to Aulis, where murder, disguised as wedding, awaited her. According to Hyginus, Diomedes went with Odysseus to fetch Iphigenia, making this the two companions&#x27; first mission together. However, Pseudo-Apollodorus has Agamemnon send Odysseus and Talthybius instead. According to Euripides, neither of the two went to fetch Iphigenia, though he calls the plan Odysseus&#x27; idea in &quot;Iphigenia at Tauris&quot;.

===Palamedes===
Once in Troy, Odysseus murdered Palamedes (the commander who outwitted Odysseus in Ithaca, proving him to be feigning insanity and thus forcing him to stand by his oath and join the alliance), drowning him while he was fishing. According to other stories, when Palamedes advised the Achaeans to return home, Odysseus accused him of being a traitor and forged false evidence and found a fake witness to testify against him, whereupon Palamedes was stoned to death.

Some say that both Diomedes and Odysseus drowned Palamedes. Another version says that he conspired with Odysseus against Palamedes, and under the pretence of having discovered a hidden treasure, they let him down into a well and there stoned him to death. Others say that, though Diomedes guessed or knew about the plot, he did not try to defend Palamedes, because Odysseus was essential for the fall of Troy.

===In the &quot;Iliad&quot;===

Diomedes is one of the main characters in the &quot;Iliad&quot;. This epic narrates a series of events that took place during the final year of the great war. Diomedes is the key fighter in the first third of the epic. According to some interpretations, Diomedes is represented in the epic as the most valiant soldier of the war, who avoids committing hubris. He is regarded as the perfect embodiment of traditional heroic values. While striving to become the best warrior and attain honor and glory, he does not succumb to the madness which &#x27;menos&#x27; might entail.

He was the only human except for Heracles to be granted strength (with permission) to directly fight with immortals themselves and injures two Olympian immortals (both Ares and Aphrodite) in a single day. However, he still displays self-restraint and humility to retreat before Ares and give way to Apollo thus remaining within mortal limits. This is in contrast to Patroclus (who does not give way when opposed by Apollo) and Achilles (who resorts to fight the river Scamander on his own).

His character also helps to establish one of the main themes of the epic: how human choices and efforts become insignificant when fate and immortals are in control. Diomedes follows Homeric tradition closely and having absolute faith on the superiority of fate, he predicts the conclusion of Achilles&#x27; efforts to go against fate.

Apart from his outstanding fighting abilities and courage, Diomedes is on several crucial occasions shown to possess great wisdom, which is acknowledged and respected by his much older comrades, including Agamemnon and Nestor. Diomedes, Nestor and Odysseus were some of the greatest Achaean strategists. Throughout the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Diomedes and Nestor are frequently seen speaking first in war-counsel.

Instances of Diomedes&#x27; maturity and intelligence as described in parts of the epic:

*In Book IV Agamemnon taunts Diomedes by calling him a far inferior fighter compared to his father. His enraged comrade Sthenelus urges Diomedes to stand up to Agamemnon by responding that he has bested his father and avenged his death by conquering Thebes. Diomedes responded that it was part of Agamemnon&#x27;s tasks as a leader to urge forward the Achaean soldiers, and that men of valour should have no problem withstanding such insults. However, when Agamemnon earlier uses the same kind of taunting on Odysseus, he responds with anger.
*Although Diomedes dismissed Agamemnon&#x27;s taunting with respect, he did not hesitate to point out Agamemnon&#x27;s inadequacy as a leader in certain crucial situations. In Book IX, Agamemnon proposes going back to Hellas because Zeus has turned against them. Diomedes then reminds him of the previous insult and tells him that his behavior is not proper for a leader. Achaean council – Book IX
*Diomedes points out that because Troy is destined to fall, they should continue fighting regardless of Zeus&#x27; interventions. Fate and gods were with Achaeans at the start and therefore Zeus&#x27; interventions could only be temporary. Even if all other Achaeans lost their faith and went home, he and Sthenelus would still remain and continue to fight till Troy was sacked.
*&quot;The sons of the Achaeans shouted applause at the words of Diomedes, and presently Nestor rose to speak. &#x27;Son of Tydeus,&#x27; said he, &#x27;in war your prowess is beyond question, and in council you excel all who are of your own years; no one of the Achaeans can make light of what you say nor gainsay it, but you have not yet come to the end of the whole matter. You are still young—you might be the youngest of my own children—still you have spoken wisely and have counselled the chief of the Achaeans not without discretion;&#x27;&quot; Achaean council – Book IX
*When Agamemnon tried to appease Achilles&#x27;s wrath so that he would fight again, by offering him many gifts, Nestor appointed three envoys to meet Achilles (Book IX). They had to return empty handed; Achilles had told them that he will leave Troy and never return. The Achaeans were devastated at this. Diomedes points out the folly of offering these gifts which ultimately served only to encourage Achilles&#x27; pride to the level that he now wishes to defy fate. Diomedes then makes a prediction (based on Homeric tradition) that eventually becomes true. He says that even if Achilles somehow manages to leave Troy, he will never be able to stay away from battle because human efforts and choice cannot defy fate; &quot;let him go or stay—the gods will make sure that he will fight.&quot; In Book XV, Zeus says to Hera that he had already made a plan to make sure that Achilles will eventually enter the battle.
*Diomedes also encourages Agamemnon to take the lead of next day&#x27;s battle. &quot;But when fair rosy-fingered morn appears, forthwith bring out your host and your horsemen in front of the ships, urging them on, and yourself fighting among the foremost.&quot; (Book IX) Agamemnon accepts this counsel and the next day&#x27;s battle starts with his &quot;aristeia&quot; where he becomes the hero of the day.

Diomedes&#x27; aristeia (&quot;excellence&quot;—the great deeds of a hero) begins in Book V and continues in Book VI. This is the longest aristeia in the epic. Some scholars claim that this part of the epic was originally a separate, independent poem (describing the feats of Diomedes) that Homer adapted and included in the &quot;Iliad&quot;. Diomedes&#x27; aristeia represents many of his heroic virtues such as outstanding fighting skills, bravery, divine protection/advice, carefully planned tactics of war, leadership, humility and self-restraint.

====Book V====
Book V begins with Athena, the war-like goddess of wisdom putting valour into the heart of her champion warrior. She also makes a stream of fire flare from his shield and helmet. Diomedes then slays a number of Trojan warriors including Phegeus (whose brother was spirited away by Hera&#x27;s son, Hephaestus before being slain by Diomedes) until Pandarus wounds him with an arrow. Diomedes then prays to Athena for the slaughter of Pandarus. She responds by offering him a special vision to distinguish gods from men and asks him to wound Aphrodite if she ever comes to battle. She also warns him not to engage any other god.

He continues to make havoc among the Trojans by killing Astynous, Hypeiron, Abas, Polyidus, Xanthus, Thoon, Echemmon and Chromius (two sons of Priam). Finally, Aeneas (son of Aphrodite) asks Pandarus to mount his chariot so that they may fight Diomedes together. Sthenelus warns his friend of their approach.

Diomedes faces this situation by displaying both his might and wisdom. Although he can face both of these warriors together, he knows that Aphrodite may try to save her son, Aeneas. He also knows the history of Aeneas&#x27; two horses (they descend from immortal steeds that Zeus had once given King Tros, original founder of Troy). Since he has to carry out Athena&#x27;s order, he orders Sthenelus to steal the horses while he faces Aeneas.
Pandarus throws his spear mistakenly thinking he mortally wounds Diomedes. Diomedes returns the blow by throwing his spear at a bragging Pandarus, killing him instantly. Aeneas is left to fight against a now unarmed Diomedes, who picks up a huge stone and crushes Aeneas&#x27; hip with it. Fainting, Aeneas&#x27; mother protects him with her garment as Diomedes&#x27; comrade Sthenelus springs Aeneas&#x27; horses free from the Trojans and taken by Deipylus to their ships. Aphrodite drops her son, Aeneas, while under attack by Diomedes, who is following Athena&#x27;s orders. Apollo comes to the rescue of Aeneas and sends the wounded Aphrodite fleeing back to Olympus. Disregarding Athena&#x27;s advice, Diomedes attacks Apollo three times before he warns him not to match himself against immortals. Diomedes then withdraws from combat having failed to kill Aeneas, but succeeding in obtaining what he considers to be the finest steeds alive (and later in Book XXIII, winner of the chariot race for Patroclus, despite starting in last place). 

Aphrodite complained to her mother about Diomedes&#x27; handiwork. The latter reminded her of mighty Heracles (now, an Olympian himself) who held the record of wounding not one but two Olympians as a human.

The transgression of Diomedes by attacking Apollo had its consequences. Urged by Apollo, Ares came to the battlefield to help Trojans. Identifying the god of war, Diomedes protected the Achaeans by ordering them to withdraw towards their ships. Hera saw the havoc created by her son and together with Athena, she came to the Achaeans&#x27; aid. When Athena saw Diomedes resting near his horses, she mocked him, reminding him of Tydeus who frequently disobeyed her advice. Diomedes replied, &quot;Goddess, I know you truly and will not hide anything from you. I am following your instructions and retreating for I know that Ares is fighting among the Trojans&quot;. Athena answered &quot;Diomedes most dear to my heart, do not fear this immortal or any other god for I will protect you.&quot; Throwing Sthenelus out of the chariot and mounting it herself, the goddess (who invented the chariot and taught humans to drive it) drove straight at Ares. She also put on the helmet of Hades, making her invisible to even gods. Ares saw only Diomedes in the chariot and threw his spear which was caught by Athena. Diomedes then threw his spear (which was guided by Athena) at Ares, wounding his stomach. The god screamed in a voice of ten thousand men and fled away. This was how Diomedes became the only human to wound two Olympians in a single day.

====Book VI====
Diomedes continued his feats by killing Axylus and Calesius. Hector&#x27;s brother Helenus described Diomedes&#x27; fighting skills in this manner: &quot;He fights with fury and fills men&#x27;s souls with panic. I hold him mightiest of them all; we did not fear even their great champion Achilles, son of an immortal though he be, as we do this man: his rage is beyond all bounds, and there is none can vie with him in prowess.&quot;

Helenus then sent Hector to the city of Troy to tell their mother about what was happening. According to the instructions of Helenus, Priam&#x27;s wife gathered matrons at the temple of Athena in the acropolis and offered the goddess the largest, fairest robe of Troy. She also promised the sacrifice of twelve heifers if Athena could take pity on them and break the spear of Diomedes. Athena, of course, did not grant it.
Meanwhile, one brave Trojan named Glaucus challenged the son of Tydeus to a single combat. Impressed by his bravery and noble appearance, Diomedes inquired if he were an immortal in disguise. Although Athena has previously told him not to fear any immortal, Diomedes displayed his humility by saying, &quot;I will not fight any more immortals.&quot;

Glaucus told the story of how he was descended from Bellerophon who killed the Chimaera and the Amazons. Diomedes realized that his grandfather Oeneus hosted Bellerophon, and so Diomedes and Glaucus must also be friends. They resolved to not fight each other and Diomedes proposed exchanging their armours. Cunning Diomedes only gave away a bronze armour for the golden one he received. The phrase &#x27;Diomedian swap&#x27; originated from this incident.

====Book VII====
Diomedes was among the nine Achaean warriors who came forward to fight Hector in a single combat. When they cast lots to choose one among those warriors, the Achaeans prayed &quot;Father Zeus, grant that the lot fall on Ajax, or on the son of Tydeus, or upon Agamemnon.&quot; Ajax was chosen to fight Hector.

Idaeus of the Trojans came for a peace negotiation, and he offered to give back all the treasures Paris stole plus more—everything except Helen. In the Achaean council, Diomedes was the first one to speak: &quot;Let there be no taking, neither treasure, nor yet Helen, for even a child may see that the doom of the Trojans is at hand.&quot; These words were applauded by all and Agamemnon said, &quot;This is the answer of the Achaeans.&quot;

====Book VIII====
Zeus ordered all other deities to not interfere with the battle. He made the Trojans stronger so they could drive away the Achaeans from battle. Then he thundered aloud from Ida and sent the glare of his lightning upon the Achaeans. Seeing this, all the great Achaean warriors—including the two Ajaxes, Agamemnon, Idomeneus and Odysseus—took flight. Nestor could not escape because one of his horses was wounded by Paris&#x27; arrow. He might have perished if not for Diomedes.

This incident is the best example for Diomedes&#x27; remarkable bravery. Seeing that Nestor&#x27;s life was in danger, the son of Tydeus shouted for Odysseus&#x27; help. The latter ignored his cry and ran away. Left alone in the battleground, Diomedes took his stand before Nestor and ordered him to take Sthenelus&#x27; place. Having Nestor as the driver, Diomedes bravely rushed towards Hector. Struck by his spear, Hector&#x27;s driver Eniopeus was slain. Taking a new driver, Archeptolemus, Hector advanced forward again. Zeus saw that both Hector and Archeptolemus were about to be slain by Diomedes and decided to intervene. He took his mighty Thunderbolt and shot its lightning in front of Diomedes&#x27; chariot. Nestor advised Diomedes to turn back since no person should try to transgress Zeus&#x27; will. Diomedes answered, &quot;Hector will talk among the Trojans and say, &#x27;The son of Tydeus fled before me to the ships.&#x27; This is the vaunt he will make, and may the earth then swallow me.&quot; Nestor responded, &quot;Son of Tydeus, though Hector say that you are a coward the Trojans and Dardanians will not believe him, nor yet the wives of the mighty warriors whom you have laid low.&quot; Saying these words, Nestor turned the horses back. Hector, seeing that they had turned back from battle, called Diomedes a &quot;woman and a coward&quot; and promised to slay him personally. Diomedes thought three times of turning back and fighting Hector, but Zeus thundered from heaven each time.

When all the Achaean seemed discouraged, Zeus sent an eagle as a good omen. Diomedes was the first warrior to read this omen, and he immediately attacked the Trojans and killed Agelaus.

At the end of the day&#x27;s battle, Hector made one more boast, &quot;Let the women each of them light a great fire in her house, and let watch be safely kept lest the town be entered by surprise while the host is outside... I shall then know whether brave Diomed will drive me back from the ships to the wall, or whether I shall myself slay him and carry off his bloodstained spoils. Tomorrow let him show his mettle, abide my spear if he dare. I ween that at break of day, he shall be among the first to fall and many another of his comrades round him. Would that I were as sure of being immortal and never growing old, and of being worshipped like Athena and Apollo, as I am that this day will bring evil to the Argives.&quot;

These words subsequently turned out to be wrong. In spite of careful watch, Diomedes managed to launch an attack upon the sleeping Trojans. Hector was vanquished by Diomedes yet again and it was Diomedes that ended up being worshipped as an immortal.

====Book IX====
Agamemnon started shedding tears and proposed to abandon the war for good because Zeus was supporting the Trojans. Diomedes pointed out that this behavior was inappropriate for a leader like Agamemnon. He also declared that he will never leave the city unvanquished for the gods were originally with them. This speech signifies the nature of Homeric tradition where fate and divine interventions have superiority over human choices. Diomedes believed that Troy was fated to fall and had absolute and unconditional faith in victory.

However, this was one of the two instances where Diomedes&#x27; opinion was criticized by Nestor. He praised Diomedes&#x27; intelligence and declared that no person of such young age could equal Diomedes in counsel. He then criticized Diomedes for not making any positive proposal to replace Agamemnon&#x27;s opinion – a failure which Nestor ascribed to his youth. Nestor believed in the importance of human choices and proposed to change Achilles&#x27; mind by offering many gifts. This proposal was approved by both Agamemnon and Odysseus.

The embassy failed because Achilles himself had more faith in his own choices than fate or divine interventions. He threatened to leave Troy, never to return believing that this choice will enable him to live a long life. When the envoys returned, Diomedes criticized Nestor&#x27;s decision and Achilles&#x27; pride saying that Achilles&#x27; personal choice of leaving Troy is of no importance (therefore, trying to change it with gifts is useless). Diomedes said, &quot;Let Achilles stay or leave if he wishes to, but he will fight when the time comes. Let&#x27;s leave it to the gods to set his mind on that.&quot; (In Book 15, Zeus tells Hera that he has already planned the method of bringing Achilles back to battle, confirming that Diomedes was right all along)

====Book X====
Agamemnon and Menelaus rounded up their principal commanders to get ready for battle the next day. They woke up Odysseus, Nestor, Ajax, Diomedes and Idomeneus. While the others were sleeping inside their tents, king Diomedes was seen outside his tent clad in his armour sleeping upon an ox skin, already well-prepared for any problem he may encounter at night. During the Achaean council held, Agamemnon asked for a volunteer to spy on the Trojans. Again, it was Diomedes who stepped forward.

The son of Tydeus explained &quot;If another will go with me, I could do this in greater confidence and comfort. When two men are together, one of them may see some opportunity which the other has not caught sight of; if a man is alone he is less full of resource, and his wit is weaker.&quot; These words inspired many other heroes to step forward. Agamemnon put Diomedes in charge of the mission and asked him to choose a companion himself. The hero instantly selected Odysseus for he was loved by Athena and was quick witted. Although Odysseus had deserted Diomedes in the battlefield that very day, instead of criticizing him, the latter praised his bravery in front of others. 

Meanwhile, in a similar council held by Hector, not a single prince or king would volunteer to spy on Achaeans. Finally Hector managed to send Dolon, a good runner, after making a false oath (promising him Achilles&#x27; horses after the victory).

On their way to the Trojan camp, Diomedes and Odysseus discovered Dolon approaching the Achaean camp. The two kings lay among the corpses till Dolon passed them and ran after him. Dolon proved to be the better runner but Athena infused fresh strength into the son of Tydeus for she feared some other Achaean might earn the glory of being first to hit Dolon. Diomedes threw his spear over Dolon&#x27;s shoulders and ordered him to stop.

Dolon gave them several valuable pieces of information. According to Dolon, Hector and the other councilors were holding conference by the monument of great Ilus, away from the general tumult. In addition, he told about a major weakness in the Trojan army. Only the Trojans had watchfires; they, therefore, were awake and kept each other to their duty as sentinels; but the allies who have come from other places were asleep and left it to the Trojans to keep guard. It is never explained in the epic why Dolon, specially mentioned as a man of lesser intelligence, came to notice this flaw while Hector (in spite of all his boasting) completely missed/ignored it.

On further questioning, Diomedes and Odysseus learnt that among the various allies, Thracians were the most vulnerable for they had come last and were sleeping apart from the others at the far end of the camp. Rhesus was their king and Dolon described Rhesus&#x27; horses in this manner; &quot;His horses are the finest and strongest that I have ever seen, they are whiter than snow and fleeter than any wind that blows&quot;.

Having truthfully revealed valuable things, Dolon expected to be taken as a prisoner to the ships, or to be tied up, while the other two found out whether he had told them the truth or not. But Diomedes told him: &quot;You have given us excellent news, but do not imagine you are going to get away, now that you have fallen into our hands. If we set you free tonight, there is nothing to prevent your coming down once more to the Achaean ships, either to play the spy or to meet us in open fight. But if I lay my hands on you and take your life, you will never be a nuisance to the Argives again.&quot; Having said this, Diomedes cut off the prisoner&#x27;s head with his sword, without giving him time to plead for his life.
Although the original purpose of this night mission was spying on the Trojans, the information given by Dolon persuaded the two friends to plan an attack upon the Thracians. They took the spoils and set them upon a tamarisk tree in honour of Athena. Then they went where Dolon had indicated, and having found the Thracian king, Diomedes let him and twelve of his soldiers pass from one kind of sleep to another; for they were all killed in their beds, while asleep. Meanwhile, Odysseus gathered the team of Rhesus&#x27; horses. Diomedes was wondering when to stop. He was planning to kill more Thracians and steal the chariot of the king with his armour when Athena advised him to retire, lest some other god might warn the Trojans.

This first night mission demonstrates another side of these two kings where they employed stealth and treachery along with might and bravery. In Book XIII, Idomeneus praises Meriones and claims the best warriors do in fact excel in both types of warfare, &#x27;lokhos&#x27; (ambush) and &#x27;polemos&#x27; (open battle). Idomeneus&#x27; words portray ambush, &quot;the place where the merit of men most shines through, where the coward and the resolute man are revealed&quot;, as a type of warfare only for the bravest.

The first night mission also fulfills one of the prophecies required for the fall of Troy: that Troy will not fall while the horses of Rhesus feed upon its plains. According to another version of the story, it had been foretold by an oracle that if the stallions of Rhesus were ever to drink from the river Scamander, which cuts across the Trojan plain, then the city of Troy would never fall. The Achaeans never allowed the horses to drink from that river for all of them were stolen by Diomedes and Odysseus shortly after their arrival. In a different story (attributed to Pindar), Rhesus fights so well against the Achaeans that Hera sends Odysseus and Diomedes to kill him secretly at night. Another version (Virgil and Servius) says that Rhesus was given an oracle that claims he will be invincible after he and his horses drink from the Scamander. In all these versions, killing Rhesus by Diomedes was instrumental for the victory. The horses of Rhesus were given to king Diomedes.

According to some scholars, the remaining Thracians, deprived of their king, left Troy to return to their kingdom. This was another outcome of the night mission favorable to the Achaeans.

====Book XI====
In the forenoon, the fight was equal, but Agamemnon turned the fortune of the day towards the Achaeans until he was wounded and left the field. Hector then seized the battlefield and slew many Achaeans. Beholding this, Diomedes and Odysseus continued to fight with much valor, giving hope to the Achaeans. The king of Argos slew Thymbraeus, two sons of Merops, and Agastrophus.

Hector soon marked the havoc Diomedes and Odysseus were making, and approached them. Diomedes immediately threw his spear at Hector, aiming for his head. This throw was accurate but the helmet given by Apollo saved Hector&#x27;s life. Yet, the spear was sent with such great force that Hector swooned away. Meanwhile, Diomedes ran towards Hector to get his spear. Hector recovered and mingled with the crowd, by which means he saved his life from Diomedes for the second time. Frustrated, Diomedes shouted after Hector, calling him a dog. The son of Tydeus, frequently referred to as the lord of war cry, had not been seen speaking disrespectful words to his enemies before.

Shortly afterwards Paris jumped up in joy for he managed to achieve a great feat by fixing Diomedes&#x27; foot to the ground with an arrow. Dismayed at this, Diomedes said &quot;Seducer, a worthless coward like you can inflict but a light wound; when I wound a man though I but graze his skin it is another matter, for my weapon will lay him low. His wife will tear her cheeks for grief and his children will be fatherless: there will he rot, reddening the earth with his blood, and vultures, not women, will gather round him.&quot; Under Odysseus&#x27; cover, Diomedes withdrew the arrow but unable to fight with a limp, he retired from battle.

====Book XIV====
The wounded kings (Diomedes, Agamemnon and Odysseus) held council with Nestor regarding the possibility of the Trojan army reaching their ships. Agamemnon proposed drawing the ships on the beach into the water but Odysseus rebuked him and pointed out the folly of such council. Agamemnon said, &quot;Someone, it may be, old or young, can offer us better counsel which I shall rejoice to hear.&quot; Wise Diomedes said, &quot;Such a one is at hand; he is not far to seek, if you will listen to me and not resent my speaking though I am younger than any of you ... I say, then, let us go to the fight as we needs must, wounded though we be. When there, we may keep out of the battle and beyond the range of the spears lest we get fresh wounds in addition to what we have already, but we can spur on others, who have been indulging their spleen and holding aloof from battle hitherto.&quot; This council was approved by all.

====Book XXIII====
In the funeral games of Patroclus, Diomedes (though wounded) wins all the games he plays. First, he participates in the chariot race where he had to take the last place in the starting-line (chosen by casting lots). Achilles explains that his immortal steed, originally a gift of Poseidon to his father, excels all others, and although would win, his horses are weeping the death of their driver Patroclus rather than racing. A warrior named Eumelus takes the lead. Diomedes cannot overtake him as expected because Apollo, out of spite, makes him drop his whip. Seeing this, Athena gives the whip back to Diomedes and puts fresh strength into the horses while breaking the yoke of Eumelus, who gets thrown off and injured. Antilochus tells his horses there is no point trying to overtake Diomedes due to Athena wishing his victory. Diomedes does win, with his famed Trojan horses, taken from Aeneas in Book V, where it had been revealed they were descendants of the horses given by Zeus to King Tros, original founder of the Trojans, and are the finest that live. Diomedes first place prize is, &quot;a woman skilled in all useful arts, and a three-legged cauldron&quot;. The chariot race is considered as the most prestigious competition in the funeral games and the most formal occasion for validating the status of the elite. In this way Diomedes asserts his status as the foremost Achaean hero after Achilles.

Next, he fought with great Ajax in an armed sparring contest where the winner was to draw blood first. Ajax attacked Diomedes where his armour covered his body and achieved no success. Ajax owned the biggest armour and the tallest shield which covered most of his body leaving only two places vulnerable; his neck and armpits. So, Diomedes maneuvered his spear above Ajax&#x27;s shield and attacked his neck, drawing blood. The Achaean leaders were scared that another such blow would kill Ajax and they stopped the fight. Diomedes received the prize for the victor. This is the final appearance of Diomedes in the epic.

====Role as Athena&#x27;s favored warrior====
It is generally accepted that Athena is closest to Diomedes in the epic. For example, although both Odysseus and Diomedes were favorites of the goddess Athena, Odysseus prayed for help even before the start of the above footrace, whereas Diomedes received Athena&#x27;s help without having to ask. Moreover, the goddess spoke to the hero without any disguise in Book V where he could see her in the true divine form (a special vision was granted to him). Such an incident doesn&#x27;t happen even in the other Homeric epic, &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, where Athena always appears to Odysseus in disguise.

===Posthomerica===
Penthesileia led a small army of Amazons to Troy for the last year of the Trojan War. Two of her warriors, named Alcibie and Derimacheia, were slain by Diomedes. Penthesileia killed many Achaeans in battle. She was, however, no match for Achilles, who killed her. When Achilles stripped Penthesileia of her armour, he saw that the woman was young and very beautiful, and seemingly falls madly in love with her. Achilles then regrets killing her. Thersites mocked Achilles for his behaviour, because the hero was mourning his enemy. Enraged, Achilles killed Thersites with a single blow to his face.

Thersites was so quarrelsome and abusive in character that only his cousin, Diomedes, mourned for him. Diomedes wanted to avenge Thersites, but the other leaders persuaded the two mightiest Achaean warriors against fighting each other. Hearkening to prayers of comrades, the two heroes reconciled at last. According to Quintus Smyrnaeus, the Achaean leaders agreed to the boon of returning her body to the Trojans for her funeral pyre. According to some other sources, Diomedes angrily tossed Penthesileia&#x27;s body into the river, so neither side could give her decent burial.

Nestor&#x27;s son was killed by Memnon, and Achilles held funeral games for Antilochus. Diomedes won the sprint. After Achilles&#x27; death, the Achaeans piled him a mound and held magnificent games in his honor. According to Apollodorus, Diomedes won the footrace. Quintus of Smyrna says that the wrestling match between him and Ajax the Great came to a draw. After the death of Achilles, it was prophesied that Troy could not be taken if Neoptolemus (Achilles&#x27;s son) would not come and fight. According to Quintus Smyrnaeus, Odysseus and Diomedes came to Scyros to bring him to the war at Troy. According to the Epic Cycle, Odysseus and Phoenix did this.

The Achaean seer Calchas prophesied that Philoctetes (whom the Achaeans had abandoned on the island of Lemnos due to the vile odour from snakebite) and the bow of Heracles are needed to take Troy. Philoctetes hated Odysseus, Agamemnon and Menelaus, because they were responsible for leaving him behind. Diomedes and Odysseus were charged with achieving this prophecy also. Knowing that Philoctetes would never agree to come with them, they sailed to the island and stole the bow of Heracles by a trick. According to the &quot;Little Iliad&quot;, Odysseus wanted to sail home with the bow but Diomedes refused to leave Philoctetes behind. Heracles (now a god) or Athena then persuaded Philoctetes to join the Achaeans again (with the promise that he would be healed) and he agreed to go with Diomedes. The bow of Heracles and the poisoned arrows were used by Philoctetes to slay Paris; this was a requirement to the fall of Troy.

According to some, Diomedes and Odysseus were sent into the city of Troy to negotiate for peace after the death of Paris.

===The Palladium===

After Paris&#x27; death, Helenus left the city but was captured by Odysseus. The Achaeans somehow managed to persuade the seer/warrior to reveal the weakness of Troy. The Achaeans learnt from Helenus, that Troy would not fall as long as the Palladium (an image or statue of Athena) remained within Troy&#x27;s walls. The difficult task of stealing this sacred statue again fell upon the shoulders of Odysseus and Diomedes.

Odysseus, some say, went by night to Troy; leaving Diomedes waiting, he entered the city disguised as a beggar. There he was recognized by Helen, who told him where the Palladium was. Diomedes then climbed the wall of Troy and entered the city. Together, the two friends killed several guards and one or more priests of Athena&#x27;s temple and stole the Palladium &quot;with their bloodstained hands&quot;. Diomedes is generally regarded as the person who physically removed the Palladium and carried it away to the ships.

According to the &quot;Little Iliad&quot;, on the way to the ships, Odysseus plotted to kill Diomedes and claim the Palladium (or perhaps the credit for gaining it) for himself. He raised his sword to stab Diomedes in the back. Diomedes was alerted to the danger by glimpsing the gleam of the sword in the moonlight. He turned round, seized the sword of Odysseus, tied his hands, and drove him along in front, beating his back with the flat of his sword. Because Odysseus was essential for the destruction of Troy, Diomedes refrained from killing him. From this action arose the Greek proverbial expression &quot;Diomedes&#x27; necessity&quot;, applied to those who act contrary to their inclination for the greater good. (This scene was depicted in an 1842 sculpture in plaster by the French sculptor Pierre-Jules Cavelier.)

Diomedes took the Palladium with him when he left Troy. According to Plutarch, he brought it to Argos, where it remained until Ergiaeus, one of his descendants, took it away to Sparta with the assistance of the Laconian Leagrus. Others say that Diomedes brought it to Italy. Pausanias says that Diomedes was robbed of the palladium by Demophon in Attica, where he landed one night on his return from Troy, without knowing where he was. According to another tradition, the Palladium failed to bring Diomedes any luck due to the unrighteous way he obtained it. He was informed by an oracle that he should be exposed to unceasing sufferings unless he restored the sacred image to the Trojans. Therefore he restored it to his enemy Aeneas.
===The Wooden Horse===
This stratagem invented by Odysseus made it possible to take the city. Diomedes was one of the warriors inside. He slew many Trojan warriors inside the city.

According to Quintus Smyrnaeus, while slaughtering countless Trojans, Diomedes met an elderly man named Ilioneus who begged for mercy. Despite his fury of war, Diomedes held back his sword so that the old man might speak. Ilioneus begged &quot;Oh compassionate my suppliant hands! To slay the young and valiant is a glorious thing; but if you smite an old man, small renown waits on your prowess. Therefore turn from me your hands against young men, if you hope ever to come to grey hairs such as mine.&quot; Firmly resolved in his purpose, Diomedes answered. &quot;Old man, I look to attain to honored age; but while my Strength yet exists, not a single foe will escape me with life. The brave man makes an end of every foe.&quot; Having said this, Diomedes slew Ilioneus.

Some of the other Trojan warriors slain by Diomedes during that night were Coroebus who came to Troy to win the hand of Cassandra, Eurydamas and Eurycoon. Cypria says that Polyxena died after being wounded by Odysseus and Diomedes in the capture of the city.

==After the Trojan War==

===After the fall of Troy===
During the sacking and looting of the great city, the seeress Cassandra, daughter of Priam and Hecuba, clung to the statue of Athena, but the Lesser Ajax raped her. Odysseus, unsuccessfully, tried to persuade the Achaean leaders to put Ajax to death, by stoning the Locrian leader (to divert the goddess&#x27;s anger). The other Achaean leaders disagreed because Ajax himself clung to the same statue of Athena in order to save himself. The failure of Achaean leaders to punish Ajax the Lesser for the sacrilege of Athena&#x27;s altar resulted in earning her wrath.

Athena caused a quarrel between Agamemnon and Menelaus about the voyage from Troy. Agamemnon then stayed on to appease the anger of Athena. Diomedes and Nestor held a discussion about the situation and decided to leave immediately. They took their vast armies and left Troy. They managed to reach home safely but Athena called upon Poseidon to bring a violent storm upon most of the other Achaean ships. Diomedes is one of the few Achaean commanders to return home safely, arriving in Argos only four days after his departure from Troy. Since the other Achaeans suffered during their respective &#x27;nostoi&#x27; (Returns) because they committed an atrocity of some kind, Diomedes&#x27; safe nostos implies that he had the favour of the gods during his journey.

The Palamedes affair haunted several Achaean leaders including Diomedes. Palamedes&#x27;s brother Oeax went to Argos and reported to Aegialia, falsely or not, that her husband was bringing a woman he preferred to his wife. Others say that Aegialia herself had taken a lover, Cometes (son of Sthenelus), being persuaded to do so by Palamedes&#x27;s father Nauplius. Still others say that despite Diomedes&#x27;s noble treatment of her son Aeneas, Aphrodite never managed to forget about the Argive spear that had once pierced her flesh in the fields of Troy. She helped Aegialia to obtain not one, but many lovers. (According to different traditions, Aegialia was living in adultery with Hippolytus, Cometes or Cyllabarus.)

In any case Aegialia, being helped by the Argives, prevented Diomedes from entering the city. Or else, if he ever entered Argos, he had to take sanctuary at the altar of Hera, and thence flee with his companions by night. Cometes was shortly the king of Argos, in Diomedes&#x27; absence, but was quickly replaced by the rightful heir, Cyanippus, who was the son of Aegialeus.

===Life in Italy===
Diomedes then migrated to Aetolia, and thence to Daunia (Apulia) in Italy. He went to the court of King Daunus, King of the Daunians. The king was honored to accept the great warrior. He begged Diomedes for help in warring against the Messapians, for a share of the land and marriage to his daughter. Diomedes agreed to the proposal, drew up his men and routed the Messapians. He took his land which he assigned to the Dorians, his followers. The two nations &#x27;Monadi&#x27; and the &#x27;Dardi&#x27; were vanquished by Diomedes along with the two cities of &#x27;Apina&#x27; and &#x27;Trica&#x27;.

Diomedes later married Daunus&#x27;s daughter Euippe and had two sons named Diomedes and Amphinomus. Some say that, after the sack of Troy, Diomedes came to Libya (due to a storm), where he was put in prison by King Lycus (who planned on sacrificing him to Ares). It is said that it was the king&#x27;s daughter Callirrhoe, loosing Diomedes from his bonds, saved him. Diomedes is said to have sailed away without the least acknowledgment of the girl&#x27;s kindly deed, whereupon she killed herself, out of grief, with a halter.

===Cities founded by Diomedes===
The Greeks and Romans credited Diomedes with the foundation of several Greek settlements in Magna Graeca in southern Italy: Argyrippa or Arpi, Aequum Tuticum (Ariano Irpino), Beneventum (Benevento), Brundusium (Brindisi), Canusium (Canosa), Venafrum (Venafro), Salapia, Spina, Garganum, Sipus (near Santa Maria di Siponto), Histonium (Vasto), and Aphrodisia or Venusia (Venosa). The last was made as a peace-offering to the goddess, including temples in her honor.

Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; describes the beauty and prosperity of Diomedes&#x27; kingdom. When war broke out between Aeneas and Turnus, Turnus tried to persuade Diomedes to aid them in the war against the Trojans. Diomedes told them he had fought enough Trojans in his lifetime and urged Turnus that it was best to make peace with Aeneas than to fight the Trojans. He also said that his purpose in Italy is to live in peace. Venulus, one of Latinus&#x27; messengers, recalls the mission to Diomedes after they seek his help in the war against the Rutulians. He states that when he found Diomedes, he was laying the foundations of his new city, Argyrippa. Diomedes eventually speaks and states that, as punishment for his involvement at Troy, he never reached his fatherland of Argos and that he never saw his beloved wife again. The hero also states that birds pursue him and his soldiers, birds which used to be his companions and cry out everywhere they land, including the sea cliffs. Ovid, on the other hand, writes that Venulus came to the home of exiled Diomedes in vain, but he was erecting walls with the favour of Iapygian Daunus, his new father-in-law, which would make the city Luceria, not Argyrippa.

The worship and service of gods and heroes was spread by Diomedes far and wide: in and near Argos he caused temples of Athena to be built. His armour was preserved in a temple of Athena at Luceria in Apulia, and a gold chain of his was shown in a temple of Artemis in Peucetia. At Troezene he had founded a temple of Apollo Epibaterius and instituted the Pythian games there. Other sources claim that Diomedes had one more meeting with his old enemy Aeneas where he gave the Palladium back to the Trojans.

===Hero cult of Diomedes===
Hero cults became much more commonplace from the beginning of the 8th century BCE onwards, and they were widespread throughout several Greek cities in the Mediterranean by the last quarter of the century. Diomedes&#x27; cults were situated predominantly in Cyprus, Metapontum, and other cities on the coast of the Adriatic sea (The archaeological evidence for the hero cult of Diomedes comes mostly from this area). There are also vestiges of this cult in areas like Cyprus and some mainland Greek cities, given the inscriptions on votive offerings found in temples and tombs, but the popularity is most evident along the Eastern coast of Italy. This cult reached so far East in the Mediterranean due to the Achaean migration during the 8th century. The most distinct votive offerings to the hero were actually found within the island of Palagruža on the Adriatic.

Strabo claims that the votive offerings in the Daunian temple of Athena at Luceria contained votive offerings specifically addressing Diomedes.

Diomedes was worshipped as a hero not only in Greece, but on the coast of the Adriatic, as at Thurii and Metapontum. At Argos, his native place, during the festival of Athena, his shield was carried through the streets as a relic, together with the Palladium, and his statue was washed in the river Inachus.

There were two islands named after the hero, Islands of Diomedes, believed to be in the Palagruža archipelago on the Adriatic. Strabo mentions that one was uninhabited. A passage in Aelian&#x27;s On Animals explains the significance of this island and the mysterious birds which inhabit it. Strabo reflects on the peculiarities of this island, including the history tied to Diomedes&#x27; excursions and the regions and peoples among which he had the most influence. He writes that Diomedes himself had sovereignty over the areas around the Adriatic, citing the islands of Diomedes as proof of this, as well as the various tribes of people who worshiped him even in contemporary times, including the Heneti and the Dauni. The Heneti sacrificed a white horse to Diomedes in special groves where wild animals grew tame.

This cult was not widespread; cults like those of Herakles and Theseus had a much more prominent function in the Greek world due to the benefits which they granted their followers and the popular mythological traditions of these figures.

==Death==

Strabo lists four different traditions about the hero&#x27;s life in Italy. For one, he claims that at the city of Urium, Diomedes was making a canal to the sea when he was summoned home to Argos. He left the city and his undertakings half-finished and went home where he died. The second tradition claims the opposite, that he stayed at Urium until the end of his life. The third tradition claims he disappeared on Diomedea, the uninhabited island (called after him) in the Adriatic where the Shearwaters who were formerly his companions live, which implies some kind of deification. The fourth tradition comes from the Heneti, who claim Diomedes stayed in their country and eventually had a mysterious apotheosis.

One Legend says that on his death, the albatrosses got together and sang a song (their normal call). Others say his companions were turned into birds afterwards. The family name for albatrosses, Diomedeidae, and the genus name for the great albatrosses, Diomedea, originate from Diomedes.

On San Nicola Island of the Tremiti Archipelago there is a Hellenic period tomb called Diomedes&#x27;s Tomb. According to a legend, the goddess Venus seeing the men of Diomedes cry so bitterly transformed them into birds (Diomedee) so that they could stand guard at the grave of their king. In Fellini&#x27;s movie &quot;8½&quot;, a cardinal tells this story to actor Marcello Mastroianni.

===Immortality===

According to the post Homeric stories, Diomedes was given immortality by Athena, which she had not given to his father. Pindar mentions the hero&#x27;s deification in Nemean X, where he says &quot;the golden-haired, gray-eyed goddess made Diomedes an immortal god.&quot;

In order to attain immortality, a scholiast for Nemean X says Diomedes married Hermione, the only daughter of Menelaus and Helen, and lives with the Dioscuri as an immortal god while also enjoying honours in Metapontum and Thurii.

He was worshipped as a divine being under various names in Italy where statues of him existed at Argyripa, Metapontum, Thurii, and other places. There was a temple consecrated to Diomedes called &#x27;The Timavo&#x27; at the Adriatic. There are traces in Greece also of the worship of Diomedes.

The first two traditions listed by Strabo give no indication of divinity except later through a hero cult, and the other two declare strongly for Diomedes&#x27; immortality as more than a mere cult hero.

===Afterlife===
There are less known versions of Diomedes&#x27; afterlife. A drinking song to Harmodius, one of the famous tyrannicides of Athens, includes a reference to Diomedes as an inhabitant of the Islands of the Blessed, along with Achilles and Harmodius.

In his &quot;Inferno&quot;, Dante sees Diomedes in the Eighth Circle of Hell, where the &quot;counsellors of fraud&quot; are imprisoned for eternity in sheets of flame. His offenses include advising the theft of the Palladium and, of course, the stratagem of the Trojan Horse. The same damnation is imposed on Odysseus, who is also punished for having persuaded Achilles to fight in the Trojan war, without telling him that this would inevitably lead to his death.

==Troilus and Cressida legend==
Diomedes plays an important role in the medieval legend of Troilus and Cressida, in which he becomes the girl&#x27;s new lover when she is sent to the Greek camp to join her traitorous father. In Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;, Diomedes is often seen fighting Troilus over her.

<text>Tydeus (; Ancient Greek: Τυδεύς &quot;Tūdeus&quot;) was an Aetolian hero in Greek mythology, belonging to the generation before the Trojan War. He was one of the Seven against Thebes, and the father of Diomedes, who is frequently known by the patronymic &quot;Tydides&quot;.

==Life==
Tydeus was a son of Oeneus and either Periboea, Oeneus&#x27;s second wife, or Gorge, Oeneus&#x27;s daughter. He was the husband of Deipyle, the mother of Diomedes.

Tydeus was banished from Calydon by his uncle Agrius because he had killed either his brother or a different uncle or six of his cousins. He travelled to Argos, where he married Deipyle, daughter of king Adrastus.

===Seven against Thebes===

====Gathering of the Seven====
While housing Tydeus, King Adrastus of Argos also lodged Polynices, the exiled son of Oedipus who had shared the rule of Thebes with his brother Eteocles before he was expelled by the latter. Late one night, the two young exiles got into a fierce dispute over the guest room in Adrastus&#x27;s palace. Awakened by the clamor, Adrastus rushed to the hall to find the two men locked in a brawl. It was then that Adrastus recalled a prophecy that had instructed him to &quot;yoke his daughters to a boar and a lion&quot;. Adrastus recognized Tydeus as the boar and Polynices as the lion (either by the ferocious manner in which they fought, the animals emblazoned on their shields, or the animal skins they wore) and wed his daughters to them, keeping them as his sons-in-law in Argos.

Through marriage into Adrastus&#x27;s family, Polynices and Tydeus became princes of Argos, had children, and generally lived well. Adrastus promised that he would help restore their kingdoms to them (or in other versions of the myth, Polynices asks Adrastus to help him take back Thebes) and he organized the expedition of the Seven against Thebes, and their army raised from Argolis (the area around Argos), the largest army that had ever appeared in Greece to that time.

====Nemean Games====
Shortly after the expedition arrived in Nemea, the young son of King Lycourgos was killed by a snake. In turn, Adrastus&#x27;s men killed the serpent, buried the boy and held the first Nemean Games in his honor (other stories cite Heracles&#x27; triumph over the Nemean Lion as the cause of the first games). Tydeus won the boxing event at these games.

====Envoy to Thebes====

When the expedition reached Cithaeron, Tydeus was sent ahead to demand that the Thebans reinstate Polynices. Frustrated with being ignored by Eteocles, Tydeus issued one-on-one challenges to multiple men and vanquished each one with power granted to him by Athena.

While Tydeus returned to his allies, the Thebans amassed a force of fifty men, led by Maeon and Polyphontes, and ambushed him. Tydeus killed every man with the exception of Maeon, whom he allowed to live due to signs from the gods.

====Cannibalism====
During the war, Tydeus was mortally wounded by Melanippus, the son of Astacus. The goddess Athena intended to make Tydeus immortal, but the seer Amphiaraus, knowing this and hating Tydeus, cut off Melanippus&#x27; head and gave it to Tydeus, who proceeded to eat the brains of his killer. As was Amphiaraus&#x27;s intention, Athena was so appalled that she changed her mind and let Tydeus die.

==In literature and art==

The 7th century poet Mimnermus attributes the murder of Ismene, the sister of Antigone, to Tydeus. No other Classical writer mentions the story, but the scene is represented on a 6th-century Corinthian black-figure amphora now housed in the Louvre.

Tydeus also appears in Aeschylus&#x27;s play &quot;Seven Against Thebes&quot;, as one of the &quot;Seven&quot;, and in the same role in Euripides&#x27; play &quot;The Phoenician Women&quot;. He kills the defender Melanippus, but is mortally wounded himself. In other versions of the myth, the detail is added that the goddess Athena planned to make him immortal but refuses after Tydeus in a hubristic fit devours the brain of the dead Melanippus.

Tydeus is mentioned multiple times in the &quot;Iliad&quot;. One of the most notable mentions is in Book IV where Agamemnon reminds Diomedes of the deeds of his father Tydeus. Agamemnon recites the events told in the section above.

<doc id="81931" wikidata="Q11210" url="?curid=81931" title="Coordinate system">
<text>In geometry, a coordinate system is a system that uses one or more numbers, or coordinates, to uniquely determine the position of the points or other geometric elements on a manifold such as Euclidean space. The order of the coordinates is significant, and they are sometimes identified by their position in an ordered tuple and sometimes by a letter, as in &quot;the &quot;x&quot;-coordinate&quot;. The coordinates are taken to be real numbers in elementary mathematics, but may be complex numbers or elements of a more abstract system such as a commutative ring. The use of a coordinate system allows problems in geometry to be translated into problems about numbers and &quot;vice versa&quot;; this is the basis of analytic geometry.

==Common coordinate systems==

===Number line===
The simplest example of a coordinate system is the identification of points on a line with real numbers using the &quot;number line&quot;. In this system, an arbitrary point &quot;O&quot; (the &quot;origin&quot;) is chosen on a given line. The coordinate of a point &quot;P&quot; is defined as the signed distance from &quot;O&quot; to &quot;P&quot;, where the signed distance is the distance taken as positive or negative depending on which side of the line &quot;P&quot; lies. Each point is given a unique coordinate and each real number is the coordinate of a unique point.
===Cartesian coordinate system===
The prototypical example of a coordinate system is the Cartesian coordinate system. In the plane, two perpendicular lines are chosen and the coordinates of a point are taken to be the signed distances to the lines. In three dimensions, three mutually orthogonal planes are chosen and the three coordinates of a point are the signed distances to each of the planes. This can be generalized to create &quot;n&quot; coordinates for any point in &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space.

Depending on the direction and order of the coordinate axes, the three-dimensional system may be a right-handed or a left-handed system.

===Polar coordinate system===

Another common coordinate system for the plane is the &quot;polar coordinate system&quot;. A point is chosen as the &quot;pole&quot; and a ray from this point is taken as the &quot;polar axis&quot;. For a given angle &quot;θ&quot;, there is a single line through the pole whose angle with the polar axis is &quot;θ&quot; (measured counterclockwise from the axis to the line). Then there is a unique point on this line whose signed distance from the origin is &quot;r&quot; for given number &quot;r&quot;. For a given pair of coordinates (&quot;r&quot;, &quot;θ&quot;) there is a single point, but any point is represented by many pairs of coordinates. For example, (&quot;r&quot;, &quot;θ&quot;), (&quot;r&quot;, &quot;θ&quot;+2&quot;π&quot;) and (−&quot;r&quot;, &quot;θ&quot;+&quot;π&quot;) are all polar coordinates for the same point. The pole is represented by (0, &quot;θ&quot;) for any value of &quot;θ&quot;.
===Cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems===
There are two common methods for extending the polar coordinate system to three dimensions. In the cylindrical coordinate system, a &quot;z&quot;-coordinate with the same meaning as in Cartesian coordinates is added to the &quot;r&quot; and &quot;θ&quot; polar coordinates giving a triple (&quot;r&quot;, &quot;θ&quot;, &quot;z&quot;). Spherical coordinates take this a step further by converting the pair of cylindrical coordinates (&quot;r&quot;, &quot;z&quot;) to polar coordinates (&quot;ρ&quot;, &quot;φ&quot;) giving a triple (&quot;ρ&quot;, &quot;θ&quot;, &quot;φ&quot;).

===Homogeneous coordinate system===

A point in the plane may be represented in &quot;homogeneous coordinates&quot; by a triple (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;) where &quot;x&quot;/&quot;z&quot; and &quot;y&quot;/&quot;z&quot; are the Cartesian coordinates of the point. This introduces an &quot;extra&quot; coordinate since only two are needed to specify a point on the plane, but this system is useful in that it represents any point on the projective plane without the use of infinity. In general, a homogeneous coordinate system is one where only the ratios of the coordinates are significant and not the actual values.

===Other commonly used systems===
Some other common coordinate systems are the following:
* Curvilinear coordinates are a generalization of coordinate systems generally; the system is based on the intersection of curves.
** Orthogonal coordinates: coordinate surfaces meet at right angles
** Skew coordinates: coordinate surfaces are not orthogonal
* The log-polar coordinate system represents a point in the plane by the logarithm of the distance from the origin and an angle measured from a reference line intersecting the origin.
* Plücker coordinates are a way of representing lines in 3D Euclidean space using a six-tuple of numbers as homogeneous coordinates.
* Generalized coordinates are used in the Lagrangian treatment of mechanics.
* Canonical coordinates are used in the Hamiltonian treatment of mechanics.
* Barycentric coordinate system as used for ternary plots and more generally in the analysis of triangles.
* Trilinear coordinates are used in the context of triangles.

There are ways of describing curves without coordinates, using intrinsic equations that use invariant quantities such as curvature and arc length. These include:
* The Whewell equation relates arc length and the tangential angle.
* The Cesàro equation relates arc length and curvature.

==Coordinates of geometric objects==
Coordinates systems are often used to specify the position of a point, but they may also be used to specify the position of more complex figures such as lines, planes, circles or spheres. For example, Plücker coordinates are used to determine the position of a line in space. When there is a need, the type of figure being described is used to distinguish the type of coordinate system, for example the term &quot;line coordinates&quot; is used for any coordinate system that specifies the position of a line.

It may occur that systems of coordinates for two different sets of geometric figures are equivalent in terms of their analysis. An example of this is the systems of homogeneous coordinates for points and lines in the projective plane. The two systems in a case like this are said to be &quot;dualistic&quot;. Dualistic systems have the property that results from one system can be carried over to the other since these results are only different interpretations of the same analytical result; this is known as the &quot;principle of duality&quot;.

==Transformations==


There are often many different possible coordinate systems for describing geometrical figures. The relationship between different systems is described by &quot;coordinate transformations&quot;, which give formulas for the coordinates in one system in terms of the coordinates in another system. For example, in the plane, if Cartesian coordinates (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) and polar coordinates (&quot;r&quot;, &quot;θ&quot;) have the same origin, and the polar axis is the positive &quot;x&quot; axis, then the coordinate transformation from polar to Cartesian coordinates is given by &quot;x&quot; = &quot;r&quot; cos&quot;θ&quot; and &quot;y&quot; = &quot;r&quot; sin&quot;θ&quot;.

With every bijection from the space to itself two coordinate transformations can be associated:
* Such that the new coordinates of the image of each point are the same as the old coordinates of the original point (the formulas for the mapping are the inverse of those for the coordinate transformation)
* Such that the old coordinates of the image of each point are the same as the new coordinates of the original point (the formulas for the mapping are the same as those for the coordinate transformation)

For example, in 1D, if the mapping is a translation of 3 to the right, the first moves the origin from 0 to 3, so that the coordinate of each point becomes 3 less, while the second moves the origin from 0 to −3, so that the coordinate of each point becomes 3 more.

==Coordinate lines/curves==

Given a coordinate system, if one of the coordinates of a point varies while the other coordinates are held constant, then the resulting curve is called a coordinate curve. If a coordinate curve is a straight line, it is called a coordinate line. A coordinate system for which some coordinate curves are not lines is called a &quot;curvilinear coordinate system&quot;.
&quot;Orthogonal coordinates&quot; are a special but extremely common case of curvilinear coordinates.

A coordinate line with all other constant coordinates equal to zero is called a coordinate axis, an oriented line used for assigning coordinates. 
In a Cartesian coordinate system, all coordinates curves are lines, and, therefore, there are as many coordinate axes as coordinates. Moreover, the coordinate axes are pairwise orthogonal. 

A polar coordinate system is a curvilinear system where coordinate curves are lines or circles. However, one of the coordinate curves is reduced to a single point, the origin, which is often viewed as a circle of radius zero. Similarly, spherical and cylindrical coordinate systems have coordinate curves that are lines, circles or circles of radius zero.

Many curves can occur as coordinate curves. For example, the coordinate curves of parabolic coordinates are parabolas.

==Coordinate planes/surfaces==


In three-dimensional space, if one coordinate is held constant and the other two are allowed to vary, then the resulting surface is called a coordinate surface. For example, the coordinate surfaces obtained by holding &quot;ρ&quot; constant in the spherical coordinate system are the spheres with center at the origin. In three-dimensional space the intersection of two coordinate surfaces is a coordinate curve. In the Cartesian coordinate system we may speak of coordinate planes.
Similarly, coordinate hypersurfaces are the -dimensional spaces resulting from fixing a single coordinate of an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional coordinate system.

==Coordinate maps==
The concept of a &quot;coordinate map&quot;, or &quot;coordinate chart&quot; is central to the theory of manifolds. A coordinate map is essentially a coordinate system for a subset of a given space with the property that each point has exactly one set of coordinates. More precisely, a coordinate map is a homeomorphism from an open subset of a space &quot;X&quot; to an open subset of R&quot;n&quot;. It is often not possible to provide one consistent coordinate system for an entire space. In this case, a collection of coordinate maps are put together to form an atlas covering the space. A space equipped with such an atlas is called a &quot;manifold&quot; and additional structure can be defined on a manifold if the structure is consistent where the coordinate maps overlap. For example, a differentiable manifold is a manifold where the change of coordinates from one coordinate map to another is always a differentiable function.

==Orientation-based coordinates==
In geometry and kinematics, coordinate systems are used to describe the (linear) position of points and the angular position of axes, planes, and rigid bodies. In the latter case, the orientation of a second (typically referred to as &quot;local&quot;) coordinate system, fixed to the node, is defined based on the first (typically referred to as &quot;global&quot; or &quot;world&quot; coordinate system). For instance, the orientation of a rigid body can be represented by an orientation matrix, which includes, in its three columns, the Cartesian coordinates of three points. These points are used to define the orientation of the axes of the local system; they are the tips of three unit vectors aligned with those axes.

==Geographic systems==
The Earth as a whole is one of the most common geometric spaces requiring the precise measurement of location, and thus coordinate systems. Starting with the Greeks of the Hellenistic period, a variety of coordinate systems have been developed based on the types above, including:
* Geographic coordinate system, the spherical coordinates of latitude and longitude
* Projected coordinate systems, including thousands of cartesian coordinate systems, each based on a map projection to create a planar surface of the world or a region.
* Geocentric coordinate system, a three-dimensional cartesian coordinate system that models the earth as an object, and are most commonly used for modeling the orbits of satellites, including the Global Positioning System and other satellite navigation systems.

<doc id="81935" wikidata="Q212818" url="?curid=81935" title="Phaedra (mythology)">
<text>In Greek mythology, Phaedra (; ) is a Cretan princess. Her name derives from the Greek word (), which means &quot;bright&quot;. According to legend, she was the daughter of Minos and Pasiphaë, and the wife of Theseus. Phaedra fell in love with her stepson Hippolytus. After he rejected her advances, she accused him of trying to rape her, causing Theseus to pray to Poseidon to kill Hippolytus (which Poseidon did), and then she killed herself.

The story of Phaedra is told in Euripides&#x27; play &quot;Hippolytus&quot;, Seneca the Younger&#x27;s &quot;Phaedra&quot;, and Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Heroides&quot;. It has inspired many modern works of art and literature, including a play by Jean Racine.

== Family ==
Phaedra was the daughter of Minos and Pasiphaë of Crete, and thus sister to Acacallis, Ariadne, Androgeus, Deucalion, Xenodice, Glaucus and Catreus and half-sister to the Minotaur. She was the wife of Theseus and the mother of Demophon of Athens and Acamas.

== Mythology ==
Much of what we know about the mythology and story of Phaedra is from a collection of plays and poems. Many of these earlier sources such as &quot;Phaedra&quot;, a play by Sophocles, and &quot;Hippolytus Veiled&quot;, a play by Euripides, have been lost. However, works such as &quot;Phaedra&quot;, written by Roman statesman and philosopher Seneca the Younger, and the &quot;Heroides&quot;, a collection of poems written by Ovid, give details of the story. As a result there are many different versions of the story of Phaedra and Hippolytus, but they all share the same general structure, with two versions becoming more prominent over time. Version 1 depicts Phaedra as the shameless and lustful wife of Theseus, the King of Athens. The other version, Version 2, shows Phaedra in a much kinder light, as a noble and virtuous queen, yet each has a similarly tragic ending.

=== Traditional version ===

In the more traditional version of the story, Phaedra is the primary cause of misfortune in the tale. The story goes that Phaedra, who was the mother of two sons, Acamas and Demophon, falls in love with her stepson Hippolytus, Theseus&#x27;s son by another woman (born to either Hippolyta, queen of the Amazons, or Antiope, her sister) and sets out to entice him. It is unclear in this version exactly why Hippolytus rejects Phaedra, if not simply because he is her stepson, but Phaedra becomes humiliated when Hippolytus refuses her.

Afraid of the consequences that may befall her if Theseus learns about her actions, she lies to her husband that Hippolytus tried to rape her. This angers Theseus who immediately curses his son with one of three wishes granted to him by Poseidon, the god of the sea. At the request of Theseus to kill Hippolytus, the god summons a huge bull that rises from the sea and scares Hippolytus&#x27;s horses into a frenzy that drags the rider to his death. In one rendition of the story Hippolytus&#x27;s name is translated to &quot;the one who is torn apart by horses&quot;.

In the end Phaedra&#x27;s treachery is somehow discovered (it is unclear how), and to avoid a more painful death, she decides to take her own life.

=== Alternative version ===
In this version of the story, Phaedra has a reputation as a virtuous queen and is not entirely responsible for her actions. She gets caught in the crossfire between Hippolytus and Aphrodite, the goddess of love. This narrative requires a little background on an earlier conflict between Hippolytus and Aphrodite. Hippolytus is a devout follower of Artemis, the goddess of the hunt and, among other things, the goddess of chastity. As a result he hails her as the greatest of all deities and in a show of devotion to honor the goddess, Hippolytus vows eternal chastity, swearing that he will never love or marry. This offends Aphrodite who is regularly worshipped by all in Greek mythology, and in an attempt to punish Hippolytus, the goddess of love curses his stepmother Phaedra to fall madly in love with him.

Phaedra becomes distraught and depressed for several months due to &quot;dreadful longings&quot; for Hippolytus. Eventually, unable to tolerate the burden of her suffering in silence, she confides in her nurse and shares her feelings towards Hippolytus. The nurse concerned about her mistress&#x27;s health tells Hippolytus about how Phaedra feels. Bound by his oath of abstinence, Hippolytus rejects his stepmother. When Phaedra learns of her nurse&#x27;s actions, she fears the consequences of her immoral desires and plans to commit suicide. But before doing so, she writes a letter to her husband Theseus accusing Hippolytus of attempting to seduce her in an attempt to clear her name and possibly protect her children from misfortune.

Similar to the ending of Version 1, once Theseus reads Phaedra&#x27;s letter and learns of his son&#x27;s supposed sins, he prays to Poseidon to kill his son. And in a very similar fashion to the first tale, Poseidon summons a huge bull to scare Hippolytus&#x27;s horses into a wild frenzy that kills him. However in this version of the narrative, the story does not end there. Artemis is saddened by the loss of her devout follower and reveals the truth to Theseus about Aphrodite and the curse she placed on his wife. The story ends with Theseus grieving over the death of his wife and son.

=== Other versions of the story ===
In another version, after Phaedra told Theseus that Hippolytus had raped her, Theseus killed his son, and Phaedra then committed suicide out of guilt, for she had not intended Hippolytus to die. Artemis later told Theseus the truth.

In a fourth version, Phaedra told Theseus and did not kill herself; Dionysus then sent a wild bull which terrified Hippolytus&#x27;s horses.

Euripides twice placed this story on the Athenian stage, of which one version survives.

According to some sources, Hippolytus had spurned Aphrodite to remain a steadfast and virginal devotee of Artemis, and Aphrodite made Phaedra fall in love with him as a punishment. The Athenians maintained a small shrine high on the south slope of the Acropolis devoted to Aphrodite &#x27;for Hippolytus&#x27;.

In one version, Phaedra&#x27;s nurse told Hippolytus of her love, and he swore he would not reveal her as a source of information.

<text>Sir George Cayley, [[Cayley baronets|6th Baronet]] (27 December 1773 – 15 December 1857) was an English engineer, inventor, and aviator. He is one of the most important people in the history of aeronautics. Many consider him to be the first true scientific aerial investigator and the first person to understand the underlying principles and forces of flight and the first man to create the wire wheel.

In 1799, he set forth the concept of the modern aeroplane as a fixed-wing flying machine with separate systems for lift, propulsion, and control.
He was a pioneer of aeronautical engineering and is sometimes referred to as &quot;the father of aviation.&quot; He identified the four forces which act on a heavier-than-air flying vehicle: weight, lift, drag and thrust. Modern aeroplane design is based on those discoveries and on the importance of cambered wings, also proposed by Cayley. He constructed the first flying model aeroplane and also diagrammed the elements of vertical flight.
He also designed the first glider reliably reported to carry a human aloft. He correctly predicted that sustained flight would not occur until a lightweight engine was developed to provide adequate thrust and lift. The Wright brothers acknowledged his importance to the development of aviation.

Cayley represented the Whig party as Member of Parliament for Scarborough from 1832 to 1835, and in 1838, helped found the UK&#x27;s first Polytechnic Institute, the Royal Polytechnic Institution (now University of Westminster) and served as its chairman for many years. He was elected as a Vice-President of the Yorkshire Philosophical Society in 1824. He was a founding member of the British Association for the Advancement of Science and was a distant cousin of the mathematician Arthur Cayley.

==General engineering projects==
Cayley, from Brompton-by-Sawdon, near Scarborough in Yorkshire, inherited Brompton Hall and Wydale Hall and other estates on the death of his father, the 5th baronet. Captured by the optimism of the times, he engaged in a wide variety of engineering projects. Among the many things that he developed are self-righting lifeboats, tension-spoke wheels,
 the &quot;Universal Railway&quot; (his term for caterpillar tractors), automatic signals for railway crossings, seat belts, small scale helicopters, and a kind of prototypical internal combustion engine fuelled by gunpowder (Gunpowder engine). He suggested that a more practical engine might be made using gaseous vapours rather than gunpowder, thus foreseeing the modern internal combustion engine. He also contributed in the fields of prosthetics, air engines, electricity, theatre architecture, ballistics, optics and land reclamation, and held the belief that these advancements should be freely available.

According to the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, George Cayley was the inventor of the hot air engine in 1807: &quot;The first successfully working hot air engine was Cayley&#x27;s, in which much ingenuity was displayed in overcoming practical difficulties arising from the high working temperature.&quot; His second hot air engine of 1837 was a forerunner of the internal combustion engine: &quot;In 1837, Sir George Cayley, Bart., Assoc. Inst. C.E., applied the products of combustion from closed furnaces, so that they should act directly upon a piston in a cylinder. Plate No. 9 represents a pair of engines upon this principle, together equal to 8 HP, when the piston travels at the rate of 220 feet per minute.&quot;

==Flying machines==

Cayley is mainly remembered for his pioneering studies and experiments with flying machines, including the working, piloted glider that he designed and built. He wrote a landmark three-part treatise titled &quot;On Aerial Navigation&quot; (1809–1810), which was published in Nicholson&#x27;s &quot;Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry and the Arts&quot;. The 2007 discovery of sketches in Cayley&#x27;s school notebooks (held in the archive of the Royal Aeronautical Society Library) revealed that even at school Cayley was developing his ideas on the theories of flight. It has been claimed that these images indicate that Cayley identified the principle of a lift-generating inclined plane as early as 1792. To measure the drag on objects at different speeds and angles of attack, he later built a &quot;whirling-arm apparatus&quot;, a development of earlier work in ballistics and air resistance. He also experimented with rotating wing sections of various forms in the stairwells at Brompton Hall.
These scientific experiments led him to develop an efficient cambered airfoil and to identify the four vector forces that influence an aircraft: &quot;thrust&quot;, &quot;lift&quot;, &quot;drag&quot;, and &quot;weight&quot;. He discovered the importance of the dihedral angle for lateral stability in flight, and deliberately set the centre of gravity of many of his models well below the wings for this reason; these principles influenced the development of hang gliders. As a result of his investigations into many other theoretical aspects of flight, many now acknowledge him as the first aeronautical engineer. His emphasis on lightness led him to invent a new method of constructing lightweight wheels which is in common use today. For his landing wheels, he shifted the spoke&#x27;s forces from compression to tension by making them from tightly-stretched string, in effect &quot;reinventing the wheel&quot;. Wire soon replaced the string in practical applications and over time the wire wheel came into common use on bicycles, cars, aeroplanes and many other vehicles.
The model glider successfully flown by Cayley in 1804 had the layout of a modern aircraft, with a kite-shaped wing towards the front and an adjustable tailplane at the back consisting of horizontal stabilisers and a vertical fin. A movable weight allowed adjustment of the model&#x27;s centre of gravity. In 1843 he was the first to suggest the idea of a convertiplane. At some time before 1849 he designed and built a biplane in which an unknown ten-year-old boy flew. Later, with the continued assistance of his grandson George John Cayley and his resident engineer Thomas Vick, he developed a larger scale glider (also probably fitted with &quot;flappers&quot;) which flew across Brompton Dale in front of Wydale Hall in 1853. The first adult aviator has been claimed to be either Cayley&#x27;s coachman, footman or butler. One source (Gibbs-Smith) has suggested that it was John Appleby, a Cayley employee; however, there is no definitive evidence to fully identify the pilot. An entry in volume IX of the 8th Encyclopædia Britannica of 1855 is the most contemporaneous authoritative account regarding the event. A 2007 biography of Cayley (Richard Dee&#x27;s &quot;The Man Who Discovered Flight: George Cayley and the First Airplane&quot;) claims the first pilot was Cayley&#x27;s grandson George John Cayley (1826–1878).

A replica of the 1853 machine was flown at the original site in Brompton Dale by Derek Piggott in 1973 for TV and in the mid-1980s for the IMAX film &quot;On the Wing&quot;. The glider is currently on display at the Yorkshire Air Museum. 

A second replica of the Cayley Glider was built in 2003 by a team from BAE Systems to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the original flight. Built using modern materials and techniques, the craft was test flown by Alan McWhirter at RAF Pocklington, before being flown by Sir Richard Branson on 5 July 2003 at Brompton Dale, the site of the original gliders flight. Virgin Atlantic sponsored construction of the replica glider. In 2005, the replica glider was transported and rebuilt in Salina, Kansas, as part of the ground show for the return of the &#x27;round-the-world&#x27; Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer flight, with the glider being towed by a vehicle along the runway in front of the gathered crowds. Returning to the UK, the replica glider was flown once more for a segment on &quot;The One Show&quot;. Again towed by a vehicle, the glider undertook its longest and highest flights during the filming and was flown by Dave Holborn. Placed into storage at BAE System&#x27;s Farnborough site, it was donated to the South Yorkshire Aircraft Museum in 2021 and is now on display.

==Memorial==

Cayley died in 1857 and was buried in the graveyard of All Saints&#x27; Church in Brompton-by-Sawdon.

He is commemorated in Scarborough at the University of Hull, Scarborough Campus, where a hall of residence and a teaching building are named after him. He is one of many scientists and engineers commemorated by having a hall of residence and a bar at Loughborough University named after him. The University of Westminster also honours Cayley&#x27;s contribution to the formation of the institution with a gold plaque at the entrance of the Regent Street building.
There are display boards and a video film at the Royal Air Force Museum London in Hendon honouring Cayley&#x27;s achievements and a modern exhibition and film &quot;Pioneers of Aviation&quot; at the Yorkshire Air Museum, Elvington, York. 
The Sir George Cayley Sailwing Club is a North Yorkshire-based free flight club, affiliated to the British Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association, which has borne his name since its founding in 1975.

In 1974, Cayley was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame.

==Family==
On 3 July 1795 Cayley married Sarah Walker, daughter of his first tutor George Walker. (J W Clay&#x27;s expanded edition of Dugdale&#x27;s Visitation of Yorkshire incorrectly gives the date as 9 July 1795, as does George Cayley&#x27;s entry in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;.) They had ten children, of whom three died young. Sarah died on 8 December 1854.

<text>Acamas or Akamas (; Ancient Greek: Ἀκάμας, folk etymology: &#x27;unwearying&#x27;) was a name attributed to several characters in Greek mythology. The following three all fought in the Trojan War, and only the first was not mentioned by Homer. 
*Acamas, son of Theseus, mentioned by Virgil as being in the Trojan horse.
*Acamas, son of Antenor, fought on the side of the Trojans and killed one Greek.
*Acamas, son of Eussorus, from Thrace, and thus, could be the brother of Aenete and Cyzicus. With his comrade Peiros, son of Imbrasus, Acamas led a contingent of Thracian warriors to the Trojan War. Acamas was killed by Ajax or by Idomeneus who thrust him out of his chariot and caught him, as he fell, on the tip of his spear.

Others:
*Acamas or Acamans, a Cyclops that lived in the company of Pyracmon or Pyragmon in Pelorum (north-east coast of Sicily).
*Acamas, one of the Thebans who laid an ambush for Tydeus when he returned from Thebes. He was killed by Tydeus.
*Acamas, an Aetolian in the army of the Seven against Thebes.
*Acamas, a soldier in the army of the Seven against Thebes. When the two armies attack each other at the gates of the city, the hard-hearted Acamas pierces the Theban horseman Iphis.
*Acamas, one of the Suitors of Penelope who came from Dulichium along with other 56 wooers. He, with the other suitors, was slain by Odysseus with the aid of Eumaeus, Philoetius, and Telemachus.
*Acamas, one of Actaeon&#x27;s dogs.

<text>In Greek mythology, Eëtion or Eetion (; &quot;Ēetíōn&quot; ) was the king of the Cilician Thebe.

== Family ==
Eetion was the father of Andromache, wife of Hector, and of seven sons, including Podes.

== Mythology ==
In Book 6 of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Andromache relates that Achilles killed Eëtion and his seven sons in a raid on Thebe, but in Book 17, Podes appears and is killed by Menelaus. This inconsistency on Homer&#x27;s part may be an implication that some traditions gave Eëtion eight sons.

His wife is never named, but Andromache relates that she was captured in the same raid in which Eëtion was killed, and died of sickness in Troy following her release. However, a certain Astynome, also called Chryseis, was said to be the wife of Eetion at that time. She was carried off by Achilles and later became the war prize of Agamemnon.

<text>Scamander (), also Skamandros () or Xanthos (), was a river god in Greek mythology.

== Etymology ==
The meaning of this name is uncertain. The second element looks as though it is derived from Greek (), meaning &quot;of a man&quot;, but there are sources who doubt this. The first element is more difficult to pinpoint; it could be derived from (), &quot;to limp, to stumble (over an obstacle)&quot;, or from (), meaning &quot;left(-handed), awkward&quot;. The meaning of the name might then perhaps be &quot;limping man&quot; or &quot;awkward man&quot;. This would refer to the many bends and winds (meanders) of the river, which does not run straight, but &quot;limps&quot; its way along.

==Geography==
The Scamander River was named after the river god Scamander. The Scamander River was the river that surrounded Troy. The god Scamander took the side of the Trojans in the Trojan War.

== Family ==
According to Hesiod, Scamander is the son of the Titans Oceanus and Tethys. He is alternately described as a son of Zeus.

Scamander was the father of King Teucer whose mother was the water nymph Idaea. He was also mentioned as the father of Glaucia, lover of Deimachus. Additionally, Xanthus was credited to be the father of Eurythemista who bore Pelops and Niobe to Tantalus. Strymo or Rhoeo, wife of Laomedon, king of Troy was also called his daughter. Lastly, he also became the father of the priest Melus by an unknown woman or nymph.

== Mythology ==

Scamander fought on the side of the Trojans during the Trojan War (&quot;Iliad&quot; XX, 73/74; XXI), after the Greek hero Achilles insulted him. Scamander was also said to have attempted to kill Achilles three times, and the hero was only saved due to the intervention of Hera, Athena and Hephaestus. In this context, he is the personification of the Scamander River that flowed from Mount Ida across the plain beneath the city of Troy, joining the Hellespont north of the city. The Achaeans, according to Homer, had set up their camp near its mouth, and their battles with the Trojans were fought on the plain of Scamander. In &quot;Iliad&quot; XXII (149ff), Homer states that the river had two springs: one produced warm water; the other yielded cold water, regardless of the season.

According to Homer, he was called Xanthos by gods and Scamander by men, which might indicate that the former name refers to the god and the latter one to the river itself.

In a story by Pseudo-Plutarch, Scamander went mad during the mysteries of Rhea and flung himself into the river Xanthus, which was then renamed to Scamander.

<text>In Greek mythology, Protesilaus (; ) was a hero in the &quot;Iliad&quot; who was venerated at cult sites in Thessaly and Thrace. Protesilaus was the son of Iphiclus, a &quot;lord of many sheep&quot;; as grandson of the eponymous Phylacos, he was the leader of the Phylaceans. Hyginus surmised that he was originally known as Iolaus—not to be confused with Iolaus, the nephew of Heracles—but was referred to as &quot;Protesilaus&quot; after being the first (, &quot;protos&quot;) to leap ashore at Troy, and thus the first to die in the war.

== Description ==
In the account of Dares the Phrygian, Protesilaus was illustrated as &quot;. . .fair-skinned, and dignified. He was swift, self-confident, and even rash.&quot;

==Mythology==
Protesilaus was one of the suitors of Helen. He brought forty black ships with him to Troy, drawing his men from &quot;flowering&quot; Pyrasus, coastal Antron and Pteleus, &quot;deep in grass&quot;, in addition to his native Phylace. Protesilaus was the first to land: &quot;the first man who dared to leap ashore when the Greek fleet touched the Troad&quot;, Pausanias recalled, quoting the author of the epic tale called the &quot;Cypria&quot;. An oracle by Thetis had prophesied that the first Greek to walk on the land after stepping off a ship in the Trojan War would be the first to die, and so, after killing four men, he was himself slain by Hector. Alternate sources have him slain by either Aeneas, Euphorbus, Achates, or Cycnus. Another legend claims that Odysseus threw his shield on the beach and jumped upon it. Tricked Protesilaus thinking that Odysseus was the first who stepped on Trojan soil, jumped second and died afterwards . After Protesilaus&#x27; death, his brother, Podarces, joined the war in his place. The gods had pity on his widow, Laodamia, daughter of Acastus, and brought him up from Hades to see her. She was at first overjoyed, thinking he had returned from Troy, but after the gods returned him to the underworld, she found the loss unbearable. She had a bronze statue of her late husband constructed, and devoted herself to it. After her worried father had witnessed her behavior, he had it destroyed; however, Laodamia jumped into the fire with it. Another source claims his wife was Polydora, daughter of Meleager.

According to legend, the Nymphs planted elms on the tomb, in the Thracian Chersonese, of &quot;great-hearted Protesilaus&quot; («μεγάθυμου Πρωτεσιλάου»), elms that grew to be the tallest in the known world; but when their topmost branches saw far off the ruins of Troy, they immediately withered, so great still was the bitterness of the hero buried below. The story is the subject of a poem by Antiphilus of Byzantium (1st century A.D.) in the Palatine Anthology:
&quot;&#x27;


==Cult of Protesilaus==
Only two sanctuaries to Protesilaus are attested. There was a shrine of Protesilaus at Phylace, his home in Thessaly, where his widow was left lacerating her cheeks in mourning him, and games were organised there in his honour, Pindar noted. The tomb of Protesilaus at Elaeus in the Thracian Chersonese is documented in the 5th century BCE, when, during the Persian War, votive treasure deposited at his tomb was plundered by the satrap Artayctes, under permission from Xerxes. The Greeks later captured and executed Artayctes, returning the treasure. The tomb was mentioned again when Alexander the Great arrived at Elaeus on his campaign against the Persian Empire. He offered a sacrifice on the tomb, hoping to avoid the fate of Protesilaus when he arrived in Asia. Like Protesilaus before him, Alexander was the first to set foot on Asian soil during his campaign. Philostratus writing of this temple in the early 3rd century CE, speaks of a cult statue of Protesilaus at this temple &quot;standing on a base which was shaped like the prow of a boat.&quot; Coins of Elaeus from the time of Commodus with Protesilaus on the prow of a ship, in helmet, cuirass and short chiton on the reverse probably depict this statue. Strabo also mentions the sanctuary.
A founder-cult of Protesilaus at Scione, in Pallene, Chalcidice, was given an etiology by the Greek grammarian and mythographer of the Augustan-era Conon that is at variance with the epic tradition. In this, Conon asserts that Protesilaus survived the Trojan War and was returning with Priam&#x27;s sister Aethilla as his captive. When the ships go ashore for water on the coast of Pallene, between Scione and Mende, Aethilla persuaded the other Trojan women to burn the ships, forcing Protesilaus to remain and found the city of Scione. A rare tetradrachm of Scione ca. 480 BCE acquired by the British Museum depicts Protesilaus, identified by the retrograde legend .

Protesilaus, speaking from beyond the grave, is the oracular source of the corrected eye-witness version of the actions of heroes at Troy, related by a &quot;vine-dresser&quot; to a Phoenician merchant in the framing device that gives an air of authenticity to the narratives of Philostratus&#x27; &quot;Heroicus&quot;, a late literary representation of Greek hero-cult traditions that developed independently of the epic tradition.

==Cultural depictions==
Among very few representations of Protesilaus, a sculpture by Deinomenes is just a passing mention in Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot;; the outstanding surviving examples are two Roman copies of a lost mid-fifth century Greek bronze original representing Protesilaus at his defining moment, one of them in a torso at the British Museum, the other at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Metropolitan&#x27;s sculpture of a heroically nude helmeted warrior stands on a forward-slanting base, looking down and slightly to his left, with his right arm raised, prepared to strike, would not be identifiable, save by comparison made by Gisela Richter with a torso of the same model and its associated slanting base, schematically carved as the prow of a ship encircled by waves: Protesilaus about to jump ashore.

Euripides had a tragedy named Protesilaus after him, but it is not one of his extant plays.

The poem in the &quot;Palatine Anthology&quot; (VII.141) on Protesilaus by Antiphilus of Byzantium in turn inspired F. L. Lucas&#x27;s poem &quot;The Elms of Protesilaus&quot; (1927).

<text>In Greek mythology, the name Laodamia (Ancient Greek: Λαοδάμεια &quot;Laodámeia&quot;) referred to:

* Laodamia (or Hippodamia), a Lycian princess as the daughter of Bellerophon and Philonoe, daughter of King Iobates. Her mother was also known Alkimedousa, Anticleia, Pasandra or Cassandra. Laodamia&#x27;s brothers were Hippolochus and Isander, and by Zeus, she became the mother of Sarpedon. She was shot by Artemis (that is, died a sudden, instant death) one day when she was weaving. Diodorus Siculus called her Deidamia, the wife of Evander, who was a son of Sarpedon the elder and by her father of Sarpedon the younger. Xanthus was also called the father of Sarpedon according to one account.
*Laodamia, daughter of Acastus and Astydamia and the wife of Protesilaus. When her husband fell in the Trojan War, Laodamia committed suicide rather than be without him.
* Laodamia or Leaneira, an Arcadian queen as the wife of King Arcas by whom she became the mother of Elatus, Apheidas and Triphylus. Laodamia was the daughter of King Amyclas of Sparta and Diomede, daughter of Lapithes. Through this parentage, she was considered the sister of Argalus, Cynortes, Hyacinthus, Polyboea, Hegesandra and, in other versions, of Daphne.
* Laodamia, daughter of Alcmaeon, wife of Peleus and mother by him of Polydora. But see Antigone.
* Laodamia, wife of Anticlus. Her husband was one of the men who were hiding in the Trojan Horse.
* Laodamia, alternate name for Iphthime, daughter of Icarius of Sparta and Asterodia, daughter of Eurypylus. She was the sister of Penelope, Amasichus, Phalereus, Thoon, Pheremmelias, Perilaos. Laodamia was also called Laodice, Mede and Hypsipyle.
* Laodamia or Arsinoe, nurse of Orestes. She saved his life by sending him to Strophius after the murder of Agamemnon, whereas Aegisthus killed her own son, taking him for Orestes.
*Laodamia, alternate name for Hippodamia (wife of Pirithous) occurring in a red-figure vase painting.

<text>Companion planting in gardening and agriculture is the planting of different crops in proximity for any of a number of different reasons, including weed suppression, pest control, pollination, providing habitat for beneficial insects, maximizing use of space, and to otherwise increase crop productivity. Companion planting is a form of polyculture.

Companion planting is used by farmers and gardeners in both industrialized and developing countries for many reasons. Many of the modern principles of companion planting were present many centuries ago in forest gardens in Asia, and thousands of years ago in Mesoamerica. The technique may allow farmers to reduce costly inputs of artificial fertilisers and pesticides.

== Traditional practice ==

=== History ===

Companion planting was practiced in various forms by the indigenous peoples of the Americas prior to the arrival of Europeans. These peoples domesticated squash 8,000 to 10,000 years ago, then maize, then common beans, forming the Three Sisters agricultural technique. The cornstalk served as a trellis for the beans to climb, the beans fixed nitrogen, benefitting the maize, and the wide leaves of the squash plant provide ample shade for the soil keeping it moist and fertile.

Authors in classical Greece and Rome, around 2000 years ago, were aware that some plants were toxic (allelopathic) to other plants nearby. Theophrastus reported that the bay tree and the cabbage plant enfeebled grapevines. Pliny the Elder wrote that the &quot;shade&quot; of the walnut tree (&quot;Juglans regia&quot;) poisoned other plants.

In China, mosquito ferns (&quot;Azolla&quot; spp.) have been used for at least a thousand years as companion plants for rice crops. They host a cyanobacterium (&quot;Anabaena azollae&quot;) that fixes nitrogen from the atmosphere, and they block light from plants that would compete with the rice.

=== 20th century ===

More recently, starting in the 1920s, organic farming and horticulture have made frequent use of companion planting, since many other means of fertilizing, weed reduction and pest control are forbidden. Permaculture advocates similar methods. 

The list of companion plants used in such systems is large, and includes vegetables, fruit trees, kitchen herbs, garden flowers, and fodder crops. The number of pairwise interactions both positive (the pair of species assist each other) and negative (the plants are best not grown together) is larger, though the evidence for such interactions ranges from controlled experiments to hearsay. For example, plants in the cabbage family (Brassicaceae) are traditionally claimed to grow well with celery, onion family plants (&quot;Allium&quot;), and aromatic herbs, but are thought best not grown with strawberry or tomato.

In 2022, agronomists recommended that multiple tools including plant disease resistance in crops, conservation of natural enemies (parasitoids and predators) to provide biological pest control, and companion planting such as with aromatic forbs to repel pests should be used to achieve &quot;sustainable&quot; protection of crops. They considered a multitrophic approach that took into account the many interactions between crops, companion plants, herbivorous pests, and their natural enemies essential. Many studies have looked at the effects of plants on crop pests, but relatively few interactions have been studied in depth or using field trials.

== Mechanisms ==

Companion planting can help to increase crop productivity through a variety of mechanisms, which may sometimes be combined. These include pollination, weed suppression, and pest control, including by providing habitat for beneficial insects. 

Companion planting can reduce insect damage to crops, whether by disrupting pests&#x27; ability to locate crops by sight, or by blocking pests physically; by attracting pests away from a target crop to a sacrificial trap crop; or by masking the odour of a crop, using aromatic companions that release volatile compounds. Other benefits, depending on the companion species used, include fixing nitrogen, attracting beneficial insects, suppressing weeds, reducing root-damaging nematode worms, and maintaining moisture in the soil.

=== Nutrient provision ===

Legumes such as clover provide nitrogen compounds to neighbouring plants such as grasses by fixing nitrogen from the air with symbiotic bacteria in their root nodules. These enable the grasses or other neighbours to produce more protein (with lower inputs of artificial fertiliser) and hence to grow more.

=== Trap cropping ===

Trap cropping uses alternative plants to attract pests away from a main crop. For example, nasturtium (&quot;Tropaeolum majus&quot;) is a food plant of some caterpillars which feed primarily on members of the cabbage family (brassicas); some gardeners claim that planting them around brassicas protects the food crops from damage, as eggs of the pests are preferentially laid on the nasturtium. However, while many trap crops divert pests from focal crops in small scale greenhouse, garden and field experiments, only a small portion of these plants reduce pest damage at larger commercial scales.

=== Host-finding disruption ===

S. Finch and R. H. Collier, in a paper entitled &quot;Insects can see clearly now the weeds have gone&quot;, showed experimentally that flying pests are far less successful if their host-plants are surrounded by other plants or even &quot;decoy-plants&quot; coloured green. Pests find hosts in stages, first detecting plant odours which induce it to try to land on the host plant, avoiding bare soil. If the plant is isolated, then the insect simply lands on the patch of green near the odour, making an &quot;appropriate landing&quot;. If it finds itself on the wrong plant, an &quot;inappropriate landing&quot;, it takes off and flies to another plant; it eventually leaves the area if there are too many &quot;inappropriate&quot; landings. Companion planting of clover as ground cover was equally disruptive to eight pest species from four different insect orders. In a test, 36% of cabbage root flies laid eggs beside cabbages growing in bare soil (destroying the crop), compared to only 7% beside cabbages growing in clover (which allowed a good crop). Simple decoys of green cardboard worked just as well as the live ground cover.

=== Weed suppression ===

Several plants are allelopathic, producing chemicals which inhibit the growth of other species. For example, rye is useful as a cereal crop, and can be used as a cover crop to suppress weeds in companion plantings, or mown and used as a weed-suppressing mulch. Rye produces two phytotoxic substances, [2,4-dihydroxy-1,4(2H)-benzoxazin-3-one (DIBOA) and 2(3H)-benzoxazolinone (BOA)]. These inhibit germination and seedling growth of both grasses and dicotyledonous plants.

=== Pest suppression ===

Some companion plants help prevent pest insects or pathogenic fungi from damaging the crop, through their production of aromatic volatile chemicals, another type of allelopathy. For example, the smell of the foliage of marigolds is claimed to deter aphids from feeding on neighbouring plants. A 2005 study found that oil volatiles extracted from Mexican marigold could suppress the reproduction of three aphid species (pea aphid, green peach aphid and glasshouse and potato aphid) by up to 100% after 5 days from exposure. Another example familiar to gardeners is the interaction of onions and carrots with each other&#x27;s pests: it is popularly believed that the onion smell puts off carrot root fly, while the smell of carrots puts off onion fly. 

Some studies have demonstrated beneficial effects. For instance, cabbage crops can be seriously damaged by the cabbage moth. It has a natural enemy, the parasitoid wasp &quot;Microplitis mediator&quot;. Companion planting of cornflowers among cabbages enables the wasp to increase sufficiently in number to control the moth. This implies the possibility of natural control, with reduced use of insecticides, benefiting the farmer and local biodiversity. In horticulture, marigolds provide good protection to tomato plants against the greenhouse whitefly (an aphid), via the aromatic limonene that they produce. Not all combinations of target and companion are effective; for instance, clover, a useful companion to many crop plants, does not mask &quot;Brassica&quot; crops. 

However, effects on multi-species systems are complex and may not increase crop yields. Thus, French marigold inhibits codling moth, a serious pest whose larva destroys apples, but it also inhibits the moth&#x27;s insect enemies, such as the parasitoid wasp &quot;Ascogaster quadridentata&quot;, an ichneumonid. The result is that the companion planting fails to reduce damage to apples.

=== Predator recruitment ===

Companion plants that produce copious nectar or pollen in a vegetable garden (insectary plants) may help encourage higher populations of beneficial insects that control pests. 

Some companion herbs that produce aromatic volatiles attract natural enemies, which can help to suppress pests. Mint, basil, and marigold all attract herbivorous insects&#x27; enemies, such as generalist predators. For instance, spearmint attracts the mirid bug &quot;Nesidiocoris tenuis&quot;, while basil attracts the green lacewing &quot;Ceraeochrysa cubana&quot;.

The multiple interactions between the plant species, and between them, pest species, and the pests&#x27; natural enemies, are complex and not well understood. A 2019 field study in Brazil found that companion planting with parsley among a target crop of collard greens helped to suppress aphid pests (&quot;Brevicoryne brassicae&quot;, &quot;Myzus persicae&quot;), even though it also cut down the numbers of parasitoid wasps. Predatory insect species increased in numbers, and may have predated on the aphid-killing parasitoids, while the reduction in aphids may have been caused by the increased numbers of generalist predators.

=== Protective shelter === 

Some crops are grown under the protective shelter of different kinds of plant, whether as wind breaks or for shade. For example, shade-grown coffee, especially &quot;Coffea arabica&quot;, has traditionally been grown in light shade created by scattered trees with a thin canopy, allowing light through to the coffee bushes but protecting them from overheating. Suitable Asian trees include &quot;Erythrina subumbrans&quot; (tton tong or dadap), &quot;Gliricidia sepium&quot; (khae falang), &quot;Cassia siamea&quot; (khi lek), &quot;Melia azedarach&quot; (khao dao sang), and &quot;Paulownia tomentosa&quot;, a useful timber tree.

== Approaches ==

Companion planting approaches in use or being trialled include:

* Square foot gardening attempts to protect plants from issues such as weed infestation by packing them as closely together as possible. This is facilitated by using companion plants, which can be closer together than normal.
* Forest gardening, where companion plants are intermingled to simulate an ecosystem, emulates the interaction of plants of up to seven different heights in a woodland.

<text>Sarpedon (; ) is the name of several figures in Greek mythology
* Sarpedon, a son of Zeus, who fought on the side of Troy in the Trojan War. Although in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, he was the son of Zeus and Laodamia, the daughter of Bellerophon, in the later standard tradition, he was the son of Zeus and Europa, and the brother of Minos and Rhadamanthus, while in other accounts the Sarpedon who fought at Troy was the grandson of the Sarpedon who was the brother of Minos.
* Sarpedon, a Thracian son of Poseidon, eponym of Cape Sarpedon near the outlet of the River Hebrus, and brother to Poltys, King of Aenus. Unlike the other two Sarpedons, this Thracian Sarpedon was not a hero, but an insolent individual who was shot to death by Heracles as the latter was sailing away from Aenus.

<text>In Greek mythology, Patroclus (generally pronounced ; ) was a Greek hero of the Trojan War and an important character in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;. Born in Opus, Patroclus was the son of the Argonaut Menoetius. When he was a child, he was exiled from his hometown and was adopted by Peleus, king of Phthia. There, he was raised alongside Peleus&#x27; son, Achilles, a childhood friend, who became a close wartime companion. When the tide of the war turned against the Achaeans, Patroclus, disguised as Achilles and defying his orders to retreat in time, led the Myrmidons in battle against the Trojans and was eventually killed by the Trojan prince, Hector. Enraged by Patroclus&#x27;s death, Achilles ended his refusal to fight, resulting in significant Greek victories.

==Name==
The Latinized name Patroclus derives from the Ancient Greek &quot;Pátroklos&quot; (), meaning &quot;glory of his father,&quot; from (&quot;patḗr&quot;, &quot;father&quot; stem &quot;pátr&quot;-) and (&quot;kléos&quot;, &quot;glory&quot;). A variation of the name with the same components in different order is &quot;&quot;, while the feminine form of the name is &quot;Cleopatra.&quot;

There are at least three pronunciations of the name &#x27;Patroclus&#x27; in English. Because the penultimate syllable is light in Latin prose (&quot;pă′.trŏ.clŭs&quot;), the antepenult was stressed in Latin and would normally be stressed in English as well, for (analogous to &#x27;Sophocles&#x27;). However, this pronunciation is seldom encountered: for metrical convenience, Alexander Pope had made the &#x27;o&#x27; long, and thus stressed, in his translation of Homer, following a convention of Greek and Latin verse, and that pronunciation – of Latin &quot;pa.trō′.clus&quot; – has stuck, for English . 
Moreover, because in prose, a penultimate Greco-Latin short &quot;o&quot; (omicron) would only be stressed in a closed syllable, the penult has sometimes been misanalysed as being closed (*pă.trŏc′.lŭs), which would change the English &quot;o&quot; to a short vowel: .

== Description and family ==
In the account of Dares the Phrygian, Patroclus was illustrated as &quot;... handsome and powerfully built. His eyes were gray. He was modest, dependable, wise, a man richly endowed.&quot; 

Patroclus was the son of Menoetius (hence called &quot;Menoetiades&quot; , meaning &quot;son of Menoetius&quot;) by either Philomela or Polymele, Sthenele, Periopis, or lastly Damocrateia. His only sibling was Myrto, mother of Eucleia by Heracles. Homer also references Menoetius as the individual who gave Patroclus to Peleus. Menoetius was the son of Actor, king of Opus in Locris, by Aegina, daughter of Asopus. Patroclus was Achilles&#x27;s first cousin once removed through their paternal family connection to Aegina, as Achilles was the son of Peleus and grandson of Aeacus, son of Aegina by Zeus.

== Mythology ==
=== Early days ===

During his childhood, Patroclus had accidentally killed his playmate Clysonymus over a game of dice. As a result, he was exiled from his home, Opus, with Menoetius sending him to Peleus, king of Phthia and father of Achilles. Peleus named Patroclus Achilles&#x27;s &quot;squire&quot;, as they both grew up together and became close friends. Patroclus acted as a male role model for Achilles, being both kinder than him as well as wiser regarding counsel. Patroclus&#x27;s early life, including his flight to the house of Peleus, is narrated later in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, when his ghost appears to Achilles reminding him about his past and giving him advice about his burial.

According to Photius, Ptolemy Hephaestion (probably referring to Ptolemy Chennus) wrote that Patroclus was also loved by the sea god Poseidon, who taught him the art of riding horses.

=== Trojan War ===

According to the &quot;Iliad&quot;, when the tide of the Trojan War had turned against the Greeks and the Trojans were threatening their ships, Patroclus convinced Achilles to let him lead the Myrmidons into combat. Achilles consented, giving Patroclus the armor Achilles had received from his father in order for Patroclus to impersonate Achilles. Achilles then told Patroclus to return after beating the Trojans back from their ships.

Patroclus defied Achilles&#x27;s order and pursued the Trojans back to the gates of Troy. Patroclus killed many Trojans and Trojan allies, including a son of Zeus, Sarpedon. While fighting, Patroclus&#x27;s wits were removed by Apollo, after which the spear of Euphorbos hit Patroclus. Hector then kills Patroclus by stabbing him in the stomach with a spear.
Achilles retrieved his body, which had been stripped of armor by Hector and protected on the battlefield by Menelaus and Ajax. Achilles did not allow the burial of Patroclus&#x27;s body until the ghost of Patroclus appeared and demanded his burial in order to pass into Hades.
Patroclus was then cremated on a funeral pyre, which was covered in the hair of his sorrowful companions. As the cutting of hair was a sign of grief while also acting as a sign of the separation of the living and the dead, this points to how well-liked Patroclus had been. The ashes of Achilles were said to have been buried in a golden urn along with those of Patroclus by the Hellespont.

== Relationship with Achilles ==

Although there is no explicit sexual relationship between Achilles and Patroclus in the Homeric tradition, a few later Greek authors wrote about what they saw as implied in the text regarding their relationship. Aeschylus and Phaedrus, for example, state there was a clear relationship between them. Aeschylus refers to Achilles as the erastes, while Phaedrus refers to Achilles as the eromenos of the relationship. Morales and Mariscal state, &quot;There is a polemical tradition concerning the nature of the relationship between the two heroes.&quot;
According to Ledbetter (1993), there is a train of thought that Patroclus could have been a representation of the compassionate side of Achilles, who was known for his rage, mentioned in the first line of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;. Ledbetter connects the way that Achilles and his mother, Thetis, communicate to the link between Achilles and Patroclus. Ledbetter does so by comparing how Thetis comforts the weeping Achilles in Book 1 of the &quot;Iliad&quot; to how Achilles comforts Patroclus as he weeps in Book 16. Achilles uses a simile containing a young girl tearfully looking at her mother to complete the comparison. Ledbetter believes this puts Patroclus into a subordinate role to that of Achilles. However, as Patroclus is explicitly stated to be the elder of the two characters, this is not evidence of their ages or social relation to each other.

James Hooker describes the literary reasons for Patroclus&#x27;s character within the &quot;Iliad&quot;. He states that another character could have filled the role of confidant for Achilles and that it was only through Patroclus that we have a worthy reason for Achilles&#x27;s wrath. Hooker claims that without the death of Patroclus, an event that weighed heavily upon him, Achilles&#x27;s following act of compliance to fight would have disrupted the balance of the &quot;Iliad&quot;. 

Hooker describes the necessity of Patroclus sharing a deep affection with Achilles within the &quot;Iliad&quot;. According to his theory, this affection allows an even more profound tragedy to occur. Hooker argues that the greater the love, the greater the loss. Hooker continues to negate Ledbetter&#x27;s theory that Patroclus is in some way a surrogate for Achilles; rather, Hooker views Patroclus&#x27;s character as a counterpart to that of Achilles. Hooker reminds us that it is Patroclus who pushes the Trojans back, which Hooker claims makes Patroclus a hero, as well as foreshadowing what Achilles is to do.

Achilles and Patroclus grew up together after Menoitios gave Patroclus to Achilles&#x27;s father, Peleus. During this time, Peleus made Patroclus one of Achilles&#x27;s &quot;henchmen.&quot; While Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; never explicitly stated that Achilles and Patroclus were lovers, this concept was propounded by some later authors.
Aeschines asserts that there was no need to explicitly state the relationship as a romantic one, for such &quot;is manifest to such of his hearers as are educated men.&quot; In later Greek writings, such as Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot;, the relationship between Patroclus and Achilles is discussed as a model of romantic love. However, Xenophon, in his &quot;Symposium&quot;, had Socrates argue that it was inaccurate to label their relationship as romantic. Nevertheless, their relationship is said to have inspired Alexander the Great in his own close relationship with his life-long companion Hephaestion.

In the &quot;Iliad,&quot; Achilles was younger than Patroclus. This reinforces Dowden&#x27;s explanation of the relationship between an eromenos, a youth in transition, and an &quot;erastes&quot;, an older male who had recently made the same transition. Dowden also notes the common occurrence of such relationships as a form of initiation. However, Statius in the &quot;Achilleid&quot; states that the two were either within the same age group or acted as if they were.

Patroclus is a character in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;. In the play, Achilles, who has become lazy, is besotted with Patroclus, and the other characters complain that Achilles and Patroclus are too busy having sex to fight in the war.

<text>In Greek mythology, Polymestor or Polymnestor () was a king of the Bistonians in Thrace. Polymestor appears in Euripides&#x27; play &quot;Hecuba&quot; and in the Ovidian myth &quot;Hecuba, Polyxena and Polydorus&quot;. Polymestor was also the name of a Greek king of Arcadia.

== Family ==
Polymestor was the husband of Ilione, the eldest daughter of King Priam and Queen Hecuba of Troy. The couple had only one son, Deipylus.

== Mythology ==
During the Trojan War, King Priam was frightened for his youngest son Polydorus&#x27;s safety since Polydorus could not fight for himself. Priam sent the child, along with gifts of jewelry and gold, to the court of King Polymestor to keep him away from the fighting. After Troy fell, Polymestor betrayed Priam and threw Polydorus into the ocean in order to keep the treasures for himself.

Hecuba, Polydorus&#x27; mother, found the body and discovered the treachery. She asked Agamemnon to bring Polymestor to her. Agamemnon complied, motivated by his love of Cassandra, another of Hecuba&#x27;s children. Hecuba baits Polymestor by drawing him in with treasure. Hecuba has the other Trojan women kill Polymestor&#x27;s sons, and blinds Polymestor by scratching his eyes out. Polymestor is humiliated at having been blinded and made childless at the hands of slave women. Polymestor is given a trial against Hecuba by Agamemnon. Polymestor claims to have been working in the Greeks&#x27; interest by killing Polydorus before he could avenge his brothers and father. Hecuba refutes this claim by stating that the Greeks have no interest in allying with barbarians. Agamemnon sides with Hecuba and declares Polymestor&#x27;s actions to be murder. Agamemnon has his soldiers seize Polymestor. As he is being taken away, Polymestor prophesies the deaths of Cassandra, the daughter of Hecuba, and Agamemnon.

<text>In Greek mythology, Labdacus (, &quot;Lábdakos&quot;) was the only son of Polydorus and a king of Thebes. Labdacus was a grandson of Thebes&#x27; founder, Cadmus. His mother was Nycteïs, daughter of Nycteus. 

== Mythology ==
Polydorus died while Labdacus was a child, leaving Nycteus as his regent, although Lycus soon replaced him in that office. When Labdacus had grown, he briefly ruled Thebes. He died while he was still young, after he lost a war with the king of Athens, Pandion, over their borders. Apollodorus writes that he, like his cousin Pentheus, was ripped apart by women in a bacchic frenzy for disrespect to the god Dionysus. Lycus became regent once more after his death, this time for Labdacus&#x27; son, Laius. His descendants were called the &quot;Labdacids&quot;, and included his son Laius, who fathered Oedipus; Oedipus&#x27; children were Polynices, Eteocles, Antigone, and Ismene.

<text>A pulsejet engine (or pulse jet) is a type of jet engine in which combustion occurs in pulses. A pulsejet engine can be made with few or no moving parts, and is capable of running statically (that is, it does not need to have air forced into its inlet, typically by forward motion). The best known example is the Argus As 109-014 used to propel Nazi Germany&#x27;s V-1 flying bomb.

Pulsejet engines are a lightweight form of jet propulsion, but usually have a poor compression ratio, and hence give a low specific impulse.

The two main types of pulsejet engines use resonant combustion and harness the combustion products to form a pulsating exhaust jet that intermittently produces thrust. 

The traditional valved pulsejet has one-way valves through which incoming air passes. When the fuel mix is ignited, the valves close, which means that the heated gases can only leave through the engine&#x27;s tailpipe, thus creating forward thrust. 

The second type is the valveless pulsejet. The technical terms for this engine are acoustic-type pulsejet, or aerodynamically valved pulsejet.

One notable line of research includes the pulse detonation engine, which involves repeated detonations in the engine, and which can potentially give high compression and reasonably good efficiency.

==History==
Russian inventor and retired artillery officer Nikolaj Afanasievich Teleshov patented a steam pulsejet engine in 1867 while Swedish inventor Martin Wiberg also has a claim to having invented the first pulsejet, in Sweden, but details are unclear.

The first working pulsejet was patented in 1906 by Russian engineer V.V. Karavodin, who completed a working model in 1907. 

French inventor Georges Marconnet patented his valveless pulsejet engine in 1908. It was the grandfather of all valveless pulsejets. The valveless pulsejet was experimented with by French propulsion research group Société Nationale d&#x27;Étude et de Construction de Moteurs d&#x27;Aviation (SNECMA), in the late 1940s.

Ramón Casanova, in Ripoll, Spain patented a pulsejet in Barcelona in 1917, having constructed one beginning in 1913. Robert Goddard invented a pulsejet engine in 1931, and demonstrated it on a jet-propelled bicycle. Engineer Paul Schmidt pioneered a more efficient design based on modification of the intake valves (or flaps), earning him government support from the German Air Ministry in 1933.

The valveless pulsejet&#x27;s first widespread use was the Dutch drone Aviolanda AT-21

===Argus As 109-014===

In 1934, Georg Hans Madelung and Munich-based Paul Schmidt proposed to the German Air Ministry a &quot;flying bomb&quot; powered by Schmidt&#x27;s pulsejet. Schmidt&#x27;s prototype bomb was rejected by the German Air Ministry as they were uninterested in it from a tactical perspective and assessed it as being technically dubious. The original Schmidt design had the pulsejet placed in a fuselage like a modern jet fighter, unlike the eventual V-1, which had the engine placed above the warhead and fuselage.

The Argus Company began work based on Schmidt&#x27;s work. Other German manufacturers working on similar pulsejets and flying bombs were The Askania Company, Robert Lusser of Fieseler, Dr. Fritz Gosslau of Argus and the Siemens company, which were all combined to work on the V-1.

With Schmidt now working for Argus, the pulsejet was perfected and was officially known by its RLM designation as the Argus As 109-014. The first unpowered drop occurred at Peenemünde on 28 October 1942, the first powered flight on 10 December 1942 and the first powered launch on 24 December 1942.

The pulsejet was evaluated to be an excellent balance of cost and function: a simple design that performed well for minimal cost. It would run on any grade of petroleum and the ignition shutter system was not intended to last beyond the V-1&#x27;s normal operational flight life of one hour. Although it generated insufficient thrust for takeoff, the V-1&#x27;s resonant jet could operate while stationary on the launch ramp. The simple resonant design based on the ratio (8.7:1) of the diameter to the length of the exhaust pipe functioned to perpetuate the combustion cycle, and attained stable resonance frequency at 43 cycles per second. The engine produced of static thrust and approximately in flight.

Ignition in the As 014 was provided by a single automotive spark plug, mounted approximately behind the front-mounted valve array. The spark only operated for the start sequence for the engine; the Argus As 014, like all pulsejets, did not require ignition coils or magnetos for ignition — the ignition source being the tail of the preceding fireball during the run. The engine casing did not provide sufficient heat to cause diesel-type ignition of the fuel, as there is insignificant compression within a pulsejet engine.

The Argus As 014 valve array was based on a shutter system that operated at 47 cycles-per-second.

Three air nozzles in the front of the Argus As 014 were connected to an external high pressure source to start the engine. The fuel used for ignition was acetylene, with the technicians having to place a baffle of wood or cardboard in the exhaust pipe to stop the acetylene diffusing before complete ignition. Once the engine ignited and minimum operating temperature was attained, external hoses and connectors were removed.

The V-1, being a cruise missile, lacked landing gear, instead the Argus As 014 was launched on an inclined ramp powered by a piston-driven steam catapult. Steam power to fire the piston was generated by the violent exothermic chemical reaction created when hydrogen peroxide and potassium permanganate (termed T-Stoff and Z-Stoff) are combined.

The principal military use of the pulsejet engine, with the volume production of the Argus As 014 unit (the first pulsejet engine ever in volume production), was for use with the V-1 flying bomb. The engine&#x27;s characteristic droning noise earned it the nicknames &quot;buzz bomb&quot; or &quot;doodlebug&quot;. The V-1 was a German cruise missile used in World War II, most famously in the bombing of London in 1944. Pulsejet engines, being cheap and easy to construct, were the obvious choice for the V-1&#x27;s designers, given the Germans&#x27; materials shortages and overstretched industry at that stage of the war. Designers of modern cruise missiles do not choose pulsejet engines for propulsion, preferring turbojets or rocket engines. The only other uses of the pulsejet that reached the hardware stage in Nazi Germany were the Messerschmitt Me 328 and an experimental Einpersonenfluggerät project for the German Heer.

Wright Field technical personnel reverse-engineered the V-1 from the remains of one that had failed to detonate in Britain. The result was the creation of the JB-2 Loon, with the airframe built by Republic Aviation, and the Argus As 014 reproduction pulsejet powerplant, known by its PJ31 American designation, being made by the Ford Motor Company.

General Hap Arnold of the United States Army Air Forces was concerned that this weapon could be built of steel and wood, in 2000 man hours and approximate cost of .

In 2024 University of Maryland spinoff Wave Engine Corporation delivered four of its J-1 engines to a customer. J-1 is a digitally controlled pulsejet engine for use in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

==Design==
Pulsejet engines are characterized by simplicity, low cost of construction, and high noise levels. While the thrust-to-weight ratio is excellent, thrust specific fuel consumption is very poor. The pulsejet uses the Lenoir cycle, which, lacking an external compressive driver such as the Otto cycle&#x27;s piston, or the Brayton cycle&#x27;s compression turbine, drives compression with acoustic resonance in a tube. This limits the maximum pre-combustion pressure ratio, to around 1.2 to 1.

The high noise levels usually make them impractical for other than military and other similarly restricted applications. However, pulsejets are used on a large scale as industrial drying systems, and there has been a resurgence in studying these engines for applications such as high-output heating, biomass conversion, and alternative energy systems, as pulsejets can run on almost anything that burns, including particulate fuels such as sawdust or coal powder.

Pulsejets have been used to power experimental helicopters, the engines being attached to the ends of the rotor blades. In providing power to helicopter rotors, pulsejets have the advantage over turbine or piston engines of not producing torque upon the fuselage since they don&#x27;t apply force to the shaft, but push the tips. A helicopter may then be built without a tail rotor and its associated transmission and drive shaft, simplifying the aircraft (cyclic and collective control of the main rotor is still necessary). This concept was being considered as early as 1947 when the American Helicopter Company started work on its XA-5 Top Sergeant helicopter prototype powered by pulsejet engines at the rotor tips. The XA-5 first flew in January 1949 and was followed by the XA-6 Buck Private with the same pulsejet design. Also in 1949 Hiller Helicopters built and tested the Hiller Powerblade, the world&#x27;s first hot-cycle pressure-jet rotor. Hiller switched to tip mounted ramjets but American Helicopter went on to develop the XA-8 under a U.S. Army contract. It first flew in 1952 and was known as the XH-26 Jet Jeep. It used XPJ49 pulsejets mounted at the rotor tips. The XH-26 met all its main design objectives but the Army cancelled the project because of the unacceptable level of noise of the pulsejets and the fact that the drag of the pulsejets at the rotor tips made autorotation landings very problematic. Rotor-tip propulsion has been claimed to reduce the cost of production of rotary-wing craft to 1/10 of that for conventional powered rotary-wing aircraft.

Pulsejets have also been used in both control-line and radio-controlled model aircraft. The speed record for control-line pulsejet-powered model aircraft is greater than 200 miles per hour (322 km/h).

The speed of a free-flying radio-controlled pulsejet is limited by the engine&#x27;s intake design. At around 450 km/h (280 mph) most valved engines&#x27; valve systems stop fully closing owing to ram air pressure, which results in performance loss.

Variable intake geometry lets the engine produce full power at most speeds by optimizing for whatever speed at which the air enters the pulsejet. Valveless designs are not as negatively affected by ram air pressure as other designs, as they were never intended to stop the flow out of the intake, and can significantly increase in power at speed.

Another feature of pulsejet engines is that their thrust can be increased by a specially shaped duct placed behind the engine. The duct acts as an annular wing, which evens out the pulsating thrust, by harnessing aerodynamic forces in the pulsejet exhaust. The duct, typically called an augmentor, can significantly increase the thrust of a pulsejet with no additional fuel consumption. Gains of 100% increases in thrust are possible, resulting in a much higher fuel efficiency. However, the larger the augmenter duct, the more drag it produces, and it is only effective within specific speed ranges.

J-1 is a u-shaped device designed for UAVs with up to 200-lb (90-kg) gross vehicle weight. It weighs 18 lb (8.2 kg) and measures 5.5 x 12.5 x 64 inches (14 x 32 x 163 cm). It can run on fuels such as gasoline, E85 bioethanol, or jet fuel. Its thrust reaches up to . When fuel ignites, the increased temperature and pressure push hot gasses out of the device, creating thrust. The resulting partial vacuum pulls in fresh air, preparing for the next pulse. The engine family has been tested at up to .

Wave is working on a second engine, the K-1, with up to of thrust for up to . It claims that this will benefit larger commercial applications and a new class of VTOL.

==Operation==
===Valved designs===
Valved pulsejet engines use a mechanical valve to control the flow of expanding exhaust, forcing the hot gas to go out of the back of the engine through the tailpipe only, and allow fresh air and more fuel to enter through the intake as the inertia of the escaping exhaust creates a partial vacuum for a fraction of a second after each detonation. This draws in additional air and fuel between pulses.

The valved pulsejet comprises an intake with a one-way valve arrangement. The valves prevent the explosive gas of the ignited fuel mixture in the combustion chamber from exiting and disrupting the intake airflow, although with all practical valved pulsejets there is some &#x27;blowback&#x27; while running statically or at low speed, as the valves cannot close fast enough to prevent some gas from exiting through the intake. The superheated exhaust gases exit through an acoustically resonant exhaust pipe.

The intake valve is typically a reed valve. The two most common configurations are the daisy valve, and the rectangular valve grid. A daisy valve consists of a thin sheet of material to act as the reed, cut into the shape of a stylized daisy with &quot;petals&quot; that widen towards their ends. Each &quot;petal&quot; covers a circular intake hole at its tip. The daisy valve is bolted to the manifold through its centre. Although easier to construct on a small scale, it is less effective than a valve grid.

The cycle frequency is primarily dependent on the length of the engine. For a small model-type engine the frequency may be around 250 pulses per second, whereas for a larger engine such as the one used on the German V-1 flying bomb, the frequency was closer to 45 pulses per second. The low-frequency sound produced resulted in the missiles being nicknamed &quot;buzz bombs.&quot;

===Valveless designs===
Valveless pulsejet engines have no moving parts and use only their geometry to control the flow of exhaust out of the engine. Valveless pulsejets expel exhaust out of both the intakes and the exhaust, but the majority of the force produced leaves through the wider cross section of the exhaust. The larger amount of mass leaving the wider exhaust has more inertia than the backwards flow out of the intake, allowing it to produce a partial vacuum for a fraction of a second after each detonation, reversing the flow of the intake to its proper direction, and therefore ingesting more air and fuel. This happens dozens of times per second.

The valveless pulsejet operates on the same principle as the valved pulsejet, but the &#x27;valve&#x27; is the engine&#x27;s geometry. Fuel, as a gas or atomized liquid spray, is either mixed with the air in the intake or directly injected into the combustion chamber. Starting the engine usually requires forced air and an ignition source, such as a spark plug, for the fuel-air mix. With modern manufactured engine designs, almost any design can be made to be self-starting by providing the engine with fuel and an ignition spark, starting the engine with no compressed air. Once running, the engine only requires input of fuel to maintain a self-sustaining combustion cycle.

The combustion cycle comprises five or six phases depending on the engine: Induction, Compression, Fuel Injection (optional), Ignition, Combustion, and Exhaust.

Starting with ignition within the combustion chamber, a high pressure is raised by the combustion of the fuel-air mixture. 

The inertial reaction of this gas flow causes the engine to provide thrust, this force being used to propel an airframe or a rotor blade. The inertia of the traveling exhaust gas causes a low pressure in the combustion chamber. This pressure is less than the inlet pressure (upstream of the one-way valve), and so the induction phase of the cycle begins.

In the simplest of pulsejet engines this intake is through a venturi, which causes fuel to be drawn from a fuel supply. In more complex engines the fuel may be injected directly into the combustion chamber. When the induction phase is under way, fuel in atomized form is injected into the combustion chamber to fill the vacuum formed by the departing of the previous fireball; the atomized fuel tries to fill up the entire tube including the tailpipe. This causes atomized fuel at the rear of the combustion chamber to &quot;flash&quot; as it comes in contact with the hot gases of the preceding column of gas—this resulting flash &quot;slams&quot; the reed-valves shut or in the case of valveless designs, stops the flow of fuel until a vacuum is formed and the cycle repeats.

Valveless pulsejets come in a number of shapes and sizes, with different designs being suited for different functions. A typical valveless engine will have one or more intake tubes, a combustion chamber section, and one or more exhaust tube sections.

The intake tube takes in air and mixes it with fuel to combust, and also controls the expulsion of exhaust gas, like a valve, limiting the flow but not stopping it altogether. While the fuel-air mixture burns, most of the expanding gas is forced out of the exhaust pipe of the engine. Because the intake tube(s) also expel gas during the exhaust cycle of the engine, most valveless engines have the intakes facing backwards so that the thrust created adds to the overall thrust, rather than reducing it.

The combustion creates two pressure wave fronts, one traveling down the longer exhaust tube and one down the short intake tube. By properly &#x27;tuning&#x27; the system (by designing the engine dimensions properly), a resonating combustion process can be achieved.

While some valveless engines are known for being extremely fuel-hungry, other designs use significantly less fuel than a valved pulsejet, and a properly designed system with advanced components and techniques can rival or exceed the fuel efficiency of small turbojet engines.

A properly designed valveless engine will excel in flight as it does not have valves, and ram air pressure from traveling at high speed does not cause the engine to stop running like a valved engine. They can achieve higher top speeds, with some advanced designs being capable of operating at Mach .7 or possibly higher.

The advantage of the acoustic-type pulsejet is simplicity. Since there are no moving parts to wear out, they are easier to maintain and simpler to construct.

===Future uses===

Pulsejets are used today in target drone aircraft, flying control line model aircraft (as well as radio-controlled aircraft), fog generators, and industrial drying and home heating equipment. Because pulsejets are an efficient and simple way to convert fuel into heat, experimenters are using them for new industrial applications such as biomass fuel conversion, and boiler and heater systems.

Some experimenters continue to work on improved designs. The engines are difficult to integrate into commercial crewed aircraft designs because of noise and vibration, though they excel on the smaller-scale uncrewed vehicles.

The pulse detonation engine (PDE) marks a new approach towards non-continuous jet engines and promises higher fuel efficiency compared to turbofan jet engines, at least at very high speeds. Pratt &amp; Whitney and General Electric now have active PDE research programs. Most PDE research programs use pulsejet engines for testing ideas early in the design phase.

Boeing has a proprietary pulsejet engine technology called Pulse Ejector Thrust Augmentor (PETA), which proposes to use pulsejet engines for vertical lift in military and commercial VTOL aircraft.

<text>In classical antiquity and Greco-Roman geography, Colchis (; ) was an exonym for the Georgian polity of Egrisi () located on the eastern coast of the Black Sea, centered in present-day western Georgia.

Its population, the Colchians, are generally thought to have been mainly an early Kartvelian-speaking tribe ancestral to contemporary western Georgians, namely Svans and Zans. According to David Marshall Lang: &quot;one of the most important elements in the modern Georgian nation, the Colchians were probably established in the Caucasus by the Middle Bronze Age.&quot;

It has been described in modern scholarship as &quot;the earliest Georgian formation&quot;, which, along with the Kingdom of Iberia, would later contribute significantly to the development of the Kingdom of Georgia and the Georgian nation.

Colchis is known in Greek mythology as the destination of the Argonauts, as well as the home to Medea and the Golden Fleece. It was also described as a land rich with gold, iron, timber and honey that would export its resources mostly to ancient Hellenic city-states. Colchis likely had a diverse population. According to Greek and Roman sources, between 70 and 300 languages were spoken in Dioscourias (modern Sokhumi) alone. 

According to Rayfield, the first mention of Colchis is during the reign of the Assyrian king Tukulti-Ninurta I of the Middle Assyrian Empire (1245–1209 BC) when he mentions &quot;40 kings by the Upper [Black] Sea&quot;. Colchis territory is mostly assigned to what is now the western part of Georgia and encompasses the present-day Georgian provinces of Samegrelo, Imereti, Guria, Adjara, Svaneti, Racha; Abkhazia; modern Russia&#x27;s Sochi and Tuapse districts; and present-day Turkey’s Artvin, Rize, and Trabzon provinces.

== Geography and toponyms ==
Colchis, Kolkha, Qulḫa, or Kilkhi, which existed from the to the 1st centuries BC, is regarded as an early ethnically Georgian polity; the name of the Colchians was used as the collective term for early Kartvelian tribes which populated the eastern coast of the Black Sea in Greco-Roman ethnography.

Ronald Grigor Suny identifies Colchis as an early Georgian state formation. Suny emphasizes that the Colchians were among the early Kartvelian-speaking tribes, the linguistic ancestors of modern Georgians. He highlights the cultural and political continuity between Colchis and later Georgian states, noting that Colchis, along with the eastern Georgian kingdom of Iberia, played a significant role in the ethnogenesis of the Georgian people.

According to Donald Rayfield, the ethnic makeup of Colchis is &quot;obscure&quot; and Kartvelian names &quot;are conspicuously absent from the few anthronyms found in Colchian burials.&quot; Instead, Greek, Anatolian, Iranian, and possibly Abkhaz names are present.

The name Colchis is thought to have derived from the Urartian &quot;Qulḫa&quot;. In the mid-eighth century BC, Sarduri II, the King of Urartu, inscribed his victory over &quot;Qulḫa&quot; on a stele; however, the exact location of &quot;Qulḫa&quot; is disputed. Some scholars argue the name &quot;Qulḫa&quot; (Colchís) originally referred to a land to the west of Georgia. Others argue &quot;Qulḫa&quot; may have been located in the south, near modern Göle, Turkey.

According to Levan Gordeziani, while the Greek &quot;Colchis&quot; etymologically descends from Urartian &quot;Qulḫa&quot;, the Greeks may have applied the name to a different region (and/or cultures) than the preceding Urartians had. Further confusion rests in possible differences in the Greeks&#x27; own usage of the name Colchis in political and mythological contexts (i.e. the relationship between &quot;Aia-Colchis&quot; and &quot;the land of Colchis&quot;).

According to the scholar of Caucasian studies Cyril Toumanoff:

According to most Classical-era sources, Colchis was bordered on the south-west by Pontus, on the west by the Black Sea, as far as the river Corax. To its north was the Greater Caucasus, beyond which was Sarmatia. On its east it bordered the Kingdom of Iberia and Montes Moschici (now the Lesser Caucasus). The south of Colchis bordered Armenia. The westward extent of the country is considered differently by different authors: Strabo makes Colchis begin at Trabzon, while Ptolemy, on the other hand, extends Pontus to the Rioni River.

Although some ancient authors consider Dioscurias to be the extreme northern settlement point of Colchians (in an ethnic sense), nevertheless &quot;they consider it as a point located on the territory of non-Colchian tribes (Heniochi, Sanigs)&quot;. Since in a later era the name &quot;Colchians&quot; was organically connected with the name &quot;Lazi&quot;, it should be remembered that Byzantine sources saw the northern limit of the spread of Laz people somewhere between the Phasis (modern. Poti) and Dioscurias&quot;.

The Greek name () is first used to describe a geographic area in the writings of Aeschylus and Pindar. Earlier writers speak of the &quot;Kolchian&quot; () people and their mythical king Aeëtes (), as well as his eponymous city &quot;Aea&quot; or &quot;Aia (&quot;&quot;)&quot;, but don&#x27;t make explicit references to a Kolchis nation or region. The main river was known as the Phasis (now Rioni) and was, according to some writers the southern boundary of Colchis, but more probably flowed through the middle of that country from the Caucasus west into the Euxine, and the Anticites or Atticitus (now Kuban). Arrian mentions many others by name, but they would seem to have been little more than mountain torrents: the most important of them were Charieis, Chobus or Cobus, Singames, Tarsuras, Hippus, Astelephus, Chrysorrhoas, several of which are also noticed by Ptolemy and Pliny. The chief towns were Dioscurias or Dioscuris (under the Romans called Sebastopolis, now Sukhumi) on the seaboard of the Euxine, Sarapana (now Shorapani), Phasis (now Poti), Pityus (now Pitsunda), Apsaros (now Gonio), Surium (now Vani), Archaeopolis (now Nokalakevi), Macheiresis, and Cyta or Cutatisium or Aia (now Kutaisi), the traditional birthplace of Medea. Scylax mentions also Mala or Male, which he, in contradiction to other writers, makes the birthplace of Medea.

== Physical-geographic characteristics ==


In physical geography, Colchis is usually defined as the area east of the Black Sea coast, restricted from the north by the southwestern slopes of the Greater Caucasus, from the south by the northern slopes of the Lesser Caucasus in Georgia and Eastern Black Sea (Karadeniz) Mountains in Turkey, and from the east by Likhi Range, connecting the Greater and the Lesser Caucasus. The central part of the region is Colchis Plain, stretching between Sukhumi and Kobuleti; most of that lies on the elevation below above sea level. Marginal parts of the region are mountains of the Great and the Lesser Caucasus and Likhi Range.

Its territory mostly corresponds to what is now the western part of Georgia and encompasses the present-day Georgian provinces of Samegrelo, Imereti, Guria, Adjara, Abkhazia, Svaneti, Racha; the modern Turkey’s Rize, Trabzon and Artvin provinces (Lazistan, Tao-Klarjeti); and the modern Russia’s Sochi and Tuapse districts.

The climate is mild humid; near Batumi, annual rainfall level reaches , which is the absolute maximum for continental western Eurasia. The dominating natural landscapes of Colchis are temperate rainforests, yet degraded in the plain part of the region; wetlands (along the coastal parts of Colchis Plain); subalpine and alpine meadows.

Colchis has a high proportion of Neogene and Palaeogene relict plants and animals, with the closest relatives in distant parts of the world: five species of Rhododendrons and other evergreen shrubs, wingnuts, Caucasian salamander, Caucasian parsley frog, eight endemic species of lizards from the genus &quot;Darevskia&quot;, the Caucasus adder (&quot;Vipera kaznakovi&quot;), Robert&#x27;s snow vole, and endemic cave shrimp.

== Economy, agriculture and natural resources ==
Millet was the main staple crop in Colchis. Wheat grew in certain regions and was also imported by sea. Similarly, local wines were produced and some wines were brought from overseas. The Colchian plain provided ample grazing land for cattle and horses, with the name of Phasis associated with fine horses. The wetlands were a home for waterfowl, while Colchian pheasants were exported to Rome and became a symbol of excess condemned by Roman moralists. The Colchian hinterland lacked salt and demand was satisfied partially by local production on the coast and partially by imports from the northern coast of the Black Sea.

Colchis provided slaves as a tribute to the Achaemenid Empire and Colchian slaves are also attested in Ancient Greece.

== History ==
=== Prehistory and earliest references ===
The eastern Black Sea region in antiquity was home to the well-developed Bronze Age culture known as the Colchian culture, related to the neighbouring Koban culture, that emerged toward the Middle Bronze Age. In at least some parts of Colchis, the process of urbanization seems to have been well advanced by the end of the second millennium BC. The Colchian Late Bronze Age (fifteenth to eighth century BC) saw the development of significant skill in the smelting and casting of metals. Sophisticated farming implements were made, and fertile, well-watered lowlands and a mild climate promoted the growth of progressive agricultural techniques.

The earliest attestations of the name of Colchis can be found in the 8th century Greek poet Eumelus of Corinth as and earlier, in Urartian records as mentioned by the Urartian kings, who conquered it in 744 or 743 BC before the Urartians and their territories were themselves conquered by the Neo-Assyrian Empire.

According to Svante Cornell, &quot;What could be conceived as the proto Georgian statehood emerged mainly in the Western parts of today&#x27;s Georgia, with the kingdom of Colchis (&quot;Kolkheti&quot;) in the sixth century BC.&quot;

Colchis was inhabited by a number of tribes whose settlements lay along the shore of the Black Sea. Chief among those were the Machelones, Heniochi, Zydretae, Lazi, Chalybes, Tibareni/Tubal, Mossynoeci, Macrones, Moschi, Marres, Apsilae, Abasci, Sanigae, Coraxi, Coli, Melanchlaeni, Geloni and Soani (Suani). The ancients assigned various origins to the tribes that inhabited Colchis.

Herodotus regarded the Colchians as &quot;dark-skinned () and woolly-haired&quot; and calls them Egyptians. Herodotus states that the Colchians, with the Ancient Egyptians and the Ethiopians, were the first to practice circumcision, a custom which he claims that the Colchians inherited from remnants of the army of Pharaoh Sesostris (Senusret III). Herodotus writes:

These claims have been widely rejected by modern historians. It is in doubt if Herodotus had ever been to Colchis or Egypt, and no Egyptian army ever set foot in the Caucasus, a region shielded by states to the south of the Caucasus too powerful for any Egyptian army to pass through, such as Urartu, Hittia, Assyria and Mitanni.

According to Pliny the Elder:

Many modern theories suggest that the ancestors of the Laz-Mingrelians constituted the dominant ethnic and cultural presence in the region in antiquity, and hence played a significant role in the ethnogenesis of the modern Georgians.

Pausanias, a 1st-century BC Greek geographer, citing the poet Eumelos, assigned Aeëtes, the mythological first king of Colchis, a Greek origin.

=== Persian rule ===
The tribes living in the southern Colchis (Macrones, Moschi, and Marres) were incorporated into Persia and formed the 19th satrapy, while the northern tribes submitted &quot;voluntarily&quot; and had to send to the Persian court 100 girls and 100 boys every five years. In 400 BC, shortly after the Ten Thousand reached Trapezus, a battle was fought between them and the Colchis in which the latter were decisively defeated. The influence exerted on Colchis by the vast Achaemenid Empire with its thriving commerce and wide economic and commercial ties with other regions accelerated the socio-economic development of the Colchian land.

Subsequently, the Colchis people appear to have overthrown the Persian Authority, and to have formed an independent state. According to Ronald Suny this western Georgian state was federated to Kartli-Iberia, and its kings ruled through &quot;skeptoukhi&quot; (royal governors) who received a staff from the king. According to David Braund&#x27;s reading of Strabo&#x27;s account, the native Colchian dynasty continued ruling the country in spite of its fragmentation into &quot;skeptoukhies&quot;.

Gocha R. Tsetskhladze explains that although Colchis and neighboring Iberia were once viewed as not having been under Achaemenid rule, &quot;ever more evidence is emerging to show that they were, forming a lesser part of the Armenian satrapy&quot;.

=== Under Pontus ===
Mithridates VI quelled an uprising in the region in 83 BC and gave Colchis to his son Mithridates, who, soon being suspected in having plotted against his father, was executed. During the Third Mithridatic War, Mithridates VI made another of his sons, Machares, king of Bosporus and Colchis, who held his power, but only for a short period. On the defeat of Mithridates VI of Pontus in 65 BC, Colchis was occupied by Pompey, who captured one of the local chiefs (sceptuchus) Olthaces, and installed Aristarchus as a &quot;dynast&quot; (63–47 BC). On the fall of Pompey, Pharnaces II, son of Mithridates, took advantage of Julius Caesar being occupied in Egypt, and reduced Colchis, Armenia, and some part of Cappadocia, defeating Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus, whom Caesar subsequently sent against him. His triumph was, however, short-lived. Under Polemon I, the son and heir of Zenon, Colchis was part of the Pontus and the Bosporan Kingdom. After the death of Polemon (8 BC), his second wife Pythodorida of Pontus retained possession of Colchis as well as of Pontus, although the kingdom of Bosporus was wrested from her power. Her son and successor, Polemon II of Pontus, was induced by Emperor Nero to abdicate the throne, and both Pontus and Colchis were incorporated in the Province of Galatia (63) and later, in Cappadocia (81). Phasis, Dioscurias and other Greek settlements of the coast did not fully recover after the wars of 60-40 BC and Trebizond became the economical and political centre of the region.

=== Under Roman rule ===

Despite the fact that all major fortresses along the sea coast were occupied by the Romans, their rule was relatively loose. In 69, the people of Pontus and Colchis under Anicetus staged a major uprising against the Roman Empire, which ended unsuccessfully. The lowlands and coastal area were frequently raided by fierce mountain tribes, with the Svaneti and Heniochi being the most powerful of them. Paying a nominal homage to Rome, they created their own kingdoms and enjoyed significant independence.

Under Hadrian, the Romans established relations with Colchian tribes. Hadrian sent his advisor, Arrian, to tour Colchis and Iberia. Arrian depicted a turbulent fluctuation of tribal powers and boundaries, with various hostile and anarchic tribes in the area. The Laz controlled most of coastal Colchis, while other tribes such as the Sanigs and Abasgoi escaped Roman jurisdiction. Other tribes, like the Apsilae, were becoming powerful and their king with the Romanised name Julianus was recognized by Trajan. Arrian listed the following peoples in his Periplus of the Euxine Sea written in 130-131 (from south to north): Sanni, Machelones, Heniochi, Zudreitae, Lazi, Apsilae, Abasgoi, Sanigs and Zilchi.

According to traditional accounts Christianity began to spread in the early first century by Andrew the Apostle, Simon the Zealot, and Saint Matthias. A change in burial patterns in the 3rd century was possibly due to Christian influence. The Hellenistic civilization, local paganism and Mithraic Mysteries would, however, remain widespread until the fourth century. Goths, dwelling in the Crimea and looking for new homes, raided Colchis in 253, but were repulsed with the help of the Roman garrison of Pitsunda. By the first century BC, the Lazica (or the Laz) kingdom was established in the region. Lazica became known as Egrisi in 66 BC when Egrisi became a vassal of the Roman Empire after the Caucasian campaign of Pompey.

==Numismatics==
Colchian coins, the oldest of which were dated to the middle of the 6th century BC, served as the primary source of evidence for the Colchian state. A reassessment of the coins, however, has revealed that these early &quot;Colchian&quot; coins actually represent the production of a Achaemenid satrapy.
== Rulers ==
Little is known of the rulers of Colchis.

==In mythology==
From the fifth century B.C.E. onwards, Colchis was identified as Aea, the mythical home of Aeëtes, Medea, the Golden Fleece, and the fire-breathing Colchis bulls and was the destination of the Argonauts.

Colchis also is thought to be a possible homeland of the Amazons. Amazons also were said to be of Scythian origin from Colchis.

According to the Greek mythology, Colchis was a fabulously wealthy land situated on the mysterious periphery of the heroic world. Here in the sacred grove of the war god Ares, King Aeëtes hung the Golden Fleece until it was seized by Jason and the Argonauts. Colchis was also the land where the mythological Prometheus was punished by being chained to a mountain while an eagle ate at his liver for revealing to humanity the secret of fire.

Apollonius of Rhodes named Aea as the main city (&quot;Argonautica&quot;, passim). The main mythical characters from Colchis are:

* Absyrtus, son of Aeëtes
* Aeëtes, King of Colchis, son of the sun-god Helios and the Oceanid Perseis (a daughter of Oceanus), brother of Circe and Pasiphae, and father of Medea, Chalciope, and Absyrtus
* Chalciope, daughter of King Aeëtes
* Circe, sister of King Aeëtes
* Idyia, Queen of Colchis, mother of Medea, Chalciope, and Absyrtus
* Medea, daughter of King Aeëtes
* Pasiphaë, sister of Aeëtes

<doc id="81959" wikidata="Q1415908" url="?curid=81959" title="Metacharacter">
<text>A metacharacter is a character that has a special meaning to a computer program, such as a shell interpreter or a regular expression (regex) engine.

In POSIX extended regular expressions, there are 14 metacharacters that must be &quot;escaped&quot; — preceded by a backslash (codice_1) — in order to drop their special meaning and be treated literally inside an expression: opening and closing square brackets (codice_2 and codice_3); backslash (codice_1); caret (codice_5); dollar sign (codice_6); period/full stop/dot (codice_7); vertical bar/pipe symbol (codice_8); question mark (codice_9); asterisk (codice_10); plus and minus signs (codice_11 and codice_12); opening and closing curly brackets/braces (codice_13 and codice_14); and opening and closing parentheses (codice_15 and codice_16).

For example, to match the arithmetic expression codice_17 with a regex, the correct regex is codice_18; otherwise, the parentheses, plus sign, and asterisk will have special meanings.

==Other examples==

Some other characters may have special meaning in some environments.
* In some Unix shells the semicolon (&quot;;&quot;) is a statement separator.
* In XML and HTML, the ampersand (&quot;&amp;&quot;) introduces an HTML entity. It also has special meaning in MS-DOS/Windows Command Prompt.
* In some Unix shells and MS-DOS/Windows Command Prompt, the less-than sign and greater-than sign (&quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot;) are used for redirection and the backtick/grave accent (&quot;`&quot;) is used for command substitution.
* In many programming languages, strings are delimited using quotes (&quot; or &#x27;). In some cases, escape characters (and other methods) are used to avoid delimiter collision, e.g. &quot;He said, \&quot;Hello\&quot;&quot;.
* In printf format strings, the percent sign (&quot;%&quot;) is used to introduce format specifiers and must be escaped as &quot;%%&quot; to be interpreted literally. In SQL, the percent is used as a wildcard character.
* In SQL, the underscore (&quot;_&quot;) is used to match any single character.

==Escaping==

The term &quot;to escape a metacharacter&quot; means to make the metacharacter ineffective (to strip it of its special meaning), causing it to have its literal meaning. For example, in PCRE, a dot (&quot;.&quot;) stands for any single character. The regular expression &quot;A.C&quot; will match &quot;ABC&quot;, &quot;A3C&quot;, or even &quot;A C&quot;. However, if the &quot;.&quot; is escaped, it will lose its meaning as a metacharacter and will be interpreted literally as &quot;.&quot;, causing the regular expression &quot;A\.C&quot; to only match the string &quot;A.C&quot;.

The usual way to escape a character in a regex and elsewhere is by prefixing it with a backslash (&quot;\&quot;). Other environments may employ different methods, like MS-DOS/Windows Command Prompt, where a caret (&quot;^&quot;) is used instead.

<doc id="81963" wikidata="Q1061824" url="?curid=81963" title="Chazuke">
<text>Chazuke (, ちゃづけ) or ochazuke (, from (o)&quot;cha&quot; &#x27;tea&#x27; + &quot;tsuke&quot; &#x27;submerge&#x27;) is a simple Japanese dish made by pouring green tea, dashi, or hot water over cooked rice. Common toppings include &quot;tsukemono&quot; (pickled vegetables), &quot;umeboshi&quot; (pickled ume), nori (seaweed), &quot;furikake&quot;, sesame seeds and &quot;tarako&quot; (salted and marinated pollock roe), salted salmon, &quot;shiokara&quot; (pickled seafood), scallions, and wasabi.

&quot;Chazuke&quot; provides a way to use leftover rice as a quick snack because it is easy to make. In Kyoto, &quot;ochazuke&quot; is known as &quot;bubuzuke.&quot; Since the 1970s, packaged &quot;instant ochazuke&quot;, consisting of freeze-dried toppings and seasonings, has become popular.

== History ==

This dish first became popular in the Heian period of Japan, when water was most commonly poured over rice, but beginning in the Edo period, tea was often used instead.

It is said that the direct ancestor of today&#x27;s chazuke is a method of eating that was adopted by servants (apprentices) who were employed by merchants at that time so that they could finish their meal very quickly during their work. At that time, the servants spent most of their day working, and their meal times were controlled by their superiors, so this form of eating naturally arose. Pickles were almost the only side dish that the apprentices were allowed to eat freely in the simple meals, and they were often piled up in huge bowls. It is speculated that this was also closely related to the establishment of the food form of chazuke. Since there was still no technology to keep cooked rice warm as it is today, chazuke was a convenient way to enjoy cold rice and to finish a meal quickly. It was very useful and popular.
The beginning of chazuke is said to be after the middle of the Edo period, when bancha and green tea became popular and tea became established as a luxury item of the common people. The umami flavor from glutamate in sencha combined with the unique aroma of sencha tea, can be more delicious than white rice sprinkled with hot water. However, among the common people, it was common to put bancha on.

In addition, from the Genroku period, &quot;chazukeya&quot; appeared as a restaurant serving chazuke, and it was widely popular as fast food for the common people. In the Edo Famous Places Picture Society, published in the late Edo period, &quot;SignboardChazuke can be seen as &quot;Edo Masu&quot; and &quot;Edo Masu, which is also served by customers&quot;, and in Edo, &quot;88&quot; with 64 sentences is written on the sign of the chazuke shop, and it can be seen that it was prosperous as it was commonly called 88 chazuke. However, the chazuke restaurant was positioned as a place to have a simple meal, and not only chazuke was served. Among the photographs of the early opening of Japan (late Edo period) on permanent display at the Yokohama Museum of Art, Mishima-juku records the crowding of chazuke shops on the highway. The clerks, customers, and passers-by of the tea shop in this photo are all looking at the camera with surprised faces. This was during the Ansei years before the Meiji Restoration, shortly after the opening of the country, and it must have been very rare for foreign photographers with large photographic machines. However, from the impression that it stopped at this time, you can also see the appearance of the chazuke shop at that time, such as the way customers sit at the eaves of the chazuke shop and glance at us, the landlady stopping with a tray, and various notations such as &quot;chazukeya&quot; and &quot;chazuke&quot; depending on the shop.

== Instant Chazuke ==
Nagatanien proposed the concept of &quot;brewed tea rice&quot; in 1952 and launched &quot;Chazuo Seaweed&quot;. This product is a small package containing matcha.

<text>The Château d&#x27;Amboise is a château in Amboise, located in the Indre-et-Loire &quot;département&quot; of the Loire Valley in France. Confiscated by the monarchy in the 15th century, it became a favoured royal residence and was extensively rebuilt. King Charles VIII died at the château in 1498 after hitting his head on a door lintel. The château fell into decline from the second half of the 16th century and the majority of the interior buildings were later demolished, but some survived and have been restored, along with the outer defensive circuit of towers and walls. It has been recognised as a &quot;monument historique&quot; by the French Ministry of Culture since 1840.

==History==
===Origins===

The Château d&#x27;Amboise was built on a spur above the river Loire. The strategic qualities of the site were recognised before the medieval construction of the castle, and a Gallic oppidum was built there. In the late 9th century Ingelger was made viscount of Orléans and through his mother was related to Hugh the Abbot, tutors to the French kings. Ingelgarius married Adelais of Amboise, a member of a prominent family (a bishop and archbishop were her uncles) who controlled Château d&#x27;Amboise. He was later made Count of Anjou and his rise can be attributed to his political connections and reputation as a soldier. The Château d&#x27;Amboise would pass through Ingelger and Adelais&#x27; heirs, and he was succeeded by their son, Fulk the Red. As Fulk the Red expanded his territory, Amboise, Loches, and Villentrois formed the core of his possessions. Amboise lay on the eastern frontier of the Angevins holdings.

Amboise and its castle descended through the family to Fulke Nerra in 987. Fulk had to contend with the ambitions of Odo I, Count of Blois who wanted to expand his own territory into Anjou. Odo I could call on the support of many followers and instructed Conan, Count of Rennes, Gelduin of Saumur, and Abbot Robert of Saint-Florent de Saumur to harass Fulk&#x27;s properties. While Conan was busy on Anjou&#x27;s western border, Gelduin and Robert attempted to isolate the easternmost castles of Amboise and Loches by raiding the Saumurois and disrupting communications. To further threaten Amboise, fortifications were erected at Chaumont and Montsoreau, while Saint-Aignan was garrisoned.

There is a 12th-century &quot;Book of the Construction of the Castle of Amboise and the Deeds of Its Lords&quot;.

===Royal residence===

Expanded and improved over time, on 4 September 1434 it was seized by Charles VII of France, after its owner, Louis d&#x27;Amboise, Viscount of Thours (1392–1469), was convicted of plotting against Louis XI and condemned to be executed in 1431. However, the King pardoned him but took his château at Amboise. Once in royal hands, the château became a favourite of French kings, from Louis XI to Francis I. Charles VIII decided to rebuild it extensively, beginning in 1492 at first in the French late Gothic Flamboyant style and then after 1495 employing two Italian mason-builders, Domenico da Cortona and Fra Giocondo, who provided at Amboise some of the first Renaissance decorative motifs seen in French architecture. The names of three French builders are preserved in the documents: Colin Biart, Guillaume Senault and Louis Armangeart.

Following the Italian War of 1494–1495, Charles brought Italian architects and artisans to France to work on the château, and turn it into &quot;the first Italianate palace in France&quot;. Among the people Charles brought from Italy was Pacello da Mercogliano who designed the gardens at the Châteaux of Ambois and Blois; his work was highly influential amongst French landscape designers. Charles died at Château d&#x27;Amboise in 1498 after he hit his head on a door lintel. Before his death he had the upper terrace widened to hold a larger parterre and enclosed with latticework and pavilions; his successor, Louis XII, built a gallery round the terrace which can be seen in the 1576 engraving by Jacques Androuet du Cerceau, in &quot;Les plus excellens bastimens de France&quot;. The parterres have been recreated in the twentieth century as rectangles of lawns set in gravel and a formal bosquet of trees.
King Francis I was raised at Amboise, which belonged to his mother, Louise of Savoy, and during the first few years of his reign, the château reached the pinnacle of its glory. As a guest of the King, Leonardo da Vinci came to Château d&#x27;Amboise in December 1515 and lived and worked in the nearby Clos Lucé, connected to the château by an underground passage. Records show that at the time of Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s death on 2 May 1519, he was buried in the Chapel of St Florentin, originally located (before it was razed at the end of 18th century) approximately northeast of the Chapel of St Hubert. This Chapel of St Florentin belonged to the royal castle and lay within the stone fortifications surrounding the property of the Château d&#x27;Amboise, and it should not be confused with the nearby Église Saint Florentin, also in Amboise, but not located within the property boundaries of the Château d&#x27;Amboise.

After the French Revolution (1789–1799), the Chapel of St Florentin was in such a ruinous state that the engineer appointed by Napoleon decided that it was not worth preserving and had it demolished. The remaining stonework was used to repair the Château d&#x27;Amboise. Some 60 years later (and 330 years after Leonardo&#x27;s death and original burial), the foundational site of the Chapel of St Florentin was excavated: it is alleged that a complete skeleton was found, with fragments of a stone inscription containing some of the letters of his name. However, other accounts describe heaps of bones (as is customary in chapels throughout France) and even anecdotes of children kicking skulls around for fun and games. Nonetheless, based on some contemporaneous accounts, it is the collection of bones that were found to be whole and with an extraordinarily large skull that are supposed to be buried in the Chapel of Saint Hubert, where now a large floor-level marble stone bearing a metal medallion relief portrait of Leonardo da Vinci (based on the &quot;Melzi&#x27;s portrait&quot;) and the words LEONARDO DA VINCI seem indicative of his final resting place.

Henry II and his wife, Catherine de&#x27; Medici, raised their children in the Château d&#x27;Amboise, along with Mary Stuart, the child Queen of Scotland who had been promised in marriage to the future French Francis II.

===Amboise conspiracy===

In 1560, during the French Wars of Religion, a conspiracy by members of the Huguenot House of Bourbon against the House of Guise that virtually ruled France in the name of the young Francis II was uncovered by Francis, Duke of Guise and stifled by a series of hangings, which took a month to carry out. By the time it was finished, 1,200 Protestants were gibbetted, strung from the town walls, hung from the iron hooks that held pennants and tapestries on festive occasions and from the very balcony of the &quot;Logis du Roy&quot;. The Court soon had to leave the town because of the smell of corpses.

The abortive peace of Amboise was signed at Amboise on 12 March 1563, between Louis I, Prince of Condé, who had been implicated in the conspiracy to abduct the king, and Catherine de&#x27; Medici. The &quot;edict of pacification&quot;, as it was termed, authorised Protestant services only in chapels of &quot;seigneurs&quot; and justices, with the stipulation that such services be held outside the walls of towns. Neither side was satisfied by this compromise, nor was it widely honoured.

===Decline ===
Amboise never returned to royal favour. At the beginning of the 17th century, the huge château was all but abandoned when the property passed into the hands of Gaston, Duke of Orléans, the brother of the Bourbon King Louis XIII. After his death it returned to the Crown and was turned into a prison during the Fronde, and under Louis XIV it held disgraced minister Nicolas Fouquet and the duc de Lauzun. Louis XV made a gift of it to his minister Étienne François de Choiseul, Duke of Choiseul, who had recently purchased the Château de Chanteloup to the west. The Duke of Penthièvre, a minor royal, bought it after Choiseul&#x27;s death. At his own death in 1793, the castle was confiscated by the State. Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte gifted Amboise to Roger Ducos who, after an engineering assessment, decided to destroy a large part of the castle in order to reduce its costs. Ducos was himself exiled in 1816 and Amboise recovered by the Duchess of Orléans, Penthièvre&#x27;s daughter and mother of future King Louis Philippe I. 

Since 1840, the Château d&#x27;Amboise has been listed as a &quot;monument historique&quot; by the French Ministry of Culture. King Louis-Philippe began restoring it during his reign but with his abdication in 1848, the château was confiscated by the government. The captive Emir Abd Al-Qadir, who resisted the French colonisation of Algeria, and an entourage of family and retainers were transferred to Château d&#x27;Amboise in November 1848. In 1852 an article in &quot;Bentley&#x27;s Miscellany&quot; noted that before Abd Al-Qadir took up residence in the château, it had frequently been visited by tourists.
Later that year, in October, President Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte visited Abd al-Qadir at Amboise to give him the news of his release. In 1873, Louis-Philippe&#x27;s heirs were given control of the property and a major effort to repair it was made, directed by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc. During the German invasion in 1940 the château was damaged further. Today, the present Count of Paris, a descendant of Louis-Philippe, repairs and maintains the château through the Fondation Saint-Louis.

<text>In computer science, a preprocessor (or precompiler) is a program that processes its input data to produce output that is used as input in another program. The output is said to be a preprocessed form of the input data, which is often used by some subsequent programs like compilers. The amount and kind of processing done depends on the nature of the preprocessor; some preprocessors are only capable of performing relatively simple textual substitutions and macro expansions, while others have the power of full-fledged programming languages.

A common example from computer programming is the processing performed on source code before the next step of compilation.
In some computer languages (e.g., C and PL/I) there is a phase of translation known as &quot;preprocessing&quot;. It can also include macro processing, file inclusion and language extensions.

==Lexical preprocessors==
Lexical preprocessors are the lowest-level of preprocessors as they only require lexical analysis, that is, they operate on the source text, prior to any parsing, by performing simple substitution of tokenized character sequences for other tokenized character sequences, according to user-defined rules. They typically perform macro substitution, textual inclusion of other files, and conditional compilation or inclusion.

===C preprocessor===

The most common example of this is the C preprocessor, which takes lines beginning with &#x27;#&#x27; as directives.
The C preprocessor does not expect its input to use the syntax of the C language.
Some languages take a different approach and use built-in language features to achieve similar things. For example:
* Instead of macros, some languages use aggressive inlining and templates.
* Instead of includes, some languages use compile-time imports that rely on type information in the object code.
* Some languages use codice_1 and dead code elimination to achieve conditional compilation.

===Other lexical preprocessors===
Other lexical preprocessors include the general-purpose m4, most commonly used in cross-platform build systems such as autoconf, and GEMA, an open source macro processor which operates on patterns of context.

==Syntactic preprocessors==
Syntactic preprocessors were introduced with the Lisp family of languages. Their role is to transform syntax trees according to a number of user-defined rules. For some programming languages, the rules are written in the same language as the program (compile-time reflection). This is the case with Lisp and OCaml. Some other languages rely on a fully external language to define the transformations, such as the XSLT preprocessor for XML, or its statically typed counterpart CDuce.

Syntactic preprocessors are typically used to customize the syntax of a language, extend a language by adding new primitives, or embed a domain-specific programming language (DSL) inside a general purpose language.

===Customizing syntax===
A good example of syntax customization is the existence of two different syntaxes in the Objective Caml programming language. Programs may be written indifferently using the &quot;normal syntax&quot; or the &quot;revised syntax&quot;, and may be pretty-printed with either syntax on demand.

Similarly, a number of programs written in OCaml customize the syntax of the language by the addition of new operators.

===Extending a language===
The best examples of language extension through macros are found in the Lisp family of languages. While the languages, by themselves, are simple dynamically typed functional cores, the standard distributions of Scheme or Common Lisp permit imperative or object-oriented programming, as well as static typing. Almost all of these features are implemented by syntactic preprocessing, although it bears noting that the &quot;macro expansion&quot; phase of compilation is handled by the compiler in Lisp. This can still be considered a form of preprocessing, since it takes place before other phases of compilation.

===Specializing a language===
One of the unusual features of the Lisp family of languages is the possibility of using macros to create an internal DSL. Typically, in a large Lisp-based project, a module may be written in a variety of such minilanguages, one perhaps using a SQL-based dialect of Lisp, another written in a dialect specialized for GUIs or pretty-printing, etc. Common Lisp&#x27;s standard library contains an example of this level of syntactic abstraction in the form of the LOOP macro, which implements an Algol-like minilanguage to describe complex iteration, while still enabling the use of standard Lisp operators.

The MetaOCaml preprocessor/language provides similar features for external DSLs. This preprocessor takes the description of the semantics of a language (i.e. an interpreter) and, by combining compile-time interpretation and code generation, turns that definition into a compiler to the OCaml programming language—and from that language, either to bytecode or to native code.
==General purpose preprocessor==

Most preprocessors are specific to a particular data processing task (e.g., compiling the C language). A preprocessor may be promoted as being &quot;general purpose&quot;, meaning that it is not aimed at a specific usage or programming language, and is intended to be used for a wide variety of text processing tasks.
M4 is probably the most well known example of such a general purpose preprocessor, although the C preprocessor is sometimes used in a non-C specific role. Examples:
* using C preprocessor for JavaScript preprocessing.
* using C preprocessor for devicetree processing within the Linux kernel.
* using M4 or C preprocessor as a template engine, to HTML generation.
* imake, a make interface using the C preprocessor, written for the X Window System but now deprecated in favour of automake.
* grompp, a preprocessor for simulation input files for GROMACS (a fast, free, open-source code for some problems in computational chemistry) which calls the system C preprocessor (or other preprocessor as determined by the simulation input file) to parse the topology, using mostly the #define and #include mechanisms to determine the effective topology at grompp run time.

<text>In Greek mythology, several characters were known as Cycnus (Ancient Greek: Κύκνος) or Cygnus. The literal meaning of the name is &quot;swan&quot;, and accordingly most of them ended up being transformed into swans.

* Cycnus, son of Ares.
*Cycnus, king of Kolonai. Son of Poseidon.
*Cycnus, lover of Phaethon.
*Cycnus, son of Apollo.
*Cycnus, son of King Ederion (Ancient Greek: Ἐδερίων) or Eredion of Achaea, who, in the 6th century CE account of John Malalas, seduced Leda and made her mother of triplets: the Dioscuri and Helen. In all other sources, she had these children by Zeus who approached her in the shape of a swan (&quot;kyknos&quot;). For more information, see Leda and the Swan.
*Cycnus, one of the Suitors of Penelope who came from Dulichium along with other 56 wooers. He, with the other suitors, was shot dead by Odysseus with the assistance of Eumaeus, Philoetius, and Telemachus.
*&quot;Cycnus&quot;, a blunder for &quot;Guneus&quot; in the manuscript of Hyginus (list of the Achaean leaders against Troy).

According to Pseudo-Eratosthenes and Hyginus&#x27; &quot;Poetical Astronomy&quot;, the constellation Cygnus was the stellar image of the swan Zeus had transformed into in order to seduce Leda or Nemesis. Pausanias and Servius state that Apollo turned Cycnus of Liguria into a swan after the death of his lover Phaeton, then later placed him among the stars as the constellation Cygnus.

<text>In Greek mythology, Tenes or Tennes (Ancient Greek: Τέννης) was the eponymous hero of the island of Tenedos.

== Family ==
Tenes was the son either of Apollo or of King Cycnus of Colonae by Proclia, daughter or granddaughter of Laomedon.

== Mythology ==
Cycnus&#x27;s second wife Philonome, daughter of Tragasus or Cragasus, falsely accused Tenes of rape, bringing in a flutist named Eumolpus as witness. Cycnus believed the accusations and tried to kill Tenes and his sister Hemithea by placing them both in a chest, which was set into the ocean. However, the chest landed at the island of Leucophrye, which was later renamed Tenedos, and the two survived. The natives of the island pronounced Tenes their king. Cycnus later learned the truth, killed Eumolpus, buried Philonome alive and tried to reconcile with his children, but Tenes rejected his overture: when Cycnus&#x27;s ship landed at Tenedos, Tenes took an axe and cut the moorings.

Tenes fought with Achilles when Achilles had tried to assault his sister. Though his sister escaped, Tenes died when Achilles plunged a sword into his heart. Even though Thetis had previously warned her son against doing so, for Tenes&#x27;s death would be avenged by Apollo, Achilles was heedless and sealed his death by Apollo&#x27;s hands. Shortly after the end of the Trojan War, Agamemnon permitted the Trojan prisoners of war to build a city north of Mycenae. The city was called Tenea after Tenes. A description on the history of Tenea was also given by Pausanias.

Diodorus Siculus relates that the Tenedians founded a sanctuary of Tenes to commemorate his virtues. No flute player was allowed to enter the sacred precinct, and the name of Achilles was not to be uttered in it. Sacrifices were offered to Tenes until recent times.

Greeks used the proverb &quot;Tenedian human&quot; () in reference to those with frightening appearance, because when Tenes laid down laws in Tenedos he stipulated that a man with an axe should stand behind the judge and strike the man being convicted after he had spoken in vain.

<text>Franz Clemens Honoratus Hermann Josef Brentano (; ; 16 January 1838 – 17 March 1917) was a German philosopher and psychologist. His 1874 &quot;Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint&quot;, considered his magnum opus, is credited with having reintroduced the medieval scholastic concept of intentionality into contemporary philosophy.

Originally a Catholic priest, Brentano withdrew from the priesthood in 1873 due to the dogmatic definition of papal infallibility in &quot;Pastor aeternus&quot;. Working subsequently as a non-denominational professor, his teaching triggered research in a wide array of fields such as linguistics, logic, mathematics and experimental psychology through the young generation of philosophers who were gathered as the School of Brentano.

==Life==
Brentano was born at , near Boppard. He was son of Christian Brentano, brother of Lujo Brentano, and paternal nephew of Clemens Brentano and Bettina von Arnim, and of Gunda (née Brentano) and Friedrich von Savigny. His paternal grandfather was of Italian descent, and some of his ancestors are Sophie von La Roche and Johann Philipp Stadion, Count von Warthausen.

He studied philosophy at the universities of Munich, Würzburg, Berlin (with Adolf Trendelenburg) and Münster. He had a special interest in Aristotle and scholastic philosophy. He wrote his dissertation in 1862 at Tübingen under the title &quot;Von der mannigfachen Bedeutung des Seienden nach Aristoteles&quot; (&quot;On the Several Senses of Being in Aristotle&quot;). His thesis advisor was Franz Jakob Clemens. Subsequently, he began to study theology and entered the seminary in Munich and then Würzburg. He was ordained a Catholic priest on 6 August 1864.

In 1866 he defended his habilitation thesis, &quot;Die Psychologie des Aristoteles, insbesondere seine Lehre vom Nous Poietikos&quot; (&quot;The Psychology of Aristotle, in Particular His Doctrine of the Active Intellect&quot;, published 1867), and began to lecture at the University of Würzburg. His students in this period included, among others, Carl Stumpf and Anton Marty. Between 1870 and 1873, Brentano was heavily involved in the debate on papal infallibility in matters of Faith. A strong opponent of such dogma, he eventually gave up his priesthood and his tenure in 1873. He remained, however, deeply religious and dealt with the topic of the existence of God in lectures given at the Universities of Würzburg and Vienna.

In 1874 Brentano published his major work, &quot;Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint&quot;. From 1874 to 1895 he taught at the University of Vienna, Austria-Hungary. Among his students were Edmund Husserl, Sigmund Freud, Tomáš Masaryk, Rudolf Steiner, Alexius Meinong, Carl Stumpf, Anton Marty, Kazimierz Twardowski, and Christian von Ehrenfels and many others (see School of Brentano for more details). While he began his career as a full ordinary professor, he was forced to give up both his Austrian citizenship and his professorship in 1880 in order to marry Ida Lieben (Austro-Hungarian law denied matrimony to persons who had been ordained priests even if they later had resigned from priesthood), but he was permitted to stay at the university only as a &quot;Privatdozent&quot;. After the departure of Twardowski back to Lwów and the death of his wife in 1894, Brentano retired and moved to Florence in 1896, where he married his second wife, Emilie Ruprecht, in 1897. He transferred to Zürich at the outbreak of the First World War, where he died in 1917.

==Work==

===Intentionality===

Brentano is best known for his reintroduction of the concept of intentionality—a concept derived from scholastic philosophy—to contemporary philosophy in his lectures and in his work &quot;Psychologie vom empirischen Standpunkt&quot; (&quot;Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint&quot;). While often simplistically summarised as &quot;aboutness&quot; or the relationship between mental acts and the external world, Brentano defined it as the main characteristic of &quot;mental phenomena&quot;, by which they could be distinguished from &quot;physical phenomena&quot;. Every mental phenomenon, every psychological act has content, is directed at an object (the &quot;intentional object&quot;). Every belief, desire etc. has an object that they are about: the believed, the desired. Brentano used the expression &quot;intentional inexistence&quot; to indicate the status of the objects of thought in the mind. The property of being intentional, of having an intentional object, was the key feature to distinguish psychological phenomena and physical phenomena, because, as Brentano defined it, physical phenomena lacked the ability to generate &quot;original intentionality&quot;, and could only facilitate an intentional relationship in a second-hand manner, which he labeled &quot;derived intentionality&quot;.


Brentano introduced a distinction between genetic psychology (&quot;genetische Psychologie&quot;) and descriptive psychology (&quot;beschreibende&quot; or &quot;deskriptive Psychologie&quot;): in his terminology, genetic psychology is the study of psychological phenomena from a third-person point of view, which involves the use of empirical experiments (satisfying, thus, the scientific standards we nowadays expect of an empirical science). (This concept is roughly equivalent to what is now called empirical psychology, cognitive science, or &quot;heterophenomenology&quot;, an explicitly third-person, scientific approach to the study of consciousness.) The aim of descriptive psychology, on the other hand, is to describe consciousness from a first-person point of view. The latter approach was further developed by Husserl and the phenomenological tradition.

===Theory of perception===
He is also well known for claiming that &quot;Wahrnehmung ist Falschnehmung&quot; (&#x27;perception is misconception&#x27;) that is to say perception is erroneous. In fact he maintained that external, sensory perception could not tell us anything about the &quot;de facto&quot; existence of the perceived world, which could simply be illusion. However, we can be absolutely sure of our internal perception. When I hear a tone, I cannot be completely sure that there is a tone in the real world, but I am absolutely certain that I do hear. This awareness, of the fact that I hear, is called internal perception. External perception, sensory perception, can only yield hypotheses about the perceived world, but not truth. Hence he and many of his pupils (in particular Carl Stumpf and Edmund Husserl) thought that the natural sciences could only yield hypotheses and never universal, absolute truths as in pure logic or mathematics.

However, in a reprinting of his &quot;Psychologie vom Empirischen Standpunkte&quot; (&quot;Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint&quot;), he recanted this previous view. He attempted to do so without reworking the previous arguments within that work but it has been said that he was wholly unsuccessful. The new view states that when we hear a sound, we hear something from the external world; there are no physical phenomena of internal perception.

===Theory of judgment===

Brentano has a theory of judgment which is different from what is currently the predominant (Fregean) view. At the centre of Brentano&#x27;s theory of judgment lies the idea that a judgment depends on having a presentation, but this presentation does not have to be predicated. Even stronger: Brentano thought that predication is not even necessary for judgment, because there are judgments without a predicational content. Another fundamental aspect of his theory is that judgments are always existential. This so-called existential claim implies that when someone is judging that S is P he/she is judging that some S that is P exists. (Note that Brentano denied the idea that all judgments are of the form: S is P [and all other kinds of judgment which combine presentations]. Brentano argued that there are also judgments arising from a single presentation, e.g. “the planet Mars exists” has only one presentation.) In Brentano&#x27;s own symbols, a judgment is always of the form: ‘+A’ (A exists) or ‘–A’ (A does not exist).

Combined with the third fundamental claim of Brentano, the idea that all judgments are either positive (judging that A exists) or negative (judging that A does not exist), we have a complete picture of Brentano&#x27;s theory of judgment. So, imagine that you doubt whether midgets exist. At that point you have a presentation of midgets in your mind. When you judge that midgets do not exist, then you are judging that the presentation you have does not present something that exists. You do not have to utter that in words or otherwise predicate that judgment. The whole judgment takes place in the denial (or approval) of the existence of the presentation you have.

The problem of Brentano&#x27;s theory of judgment is not the idea that all judgments are existential judgments (though it is sometimes a very complex enterprise to transform an ordinary judgment into an existential one), the real problem is that Brentano made no distinction between object and presentation. A presentation exists as an object in your mind. So you cannot really judge that A does not exist, because if you do so you also judge that the presentation is not there (which is impossible, according to Brentano&#x27;s idea that all judgments have the object which is judged as presentation). Kazimierz Twardowski acknowledged this problem and solved it by denying that the object is equal to the presentation. This is actually only a change within Brentano&#x27;s theory of perception, but has a welcome consequence for the theory of judgment, viz. that you can have a presentation (which exists) but at the same time judge that the object does not exist.

==Legacy==
The young Martin Heidegger was very much inspired by Brentano&#x27;s early work &quot;On the Several Senses of Being in Aristotle&quot;.
Brentano&#x27;s focus on conscious (or phenomenal) intentionality was inherited by Carl Stumpf&#x27;s Berlin School of experimental psychology, Anton Marty&#x27;s Prague School of linguistics, Alexius Meinong&#x27;s Graz School of experimental psychology, Kazimierz Twardowski&#x27;s Lwów School of philosophy, and Edmund Husserl&#x27;s phenomenology. Brentano&#x27;s work also influenced George Stout, the teacher of G. E. Moore and Bertrand Russell at Cambridge University.

<text>In Greek mythology, Oileus or Oïleus (; &quot;Oī̈leús&quot;) was the king of Locris, and an Argonaut.

== Family ==
Oileus&#x27;s father was given as Hodoedocus (whom Oileus succeeded as King of Locris) and his mother as Agrianome (daughter of Perseon), according to Hyginus&#x27;s &quot;Fabulae&quot;. Oileus is best known as the father of Ajax the Lesser. There is disagreement as to the name of Ajax&#x27;s mother: Homer names Eriopis as the legal wife of Oileus, but scholiasts cite other authors, some of whom agreed with Homer in considering Eriopis (or Eriope) the mother of Ajax, but others stated that the mother of Ajax by Oileus was Alcimache, and yet others asserted that Alcimache was simply another name for Eriopis. John Tzetzes listed three alternate options: Eriopis, Alcimache, or Astyoche the daughter of Itylus. Oileus was also the father of Medon, who is usually regarded as illegitimate; Medon&#x27;s mother was said to be a nymph named Rhene, though some gave Alcimache as his mother. According to Hyginus, Rhene was the mother of Ajax as well.

== Mythology ==
In Apollonius Rhodius&#x27; &quot;Argonautica&quot;, Oileus gets wounded in the shoulder during the attack of the Stymphalian Birds on the &quot;Argo&quot; and receives aid from Eribotes.

Oileus was also the name of a defender of Troy, the charioteer of Bienor, killed by Agamemnon.

<text>In Greek mythology and history, Medon (; , &quot;gen&quot;.: Μέδοντος means &quot;lord&#x27; or &quot;ruler&quot;) is the name of a number of different figures:
* Medon, one of the Tyrrhenian pirates who attempted to enslave Dionysus and were changed into fish or dolphin.
*Medon, a centaur at the wedding of Pirithous and Hippodamia.
*Medon, one of the Dolionians, who was killed by the Argonauts.
*Medon, son of Eteoclus and accordingly a participant in the war of the Epigoni.
*Medon, the son of Pylades and Electra and brother of Strophius.
*Medon, one of the Achaean Leaders and half-brother of Ajax the Lesser. He was the son of Oileus, king of Locris, by Rhene or Alcimache. He lived in Phylace, to where he had to flee after he had killed a relative of his stepmother Eriopis. In the Trojan War, Medon took over Philoctetes&#x27; army after the latter was bitten by a snake and left on Lemnos because the wound festered and smelled bad. Medon was killed by Aeneas.
*Medon, a &quot;cunning craftsman&quot; of Cilla, husband of Iphianassa and father of Metalcas and Zechis, of whom the former was slain in the Trojan War by Neoptolemus, and the latter by Teucer.
*Medon, son of Antenor and Theano, thus brother of Crino, Acamas, Agenor, Antheus, Archelochus, Coön, Demoleon, Eurymachus, Glaucus, Helicaon, Iphidamas, Laodamas, Laodocus, Polybus and Thersilochus. Medon was killed by Philoctetes, and later Aeneas met him in the Underworld.
*Medon, the faithful herald of Odysseus in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;. Following the advice of his son Telemachus, Odysseus spares Medon&#x27;s life after killing the suitors of Penelope who had been plaguing his halls in his homeland of Ithaca. Medon attempts to return the favor by speaking on behalf of his master, claiming that Odysseus&#x27; violence was not unwarranted by the gods.

<text>Sputnik 2 (, , &quot;Satellite 2&quot;, or Prosteyshiy Sputnik 2 (PS-2, , &quot;Simplest Satellite 2&quot;, launched on 3 November 1957, was the second spacecraft launched into Earth orbit, and the first to carry an animal into orbit, a Soviet space dog named Laika.

Launched by the Soviet Union via a modified R-7 intercontinental ballistic missile, Sputnik 2 was a cone-shaped capsule with a base diameter of that weighed around , though it was not designed to separate from the rocket core that brought it to orbit, bringing the total mass in orbit to . It contained several compartments for radio transmitters, a telemetry system, a programming unit, a regeneration and temperature-control system for the cabin, and scientific instruments. A separate sealed cabin contained the dog Laika.

Though Laika died shortly after reaching orbit, Sputnik 2 marked another huge success for the Soviet Union in The Space Race, lofting a (for the time) huge payload, sending an animal into orbit, and, for the first time, returning scientific data from above the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere for an extended period. The satellite reentered Earth&#x27;s atmosphere on 14 April 1958.

==Background==
In 1955, engineer Mikhail Tikhonravov created a proposal for &quot;Object D&quot;, a satellite massing to , about a fourth of which would be devoted to scientific instruments. Upon learning that this spacecraft would outmass the announced American satellite by nearly 1,000 times, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev advocated for the proposal, which was approved by the government in Resolution #149-88 of 30 January 1956. Work began on the project in February with a launch date of latter 1957, in time for the International Geophysical Year. The design was finalized on 24 July.

By the end of 1956, it had become clear that neither the complicated Object D nor the 8A91 satellite launch vehicle version of the R-7 ICBM under development to launch it would be finished in time for a 1957 launch. Thus, in December 1956, OKB-1 head Sergei Korolev proposed the development of two simpler satellites: PS, Prosteishy Sputnik, or Primitive Satellite. The two PS satellites would be simple spheres massing and equipped solely with a radio antenna. The project was approved by the government on 25 January 1957. The choice to launch these two instead of waiting for the more advanced Object D (which would eventually become Sputnik 3) to be finished was largely motivated by the desire to launch a satellite to orbit before the US. The first of these satellites, Sputnik 1 (PS-1), was successfully launched 4 October 1957, and became the world&#x27;s first artificial satellite.

Immediately following the launch, Nikita Khrushchev asked Sergei Korolev to prepare a Sputnik 2 in time for the 40th anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution in early November, just three weeks later. Details of the conversation vary, but it appears likely that Korolev suggested the idea of flying a dog, while Khrushchev emphasised the importance of the date.

With only three weeks to prepare, OKB-1 had to scramble to assemble a new satellite. While PS-2 had been built, it was just a ball, identical to PS-1. Fortunately, the R-5A sounding rocket had recently been used to launch a series of suborbital missions carrying dogs as payloads. Korolev simply requisitioned a payload container used for these missions and had it installed in the upper stage of its R-7 launching rocket directly beneath the PS-2 sphere. Upon reaching orbit, the final stage or Blok A would detach from the satellite. No provision was made for the dog&#x27;s recovery.

==Spacecraft==

Sputnik 2 was a cone-shaped capsule with a base diameter of that weighed around , though it was not designed to separate from the rocket core that brought it to orbit, bringing the total mass in orbit to .

===Passenger===
&quot;Laika&quot; (&quot;Barker&quot;), formerly &quot;Kudryavka&quot; (Little Curly), was the part-Samoyed terrier chosen to fly in Sputnik 2. Due to a shortness in the time frame, the candidate dog could not be trained for the mission. Again, OKB-1 borrowed from the sounding rocket program, choosing from ten candidates provided by the Air Force Institute of Aviation Medicine that were already trained for suborbital missions. Laika was chosen primarily because of her even temperament. Her backup was Albina, who had flown on two R-1E missions in June 1956. Laika weighed about .

Both Laika and Albina had telemetry wires surgically attached to them before the flight to monitor respiration frequency, pulse, and blood pressure.

The pressurized cabin on Sputnik 2 was padded and allowed enough room for Laika to lie down or stand. An air regeneration system provided oxygen; food and water were dispensed in a gelatinized form. Laika was chained in place and fitted with a harness, a bag to collect waste, and electrodes to monitor vital signs. A television camera was mounted in the passenger compartment to observe Laika. The camera could transmit 100-line video frames at 10 frames/second.

===Experiments===

Sputnik 2 was the first platform capable of making scientific measurements in orbit. This was potentially as significant as the biological payload. The Earth&#x27;s atmosphere blocks the Sun&#x27;s X-ray and ultraviolet output from ground observation. Moreover, solar output is unpredictable and fluctuates rapidly, making sub-orbital sounding rockets inadequate for the observation task. Thus a satellite is required for long-term, continuous study of the complete solar spectrum.

Accordingly, Sputnik 2 carried two spectrophotometers, one for measuring solar ultraviolet rays and one for measuring X-rays. These instruments were provided by Professor Sergei Mandelstam of the Lebedev Institute of Physics and installed in the nose cone above the spherical PS. In addition, Sergei Vernov, who had completed a cosmic ray detector (using Geiger counters) for Object D, demanded that the instrument his Moscow University team (including Naum Grigoriev, Alexander Chudakov, and Yuri Logachev) had built also be carried on the flight. Korolev agreed, but as there was no more room on the satellite proper, the instrument was mounted on the Blok A and given its own battery and telemetry frequency.

Engineering and biological data were transmitted using the Tral_D telemetry system, which would transmit data to Earth for 15 minutes of each orbit.

==Launch preparations==
Sputnik 2&#x27;s launch vehicle, the R-7 ICBM (also known by the system&#x27;s GRAU index 8K71) was modified for the PS-2 satellite launch and designated 8K71PS. 8K71PS serial number M1-2PS arrived at the NIIP-5 Test Range, the precursor to the Baikonur Cosmodrome, on 18 October 1957 for final integration of the rocket stages and satellite payload. Laika was put in the payload container mid-day 31 October, and that night, the payload was attached to the rocket. The container was heated via an external tube against the cold temperatures at the launch site.

==Mission==
Sputnik 2 was launched at 02:30:42 UTC on 3 November 1957 from LC-1 of the NIIP-5 Test Range via Sputnik 8K71PS rocket (the same pad and rocket that launched Sputnik 1) The satellite&#x27;s orbit was with a period of 103.7 minutes. After reaching orbit Sputnik 2&#x27;s nose cone was jettisoned successfully, but the satellite did not separate from the Blok A. This, along with the loss of some thermal insulation, caused temperatures in the spacecraft to soar.

At peak acceleration, Laika&#x27;s respiration increased to between three and four times the pre-launch rate. The sensors showed her heart rate was 103 beats/min before launch and increased to 240 beats/min during the early acceleration. After three hours of weightlessness, Laika&#x27;s pulse rate had settled back to 102 beats/min, three times longer than it had taken during earlier ground tests, an indication of the stress she was under. The early telemetry indicated that Laika was agitated but eating her food. After approximately five to seven hours into the flight, no further signs of life were received from the spacecraft.

The Soviet scientists had planned to euthanise Laika with a serving of poisoned food. For many years, the Soviet Union gave several conflicting statements that she had died either from asphyxia, when the batteries failed, or that she had been euthanised. Many rumours circulated about the exact manner of her death. In 1999, several Russian sources reported that Laika had died when the cabin overheated on the fourth day. In October 2002, Dimitri Malashenkov, one of the scientists behind the Sputnik2 mission, revealed that Laika had died by the fourth circuit of flight from overheating. According to a paper he presented to the World Space Congress in Houston, Texas, &quot;It turned out that it was practically impossible to create a reliable temperature control system in such limited time constraints.&quot;

Because of the size of Sputnik 2 and its attached Blok A, the spacecraft was easy to track optically. In its last orbits, the combined body tumbled end over end, flashing brightly before it was incinerated over the north Atlantic after circling the Earth 2,370 times over the course of 162 days. The spacecraft reentered the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere on 14 April 1958, at approximately 0200 hrs, on a line that stretched from New York to the Amazon. Its track was plotted by British ships and three &quot;Moon Watch Observations&quot;, from New York. It was said to be glowing and did not develop a tail until it was at latitudes south of 20° North. Estimates put the average length of the tail at about .
== Results==

===Geopolitical impact===
Massing , Sputnik 2 marked a dramatic leap in orbital mass over Sputnik 1 as well as the American Vanguard, which had yet to fly. The day after Sputnik 2 went into orbit the Gaither committee met with President Eisenhower to brief him on the current situation, demanding an urgent and more dramatic response than to the smaller Sputnik 1. It was clear now that the Soviets had missiles far superior to any in the American arsenal, a fact whose demonstration by Sputnik 2 was eagerly propounded by Soviet Premier Khrushchev at every opportunity. In the U.S.S.R., just six days after the launch of Sputnik 2, on the 40th anniversary of the October revolution, Khrushchev boasted in a speech “Now our first Sputnik is not lonely in its space travels.” Nevertheless, unlike most of the U.S., President Eisenhower kept calm through the time afterward just as he did after Sputnik 1 was launched. According to one of the president&#x27;s aides, “The president&#x27;s burning concern was to keep the country from going hog-wild and from embarking on foolish, costly schemes.”

The mission sparked a debate across the globe on the mistreatment of animals and animal testing in general to advance science. In the United Kingdom, the National Canine Defence League called on all dog owners to observe a minute&#x27;s silence on each day Laika remained in space, while the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) received protests even before Radio Moscow had finished announcing the launch. Animal rights groups at the time called on members of the public to protest at Soviet embassies. Others demonstrated outside the United Nations in New York. Laboratory researchers in the U.S. offered some support for the Soviets, at least before the news of Laika&#x27;s death.

===Experimental data===
The cosmic ray detector transmitted for one week, going silent on 9 November when its battery was exhausted. The experiment reported unexpected results the day after launch, noting an increase in high-energy charged particles from a normal 18 pulses/sec to 72 pulses/sec at the highest latitudes of its orbit. Per two articles in the Soviet newspaper Pravda, the particle flux increased with altitude as well. It is likely that Sputnik 2 was detecting the lower levels of the Van Allen Belt when it reached the apogee of its orbit. However, because Sputnik 2 telemetry could only be received when it was flying over the Soviet Union, the data set was insufficient to draw conclusions, particularly as, most of the time, Sputnik 2 traveled below the Belt. Additional observational data had been received by Australian observers when the satellite was overhead, and Soviet scientists asked them for it. The secrecy-minded Soviets were not willing to give the Australians the code that would give them the ability to descramble and use the data themselves. As a result, the Australians declined to turn over their data. Thus, the Soviet Union missed out on its chance to get credit for the scientific discovery, which ultimately went to James Van Allen of the State University of Iowa, whose experiments on Explorer 1 and Explorer 3 first mapped the radiation belts that now bear his name.

As for the ultraviolet and X-ray photometers, they were calibrated such that they were oversaturated by orbital radiation, returning no usable data.

==Surviving examples==
A USSR-built engineering model of the R-7 Sputnik 8K71PS (Sputnik II) is located at the Cosmosphere space museum in Hutchinson, Kansas, United States. The museum also has a flight-ready backup of the Sputnik 1, as well as replicas of the first two American satellites, Explorer 1 and Vanguard 1.

A replica of Sputnik 2 is located at the Memorial Museum of Cosmonautics in Moscow.

<doc id="81981" wikidata="Q2364587" url="?curid=81981" title="Vanguard TV-3">
<text>Vanguard TV-3 (also called Vanguard Test Vehicle-Three), was the first attempt of the United States to launch a satellite into orbit around the Earth, after the successful Soviet launches of Sputnik 1 and Sputnik 2. Vanguard TV-3 was a small satellite designed to test the launch capabilities of the three-stage Vanguard and study the effects of the environment on a satellite and its systems in Earth orbit. It was also to be used to obtain geodetic measurements through orbit analysis. Solar cells on Vanguard TV-3 were manufactured by Bell Laboratories.

At its launch attempt on 6 December 1957, at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, the booster ignited and began to rise, but about two seconds after liftoff, after rising about 1.2 m (four feet), the rocket lost thrust and fell back to the launch pad. As it settled, the fuel tanks ruptured and exploded, destroying the rocket and severely damaging the launch pad. The Vanguard 1A satellite was thrown clear and landed on the ground a short distance away with its transmitters still sending out a beacon signal. The satellite was damaged, however, and could not be reused. It is now on display at the National Air and Space Museum of the Smithsonian Institution.

The exact cause of the accident was not determined with certainty, but it appeared that the fuel system malfunctioned. Other engines of the same model were modified and did not fail.

== Satellite construction project ==

The history of the Vanguard TV-3 project dates back to the International Geophysical Year (IGY). This was an enthusiastic international undertaking that united scientists globally to conduct planet-wide geophysical studies. The IGY guaranteed free exchange of information acquired through scientific observation which led to many important discoveries in the future. Orbiting a satellite became one of the main goals of the IGY. As early as July 1955, President Dwight D. Eisenhower announced, through his press secretary, that the United States would launch &quot;small, unmanned, Earth-circling satellites as part of the U.S. participation in the I.G.Y.&quot; On 9 September 1955, the United States Department of Defense (U.S. DoD) wrote a letter to the secretary of the Navy authorizing the mission to proceed. The U.S. Navy had been assigned the task of launching Vanguard satellites as part of the program. Project Vanguard had officially begun.

== Spacecraft ==
The payload of the TV-3 was very similar to the later Vanguard 1. It was a small aluminium sphere, in diameter and with a mass of . It carried two transmitters: a 10-mW, 108-MHz transmitter powered by a mercury battery, and a 5-mW, 108.03-MHz transmitter powered by six solar cells mounted on the body of the spacecraft. Using six small aerial antennae mounted on its body, the satellite primarily transmitted engineering and telemetry data, but the transmitters were also used to determine the total electron content between the satellite and the ground stations. Other instruments in the satellite&#x27;s design included two thermistors, which were used to measure the satellite&#x27;s internal temperatures for the purpose of tracking its thermal protection&#x27;s effectiveness. Although the satellite was damaged beyond reuse capability during the crash, it was still transmitting after the incident.

== Launch vehicle ==
Vanguard TV-3 utilized the three-stage Vanguard designed to send the satellite into orbit around the Earth. The fins were removed from the rocket as a way to reduce the drag and instead, the launch motor was mounted in gimbals which allowed it to pivot and direct its thrust for steering. The second and third stages of the rocket were also gimballed.

== Launch ==
At launch on 6 December 1957 at 16:44:35 GMT at the Atlantic Missile Range in Cape Canaveral, Florida, the booster ignited and began to rise but about 2 seconds after liftoff, after rising about a meter, the rocket lost thrust and began to settle back down to the launch pad. As it settled against the launch pad the fuel tanks ruptured and exploded, destroying the rocket and severely damaging the launch pad. The Vanguard satellite was thrown clear and landed on the ground a short distance away with its transmitters still sending out a beacon signal. The satellite was damaged, however, and could not be reused. It is now on display at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.

== Cause of failure ==
The exact cause of the accident was not determined with certainty due to limited telemetry instrumentation at this early phase, but Martin Marietta concluded that low fuel tank pressure during the start procedure allowed some of the burning fuel in the combustion chamber to leak into the fuel system through the injector head before full propellant pressure was obtained from the turbopump. General Electric, on the other hand, argued that the problem was a loose fuel connection. In hindsight, the first problem appeared to cause the second. The investigation concluded that tank and fuel system pressure were slightly lower than nominal, which resulted in insufficient pressure in the injector head. As a result, hot combustion gas backed up into the injector head and caused a large pressure spike. The injector rings completely burned through, followed by the rupture of the combustion chamber. At T+1 second, a shock wave in the thrust section of the booster ruptured a fuel feed line, completely terminating engine thrust. GE technicians had failed to catch this design flaw during testing and a temporary fix was made by increasing tank pressure. Eventually, a further modification was made by using ethane gas to increase fuel force and prevent rough start transients. The X-405 engine did not fail again on subsequent launches and static firing tests.

== Reaction ==
After the launch failure, trading in the stock of the Martin Company, the prime contractor for the project, was temporarily suspended by the New York Stock Exchange.

Newspapers in the United States published prominent headlines and articles describing the failure with plays on the name of the Russian satellite, Sputnik, such as &quot;Flopnik&quot;, &quot;Kaputnik&quot;, &quot;Oopsnik&quot;, &quot;Dudnick&quot; and &quot;Stayputnik&quot;. The failure, reported in international media, was a humiliating loss of prestige for the United States, which had presented itself to the world as the leader in science and technology. The Soviet Union, the United States&#x27; rival in the Cold War, exploited the disaster. A few days after the incident, a Soviet delegate to the United Nations inquired whether the United States was interested in receiving aid earmarked for &quot;undeveloped countries&quot;.

The TV-3 disaster was quoted by the New York Times as a &quot;Blow to US Prestige&quot;. Senator Lyndon B. Johnson had said that the launch was &quot;most humiliating&quot; for the American people. In the words of Donald J. Markarian, the project engineer of the Martin Company, the company in charge of the development and creation of TV-3, &quot;Following the TV-3 explosion, Project Vanguard became the whipping boy for the hurt pride of the American people.&quot;

The concurrent project Explorer 1 proved successful a few weeks later, on 1 February 1958.

== Trivia ==
In &quot;Kerbal Space Program&quot; there is a probe named &quot;Stayputnik&quot;, likely intended as an homage.

<doc id="81982" wikidata="Q212827" url="?curid=81982" title="Philoctetes">
<text>Philoctetes ( &quot;Philoktētēs&quot;; English pronunciation: , stressed on the third syllable, &quot;-tet-&quot;), or Philocthetes, according to Greek mythology, was the son of Poeas, king of Meliboea in Thessaly, and Demonassa or Methone. He was a Greek hero, famed as an archer, and a participant in the Trojan War.

Philoctetes was the subject of four different plays of ancient Greece, each written by one of the three major Greek tragedians. Of the four plays, Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Philoctetes&quot; is the only one that has survived. Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Philoctetes at Troy&quot;, Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;Philoctetes&quot; and Euripides&#x27; &quot;Philoctetes&quot; have all been lost, with the exception of some fragments. Philoctetes is also mentioned in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, Book 2, which describes his exile on the island of Lemnos, his being wounded by snake-bite, and his eventual recall by the Greeks. The recall of Philoctetes is told in the lost epic &quot;Little Iliad&quot;, where his retrieval was accomplished by Diomedes. Philoctetes killed three men at Troy.

== Description ==
Philoctetes was described by the chronicler Malalas in his account of the &quot;Chronography&quot; as &quot;a good height, well set, dark skinned, eyebrows meeting, brave, good eyes, good nose, black hair, hairy, sensible, accurate archer, magnanimous&quot;.

Philoctetes was the son of Poeas, king of Meliboea in Thessaly. He came into possession of the bow and arrows of Heracles after assisting the hero in ending the agony of the shirt of Nessus—Philoctetes, or in some versions his father, lit the pyre on which Heracles immolated himself and became immortal. Philoctetes then received the favor of the newly deified Heracles.

Philoctetes had been one of the many eligible Greeks who competed for the hand of Helen, the Spartan princess; as such, he was required to participate in the expedition to reclaim her for Menelaus that became the Trojan War. However, on the way to Troy, Philoctetes was left behind and stranded on the island of Lemnos. There are at least four stories about what caused the Greeks to abandon Philoctetes, but in every version he received a wound on his foot that festered and had a terrible smell.
One version holds that Philoctetes was bitten by a snake that Hera sent to molest him as punishment for the service rendered to Heracles, since Hera was portrayed in one tradition as the adversary of Heracles. The snakebite recurs in a version that has the Achaeans, en route to Troy, coming to the island of Tenedos, where Achilles angered Apollo by killing King Tenes, allegedly the god&#x27;s son. When the Achaeans were sacrificing to Apollo in expiation, a snake came out from the altar and bit Philoctetes.

Another tradition says that the Greeks forced Philoctetes to show them where Heracles&#x27;s ashes were deposited. Philoctetes would not break his oath by speech, but he went to the spot and placed his foot upon the site. The foot that touched the soil over the ashes immediately suffered a wound.

In a fourth version, Philoctetes received his terrible wound on the island of Chryse when he unknowingly trespassed the shrine of the nymph after whom the island was named. (This is the version in the extant play by Sophocles.) A modern interpretation is that he was scratched by a poisoned arrow. Commonly tips of arrows were poisoned with a combination of fermented viper venom, blood or plasma, and feces. A person who survived would have a festering wound, though even a scratch could result in death, sometimes drawn out.
Regardless of the cause of the wound, Philoctetes was marooned by the Greeks and harbored a grudge against Odysseus, who had advised the Atreidae to leave him. Medôn took control of Philoctetes&#x27; men, and Philoctetes himself remained on Lemnos, alone, for ten years, as the Trojan War dragged on.

Helenus, the prophetic son of King Priam of Troy, was forced under torture to reveal that one of the conditions for the Greeks to win the war was possession of the bow and arrows of Heracles. Upon hearing this, Odysseus and a group of men (usually including Diomedes) rushed back to Lemnos to recover Heracles&#x27; weapons. In the tragedy by Sophocles titled &quot;Philoctetes&quot;, Odysseus is accompanied by Neoptolemus, Achilles&#x27; son, also known as Pyrrhus. (Other versions of the myth don&#x27;t include Neoptolemus.) Surprised to find the archer alive, the Greeks balked on what to do next. Odysseus tricked the weaponry away from Philoctetes, but Diomedes ( or Neoptolemus in &quot;Philoctetes&quot;, 1373ff.) refused to take the weapons without the man. The divine Heracles came down from Olympus and told Philoctetes to go and that he would be healed by the son of Asclepius and win great honor as a hero of the Achaean army.
Once back in military company outside Troy, they employed either Machaon the surgeon or more likely Podalirius the physician, both sons of the immortal physician Asclepius, to heal his wound permanently. Philoctetes challenged and would have killed Paris, son of Priam, in single combat were it not for the debates over future Greek strategy. In one version it was Philoctetes who killed Paris. He shot four times: the first arrow went wide; the second struck his bow hand; the third hit him in the right eye; the fourth hit him in the heel, so there was no need of a fifth shot. Philoctetes sided with Neoptolemus about continuing to try to storm the city. They were the only two to think so because they had not had the war-weariness of the prior ten years. Afterward, Philoctetes was among those chosen to hide inside the Trojan Horse, and during the sack of the city he killed many famed Trojans.

According to another myth, Pylius (Πύλιος), the son of god Hephaestus, healed Philoctetes at Lemnos.

A scholiast commenting on Apollonius&#x27;s &quot;Argonautica&quot; lists Philoctetes as one of the male lovers of Heracles.

==Cult and cities==

The author of the Aristotelian Corpus writes that Philoctetes lived at the Macalla after he returned from the Trojan War, and adds that the hero had deposited there in the temple of Apollo Halius the bow and arrows of Hercules, which had, however, been removed by the Crotoniats to the temple of Apollo in their own city. In addition, the author mention that Philoctetes is honored among the Sybarites.
According to Lycophron, at Macalla the inhabitants built a great shrine above his grave and glorified him as an everlasting god with libations and sacrifice of oxen.

Justin writes that people say that the city of Thurii was built by Philoctetes and his monument is seen there even to his days, as well as the arrows of Hercules which laid up in the temple of Apollo.

Solinus, Strabo and Virgil write that Petilia was established by Philoctetes.

Strabo writes that also Krimisa and Chone were established by Philoctetes. In addition, Strabo write that some of Philoctetes&#x27;s companions fortified Aegesta.

On a barren island near Lemnos there was an altar of Philoctetes with a brazen serpent, bows and breastplate bound with strips, to remind of the sufferings of the hero.

==Modern depictions==
===Drama===
* The legend of Philoctetes was used by André Gide in his play &quot;Philoctète&quot;.
* The East German postmodern dramatist Heiner Müller produced a successful adaptation of Sophocles&#x27; play in 1968 in Munich. It became one of his most-performed plays.
* John Jesurun wrote the &quot;Philoktetes-variations&quot; in 1993 on Ron Vawter&#x27;s request, it was the actor&#x27;s last piece of work, considered his artistic testament, being performed while the actor was dying of AIDS. The play has consequently also become a metaphor for AIDS, with Philoktetes as a plagued outcast.
* &quot;The Cure at Troy&quot; (1991) is an often-quoted adaptation of Sophocles&#x27; tragedy by Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney.

===Poetry===
*The myth of Philoctetes is the inspiration for William Wordsworth&#x27;s sonnet &quot;When Philoctetes in the Lemnian Isle,&quot; though here the thematic focus is not the Greek warrior&#x27;s magical bow or gruesome injury, but his abandonment. The poem is about the companionship and solace provided by Nature when all human society has been withdrawn.
*In Richard Aldington&#x27;s &quot;The Eaten Heart&quot; (1929) the rescue of Philoctetes by Neoptolemus becomes a metaphor for the loneliness of the human soul and its release when it experiences love for another human being.

===Novels===
*The legend of Philoctetes was, in part, the inspiration for Robert Silverberg&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;The Man in the Maze&quot;.
*In the 1998 novel &quot;Sirena&quot; by Donna Jo Napoli, Philoctetes is the love interest of the protagonist, a mermaid named Sirena. She sees him marooned on Lemnos and defies Hera in order to tend his wound. Falling in love, they live together for many years until he is summoned to fight at Troy. They reluctantly part ways knowing that while Philoctetes will finally be healed, they will never see each other again.

<text>Pioneer 0 (also known as Able 1) was a failed United States space probe that was designed to go into orbit around the Moon, carrying a television camera, a micrometeorite detector and a magnetometer. It was part of the first International Geophysical Year (IGY) science payload. It was designed and operated by the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division as the first spacecraft in the Pioneer program and was the first attempted launch beyond Earth orbit by any country, but the rocket failed shortly after launch. The probe was intended to be called Pioneer (or Pioneer 1), but the launch failure precluded that name.
== Spacecraft design ==
The spacecraft consisted of a thin cylindrical midsection with a squat truncated cone frustum of high on each side. The cylinder was in diameter and the height from the top of one cone to the top of the opposite cone was 76 cm. Along the axis of the spacecraft and protruding from the end of the lower cone was an solid propellant injection rocket and rocket case, which formed the main structural member of the spacecraft. Eight small low-thrust solid propellant velocity adjustment rockets were mounted on the end of the upper cone in a ring assembly which could be jettisoned after use. A magnetic dipole antenna also protruded from the top of the upper cone. The shell was composed of laminated plastic and was painted with a pattern of dark and light stripes to help regulate temperature.

The scientific instrument package had a mass of and consisted of:
* An image scanning infrared television system of the &quot;Naval Ordnance Test Station&quot; (NOTS) design to study the Moon&#x27;s surface, particularly the part normally unseen from Earth.
* A diaphragm/microphone assembly to detect micrometeorites. A micrometeorite hitting the diaphragm would generate an acoustic pulse that would travel through the diaphragm to the microphone. The microphone contained a piezoelectrical crystal that rang at 100 kc under influence of the acoustic pulse. A bandpass amplifier would amplify the signal, so it could be detected.
* A search-coil magnetometer with nonlinear amplifier to measure the Earth&#x27;s, Moon&#x27;s and interplanetary magnetic field. At the time, it was not known whether the Moon had a magnetic field or not.

The spacecraft was powered by nickel-cadmium batteries for ignition of the rockets, silver cell batteries for the television system, and mercury batteries for the remaining circuits. Radio transmission was on 108.06 MHz, a standard frequency used by satellites in the International Geophysical Year, through an electric dipole antenna for telemetry and doppler information and a magnetic dipole antenna for the television system. Ground commands were received through the electric dipole antenna at 115 MHz. The spacecraft was to be spin-stabilized at 1.8 revolutions per second, the spin direction approximately perpendicular to the geomagnetic meridian planes of the trajectory.

== Launch and failure ==
Pioneer 0 was launched on Thor missile number 127 at 12:18:00 GMT on 17 August 1958 by the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division, only 4 minutes after the scheduled launch time. It was destroyed by an explosion of the first stage of the Thor booster, 73.6 seconds after lift-off at altitude, downrange over the Atlantic Ocean. The failure was suspected to be due to a turbopump bearing that came loose, causing the liquid oxygen pump to stop. The abrupt loss of thrust caused the Thor to lose attitude control and pitch downward, which caused the LOX tank to rupture from aerodynamic loads and resulting in complete destruction of the launch vehicle. Erratic telemetry signals were received from the payload and upper stages for 123 seconds after the explosion, and the upper stages were tracked to impact in the ocean. The original plan was for the spacecraft to travel for 2.6 days to the Moon, at which time a TX-8-6 solid-propellant motor would fire to put it into a lunar orbit which was to nominally last for about two weeks. Air Force officials stated that they were not surprised at the failure, adding that &quot;it would have been more of a shock had the mission succeeded.&quot;
It was the only mission in the Project Able-1 Probes (USAF) entirely run by the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division, as subsequent missions were conducted by NASA.

<text>Pioneer 2 (also known as Able 3) was the last of the three project Able space probes designed to probe lunar and space. The launch took place at 07:30:21 GMT on 8 November 1958. After Pioneer 1 had failed due to guidance system deficiencies, the guidance system was modified with a Doppler command system to ensure more accurate commands and minimize trajectory errors. Once again, the first and second stage portion of the flight was uneventful, but the third stage of the launch vehicle failed to ignite, making it impossible for Pioneer 2 to achieve orbital velocity. An attempt to fire the vernier engines on the probe was unsuccessful and the spacecraft attained a maximum altitude of before reentering Earth&#x27;s atmosphere at 28.7° N, 1.9° E over NW Africa.

A small amount of data was obtained during the short flight, including evidence that the equatorial region around Earth has higher flux and higher energy radiation than previously considered and that the micrometeorite density is higher around Earth than in space. The reason for the third stage failure was unclear, but it was suspected that the firing command from the second stage, which contained the guidance package for the entire launch vehicle, was never received, possibly due to damage to electrical lines during staging.

== Spacecraft design ==

Pioneer 2 (NSSDCA ID: PION2) was nearly identical to Pioneer 1. It consisted of a thin cylindrical midsection with a squat truncated cone frustum on each side. The cylinder was in diameter and the height from the top of one cone to the top of the opposite cone was . Along the axis of the spacecraft and protruding from the end of the lower cone was a solid propellant injection rocket and rocket case, which formed the main structural member of the spacecraft. Eight small low-thrust solid propellant velocity adjustment rockets were mounted on the end of the upper cone in a ring assembly which could be jettisoned after use. A magnetic dipole antenna also protruded from the top of the upper cone. The shell was composed of laminated plastic. The total mass of the spacecraft after vernier separation but before injection rocket firing was .

The scientific instrument package had a mass of 15.6 kg (34.4 lb) and consisted of an STL image-scanning television system (which replaced the NOTS (&quot;Naval Ordnance Test Station&quot;) image scanning infrared television system on Pioneer 1), a proportional counter for radiation measurements, an ionization chamber to measure radiation in space, a diaphragm/microphone assembly to detect micrometeorites, a spin-coil magnetometer to measure magnetic fields to 5 microgauss, and temperature-variable resistors to record spacecraft internal conditions. The spacecraft was powered by nickel-cadmium batteries for ignition of the rockets, silver cell batteries for the television system, and mercury batteries for the remaining circuits. The radio transmission was at 108.06 MHz through a magnetic dipole antenna for the television system, telemetry, and doppler. Ground commands were received at 115 MHz. The spacecraft was to be spin-stabilized at 1.8 revolutions per second, the spin direction approximately perpendicular to the geomagnetic meridian planes of the trajectory.

<text>Pioneer 1 (also known as Able 2) was an American space probe, the first under the auspices of NASA, which was launched by a Thor-Able rocket on 11 October 1958. It was intended to orbit the Moon and make scientific measurements, but due to a guidance error failed to achieve lunar orbit and was ultimately destroyed upon reentering Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The flight, which lasted 43 hours and reached an apogee of 113,800 km (70,700 miles), was the second and most successful of the three Thor-Able space probes.

== Spacecraft design ==

Pioneer 1 was fabricated by Space Technology Laboratories, a division of Ramo-Wooldridge Corp (later TRW Inc.), and consisted of a thin cylindrical midsection with a squat truncated cone on each side. The cylinder was in diameter and the height from the top of one cone to the top of the opposite cone was . Along the axis of the spacecraft and protruding from the end of the lower cone was an solid propellant injection rocket and rocket case, which formed the main structural member of the spacecraft. Eight small low-thrust solid propellant velocity adjustment rockets were mounted on the end of the upper cone in a ring assembly which could be jettisoned after use. A magnetic dipole antenna also protruded from the top of the upper cone. The shell was composed of laminated plastic. The total mass of the spacecraft after vernier separation was , after injection rocket firing it would have been .

The three-stage Thor-Able vehicle consisted of a modified Air Force Thor IRBM (liquid propellant, thrust about ) as the first stage. A liquid-propellant rocket engine powered the second stage (modified Vanguard second stage, thrust about ). The third stage was a solid-propellant unit based on Vanguard design, rated at -sec total impulse.

The scientific instrument package had a mass of and consisted of an image scanning infrared television system to study the Moon&#x27;s surface to a resolution of 0.5°, an ionization chamber to measure radiation in space, a diaphragm/microphone assembly to detect micrometeorites, a spin-coil magnetometer to measure magnetic fields to 5 microgauss, and temperature-variable resistors to record the spacecraft&#x27;s internal conditions. The spacecraft was powered by nickel-cadmium batteries for ignition of the rockets, silver cell batteries for the television system, and mercury batteries for the remaining circuits. The radio transmission was on 108.06 MHz through an electric dipole antenna for telemetry and doppler information at 300 mW and a magnetic dipole antenna for the television system at 50 W. Ground commands were received through the electric dipole antenna at 115 MHz. The spacecraft was spin-stabilized at 1.8 rps, the spin direction was approximately perpendicular to the geomagnetic meridian planes of the trajectory.

== Mission ==
Two days after the failure of Pioneer 0 on 17 August 1958, Thor 129, the backup vehicle, was erected on LC-17B in preparation for a September attempt. The postflight investigation of Pioneer 0 pointed to a turbopump failure, which had also caused the loss of Thor-Able 116 in April. This was followed by the failure of an Atlas launch on 18 September, so the Air Force moved to replace the turbopumps in their inventory of Thor and Atlas missiles. Thor 129 was pulled from the pad for modifications and replaced with Thor 130.

On 11 October 1958, Pioneer 1 lifted off smoothly, but the guidance system steered the Thor slightly too high and fast, causing the second stage to be lofted 3° higher than intended. As a result, it shut off 10 seconds earlier than planned, and also bumped the third stage during separation. The third stage was left pitched up about 15° and suffering a velocity shortfall of about 500 feet per second. The vernier engines on the third stage were fired to make up for the thrust deficit, but added only 150 feet per second of velocity, insufficient to escape Earth orbit. As a last resort, ground controllers decided that if they could not get Pioneer 1 to the Moon, they would place it in a high Earth orbit by firing the attached solid rocket motor. The inaccurate launch trajectory, however, had placed the probe on an orbital track that resulted in thermal heating and cooling beyond what the primitive temperature control system could handle. The probe&#x27;s internals fell to near-freezing temperatures, rendering the solid motor igniter inoperable. Pioneer 1 reached a total distance of before beginning its descent back to Earth.

The spacecraft was launched from LC-17A at Cape Canaveral at 08:42:00 GMT but it did not reach the Moon as planned due to a programming error in the upper stage causing a slight error in burnout velocity and angle (3.5°). This resulted in a ballistic trajectory with a peak altitude of around 13:00 local time. The real-time transmission was obtained for about 75% of the flight, but the percentage of data recorded for each experiment was variable. Except for the first hour of flight, the signal-to-noise ratio was good. The spacecraft ended transmission when it reentered the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere after 43 hours of flight on 13 October 1958 at 03:46 GMT over the South Pacific Ocean. A small quantity of useful scientific information was returned, showing the radiation surrounding Earth was in the form of bands and measuring the extent of the bands, mapping the total ionizing flux, making the first observations of hydromagnetic oscillations of the magnetic field, and taking the first measurements of the density of micrometeorites and the interplanetary magnetic field.

<text>Pioneer 3 was a spin-stabilized spacecraft launched at 05:45:12 GMT on 6 December 1958 by the U.S. Army Ballistic Missile Agency in conjunction with NASA, using a Juno II rocket. This spacecraft was intended as a lunar probe, but failed to go past the Moon and into a heliocentric orbit as planned. It did however reach an altitude of 102,360 km before falling back to Earth. The revised spacecraft objectives were to measure radiation in the outer Van Allen radiation belt using two Geiger-Müller tubes and to test the trigger mechanism for a lunar photographic experiment.

== Spacecraft design ==

Pioneer 3 was a cone-shaped probe 58 cm high and 25 cm diameter at its base. The cone was composed of a thin fiberglass shell coated with a gold wash to make it electrically conducting and painted with black and white stripes to maintain the temperature between 10 and 50 °C. At the tip of the cone was a small probe which combined with the cone itself to act as an antenna. At the base of the cone, a ring of mercury batteries provided power. A photoelectric sensor protruded from the center of the ring. The sensor was designed with two photocells which would be triggered by the light of the Moon when the probe was within about 30,000 km of the Moon. Under original plans, the probe would have carried a camera capable of taking a single photograph of the Moon, but after the discovery of the Van Allen belts by Explorer 1, the camera was replaced with a Geiger counter for radiation measurement. At the center of the cone were a voltage supply tube and two Geiger-Müller tubes. A transmitter with a mass of 0.5 kg delivered a phase-modulated signal of 0.1 W at a frequency of 960.05 MHz. The modulated carrier power was 0.08 W and the total effective radiated power 0.18 W. A despin mechanism consisted of two 7 gram weights which could be spooled out to the end of two 150 cm wires when triggered by a hydraulic timer 10 hours after launch. The weights would slow the spacecraft spin from 400 rpm to 6 rpm and then weights and wires would be released. While the Thor-Able Pioneer probes were designed to go into orbit around the Moon, the Juno Pioneer probes would crash-land instead, although, given the crude launch vehicle guidance system and direct ascent trajectory, the odds of hitting the Moon were slim. However, a lunar flyby rather than impact would still be considered a successful mission.

== Mission ==
The flight plan called for the Pioneer 3 probe to pass close to the Moon after 33.75 hours and then go into solar orbit. The Juno II lifted off from LC-5 at 05:45:12 GMT on 6 December 1958. The launch went entirely according to plan until the first stage cutoff, when the engine cut off 3.7 seconds early due to a failure of the propellant depletion sensors, leaving a velocity shortfall of several hundred feet per second. The injection angle was also about 71° instead of the planned 68°, and the de-spin mechanism also failed to operate. The spacecraft reached an altitude of 102,360 km (109,740 km from the center of the Earth) before falling back to Earth. It re-entered Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and burned up over Africa on 7 December at approximately 19:51 GMT (2:51 p.m. EST) at an estimated location of 16.4° N, 18.6° E. The probe returned telemetry for about 25 hours of its 38-hour-6-minute journey. The other 13 hours were blackout periods due to the location of the two tracking stations. The returned information showed that the internal temperature remained at about 43 °C over most of the period.

While Pioneer 3 did not meet its primary mission objective of a lunar flyby, the data obtained was of particular value to James Van Allen. The Pioneer 3 probe data in addition to the data from the previous Explorer 1 and Explorer 3 satellites led to the discovery of a distinct second radiation belt around the Earth. The trapped radiation starts at an altitude of several hundred miles from Earth (where the outer belt was first observed by Sputnik 2 and Sputnik 3) and extends for several thousand miles into space. These Van Allen radiation belts surrounding the Earth are named for Dr. James Van Allen, in honor of his discovery.

<text>In Greek mythology, Machaon (; ) was a son of Asclepius; and the older brother of Podalirius. He and his brother led an army from Tricca in the Trojan War on the side of the Greeks.

== Family ==
Machaon fathered Nicomachus and Gorgasus by Anticleia, daughter of Diocles of Pharae. His other sons were Alexanor, Sphyrus and Polemocrates.

According to Diogenes Laertius&#x27;s &quot;Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers&quot;, Hermippus, in his book &quot;On Aristotle,&quot; places Machaon as the son of Asclepius, father of Nicomachus, and ancestor of Aristotle.

== Mythology ==
Both Machaon and Podalirius were highly valued surgeons and medics. In the &quot;Iliad,&quot; he was wounded and put out of action by Paris. Machaon (or his brother) healed Philoctetes, Telephus and Menelaus, after he sustained an arrow at the hand of Pandarus, during the war. He was also supposed to possess herbs which were bestowed to his father Asclepius by Chiron, the centaur.

He was killed by Eurypylus in the tenth year of the war. He was buried in Gerenia in Messenia, where he was worshiped by the people.

In the account of Dares the Phrygian, Machaon was illustrated as &quot;. . . large and brave, dependable, prudent, patient, and merciful.&quot;
==Legacy==

* The Latin name of a butterfly Old World Swallowtail (&quot;Papilio machaon&quot;) is derived from Machaon.
* &quot;Machaonia&quot;, a plant genus in Rubiaceae, was named for Machaon.
* The Jovian trojan asteroid 3063 Makhaon is named after him.

<text>In Greek mythology, Podalirius or Podaleirius or Podaleirios () was a son of Asclepius.

== Mythology ==

=== Trojan war ===
With Machaon, his brother, he led thirty ships from Tricca, Thessaly in the Trojan War on the side of the Greeks. Like Machaon, he was a legendary healer. He healed Philoctetes, holder of the bow and arrows of Heracles required to end the war. He was one of those who entered the Trojan Horse. Alongside Amphilochus, Calchas, Leonteus and Polypoetes he traveled to Colophon, where Calchas died.

=== Aftermath ===
Unlike his brother, Podalirius survived the war, and subsequently settled in Caria. Accounts vary as to how he ended up there. According to one version, he returned to Argos after the war but later went on to consult the Delphian oracle about a preferable place for himself to live, and was instructed to stay at a place where he would suffer no harm should the sky fall; thus he chose the Carian peninsula which was surrounded by mountains. Others relate that on the way back from Troy Podalirius&#x27; ship was blown off course so he landed in Syrnus, Caria, where he settled. In yet another version, he got shipwrecked near the Carian coast but was rescued by a shepherd named Bybassus, the eponym-to-be of a city in Caria. Podalirus could be the founder of Syrnus, which he became after the following series of events. Podalirius arrived at the court of the Carian king Damaethus and healed the king&#x27;s daughter Syrna, who had fallen off a roof. In reward, Damaethus gave him Syrna in marriage and handed the power over the peninsula over to him. Podalirus founded two cities, one of which he named Syrnus after his wife and the other Bybassus after the shepherd to whom he owed his life.

According to Strabo, a heroön of Podalirius, and another of Calchas, were located in Daunia, Italy, on a hill known as Drium. By the hero-shrine of Podalirius there flowed a stream believed to cure animals of any diseases. Lycophron writes that Podalirius was buried in Italy near the cenotaph of Calchas, but John Tzetzes accuses him of providing false information and defends the versions cited above.

In the account of Dares the Phrygian, Podalirius is described as &quot;sturdy, strong, haughty, and moody.&quot;

<text>Luna 1, also known as Mechta ( , &quot;lit.&quot;: &quot;Dream&quot;), E-1 No.4 and &quot;First Lunar Rover&quot;, was the first spacecraft to reach the vicinity of Earth&#x27;s Moon, the first spacecraft to leave Earth&#x27;s orbit, and the first to be placed in heliocentric orbit. Intended as a Moon impactor, &quot;Luna 1&quot; was launched as part of the Soviet Luna programme in 1959.

A malfunction in the ground-based control system caused an error in the upper stage rocket&#x27;s burn time, and the spacecraft missed the Moon by 5,900 km (more than three times the Moon&#x27;s radius). &quot;Luna 1&quot; became the first human-made object to reach heliocentric orbit and was dubbed &quot;Artificial Planet 1&quot; and renamed &quot;Mechta&quot; (&quot;Dream&quot;). &quot;Luna 1&quot; was also referred to as the &quot;First Cosmic Ship&quot;, in reference to its achievement of Earth escape velocity.

==Spacecraft==

The satellite and rocket carrying &quot;Luna 1&quot; was originally referred to as the Soviet Space Rocket by the Soviet Press. Pravda writer Alexander Kazantsev called it &quot;Mechta&quot; (, meaning &#x27;dream&#x27;). Citizens of Moscow unofficially deemed it &quot;Lunik&quot;, a combination of Luna (Moon) and Sputnik. It was renamed to &quot;Luna 1&quot; in 1963.

The spherical satellite was powered by mercury-oxide batteries and silver-zinc accumulators. There were five antenna on one hemisphere, four whip-style and one rigid, for communication purposes. The spacecraft also contained radio equipment including a tracking transmitter and telemetry system. There was no propulsion system.

&quot;Luna 1&quot; was designed to impact the Moon, delivering two metallic pennants with the Soviet coat of arms that were included into its payload package. It also had six instruments to study the Moon upon its suicidal approach. The flux-gate magnetometer was triaxial and could measure ± 3000 gammas. It was designed to detect lunar magnetic fields. Two micrometeorite detectors, developed by Tatiana Nazarova of the Vernadsky Institute, were installed on the spacecraft. They each consisted of a metal plate with springs and could detect small impacts. Four ion traps, used to measure solar wind and plasma, were included. They were developed by Konstantin Gringauz. The scientific payload also included two gas-discharge Geiger counters, a sodium-iodide scintillation counter, and a Cherenkov detector. The upper stage of the rocket contained a scintillation counter and of sodium for a gas-dispersion experiment.

The spacecraft weighed at launch. It was about in diameter.

==Launch==

&quot;Luna 1&quot; was launched at 16:41 GMT (22:41 local time) on 2 January 1959 from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome by a Luna 8K72 rocket. The first three stages operated nominally. The Soviet engineers did not trust automated systems for controlling the engine burns, so they communicated to the rocket via radio. The signal to stop firing the engine Block E stage was delayed, and the prolonged burn imparted an extra 175 m/s to &quot;Luna 1&quot;. 

Consequently &quot;Luna 1&quot; missed its target by . The spacecraft passed within of the Moon&#x27;s surface on 4 January after 34 hours of flight, and then became the first human made object to leave Earth&#x27;s orbit on January 6, 1959. &quot;Luna 1&quot; ran out of battery power on 5 January, when it was from Earth, making it impossible to track further. The batteries were designed for a minimum of 40 hours but lasted for 62.

&quot;Luna 1&quot; became the first artificial object to reach the escape velocity of the Earth, along with its carrier rocket&#x27;s upper stage, which it separated from after being the first spacecraft to reach heliocentric orbit. It remains in orbit around the Sun, between the orbits of Earth and Mars.

==Experiment results==
At 00:57 GMT on 3 January 1959, at a distance of from Earth, of sodium gas was released by the spacecraft, forming a cloud behind it to serve as an artificial comet. The cloud was released for two purposes: to allow visual tracking of the spacecraft&#x27;s trajectory and to observe the behavior of gas in space. This glowing orange trail of gas, visible over the Indian Ocean with the brightness of a sixth-magnitude star for a few minutes, was photographed by Mstislav Gnevyshev at the Mountain Station of the Main Astronomical Observatory of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR near Kislovodsk.

While traveling through the outer Van Allen radiation belt, the spacecraft&#x27;s scintillator made observations indicating that a small number of high-energy particles exist in the outer belt. The measurements obtained during this mission provided new data on the Earth&#x27;s radiation belt and outer space. The craft was unable to detect a lunar magnetic field which placed an upper limit on its strength of 1/10,000th of Earth&#x27;s. The first-ever direct observations and measurements of solar wind, a strong flow of ionized plasma emanating from the Sun and streaming through interplanetary space, were performed. The ionized plasma concentration was measured to be some 700 particles per cm3 at altitudes of 20,000–25,000 km and 300 to 400 particles per cm3 at altitudes of 100,000–150,000 km. The spacecraft also marked the first instance of radio communication at the half-million-kilometer distance.

== Reaction ==

Some doubted the veracity of the Soviets&#x27; claim of mission success. Lloyd Mallan wrote about it in a book called &quot;The Big Red Lie&quot;. Many in the West did not receive transmissions from the spacecraft even though the Soviets publicized them before the flight. By the time the Earth rotated so that scientists in America could pick up signals from the spacecraft, it was already away. In May 1959 several hearings &quot;Soviet Space Technology&quot; before the &quot;Committee on Science and Astronautics and Special Subcommittee on Lunik Probe&quot; of the United States House of Representatives attested the achievements of the Soviet mission and its sophisticated guidance technology.

The Soviet Union issued stamps to commemorate their success.

==Subsequent missions==
&quot;Luna 2&quot;, the second spacecraft of the Ye-1A series, successfully completed the mission on 13 September 1959.

<text>Luna 2 (), originally named the Second Soviet Cosmic Rocket and nicknamed Lunik 2 in contemporaneous media, was the sixth of the Soviet Union&#x27;s Luna programme spacecraft launched to the Moon, E-1 No.7. It was the first spacecraft to reach the surface of the Moon, and the first human-made object to make contact with another celestial body.

The spacecraft was launched on 12 September 1959 by the Luna 8K72 s/n I1-7B rocket. It followed a direct path to the Moon. In addition to the radio transmitters sending telemetry information back to Earth, the spacecraft released a sodium vapour cloud so the spacecraft&#x27;s movement could be visually observed. On 13 September 1959, it impacted the Moon&#x27;s surface east of Mare Imbrium near the craters Aristides, Archimedes, and Autolycus.

Prior to impact, two sphere-shaped pennants with USSR and the launch date engraved in Cyrillic were detonated, sending pentagonal shields in all directions. &quot;Luna 2&quot; did not detect radiation or magnetic belts around the Moon.

== Background ==
&quot;Luna 1&quot; and the three spacecraft of Luna programme before it were part of the Ye-1 series of spacecraft with a mass of . Luna missions that failed to successfully launch or achieve good results remained unnamed and were not publicly acknowledged. The first unnamed probe exploded on launch on 23 September 1958. Two more launches were unsuccessfully attempted on 11 October 1958 and 4 December 1958. &quot;Luna 1&quot; was the fourth launch attempt and the first partial success of the program. It launched on 2 January 1959 and missed the Moon by .

One mission separated &quot;Luna 1&quot; and &quot;Luna 2&quot;, a launch failure that occurred with an unnamed probe on 18 June 1959. &quot;Luna 2&quot; would be the Soviet Union&#x27;s sixth attempt to impact the Moon. It was the second of the Ye-1a series, modified to carry a heavier payload of and had a combined mass of . &quot;Luna 2&quot; was similar in design to &quot;Luna 1&quot;, a spherical space probe with protruding antennas and instrumentation. The instrumentation was also similar to &quot;Luna 1&quot;, which included a triaxial fluxgate magnetometer, a piezoelectric detector, a scintillation counter, ion traps and two gas-discharge counters, while the &quot;Luna 2&quot; included six gas-discharge counters. There were no propulsion systems on &quot;Luna 2&quot; itself.

== Payload ==
&quot;Luna 2&quot; carried five different types of instruments to conduct various tests while it was on its way to the Moon. The scintillation counters were used to measure any ionizing radiation and the Cherenkov radiation detectors to measure electromagnetic radiation caused by charged particles. The primary scientific purpose of the Geiger Counter carried on &quot;Luna 2&quot; was to determine the electron spectrum of the Van Allen radiation belt. It consisted of three STS-5 gas-discharge counters mounted on the outside of an airtight container. The last instrument on &quot;Luna 2&quot; was a three component fluxgate magnetometer. It was similar to that used on &quot;Luna 1&quot; but its dynamic range was reduced by a factor of 4 to ±750 gammas (nT) so that the quantisation uncertainty was ±12 gammas. The probe&#x27;s instrumentation was powered by silver-zinc and mercury-oxide batteries.

The spacecraft also carried Soviet pennants which were located on the probe and on the &quot;Luna 2&quot; rocket. The two sphere-shaped pennants in the probe had surfaces covered by 72 pentagonal elements in a pattern similar to that later used by association footballs. In the centre was an explosive charge designed to shatter the sphere, sending the pentagonal shields in all directions. Each pentagonal element was made of titanium alloy; the centre regular pentagon had the State Emblem of the Soviet Union with the Cyrillic letters &quot;СССР&quot; (&quot;USSR&quot;) engraved below and was surrounded by five non-regular pentagons which were each engraved with &quot;СССР СЕНТЯБРЬ 1959&quot; (&quot;USSR SEPTEMBER 1959&quot;). The third pennant was similar engravings on aluminium strips which were embossed on the last stage of the &quot;Luna 2&quot; rocket.

The scientists took extra, unspecified precautions in preventing biological contamination of the Moon.

== Mission ==
=== Launch and trajectory ===
There was difficulty getting Luna 2 ready for launch. The first attempt on September 6 failed due to a loose electrical connection. A second attempt two days later also went awry when the core stage LOX tank failed to pressurize properly due to ice formation in a pressure sensing line. The ice plug was broken but the launch had to be called off again. By this point the RP-1 had been sitting in the propellant tanks for almost four days and there was the risk that it could start to paraffin-ize. The next attempt on September 9 was made. Core and strap-on ignition began but the engines only reached 75% thrust. The launch was aborted and the RP-1 finally drained from the tanks. The DP-2 electrical switch had failed to send the command to open the engine valves to full throttle.The booster was removed from the pad and replaced with a different one, which was launched 12 September 1959, and &quot;Luna 2&quot; lifted off at 06:39:42 GMT.

Later in the month, Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev was visiting the United States. The US space program had had several recent setbacks including an on-pad explosion of an Atlas-Able rocket and a Jupiter missile that exploded just after launch and killed several mice it was intended to fly on a biological mission. US President Dwight Eisenhower, while meeting with Khrushchev, remarked that there had been a few failures of American rockets lately and asked if there had been similar problems in the Soviet space programme. Alluding to the abortive Luna 2 attempt two weeks earlier, Khrushchev replied that &quot;We had a rocket we were going to launch, but it did not work correctly so they had to take it down and replace it with a different one.&quot;

Once the vehicle reached Earth&#x27;s escape velocity, the upper stage was detached, allowing the probe to travel on its path to the Moon. &quot;Luna 2&quot; pirouetted slowly, making a full rotation every 14 minutes, while sending radio signals at 183.6, 19.993 and 39.986 MHz. The probe started transmitting information back to Earth using three different transmitters. These transmitters provided precise information on its course, allowing scientists to calculate that &quot;Luna 2&quot; would hit its mark on the Moon around 00:05 on 14 September (Moscow Time), which was announced on Radio Moscow.

Because of claims that information received from &quot;Luna 1&quot; was fake, the Russian scientists sent a telex to astronomer Bernard Lovell at Jodrell Bank Observatory at the University of Manchester. Having received the intended time of impact, and the transmission and trajectory details, it was Bernard Lovell who confirmed the mission&#x27;s success to outside observers. However, the American media were still skeptical of the data until Lovell was able to prove that the radio signal was coming from &quot;Luna 2&quot; by showing the Doppler shift from its transmissions.

=== Lunar impact ===
&quot;Luna 2&quot; took a direct path to the Moon, starting with an initial velocity from Earth of and impacting the Moon at about . It hit the Moon about 0° west and 29.1° north of the centre of the visible disk at 00:02:24 (Moscow Time) on 14 September 1959. The probe became the first human-made object to hit another celestial body. To provide a display visible from Earth, on 13 September the spacecraft released a vapour cloud that expanded to a diameter of that was seen by observatories in Alma Ata in Kazakhstan, Byurakan in Armenia, Abastumani and Tbilisi in Georgia, and Stalinabad in Tajikistan. This cloud also acted as an experiment to see how the sodium gas would act in a vacuum and zero gravity. The last stage of the rocket that propelled &quot;Luna 2&quot; also hit the Moon&#x27;s surface about 30 minutes after the spacecraft, but there was uncertainty about where it landed.

Bernard Lovell began tracking the probe about five hours before it struck the Moon and also recorded the transmission from the probe, which ended abruptly. He played the recording during a phone call to reporters in New York to finally convince most media observers of the mission&#x27;s authenticity.

== Results ==
The radiation detectors and magnetometer were searching for lunar magnetic and radiation fields similar to the Van Allen radiation belt around Earth, sending information about once every minute until its last transmission which came about away from the lunar surface. Although it did prove previous measurements of the Van Allen radiation belts that were taken from &quot;Luna 1&quot; around the Earth, it was not able to detect any type of radiation belts around the Moon at or beyond the limits of its magnetometer&#x27;s sensitivity (2–3x10−4 G).

&quot;Luna 2&quot; showed time variations in the electron flux and energy spectrum in the Van Allen radiation belt. Using ion traps on board, the satellite made the first direct measurement of solar wind flux from outside the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere. On its approach to the lunar surface, the probe did not detect any notable magnetic field to within from the Moon. It also did not detect a radiation belt around the Moon, but the four ion traps measured an increase in the ion particle flux at an altitude of , which suggested the presence of an ionosphere. The probe generated scientific data that was printed on of teletype, which were analysed and published in the spring of 1960.

== Cultural significance ==
According to Donald William Cox, Americans were starting to believe that they were making progress in the Space Race and that although the Soviet Union might have had larger rockets, the United States had better guidance systems, but these beliefs were questioned when the Soviets were able to impact &quot;Luna 2&quot; on the Moon. At that time the closest Americans had come to the Moon was about with Pioneer 4. Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, on his only visit to the United States, gave President Dwight D. Eisenhower a replica of the Soviet pennants that &quot;Luna 2&quot; had just placed onto the lunar surface.
==U.S. espionage==
In 1959, a Soviet exhibit of its economic achievements toured several countries. This exhibit included displays of Luna 2. CIA conducted a covert operation to access it to gain information. A team of CIA officers gained unrestricted access to the display for 24 hours, which turned out to be a fully-operational system comparable to the original and not a replica as expected. The team disassembled the object, photographed the parts without removing it from its crate and then put back in place, gaining intelligence regarding its design and capabilities. The Soviets did not find out, the CIA report being declassified in 2019, 24 years after the dissolution of the USSR.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Luna 2&quot; was a success for the Soviets, and was the first in a series of missions (lunar impactors) that were intentionally crashed on the Moon. The later U.S.-made Ranger missions ended in similar impacts. Such controlled crashes have remained useful even after the technique of soft landing was mastered. NASA used hard spacecraft impacts to test whether shadowed Moon craters contain ice by analyzing the debris that was created on impact.

The pennant presented to Eisenhower is kept at the Eisenhower Presidential Library and Museum in Abilene, Kansas, U.S. A copy of the spherical pennant is located at the Kansas Cosmosphere in Hutchinson, Kansas.

On 1 November 1959, the Soviet Union released two stamps commemorating the spacecraft. They depict the trajectory of the mission.

<text>In the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Mentor (Greek: Μέντωρ, &quot;Méntōr&quot;; gen.: Μέντορος) was the son of Alcimus. In his old age Mentor was a friend of Odysseus. When Odysseus left for the Trojan War, he placed Mentor in charge of his son Telemachus, and of Odysseus&#x27; palace.

Athena&#x27;s appearance as Mentor should not be confused with her appearance as Mentes in the first book of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;.

==Mentor as term==
Because of Mentor&#x27;s relationship with Telemachus, and the disguised Athena&#x27;s encouragement and practical plans for dealing with personal dilemmas, the personal name &quot;Mentor&quot; has been adopted in Latin and other languages, including English, as a term meaning someone who imparts wisdom to and shares knowledge with a less-experienced colleague.

The first recorded modern usage of the term can be traced to a 1699 book entitled &quot;Les Aventures de Télémaque&quot; by the French writer François Fénelon. In the book the lead character is that of Mentor. This book was very popular during the 18th century and the modern application of the term can be traced to this publication.

<text>Luna 3, or E-2A No.1 (), was a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1959 as part of the Luna programme. It was the first mission to photograph the far side of the Moon and the third Soviet space probe to be sent to the neighborhood of the Moon. The historic, never-before-seen views of the far side of the Moon caused excitement and interest when they were published around the world, and a tentative &quot;Atlas of the Far Side of the Moon&quot; was created from the pictures.

These views showed mountainous terrain, very different from the near side, and only two dark, low-lying regions, which were named Mare Moscoviense (Sea of Moscow) and Mare Desiderii (Sea of Desire). Mare Desiderii was later found to be composed of a smaller mare, Mare Ingenii (Sea of Cleverness), and several other dark craters. The reason for this difference between the two sides of the Moon is still not fully understood, but it seems that most of the dark lavas that flowed out to produce the maria formed under the Earth-facing half.

== Design ==
The space probe was a cylindric canister with hemispheric ends and a wide flange near the top. The probe was long and at its maximum diameter at the flange. Most of the cylindric section was roughly in diameter. The canister was hermetically sealed and pressurized to about . Several solar cells were mounted on the outside of the cylinder, and these provided electric power to the storage batteries inside the space probe.

Shutters for thermal control were positioned along the cylinder and opened to expose a radiating surface when the internal temperature exceeded . The upper hemisphere of the probe held the covered opening for the cameras. Four antennas protruded from the top of the probe and two from its bottom. Other scientific equipment was mounted on the outside, including micrometeoroid and cosmic ray detectors, and the Yenisey-2 imaging system. The gas jets for its attitude control system were mounted on the lower end of the spacecraft. Several photoelectric cells helped maintain orientation with respect to the Sun and the Moon.

There were no rocket motors for course corrections.

Its interior held the cameras and the photographic film processing system, radio transmitter, storage batteries, gyroscopic units, and circulating fans for temperature control. It was spin-stabilized for most of its flight, but its three-axis attitude control system was activated while taking photos. Luna 3 was radio-controlled from ground stations in the Soviet Union.

The Soviet media called the spacecraft the Automatic Interplanetary Station. The probe was renamed to &quot;Luna 3&quot; in 1963.

== Mission ==

After launching on a Luna 8K72 (number I1-8) rocket over the North Pole, the Blok-E escape stage was shut down by radio control to put Luna 3 on its course to the Moon. Initial radio contact showed that the signal from the space probe was only about one-half as strong as expected, and the internal temperature was rising. The spacecraft spin axis was reoriented and some equipment was shut down, resulting in a temperature drop from 40 °C to about 30 °C. At a distance of 60,000 to 70,000 km from the Moon, the orientation system was turned on and the spacecraft rotation was stopped. The lower end of the craft was pointed at the Sun, which was shining on the far side of the Moon.

The space probe passed within 6,200 km of the Moon near its south pole at the closest lunar approach at 14:16 UT on 6 October 1959, and continued over the far side. On 7 October, the photocell on the upper end of the space probe detected the sunlit far side of the Moon, and the photography sequence was started. The first picture was taken at 03:30 UT at a distance of 63,500 km from the Moon, and the last picture was taken 40 minutes later from a distance of 66,700 km.

A total of 29 pictures were taken, covering 70% of the far side. After the photography was complete the spacecraft resumed spinning, passed over the north pole of the Moon and returned towards the Earth. Attempts to transmit the pictures to the Soviet Union began on 8 October but the early attempts were unsuccessful due to the low signal strength. As Luna 3 drew closer to the Earth, a total of about 17 photographs were transmitted by 18 October. All contact with the probe was lost on 22 October 1959. The space probe was believed to have burned up in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere in March or April 1960. Another possibility was that it survived in orbit until 1962 or later.

It was launched initially in an orbit with the perigee outside the upper boundary of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. After the mission was accomplished, and the probe made several orbits around the Earth, the secular rise in the eccentricity resulted in a decrease of the perigee because the semimajor axis is conserved. After eleven orbital revolutions Luna-3 entered the atmosphere of the Earth. It is the first instance of a &quot;man-made Lidov-Kozai effect&quot;.

===First gravity assist===

The gravity assist maneuver was first used in 1959 when Luna 3 photographed the far side of Earth&#x27;s Moon. After launch from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Luna 3 passed behind the Moon from south to north and headed back to Earth. The gravity of the Moon changed the spacecraft&#x27;s orbit; also, because of the Moon&#x27;s own orbital motion, the spacecraft&#x27;s orbital plane was also changed. The return orbit was calculated so that the spacecraft passed again over the Northern hemisphere where the Soviet ground stations were located. The maneuver relied on research performed under the direction of Mstislav Keldysh at the Steklov Institute of Mathematics.
== Lunar photography ==


The purpose of this experiment was to obtain photographs of the lunar surface as the spacecraft flew by the Moon. The imaging system was designated Yenisey-2 and consisted of a dual-lens camera AFA-E1, an automatic film processing unit, and a scanner. The lenses on the camera were a 200 mm focal length, &quot;f&quot;/5.6 aperture objective and a 500 mm, &quot;f&quot;/9.5 objective. The camera carried 40 frames of American-made temperature- and radiation-resistant 35mm isochrome film recovered by the Soviets from downed American Genetrix espionage balloons. The 200 mm objective could image the full disk of the Moon and the 500 mm could take an image of a region on the surface. The camera was fixed in the spacecraft and pointing was achieved by rotating the craft itself.

Luna 3 was the first successful three-axis stabilized spacecraft. During most of the mission, the spacecraft was spin stabilized, but for photography of the Moon, the spacecraft oriented one axis toward the Sun and then a photocell was used to detect the Moon and orient the cameras toward it. Detection of the Moon signaled the camera cover to open and the photography sequence to start automatically. The images alternated between both cameras during the sequence. After photography was complete, the film was moved to an on-board processor where it was developed, fixed, and dried. Commands from the Earth were then given to move the film into a flying-spot scanner where a spot produced by a cathode-ray tube was projected through the film onto a photomultiplier. The spot was scanned across the film and the photomultiplier converted the intensity of the light passing through the film into an electric signal which was transmitted to the Earth (via frequency-modulated analog video, similar to a facsimile). A frame could be scanned with a resolution of 1000 (horizontal) lines and the transmission could be done at a slow-scan television rate at large distances from the Earth and a faster rate at closer ranges.

The camera took 29 pictures over 40 minutes on 7 October 1959, from 03:30 UT to 04:10 UT at distances ranging from 63,500 km to 66,700 km above the surface, covering 70% of the lunar far side. Seventeen (some say twelve) of these frames were successfully transmitted back to the Earth (tracking stations in Crimea and Kamchatka), and six were published (frames numbered 26, 28, 29, 31, 32, and 35). They were the first photographs of the far hemisphere of the Moon.

The imaging system was developed by P.F. Bratslavets and I.A. Rosselevich at the Leningrad Scientific Research Institute for Television and the returned images were processed and analyzed by Iu.N. Lipskii and his team at the Sternberg Astronomical Institute. The camera AFA-E1 was developed and manufactured by the KMZ factory (Krasnogorskiy Mekhanicheskiy Zavod).

== Legacy ==

The images were analysed, and the first atlas of the far side of the Moon was published by the USSR Academy of Sciences on 6 November 1960. It included a catalog of 500 distinguished features of the landscape. In 1961, the first globe (1: scale) containing lunar features invisible from the Earth was released in the USSR, based on images from Luna 3. Features that were named include Mare Moscoviense and craters called after Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Jules Verne, Marie Curie and Thomas Edison.

<text>In Greek mythology, Stentor (Ancient Greek: Στέντωρ; &quot;gen&quot;.: Στέντορος) was a herald of the Greek forces during the Trojan War. 

== Mythology ==
Stentor is mentioned briefly in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; in which Hera, in the guise of Stentor, whose &quot;voice was as powerful as fifty voices of other men&quot;, encourages the Greeks to fight. 

Elsewhere, Stentor is said to have died after losing a shouting contest with Hermes.

Stentor&#x27;s story is the origin of the term &quot;stentorian&quot;, meaning loud-voiced, for which he was famous. Aristotle uses the concept in his &quot;Politics&quot; Book 7, Chapter IV saying, &quot;For who can be the general of such a vast multitude, or who the herald, unless he have the voice of a Stentor?&quot;

<doc id="82001" wikidata="Q570434" url="?curid=82001" title="Idomeneus (son of Deucalion)">
<text>In Greek mythology, Idomeneus (; ) was a Cretan king and commander who led the Cretan armies to the Trojan War, in eighty black ships. He was also one of the suitors of Helen, as well as a comrade of the Telamonian Ajax. Meriones was his charioteer and brother-in-arms.

== Description ==
Idomeneus was described by the chronicler Malalas in his account of the &quot;Chronography&quot; as &quot;above average height, dark-skinned, good eyes, well set, strong, good nose, thick beard, good head, curly hair, a berserker when fighting&quot;.

== Family ==
Idomeneus was the son of Deucalion and Cleopatra, grandson of King Minos and king of Crete and Queen Pasiphaë, thus tracing his line from Helios the sun god. He was husband of Meda by whom she became the mother of Orsilochus, Cleisithyra, Iphiclus and Lycus.

== Mythology ==
In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, Idomeneus is found among the first rank of the Greek generals, leading his troops and engaging the enemy head-on, and escaping serious injury. Idomeneus was one of Agamemnon&#x27;s trusted advisors. He was one of the primary defenders when most of the other Achaean heroes were injured, and even fought Hector briefly and repulsed his attack. Like most of the other leaders of the Greeks, he is alive and well as the story comes to a close. He was one of the Achaeans to enter the Trojan Horse. Idomeneus killed twenty men and at least three Amazon women, including Bremusa, at Troy.

A later tradition, preserved by Servius the Grammarian in a commentary on Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, continues the story as follows: after the war, Idomeneus&#x27;s ship hit a terrible storm. He promised Poseidon that he would sacrifice the first living thing he saw when he returned home if Poseidon would save his ship and crew. The first living thing was his son, whom Idomeneus duly sacrificed. The gods were angry at Idomeneus&#x27;s murder of his own son and sent a plague to Crete. The Cretans sent him into exile in Calabria (ancient name of the Salento in Apulia), Italy and then Colophon in Asia Minor where he died. According to Marcus Terrentius Varro, the gens Salentini descended from Idomeneus, who had sailed from Crete to Illyria, and then together with Illyrians and Locrians from Illyria to Salento, see Grecìa Salentina.

Alternatively, in a tradition preserved by Apollodorus, Idomeneus was driven out of Crete by Leucus, his foster son, who had seduced and then killed Idomeneus&#x27; wife Meda and usurped the throne of Crete.

The tale is also covered by the French 17th century writer François Fénelon.

&quot;Idomeneo&quot;, a 1781 opera seria by Mozart, is based on the story of Idomeneus&#x27;s return to Crete. In this version, Poseidon (Neptune in the opera) spares Idomeneo&#x27;s son Idamante, on condition that Idomeneo relinquish his throne to the new generation.

<text>Luna 4, or E-6 No.4 (Ye-6 series), sometimes known in the West as Lunik 4, was a Soviet spacecraft launched as part of the Luna program to attempt the first soft landing on the Moon. Following a successful launch, the spacecraft failed to perform a course correction and as a result it missed the Moon, remaining instead in Earth orbit before possibly transitioning into a solar orbit. Though the mission was unsuccessful, it nevertheless marked a new epoch in the Space Race, which culminated in the successful landing of Luna 9 in 1966.

==Background==

On the heels of the successful Luna 3 mission, which returned the first images of the Far Side of the Moon, the Soviet Union turned its attention to learning more about the lunar surface and whether it was solid enough to land and build structures upon. To this end, on 10 December 1959, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev signed a resolution of the Central Committee and Council of Ministers for the creation of a lunar soft lander equipped with scientific instrumentation and a television. This task was assigned to a group led by Nikolay Beresnev, working in the section of Mikhail Tikhonravov&#x27;s department at OKB-1 run by Gleb Maksimov. OKB-1 chief Sergei Korolev took a personal hand in leading the project initially before handing the reins to Beresnev. By 1963, de facto management of the project had devolved onto Boris Chertok. The working designation was Ye-6 (&quot;Ye&quot; being the letter in the alphabet succeeding &quot;D&quot;, the designation given to the satellite project that became Sputnik 3).

Because of the complexity of the Ye-6 spacecraft, its mass was too great for the three-stage Luna (rocket) that had launched the previous Luna probes. The Ye-6 instead would be launched on the 8K78 booster which allowed a larger payload and provided the ability to put the probe in a parking orbit rather than the inaccurate direct ascent of the first generation Luna probes, although of the first ten 8K78 launch attempts, only two (Mars 1 and Venera 1) succeeded, the rest failing to reach orbit or being unable to leave LEO. Combined with the advanced nature of the lander, the Ye-6 team estimated that the mission had a 10% chance of success.

==Spacecraft==

The Ye-6 spacecraft consisted of a stack of three cylindrical modules, with a height of and a launch mass of . The first module was the Isayev rocket module, which held the main engine, used for mid-course correction and the descent to landing, four thrusters for attitude control, and two cruise modules. The main engine propellant was hypergolic, consisting of nitric acid and amine and producing a thrust of about 45,000 N. The four thrusters were mounted on outriggers and could produce 245 N each. A boom would be deployed from the bottom of the spacecraft, used to trigger the final landing sequence. The second module was a hermetically sealed pressurized compartment that held the propellant and oxygen and contained communication, attitude orientation, an altimeter, and the onboard control system (&quot;I-100&quot;).

Luna 4 carried an astronavigation system so that it could autonomously change course midflight. This device (SAN) was derived from similar systems developed for aircraft. The spacecraft&#x27;s autonomous control system, gyroscopes, control and logic circuits were all combined in the I-100 package that also controlled aspects of the Molniya rocket&#x27;s third and fourth stages; this was a weight-saving measure that, nevertheless, was conducive to failures, as had occurred when similar solutions had been applied to the Mars and Venera spacecraft.

The third module was the lunar lander, a diameter sphere protected by two hemispherical airbags. The sphere had a hermetically sealed compartment that held communications apparatus, batteries, thermal control systems, a timer, and the science experiments. The top of the sphere had four petals, which would open up on landing, allowing deployment of four whip antennas and the lander camera turret. Control of the lander was done by the timing device onboard or by communication from Earth. The batteries were designed to operate for a total of 5 hours over about 4 days. 

The scientific payload comprised an imaging system and an SBM-10 radiation detector. The latter was a gas-discharge counter, long and in diameter, heavily shielded on one side. Radiation counts were telemetered continuously with a statistical accuracy of about 0.1%.

The mission plan was to initialize the landing sequence at an altitude of about . At to altitude the cruise modules would be jettisoned, the main engine would start, the radar altimeter would be activated, and the lander airbags would inflate. At to altitude the main engine would shut off and the four thrusters would ignite. The meter boom would touch the surface first, causing the ejection of the lander, which would hit the surface, cushioned by the airbags, at about . The airbags would deflate, the petals would open, causing the sphere to be oriented correctly, and the antennas and instruments could be deployed.

==Mission==

After a development process fraught with technical and jurisdictional delays, the first flight version of the Ye-6 was built in December 1962. Launches on 4 January 1963 (Luna E-6 No.2) and 3 February 1963 (Luna E-6 No.3) failed--one was stuck in LEO and another failed to reach orbit.

Luna 4 was launched by a Molniya-L carrier rocket at 08:16:37 UTC on April 2, 1963. Launch occurred from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, and the mission was tracked and controlled from Simferopol, including the parabolic antenna sited there. After reaching an initial parking orbit of , the rocket&#x27;s upper stage restarted to place Luna 4 onto a translunar trajectory.

Luna 4&#x27;s initial trajectory was according to plan, but due to a failure of the Yupiter astronavigation system, most likely due to thermal control problems, the spacecraft could not be oriented properly for the planned midcourse correction burn. As a result, Luna 4 missed the Moon by about at 13:25 UT on April 5, 1963. It then entered a barycentric × Earth orbit. 

Although coverage of the flight was front page news outside of the USSR, details released by TASS, the Soviet news agency, were scant. This irritated Chertok and his team, who felt the secrecy &quot;belittle[d] the real significance of the space program and generate[d] doubt among the public as to its practicality.&quot;

Despite (and in some ways because of) the relative lack of information, Western scientists were able to deduce much about the Luna 4 (known as &quot;Lunik 4&quot;) mission. For instance, logic dictated that the next step after the prior lunar missions would be either a lunar orbiter or a soft-lander. The comparatively long mission length of 3.5 days implied a larger payload, supporting this belief. That Luna 4 missed the Moon, and by a wider margin than Luna 1 and Luna 3, thus suggested a mission failure.

Additional evidence was provided by Radio Moscow&#x27;s virtual silence regarding the flight as well as the cancellation of the television program &quot;Hitting the Moon&quot;, scheduled for 7:45pm Moscow time on April 5, coinciding with Luna 4&#x27;s arrival at the Moon. A poetry program and a piano interlude were played instead. TASS reports on the probe were uncharacteristically brief, and the last mention of the probe in the newspaper Pravda was a short reference within a general article on the Moon, which was published April 7.

==Results and status==

The spacecraft transmitted at 183.6 MHz until 15 April. French and Italian astronomers reported reception of pictures of the Moon taken by Luna 4. A telescope in Russia photographed Luna 4 early in its flight when it appeared as a 14th magnitude object. Though Luna 4 did not land on the Moon, it did return data on the radiation environment in cislunar space. The spacecraft reported variations in the radiation flux over time comparable to those measured by previous missions, but with smoother transition times. Because Luna 4, unlike its predecessors, was launched during the least active part of the solar 11 year cycle, it was conjectured that, rather than being caused by sporadic solar outbursts, that the more gentle variations detected by Luna 4 might instead be caused by changes in local magnetic field effects—normally undetectable in more active times. Luna 4 also discovered that the Earth&#x27;s geomagnetic tail seeped out at least as far as lunar orbit.

Luna 4&#x27;s path appears to have been perturbed such that it now orbits the Sun rather than the Earth. The Ye-6 program was ultimately successful, with the 12th in the series, Luna 9, landing on the Moon on 3 February 1966.

<text>Otello () is an opera in four acts by Giuseppe Verdi to an Italian libretto by Arrigo Boito, based on Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Othello&quot;. It was Verdi&#x27;s penultimate opera, first performed at the Teatro alla Scala, Milan, on 5 February 1887.

The composer was reluctant to write anything new after the success of &quot;Aida&quot; in 1871, and he retreated into retirement. It took his Milan publisher Giulio Ricordi the next ten years, first to encourage the revision of Verdi&#x27;s 1857 &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot; by introducing Boito as librettist and then to begin the arduous process of persuading and cajoling Verdi to see Boito&#x27;s completed libretto for &quot;Otello&quot; in July/August 1881. However, the process of writing the first drafts of the libretto and the years of their revision, with Verdi all along not promising anything, dragged on. It wasn&#x27;t until 1884, five years after the first drafts of the libretto, that composition began, with most of the work finishing in late 1885. When it finally premiered in Milan on 5 February 1887, it proved to be a resounding success, and further stagings of &quot;Otello&quot; soon followed at leading theatres throughout Europe and America.

==Composition history==

===Verdi&#x27;s intended retirement===
After the completion and premiere of his opera &quot;Aida&quot; in December 1871, Verdi decided that it was time for him to end his successful career as a composer of opera, much as Rossini had done after the completion of the opera &quot;William Tell&quot;, though he was easily the most popular, and possibly the wealthiest, composer in Italy at the time. However, Verdi&#x27;s sixties were not good years: as musicologist Julian Budden notes, &quot;he seemed to have entered [those years] in a mood of gloom and depression [..and..] his letters at the time were full of complaints about the Italian theatre, Italian politics and Italian music in general [all] seen by him as sinking beneath a tide of Germanism&quot;.

Because of the immense popularity of Verdi&#x27;s music in Italy by the 1870s, Verdi&#x27;s retirement seemed to his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, to be a waste of talent and possible profits. Thus a plot of sorts was hatched in order to coax the composer out of retirement to write another opera. Because of the importance of the dramatic aspects of opera to the composer, Verdi was especially selective in his choice of subjects. Consequently, if he were to agree to create another opera after a decade of retirement, the libretto would need to be one that would capture his interest.

During the period when a suitable story was being sought for what became &quot;Aida&quot;, Ricordi had come across Boito&#x27;s partly finished libretto of his own opera &quot;Nerone&quot;, and he even suggested in a letter of February 1870 to Verdi that, with Boito&#x27;s permission, he set it to music. Verdi ignored it, and so Ricordi tried again in January 1871, enclosing with his letter a copy of Boito&#x27;s libretto for Boito&#x27;s friend and collaborator Franco Faccio&#x27;s &quot;Amleto&quot; which had been given in 1865 and was revived in February 1871. Nothing came of this approach, although Ricordi persevered in various ways, as seen by the composer&#x27;s gruff response to the publisher&#x27;s statement &quot;The whole salvation of the theatre and the art is in your hands&quot; when Verdi wrote in April 1875 that &quot;I cannot take it as but a joke&quot;, continuing with &quot;Oh no, never fear, composers for the theatre will never be lacking&quot;.

Verdi&#x27;s refusals continued as the 1870s progressed. Knowing of his interest in the soprano Adelina Patti, Ricordi tried to entice him into writing an opera for her, but Verdi&#x27;s refusal resulted in another approach via a letter to the composer&#x27;s wife Giuseppina, who was to present the idea at an opportune time. But she confessed defeat yet again. Clara Maffei also tried, unsuccessfully, in March 1878 to interest Verdi, who replied: &quot;For what reason should I write? What would I succeed in doing?&quot;

While he was attempting to get Verdi involved a new opera, in May 1879 Ricordi also tried to engage the composer in revising &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot;. This suggestion, originally expressed ten years before but ignored, was once again shrugged off by Verdi, who sent a note saying that the 1857 score, which had been sent to the composer for review, would remain untouched &quot;just as you sent it to me&quot;.

Persisting with further attempts to convince the composer, Ricordi had also broached the idea of a collaboration with Boito for a new opera based on Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot;. Verdi admired the dramatic works of Shakespeare and had, throughout his career, desired to create operas based on his plays, although his one attempt at doing so, &quot;Macbeth&quot; in 1847, although initially successful, was not well received when revised for performance in Paris in 1865. Because of its relatively straightforward story, the play &quot;Othello&quot; was selected as a likely target.

Collaborations with Boito in the revision of the 1857 opera &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot; helped to convince Verdi of Boito&#x27;s ability as a librettist. Musicologist Roger Parker speculates that Verdi&#x27;s final agreement to revise &quot;Boccanegra&quot; was based on a desire to &quot;test the possibility&quot; of working with Boito before possibly embarking on the larger project. Frank Walker expresses much the same thoughts, noting that &quot;some of the results, such as the magnificent scene in the Council Chamber and the villainous Paolo&#x27;s Iago-like recitatives, foreshadow the later opera.&quot;

===Verdi is introduced to the idea of &quot;Otello&quot;===

Verdi visited Milan on 30 June 1879, and conducted his &quot;Requiem Mass&quot; in a benefit performance at La Scala. He received the great acclaim of the public, which included the La Scala orchestra playing outside his hotel. Walker assumes that it was both Ricordi and Faccio who stage managed the effects to give the composer the sense of being welcome and respected in Milan.

Finally, after some plotting, Ricordi, in conjunction with Verdi&#x27;s friend, the conductor Franco Faccio, subtly introduced the idea of a new opera to Verdi. During a dinner at Verdi&#x27;s Milan residence during the summer of 1879, Ricordi and Faccio guided the conversation towards Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Othello&quot; and to the librettist Arrigo Boito (whom Ricordi claimed to be a great fan of the play also). Ricordi told the story to Giuseppe Adami, a librettist for three of Puccini&#x27;s operas:
The idea of a new opera arose during a dinner among friends, when I turned the conversation, by chance, on Shakespeare and on Boito. At the mention of &quot;Othello&quot; I saw Verdi fix his eyes on me, with suspicion, but with interest. He had certainly understood; he had certainly reacted. I believed the time was ripe.

Suggestions were made, despite initial skepticism on the part of the composer, that Boito would be interested in creating a new libretto based upon the play. Within several days, Ricordi approached Verdi with the request that he would like to visit Sant&#x27; Agata &quot;with a friend&quot; in September. Verdi&#x27;s reaction was clearly non-committal: &quot;I wish absolutely to avoid committing myself [...] The best thing ... is for him to send me the finished poem&quot;.

Meanwhile, Boito began work on the libretto in spite of illness and, by late October/early November had sent a copy of the work so far. After appealing to Giuseppina, Ricordi was told that the Verdis would be coming to Milan and that he would meet privately with Boito. However, she noted in her letter of 7 November: &quot;Between ourselves, what Boito has so far written of the African seems to please him, and is very well done.&quot;

At this point the opera was being referred to as Iago rather than &quot;Otello&quot;, due to the tradition—&quot;an unwritten law of the theatre&quot;—that any new opera would have a new title rather than that of one still in the repertoire, in this case by Rossini.

===From libretto to first performance: 1879 to 1887===

The process of writing the first drafts of the libretto and the years of their revision, with Verdi all along not promising anything, dragged on. As Walker charts it, the opera was completed:
in three comparatively short bouts of composition: the first, very brief, was at Genoa in March 1884 [five years after the first drafts of the libretto began!]; the second, the principal one, at Genoa from December 1884 to April 1885; the third at Sant&#x27; Agata from the middle of September to early October 1885.

By late August 1881, it appears that the text of the finale of act 3, over which there had been some considerable discussion (with ideas exchanged between both men) was sent to Verdi, who responded in a long letter from Milan regarding his feelings about its overall structure, the role of the chorus, and other issues. Throughout 1882 and 1883 very little happened, although during the winter of 1883 Verdi and Boito met in Genoa where the Verdis spent their winters, but it prompted Ricordi for three Christmases in a row to send a cake to Verdi with the figure of the Moor—in chocolate—on the top. In order to keep information about the composition within the group, this gesture may have been the cause for the name given to the project for many years, &quot;chocolate&quot;, as in Boito&#x27;s letter of 1864 noting that &quot;the manufacture of chocolate was going ahead&quot;.

Early the following year, Verdi began to compose and on 20 March 1884, in a letter from Boito to Ricordi, the librettist announced that Verdi had begun with the &quot;opening of first act and seems to be working with fervor&quot;. There then occurred an event which unsettled both Verdi and Boito, and which nearly caused the project to come to a complete stop. While attending a banquet in Naples following the successful presentation of his opera &quot;Mefistofele&quot;, Boito gave an interview to a journalist and, in trying to keep information about the proposed &quot;Otello&quot; as quiet as possible, appears to have been misquoted by another journalist who overheard part of the conversation. The key point was that Boito, himself a composer, appeared to want to compose the music for &quot;Otello&quot; himself. When Verdi read this in a Milan newspaper, he was horrified and, in a letter to Faccio (rather than directly confronting Boito) stated that he wanted Faccio to directly tell the librettist that &quot;I will give him his manuscript intact, without a shadow of resentment, without rancor of any kind&quot;.

When he heard of the newspaper report, Boito was horrified. Writing immediately to Verdi, he states:
The theme and my libretto are yours by right of conquest. You alone can set &quot;Othello&quot; to music—all the dramatic creations you have given us proclaim the truth.
[He continues by discussing his own preoccupation with Emperor Nero and his love for the period of Ancient Roman history, pointing to his ongoing work on his own opera, &quot;Nerone&quot;]
... no other subject in the world can distract me, not even Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot;, could distract me from my theme.[He asks the composer, given the above comments, whether he really believes that he would accept his offer. Boito begs Verdi to not to abandon &quot;Otello&quot;:] It is predestined for you. Create it. You had begun work upon it [so..] take up you pen again and write me soon: &#x27;Dear Boito, do me the favour of altering these verses, etc. etc...&#x27;

Verdi&#x27;s response, which came right away was quite blunt: in addition to complaining of his age, his years of service, and raising other objections, he states: &quot;The conclusion is that all this has cast a chill over this &quot;Otello&quot;, and stiffened the hand that had begun to trace out a few bars!&quot;, but, in total contrast, Boito appears to have simply decided to carry on. Albeit &quot;somewhat disquieted&quot;, he immediately proposes &quot;a sort of &quot;evil Credo&quot; [which] I did... for my own comfort and personal satisfaction, because I felt the need of doing it&quot;. On 3 May, Verdi wrote back, calming this down: &quot;Most beautiful this Credo; most powerful and wholly Shakespearian... it would be well to leave this &quot;Otello&quot; in peace for a bit ... [and encouraging Boito to come to Sant&#x27;Agata where] &quot;we shall be able to talk it over again, and by then with the necessary calm&quot;. Boito did visit Verdi in September for three days.

&quot;It seems impossible, but it&#x27;s true all the same! I&#x27;m busy, writing!! ... without purpose, without worries, without thinking of what will happen next...&quot; So Verdi wrote to Boito, with a request for a few more lines for act two, to which the librettist immediately responded: &quot;One can&#x27;t escape one&#x27;s destiny, and by a law of intellectual affinity that tragedy of Shakespeare&#x27;s is predestined for you&quot;.

Verdi&#x27;s second burst of creative energy lasted until mid-April 1885, and was followed by the usual summer break and a lack of any activity. He confesses to Boito in a letter of 10 September of that year, when he invites him to come to Sant&#x27;Agata the following Sunday, stating &quot;since I&#x27;ve been here [from the end of April] (I blush to say it) I&#x27;ve done nothing!&quot; It was during this time that the fourth act was pulled together. Walker speculates that Boito&#x27;s visit and his conversations with the composer must have had some effect on Verdi because, on 5 October, Verdi made the announcement: &quot;I have finished the fourth act, and I breathe again&quot;.

Scoring took another year which, from January 1886 onward, involved the librettist in re-writes and additions at Verdi&#x27;s request. It was at this time that it was decided to call the opera &quot;Otello&quot; rather than &quot;Iago&quot; (as noted above). Verdi&#x27;s letter to Boito in January settles the matter: &quot;I would find it hypocritical not to call it &quot;Otello&quot;. Emanuele Muzio (Verdi&#x27;s long-time assistant) tells Ricordi in March that the love duet in act 1 was finished and performed.

In May, Verdi &quot;hit upon the precise form of one of the most famous entrances in all opera&quot; – Otello&#x27;s &quot;Esultate&quot; – in act 1. Boito modified his verses accordingly. Other minor changes and proposed revisions were wrapped up into September so that Verdi could write to Ricordi on 9 September: &quot;Tomorrow I shall send to Casa Ricordi, completely finished, all the first act and all scene &quot;vi&quot; of the third; and thus with the fourth, already sent, perhaps three-fifths of the Moor are ready&quot;.

But on 1 November 1886, in a laconic communication, Verdi was able to proclaim: &quot;DEAR BOITO, It is finished! All honour to us! (and to &quot;Him&quot;!!). Farewell. G. VERDI&quot;.(&quot;sic&quot;) This left only a few minor tweaks to be done, with Boito providing two more lines in December and Verdi writing to him on the 18th saying &quot;I have just consigned to [Ricordi] the last acts of &quot;Otello&quot;! Poor Othello!... He won&#x27;t come back here any more!!!&quot; The librettist replied: &quot;The Moor will come back no more to knock on the door of the Palazzo Doria [Verdi&#x27;s Genoa residence], but you will go to meet the Moor at La Scala. &quot;Otello&quot; exists. The great dream has become reality&quot;.

==Performance history==
===Premiere===
As the Italian public became aware that the retired Verdi was composing another opera, rumors about it abounded. At the same time, many of the most illustrious conductors, singers and opera-house managers in Europe were vying for an opportunity to play a part in &quot;Otello&quot;″s premiere, despite the fact that Faccio and La Scala, Milan, had already been selected as the conductor and the venue for the first performance. The two male protagonists had been selected, too: Italy&#x27;s foremost dramatic tenor, Francesco Tamagno, was to sing Otello while the esteemed French singing-actor Victor Maurel would assume the villainous baritone role of Iago. Romilda Pantaleoni, a well-known singing-actress, was assigned Desdemona&#x27;s soprano part.

Upon the completion of the opera, preparations for the initial performance were conducted in absolute secrecy and Verdi reserved the right to cancel the premiere up to the last minute. In particular, the composer expressed reservations about Tamagno&#x27;s softer singing, though not about the power and ring of his vocalism in dramatic passages of the score.

Verdi need not have worried: &quot;Otello&quot;″s debut proved to be a resounding success. The audience&#x27;s enthusiasm for Verdi was shown by the 20 curtain calls that he took at the end of the opera. Further stagings of &quot;Otello&quot; soon followed at leading theatres throughout Europe and America.

===Subsequent productions===
The opera was first seen in the US at the Academy of Music in New York on 16 April 1888 and in the UK on 5 July 1889 in London. At its first appearance in Vienna (14 March 1888), the title role was sung by Hermann Winkelmann, who had created the title role in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Parsifal&quot; at Bayreuth in 1882.

&quot;Otello&quot; was given its Paris premiere by the Opéra at the Palais Garnier on 12 October 1894 with Albert Saléza in the title role, Rose Caron as Desdemona, and Paul Taffanel conducting. It was performed in a French translation by Arrigo Boito and Camille Du Locle. Verdi composed a short ballet for the finale of Act 3 (ceremony of welcome for the Venetian ambassadors). The production was directed by Alexandre Lapissida, the costumes were designed by Charles Bianchini, and the sets, by Marcel Jambon (Act I); and Eugène Gardy (Act II); Eugène Carpezat (Act III); and Auguste Alfred Rubé and Philippe Chaperon (Act IV).

Today, the opera is frequently performed throughout the world, a staple of the standard repertoire.

===Roles, their demands, and the singers who met them===
Since the three leading roles of the opera (Otello, Desdemona and Iago) are among Verdi&#x27;s most demanding, both vocally and dramatically, some of the most illustrious singers of the past 130 years have made &quot;Otello&quot; part of their repertoire. Famous Otellos of the past have included Tamagno, the role&#x27;s trumpet-voiced creator, as well as Giovanni Battista De Negri, Albert Alvarez, Francesc Viñas, Giuseppe Borgatti, Antonio Paoli, Giovanni Zenatello, Renato Zanelli, Giovanni Martinelli, Aureliano Pertile, Francesco Merli, Giacomo Lauri-Volpi, Frank Mullings, Leo Slezak, Jose Luccioni, Ramón Vinay, Mario Del Monaco, James McCracken, Jon Vickers, David Rendall, Jeffrey Lawton and Carlo Cossutta. Pre-Second World War Wagnerian tenors such as Jacques Urlus, Heinrich Knote, Alexander Kirchner, Lauritz Melchior and Franz Völker also undertook the part (usually singing it in German). The Russian heroic tenor Ivan Yershov was a renowned pre-World War I Otello in his native country. His compatriot Arnold Azrikan achieved his greatest recognition as a dramatic tenor in Otello. For this performance he was awarded the Stalin Prize in 1946.
Enrico Caruso was studying &quot;Otello&quot; when he died unexpectedly in 1921, thus thwarting the New York Metropolitan Opera company&#x27;s plans to stage the opera as a new vehicle for its star tenor.

Currently, Plácido Domingo has appeared in more video productions of the opera than any other tenor. Also, he has recorded the complete role several times on CD and appeared in numerous stage productions of the work on both sides of the Atlantic. In his book &quot;My First Forty Years&quot;, Domingo has written about different approaches over the years towards singing the role of Otello:
As to the other question — that of singing roles that, according to self-proclaimed experts, we ought not to be singing — I have a little story to tell. When I decided to sing Otello, many people told me that I was crazy. Mario Del Monaco, they said, had had the proper kind of voice for the role, and my voice was nothing like his. Twenty years earlier, Del Monaco had been warned not to sing Otello because his voice was nothing like that of Ramon Vinay, who was then performing the opera all over the world. Vinay, of course, had heard that only a tenor with a piercing sound like Giovanni Martinelli&#x27;s ought to sing the part. Some years earlier, Martinelli had had Antonin Trantoul, who had sung Otello at La Scala in the twenties, held up to him as a shining example; but at La Scala, those who still remembered the very first Otello, Francesco Tamagno, had found Trantoul completely unsatisfactory. But there exists a letter from Verdi to his publisher in which the composer makes it quite clear that Tamagno left a great deal to be desired.

A long lineage of renowned baritones have sung Iago since 1887. Among them: Victor Maurel (the role&#x27;s first exponent), Mattia Battistini, Mario Ancona, Antonio Scotti, Titta Ruffo, Pasquale Amato, Carlo Galeffi and Lawrence Tibbett. Leading post-war exponents of the part have included Giuseppe Valdengo, Leonard Warren, Robert Merrill, Tito Gobbi, Sherrill Milnes, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and James Morris. Many lyric sopranos have also sung the role of Desdemona since 1887, including Renata Tebaldi (1954), Leonie Rysanek (1960), Gwyneth Jones (1968), Mirella Freni (1974), Kiri Te Kanawa (1974), Margaret Price (1977), Renata Scotto (1978), Katia Ricciarelli (1985), Cheryl Studer (1993), Renée Fleming (1996) and Sonya Yoncheva (2015).

===Blackface controversy===
For many years it was common for white singers to wear dark makeup when playing Otello. The Metropolitan Opera stopped the practice in 2015. Some have argued that using dark makeup for the character is a matter of costuming, and not a true example of racist blackface. The Metropolitan decision led to calls for casting more people of color in opera.

==Roles==

==Synopsis==
: Time: The late 16th century.
: Place: A coastal city on the island of Cyprus.

=== Act 1 ===
&quot;A town in Cyprus, outside the castle. An inn with a pergola, in the background the quayside and sea. It is evening. Lightning, thunder, gale force winds.&quot;

On a stormy evening, the people of Cyprus anxiously await the arrival of the new governor, Otello, from a naval battle with the Turks (Chorus, Montano, Cassio, Iago, Roderigo: &quot;Una vela!&quot; / &quot;A sail!&quot;). For a moment it seems as if Otello&#x27;s ship will founder, to the delight of Otello&#x27;s treacherous ensign, Iago, but Otello arrives safely and announces that the Turkish fleet has been destroyed, and the Cypriots cheer (Otello, chorus: &quot;Esultate! L&#x27;orgoglio musulmano sepolto è in mar&quot; / &quot;Rejoice! The Muslim’s pride is buried in the sea&quot;).

Iago offers to help the young Venetian gentleman Roderigo in his seduction of Otello&#x27;s wife, Desdemona – Iago envies Otello his success and longs to destroy the Moor (Iago, Roderigo: &quot;Roderigo, ebben che pensi?&quot; / &quot;Well, Roderigo, what are you thinking?&quot;). Among his grievances, Iago is outraged that Otello has appointed Cassio to be the captain of the navy, a position that Iago hoped to have. The people of Cyprus celebrate the safe return of Otello and his men by lighting a bonfire and drinking (Chorus: &quot;Fuoco di gioia!&quot;/ &quot;Fire of joy&quot;).

Iago proposes a toast to Otello and his wife, while Cassio praises Desdemona (Iago, Cassio, Chorus, Roderigo: &quot;Roderigo, beviam!&quot; / &quot;Roderigo, let&#x27;s drink!&quot;). Iago offers Cassio more wine, but Cassio says he has had enough. Iago pressures him and offers a toast to Otello and Desdemona. Cassio gives in. Iago sings a drinking song and continues to pour Cassio wine (Iago, Cassio, Roderigo, chorus: &quot;Inaffia l&#x27;ugola!&quot; / &quot;Wet your throat&quot;).

Montano enters and calls for Cassio to begin his watch; he is surprised to find Cassio drunk and barely able to stand upright. Iago lies to Montano, telling him that this is how Cassio spends every evening. Roderigo laughs at Cassio&#x27;s drunkenness and Cassio attacks him. Montano tells Cassio to calm down, but Cassio draws his sword and threatens to crack open Montano&#x27;s head. (Montano, Cassio, Iago, Roderigo, chorus: &quot;Capitano, v&#x27;attende la fazione ai baluardi&quot; / &quot;Captain, the guard awaits you on the ramparts&quot;.) Cassio and Montano begin to duel, and Iago sends Roderigo to call the alarm. Montano is wounded and the fight is stopped only by the appearance of Otello.

Otello orders Montano and Cassio to lower their swords. He then asks &quot;honest Iago&quot; to explain how the duel began, but Iago says he doesn&#x27;t know. Otello then turns to Cassio, who is embarrassed and cannot excuse his actions. When Otello discovers that Montano is wounded, he becomes enraged. Desdemona enters, and, upon seeing that his bride&#x27;s rest has been disturbed, Otello declares that Cassio is no longer Captain. (Otello, Iago, Cassio, Montano: &quot;Abbasso le spade&quot; / &quot;Down with your swords&quot;.) He tells Iago to patrol the town to restore quiet, calls for help for Montano and orders everyone to return to their houses.

The Cypriots leave Otello alone with Desdemona. Together Otello and Desdemona recall why they fell in love. Otello, in an ecstasy of joy, invites death, fearing that he will never know such happiness again. Desdemona prays that their love will remain unchanged. They kiss, overcome with love for each other. (Otello, Desdemona: &quot;Già nella notte densa s&#x27;estingue ogni clamor&quot; /&quot;Now in the dark night all noise is silenced&quot;.)

=== Act 2 ===
&quot;A hall on the ground floor of the castle, divided by a glass partition from the garden at the back, with a balcony.&quot;

Iago suggests to Cassio that he should ask Desdemona to talk to Otello about his demotion; Desdemona can influence her husband to reinstate him (Iago, Cassio: &quot;Non ti crucciar&quot; / &quot;Do not fret&quot;). Desdemona and Emilia can be seen walking the garden. Cassio approaches Desdemona. Watching from the room, Iago voices his nihilistic beliefs and hatred of humankind (&quot;Credo in un Dio crudel&quot; / &quot;I believe in a cruel God&quot;).

Otello enters the room; Iago, pretending not to notice him, says that he is deeply troubled. Cassio sees Otello from afar and goes discreetly away. Otello asks what&#x27;s wrong, but Iago gives only vague answers. Finally, he hints that Cassio and Desdemona are having an affair. Otello begins to get suspicious, but declares that he needs proof before believing that Desdemona has been unfaithful. (Iago, Otello: &quot;Ciò m&#x27;accora... Che parli?&quot; / &quot;That worries me...&quot; &quot;What did you say?&quot;) Iago warns Otello against jealousy, but also advises him to be vigilant.

A crowd of children, sailors, and Cypriots sing to Desdemona, praising her beauty and purity (Chorus, Iago, children, Desdemona, Otello: &quot;Dove guardi splendono raggi&quot; / &quot;Wherever you look, brightness shines...&quot;). They present her with gifts and wish her happiness before leaving.

Desdemona carries Cassio&#x27;s request for reinstatement to Otello. Otello sourly tells her to ask him another time; as she persists, he grows impatient and says he has a headache. Desdemona offers to wrap his head in a handkerchief Otello once gave her, linen embroidered with strawberries. Otello throws it to the ground and says he doesn&#x27;t need it (Desdemona, Otello: &quot;D&#x27;un uom che geme sotto il tuo disdegno la preghiera ti porto&quot; / &quot;I bring a petition from one who suffers under your displeasure&quot;). Emilia picks up the handkerchief. Desdemona asks for Otello&#x27;s forgiveness. Aside, Iago demands that Emilia give him the handkerchief. When she refuses, Iago forcibly takes it from her.

Otello dismisses the others, and declares that he now believes that Desdemona may be deceiving him (Otello: &quot;Ora e per sempre addio sante memorie&quot; / &quot;Now and forever farewell, holy memories&quot;). Iago returns, and the jealous Otello demands proof of Desdemona&#x27;s infidelity. Iago says that once, when he and Cassio were sleeping in the same room, he heard Cassio talking to Desdemona in a dream. In the dream, says Iago, Cassio told Desdemona that they must be careful to conceal their love. (Iago: &quot;Era la notte, Cassio dormia&quot; / &quot;It was night, Cassio was sleeping&quot;.) Iago says that dreams don&#x27;t prove anything, but remarks that he saw Cassio carrying Desdemona&#x27;s strawberry-embroidered handkerchief just the day before. Otello swears vengeance on Desdemona and Cassio, and Iago joins him in his vow (Otello, Iago: &quot;Sì, pel ciel marmoreo giuro&quot; / &quot;Yes, by the marble heavens I swear&quot;).

=== Act 3 ===
&quot;The great hall of the castle. To the right, a large colonnade leading to a smaller hall, in the back of which is a balcony. Otello and Iago talking in the hall as a herald enters.&quot;

A herald brings news of the approach of ambassadors from Venice. Iago explains to Otello that he will lure Cassio here and talk with him while Otello watches, hidden. He leaves to go get Cassio. (Iago: &quot;Qui trarrò Cassio&quot; / &quot;Here I will bring Cassio&quot;.)

Desdemona enters and reminds Otello of Cassio&#x27;s request. Otello says that his headache has returned, and asks Desdemona to wrap her handkerchief around his head. When Desdemona produces a different handkerchief, Otello demands the one with strawberries. When she says she does not have it, Otello says that it was a talisman, and troubles will befall her if she loses it. Desdemona says that he is trying to ignore Cassio&#x27;s plea, and as she asks him about Cassio, he demands the handkerchief ever more insistently. (Desdemona, Otello: &quot;Dio ti giocondi, o sposo&quot; / &quot;God keep you merry, husband&quot;.) Desdemona protests that she is faithful; Otello sends her away (Desdemona, Otello: &quot;Esterrefatta fisso lo sguardo tuo tremendo&quot; / &quot;Terrified, I face your dreadful look&quot;).

Otello laments his fate (&quot;Dio! mi potevi scagliar tutti i mali&quot; / &quot;God, you could have thrown every evil at me&quot; ). When Iago calls out &quot;Cassio is here!&quot; Otello hides as Iago and Cassio enter. Cassio says he had hoped to see Desdemona here, for he wanted to know whether she had been successful with Otello (Iago, Cassio, Otello: &quot;Vieni; l&#x27;aula è deserta&quot; / &quot;Come, the hall is deserted&quot;). Iago asks him to tell of his adventures with that woman. Cassio asks which woman, and, softly, so that Otello cannot hear, Iago says &quot;Bianca&quot; (the name of Cassio&#x27;s actual lover). As Cassio laughs about his romantic adventures, Otello assumes he is speaking of Desdemona. In a conversation only partially heard, Cassio seems to be telling Iago that another woman, a secret admirer, left him a handkerchief as a token. At Iago&#x27;s urging, Cassio produces it, whereupon Iago seizes it—for it is Desdemona&#x27;s—and holds it out where he knows Otello can see it. He then returns it to Cassio and teases him, while in his hiding place Otello fumes (Iago, Cassio, Otello: &quot;Questa è una ragna dove il tuo cuor casca&quot; / &quot;This is a spiderweb in which your heart is caught&quot;).

Bugles sound, announcing the arrival of the Venetian ambassador, Lodovico. Iago warns Cassio that he should leave unless he wants to see Otello. Cassio exits, and Otello asks Iago how he should kill his wife. Iago advises Otello to kill Desdemona by suffocating her in her bed, while he will take care of Cassio. Otello promotes Iago to Captain.

Lodovico, Desdemona, Emilia, Roderigo, and other dignitaries enter. When Lodovico notes Cassio&#x27;s absence, Iago tells him that Cassio is out of favor. Desdemona interrupts, telling Lodovico that she hopes he will soon be restored. Otello calls her a demon and almost strikes her violently but is held back by Lodovico. Otello then calls for Cassio. (Lodovico, Otello, Desdemona, Emilia, Iago, chorus: &quot;Il Doge ed il Senato salutano l&#x27;eroe trionfatore&quot; / &quot;The Doge and the Senate greet the triumphant hero&quot;.) Cassio enters and Otello reads (mixing in insults to Desdemona) a letter from the Doge, announcing that he (Otello) has been called back to Venice and Cassio is to succeed him as governor of Cyprus. Enraged, Otello throws Desdemona to the ground. (Otello, Roderigo, Iago, Cassio, Lodovico: &quot;Messeri! il Doge mi richiama a Venezia&quot; / &quot;Gentlemen! The Doge recalls me to Venice&quot;.)

Desdemona, on the ground, laments (&quot;A terra! … sì … nel livido fango&quot; / &quot;Fallen! yes, in the foul mud...&quot;). The various characters express their feelings: Emilia and Lodovico express their sympathy for Desdemona, Cassio marvels at his sudden change of fortune, and Roderigo laments that Desdemona will soon depart. In separate asides, Iago urges Otello to take his revenge as soon as possible, while he will take care of Cassio. He advises Roderigo that the only way to prevent Desdemona from leaving is for Cassio, the new Duke, to die, and suggests that Roderigo murder Cassio that night. (Emilia, Cassio, Desdemona, Roderigo, Lodovico, Iago, Otello, chorus: &quot;Quell&#x27;innocente un fremito d&#x27;odio non ha nè un gesto&quot; / &quot;That innocent one is without feeling or gesture of hatred&quot;). In a fury, Otello orders everyone to leave. Desdemona goes to comfort him, but Lodovico pulls her away as Otello curses her. As the others leave, Otello raves about the handkerchief, then collapses. Outside, the crowd of Cypriots hails the victory and glory for Otello, whom they call &quot;the Lion of Venice&quot;. Iago presses Otello&#x27;s forehead with his heel, and snarls, with contemptuous irony: &quot;&quot;Ecco il Leone!&quot; (&quot;This is the lion!&quot;), and then walks away. (Otello, Desdemona, Emilia, Cassio, Roderigo, Lodovico, Iago, chorus: &quot;Fuggite!&quot; / &quot;Begone&quot;.)

=== Act 4 ===
&quot;Desdemona&#x27;s bedchamber. A bed, a prie-dieu, a table, a mirror, some chairs. A light burns in front of an image of the Madonna which hangs above the prie-dieu. To the right is a door. On the table a light. It is night. &quot;

Desdemona is preparing for bed with the assistance of Emilia. She asks Emilia to put out the bridal gown she used on her wedding day, and says that if she dies, she wants to be buried in it. Emilia tells her not to talk about such things. Desdemona recalls how her mother&#x27;s servant Barbara was abandoned by her lover, and how she used to sing the Willow Song (Desdemona: &quot;Piangea cantando nell&#x27;erma landa&quot; / &quot;Singing, she wept on the lonely hearth&quot;). After Emilia leaves, Desdemona prays (&quot;Ave Maria&quot;) and then falls asleep.

Silently, Otello enters, with a sword. He kisses his wife three times; she awakens. Otello asks her if she has prayed tonight; she must die, and he does not wish to condemn her soul. She asks God for mercy, both for her and for Otello. Otello accuses her of sin, saying that he must kill her because she loves Cassio. Desdemona denies it and asks that he summon Cassio to testify to her innocence. Otello says that Cassio is already dead. Desdemona, horrified, pleads for mercy, but Otello tells her it&#x27;s too late and strangles her (Otello, Desdemona: &quot;Diceste questa sera le vostre preci&quot; / &quot;Have you said your prayers tonight?&quot;).

Emilia knocks at the door, (Emilia: &quot;Aprite! Aprite!&quot; / &quot;Open up!&quot;) announcing that Cassio has killed Roderigo. Desdemona softly calls out that she has been unjustly accused, but refuses to blame Otello. She dies. Emilia calls Otello a murderer; he retorts that Iago gave him proof of Desdemona&#x27;s infidelity. Otello begins to threaten Emilia, who calls for help. Iago, Cassio, and Lodovico enter. Emilia demands that Iago deny Otello&#x27;s accusation; he refuses. Otello says that the handkerchief Desdemona gave to Cassio is proof enough. Emilia, horrified, explains that Iago stole the handkerchief from her—Cassio confirms that the handkerchief appeared mysteriously in his lodgings. Montano enters and says that Roderigo, with his dying breath, has revealed Iago&#x27;s plot. Iago, brandishing his sword, runs away.

After he realizes what has happened, Otello grieves over Desdemona&#x27;s death. Initially he draws his scimitar (Otello: &quot;Niun mi tema&quot; / &quot;That none fear me&quot;) but then relinquishes it. He then stealthily draws a dagger from his robe (Otello: &quot;Ho un&#x27;arma ancor!&quot; / I still have another weapon!) and stabs himself. Others try to stop him, but it is too late. Before he dies, he drags himself next to his wife and kisses her (Otello: &quot;Un bacio...un bacio ancora...ah!...un altro bacio...&quot; / A kiss.. another kiss...ah...and yet another kiss). He lies dead next to Desdemona.

<text>Vanguard 1 (Harvard designation: 1958-Beta 2, COSPAR ID: 1958-002B) is an American satellite that was the fourth artificial Earth-orbiting satellite to be successfully launched, following Sputnik 1, Sputnik 2, and Explorer 1. It was launched 17 March 1958. Vanguard 1 was the first satellite to have solar electric power. Although communications with the satellite were lost in 1964, it remains the oldest human-made object still in orbit, together with the upper stage of its launch vehicle.

Vanguard 1 was designed to test the launch capabilities of a three-stage launch vehicle as a part of Project Vanguard, and the effects of the space environment on a satellite and its systems in Earth orbit. It also was used to obtain geodetic measurements through orbit analysis. Vanguard 1, being small and light enough to carry with one hand, was described by the Soviet Premier, Nikita Khrushchev, as &quot;the grapefruit satellite&quot;.

== Spacecraft design ==
The spacecraft is a aluminum sphere in diameter, with antennae spanning . It contains a 10 mW, 108 MHz transmitter powered by a mercury battery and a 5 mW, 108.03 MHz transmitter that was powered by six solar cells mounted on the body of the satellite. Six long antennas, diameter spring-actuated aluminum alloy aerials protrude from the sphere. The transmitters were used primarily for engineering and tracking data, but were also used to determine the total electron content between the satellite and the ground stations.

A backup version of Vanguard 1 is on display at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia.

== Mission ==
On 17 March 1958, the three-stage launch vehicle placed Vanguard into a , 134.27-minute elliptical orbit inclined at 34.25°. Original estimates had the orbit lasting for 2,000 years, but it was discovered that solar radiation pressure and atmospheric drag during high levels of solar activity produced significant perturbations in the perigee height of the satellite, which caused a significant decrease in its expected lifetime to about 240 years. Vanguard 1 transmitted its signals for over six years as it orbited the Earth.

=== Radio beacon ===
A 10 mW mercury-battery-powered telemetry transmitter on the 108 MHz band used for International Geophysical Year (IGY) scientific satellites, and a 5 mW, 108.03 MHz Minitrack transmitter powered by six solar cells were used as part of a radio phase-comparison angle-tracking system. The system transmitted signals through the satellite&#x27;s six spring-loaded aluminum alloy aerials. Satellite tracking was achieved using these transmitters and Minitrack ground stations situated around the globe.

These radio signals were used to determine the total electron content between the satellite and selected ground-receiving stations. The battery-powered transmitter provided internal package temperature for about 16 days and sent tracking signals for 20 days. The solar-cell-powered transmitter operated for more than six years. Signals gradually weakened and were last received at the Minitrack station in Quito, Ecuador, in May 1964. Since then the spacecraft has been tracked optically from Earth, via telescope.

=== Design for atmospheric density measurements ===
Because of its symmetrical shape, Vanguard 1 was used by experimenters for determining upper atmospheric densities as a function of altitude, latitude, season, and solar activity. As the satellite continuously orbited, it would deviate from its predicted positions slightly, accumulating greater and greater shift due to drag of the residual atmosphere. By measuring the rate and timing of orbital shifts, together with the body&#x27;s drag properties, the relevant atmosphere&#x27;s parameters could be back-calculated. It was determined that atmospheric pressures, and thus drag and orbital decay, were higher than anticipated, since Earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere does taper off into space gradually.

This experiment was planned extensively prior to launch. Initial Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) proposals for the project included conical satellite bodies; this eliminated the need for a separate fairing and ejection mechanisms, and their associated weight and failure modes. Radio-tracking would gather data and establish a position. Early in the program, optical tracking (with a Baker-Nunn camera network and human spotters) was added. A panel of scientists proposed changing the design to spheres, at least in diameter and hopefully . 

A sphere would have a constant optical reflection, and constant coefficient of drag, based on size alone, while a cone would have properties that varied with its orientation. James Van Allen of the University of Iowa proposed a cylindrical satellite based on his work with rockoons, which became Explorer 1, the first American satellite. The Naval Research Laboratory finally accepted a sphere with a of diameter as a &quot;Test Vehicle&quot;, with a diameter of set for the follow-on satellites. The weight savings, from reduced size as well as decreased instrumentation in the early satellites, was considered to be acceptable.

As Vanguard 1, Vanguard 2, and Vanguard 3 are still orbiting with their drag properties essentially unchanged, they form a baseline data set on the atmosphere of Earth that is over 60 years old and continuing.

== After the mission ==
After its scientific mission ended in 1964, Vanguard 1 became a derelict object – as did the upper stage of the launch rocket, after it finished the delta-v maneuver to place Vanguard 1 in orbit in 1958. Both objects remain in orbit. Vanguard 1 was projected to remain aloft for up to 2,000 years, but solar radiation pressure and atmospheric drag perturbations during periods of high solar activity affected its perigee, reducing its lifetime, and now it is expected to burn up in the atmosphere in about 240 years, sometime in the late 22nd century. As space travel becomes routine, and especially when its re-entry date draws near, some have suggested that the satellite might be retrieved as a valued artifact of early space exploration.

=== 50th anniversary ===
The Vanguard 1 satellite and upper launch stage hold the record for being in space longer than any other human-made object, and as such have traveled farther over the Earth&#x27;s surface than any other human-made object.

A small group of former NRL and NASA workers had been in communication with one another, and a number of government agencies were asked to commemorate the event. The Naval Research Laboratory commemorated the event with a day-long meeting at NRL on 17 March 2008. The meeting concluded with a simulation of the satellite&#x27;s track as it passed into the orbital area visible from Washington, D.C., (where it is visible from the Earth&#x27;s surface). The National Academy of Sciences scheduled seminars to mark the 50th anniversary of the International Geophysical Year.

<text>Wilfred &quot;Wilfredo&quot; Benítez (born September 12, 1958) is an American-born Puerto Rican former professional boxer and the youngest world champion in the sport&#x27;s history. Earning his first of three career world titles in separate weight divisions at the age of seventeen, he is best remembered as a skilled and aggressive fighter with exceptional defensive abilities, along with his fights with Roberto Durán, Thomas Hearns, and Sugar Ray Leonard.

Inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1996, he is considered among the best Puerto Rican boxers of all time, sharing the honor with Félix Trinidad, Wilfredo Gómez, Carlos Ortiz, Héctor Camacho, Edwin Rosario and Miguel Cotto.

==Early history==
Benítez turned pro at 15, a young prodigy who was managed by his father Gregorio Benítez, was a member of one of Puerto Rico&#x27;s boxing families. His brothers Frankie and Gregory Benítez having also been top contenders in the 1970s. The Benítez troop was largely directed by their mother, Clara Benítez. Young Wilfred was nicknamed &quot;The Radar&quot; for his uncanny ability to foresee and dodge his opponent&#x27;s blows. He grew up going to a neighborhood boxing gym in New York, where he learned from watching his brothers and other local, renowned fighters practice their skills.

During the early stages of his professional career, Benítez often traveled to the Netherlands Antilles and New York City for fights. He divided his fights between those locations and Puerto Rico. The proximity of those two locations to Puerto Rico helped him start to become a household name in the island while building an international following at the same time. His speed, combined with punching power and surprising ring maturity for a 16-year-old, were enough to make him a world-ranked boxer by both the WBA and WBC, then boxing&#x27;s only world-title recognizing organizations.

==Professional boxing career==
On March 6, 1976, at age 17, with his high school classmates in attendance, he faced Lineal and WBA Light Welterweight champion Antonio Cervantes. Known as Kid Pambele, the champion was 30 years old, had a record of 74-9-3 with 35 KO&#x27;s, and had made 10 title defenses. The result was a fifteen-round split decision in Benítez&#x27;s favor. Benítez retained the championship three times, and then moved up to the welterweight division.

=== Moving up ===
Benítez challenged Lineal and WBC World Champion Carlos Palomino in San Juan. On January 14, 1979, Benítez won a fifteen-round split decision to become a world champion in a second weight division. Referee Zach Clayton scored the fight 145-142 in Palomino&#x27;s favor, but judges Jay Edson and Harry Gibbs disagreed. Edson scored the bout 146-142 for Benítez. Gibbs also scored for Benítez, 146-142. After outpointing Harold Weston Jr. in his first defense (avenging an earlier draw), Benítez fought Sugar Ray Leonard in Las Vegas, Nevada on November 30, 1979.

=== Fighting Sugar Ray Leonard ===

It was a scientific fight by both fighters, who demonstrated their defensive skills throughout the bout. Benítez suffered a third-round knockdown and a cut on his forehead, which was opened by an accidental head butt in round six. Leonard put Benítez down again in the fifteenth round and the referee stopped the fight with six seconds left in round fifteen. Leonard was ahead on all cards at the time of the stoppage. The scores were 137–133, 137–130 and 136–134, all for Leonard.

=== Moving up again ===

After that loss, Benítez again moved up in weight, and on May 23, 1981, at age 22, he became the youngest three-time world champion in boxing history by knocking out WBC World Super Welterweight Champion Maurice Hope in twelve rounds in Las Vegas. The knockout was named one of the knockouts of the year.

His next fight became a historic bout. On November 14, 1981, he fought future world champ Carlos Santos of Ceiba, Puerto Rico. It was the first world championship fight between two Puerto Ricans in boxing history. It was fought 3,000 miles away from Puerto Rico, at Caesar&#x27;s Palace in Las Vegas. Benítez won a fifteen-round unanimous decision. His next defense was against Roberto Durán, whom Benítez defeated at Caesar&#x27;s Palace on January 30, 1982 by a fifteen-round unanimous decision. On December 3, 1982, at the Carnival of Champions in New Orleans, Benítez lost the belt to another boxing legend, Thomas Hearns, by a fifteen-round majority decision.

===Career decline===
Benítez&#x27;s career went downwards after the fight with Hearns, as did his lifestyle. In 1983, he lost a unanimous decision to Mustafa Hamsho. In 1984, he tried a comeback under the hand of Yamil Chade, but this proved unsuccessful as he was knocked out in the second round by Davey Moore. On November 28, 1986, with his health declining, Benítez went to Salta, Argentina to fight against middleweight Carlos Herrera. Benítez was stopped in seven rounds. But to make matters worse, his money for the fight was stolen by the promoter, along with his documents and passport, and he was stranded in Argentina for over a year. After eventually being tracked down, and after much government huddling and talks, he was finally able to fly back home to Puerto Rico in 1988.

In 1990, with his health in increasingly worse shape, Benítez moved to Tucson, Arizona, where he tried another comeback under the tutelage of Emanuel Steward, the Kronk trainer. This also proved unsuccessful, as he went 2-2 in his last four fights. His last bout took place in Winnipeg, Canada on September 18, 1990, six days after his 32nd birthday. He lost a ten-round decision against Scott Papasadora.

* &quot;The Ring&quot; welterweight champion (147 lbs)

==Retirement and illness==
After retiring from boxing in late 1990, Benítez returned to Puerto Rico, where he lived with his mother Clara on a $200 a month pension provided by the World Boxing Council. Since 1989, Benítez has suffered from an incurable, degenerative brain condition caused by the blows that he took in the ring.

In 1997, Benítez was moved to a public nursing home for medical reasons by his mother Clara, a licensed nurse.

In 2002, Sugar Ray Leonard visited Benítez, who by this time had forgotten his identity. During the visit, their fight was shown on television. Consequently, Benítez remembered the event and said to Leonard, &quot;Ray, I did not train for that fight.&quot;

In 2004, Benítez was diagnosed with diabetes, adding further complications to his worsening health. When his mother died in the summer of 2008, his sister Yvonne Benítez, took over his care.

In 2018, after Hurricane Maria destroyed his home and made it difficult for Benítez to receive therapy, an old friend and boxing mate, Luis Mateo, helped Benítez and his sister move to Chicago. It was their hope that in Chicago, Benítez would receive better health care.

==Support, recovery and public appearance==
Ring 10, a non-profit organization that helps impoverished former fighters, provides a monthly stipend to Benítez and established &quot;The Wilfred Benítez Fund&quot; to raise more money to aid the fallen champion.

During 2012, Benítez was honored with a statue in Puerto Rico.

On November 27, 2012, a smiling and healthy looking Benítez attended the funeral of Hector Camacho in Puerto Rico, arriving in a wheelchair. Benítez arrived accompanied by boxers Félix Trinidad, Wilfredo Gómez, and Alfredo Escalera. Surprising the mourners, Benítez rose to his feet for a boxing pose in front of Camacho&#x27;s coffin.

With the emotional and financial assistance of former Benitez sparring partner Luis Mateo and Chicago&#x27;s Puerto Rican community, on June 1, 2018, in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, Wilfred Benitez, age 59, and his sister Yvonne Benitez, arrived in Chicago, Illinois, where he spent the first week in the hospital, then was moved to an apartment on Chicago&#x27;s West Side. Donations from the Chicago Puerto Rican community helped pay for the plane tickets, and continue ongoing to provide expense money for the apartment, food, and other necessities, according to Mateo and Yvonne Benitez. Wilfred appears in overall better health, good spirits, has gained weight, tries to talk, and is more alert since his arrival in the mainland United States.

<text>Pioneer 4 was an American spin-stabilized uncrewed spacecraft launched as part of the Pioneer program on a lunar flyby trajectory and into a heliocentric orbit making it the first probe of the United States to escape from the Earth&#x27;s gravity. Launched on March 3, 1959, it carried a payload similar to &quot;Pioneer 3&quot;: a lunar radiation environment experiment using a Geiger–Müller tube detector and a lunar photography experiment. It passed within of the Moon&#x27;s surface. However, &quot;Pioneer 4&quot; did not come close enough to trigger its photoelectric sensor. The spacecraft was still in solar orbit as of 1969. It was the only successful lunar probe launched by the U.S. in 12 attempts between 1958 and 1963; only in 1964 would Ranger 7 surpass its success by accomplishing all of its mission objectives.

After the Soviet Luna 1 probe conducted the first successful flyby of the Moon on 3 January 1959, the pressure felt by the US to succeed with a lunar mission was enormous, especially since American mission failures were entirely public while the Soviet failures were kept a secret.

== Spacecraft design ==
&quot;Pioneer 4&quot; was a cone-shaped probe 51 cm high and 23 cm in diameter at its base. The cone was composed of a thin fiberglass shell coated with a gold wash to make it electrically conducting and painted with white stripes to maintain the temperature between 10 and 50 °C. At the tip of the cone was a small probe which combined with the cone itself to act as an antenna. At the base of the cone, a ring of mercury batteries provided power. A photoelectric sensor protruded from the center of the ring. The sensor was designed with two photocells which would be triggered by the light of the Moon when the probe was within about 30,000 km of the Moon. At the center of the cone was a voltage supply tube and two Geiger–Müller tubes. The Laboratory&#x27;s Microlock system, used for communicating with earlier Explorer satellites, did not have sufficient range to perform this mission. Therefore, a new radio system called TRAC(E) &quot;Tracking And Communication (Extraterrestrial)&quot; was designed. TRAC(E) was an integral part of the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex. A transmitter with a mass of 0.5 kg delivered a phase modulated signal of 0.1 W at a frequency of 960.05 MHz. The modulated carrier power was 0.08 W and the total effective radiated power 0.18 W. A despin mechanism consisted of two 7 gram weights which spooled out to the end of two 150 cm wires when triggered by a hydraulic timer 10 hours after launch. The weights were designed to slow the spacecraft spin from 400 rpm to 6 rpm, and then weights and wires were released. Pioneer 4 received a few small modifications over its predecessor, namely added lead shielding around the Geiger tubes and modifications to the telemetry system to improve its reliability and signal strength. The probe had S/N #4, with probe #3 recalled from launch due to technical issues.

== Launch vehicle ==
&quot;Pioneer 4&quot; was launched with a Juno II launch vehicle, which also launched &quot;Pioneer 3&quot;. Juno II closely resembled the Juno I (Jupiter-C based) vehicle that launched Explorer 1. Its first stage was a 19.51 m elongated Jupiter IRBM missile that was used by the U.S. Army. On top of the Jupiter propulsion section was a guidance and control compartment that supported a rotating tub containing the rocket stages 2, 3 and 4. &quot;Pioneer 4&quot; was mounted on top of stage 4.

== Mission ==
At 05:10:56 GMT on the night of 3 March 1959, Pioneer 4 lifted off from LC-5 at Cape Canaveral. This time, the booster performed almost perfectly so that &quot;Pioneer 4&quot; achieved its primary objective (an Earth-Moon trajectory), returned radiation data and provided a valuable tracking exercise. A slightly longer than nominal second stage burn, however, was enough to induce small trajectory and velocity errors, so that the probe passed within 58,983 km of the Moon&#x27;s surface (7.2° E, 5.7° S) on 4 March 1959 at 22:25 GMT (5:25 p.m. EST) at a speed of 7230 km/h. The distance was not close enough to trigger the photoelectric sensor. This scanning device was being tested for use in future probes to activate either a film or vidicon camera. The probe continued transmitting radiation data for 82.5 hours, to a distance of , and reached perihelion on 18 March 1959 at 01:00 GMT. The cylindrical fourth stage casing (173 cm long, 15 cm diameter, 4.65 kg) went into orbit with the probe. The communication system had worked well, and it was estimated that signals could have been received out to had there been enough battery power.

<text>Polybus (; fl. 400 BC) was one of the pupils of Hippocrates, and also his son-in-law. He lived on the island of Cos in the 4th century BC. With his brothers-in-law, Thessalus and Draco, he was one of the founders of the Dogmatic school of medicine. He was sent by Hippocrates, with his fellow-pupils, during the time of the plague, to assist different cities with his medical skill. Afterwards, he remained in his native country. According to Galen, he followed implicitly the opinions and practices of Hippocrates, but the strict accuracy of this assertion has been doubted. 

He has been supposed, by both ancient and modern scholars, to be the author of several works in the Hippocratic collection. Possible works include &quot;De Natura Hominis&quot;, &quot;De Genitura&quot;, &quot;De Natura Pueri&quot;, &quot;De Salubri Victus Ratione&quot;, &quot;De Affectionibus&quot;, and &quot;De Internis Affectionibus&quot;. Clement of Alexandria attributes to him the treatise &quot;De Octimestri Partu&quot;, and Pseudo-Plutarch quotes him as the author of &quot;De Septimestri Partu&quot;. &quot;De Natura Hominis&quot; (&quot;On the Nature of Man&quot;) is the earliest known text to advance a four-humor system of blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile. Galen, though, considers &quot;De Natura Hominis&quot; to be the work of Hippocrates himself.

Polybus is mentioned many times by Galen, chiefly in connection with different works in the Hippocratic collection. He is also mentioned by Celsus, Caelius Aurelianus, and Pliny.

<doc id="82016" wikidata="Q109661" url="?curid=82016" title="Madera County, California">
<text>Madera County (), officially the County of Madera, is a county located at the geographic center of the U.S. state of California. It features a varied landscape, encompassing the eastern San Joaquin Valley and the central Sierra Nevada, with Madera serving as the county seat. Established in 1893 from part of Fresno County, Madera County reported a population of 156,255 in the 2020 census.

&quot;Madera,&quot; meaning &quot;wood&quot; in Spanish, signifies the county&#x27;s historical ties to the lumber industry. With a section of Yosemite National Park within its borders, Madera County has leveraged tourism as a key economic driver. Additionally, it has established itself as a leading agricultural center, renowned for its substantial production of almonds, grapes, and pistachios. Despite these economic advantages, Madera County encounters socioeconomic challenges, including a median household income that falls below the California average and poverty rates that exceed state averages, underscoring the economic disparities within the county.

Madera County is characterized by its diverse population, including a pronounced Native American heritage and a history of immigration and migration dating back to the California Gold Rush. The county has a 59.6% Hispanic or Latino population and 20.3% of residents are foreign-born, both percentages surpassing the national averages. Additionally, nearly half of Madera County&#x27;s population speaks a language other than English at home, reflecting its multicultural composition.

==Etymology==

Madera is the Spanish term for wood. The county derives its name from the town of Madera, named when the California Lumber Company built a log flume to carry lumber to the Central Pacific Railroad there in 1876.

== History ==
Madera County was formed in 1893 from Fresno County during a special election held in Fresno on May 16, 1893. Citizens residing in the area that was to become Madera County voted 1,179 to 358 for separation from Fresno County and the establishment of Madera County.

The Madera County Sheriff&#x27;s Department employed the first woman in California to die in the line of duty as a sworn law enforcement officer—Tulare native Lucille Helm (1914–1959). For 15 years, the Madera housewife and mother of four worked on call as a &quot;matron&quot; assisting with female transfers.

=== Human History ===

====Native People====

The region now known as Madera County was originally the territory of several Native American tribes, notably the Mono, Chukchansi, and Miwok. The Mono inhabited the upper San Joaquin River region, encompassing areas around North Fork and Crane Valley. The Chukchansi tribe lived in what are today the communities of Oakhurst, Coarsegold, Ahwahnee, and the lower foothills extending to the San Joaquin Valley. Meanwhile, the Miwok were located in the vicinity of Ahwahnee, Wawona, Mariposa, and the Yosemite Valley.

Following the California Gold Rush, many Native American communities were displaced, a situation exacerbated by the Mariposa War and institutionalized by the Act for the Government and Protection of Indians. Despite these adversities, several communities persevered in their traditional lifestyles. However, the creation of the Sierra National Forest in 1897 introduced a citizen-only land use permit system, effectively excluding Native Americans until they were granted citizenship in 1924 through the Indian Citizenship Act.

===Immigration and Migration===

==== Early United States Era ====
Since the area was part of Mexico until 1848, it has maintained a significant population of Mexican descent. After the California Gold Rush, the region became a vibrant mosaic, drawing individuals from across the United States and beyond. 
Chinese laborers played a key role in constructing the Madera Flume and working in the Sugar Pine lumber yards. However, their numbers declined after restrictive immigration laws like the Chinese Exclusion Act and the Immigration Act of 1917 were enacted. This led to Mexican immigrants filling the roles previously held by Chinese workers, signifying a notable change in the area&#x27;s labor dynamics.

==== 20th century ====
During the 1930s, Madera County became a destination for significant numbers of refugees from the Dust Bowl, primarily originating from Oklahoma and Arkansas.

In the mid-20th century, the Bracero Program, designed to recruit labor from Mexico, played a crucial role in mitigating the agricultural labor shortages that arose during World War II and the Korean War. Advocated by the Madera County Chamber of Commerce, efforts were made to persuade the federal government to prolong the guest worker program beyond its original expiration in 1964. Despite the program&#x27;s conclusion, labor migration continued, and by the end of the century, Madera County had become increasingly dependent on a migrant workforce. As of the 1990s, this workforce was predominantly composed of Mixtecs from Oaxaca, Mexico, numbering an estimated 5,000 individuals.

== Geography ==

Madera County is characterized by its diverse landscapes, encompassing the fertile San Joaquin Valley, grasslands and oak woodlands of the foothills, and the rugged Sierra Nevada mountains. A significant part of Yosemite National Park, known for its wilderness and alpine areas, lies within the county. Madera County also hosts important waterways, including parts of the San Joaquin River and several lakes and reservoirs, vital for agriculture, ecosystems, and recreation.

The county experiences a range of climates, from arid in the valley to alpine in the higher Sierra Nevada, creating diverse microclimates and environments across the area.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.8%, is water.

Madera County is part of the Madera AVA wine region.

== Demographics ==
=== 2020 Census ===

Madera County&#x27;s demographic composition and economic indicators reveal contrasts with both state and national averages. The county&#x27;s median household income is reported at $76,920, which is below California&#x27;s median of $91,551, reflecting economic disparities within the region. Additionally, Madera County&#x27;s poverty rate of 24.3% surpasses the state&#x27;s 12.2% rate, underscoring significant economic challenges, particularly affecting children under 18, with 38.2% living in poverty. Comparatively, Madera County&#x27;s median income slightly exceeds the national median of $69,717. However, its poverty rate of 22.0% also exceeds the national average, indicating a notable income inequality within the county.

In terms of housing, Madera County offers relatively more affordable options compared to the rest of California, with a median gross rent of $1,189 against the state&#x27;s $1,870. The homeownership rate in Madera County is 69.0%, which is higher than California&#x27;s rate of 55.8%.

The labor force participation rate in Madera County is 56.4%, which is lower than the national rate. The county has a youthful demographic, with 27.1% under 18 years old, compared to the national figure of 22.4%. The percentage of elderly residents in Madera County is slightly below the U.S. average.

Madera County is notable for its higher percentage of foreign-born residents at 20.3%, surpassing the national average. This contributes to the county&#x27;s multicultural identity, with a significant Hispanic or Latino population of 59.6%. Linguistic diversity is evident, with 46.5% of residents speaking a language other than English at home. An estimated 12,500 to 15,000 people in Madera County are undocumented immigrants.

Educational attainment in Madera County shows that 21.4% of its population holds a Bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher, which is below the California average.

== Economy ==

===19th and 20th century===
Madera County&#x27;s origins are deeply rooted in boom-and-bust cycles, primarily driven by extractive industries. Initially, the county&#x27;s economy was heavily reliant on mineral extraction and timber harvesting. Over time, agriculture and ag related industries became the predominant employer and economic force.

==== Gold ====
Madera County became known for gold mining during the California Gold Rush. Madera County, created in 1893 from a portion of Fresno County, encompassed most of the region&#x27;s productive gold mines. These mines, located primarily at the junction of the Sierra Nevada batholith with pre-Cretaceous schist and slate, stretched from Grub Gulch to Hildreth.

Grub Gulch, located near the end of Highway 49, was a gold rush town renowned for its easily accessible gold. Initially, Grub Gulch was a simple shanty town of tents, but it blossomed into a bustling community in the late 1880s, spurred by successful placer mining in nearby streams. At its peak, the town boasted five saloons, a general store, a post office, and a boarding house. Remarkably, out of the $1.35 million worth of gold extracted from Madera County, nearly $1 million originated from Grub Gulch.

By the 1950s, gold production had significantly dropped, primarily from dredging operations along the Fresno, Chowchilla, and San Joaquin Rivers with almost no production after 1959.

====Tungsten====
In the mid-20th century, Madera County&#x27;s High Sierra regions became prominent for their significant tungsten deposits, leading to extensive mining activities near Mammoth Lakes, Central Camp, and Fish Camp. One notable example, the Strawberry Tungsten Mine, was valued at $1 million in 1955 and had the capacity to process 310 metric tons of ore daily by 1981.

However, tungsten mining in the Sierra Nevada faced challenges due to harsh winter conditions and intense competition from low-cost tungsten imports from China. These challenges were part of a broader decline in the U.S. starting in the 1980s, caused by falling market prices and economic issues, resulting in a major decrease in tungsten mining nationwide. As a result, tungsten mining in Madera County and the rest of the Sierra Nevada has stopped entirely.

====Lumber====
 The discovery of gold was quickly followed by a high demand for lumber, which was essential for constructing sluice boxes and building early settlements. The first sawmill in the county was constructed in 1852 on the east fork of Redwood Creek, north of Oakhurst, in an area currently known as Old Corral. This mill primarily provided lumber to miners and settlers in the Coarsegold and Fresno Flats areas. In 1854, Charles Converse and Bill Chitister purchased the mill and relocated it to Crane Valley, the area now known as Bass Lake.

In 1872, the California Lumber Company initiated the region&#x27;s first major lumber operation with a steam mill near Nelder Grove. They built a record-setting long log flume to Madera to float finished lumber to market. Although it ran out of money in 1874, it was restructured and operated at a profit for the next four decades.

During the Great Depression, Madera County&#x27;s lumber industry and logging railroads ceased operations. In 1941, the industry recovered when a new sawmill in North Fork was built, which used logging trucks and advanced equipment for deeper access into the Sierra National Forest. However, in the early 1990s, tighter government rules reduced forest yields, hurting the mill&#x27;s profits. This downturn led to the end of Madera County&#x27;s logging era in February 1994, when the last log was processed.

===Areas Inaccessible by Road===

In Madera County, eastern regions such as Devil&#x27;s Postpile National Monument and part of Minaret Summit are isolated from the rest of the county due to a lack of connecting roads. Access to this area is primarily through Minaret Summit Road, which becomes State Route 203 upon reaching the Mono County border and leads to Mammoth Lakes. Red&#x27;s Meadow Road is a further extension of this route.

A gap of less than separates the end of Minaret Road in the Western Sierra, which begins in North Fork and extends northeast into the Sierra, and the terminus of Red&#x27;s Meadow Road in the Eastern Sierra. In the early to mid-20th century, plans were considered for building a highway or tunnel that would link the Eastern Sierra to the San Joaquin Valley through Minaret Summit. To maintain the feasibility of this project, an area southwest of Minaret Summit was intentionally left out of the Wilderness Act of 1964. This exclusion was aimed at keeping the option open for the construction of a Trans-Sierra Highway.

During his tenure as Governor of California, Ronald Reagan embarked on a horse packing trip in this area. Following this experience, Reagan aligned with conservationists to oppose the construction of the road. His efforts persisted after his election as President in 1980, culminating in the designation of this area as wilderness under the California Wilderness Act of 1984.

<text>Marin County ( ) is a county located in the northwestern part of the San Francisco Bay Area of the U.S. state of California. As of the 2020 census, the population was 262,231. Its county seat and largest city is San Rafael. Marin County is across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco, and is included in the San Francisco–Oakland–Berkeley, CA Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Marin County&#x27;s natural sites include the Muir Woods redwood forest, the Marin Headlands, Stinson Beach, the Point Reyes National Seashore, and Mount Tamalpais. Marin is one of the highest-income counties by per capita income and median household income. The county is governed by the Marin County Board of Supervisors.

The Marin County Civic Center was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and draws thousands of visitors a year to guided tours of its arch and atrium design. In 1994, a new county jail facility was embedded into the hillside nearby.

The United States&#x27; oldest cross country running event, the Dipsea Race, takes place annually in Marin County, attracting thousands of athletes. Modern mountain biking has many early origins on the slopes of Mount Tamalpais in Marin. 
San Quentin State Prison is located in the county.

==History==

=== Native American settlement ===

Thousands of years ago, Coast Miwok people first populated the area today known as Marin County.

In 1770, Coast Miwok population ranged from 1,500 to 2,000, with about 600 village sites throughout the county.

In 1967, the Marin Museum of the American Indian was established, with exhibits focusing on Coast Miwok artifacts, crafts, and artwork. As of 2021, Indigenous-led events include healing drumming, dogbane cordage demonstrations, trade feasts, and traditional dancing.

=== History of Marin ===
During the Mexican-American war, areas of Marin County were seized by Americans as part of the conquest of California (1846–1847). Marin County is one of the original 27 counties of California, created February 18, 1850, following adoption of the California Constitution of 1849 and just months before the state was admitted to the Union.
According to General Mariano Vallejo, who headed an 1850 committee to name California&#x27;s counties, the county was named for &quot;Marin,&quot; great chief of the tribe Licatiut.&quot; Marin had been named &quot;Huicmuse&quot; until he was baptized as &quot;Marino&quot; at about age 20. Marin / Marino was born into the Huimen people, a Coast Miwok tribe of Native Americans who inhabited the San Rafael area. Vallejo believed that &quot;Chief Marin&quot; had waged several fierce battles against the Spanish. Marino definitely did reside at Mission Dolores (in modern San Francisco) much of the time from his 1801 baptism and marriage until 1817, frequently serving as a baptism witness and godfather; he may have escaped and been recaptured at some point during that time. Starting in 1817, he served as an alcalde (in effect, an overseer) at the San Rafael Mission, where he lived from 1817 off and on until his death. In 1821, Marino served as an expedition guide for the Spanish for a couple of years before escaping and hiding out for some months in the tiny Marin Islands (also named after him); his recapture resulted in a yearlong incarceration at the Presidio before his return to the Mission San Rafael area for about 15 years until his death in 1839. In 2009, a plaque commemorating Chief Marin was placed in Mill Valley.

Another version of the origin of the county name is that the bay between San Pedro Point and San Quentin Point was named &quot;Bahía de Nuestra Señora del Rosario la Marinera&quot; in 1775, and that Marin is simply an abbreviation of this name.

Francis Drake and the crew of the &quot;Golden Hind&quot; was thought to have landed on the Marin coast in 1579 claiming the land as &quot;Nova Albion&quot;. A bronze plaque inscribed with Drake&#x27;s claim to the new lands, fitting the description in Drake&#x27;s own account, was discovered in 1933. This so-called &quot;Drake&#x27;s Plate of Brass&quot; was revealed as a hoax in 2003.

In 1595, Sebastian Cermeno lost his ship, the &quot;San Agustin&quot;, while exploring the Marin Coast. The Spanish explorer Vizcaíno landed about twenty years after Drake in what is now called Drakes Bay. However the first Spanish settlement in Marin was not established until 1817 when Mission San Rafael Arcángel was founded partly in response to the Russian-built Fort Ross to the north in what is now Sonoma County. 
Mission San Rafael Arcángel was founded in what is now downtown San Rafael as the 20th Spanish mission in the colonial Mexican province of &quot;Alta California&quot; by four priests, Father Narciso Duran from Mission San Jose, Father Abella from Mission San Francisco de Asís, Father Gil y Taboada and Father Mariano Payeras, the President of the Missions, on December 14, 1817, four years before Mexico gained independence from Spain.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and , comprising 37.2%, is water. It is the fourth-smallest county in California by land area. According to the records at the County Assessor-Recorder&#x27;s Office, as of June 2006, Marin had of taxable land, consisting of 79,086 parcels with a total tax basis of $39.8 billion. These parcels are divided into the following classifications:


Geographically, the county forms a large, southward-facing peninsula, with the Pacific Ocean to the west, San Pablo Bay, and San Francisco Bay to the east, and – across the Golden Gate – the city of San Francisco to the south. Marin County&#x27;s northern border is with Sonoma County.

Most of the county&#x27;s population resides on the eastern side, with a string of communities running along U.S. Route 101 and the San Francisco Bay, from Sausalito to Tiburon to Corte Madera to San Rafael and Novato. The interior contains large areas of agricultural and open space; West Marin, through which State Route 1 runs alongside the California coast, contains many small unincorporated communities whose economies depend on agriculture and tourism. West Marin has beaches which are popular destinations for surfers and tourists year-round.

Notable features of the shoreline along the San Francisco Bay include the Sausalito shoreline, Richardson Bay, the Tiburon Peninsula, Ring Mountain, and Triangle Marsh at Corte Madera. Further north lies San Quentin State Prison along the San Rafael shoreline.

==Ecology==

Marin County is considered in the California Floristic Province, a zone of extremely high biodiversity and endemism. There are numerous ecosystems present, including Coastal Strand, oak woodland, mixed evergreen forest, and Coast Redwood Forests chaparral and riparian zones. There are also a considerable number of protected plant and animal species present: Fauna include the California red-legged frog (&quot;Rana draytonii&quot;) and California freshwater shrimp while flora include Marin Dwarf Flax, &quot;Hesperolinon congestum&quot;; Tiburon Jewelflower, &quot;Streptanthus niger&quot;; and Tiburon Indian paintbrush, &quot;Castilleja neglecta&quot;.
A number of watersheds exist in Marin County, including Walker Creek, Lagunitas Creek, Miller Creek, and Novato Creek.

Notably, the Lagunitas Creek Watershed is home to the largest remaining wild run of coho salmon (&quot;Oncorhynchus kisutch&quot;) in Central California. These coho are part of the &quot;Central California Coast Evolutionarily Significant Unit, &quot; or CCC ESU, and are listed as &quot;endangered&quot; at both the state and federal level.

Significant efforts to protect and restore these fish have been underway in the Watershed since the 1980s. Fifty percent of historical salmon habitat is now behind dams. Strong efforts are also being made to protect and restore undammed, headwater reaches of this Watershed in the San Geronimo Valley, where upwards of 40% of the Lagunitas salmon spawn each year and where as much as 1/3 of the juvenile salmon (or fry) spend their entire freshwater lives. The &quot;Salmon Protection and Watershed Network&quot; leads winter tours for the public to learn about and view these spawning salmon, and also leads year-round opportunities for the public to get involved in stream restoration, monitoring spawning and smolt outmigration, juvenile fish rescue and relocation in the summer, and advocacy and policy development. Around 490 different species of birds have been observed in Marin County.
Despite the lack of rain in the Marin County area due to historic drought levels, in 2014, an estimated 20,000 juvenile Coho salmon made the migration from their spawning grounds in the Lagunitas Creek area to the Pacific Ocean. This increase in migration was significantly up from the previous historic record for the same migration measured in 2006 at 11,000.

In 2010, all of the county&#x27;s beaches were listed as the cleanest in the state.

When Richard Henry Dana Jr. visited San Francisco Bay in 1835, he wrote about vast tule elk (&quot;Cervus canadensis nannodes&quot;) herds near the Golden Gate on December 27: &quot;...we came to anchor near the mouth of the bay, under a high and beautifully sloping hill, upon which herds of hundreds and hundreds of red deer [note: &quot;red deer&quot; is the European term for &quot;elk&quot;], and the stag, with his high branching antlers, were bounding about...,&quot; although it is not clear whether this was the Marin side or the San Francisco side.

=== Overview ===

For most of the 20th century, Marin County was a Republican stronghold in presidential elections. From 1880 until 1984, the only Democrats to win there were Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson. However, the brand of Republicanism prevailing in Marin County was historically a moderate one. Like most of the historically Republican suburbs of the Bay Area, it became friendlier to Democrats as the demographics of the area changed and the national party embraced social and religious conservatism. In 1984, it very narrowly voted for Walter Mondale and has supported the Democratic candidate in every presidential election since then. Out of all California counties, only San Francisco County voted more Democratic in the 2020 presidential election.

The official tally was 103,341 against and 34,324 in favor. Only San Francisco County voted against the measure by a wider margin (75.2% against).

According to the California Secretary of State, as of February 10, 2019, Marin County has 161,870 registered voters.

Lea who served in the House from 1917 to 1949.

Due to the rapidly expanding nature of California&#x27;s population, Marin&#x27;s congressional district has changed numerous times over the decades. The county has been part of the 2nd congressional district of California since 2012; the only other time it was part of the 2nd district was 1902–12. It has also been part of the 1st (1894–1902 and 1912–66), 3rd (1864–94), 5th (1974–82), and the 6th (1972–74 and 1982–2012). The only time the county has not been in a single congressional district was between 1966 and 1972, when it was divided between the northern half in the 1st district and the southern half in the 6th district.

===&quot;Marin County hot-tubber&quot; ===
In 2002, former U.S. President George H. W. Bush denounced convicted American Taliban associate John Walker Lindh as &quot;some misguided Marin County hot-tubber,&quot; as a reference to the county&#x27;s liberal, &quot;hippie&quot; political culture, mispronouncing &quot;Marin&quot; as he did so. Outraged by the label, some local residents wrote scathing letters to the &quot;Marin Independent Journal&quot;, complaining of Bush&#x27;s remarks. In response, Bush wrote a letter to readers in the same newspaper, admitting regret and promising to not use the phrases &quot;Marin County&quot; and &quot;hot tub&quot; &quot;in the same sentence again.&quot;

<text>Envisat (&quot;Environmental Satellite&quot;) is a large Earth-observing satellite which has been inactive since 2012. It is still in orbit and considered space debris. Operated by the European Space Agency (ESA), it was the world&#x27;s largest civilian Earth observation satellite.

It was launched on 1 March 2002 aboard an Ariane 5 from the Guyana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana, into a Sun synchronous polar orbit at an altitude of 790 ± 10 km. It orbits the Earth in about 101 minutes, with a repeat cycle of 35 days. After losing contact with the satellite on 8 April 2012, ESA formally announced the end of Envisat&#x27;s mission on 9 May 2012.

Envisat cost 2.3 billion Euro (including 300 million Euro for 5 years of operations) to develop and launch. The mission has been replaced by the Sentinel series of satellites. The first of these, Sentinel 1, has taken over the radar duties of Envisat since its launch in 2014.

== Mission ==
Envisat was launched as an Earth observation satellite. Its objective was to support the continuity of European Remote-Sensing Satellite missions, providing additional observations to improve environmental studies.

To accomplish the global and regional objectives of the mission, numerous scientific disciplines used the data acquired from the sensors on the satellite to study atmospheric chemistry, ozone depletion, biological oceanography, ocean temperature and colour, wind waves, hydrology (humidity, floods), agriculture and arboriculture, natural hazards, digital elevation modelling (using interferometry), monitoring of maritime traffic, atmospheric dispersion modelling (pollution), cartography and snow and ice.

==Specifications==
;Dimensions
 × × in orbit with the solar array deployed.

;Mass
, including of fuel and a instrument payload.
;Power
Solar array with a total load of 3560 W.

== Instruments ==

Envisat carries an array of nine Earth-observation instruments that gathered information about the Earth (land, water, ice, and atmosphere) using a variety of measurement principles. A tenth instrument, DORIS, provided guidance and control. Several of the instruments were advanced versions of instruments that were flown on the earlier ERS-1 and ERS 2 missions and other satellites.

=== MWR ===
MWR (Microwave Radiometer) was designed for measuring water vapour in the atmosphere.

=== AATSR ===

AATSR (Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer) can measure the sea surface temperature in the visible and infrared spectra. It is the successor of ATSR1 and ATSR2, payloads of ERS 1 and ERS 2. AATSR can measure Earth&#x27;s surface temperature to a precision of , for climate research. Among the secondary objectives of AATSR is the observation of environmental parameters such as water content, biomass, and vegetal health and growth.

=== MIPAS ===
MIPAS (Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding) is a Fourier transforming infrared spectrometer which provides pressure and temperature profiles, and profiles of trace gases nitrogen dioxide (), nitrous oxide (), methane (), nitric acid (), ozone (), and water () in the stratosphere. The instrument functions with high spectral resolution in an extended spectral band, which allows coverage across the Earth in all seasons and at equal quality night and day. MIPAS has a vertical resolution of depending on altitude (the larger at the level of the upper stratosphere).

=== MERIS ===
MERIS (MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) measures the reflectance of the Earth (surface and atmosphere) in the solar spectral range (390 to 1040 nm) and transmits 15 spectral bands back to the ground segment. MERIS was built at the Cannes Mandelieu Space Center.

=== SCIAMACHY ===
SCIAMACHY (SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY) compares light coming from the sun to light reflected by the Earth, which provides information on the atmosphere through which the Earth-reflected light has passed.

SCIAMACHY is an image spectrometer with the principal objective of mapping the concentration of trace gases and aerosols in the troposphere and stratosphere. Rays of sunlight that are reflected transmitted, backscattered and reflected by the atmosphere are captured at a high spectral resolution (0.2 to 0.5 nm) for wavelengths between 240 and 1700 nm, and in certain spectra between 2,000 and 2,400 nm. Its high spectral resolution over a wide range of wavelengths can detect many trace gases even in tiny concentrations. The wavelengths captured also allow effective detection of aerosols and clouds.
SCIAMACHY uses 3 different targeting modes: to the nadir (against the sun), to the limbus (through the atmospheric corona), and during solar or lunar eclipses. SCIAMACHY was built by Netherlands and Germany at TNO/TPD, SRON and Airbus Defence and Space Netherlands.

=== RA-2 ===
RA-2 (Radar Altimeter 2) is a dual-frequency Nadir pointing Radar operating in the Ku band and S bands, it is used to define ocean topography, map/monitor sea ice and measure land heights.

Mean sea level measurements from Envisat are continuously graphed at the Centre National d&#x27;Etudes Spatiales web site, on the Aviso page.

=== ASAR ===
ASAR (Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar) operates in the C band in a wide variety of modes. It can detect changes in surface heights with sub-millimeter precision. It served as a data link for ERS 1 and ERS 2, providing numerous functions such as observations of different polarities of light or combining different polarities, angles of incidence and spatial resolutions.
These different types of raw data can be given several levels of treatment (suffixed to the ID of the acquisition mode: IMP, APS, and so on):
* RAW (raw data, or &quot;Level 0&quot;), which contains all the information necessary to create images.
* S (complex data, &quot;Single Look Complex&quot;), images in complex numeric form, the real and imaginary parts of the output of the compression algorithm
* P (precision image), amplified image with constant pixel width (12.5 m for IMP)
* M (medium precision image), amplified radiometry image with a resolution greater than P
* G (geocoded image), amplified image to which simple geographical transforms have been applied to show relief.

Data capture in WV mode is unusual in that they constitute a series of 5 km × 5 km spaced at 100 km.

=== DORIS ===
DORIS (Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite) determines the satellite&#x27;s orbit to within .

=== GOMOS ===
GOMOS (Global Ozone Monitoring by Occultation of Stars) looks at stars as they descend through the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and change colour, allowing measurement of gases such as ozone (), including their vertical distribution.

GOMOS uses the principle of occultation. Its sensors detect light from a star traversing the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and measures the depletion of that light by trace gases nitrogen dioxide (), nitrogen trioxide, (), ), ozone () and aerosols present between about altitude. It has a resolution of .

=== Loss of contact ===
ESA announced on 12 April 2012 that they lost contact with Envisat on Sunday, 8 April 2012, after 10 years of service, exceeding the initially planned life span by 5 years. The spacecraft was still in a stable orbit, but attempts to contact it were unsuccessful. Ground-based radar and the French Pleiades Earth probe were used to image the silent Envisat and look for damage. ESA formally announced the end of Envisat&#x27;s mission on 9 May 2012.

Envisat was launched in 2002 and it operated five years beyond its planned mission lifetime, delivering over a petabyte of data. ESA was expecting to turn off the spacecraft in 2014.
=== Space safety ===

Envisat poses a hazard because of the risk of collisions with space debris. Given its orbit and its area-to-mass ratio, it will take about 150 years for the satellite to be gradually pulled into the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Envisat is currently orbiting in an environment where two catalogued space debris objects can be expected to pass within about of it every year, which would likely trigger the need for a manoeuvre to avoid a possible collision. A collision between a satellite the size of Envisat and an object as small as 10 kg could produce a very large cloud of debris, initiating a self-sustaining chain-reaction of collisions and fragmentation with production of new debris, a phenomenon known as the Kessler Syndrome.

Envisat was a candidate for a mission to remove it from orbit, called e.Deorbit. The spacecraft sent to bring down Envisat would itself need to have a mass of approximately 1.6 tonnes.

<text>Mariposa County () is a county located in the U.S. state of California. As of the 2020 U.S. Census, the population was 17,131. The county seat is Mariposa. It is located in the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains, north of Fresno, east of Merced, and southeast of Stockton.

The county&#x27;s eastern section is the central portion of Yosemite National Park.

Mariposa County is one of only three counties in California that does not include any incorporated cities (with Alpine and Trinity counties being the other two). The county does include, however, 17 communities that are recognized as census-designated places for statistical purposes. It also has the distinction of not having any permanent traffic signals anywhere in the county.

==History==
Mariposa County was one of the original 27 counties of California, created at the time of statehood in 1850. While it began as the state&#x27;s largest county, territory that was once part of Mariposa was ceded over time to form all or part of twelve other counties, including all of Merced, Madera, Fresno, Tulare, Kings, and Kern; and parts of San Benito, Mono, Inyo, San Bernardino, and Los Angeles. Thus, Mariposa County is known as the &quot;Mother of Counties&quot;.

Mariposa County&#x27;s original seat was a now-nonexistent hamlet known as Agua Fria (Spanish for &quot;cold water&quot;), about 3 miles directly west of Mariposa proper on Agua Fria Road, which runs from Highway 140 to the south, to the community of Mt. Bullion to the northwest. Charles Fremont moved the county seat to Mariposa in 1854, resulting in the construction of the Mariposa County Courthouse, whose grounds occupies an entire block. The historic structure is fronted by Bullion Street; Jones Street is to the rear, with 9th and 10th Streets on either side. The courthouse&#x27;s likeness is on the Mariposa County Seal. 

The county took its name from Mariposa Creek, which was so named by Spanish explorers in 1806, when they discovered a great cluster of butterflies (&quot;mariposas&quot; in Spanish and Portuguese) in the foothills of the Sierra. Each year, the first weekend in May, residents mark the annual arrival of migrating monarch butterflies with a &quot;Butterfly Days&quot; festival and parade.

===Gold Rush===

Mariposa County is located at the southern end of California&#x27;s Mother Lode region. During the California Gold Rush, great quantities of the prized mineral were found and extracted, first in local stream-beds and later in hard rock mines. One of the most notable beneficiaries of this wealth was the famed explorer and 1856 Republican presidential candidate, John Charles Frémont, for whom the local hospital and Charles Street (more commonly known as &quot;Highway 140&quot;) are named. Jessie Street, in the town of Mariposa, is named for Fremont&#x27;s wife, Jessie Benton Frémont, who came to Mariposa with her husband on many extended visits although they never took up permanent residence within the county.

Many aspects of the area&#x27;s mining history are depicted in exhibits at two local museums: the Mariposa History Museum, located in the town of Mariposa; and the California Mining and Mineral Museum, located at the Mariposa Fairgrounds (2 miles southeast of Mariposa on Highway 49).

Two small gold mines in Mariposa County, the Mockingbird mine and the Colorado Quartz mine, intermittently produce world-class (and very expensive) specimens of crystalline gold for mineral collectors. &quot;Specimens from these occurrences commonly have bright luster and rich color, with well-developed crystals in unusual and attractive arrangements.&quot; The best-known example is &quot;The Dragon&quot;, now on display at the Houston Museum of Natural Science.

<text>Mendocino County (; &quot;Mendocino&quot;, Spanish for &quot;of Mendoza&quot;) is a county located on the North Coast of the U.S. state of California. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 91,601. The county seat is Ukiah.

Mendocino County consists wholly of the Ukiah, California Micropolitan Statistical Area (μSA) for the purposes of the U.S. Census Bureau. It is located approximately equidistant from the San Francisco Bay Area and California/Oregon border, separated from the Sacramento Valley to the east by the California Coast Ranges. While smaller areas of redwood forest are found further south, it is the southernmost California county to be included in the World Wildlife Fund&#x27;s Pacific temperate rainforests ecoregion, the largest temperate rainforest ecoregion on Earth.

The county is noted for its distinctive Pacific Ocean coastline, its location along California&#x27;s &quot;Lost Coast&quot;, Redwood forests, wine production, microbrews, and liberal views about the use of cannabis and support for its legalization. In 2009, it was estimated that roughly one-third of the economy was based on the cultivation of marijuana.
Mendocino is one of three Northern California counties to make up the &quot;Emerald Triangle&quot;, along with Humboldt and Trinity counties.

==History==
Mendocino County was one of the original counties of California, created in 1850 at the time of statehood. Due to an initially minor settler American population, it did not have a separate government until 1859 and was under the administration of Sonoma County prior to that. Some of the county&#x27;s land was given to Sonoma County between 1850 and 1860.

The county derives its name from Cape Mendocino (most of which is actually located in adjacent Humboldt County), which was probably named in honor of either Antonio de Mendoza, Viceroy of New Spain, 1535–1542 (who sent the Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo Expedition to this coast in 1542), or Lorenzo Suárez de Mendoza, Viceroy from 1580 to 1583. &quot;Mendocino&quot; is the adjectival form of the family name of Mendoza.

Neither Spanish nor Mexican influence extended into Mendocino County beyond the establishment of two Mexican land grants in southern Mendocino County: Rancho Sanel in Hopland, in 1844 and Rancho Yokaya that forms the majority of the Ukiah Valley, in 1845.

In the 19th century, despite the establishment of the Mendocino Indian Reservation and Nome Cult Farm in 1856, the county witnessed many of the most serious atrocities in the extermination of the Californian Native American tribes who originally lived in the area, like the Yuki, the Pomo, the Cahto, and the Wintun. The systematic occupation of their lands, the reduction of many of their members into slavery and the raids against their settlements led to the Mendocino War in 1859, where hundreds of Indians were killed. Establishment of the Round Valley Indian Reservation on March 30, 1870, did not prevent the segregation that continued well into the 20th century. Other tribes from the Sierra Nevada mountains were also relocated to the Round Valley Indian Reservation during the &quot;California Trail Of Tears&quot;, where the Natives were forced to march in bad conditions to their new home in Round Valley. Many of these tribes thrown together were not on good terms with the other tribes they were forced to live with on the reservation, resulting in tensions still evident today.

===Boundary dispute with Trinity County===
In the first half of the 1850&#x27;s the California State Legislature established that the boundaries of Mendocino and Trinity Counties was the 40th parallel north. Both county board of supervisor&#x27;s hired the surveyor W.H. Fauntleroy to survey the parallel, which he completed on October 30, 1872. The accuracy of the boundary was doubtful, and by 1891 the Mendocino County Board of Supervisors requested the California surveyor-general to survey the line and establish the boundaries between the two counties. The new line, as surveyed by Sam H. Rice and approved by the California Attorney General on December 18, 1891, was found to be 2 miles north of the common boundary surveyed by W.H. Fauntleroy, thereby resulting in Trinity County exercising jurisdiction two miles south of the 40th parallel north. Between 1891 and 1907, both counties claimed that the 2 mile wide strip of land belonged to themselves and not the other, with both counties attempting to levy and collect property tax land in said strip. In 1907, Trinity County sued Mendocino County in a Tehama County court to settle the dispute. The trial court in Tehama County ruled in favor of Trinity County, even though the land was situated south of the 40th parallel and state law stated that lands south of that parallel belonged to Mendocino County. The appellate court upheld the ruling of the trial court since Section 10 of the special act of March 30, 1872 (Stats. 1871-2, p. 766), which concerned this boundary and was the act under which Fauntleroy acted under, authorized the survey of the theretofore unknown location of the 40th parallel north, stated that &quot;the lines run out, marked and defined as required by this act are hereby declared to be the true boundary lines of the counties named herein&quot;, thereby making the law in the political code which defined the boundary as the 40th parallel north only a suggestion and not a fact. The legislature subsequently affirmed this decision, with the modern statute defining the borders of the two counties referencing the survey of Fauntleroy as being the boundary between the two counties instead of the 40th parallel north.

=== Overview ===
Mendocino is a strongly Democratic county in presidential and congressional elections. The last Republican to win a majority in the county was Californian Ronald Reagan in 1984. However, in the 2016 election, Mendocino County gave Hillary Clinton a reduced margin of victory of any Democrat since Al Gore (though support for third-party candidates more than doubled from 2012). In 2020 the county was won by Joe Biden with an increased margin of victory from the previous election.

As of February 2021, the California Secretary of State reports that Mendocino County has 54,505 registered voters. Of those, 26,648 (48.9%) are registered Democratic; 11,387 (20.9%) are registered Republican; 4,389 (8.1%) are registered with other political parties, and 12,082 (22.1%) declined to state a political party.

In 2000, Mendocino County voters approved Measure G, which calls for the decriminalization of marijuana when used and cultivated for personal use. Measure G passed with a 58% majority vote, making it the first county in the United States to declare prosecution of small-scale marijuana offenses the &quot;lowest priority&quot; for local law enforcement. Measure G does not protect individuals who cultivate, transport or possess marijuana for sale. However, Measure G was passed at the local government level affecting only Mendocino County, and therefore does not affect existing state or federal laws. The city of Berkeley has had a similar law (known as the Berkeley Marijuana Initiative II) since 1979 which has generally been found to be unenforceable.

In 2008, the Mendocino County Board of Supervisors placed Measure B on the June 3 county-wide ballot. After three months of hard-fought campaigning and national attention, voters narrowly approved &quot;B&quot;, which repealed the provisions of 2000&#x27;s Measure G. However, opponents of Measure B intend to continue the challenge in court, as the wording of Measure B relies heavily on S.B. 420&#x27;s state limitations which were recently ruled unconstitutional by the California supreme court. On July 3, the Sheriff and District Attorneys offices announced that they would not be enforcing the new regulations for the time being, citing pending legal challenges and conflicts with existing state law.

In April 2009, Sheriff Tom Allman issued his department&#x27;s medical marijuana enforcement policy, which includes the provisions of Measure B and also cites the California Supreme Court Ruling narrowly defining &quot;caregiver&quot; in the state&#x27;s medical marijuana law.

In 2004, Measure H was passed in Mendocino County with a 56% majority, making it the first county in the United States to ban the production and cultivation of genetically modified organisms.

On November 4, 2008, Mendocino County voted 63.1% against Proposition 8 which amended the California Constitution to define marriage as a union between one man and one woman.

Since 1916, it has voted for the winner in each election except in 1956 when it voted for Adlai Stevenson II instead of Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1968 when it voted for Hubert Humphrey instead of Richard Nixon, and 2016 when it voted for Hillary Clinton instead of Donald Trump. In 2024, Donald Trump won the county in a slim victory, continuing the county&#x27;s bellwether county status.

Trump&#x27;s win in Merced county made it one of ten counties to flip from Biden to Trump, as well as making Merced one of six counties to vote for the Republican presidential candidate for the first time in 20 years since George W. Bush in 2004. Democrat Barack Obama won a majority in the county in both 2008 and 2012. Before that, Republican George W. Bush won a majority in the county in both 2000 and 2004.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

According to the California Secretary of State, as of October 20, 2008, there were 97,179 registered voters in Merced County. Of those, 44,704 (46.0%) are registered Democratic, 35,955 (37.0%) are registered Republican, 3,090 (3.2%) are registered with other political parties, and 13,430 (13.8%) declined to state a political party. Atwater and the county&#x27;s unincorporated areas have Republican plurality registration advantages. All of the other cities and towns in the county have Democratic pluralities or majorities in voter registration. Merced County has seen a rightward tilt in recent years, voting &quot;Yes&quot; in the 2021 gubernatorial recall election despite voting for Governor Gavin Newsom by a margin of 4% in 2018. The county then voted for Republican nominee Brian Dahle in 2022 over Newsom, as well as for all Republican nominees for statewide office.
