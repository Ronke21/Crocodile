<text>The garden pansy (Viola&quot; × &quot;wittrockiana) is a type of polychromatic large-flowered hybrid plant cultivated as a garden flower. It is derived by hybridization from several species in the section &quot;Melanium&quot; (&quot;the pansies&quot;) of the genus &quot;Viola&quot;, particularly &quot;V. tricolor&quot;, a wildflower of Europe and western Asia known as heartsease. It is sometimes known as &quot;V. tricolor&quot; var. &quot;hortensis&quot;, but this scientific name is suspect. While &quot;V. tricolor&quot; var. &quot;hortensis&quot; is a synonym of &quot;Viola&quot; × &quot;wittrockiana&quot;, &quot;V. tricolor&quot; var. &quot;hortensis&quot; refers to a horticultural variety of wild pansy (&quot;V. tricolor&quot; without interspecific hybridization) that had been illustrated in &quot;Flora Danica&quot; in 1777 before the existence of &quot;Viola&quot; × &quot;wittrockiana&quot;.

The chromosome number of &quot;Viola&quot; × &quot;wittrockiana&quot; is 2n = 44–52, with most cultivars being 2n = 48. The flower is in diameter and has two slightly overlapping upper petals, two side petals, and a single bottom petal with a slight beard emanating from the flower&#x27;s center. These petals are usually white or yellow, purplish, or blue. The plant may grow to in height, and prefers sun to varying degrees and well-draining soils.

== Terminology ==

English common names, such as &quot;pansy&quot;, &quot;viola&quot; and &quot;violet&quot; may be used interchangeably. One possible distinction is that plants considered to be &quot;pansies&quot; are classified in &quot;Viola&quot; sect. &quot;Melanium&quot;, and have four petals pointing upwards (the two side petals point upwards), and only one pointing down, whereas those considered to be &quot;violets&quot; are classified in &quot;Viola&quot; sect. &quot;Viola&quot;, and have two petals pointing up and three pointing down. Another possible distinction is made by the American Violet Society – the International Cultivar Registration Authority for the genus &quot;Viola&quot;. It divides cultivated varieties (cultivars) in &quot;Viola&quot; sect. &quot;Melanium&quot; into four subgroups: B1 – pansies, B2 – violas, B3 – violettas and B4 – cornuta hybrids. On this classification, modern &quot;pansies&quot; differ from the other three subgroups by possessing a well-defined &quot;blotch&quot; or &quot;eye&quot; in the middle of the flower.

Modern horticulturalists tend to use the term &quot;pansy&quot; for those multi-coloured large-flowered hybrids that are grown for bedding purposes every year, while &quot;viola&quot; is usually reserved for smaller, more delicate annuals and perennials.

=== Etymology ===
The name &quot;pansy&quot; is derived from the French word &quot;&quot;, &quot;thought&quot;, and was imported into Late Middle English as a name of &quot;Viola&quot; in the mid-15th century, as the flower was regarded as a symbol of remembrance. The name &quot;love in idleness&quot; implied the image of a lover who has little or no other employment than to think of his beloved.

The name &quot;heart&#x27;s-ease&quot; came from St. Euphrasia, whose name in Greek signifies cheerfulness of mind. The woman, who refused marriage and took the veil, was considered a pattern of humility, hence the name &quot;humble violet&quot;.

In Scandinavia, Scotland, and Germany, the pansy is known as the &quot;stepmother&quot; flower; an aitiological tale about a selfish stepmother is told to children while the teller plucks off corresponding parts of the blossom. The German name is &quot;&quot; (); in the German version of the tale, the lower petal represents the stepmother, the large upper petals represent her daughters, and the small upper petals represent her stepdaughters. The Czech name for the flower, &quot;maceška&quot;, also means &quot;little stepmother&quot; and is said to derive from the flower&#x27;s resemblance of an evil woman&#x27;s sullen face. In Slovenian, the flower is instead identified with an orphan.

In Italy, the pansy is known as &quot;flammola&quot; (little flame).

In Israel, the pansy is called Amnon Ve&#x27;Tamar, (אמנון ותמר), named after the rape story of Amnon and Tamar, in which Amnon raped his half-sister Tamar. The name was suggested by Shaul Tchernichovsky.

== Cultivation ==
=== Historical background ===
In the early 19th century, Lady Mary Elizabeth Bennet (1785–1861), daughter of Emma, Lady Tankerville and the Earl of Tankerville, collected and cultivated every sort of &quot;Viola tricolor&quot; (commonly, heartsease) she could procure in her father&#x27;s garden at Walton-upon-Thames, Surrey. Under the supervision of her gardener, William Richardson, a large variety of plants was produced via cross-breeding. In 1812, she introduced her pansies to the horticultural world, and, in 1813, Mr. Lee of Vineyard Nursery, a well-known florist and nurseryman, discovered her collection and further cultivated the flower. Other nurserymen followed Lee&#x27;s example, and the pansy became a favorite among the public.

About the same time that Lady Bennett was busy cultivating heartsease, James, Lord Gambier was doing the same in his garden at Iver under the advice and guidance of his gardener William Thompson. A yellow viola, &quot;Viola lutea&quot;, and a wide-petalled pale yellow species of Russian origin, &quot;Viola altaica&quot; were among the crosses that laid the foundation for the new hybrids classed as &quot;Viola&quot; × &quot;wittrockiana&quot;, named for the Swedish botanist Veit Brecher Wittrock (1839–1914). A round flower of overlapping petals was the aim of some early experimenters; in the late 1830s a chance sport that no longer had narrow nectar guides of dark color on the petals but a broad dark blotch on the petals (which came to be called the &quot;face&quot;), was found. It was developed in Gambier&#x27;s garden and released to the public in 1839 with the name &quot;Medora&quot;.

By 1833, there were 400 named pansies available to gardeners who once considered its progenitor, heartsease, a weed. Specific guidelines were formulated for show pansies but amateur gardeners preferred the less demanding fancy pansies. About this time, James Grieve developed the viola and Dr. Charles Stuart developed the violetta, both smaller, more compact plants than the pansy.

===Modern horticulture===

Modern horticulturists have developed a wide range of pansy flower colors and bicolors including yellow, gold, orange, purple, violet, red, white, and even near-black (very dark purple). Pansies typically display large showy face markings. The Joker Series has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

Plants grow well in sunny or partially sunny positions in well-draining soils. Pansies are perennial, but normally grown as biennials or annuals because of their leggy growth. The first year plant produces greenery, and bears flowers and seeds in its second year of growth. Afterwards, the plant dies like an annual. Because of selective human breeding, most garden pansies bloom the first year, some in as little as nine weeks after sowing. 

Pansies are purchased as six-packs or &quot;flats&quot; (US) of young plants from garden centers and planted directly into the garden soil. Plants will grow up to in height with flowers measuring in diameter, though smaller and larger flowering cultivars are available.

Pansies are winter hardy in zones 4–8. They can survive light freezes and short periods of snow cover, but, in areas with prolonged snow cover, a covering of a dry winter mulch is recommended. In warmer climates, USDA zones 9–11, pansies can bloom over the winter, and are often planted in the fall. In warmer zones, pansies may re-seed themselves and return the next year. They are not very heat-tolerant; warm temperatures inhibit blooming and hot muggy air causes rot and death. In colder zones, pansies may not survive without snow cover or protection (mulch) from extreme cold or periods of freezing and thawing. They perform best in zones with moderate temperatures, and equal amounts of mild rainfall and sunshine.

Pansies, for best growth, are watered thoroughly about once a week, depending on climate and rainfall. The plant should never be over-watered. To maximize blooming, plant foods are used about every other week, depending on the type of food used. Regular deadheading can extend the blooming period.

== Pests and diseases ==
=== Aphids ===
Aphids, which can spread the cucumber mosaic virus, sometimes feed on pansies.

=== Leaf spot ===
Leaf spot (&quot;Ramularia deflectens&quot;) is a fungal infection. Symptoms include dark spots on leaf margins followed by a white web covering the leaves. It is associated with cool damp springs.

=== Downy mildew ===
Pansy downy mildew is caused by the oomycete &quot;Peronospora violae&quot;, which produces purple-brown leaf spots, often with encircling yellowing, that have an accompanying grey mold on the leaf underside. It can severely weaken or kill affected plants.

=== Powdery mildew ===
A disease caused by one or more species of fungus in the Erysiphaceae family. Symptoms include violet-gray powder on fringes and underside of leaves. It is encouraged by stagnant air and can be limited but not necessarily eliminated by fungicide application.

=== Slugs and snails ===
Slugs and snails feed on the foliage.

=== Stem rot ===
Stem rot, also known as pansy sickness, is a soil-borne fungus and a possible hazard with unsterilized animal manure. The plant may collapse without warning in the middle of the season. The foliage will flag and lose color. Flowers will fade and shrivel prematurely. Stem will snap at the soil line if tugged slightly. The plant is probably a total loss unless tufted. The treatment of stem rot includes the use of fungicides such as Cheshunt or Benomyl, which are used prior to planting. Infected plants are destroyed (burned) to prevent the spread of the pathogen to other plants.

=== Cucumber mosaic virus ===
The cucumber mosaic virus is transmitted by aphids. Pansies with the virus have fine yellow veining on young leaves, stunted growth and anomalous flowers. The virus can lie dormant, affect the entire plant and be passed to next generations and to other species. Prevention is key: purchases should consist entirely of healthy plants.

== In culture ==

=== Symbolism ===
The pansy&#x27;s connection to pious humility is mentioned by Harte, who writes: &quot;From brute beasts humility I learned;/And in the pansy’s life God’s providence discerned&quot;.
Gifford evokes both Christian and classical undertones, writing how &quot;Pansies – still,/More blest than me, thus shall ye live/Your little day, – and when ye die,/Sweet flowers! The grateful muse/Shall give a verse&quot;.
Smart proposes &quot;Were it not for thee, oh sun,/Those pansies, that reclining from the bank/View through the immaculate, pellucid stream,/Their portraiture in the inverted Heaven,/Might as well change their triple boast, the white,/The purple, and the gold&quot;.

On account of its popularity in both society and its recurring appearances in Romantic poetry, a variety of new nicknames for the flower began to circulate. Dorothea Lynde Dix proclaims that “Perhaps no flower (not excepting even the queenly rose) claims to be so universal a favorite, as the viola tricolor; none currently has been honored with so rich a variety of names, at once expressive of grace, delicacy and tenderness.” Many of these names play on the whimsical nature of love, including “Three Faces under a Hood,” “Flame Flower,” “Jump Up and Kiss Me,” “Flower of Jove,” and “Pink of my John.”

In &quot;Hamlet&quot;, Ophelia distributes flowers with the remark, &quot;There&#x27;s pansies, that&#x27;s for thoughts&quot; (IV.5). Other poets referencing the pansy include Ben Jonson, Bernard Barton, Michael Drayton, Edmund Spenser, William Wakefield, and William Wordsworth.

Nathaniel Hawthorne published his last literary effort, an unfinished piece, entitled &quot;Pansie, a Fragment&quot;, sometimes called &quot;Little Pansie, a fragment&quot; in 1864.
D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Pansies: Poems by D. H. Lawrence&quot; was published in 1929, and Margaret Mitchell originally chose Pansy as the name of her &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; heroine, but settled on Scarlett just before the book went into print.

The word &quot;pansy&quot; has indicated an effeminate male since Elizabethan times and its usage as a disparaging term for a man or boy who is effeminate, as well as for an avowedly homosexual man, is still in use. The word &quot;ponce&quot; (which has now come to mean a pimp) and the adjective &quot;poncey&quot; (effeminate) also derive from &quot;pansy&quot;.

=== Visual arts ===
In the visual arts, Pierre-Joseph Redouté painted &quot;Bouquet of Pansies&quot; in 1827, and, in 1874, Henri Fantin-Latour painted &quot;Still Life with Pansies&quot;. In 1887, Vincent van Gogh painted &quot;Mand met viooltjes&quot;, and, in 1926, Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe created a painting of a black pansy called simply, &quot;Pansy&quot; and followed it with &quot;White Pansy&quot; in 1927. J. J. Grandville created a fantasy flower called Pensée in his &quot;Fleurs Animées&quot;.

=== As an emblem ===
Because its name means &quot;thought&quot;, the pansy was chosen as a symbol of Freethought and has been used in the literature of the American Secular Union. Humanists use it too, as the pansy&#x27;s current appearance was developed from the heartsease by two centuries of intentional crossbreeding of wild plant hybrids.
The specific colors of the flower – purple, yellow, and white – are meant to symbolize memories, loving thoughts and souvenirs, respectively.
The Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF) uses the pansy symbol extensively in its lapel pins and literature. The flower has long been associated with human manner, as one man cleverly stated: “Nature sports as much with the colours of this little flower as she does with the features of the human countenance.”

=== Traditions and uses ===
In William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, the &quot;juice of the heartsease&quot; is a love potion and &quot;on sleeping eyelids laid, will make a man or woman madly dote upon the next live creature that it sees.&quot; (II.1).

In the language of flowers, a honeyflower and a pansy left by a lover for his beloved means, &quot;I am thinking of our forbidden love&quot;. In 1858, the writer James Shirley Hibberd wrote that the French custom of giving a bride a bouquet of pansies (thoughts) and marigolds (cares) symbolized the woes of domestic life rather than marital bliss.

A German fable tells of how the pansy lost its perfume. Originally pansies would have been very fragrant, growing wild in fields and forests. It was said that people would trample the grass completely in eagerness to pick pansies. Unfortunately, the people’s cows were starving due to the ruined fields, so the pansy prayed to give up her perfume. Her prayer was answered, and without her perfumed scent, the fields grew tall, and the cows grew fat on the fresh green grass.

American pioneers thought that “a handful of violets taken into the farmhouse in the spring ensured prosperity, and to neglect this ceremony brought harm to baby chicks and ducklings.” On account of its place in American hearts, a game called “Violet War” also arose. In this game, two players would intertwine the hooks where the pansy blossoms meet the stems, then attempt to pull the two flowers apart like wishbones. Whoever pulled off the most of their opponent’s violet heads was proclaimed the winner. Young American settlers also made pansy dolls by lining up the pansy flower “faces”, pasting on leaf skirts and twig arms to complete the figures.

The pansy is also used in herbalism and traditional medicine.

In 1986, Ford Motor Company expanded its agricultural holdings when it purchased the Sperry-New Holland implement line from Sperry Corporation, and named their agricultural division Ford New Holland Inc. The following year, Versatile was purchased, giving Ford a complete agricultural lineup. In 1988 Ford Motor Company sold 80% of Ford-New Holland Inc. to Fiat, and in 1991 Fiat acquired the remaining 20%, with the agreement to stop using the Ford brand by 2000. By 1999, Fiat had discontinued the use of both its own and the Ford name, and united them both under the New Holland brand.

<text>Pontiac, or formally the Pontiac Motor Division of General Motors, was an American automobile brand owned, manufactured, and commercialized by General Motors. It was originally introduced as a companion make for GM&#x27;s more expensive line of Oakland automobiles. Pontiac quickly overtook Oakland in popularity and supplanted its parent entirely by 1933, in turn establishing its position as one of GM&#x27;s dominant divisions.

Sold in the United States, Canada, and Mexico by GM, Pontiac came to represent affordable, practical transportation with an emphasis on performance. The division’s name stems from the Odawa chieftain Pontiac, who led an indigenous uprising around the city of Detroit from 1763 to 1766.

In the hierarchy of GM&#x27;s five divisions, it slotted above Chevrolet but below Oldsmobile, Buick, and Cadillac. Starting with the 1959 models, marketing was focused on selling the lifestyle that the car&#x27;s ownership promised rather than the car itself. By emphasizing its &quot;Wide Track&quot; design, Pontiac billed itself as the &quot;performance division&quot; of General Motors that marketed cars with the &quot;we build excitement&quot; tag line.

Facing financial problems in the late 2000s and a need to restructure, as a prequisite for a $53 billion government bailout, GM agreed to discontinue the Pontiac brand; the final Pontiac, a white G6, was assembled on January 4, 2010. Franchise agreements for Pontiac dealers expired on October 31, 2010, leaving GM to focus on its four remaining North American brands: Chevrolet, Buick, Cadillac, and GMC.

==History==
=== 1926–1942 ===

The Oakland Motor Car Company was founded in 1907 in Pontiac, Michigan, by Edward Murphy, a manufacturer of horse-drawn carriages. The following year, another former buggy company executive, William C. Durant, founded General Motors in Flint, Michigan, as a holding company for the Buick Motor Company. GM soon bought other automakers, including Oldsmobile and Cadillac. In 1909, Oakland became part of GM. The first model made its debut as the Oakland Four from 1909 until it was replaced by the Oakland Six in 1916. In 1926 the Pontiac Series 6-27 was introduced as a junior brand to Oakland, which featured a six-cylinder engine. The Pontiac was more popular than the senior brand and became its own GM division when Oakland was canceled in 1931.

It was named after the famous Odawa chief, who had also given his name to the city of Pontiac, Michigan, where the car was produced. Within months of its introduction, Pontiac was outselling Oakland. Body styles offered included a sedan with both two and four doors, Landau Coupe, with the Sport Phaeton, Sport Landau Sedan, Sport Cabriolet, and Sport Roadster. As a result of Pontiac&#x27;s rising sales, versus Oakland&#x27;s declining sales, Pontiac became the only companion marque to survive its parent, with Oakland ceasing production in 1932.

Pontiacs were also manufactured from knock-down kits at GM&#x27;s Japanese factory at Osaka Assembly in Osaka, Japan, from 1927 until 1941.

Pontiac produced cars offering , (3.25×3.75 in, 82.5×95mm) L-head straight-six cylinder engines in the Pontiac Series 6-27 of 1927; its stroke was the shortest of any American car in the industry at the time. The Series 6-27 sold 39,000 units within six months of its appearance at the 1926 New York Auto Salon, hitting 76,742 in 12 months. The next year, 1928, it became the top-selling six-cylinder car in the U.S., as well as ranking seventh in overall sales. When the Wall Street Crash of 1929 occurred in September, both Pontiac and Oakland sales dropped dramatically and because Oakland was the more expensive, GM leadership decided that Pontiac should remain.

1932 was the first year for the Pontiac Series 302 V8. The 1932 V8 had an oversquare bore and stroke of x displacing with a compression ratio of 5.2:1. Horsepower was rated at @3200 RPM using three main bearings, solid valve lifters and a Marvel one-barrel carburetor. Unusually, Pontiac switched to the straight-eight for 1933 until it was replaced in 1954.

As the economy began to recover, by 1933, Pontiac had moved up to producing the least expensive cars available with straight-eight engines. This was achieved by using many components from the six-cylinder Chevrolet Master, such as the body. The Pontiacs were differentiated by a large chrome strip on the top and center of the front hood that Pontiac called the &quot;Silver Streak&quot;. Only eight-cylinder engines were offered in 1933 and 1934, displacing rated at .

In 1935, Pontiac shared the &quot;torpedo&quot; body appearance with the LaSalle and the Cadillac Series 60, just prior to its being used by Chevrolet, earning some media attention for the marque. At the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair, a 1939 Deluxe Six was displayed with body panels made entirely from plexiglass. An unusual feature of the &quot;torpedo&quot;-bodied exhibition car was that, with the push of a button, the front half of the body would open showing the engine and the car&#x27;s front seat interior.


A major change occurred in 1937, when all Pontiac models except the new station wagon began using the all-steel B-body shared with Oldsmobile, LaSalle, and small Buicks. A new stronger X frame had a Hotchkiss drive using a two-part drive shaft. The eight-cylinder had a wheelbase, while the six-cylinder had a wheelbase. Both engines increased displacements with the six going to producing and the eight to rated at .

From 1940 through 1942, the Pontiac Torpedo was the brand&#x27;s only model built on three different bodies: the &quot;A&quot; body shared with Chevrolet, the &quot;B&quot; body shared with Oldsmobile and Buick, and the &quot;C&quot; body shared with the large Oldsmobile, Buick, and the small Cadillac. It shared some appearances with the Opel Kapitän. In 1941 the Pontiac Streamliner appeared with a straight-8 engine, and on February 2, 1942, the last civilian Pontiac automobile was manufactured in the United States, as all automobile factories converted to military production.

The prewar through the early 1950s Pontiacs were not powerful as they featured the heavy and long Pontiac straight-8 engine, which was less expensive to produce than the increasingly popular V8s. Their long crankshaft suffered from excessive flex, thus limiting them to a low compression ratio with a modest redline.

=== 1946–1954 ===
From 1946 until 1948, all Pontiac models were essentially 1942 models with minor changes. The Hydramatic automatic transmission was introduced in 1948 and helped Pontiac sales grow even though their cars, Torpedoes, and Streamliners, were becoming out of date.

The first all-new Pontiac models appeared in 1949. They incorporated styling cues such as lower body lines and rear fenders that were integrated into the rear-end styling of the car. The Chieftain line was introduced to replace the Torpedo. Built on the GM B-body platform, the Chieftain featured different styling from the Streamliner. In 1950, the Catalina pillarless hardtop coupe was introduced as a &quot;halo&quot; model, similar to the Chevrolet Bel Air of the same year.

In 1952, Pontiac discontinued the Streamliner and replaced it with additional models in the Chieftain line built on the GM A-body platform. This single model line continued until 1954 when the Star Chief was added. The Star Chief featured a stretch to the A-body platform giving it a wheelbase.

The 1953 models were the first to have one-piece windshields instead of the previous two-piece units. While the 1953 and 1954 models were heavily reworked versions of the 1949-52 Chieftain models, they were engineered for the V8 engine that was supposed to be introduced on the 1953 models, but the Buick division complained to GM&#x27;s management that the introduction might take sales away because Buick was introducing the new nailhead V8 in 1953.

In 1954, Pontiac continued to build upon the design and engineering of their vehicles, which had seen significant updates in previous years. While the 1953 and 1954 models were reworked versions of the 1949-1952 Chieftain models, the year 1954 brought a unique marketing strategy to the forefront. Pontiac introduced an advertising campaign that featured striking prints depicting the impressive feats of Native American tribes. These prints showcased various aspects of tribal life, from awe-inspiring acts of construction to hunting and other means of survival. The campaign not only highlighted the rich heritage and craftsmanship of Native American cultures but also added an element of cultural resonance to the Pontiac brand, creating a unique and memorable connection with potential customers.

=== 1955–1960 ===

Completely new bodies and chassis were introduced for the 1955 model year and sales increased. A new overhead-valve Strato Streak V8 engine was introduced. With the introduction of this V8, the six-cylinder engines were discontinued; a six-cylinder would not return to the full-size Pontiac line until the GM corporate downsizing of 1977.

In 1956, when Semon &quot;Bunkie&quot; Knudsen became general manager of Pontiac, alongside new heads of engineering, E. M. Estes and John DeLorean, Knudsen began reworking the brand&#x27;s image. One of the first steps involved the removal of the &quot;silver streaks&quot; from the hood and deck lid which were a traditional styling feature beginning in 1933. These were eliminated from the 1957 models just weeks before they were introduced. The first Bonneville was also introduced. This was a version of the Star Chief convertible to showcase Pontiac&#x27;s first fuel-injected engine. About 630 Bonnevilles were built in 1957. Pontiac marketing described it as &quot;America&#x27;s No. 1 Road Car&quot;.

The following year, the Bonneville became its own line, built on the wheelbase of the A-body platform. A 1958 Tri power Bonneville was the pace car for that year&#x27;s Indianapolis 500. The 1958 model year was final use of the &quot;Indian&quot; motif throughout the vehicle. The only exception would be the Indian head high-beam indicator light in the instrument cluster. All 1958 models featured ball joint front suspension replacing the previous kingpin design.

With the 1959 model year, Pontiac came out with its &quot;Arrowhead&quot; emblem, with the star design in the middle. The &quot;Arrowhead&quot; design ran all the way up the hood from between the split grille, and on Star Chief models, had eight chrome stars from the emblem design on the body sides as chrome trim. Knudsen directed that the Pontiacs received a completely reworked chassis, body, and interior styling. Quad headlamps, as well as a longer, lower body, were some of the styling changes.

The Chieftain line was renamed Catalina; the Star Chief was downgraded to replace the discontinued Super Chief series and for the first time did not have a two-door hardtop, only a two-door sedan along with a four-door hardtop and four-door sedan; in addition, there was no Star Chief wagon. The Bonneville was now the top of the line, coming in three body styles: a two-door hardtop, a four-door hardtop, and a four-door station wagon. The Star Chief&#x27;s four-door &quot;Vista&quot; hardtop was also shared by the Bonneville. Catalina models included a two-door hardtop, two-door sedan, four-door sedan, and four-door hardtop as well as two station wagons, a six-passenger with two rows of seats, and a nine-passenger version with a rear-facing third row. Bonneville and Star Chief were built on a wheelbase with the exception of the Bonneville wagon, and all Catalina models and the Bonneville wagon rode on a wheelbase. Catalina was also shorter than Bonneville and Star Chief and weighed less than its long-wheelbase counterparts. All 1959 Pontiacs were equipped with a V8 engine with horsepower ratings from to a &quot;Tri-power&quot; carbureted version. All automatics were four-speed Super-Hydra-Matics or, as the Hydramatic Division that designed and built them called them, &quot;Controlled coupling HydraMatic&quot;. Oldsmobile used this same transmission and called it Jetaway Hydramatic; Cadillac also used it and called it 315 or P 315 Hydramatic. A three-speed, column-mounted stick shift was standard on all Pontiacs. This coincided with major body styling changes across all models that introduced increased glass area, twin V-shaped fins, and lower hood profiles. &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine selected the Pontiac line as the 1959 Car of the Year. The 1959s featured a wider track. The increase to was because Knudsen noticed the new, wider bodies looked awkward on the carried-over 1958 frames. The new &quot;Wide-Track&quot; Pontiacs improved styling, handled better, and contributed to Pontiac&#x27;s resurgence in the marketplace.

The 1960 models had a complete reskinning with the exception of the body&#x27;s canopies, which remained identical to the 1959s, but removed the tail fins and the distinctive split grille. The 1960 models&#x27; standard engine had a power gain of 3 hp due to a compression increase of .25. The Ventura was introduced, and a more luxurious hardtop coupe with the four-door hardtop built on the shorter wheelbase platform, thus positioned between the Catalina and Star Chief models. The Ventura featured the luxury features of the Bonneville in the shorter, lighter Catalina body.

=== 1961–1970 ===

Most of Pontiac&#x27;s models built during the 1960s and 1970s were either styled like or were siblings with other GM makes (except Cadillac). Pontiac retained its own front- and rear-end styling, interiors, and engines.

The 1961 models were restyled. The split grille returned, as well as all-new bodies and a new design of a perimeter-frame chassis for all its full-size models (something which would be adopted for all of GM&#x27;s intermediate-sized cars in 1964, and all its full-sized cars in 1965). These new chassis allowed for reduced weight and smaller body sizes. The similarly styled Chevrolet still used the &quot;X&quot; frame from the early 1960s.

A new compact Tempest was introduced for the 1961 model year. It was one of the three Buick-Olds-Pontiac (BOP) models introduced that year, sharing the platform with the Buick Special, Skylark, and Oldsmobile F-85. A four-cylinder engine was also introduced in the Tempest model line.

All three BOP cars were unibody, dubbed the Y-body platform, combining the frame and body into a single construction, making them comparatively lighter and smaller. All three put into production new technology pushed by John DeLorean, on which GM had been working for several years prior, but the Tempest was by far the most radical. A flexible steel shaft rotating at the speed of the engine delivered power from the front-mounted engine through a &quot;torque tube&quot; to a rear-mounted transaxle. This provided close to a 50/50 front-rear weight distribution that improved handling as well as incorporated four-wheel independent suspension. The design almost eliminated the large floor &quot;hump&quot; common to front-engined, rear-drive cars.

Though the Tempest&#x27;s transaxle was similar to the one in the Corvair, introduced the year before, it shared essentially no common parts. GM had planned to launch a Pontiac version of the Corvair (dubbed &quot;Polaris&quot;), but Bunkie Knudsen—whose niece had been seriously injured in a Corvair crash—successfully argued against the idea. The Polaris design apparently made it to full-scale clay before it was canceled. Instead, DeLorean&#x27;s &quot;rope-shaft&quot; design was green-lighted.

The Tempest won the &quot;Motor Trend&quot; &quot;Car of the Year&quot; award in 1961. Toward the end of 1961, an upscale version of the Tempest called the LeMans was introduced.

The Tempest featured a inline slant-four cylinder engine, derived from the right bank of Pontiac&#x27;s 389 V8, enabling it to be run down the same production line and reducing costs. the engine received a crankshaft designed for four cylinders, but this did not completely solve its balance issues. The engine gained the nickname &quot;Hay Baler&quot; because of its tendency to kick violently, like the farm machine.

An optional Buick V8, was not popular when it was available for 1961 and 1962 in the Tempest. For 1963, Pontiac replaced it with a new &quot;326&quot; that was actually V8 with a bore of 3.78 and stroke of 3.75 (same stroke as the 389). It was based and shared parts with the 389, but an altered, reduced bore. The car&#x27;s body and suspension were also changed to be lower, longer, and wider. The response was that more than half of the 1963 Tempests and LeMans (separate lines for that one year only) were ordered with the V8. The next year, the 326 became a true 326 with a new bore size of 3.72. The Tempest&#x27;s popularity helped move Pontiac into third place among American car brands in 1962, a position Pontiac would hold through 1970.

In November 1961, Knudsen moved to Chevrolet. Pete Estes now became general manager of Pontiac and DeLorean was promoted to Pontiac chief engineer. Both continued Knudsen&#x27;s work of making Pontiac a performance-car brand. Pontiac capitalized on the emerging trend toward sportier bucket-seat coupes in 1962 by introducing the Grand Prix, taking the place of the Ventura, which now became a trim option on the Catalina. Although GM officially ended factory support for all racing activities across all of its brands in January 1963, Pontiac continued making larger engines with more power available across all model lines.

For 1963, the Grand Prix received the same styling changes as other full-sized Pontiacs such as vertical headlights and new body lines with a squared-off roofline with a concave rear window, along with less chrome. The concave rear window was replicated on Tempest/LeMans four-door intermediates in 1964 and 1965.

For 1964, the Tempest and LeMans&#x27; transaxle design was dropped and the cars were redesigned under GM&#x27;s new A-body platform - frame cars with a conventional front-engined, rear-wheel drive layout. The most important of these is the GTO. In spite of a GM unwritten edict against engines larger than in intermediate cars, DeLorean (with support from Jim Wangers from Pontiac&#x27;s ad agency), came up with the idea to offer the GTO as an option package that included a engine rated at .

The entire Pontiac lineup was selected as Motor Trend&#x27;s Car of the Year for 1965, the third time Pontiac received this recognition. The February 1965 issue of Motor Trend was almost entirely devoted to Pontiac&#x27;s Car of the Year award and included feature stories on the division&#x27;s marketing, styling, engineering, and performance efforts along with road tests of several models. The GTO was split from being an option on the Tempest LeMans series to becoming a separate GTO series.

The 1966 model year saw the introduction of a completely new overhead camshaft (OHC) 6-cylinder engine in the Tempest. The 1962 Jeep Tornado engine was the first post-World War II U.S.-designed mass-produced OHC engine while the Pontiac OHC I6 was available in popular-priced domestic cars. In an industry first, plastic grilles were used on several models.

The 1967 model year saw the introduction of the Pontiac Firebird pony car, a variant of the Chevrolet Camaro. Intermediate-sized cars (Tempest, LeMans, GTO) were mildly face-lifted, but all full-size cars and GTO lost their Tri-Power engine option, though they did get a larger V8 that replaced the previous 389. Full-sized cars got a major facelift with rounder wasp-waisted body lines, a name change for the mid-line series from Star Chief to Executive as well as a one-year-only Grand Prix convertible.

1968 introduced the Endura &#x27;rubber&#x27; front bumper on the GTO, the precursor to modern cars&#x27; integrated bumpers, and the first of a series of &quot;Ram Air&quot; engines, which featured the induction of cold air to the carburetor for more power. The Tri carburetor deletion came from the 14th floor of GM banning multiple carburetions and was headed by GM president Ed Cole. The Ram Air V option was not popular. Full-sized cars and intermediates reverted from vertical to horizontal headlights while the 2+2 was dropped from the lineup.

For 1969, Pontiac moved the Grand Prix from the full-sized lineup into a G-body model of its own based on the A-body intermediate four-door modified from to wheelbase chassis, but with different styling and long hood/short deck proportions to compete in the intermediate-sized personal luxury car segment. Pete Estes, who like Knudsen had moved to be general manager of Chevrolet in 1966, and DeLorean, general manager of the Pontiac division, needed a car to take the place of the sagging sales of the full-size Grand Prix, but the development cost of the car was too much of burden for Pontiac division alone, so Delorean went to his old boss at Chevrolet to gather support for the development cost of the new &quot;G&quot; body Grand Prix. Estes agreed to share in the cost and allow Pontiac to have a one-year exclusivity on this new car; the next year Chevy would follow with its version which was called Chevrolet Monte Carlo. The new Grand Prix was such a sales success in 1969 as dealers moved 112,000 units - more than four times the number of Grand Prixs sold in 1968. Full-sized Pontiacs were also restyled but retained the same basic under-body structure and chassis that debuted with the 1965 model — the roof-lines for the four-door pillared sedans and Safari wagons were the same as the 1965 models, while the two-door semi-fastback design gave way to a squared-off notch-back style and four-door hardtop sedans were also more squared off than 1967 and 1968 models. The GTOs and Firebirds received the Ram Air option, the GTO saw the addition of the &quot;Judge&quot; performance/appearance package, and the Firebird also got the &quot;Trans Am&quot; package. Although originally conceived as a model to compete in the Trans Am racing series, in a cost-saving move the Pontiac Trans Am debuted with the standard engines. This year also saw DeLorean leaving the post of general manager to accept a similar position at GM&#x27;s Chevrolet division. His replacement was F. James McDonald.

Pontiacs built in the late 1960s conformed to new U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. These included energy-absorbing interior parts such as steering columns, steering wheels, knobs and handles, dual-circuit hydraulic brake systems, shoulder belts, side marker lights, and headrests.

The 1969 Firebirds received a heavy facelift but otherwise continued much the same as the original 1967 model. It was the final year for the overhead cam six-cylinder engine in Firebirds and intermediates, and the Firebird convertible (until 1991). Production of the 1969 Firebirds was extended into the first three months of the 1970 model year (all other 1970 Pontiacs debuted September 18, 1969) due to a decision to delay the introduction of an all-new 1970 Firebird (and Chevrolet Camaro) until February 26, 1970.

In addition in the late-1960s, GM directed their GM and Pontiac divisions to develop concept mini-cars called &quot;commuter cars&quot; for urban drivers. GM developed a gasoline-electric drive hybrid, the XP-833, and the Pontiac X-4, a rear-wheel drive mid-engine car that was powered by a radical X-shaped aircraft type air-cooled two-stroke radial engine where the standard crankshaft was replaced by a unit called a Scotch yoke. While the GM car was fully tested, the Pontiac concept was not. Neither was placed in production.

=== 1970–1982 ===
Increasing insurance and fuel costs for owners decreased demand for muscle cars, along with federal emissions and safety regulations, put an end to the unrestricted, powerful engines of the 1960s. Safety, luxury, and economy would become the new watchwords of this decade. Engine performance began declining in 1971 when GM mandated that all engines be capable of using lower-octane unleaded gasoline, which led to drops in compression ratios, along with performance and fuel economy. This, coupled with trying to build cars as plush as GM&#x27;s more luxurious Buicks and Oldsmobiles, contributed to the start of Pontiac&#x27;s slow decline from its late-1960s highs.

In mid-1971 Pontiac introduced the compact, budget-priced Ventura II (based on the third generation Chevrolet Nova). This same year, Pontiac completely revamped its full-size car lineup. The flagship Bonneville was replaced with the more opulent Grand Ville, while a new generation of full-size Safari station wagons was introduced. These wagons featured a new tailgate known as a &#x27;Clamshell&#x27; design; rather than swing upward or outward, the steel portion of the tailgate lowered into the body below the cargo floor and the rear window raised into the roof. The design featured a power-operated glass and either a manual or power-assist tailgate. The power tailgate, the first in station wagon history, ultimately supplanted the manual tailgate, which required marked effort to lift from storage.

The 1972 models saw the first wave of emissions reduction and safety equipment and updates. GTO was a now sub-series of the LeMans. The Tempest was discontinued, after being renamed &#x27;T-37&#x27; and &#x27;GT-37&#x27; for 1971. The base 1972 mid-sized Pontiac was now called LeMans. James MacDonald left the post of general manager to be replaced by Martin J. Caserio in late 1972. Caserio was the first manager in over a decade to be more focused on marketing and sales than on performance.

For 1973, Pontiac followed suit with the rest of the General Motors divisions and introduced their variants of the all-new GM &quot;A&quot; body, known as the &#x27;Colonnade&#x27; style due to the roof treatment&#x27;s pillared look. &quot;A&quot; body Pontiac models included the mid-sized LeMans and all-new Grand Am as part of the LeMans line. The compact Ventura and personal-luxury Grand Prix were also restyled for 1973. Other models, including the big cars and Firebirds, received only minor updates.

Again, power dropped across all engines as more emissions requirements came into effect. The 1973 Firebird Trans Am&#x27;s factory-applied hood decal, a John Schinella stylized interpretation of Native American bird designs, took up most of the available space on the hood. Also in 1973, the new Super Duty 455 engine (&quot;Super Duty&quot; harkening back to Pontiac&#x27;s Racing Engines) was introduced. Although it was originally to be available in GTOs and Firebirds, only a few SD 455 engines made it into Firebird Trans Ams that year. One so equipped was tested by &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine, which proclaimed it the last of the fast cars. The SD 455 was available for one more year in the Trans Am.

As emissions regulations were increasing, two of the three iterations of the engine were discontinued after 1974, with the final version of the 455 remaining available through 1976.


For 1975, Pontiac introduced the new sub-compact Astre, a version of the Chevrolet Vega. This was the brand&#x27;s entry into the fuel economy segment of the market. Astre had been sold exclusively in Canada since 1973. It was offered through the 1977 model year. 1975 would also be the end of Pontiac convertibles for the next decade.

The 1976 models were the last of the traditional American large cars powered by mostly big-block V8 engines. After this year, all GM full-size models would go through &quot;downsizing&quot; and shrink in length, width, weight, and available engine size. The 1976 Sunbird, based on the Chevrolet Vega and Monza&#x27;s equivalent, joined the line. It was first offered as a Notchback, with a Hatchback body style added in 1977. The Vega Wagon body style was added in 1978, Sunbird Safari Wagon, replacing the Astre Safari Wagon. The Sunbird was offered in its rear-wheel-drive configuration through the 1980 model year. (Sunbird Safari wagon through 1979.)

For the 1977 model year, the full-sized Pontiacs received the same &quot;downsizing&quot; as GM&#x27;s other &quot;B&quot; body cars. The Grand Ville was dropped, but the new Bonnevilles and Catalinas continued to be best-sellers, although their styling shared more similarity to the Chevrolet Caprice than ever before.

In mid-year 1977, Pontiac introduced the Phoenix, an upscale version of the Ventura which replaced the Ventura entirely after the end of the 1977 model year. Pontiac also introduced its &quot;Iron Duke&quot; 4-cylinder overhead valve engine. It was first used in the 1977 Astre, replacing Astre&#x27;s aluminum-block Vega engine. The &#x27;Iron Duke&#x27; engine would later go into many GM and non-GM automobiles into the early 1990s. The 151 cubic inch I4 and the V8 were the last two engines designed solely by Pontiac. Subsequent engine design would be accomplished by one central office with all designs being shared by each brand.

The remainder of the 1970s and the early 1980s saw luxury, safety, and economy becoming ever-more important selling points in Pontiac products. Wire-spoked wheel covers returned for the first time since the 1930s. More station wagons than ever were being offered. Padded vinyl roofs were options on almost every model. Rear-wheel drive began its slow demise with the introduction of the first front-wheel drive Pontiac, the 1980 Phoenix (a version of the Chevrolet Citation).

The Firebird was successfully marketed by product placement in the &#x27;Smokey and the Bandit&#x27; film and The Rockford Files TV show. The Firebird was available with Formula and Trans Am packages, and a turbocharged V8—a Pontiac first—was also available for the 1980 and 1981 model years.

=== 1982–1988 ===

Introduced in 1982, the wedge-shaped Firebird was introduced, marking the first major redesign of the pony car since 1970. Embedded marketing in the television series Knight Rider was successful. Pontiac introduced more performance-oriented models over the next decade. The Trans Am also set a production aerodynamic mark of .32 cd. A convertible body style was reintroduced after nine years. GM adapted the J-body cars and the all-new 1982 J2000 (later renamed Sunbird) had a convertible as part of its line.
The 1984 Fiero was a major departure from anything Pontiac had produced in the past. A two-seat, mid-engined coupe. The Fiero was partially responsible for Pontiac seeing its first increase in sales in four years. Pontiac also began to focus on technology. In 1984, a Special Touring Edition (STE) was added to the 6000 line as a competitor to European road cars such as the Mercedes 190. The STE sported digital instruments and other electronics as well as a more powerful V6 and retuned suspension. Later iterations would see some of the first introductions on Pontiacs of anti-lock brakes, steering wheel-mounted radio controls, and other features.

Pontiac imported the Canadian market Pontiac Parisienne, which featured the Bonneville&#x27;s deluxe trim. This car, although a Pontiac in name, was no more than a slightly re-trimmed Caprice. The Parisienne sold in profitable numbers and this car continued in production until 1986 for the sedan, and 1989 for the Safari station wagon.

With the exception of the Parisienne Safari, the Firebird, and Fiero, beginning in 1988 all Pontiacs, with the exception of the Firebird, switched to front-wheel drive platforms. For the first time since 1970, Pontiac was the number three domestic car maker in America. The median age of Pontiac owners dropped from 46 in 1981 to 38 in 1988.

=== 1989–1997 ===
Pontiacs introduction included anti-lock brakes, GM&#x27;s Quad-4 engine, airbags, and composite materials. Safari station wagon production ended in 1989, the last V8-powered full-sized, rear-wheel drive Pontiac until the 2009 G8. The 1990 model year saw the launch of Pontiac&#x27;s first minivan and light truck, the Trans Sport. In addition, the Grand Prix line added its first-ever 4-door model, offered in LE and STE trims. At the end of the 1991 model year, the 6000 was discontinued in favor of the newly expanded Grand Prix lineup and the new Trans Sport minivan, which replaced the 6000 station wagon.

In 1992, a brand-new Bonneville was introduced. This full-size model featured aerodynamic styling, large expanses of curved glass, front-wheel drive, and the 3800 Series I V6 as standard equipment. A new sub-model, the SSEi, was introduced in 1992 carrying all standard equipment from the SSE model, plus the 205 hp supercharged 3800 V6. For 1993, the Bonneville added a new option package (H4U) called the Sport Luxury Edition (SLE), which was available on the SE model. This package included leather bucket seats, a specific grille, side trim, exhaust, dash trim, lace-styled alloy wheels, as well as a rear spoiler, sport handling suspension systems, and anti-lock brakes.

An all-new Firebird was introduced in 1993. It was powered by either a 3.4 L V6 with , or in Trans Am guise a LT-1, a V8, and could be backed by a T-56 six-speed manual. The Sunbird was replaced with the (still J-body) Sunfire in 1995. While a V6 engine was no longer available in the J-car, sedan, coupe, and convertible body styles did survive. For 1996 the Bonneville received updated front and rear fascias along with several other enhancements. The 3800 Series II V6 had become standard in 1995, featuring 205 hp. The updated supercharged 3800 Series II was now rated at 240 hp.

Division Sales Figures
=== 1997–2004 ===

The 1996 model year was the last year for the fifth-generation Grand Prix. The Grand Prix debuted in 1997 with the &quot;Wider is Better&quot; advertising campaign. The GTP trim level was added to the Grand Prix. It featured a supercharged 3.8 L V6 rated at and of torque. One design highlight of this generation Grand Prix is the sharing of the roof&#x27;s sheet metal between both coupe and sedan models.

In 1998 the Firebird was updated. The TransAm received the LS-1 motor which produced . The WS6 option saw this number increase to and the addition of Ram Air and stiffer springs. The 1999 model year saw the replacement of the Trans Sport with the larger Montana minivan.

In 2000, the Bonneville received the first major redesign since 1992 and was based on the G-Body, shared with the Oldsmobile Aurora and Buick LeSabre. In 2001 Pontiac introduced the Aztek into the emerging SUV market segment.

In 2002, both the Firebird/Trans Am and Camaro were discontinued as a result of declining sales and a saturated sports market. The coupe version of the Grand Prix was also discontinued. The 2003 Vibe arrived in spring 2002, a Toyota-based compact wagon built at the NUMMI joint-venture plant. Also, in 2003, it was announced that the Grand Prix would be in the last year of its generation, with an improved seventh generation on the way for 2004. It would also be Pontiac&#x27;s final year in NASCAR. Pontiac&#x27;s final victory in the NASCAR Cup Series would be achieved by Ricky Craven in one of the closest finishes in NASCAR history, with David Green scoring their last second-tier series win at the Mr. Goodcents 300 at Kansas Speedway. A few surplus Pontiacs continued running in the Busch Series through 2006, in the ARCA Racing Series through 2008, with factory support in the NASCAR Canadian Tire Series from 2007 to 2009, and in the NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour as late as 2019, nine years after the marque went defunct; Pontiac cars can still be found in local and regional stock car leagues.

2004 saw the reintroduction of the Pontiac GTO (based on the Australian-developed Holden Monaro). The GTO was also initially powered by the 350 HP LS-1 V8 in its first model year. It had an independent front and rear suspension and an upscale full leather interior. Sales did not reach the 18,000 units that GM predicted. The LS1 engine was retired in 2004. Pontiac added the drive-by-wire 400 HP LS2 V8 for the 2005 and 2006 model years at no additional cost. Additional upgrades also consisted of stainless steel dual exhaust outlets, larger Corvette-sourced PBR brakes with EBD, larger front vented rotors with vented rear rotors, and functional heat extractor hood scoops. The Bonneville introduced the GXP trim level to replace the SSEi. The Bonneville GXP featured a 4.6 Northstar V8, borrowed from Cadillac, and replaced the Supercharged 3800 Series II. The redesigned Grand Prix made its appearance and featured a GT and GTP trim level. The GTP&#x27;s new 3.8 L supercharged V6 now made , up 20 from the previous generation. TAPshift was also introduced as well as a Competition Group package (Comp G).

=== 2005–2010 ===
With the discontinuation of Oldsmobile in 2004, Pontiac went through a complete product revamping through this period. The Grand Am was replaced with the mid-size G6 in 2005. The Grand Am was produced for the 2005 model year to fill the gap until the new G6 coupe and convertible became available for that model year. The Bonneville ended production in 2005 after nearly 50 years of production. Although it was not directly replaced, the RWD G8 introduced for the 2008 model year did fill some of the market voids. The Solstice concept shown in 2002 was approved for production as a roadster (2006-2009) and, for a few months, a total of 1,266 coupes (2009) were built in Wilmington, DE before the end of Pontiac. In contrast, over 64,000 Solstice Convertibles were manufactured on that same line. The controversial and slow-selling Aztek was finally phased out and replaced by the Torrent, which was identical to the Chevrolet Equinox.

In 2005 the Sunfire was discontinued and replaced by the new Pontiac Pursuit (later named G5 for the American market). Initially, Pontiac did not plan on offering the G5 in the United States, however, dealer pressure to fill the gap left by the discontinuation of the Sunfire caused Pontiac to introduce only the coupe variation into the U.S. The 4-door sedan version was available in Canada as the Pursuit throughout the model run. The high-performance GXP trim was introduced in the Grand Prix line in 2005, adding GM&#x27;s LS4 V8 engine that produced 303 horsepower and 323 lb. ft. of torque. This engine was built to give buyers a V8 sedan option until the all-new G8 arrived in 2008. In 2008, the Grand Prix ended production, and the launch of the Australian-built RWD G8 commenced. The G8 gained positive reception for its high performance and low costs. Many noted the G8 as the poor man&#x27;s BMW M5, due to its similar performance at a much cheaper price. The G8 GXP was the most powerful production car Pontiac had ever built and is regarded as the best driver&#x27;s car ever to wear the Pontiac badge. The Holden Ute was scheduled to be launched as the G8 ST before it was canceled in January 2009 due to GM&#x27;s financial situation. It was later announced that the G8 may not see a second generation. Towards the end of the decade, many rumors began spreading that Pontiac would become completely reliant on RWD. Reports ranged from a compact sedan based on the Alpha platform to a new RWD G6 for the 2013 model year. Many reports suggested that the Trans Am/Firebird would return after GM confirmed the rebirth of the Camaro, however, no reports confirmed this.

On December 2, 2008, General Motors announced that it was considering eliminating numerous brands, including Pontiac, in order to appease Congress in hope of receiving a $25 billion loan. On February 17, 2009, GM proposed the sale or elimination of its Saturn division, the sale of Saab, and either the sale or elimination of Hummer, depending on whether a buyer could be found quickly. GM clarified that Pontiac would have begun to focus on &quot;niche&quot; models aimed at the &quot;youthful and sporty&quot; segment, but did not provide specifics. Pontiac was to trim its number of models to four, although there was talk of retaining only one model. By April 2009 several automotive websites and business publications were reporting that GM was doing a study suggesting it might eliminate the brand altogether, along with sister truck brand GMC. On April 23 a report was published stating the company would be dropping the Pontiac brand while preserving the GMC truck line, and the Chevrolet, Cadillac, and Buick brands. The decision to dissolve Pontiac was made primarily due to the increasing threat of a bankruptcy filing if the June 1 deadline could not be met. On April 27, 2009, GM announced that Pontiac would be dropped and that all of its remaining models would be phased out by the end of 2010. Though both production and franchise agreements ended in 2010, Pontiac remains a registered and active trademark of GM for licensing purposes.

General Motors would eliminate an additional 7,000 to 8,000 factory jobs in the United States and shed 2,600 dealers by 2010 under a revised business plan. GM Chief Executive Officer Fritz Henderson said the Pontiac brand would be closed by 2010, calling it an &quot;extremely personal decision&quot;. In addition to speeding up decisions on Saturn, Saab, and Hummer, GM would be left with four brands—Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, and Cadillac.

In early May 2009, Jim Waldron, a Davison, Michigan, Pontiac dealer, announced that he was interested in purchasing the Pontiac brand and logos and had found financing to purchase them and some soon-to-be shuttered GM plants in order to build cars. However, GM had already decided to retire the brand as it has begun to sell off its remaining inventory and said that, unlike Saturn, Hummer, and Saab, Pontiac was not for sale.

The Pontiac brand was pulled after the 2009 model year in Mexico and the brand was renamed Matiz, selling only one vehicle, the Matiz G2 (Matiz&#x27;s logo is similar to Pontiac&#x27;s).

The last Pontiac, a white 2010 model year G6 4-door sedan, was built at the Orion Township Assembly Line in January 2010.

Pontiac was one of three brands General Motors eliminated in 2010; the other two being Hummer and Saturn.

==Style trademarks and logo==
A Native American headdress was used as a logo until 1956. This was updated to the Native American red arrowhead design for 1957 for the remainder of the brand&#x27;s run in all usage except the high-beam indicator lamp, which retained the original logo through 1970. The arrowhead logo is also known as the Dart.

Besides the logo, another identifying feature of Pontiacs was their &quot;Silver Streaks&quot;—one or more narrow strips of stainless steel which extended from the grille down the center of the hood. Eventually, they extended from the rear window to the rear bumper as well, and finally; along the tops of the fins. Although initially a single band, this stylistic trademark doubled to two for 1955 and 1956. The Streaks were discontinued the same year as the Indian Head emblems (1957).
One long-familiar styling element was the split-grille design which was introduced in 1959 to complement the make&#x27;s new &quot;wide track&quot; stance. The 1960 models, however, reverted to the full-width grille styling. The split grille then returned for the 1961 model year and would remain as the marque&#x27;s trademark. Other styling cues were the pointed &quot;arrowhead&quot; nose (in the 1960s and 1970s), and &quot;grilled-over&quot; (in the 1960s), or multiple horizontal-striped taillights. This later feature originated with the 1963 Grand Prix, and although the 1962 Grand Prix also had rear grillework, the taillight lenses were not behind it. Less longstanding but equally memorable is the &quot;cladding&quot; common on the doors and fenders of Pontiacs produced in the 1990s and 2000s. Rather than minimizing the side bumper, Pontiac designers put two troughs going along the length. Bumpers with this appearance were found on nearly all Pontiacs until the arrival of the G6. From 2004 onwards, new Pontiacs had cleaner, more premium styling, but retained the traditional split grille.

===Name controversy===
The name &quot;Pontiac&quot; had come from the Odawa leader who had fought against the British for Fort Detroit in the 18th century. As mentioned above, GM would incorporate Native American imagery into Pontiac and would use Native American names for its cars on the brand. However, there was never controversy during the brand&#x27;s lifespan.

Although GM had already discontinued the Pontiac brand, the fact that GM had used the name gained some controversy in 2021 when the Cherokee Nation asked Jeep to rename its popular Jeep Cherokee and Grand Cherokee vehicles. In its statement, the Cherokee Nation cited GM&#x27;s use of Pontiac as well as the RV manufacturer Winnebago Industries as other examples of Native American names being used on vehicles.

==Canadian/export models==
Pontiacs were built in Canada by Canadians in GM Canada with Canadian raw materials beginning in 1926, with factories in Oshawa, Ontario, and Regina, Saskatchewan. The models they produced were largely the same as their American counterparts. Canadian cars had Canadian oak in the bodies, not peach wood like the U.S. cars. The first significantly different model was the &quot;224&quot;, introduced in 1937 with a Canadian-built version of the then-new Chevrolet straight-six. After 1940 the Pontiac Flathead Six was used, but otherwise, the Canadian Pontiacs shared chassis and body parts with the Chevrolets as a measure to reduce the cost of production for the relatively small Canadian market.

After the Second World War, the Pontiac brand continued to be very popular, and the product line was further harmonized with the Canadian Chevrolet products. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the U.S. market embraced eight-cylinder engines and Pontiacs equipped with the straight-eight engine were popular, but in Canada, the straight-six continued to be the popular offering. Beginning in 1953 the model lineup consisted of the base &quot;Pathfinder&quot;, mid-range &quot;Pathfinder Deluxe&quot;, and top-of-the-line &quot;Laurentian&quot;. The chassis was shared with the Chevrolet, and the interiors were a combination of Chevy and Pontiac parts.

By 1955, the U.S. and Canadian Pontiac lines had diverged almost completely, with the US models positioned as &quot;mid-market&quot; cars available exclusively with the new Pontiac V8, while in Canada the brand was still positioned as an entry-level marque. The Canadian dealership lines were either Chevrolet-Oldsmobile-Cadillac or Pontiac-Buick-GMC; small towns usually had only one or the other, but not both, so it was imperative to keep Pontiac prices competitive with Plymouth and Ford (and Chevrolet). Producing two entirely separate engine series would have increased costs, so the Chevrolet straight-six replaced the Pontiac Flathead Six, and the new Chevrolet V8 replaced the old Pontiac straight-eight.

In 1958, the &quot;Strato-Chief&quot; replaced the &quot;Pathfinder Deluxe&quot;, and in 1959 the line was reorganized with &quot;Laurentian&quot; in mid-range and the new &quot;Parisienne&quot; inserted at the top (similar to the U.S. market Bonneville). Even after the Canadian market was opened by the signing of the 1965 Autopact the Canadian full-sized Pontiac lineup—and the practice of building them on Chevrolet chassis with Chevrolet engines—continued mostly unchanged into the 1980s (although the Strato-Chief was dropped in 1970).

GM Canada also built right-hand drive versions of their Pontiacs for export to Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa as knock-down kits until the late 1960s. The interiors of these cars more closely resembled the equivalent Chevrolets than the Canadian market cars did, as the Chevys had already been designed for right-hand drive.

When the compact Chevrolet Corvair and Pontiac Tempest were introduced in 1960 the Corvair was built in Canada, but the Tempest was not. Importing the Tempest into Canada from the United States was not a viable option as the duties that would have had to have been paid would have substantially increased the price of what was supposed to be the least-expensive Pontiac. Tentative plans to build a Pontiac version of the Corvair were scrapped when the more conventional Chevy II was introduced in late-1961. GM Canada developed a new brand exclusively for the Canadian market for their rebadged Chevy IIs, the Acadian. Acadians were sold alongside the rest of the Pontiac lineup at Pontiac-Buick-GMC dealerships until 1971. When the mid-sized Chevrolet Chevelle was introduced in 1964 it was sold in Canada as the Acadian Beaumont (&#x27;Beaumont&#x27; was formerly the top-level trim of Chevy II-based Acadian), and in 1966 Beaumont became its own marque. The Beaumont-badged Chevelles were in production in Canada until 1969.

Even after the 1965 Autopact (and Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement that replaced it in 1988), the practice of building Pontiac-badged Chevrolets for sale at Canadian dealers continued until the brand was discontinued in 2010. Such cars include the Astre (based on the Vega), the Acadian (based on the Chevette), the Sunburst (based on the Spectrum), the Firefly (based on the Sprint), the Tempest (based on the Corsica), the Sunrunner (based on the Tracker), the Pursuit (based on the Cobalt; later badged as the &quot;G5 Pursuit&quot; and simply &quot;G5&quot;), and the Wave (based on the Aveo; later badged the &quot;G3 Wave&quot; and &quot;G3&quot;).

==Engines==
Pontiac engineer Clayton Leach designed the stamped steel valvetrain rocker arm, a simplified and reliable alternative to a bearing-equipped rocker. This design was subsequently picked up by nearly every OHV engine manufacturer at one point or another.

Pontiac began work on a V8 configuration in 1946. This was initially intended to be an L-head engine, and 8 experimental units were built and extensively tested by the end of the 1940s. But testing comparisons to the OHV Oldsmobile V8 revealed the L-head could not compete performance-wise. So, in addition to building a new Pontiac Engineering building in 1949–1951, the decision to re-direct the V8 to an OHV design delayed its introduction until the 1953 model year, however, the Buick division was introducing its new engine (Nail valve V-8) in 1953 and asked the corporation to hold back or delay Pontiac&#x27;s V8 introduction until the 1955 model year which it did.

In mid-1956, Pontiac introduced a higher-powered version of its V8. Among other things, this version of the engine was equipped with a high-performance racing camshaft and dual 4-barrel carburetors. This was the first in a series of NASCAR-ready pre- Super-Duty V8 engines and introduced the long line of multi-carburetor-equipped engines that saw Pontiac become a major player during the muscle car and pony car era of the 1960s. The enlarged 1956 Pontiac V8 found its way into light-duty GMC pickup trucks.

Pontiac&#x27;s second-generation V8 engines shared numerous similarities, allowing many parts to interchange from its advent in 1959 to its discontinuation in 1979. Displacement ranged from . The similarity of the engines (except for the 301 &amp; 265 versions) makes rebuilding these engines relatively easier. This feature also made it possible for Pontiac to develop the modern muscle car, by the relatively simple process of placing its second largest-displacement engine, the into its mid-size car, the Le Mans, making the Pontiac LeMans GTO.

From their inception in the 1950s until the early 1970s, Pontiac engines were known for their performance. The V8 was the largest and available in most Pontiacs except in the compact-size cars. At the height of the horsepower era, Pontiac engines reached ratings of (SAE gross), though other engines achieved considerably higher outputs. Federal emissions laws eventually brought the horsepower era to a close and resulted in a steady decline for Pontiac&#x27;s engines. One holdout to this industry-wide slide was the Super Duty 455 engine of 1973–1974. Available only in the Firebird Formula and Trans Am models, this was rated at net initially but after having issues passing EPA emissions tests, the camshaft was changed to the old RA III cam, and with the change, came a net rating. The engine was the pinnacle of Pontiac engine development and was a strong performer that included a few race-specific features, such as provisions for dry-sump oiling.

The only non-traditional Pontiac V8 engines were the and the . Produced from 1977 through 1981, these engines had the distinction of being the last V8s produced by Pontiac; GM merged its various brands&#x27; engines into one collectively shared group in 1980, entitled General Motors Powertrain. The 301 had a bore and stroke, identical to the Chevrolet small-block engine and Ford Boss 302 engine.

Pontiac engines were not available in Canada, however, but were replaced with Chevrolet engines of similar size and power, resulting in such models as the Beaumont SD-396 with a Chevrolet big-block V8.

===Carburetors===
Pontiac used Carter 1-barrel carburetors for many years but, by the time of the second generation, the V8 engines had switched mostly to 2-barrel offerings. These also were the basis for the Tri-Power setups on the engines.

The Tri-Power setup included one center carburetor with idle control and two end carburetors that did not contribute until the throttle was opened more than halfway. This was accomplished two ways, mechanically for the manual transmission models, and via a vacuum switch on the automatics. This went through various permutations as it was only a factory-installed option from 1957 through 1966.

Pontiac also had a square-bore 4-barrel at the time, but this was rated at lower horsepower than the Tri-Power. This carburetor was later replaced by the Quadrajet, a spread bore. The term &quot;Spread-bore&quot; signifies the difference in sizes between the primaries and secondaries, using smaller primaries paired with larger secondaries for increased airflow at wider throttle with fuel delivery changes akin to the two-plus-four benefit of Tri-Power but with a single carburetor. The Quadrajet was not the only thing that gave the top GTO 400 engine and the 428 H-O engines the same horsepower as the 389 and 421. The new engine had redesigned cylinder heads with different valve angles and larger ports that allowed for larger diameter intake and exhaust valves.

By the end of the muscle car era, the Quadrajet setup had become common on Pontiac engines. The Quadrajet design continued until 1990 for Oldsmobile V8 applications, with added computer controls to meet emissions and fuel economy standards.

<text>Choi Hong-hi (; 9 November 1918 – 15 June 2002) was a South Korean Army general, and martial artist who was an important figure in the history of the Korean martial art of Taekwondo, albeit controversial due to his introduction of taekwondo to North Korea.

Choi is regarded by many as the &quot;Founder of Taekwon-Do&quot;—most often by organizations belonging to the International Taekwon-Do Federation (ITF), the first international federation for Taekwondo, which he founded. Others, such as World Taekwondo, portray Choi as either an unimportant or a dishonorable figure in taekwondo history because of his defection to North Korea, whether by omitting him from their versions of taekwondo history or through explicit statements, due to the aforementioned controversy.

== Early life ==
Choi was born on 9 November 1918 in Hwadae, Meigawa-gun, Kankyōhoku-dō, Korea, Empire of Japan (now Myongchon County, North Hamgyong Province, North Korea). Choi originally claimed that his father sent him to study calligraphy under Han Il-dong, who was also &quot;a master of taekkyon, the ancient Korean art of foot fighting&quot;. He later recanted this story and said that he never studied taekkyeon and that it had nothing to contribute to taekwondo. Choi travelled to Japan, where he studied English, mathematics, and karate. In Kyoto, he met a fellow Korean with the surname Kim, who was a karate instructor and taught Choi this martial art. Choi also claimed to have learned Shotokan karate under Funakoshi Gichin. Just before he had left Korea, Choi apparently had a disagreement with a wrestler named Hu, and the possibility of a future confrontation inspired him to train; in his own words, &quot;I would imagine that these were the techniques I would use to defend myself against the wrestler, Mr. Hu, if he did attempt to carry out his promise to tear me limb from limb when I eventually returned to Korea&quot;. Choi attained the rank of 1st &quot;dan&quot; in karate in 1939, and then 2nd &quot;dan&quot; soon after.

== Military career ==

Choi was enlisted into the Japanese army during World War II, later stating that he had been forced to serve. He wrote that he was imprisoned for attempting to escape and, in June 1945, was sentenced to seven years for conspiracy by a Japanese Military Court for his involvement in a rebellion. Following the war, in January 1946, Choi was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Korean army. From 1946 to 1951, Choi received promotions to first lieutenant, captain, major, lieutenant colonel, colonel, and then brigadier general. Choi was promoted to major general in 1954.

== Taekwondo ==

Choi combined elements of Oh Do Kwan Karate and Tang Soo Do to develop a style of the martial art known as &quot;Taekwondo&quot;; his organization spelt it Taekwon-Do, (태권도; 跆拳道), which means &quot;foot, fist, art&quot; or &quot;the way of hand and foot&quot; and it was so named on 11 April 1955. Choi co-founded the Oh Do Kwan, and was made an honorary director and given an honorary 5th &quot;dan&quot; ranking in the Chung Do Kwan. Due to accusations of dishonesty, Choi was stripped of his rank and position in the Chung Do Kwan. 

Choi, together with other Korean martial arts instructors, was a major contributor to the global expansion of taekwondo. ITF taekwondo organizations credit Choi with starting the spread of taekwondo internationally by stationing Korean taekwondo instructors around the world, and have consistently claimed that ITF-style taekwondo is the only authentic style of taekwondo, most notably in early sections of its textbooks. He was also the author of the first English taekwondo syllabus book, &quot;Taekwon-Do&quot;, published by Daeha Publication Company in 1965. In 1972, Choi went into exile in Canada after the South Korean government refused to allow his organisation to teach taekwondo in North Korea, and the South Korea government formed the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) in 1973 (renamed to WT in 2018). In 1979 he traveled and defected to North Korea where he was welcomed by the government and supported in his project of spreading Taekwondo to the world.

== Death ==
Choi died of cancer on 15 June 2002 in Pyongyang, North Korea, where he received a state funeral in the Patriotic Martyrs&#x27; Cemetery. On his funeral committee were:
* Choe Thae-bok
* Kim Jung-rin
* Kim Yong-sun
* Kim Yong-dae
* Ryu Mi-yong
* Ryom Sun-gil
* Kim Kyong-ho
* Sung Sang-sop
* Pak Sun-hui
* An Kyong-ho
* Kang Ryon-hak
* Chang Ung
* Hwang Pong-yong
* Kim Yu-ho
Choi is listed in the Taekwondo Hall of Fame with various titles: &quot;Father of Taekwon-Do,&quot; &quot;Founder and First President of the International Taekwon-Do Federation,&quot; and &quot;Founder of Oh Do Kwan.&quot; Choi is survived by his wife, Choi Joon-hee; his son, Choi Jung-hwa; two daughters, Sunny and Meeyun; and several grandchildren.

== Explanatory notes ==

a. The spelling of &quot;taekwondo&quot; varies widely in English usage. The WT and affiliated organizations typically use &quot;taekwondo,&quot; while the ITF and affiliated organizations typically use &quot;taekwon-do&quot; (as Choi used this spelling). In Wikipedia, the default spelling is &quot;taekwondo.&quot; This article follows this standard, but uses &quot;taekwon-do&quot; when referring specifically to the ITF or affiliated organizations&#x27; names.

b. In Park&#x27;s (1993) article, the note on Choi&#x27;s promotion to 2nd &quot;dan&quot; in karate is followed by a note about the outbreak of World War II, which would suggest that Choi&#x27;s 2nd &quot;dan&quot; promotion occurred no later than the early stages of that conflict (&quot;c.&quot; 1939–1940).

<text>In mathematical logic, a universal quantification is a type of quantifier, a logical constant which is interpreted as &quot;given any&quot;, &quot;for all&quot;, &quot;for every&quot;, or &quot;given an [[Arbitrariness#Mathematics|arbitrary]] element&quot;. It expresses that a predicate can be satisfied by every member of a domain of discourse. In other words, it is the predication of a property or relation to every member of the domain. It asserts that a predicate within the scope of a universal quantifier is true of every value of a predicate variable.

It is usually denoted by the turned A (∀) logical operator symbol, which, when used together with a predicate variable, is called a universal quantifier (&quot;, &quot;, or sometimes by &quot;&quot; alone). Universal quantification is distinct from &quot;existential&quot; quantification (&quot;there exists&quot;), which only asserts that the property or relation holds for at least one member of the domain.

Quantification in general is covered in the article on quantification (logic). The universal quantifier is encoded as in Unicode, and as codice_1 in LaTeX and related formula editors.

== Basics ==
Suppose it is given that
2·0 = 0 + 0, and 2·1 = 1 + 1, and , ..., and 2 · 100 = 100 + 100, and ..., etc.
This would seem to be an infinite logical conjunction because of the repeated use of &quot;and&quot;. However, the &quot;etc.&quot; cannot be interpreted as a conjunction in formal logic, Instead, the statement must be rephrased:
For all natural numbers &quot;n&quot;, one has 2·&quot;n&quot; = &quot;n&quot; + &quot;n&quot;.
This is a single statement using universal quantification.

This statement can be said to be more precise than the original one. While the &quot;etc.&quot; informally includes natural numbers, and nothing more, this was not rigorously given. In the universal quantification, on the other hand, the natural numbers are mentioned explicitly.

This particular example is true, because any natural number could be substituted for &quot;n&quot; and the statement &quot;2·&quot;n&quot; = &quot;n&quot; + &quot;n&quot;&quot; would be true. In contrast,
For all natural numbers &quot;n&quot;, one has 2·&quot;n&quot; &gt; 2 + &quot;n&quot;
is false, because if &quot;n&quot; is substituted with, for instance, 1, the statement &quot;2·1 &gt; 2 + 1&quot; is false. It is immaterial that &quot;2·&quot;n&quot; &gt; 2 + &quot;n&quot;&quot; is true for &quot;most&quot; natural numbers &quot;n&quot;: even the existence of a single counterexample is enough to prove the universal quantification false.

On the other hand,
for all composite numbers &quot;n&quot;, one has 2·&quot;n&quot; &gt; 2 + &quot;n&quot;
is true, because none of the counterexamples are composite numbers. This indicates the importance of the &quot;domain of discourse&quot;, which specifies which values &quot;n&quot; can take. In particular, note that if the domain of discourse is restricted to consist only of those objects that satisfy a certain predicate, then for universal quantification this requires a logical conditional. For example,
For all composite numbers &quot;n&quot;, one has 2·&quot;n&quot; &gt; 2 + &quot;n&quot;
is logically equivalent to
For all natural numbers &quot;n&quot;, if &quot;n&quot; is composite, then 2·&quot;n&quot; &gt; 2 + &quot;n&quot;.
Here the &quot;if ... then&quot; construction indicates the logical conditional.

=== Notation ===
In symbolic logic, the universal quantifier symbol formula_1 (a turned &quot;A&quot; in a sans-serif font, Unicode U+2200) is used to indicate universal quantification. It was first used in this way by Gerhard Gentzen in 1935, by analogy with Giuseppe Peano&#x27;s formula_2 (turned E) notation for existential quantification and the later use of Peano&#x27;s notation by Bertrand Russell.

For example, if &quot;P&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is the predicate &quot;2·&quot;n&quot; &gt; 2 + &quot;n&quot;&quot; and N is the set of natural numbers, then
: formula_3
is the (false) statement
:&quot;for all natural numbers &quot;n&quot;, one has 2·&quot;n&quot; &gt; 2 + &quot;n&quot;.

Similarly, if &quot;Q&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is the predicate &quot;n&quot; is composite&quot;, then
: formula_4
is the (true) statement
:&quot;for all natural numbers &quot;n&quot;, if &quot;n&quot; is composite, then &quot;.

Several variations in the notation for quantification (which apply to all forms) can be found in the &quot;Quantifier&quot; article.

== Properties ==

=== Negation ===
The negation of a universally quantified function is obtained by changing the universal quantifier into an existential quantifier and negating the quantified formula. That is, 
:formula_5
where formula_6 denotes negation.

For example, if is the propositional function &quot; is married&quot;, then, for the set of all living human beings, the universal quantification
Given any living person , that person is married
is written
:formula_7

This statement is false. Truthfully, it is stated that
It is not the case that, given any living person , that person is married
or, symbolically:
:formula_8.

If the function is not true for &quot;every&quot; element of , then there must be at least one element for which the statement is false. That is, the negation of formula_7 is logically equivalent to &quot;There exists a living person who is not married&quot;, or:
:formula_10

It is erroneous to confuse &quot;all persons are not married&quot; (i.e. &quot;there exists no person who is married&quot;) with &quot;not all persons are married&quot; (i.e. &quot;there exists a person who is not married&quot;):
:formula_11

=== Other connectives ===
The universal (and existential) quantifier moves unchanged across the logical connectives ∧, ∨, →, and ↚, as long as the other operand is not affected; that is:

:formula_12

Conversely, for the logical connectives ↑, ↓, ↛, and ←, the quantifiers flip:

:formula_13
=== Rules of inference ===

A rule of inference is a rule justifying a logical step from hypothesis to conclusion. There are several rules of inference which utilize the universal quantifier.

&quot;Universal instantiation&quot; concludes that, if the propositional function is known to be universally true, then it must be true for any arbitrary element of the universe of discourse. Symbolically, this is represented as

:formula_14

where &quot;c&quot; is a completely arbitrary element of the universe of discourse.

&quot;Universal generalization&quot; concludes the propositional function must be universally true if it is true for any arbitrary element of the universe of discourse. Symbolically, for an arbitrary &quot;c&quot;,

:formula_15

The element &quot;c&quot; must be completely arbitrary; else, the logic does not follow: if &quot;c&quot; is not arbitrary, and is instead a specific element of the universe of discourse, then P(&quot;c&quot;) only implies an existential quantification of the propositional function.
=== The empty set ===

By convention, the formula formula_16 is always true, regardless of the formula &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;); see vacuous truth.

== Universal closure ==

The universal closure of a formula φ is the formula with no free variables obtained by adding a universal quantifier for every free variable in φ. For example, the universal closure of
:formula_17
is
:formula_18.

== As adjoint ==
In category theory and the theory of elementary topoi, the universal quantifier can be understood as the right adjoint of a functor between power sets, the inverse image functor of a function between sets; likewise, the existential quantifier is the left adjoint.

For a set formula_19, let formula_20 denote its powerset. For any function formula_21 between sets formula_19 and formula_23, there is an inverse image functor formula_24 between powersets, that takes subsets of the codomain of &quot;f&quot; back to subsets of its domain. The left adjoint of this functor is the existential quantifier formula_25 and the right adjoint is the universal quantifier formula_26.

That is, formula_27 is a functor that, for each subset formula_28, gives the subset formula_29 given by
:formula_30
those formula_31 in the image of formula_32 under formula_33. Similarly, the universal quantifier formula_34 is a functor that, for each subset formula_28, gives the subset formula_36 given by
:formula_37
those formula_31 whose preimage under formula_33 is contained in formula_32.

The more familiar form of the quantifiers as used in first-order logic is obtained by taking the function &quot;f&quot; to be the unique function formula_41 so that formula_42 is the two-element set holding the values true and false, a subset &quot;S&quot; is that subset for which the predicate formula_43 holds, and
:formula_44
:formula_45
which is true if formula_32 is not empty, and
:formula_47
which is false if S is not X.

The universal and existential quantifiers given above generalize to the presheaf category.

<doc id="76176" wikidata="Q3071551" url="?curid=76176" title="Pride">
<text>Pride is a human secondary emotion that constitutes a sense of satisfaction with one&#x27;s identity, performance, or accomplishments. It may be considered the opposite of shame or of humility, and, depending on context, may be considered a virtue or vice. &quot;Pride&quot; may refer to a content sense of attachment toward one&#x27;s own or another&#x27;s choices and actions, or one&#x27;s belonging to a group of people. Typically, it is a product of praise, independent self-reflection and a fulfilled feeling of belonging. Other possible objects of pride are one&#x27;s ethnicity and one&#x27;s sexual identity (for example, LGBTQ pride). It may also refer to foolhardiness or a corrupt, irrational sense of one&#x27;s personal value, status, or accomplishments and in this sense can be used synonymously with hubris or vanity.

While some philosophers such as Aristotle (and George Bernard Shaw) consider pride (but not hubris) a profound virtue, some world religions consider pride as a form of sin, as stated in Proverbs of the Hebrew Bible. In Judaism, pride is called the root of all evil. In Catholicism, it is one of the seven deadly sins. When viewed as a virtue, pride in one&#x27;s abilities is known as virtuous pride, greatness of soul, or magnanimity, but when viewed as a vice, it is often known to be self-idolatry, sadistic contempt or vainglory.

==Etymology==
&quot;Proud&quot; comes from late Old English , probably from Old French &quot;brave, valiant&quot; (11th century) (which became in French), from Late Latin term &quot;useful,&quot; which is compared with the Latin &quot;be of use.&quot; The sense of &quot;having a high opinion of oneself,&quot; not in French, may reflect the Anglo-Saxons&#x27; opinion of the Norman knights who called themselves &quot;proud.&quot;

== Ancient Greek philosophy ==
Aristotle identified pride (, variously translated as proper pride, the greatness of soul and magnanimity) as the crown of the virtues, distinguishing it from vanity, temperance and humility, thus:
He then concludes that,
By contrast, Aristotle defined the vice of hubris as follows:
Thus, although pride and hubris are often deemed the same thing, for Aristotle and many philosophers hubris is an entirely different thing from pride.

== Psychology ==
Pride, when classified as an emotion or passion, is both cognitive and evaluative; its object, that it cognizes and evaluates, is the self and its properties, or something the proud individual identifies with. The field of psychology classifies it with guilt and shame as a self-conscious emotion that results from the evaluations of oneself and one&#x27;s behavior according to internal and external standards. Pride results from satisfying or conforming to a standard; guilt or shame from defying it. There is a lack of research that addresses pride, perhaps because it is despised as well as valued in the individualist West, where it is experienced as pleasurable.

=== Emotion ===
In psychological terms, positive pride is &quot;a pleasant, sometimes exhilarating, emotion that results from a positive self-evaluation&quot;. It was added to the University of California, Davis, &quot;Set of Emotion Expressions&quot;, as one of three &quot;self-conscious&quot; emotions known to have recognizable expressions (along with embarrassment and shame).

The term &quot;&quot; was coined by Italian psychologist Isabella Poggi to describe the pride experienced and expressed in the moments following a personal triumph over adversity. Facial expressions and gestures that demonstrate pride can involve a lifting of the chin, smiles, or arms on hips to demonstrate victory. Individuals may implicitly grant status to others based solely on their expressions of pride, even in cases in which they wish to avoid doing so. Indeed, some studies indicate that the nonverbal expression of pride conveys a message that is automatically perceived by others about a person&#x27;s high social status in a group.

Behaviorally, pride can also be expressed by adopting an expanded posture in which the head is tilted back and the arms extended out from the body. This postural display is innate, as it is shown in congenitally blind individuals who have lacked the opportunity to see it in others.

=== Positive outcomes ===
Pride results from self-directed satisfaction with meeting personal goals; for example, positive performance outcomes elicit pride in a person when the event is appraised as having been caused by that person alone. 

Pride as a display of the strong self that promotes feelings of similarity to strong others, as well as differentiation from weak others. Seen in this light, pride can be conceptualized as a hierarchy-enhancing emotion, as its experience and display helps rid negotiations of conflict.

Pride involves exhilarated pleasure and a feeling of accomplishment. It is related to &quot;more positive behaviors and outcomes in the area where the individual is proud&quot;. Pride is associated with positive social behaviors such as helping others and . Along with hope, it is an emotion that facilitates performance attainment, as it can help trigger and sustain focused efforts, helping individuals prepare for upcoming evaluative events. It may also help enhance the quality and flexibility of the effort expended. Pride can enhance creativity, productivity, and altruism. Researchers have found that among African-American youth, pride is associated with a higher GPA in less socioeconomically advantaged neighborhoods, whereas in more advantaged neighborhoods, pride is associated with a lower GPA.

=== Economics ===
In the field of economic psychology, pride is conceptualized on a spectrum ranging from &quot;proper pride&quot;, associated with genuine achievements, and &quot;false pride&quot;, which can be maladaptive or even pathological. Lea &quot;et al.&quot; examined the role of pride in various economic situations and claim that . Understood in this way, pride is an emotional state that works to ensure that people take financial decisions that are in their long-term interests, even when in the short term they would appear irrational.

=== Sin and self-acceptance ===

Inordinate self-esteem is called &quot;pride&quot;. Classical Christian theology views pride as being the result of high self-esteem, and thus high self-esteem was viewed as the primary human problem, but beginning in the 20th century, &quot;humanistic psychology&quot; diagnosed the primary human problem as low self-esteem stemming from a lack of belief in one&#x27;s &quot;true worth&quot;. Carl Rogers observed that most people &quot;regard themselves as worthless and unlovable.&quot; Thus, they lack self-esteem.

In the King James Bible, people exhibiting excess pride are labeled with the term, &quot;Haughty&quot;.

Terry Cooper describes excessive pride (along with low self-esteem) as an important framework in which to describe the human condition. He examines and compares the Augustinian-Niebuhrian conviction that pride is primary, the feminist concept of pride as being absent in the experience of women, the humanistic psychology position that pride does not adequately account for anyone&#x27;s experience, and the humanistic psychology idea that if pride emerges, it is always a false front designed to protect an undervalued self.

He considers that the work of certain Neo-Freudian psychoanalysts, namely Karen Horney, and offers promise in addressing what he describes as a &quot;deadlock between the overvalued and undervalued self&quot;.

Cooper refers to their work in describing the connection between religious and psychological pride as well as sin to describe how a neurotic pride system underlies an appearance of self-contempt and low self-esteem:

The &quot;idealized self,&quot; the &quot;tyranny of the should,&quot; the &quot;pride system&quot;, and the nature of self-hate all point toward the intertwined relationship between neurotic pride and self-contempt. Understanding how a neurotic pride system underlies an appearance of self-contempt and low self-esteem.
Thus, hubris, which is an exaggerated form of self-esteem, is sometimes actually a lie used to cover the lack of self-esteem the hubristic person feels deep down.

=== Hubris and group narcissism ===

Hubris is associated with more intra-individual negative outcomes and expressions of aggression and hostility. Hubris is not necessarily associated with high self-esteem but with highly fluctuating or variable self-esteem. Excessive feelings of hubris tend to create conflict and sometimes to terminate close relationships, which has led it to be understood as one of the few emotions with no clear positive or adaptive functions.

A group that boasts, gloats, or denigrates others tends to become a group with low social status or to be vulnerable to threats from other groups. &quot;[H]ubristic, pompous displays of group pride might be a sign of group insecurity rather than a sign of strength,&quot; while those who express pride by being filled with humility whilst focusing on members&#x27; efforts and hard work tend to achieve high social standing in both the adult public and personal eyes.

Research from the University of Sydney found that hubristic pride correlates with arrogance and self-aggrandizement, and promotes prejudice and discrimination. But authentic pride is associated with self-confidence and accomplishment and promotes more positive attitudes toward outgroups and stigmatized individuals.

== Ethnic ==
=== Across the world===

Pride in ones own ethnicity or ones own culture seems to universally have positive connotations, though like earlier discussions on pride, when pride tips into hubris, people have been known to commit atrocities.

Types of pride across the world seem to have a broad variety. The difference of type may have no greater contrast than that between the U.S. and China. In the U.S., individual pride and seems to be held more often in thought. The people in China seem to hold for the nation as a whole.

The value of pride in the individual or the society as a whole seems to be a running theme and debate among cultures. This debate shadows the discussion on pride so much so that perhaps the discussion on pride should not be about whether pride is necessarily good or bad, but about which form of it is the most useful.

Pride has gained a lot of negative recognition in the western cultures, largely due to its status as one of the Seven Deadly Sins. It was popularized by the Pope Gregory I of the Catholic Church in the late sixth century, but before that it was recognized by a Christian Monk named Evagrius Ponticus in the fourth century as one of the evils human beings should resist.

In Germany, &quot;national pride&quot; (&quot;&quot;) is often associated with Nazism. Strong displays of national pride are therefore considered to be in poor taste by many Germans. There is an ongoing public debate about the issue of German patriotism. The World Cup in 2006, held in Germany, saw a wave of patriotism sweep the country in a manner not seen for many years. Although many were hesitant to show such blatant support as the hanging of the national flag from windows, as the team progressed through the tournament, so too did the level of support across the nation.

=== Asian ===

The term &quot;Asian pride&quot; in modern usage refers mostly to those of East Asian descent, though it can include anyone of Asian descent. Asian pride was originally fragmented, as Asian nations have long had conflicts with each other; examples are the old Japanese and Chinese religious beliefs about their superiority. Asian pride emerged prominently during European colonialism. At one time, Europeans controlled 85% of the world&#x27;s land through colonialism, resulting in anti-Western feelings among Asian nations. Today, some Asians still look upon European involvement in their affairs with suspicion. In contrast, Asian empires are proudly remembered by adherents of Asian Pride.

=== Black ===

&quot;Black pride&quot; is a slogan used primarily in the United States to raise awareness for a black racial identity. The slogan has been used by African Americans of sub-Saharan African origin or ancestry to denote a feeling of self-confidence, self-respect, celebrating one&#x27;s heritage, and being proud of one&#x27;s worth.

=== White ===

White pride is a slogan mainly (but not exclusively) used by white separatist, white nationalist, neo-Nazi, and white supremacist organizations in the United States for a white race identity. White pride also consists of white ethnic/cultural pride.

== Mad ==
Mad pride is a worldwide movement and philosophy that mentally ill people should be proud of their madness. It advocates mutual support and rallies for their rights, and aims to popularize the word &quot;mad&quot; as a self-descriptor.

== LGBT ==
LGBT pride is a worldwide movement and philosophy asserting that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) individuals should be proud of their sexual orientation and gender identity. LGBT pride includes advocacy for equal rights and benefits for LGBT people. The movement has three main premises: that people should be proud of their sexual orientation and gender identity, that sexual diversity is a gift, and that sexual orientation and gender identity are inherent and cannot be intentionally altered.

The word &quot;pride&quot; is used in this case as an antonym for &quot;shame&quot;. It is an affirmation of self and community. The modern gay pride movement began after the Stonewall riots—the nearly week-long uprising between New York City youth and police officers following a raid of Stonewall Inn—of the late 1960s. In June 1970, the first pride parade in the United States commemorated the one-year anniversary of the Stonewall riots.

== Vanity ==
In conventional parlance, vanity is sometimes used in a positive sense to refer to a rational concern for one&#x27;s appearance, attractiveness, and dress, and is thus not the same as pride. It can also refer to an excessive or irrational belief in or concern with one&#x27;s abilities or attractiveness in the eyes of others and may, in that sense, be compared to pride. The term &quot;vanity&quot; originates from the Latin word meaning &quot;emptiness&quot;, &quot;untruthfulness&quot;, &quot;futility&quot;, &quot;foolishness&quot;, and &quot;empty pride&quot;. Here, &quot;empty pride&quot; means a fake pride, in the sense of vainglory, unjustified by one&#x27;s own achievements and actions, but sought by pretense and appeals to superficial characteristics.

In many religions, vanity is considered a form of self-idolatry, in which one rejects God for the sake of one&#x27;s own image, and thereby becomes divorced from the graces of God. The stories of Lucifer and Narcissus (who gave us the term narcissism), and others, attend to a pernicious aspect of vanity.

In Western art, vanity was often symbolized by a peacock, and in Biblical terms, by the Whore of Babylon. During the Renaissance, it was invariably represented as a naked woman, sometimes seated or reclining on a couch. She attends to her hair with a comb and mirror. The mirror is sometimes held by a demon or a putto. Other symbols include jewels, gold coins, a purse, and Death himself.

Often depicted is an inscription on a scroll that reads (&quot;All is Vanity&quot;), a quote from the Latin translation of the Book of Ecclesiastes. Although that phrase—itself depicted in a type of still life called vanitas—originally referred not to an obsession with one&#x27;s appearance, but to the ultimate fruitlessness of man&#x27;s efforts in this world, the phrase summarizes the complete preoccupation of the subject of the picture. &quot;The artist invites us to pay lip-service to condemning her&quot;, writes Edwin Mullins, &quot;while offering us full permission to drool over her. She admires herself in the glass, while we treat the picture that purports to incriminate her as another kind of glass—a window—through which we peer and secretly desire her.&quot; The theme of the recumbent woman often merged artistically with the non-allegorical one of a reclining Venus.

In his table of the seven deadly sins, Hieronymus Bosch depicts a bourgeois woman admiring herself in a mirror held up by a devil. Behind her is an open jewelry box. A painting attributed to Nicolas Tournier, which hangs in the Ashmolean Museum, is &quot;An Allegory of Justice and Vanity&quot;. A young woman holds a balance, symbolizing justice; she does not look at the mirror or the skull on the table before her. Vermeer&#x27;s famous painting &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; is sometimes believed to depict the sin of vanity, as the young girl has adorned herself before a glass without further positive allegorical attributes. &quot;All is Vanity&quot;, by Charles Allan Gilbert (1873–1929), carries on this theme. An optical illusion, the painting depicts what appears to be a large grinning skull. Upon closer examination, it reveals itself to be a young woman gazing at her reflection in the mirror of her vanity table. Such artistic works served to warn viewers of the ephemeral nature of youthful beauty, as well as the brevity of human life and the inevitability of death.

<doc id="76180" wikidata="Q1828268" url="?curid=76180" title="List of Interstate Highways">
<text>There are 71 primary Interstate Highways in the Interstate Highway System, a network of freeways in the United States. These primary highways are assigned one- or two-digit route numbers, whereas their associated auxiliary Interstate Highways receive three-digit route numbers. Typically, even-numbered Interstates run east–west, with lower numbers in the south and higher numbers in the north; odd-numbered Interstates run north–south, with lower numbers in the west and higher numbers in the east. Route numbers divisible by 5 usually represent major coast-to-coast or border-to-border routes (ex. I-10 connects Santa Monica, California to Jacksonville, Florida, extending between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans). Auxiliary highways have an added digit prefixing the number of the parent highway.

Five route numbers are duplicated in the system; the corresponding highways are in different regions, reducing potential confusion. In addition to primary highways in the contiguous United States, there are signed Interstates in Hawaii and unsigned Interstates in Alaska and Puerto Rico.


==Contiguous United States==
There are 71 primary interstate highways in the 48 contiguous United States as well as five former and one future primary interstate highway. This number does not include auxiliary Interstate Highways.


























==Other regions==
In addition to the 48 contiguous states, Interstate Highways are found in Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico. The Federal Highway Administration funds four routes in Alaska and three routes in Puerto Rico under the same program as the rest of the Interstate Highway System. However, these routes are not required to meet the same standards as the mainland routes:

===Hawaii===
The Interstate Highways on the island of Oahu, Hawaii are signed with the standard Interstate Highway shield, with the letter &quot;H-&quot; prefixed before the number. They are fully controlled-access routes built to the same standards as the mainland Interstate Highways.



===Alaska===
Alaska&#x27;s Interstate Highways are unsigned as such, although they all have state highway numbers that do not match the Interstate Highway numbers.



===Puerto Rico===
Puerto Rico signs its Interstate Highways as territorial routes, as the numbers do not match their official Interstate Highway designations. Many of the territory&#x27;s routes are freeway-standard toll roads.

<text>Spyker or Spijker was a Dutch carriage, automobile and aircraft manufacturer, started in 1880 by blacksmiths Jacobus and Hendrik-Jan Spijker. Originally located in Hilversum, the company relocated to Trompenburg, Amsterdam in 1898.

Notable products of Spyker were building the Golden Coach for state ceremonial use for the Dutch royalty in 1898. In 1903, the Spyker 60 HP race-car was the world&#x27;s first F4 layout, four-wheel drive car, featuring the first application of a six-cylinder engine, as well as the first four-wheel braking system. The 1919 C1 “Aerocoque” was one of the world&#x27;s first cars with aerodynamically streamlined bodywork.

==History==
In 1880, Dutch brothers Hendrik Jan and Jacobus Spijker, blacksmiths by profession, start their company for building and maintaining carriages in Hilversum, The Netherlands.

In 1898, Spyker manufactured the &quot;Golden Coach&quot;, still in use as one of the two prime ceremonial state coaches of the Dutch monarchy.

In 1899 they started building automobiles, and in 1900 put their first models on display, two-cylinder 3 hp and 5 hp similar to the Benz.

Four-cylinder models were introduced in 1903, along with the six-cylinder &quot;Spyker 60 HP&quot;, a racer which was the world&#x27;s first ever four-wheel drive car with a single engine and four-wheel brakes. It was the first ever car built with front-engine, four-wheel-drive layout, and its engine with six cylinders was also a world&#x27;s first.

The 1905 cars featured a round radiator grille, which became a feature of many of the pre war cars. In 1907, an 18 hp model competed in the 15,000 km Peking to Paris monster race, finishing second in the most grueling race of its time.

Hendrik-Jan Spijker died in 1907 on his return journey from England when the ferry he was on, the SS Berlin, sank, and this loss led to the bankruptcy of the original company. A group of investors bought the company and restarted production, but Jacobus Spijker was no longer involved.

In 1913, the company was having financial problems again, and in 1915 was taken over by new owners and renamed &quot;Nederlandsche Automobiel en Vliegtuigfabriek Trompenburg&quot; (Dutch Car and Aircraft company). Under the new owners, the previous complex model range was simplified and a new car, the 13/30 C1, introduced; sales were disappointing.

In 1914, Spyker merged with Dutch Aircraft Factory N.V. and the company motto became &quot;Nulla Tenaci invia est via&quot; latin for &quot;For the tenacious no road is impassable&quot;. During World War I, in which the Netherlands were neutral, some 100 Spyker fighter aircraft and 200 aircraft engines were produced.

In 1919, after World War I, a two-seater car, the C1 &quot;Aerocoque&quot;, featuring aerodynamically streamlined bodywork influenced by aircraft design, was shown for the first time. It was intended as a show car, but was also produced on a very limited scale. The car&#x27;s bodywork, featuring swooping fenders and an aircraft-like tail, infused by the company&#x27;s knowledge of aircraft aerodynamics, was mainly designed by Jaap Tjaarda van Sterkenburg, brother of John Tjaarda and uncle of Tom Tjaarda, both also car designers.

On November 27, 1920 the first Spyker 30/40HP C4 was completed, sporting a 6-cylinder Maybach engine of . The car was nicknamed &quot;Tenax&quot; (latin for &quot;tenacious&quot;) and improved the long-distance endurance record, held since 1907 by the Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost by some 6,000 km. The C4 completed 30,360 km in the Dutch winter weather in just over a month.

In 1922, racing driver Selwyn Edge took to Brooklands in a Spyker C4 fitted with streamlined racing bodywork, setting a new &quot;Double 12&quot; average world speed record, covering 1,782 miles (2,868 km) at an average speed of for the 24 hour aggregate of two 12-hour periods.

Also in 1922, the company went bankrupt again and was acquired by Spyker&#x27;s distributor in Britain, who renamed the company &quot;Spyker Automobielfabriek&quot;. Production continued and prices dropped but the company continued to decline. Final production was of the C2 two-ton truck and the C4 car, which lasted until 1926 when funds finally ran out.

It is estimated total Spyker car production was at most 2000 cars.

In 1999, a new company, Spyker Cars, was founded, unrelated to the original company but for the brand name, motto and logo.

==License production and auto rental==
Before Hendrik-Jan Spijker&#x27;s death, he and his brother had developed a special relationship with Dutch electrical pioneer, Rento Hofstede Crull. The Spijker brothers had known Hofstede Crull already when he was a young man racing on the velocipede circuits in the Netherlands and in Germany while he was an engineering student first in Mittweida and later in Hannover at the Technische Hochschule in the 1880s. Hofstede Crull had already owned his first automobile in the 1890s. In the first decade, he had accumulated a collection of automobiles which included a number of the Spijker racing models. He housed the collection in one of the wings of the Heemaf, one of the companies he had founded. Although this was all a hobby for him initially, he began assembling Spijkers at Heemaf with the approval of the Spijker brothers and subsequently with that of those who had taken over Spijker. He provided them with improvements on the automobiles. Heemaf&#x27;s board of directors complained that Hofstede Crull was using a part of the factory as his personal garage and auto park. To circumvent the criticism, he established the &quot;Spijker Automobiel Verhuur Maatschappij&quot; which along with Amsterdam&#x27;s &quot;Trompenburg Bedrijf&quot; became the first auto rental companies in the Netherlands. One of his other companies was the &quot;American Refined Motor Company&quot;, which helped improve mechanical motor parts. This all stemmed from an automobile accident that he, Hofstede Crull, and his chauffeur, a man named Poorthuis, had in 1909 when he subsequently discovered a defect in the Spijker&#x27;s steering mechanism which he improved.

==Car models==



==Aircraft==
*Spijker V.1 - 1917 single seat fighter
*Spijker V.2 - 1917 trainer
*Spijker V.3 - 1919 single seat fighter
*Spijker V.4 - two seat reconnaissance aircraft, construction abandoned before completion.

==Spyker on stamps and in film==
Both Spyker brand automobiles appear on Dutch postage stamps (first day of issue: May 10, 2004).

The car driven by Kenneth More in the 1953 film &quot;Genevieve&quot;, about the London to Brighton Veteran Car Run, is a 1905 Spyker 12/16-HP Double Phaeton. The green-coloured vehicle was repainted yellow twice, first for the movie and again for the 2023 Run to commemorate the 70th anniversary of its cinematic release.

<text>Barnstable County is a county in the U.S. state of Massachusetts. At the 2020 census, the population was 228,996. The county seat is Barnstable. The county consists of Cape Cod and associated islands (some adjacent islands are in Dukes County and Nantucket County). Barnstable County was formed as part of the Plymouth Colony on June 2, 1685, including the towns of Falmouth, Sandwich, and others to the east and north on Cape Cod. Plymouth Colony was merged into the Province of Massachusetts Bay in 1691.

==History==

===Giovanni da Verrazzano===
Cape Cod is described in a letter from the Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano to Francis I of France, relating the details of a voyage to the New World made on behalf of the French crown in the ship Dauphine, the only surviving of a fleet of four. Sailing from Madeira in 1524, the Dauphine made land in North Carolina in March. It sailed north to Newfoundland, mapping the coast and interviewing the natives, whom he found friendly south of the cape, but unfriendly north of it. To the north of an island that reminded Verrazzano of Rhodes, the Dauphine made its way with difficulty over shoals &quot;never less than three feet deep&quot; extending &quot;from the continent fifty leagues out to sea,&quot; which Brevoort, based on their extent, has identified as Nantucket Shoals. Verrazzano called them Armellini. On the other side was a promontory, Pallavisino, which is probably the cape, as they sailed along it for &quot;fifty leagues.&quot; Details of the north end are not given, but subsequently they came to a &quot;high country, full of very dense forests, composed of pines,&quot; which, according to Brevoort and others, resembles the coast of Maine.

===Bartholomew Gosnold===
After Verrazzano, what is now the eastern United States acquired the map label of New France, but France had no way to develop it. Scattered colonies in the wilderness of a few dozen men could not be supported until the foundation of Quebec in 1608. Meanwhile, the paper claim did not deter entrepreneurs. In March 1602, Bartholomew Gosnold set sail from Falmouth, Cornwall, in the ship, Concord, transporting a crew of eight, an exploration party of 12, and 20 colonists, with the intent of establishing a trading post in the New World. Intersecting the coast of Maine, they turned to the south, encountered what appeared to be an island, and dropped anchor in Provincetown Harbor. Gosnold at first called the land Shoal Hope, but after discovering it was a cape, and acquiring a hold full of cod from the abundant schools in Cape Cod Bay, he changed the name to Cape Cod.

Gosnold explored the cape, establishing good relations with the natives there, approximately 1500 members of the Nauset Tribe, closely related in language and custom to the Wampanoag people of the mainland, and under their sovereignty. John Brereton, chaplain of the expedition, reported that they were dark-skinned, customarily nude except for deerskins over the shoulders and sealskins around the waist, and wore their long, black hair up in a knot. They painted their bodies. Some knew a few English words, which is something of a historical problem, as Gosnold and his companions are believed to have been the first English to land in America. Gosnold made a point of describing how healthy the people appeared.

Subsequently, Gosnold sailed around the cape to discover an island, &quot;full of wood, vines, gooseberry bushes, whortleberries, raspberries, eglantines, etc.,&quot; as well as large numbers of shore birds. He named it Martha&#x27;s Vineyard after his daughter. Another island nearby, Cuttyhunk Island, he named Elizabeth Island, in honor of Elizabeth I of England, from which the Elizabeth Islands take their name. He intended to place a trading post there, but when the time came for the return voyage, the colonists decided not to remain. Gosnold ventured a second time to the New World in 1608 as Captain John Smith&#x27;s second in command of the Jamestown expedition. After three months there, he died of malaria.

===Martin Pring===
In 1603, another mercantile expedition set sail from Bristol, England, in two ships, the &quot;Speedwell&quot; and the &quot;Discoverer&quot;, commanded by a 23-year-old captain, Martin Pring. Elizabeth I had died two weeks earlier, but Pring had secured permission from Sir Walter Raleigh, who held from the queen exploration rights to all of North America.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (70%) is water. It is the second largest county in Massachusetts by total area. It has about of shoreline.

Barnstable County is not co-extensive with Cape Cod. The latter is a geophysical place defined by its insular or peninsular landmass. According to Freeman, it is a &quot;long, irregular peninsula&quot; between , measured along the north or the south shores respectively, and between wide. Originally, only the tip was considered the cape, but as it was settled the name extended from its tip to the shortest line across the isthmus. Barnstable County, on the other hand, is a geopolitical and legal entity. It is the area contained within the borders of all cities and towns defined to be in the county by the Massachusetts General Court. These borders were decided in episodes of disputed legislation during the centuries since the founding of Plymouth Colony.

The main difference between Cape Cod and Barnstable County is the band of water up to several miles wide extending from the shoreline to the outermost county border. The offshore area contains significant maritime life, is a recreational and transport medium, and contains historical material lost in shipwrecks.

The highest elevation in the county is , at the summit of Pine Hill, on Joint Base Cape Cod, in Bourne. The lowest point is sea level.

===Adjacent counties===

==Politics==


















|}
Until the 1990s, Barnstable County was a stronghold of the Republican Party. The county voted for Republican presidential candidates in every election from 1876 to 1992, with the exception of 1912 (when the Progressive candidate won the county) and 1964. It has since come to favor the Democratic Party, supporting Democratic candidates in all presidential elections since 1992.
===Voter registration===
==Government==

Barnstable County is one of the last functioning counties in Massachusetts. County government consists of a legislative branch (Barnstable County Assembly of Delegates) and an executive branch (Barnstable County Commissioners).

===Barnstable County Assembly of Delegates===
The Assembly of Delegates is the legislative branch of Barnstable County. There are 15 towns in Barnstable County, each town represented on the Assembly. In 1989, by an Act of the Massachusetts General Court and confirmed by most Barnstable County voters, the Barnstable County Home Rule Charter went into effect and the first session of the Assembly of Delegates convened. All legislative powers of the county are vested in the Assembly, which acts by ordinance and adopts resolutions.

The Assembly of Delegates consists of 15 delegates, one representing each of the towns in Barnstable County. A delegate&#x27;s vote is weighted on the basis of the population of his or her town. The town of Barnstable, for example, has the largest share of the vote, at 20.92%, and Truro has the smallest, at 0.93%.

===Barnstable County Commissioners===
There are three Barnstable County Commissioners, who together act as the Executive Branch of county government. Each commissioner is elected at large and serves a four-year staggered term. The commissioners direct county agencies, prepare budgets to submit to the Assembly, oversee the care of county property and finances, propose ordinances to the Assembly, and appoint the County Administrator.

Ronald Bergstrom (D-Chatham), Chair
*Term: 2023–2027

Sheila Lyons (D-Wellfleet), Vice-chair
*Term: 2021–2025

Mark Forest (D-Yarmouth), Commissioner
*Term: 2021–2025

===Cape Cod Commission===
The planning agency of Barnstable County is the Cape Cod Commission.

==Communities==
Cities and towns have been legally incorporated as such under the laws of the State of Massachusetts. They include the entire territory of the state. A city may continue to name itself a town even though legally a city. Villages are subordinate to cities or towns. In addition to and not necessarily based on these legal municipalities are the arbitrary divisions of the United States Census Bureau. Villages are census divisions which may be used as special purpose municipalities or may have a greater sense of civic identity than their constituent town(s), but are not fully functioning municipal corporations. For example, the City of Barnstable has five fire districts that cover the seven villages - each village has its own fire department except that Centerville, Osterville and Marstons Mills have combined their efforts into the COMM Fire Department.

<text>Berkshire County (pronounced ) is the westernmost county in the U.S. state of Massachusetts. As of the 2020 census, the population was 129,026. Its largest city and traditional county seat is Pittsfield. The county was founded in 1761. The Berkshire Hills are centered on Berkshire County. Residents are known as Berkshirites. It exists today only as a historical geographic region, and has no county government, with the exception of the retirement board for former county workers, and the offices of the sheriff and the registrar of deeds.

==Law and government==
Of the fourteen Massachusetts counties, Berkshire County is one of eight that exists today only as a historical geographic region; it has limited county government. Berkshire County government was abolished effective July 1, 2000. Most former county functions were assumed by state agencies, and there is no county council or commission. The sheriff became a Commonwealth employee, but remains locally elected to perform duties within the county region and retains administrative and operational control over the Berkshire Sheriff&#x27;s Office, an independent state agency created after the county government was abolished. The Berkshire Sheriff&#x27;s Office runs the county jail and house of correction.

Local communities were granted the right to form their own regional compacts for sharing services, and the towns of Berkshire County have formed such a regional compact known as the Berkshire Regional Planning Commission.

Berkshire County has three Registry of Deeds Districts, one for each district.

* Berkshire Northern District in Adams contains records for the city of North Adams and the towns of Adams, Cheshire, Clarksburg, Florida, Hancock, Lanesborough, New Ashford, Savoy, Williamstown, and Windsor.
* Berkshire Middle District in Pittsfield contains records for the city of Pittsfield and the towns of Becket, Dalton, Hinsdale, Lee, Lenox, Otis, Peru, Richmond, Stockbridge, Tyringham and Washington.
* Berkshire Southern District in Great Barrington contains records for the towns of Alford, Egremont, Great Barrington, Monterey, Mount Washington, New Marlborough, Sandisfield, Sheffield and West Stockbridge.

Berkshire County is in the , a primarily rural district that makes up most of Western Massachusetts.

Berkshire County has three districts and elected Representatives in the Massachusetts House of Representatives.

* First Berkshire. – Consisting of the towns of Adams, Cheshire, Clarksburg, Florida, Hancock, Hinsdale, Lanesborough, New Ashford, North Adams, Peru, Savoy, Williamstown, and Windsor, all in the county of Berkshire. John Barrett III(D) is the current Representative.

William Smitty Pignatelli (D) is the current Representative.

Berkshire County comprises only part of one district for the Massachusetts Senate due to its low population. The district consists of all 32 cities and towns in Berkshire County as well as the following 25 communities: Ashfield, Buckland, Charlemont, Colrain, Conway, Hawley, Heath, Monroe, Shelburne, Rowe and Whately, in the county of Franklin; Blandford, Chester, Granville, Southwick, and Tolland in the county of Hampden; Chesterfield, Cummington, Goshen, Huntington, Middlefield, Plainfield, Westhampton, Williamsburg and Worthington, in the county of Hampshire. Paul Mark (D) is the current Senator.

The Massachusetts Governor&#x27;s Council, also known as the Executive Council, is composed of eight individuals elected from districts, and the Lt. Governor who serves ex officio. The eight councillors are elected from their respective districts every two years. Berkshire County is part of the 8th District.

The Council generally meets at noon on Wednesdays in its State House Chamber, next to the Governor&#x27;s Office, to act on issues such as payments from the state treasury, criminal pardons and commutations, and approval of gubernatorial appointments such as judges, notaries and justices of the peace.

== History ==
The Mahican (Muh-he-ka-neew) Native American tribe lived in the area that now makes up Berkshire County until the early 18th century, when the first English settlers and frontiersmen appeared and began setting up farms and homesteads. On April 25, 1724, &quot;The English finally paid the Indians 460 pounds, 3 barrels of cider, and 30 quarts of rum&quot; for what is today southern Berkshire County. This deal did not include modern Stockbridge, Richmond, and Lenox, or any northern towns. Berkshire County was the western part of Hampshire County until separated in 1761.

In the 19th century, Berkshire County became popular with the American elite, which built what they called &quot;cottages&quot; throughout the countryside. The Gilded Age ended in the early 20th century with the income tax, World War I, and the Great Depression. In the 20th century, some of these cottages were torn or burned down, while others became prep schools, historic sites, or bed-and-breakfast inns.

Today Berkshire is known throughout the East Coast and the country as the summer home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra at Tanglewood. It includes attractions such as the Clark Art Institute, Norman Rockwell Museum, Naumkeag, Mass MOCA, and Hancock Shaker Village.

<text>Bristol County is a county in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 579,200. The shire town is Taunton. Some governmental functions are performed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, others by the county, and others by local towns and cities. The county is the sixth most populous county in Massachusetts. Bristol County is part of the Providence metropolitan area, which is also included in Greater Boston. The county is adjacent to the state of Rhode Island. It is geographically adjacent to the Massachusetts counties of Plymouth, Norfolk, and Dukes (via water), and the Rhode Island counties of Bristol, Newport, and Providence.

==History==
Bristol County was created by the Plymouth Colony on June 2, 1685, and named after its &quot;shire town&quot; (county seat), Bristol. The Plymouth Colony, along with the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the Maine Colony and several other small settlements were rechartered in 1691, by King William III, to become The Province of Massachusetts Bay.

The towns of Bristol, Barrington, and Warren were awarded to Rhode Island in 1746 as part of the settlement of a long-running boundary dispute (see History of Massachusetts), forming Bristol County, Rhode Island. At the same time, Cumberland, Rhode Island was carved out of Attleborough, Massachusetts and annexed to Providence County, Rhode Island; Tiverton and Little Compton were transferred to Newport County, Rhode Island. East Freetown was officially purchased by Freetown, Massachusetts, from Tiverton in 1747, and so remained on the Massachusetts side.

After the departure of Bristol, Taunton was made the shire town of the county. A second county courthouse was constructed in 1828 in the growing town of New Bedford (designed a &quot;half-shire town&quot;). In 1862, a part of Seekonk (that portion of which is now East Providence, Rhode Island) and the entirety of East Pawtucket were transferred to Providence County, Rhode Island. At the same time, land ceded from Rhode Island was added to Fall River and Westport. The growing Fall River became the site of the third county courthouse in 1877.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (20%) is water. The highest point in Bristol County is Sunrise Hill (Watery Hill) at above sea level located in World War I Memorial Park in North Attleborough. It is also to note that Bristol, Plymouth and Taunton are all places in South West England. Their Massachusetts cousins were named after the originals as South West England was the focal point for sailing and discovery at the time of America&#x27;s discovery. John Cabot set sail from Bristol and sailed down the Severn on which lies Newport in Wales.

==Politics and government==
Bristol County has voted for the presidential nominee of the Democratic Party in every election since 1960 and, with the exception of Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s victorious campaigns of 1952 and 1956, for the Democratic nominee since 1928, before which it was a Republican stronghold. However, in 2024, Republican Donald Trump came the closest to winning the county since 1984 (when Ronald Reagan came within less than 800 votes of winning), with Democrat Kamala Harris winning only 49.6% of the vote. It was also the closest any Massachusetts county came to flipping Republican since 1988, as all counties have been won by the Democratic candidate since 1992.

The Bristol County Sheriff&#x27;s Office maintains its administrative headquarters and operates several jail facilities in the Dartmouth Complex in North Dartmouth in Dartmouth. Jail facilities in the Dartmouth Complex include the Bristol County House Of Correction and Jail, the Bristol County Sheriff&#x27;s Office Women&#x27;s Center, and the C. Carlos Carreiro Immigration Detention Center. The office also operates the Ash Street Jail and Regional Lock-Up and the Juvenile Secure Alternative Lock Up Program (JALP) in New Bedford.

The Bristol County House Of Correction and Jail has room for 1,100 prisoners. It houses men convicted of crimes who have been sentenced to years or less. It also houses high-security male pre-trial prisoners, high-security female prisoners, and pre-trial female prisoners.

The women&#x27;s center, a medium security jail, can house up to 106 women. The self-contained women&#x27;s center had opened as a minimum security pre-release center for male prisoners in 1990 which could house up to 106 prisoners. When it was a pre-release facility it only housed an average of 60 prisoners because the county sheriff imposed strict conditions upon the pre-release program. In 1999 the sheriff received a federal grant to convert the pre-release center into a women&#x27;s center, and he moved the pre-release program to modular units at the main jail.

The Carreiro jail houses detained individuals who are scheduled for deportation and individuals who are engaging in proceedings with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The Ash Street jail houses over 200 pre-trial prisoners and a few sentenced inmate workers for the system. JALP houses up to 12 pre-arraingment juvenile prisoners.

<doc id="76189" wikidata="Q54091" url="?curid=76189" title="Dukes County, Massachusetts">
<text>Dukes County is a county in the U.S. state of Massachusetts. At the 2020 census, the population was 20,600, making it the second-least populous county in Massachusetts. Its county seat is Edgartown.

Dukes County comprises the [[Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts|Vineyard Haven]], MA [[Micropolitan Statistical Area]]. The county consists of 32 named islands, the largest of which is Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. It also includes Chappaquiddick Island (sometimes peninsula of the Vineyard), the Elizabeth Islands, including Cuttyhunk, and Nomans Land.

==History==

The original inhabitants of the islands were Wampanoag, who had several villages. Political jurisdiction over the lands were granted by the English monarchy in overlapping claims to two different British nobles, from which Massachusetts Bay Company settler Thomas Mayhew purchased them in 1641. Mayhew established a colony in his new domain, carefully purchasing land ownership rights from the native inhabitants, and maintaining native governments to continue unimpeded. In 1665, Mayhew&#x27;s lands were included in a grant to James, Duke of York (later King James II). In 1671, a settlement was arranged, allowing Mayhew to continue to rule while placing his territory under the jurisdiction of the Province of New York.

Dukes County was thus established as Dukes County, New York, on November 1, 1683, and included all of Mayhew&#x27;s lands – Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, Nantucket, and the Elizabeth Islands. The county was transferred to Massachusetts on October 7, 1691, and at the same time Nantucket Island was split into the separate Nantucket County, Massachusetts. The 1695 incorporation statute created a county &quot;by the name of Dukes County,&quot; as opposed to the standard form &quot;the county of Dukes&quot; which is the reason for the redundancy in the formal name, &quot;County of Dukes County&quot;.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (79%) is water. It is the third-smallest county by land area in Massachusetts.

<doc id="76190" wikidata="Q54076" url="?curid=76190" title="Essex County, Massachusetts">
<text>Essex County is a county in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of Massachusetts. At the 2020 census, the total population was 809,829, making it the third-most populous county in the state, and the seventy-eighth-most populous in the country. It is part of the Greater Boston area (the Boston–Cambridge–Newton, MA–NH Metropolitan Statistical Area). The largest city in Essex County is Lynn. The county was named after the English county of Essex. It has two traditional county seats: Salem and Lawrence. Prior to the dissolution of the county government in 1999, Salem had jurisdiction over the Southern Essex District, and Lawrence had jurisdiction over the Northern Essex District, but currently these cities do not function as seats of government. However, the county and the districts remain as administrative regions recognized by various governmental agencies, which gathered vital statistics or disposed of judicial case loads under these geographic subdivisions, and are required to keep the records based on them. The county has been designated the Essex National Heritage Area by the National Park Service.

==History==
The county was created by the General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony on May 10, 1643, when it was ordered &quot;that the whole plantation within this jurisdiction be divided into four sheires&quot;. Named after the county in England, Essex then comprised the towns of Salem, Lynn, Wenham, Ipswich, Rowley, Newbury, Gloucester and Andover. In 1680, Haverhill, Amesbury and Salisbury, located north of the Merrimack River, were annexed to Essex County. These communities had been part of Massachusetts&#x27; colonial-era Norfolk County (1643–1680). The remaining four towns within &quot;Old&quot; Norfolk County, which included Exeter and what is now Portsmouth, were transferred to the Province of New Hampshire. The Massachusetts-based settlements were then subdivided over the centuries to produce Essex County&#x27;s modern composition of cities and towns.

Essex County is where Elbridge Gerry (who was born and raised in Marblehead) created a legislative district in 1812 that gave rise to the word &quot;gerrymandering&quot;.

Due to a confluence of floods, hurricanes, and severe winter storms, Essex County has had more disaster declarations than most other U.S. counties, from 1964 to 2016.

==Law and government==
From the founding of the Republican Party until the New Deal, Essex County was a Republican stronghold in presidential elections. Since 1936, it has trended Democratic, with Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956 and Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984 being the only Republicans to carry the county since.

Like several other Massachusetts counties, Essex County exists today only as a historical geographic region, and has no county government. All former county functions were assumed by state agencies in 1999. The sheriff (currently Kevin Coppinger), district attorney (currently Paul Tucker), and some other regional officials with specific duties are still elected locally to perform duties within the county region, but there is no county council, commissioner, or county employees. Communities are now granted the right to form their own regional compacts for sharing services.

==Geography==
Essex County is roughly diamond-shaped and occupies the northeastern corner of the state of Massachusetts.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (41%) is water. Essex County is adjacent to Rockingham County, New Hampshire to the north, the Atlantic Ocean (specifically the Gulf of Maine and Massachusetts Bay) to the east, Suffolk County to the south, Middlesex County to the west and a very small portion of Hillsborough County, New Hampshire to the far north west in Methuen. All county land is incorporated into towns or cities.

Essex County includes the North Shore, Cape Ann, and the lower portions of the Merrimack Valley.

The area includes 34 cities and towns; two National Historic Sites (Salem Maritime National Historic Site and Saugus Iron Works National Historic Site); and thousands of historic sites and districts that illuminate colonial settlement, the development of the shoe and textile industries, and the growth and decline of the maritime industries, including fishing, privateering, and the China trade.

<text>Franklin County is a nongovernmental county in the northwestern part of the U.S. state of Massachusetts. At the 2020 census, the population was 71,029, which made it the least populous county on the Massachusetts mainland, and the third least populous county in the state. Its traditional county seat and most populous city is Greenfield. Its largest town by area is New Salem. Franklin County comprises the Greenfield Town, MA Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is included in the Springfield-Greenfield Town, MA Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
Franklin County was created on June 24, 1811, from the northern third of Hampshire County. It was named for Benjamin Franklin. Franklin County&#x27;s government was abolished by the state government in 1997, at the county&#x27;s request.

==Law and government==
Like several other Massachusetts counties, Franklin County exists today only as a geographic region and has no county government. The Franklin County Commission voted itself out of existence, and all former state-mandated county functions were assumed by state agencies in 1997. The sheriff and some other regional officials with specific duties are still elected locally to perform duties within the county region. Counties in Massachusetts and New England generally are historically weak governmental structures.
The primary subdivision of the Commonwealth is the municipal town. Communities are permitted to form regional compacts for sharing services. The municipalities of Franklin County have formed the Franklin Regional Council of Governments. The regional council provides various services on a regional basis, and a majority of the county&#x27;s towns are members of the Franklin County Solid Waste Management District, which provides municipal waste disposal and recycling services to its members. Public transportation throughout the county and in the North Quabbin area of northwestern Worcester County is provided by the Franklin Regional Transit Authority.

<text>Hampden County is a non-governmental county located in the Pioneer Valley of the U.S. state of Massachusetts, in the United States. As of the 2020 census, Hampden County&#x27;s population was 465,825. Its traditional county seat is Springfield, the Connecticut River Valley&#x27;s largest city, and economic and cultural capital; with an estimated population of 154,758, approximately one-third of Hampden County residents live in Springfield.

==History==
Springfield had been Hampshire County&#x27;s traditional shire town since its founding in 1636, then in 1794 Northampton was made Hampshire County&#x27;s shire town. Springfield grew at a pace far quicker than Northampton, so was granted shire town-status over its own southerly jurisdiction. The southern division of Hampshire County was separated as Hampden County on August 1, 1812, by a prior act of the Massachusetts General Court on February 25, 1812, with Springfield named as the shire town. The agreement of settlement (regarding assets, liabilities, income and expenses) made between Hampden and Hampshire counties in November 1812 can be found in the Court of Sessions Record Book 1, pages 5–6 of the Hampden County Commissioners&#x27; Archives, housed in the Registry of Deeds. Hampden County was named for parliamentarian John Hampden, and is the youngest county by establishment date in the state.

To the north of Hampden County is modern-day Hampshire County; to the west is Berkshire County; to the east is Worcester County; to the south are Litchfield County, Hartford County, and Tolland County in Connecticut. Hampden County is part of the Springfield Metropolitan Statistical Area. It is the most urban county in Western Massachusetts. The Knowledge Corridor surrounding Springfield-Hartford is New England&#x27;s second most populous urban area (after Greater Boston) with 1.9 million people.

==Law and government==
As with most Massachusetts counties, Hampden County exists today only as a historical geographic region, and has no county government. All former county functions were assumed by state agencies in 1998. The sheriff and some other regional officials with specific duties are still elected locally to perform duties within the county borders, but there is no county council, county commission or other county governing body. Communities are now granted the right to form their own regional compacts for sharing services. Hampden County and Hampshire County together are part of the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission.

<text>Hampshire County is a historical and judicial county located in the U.S. state of Massachusetts. As of the 2020 census, the population was 162,308. Its most populous municipality is Amherst (due to seasonal student population; the largest year-round is Northampton), its largest town in terms of landmass is Belchertown, and its traditional county seat is Northampton. The county is named after the county Hampshire, in England. Hampshire County is part of the Springfield, MA Metropolitan Statistical Area. Together with Hampden County, Hampshire County municipalities belong to the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission.

==History==

Hampshire County was constituted in 1662 from previously unorganized territory comprising the entire western part of Massachusetts Bay Colony. It included the original towns of Springfield, Northampton, and Hadley. The original Hampshire County also included territory that is now in modern-day Hampden County, Franklin County, and Berkshire County, as well as small parts of modern-day Worcester County. By 1683, three new towns (Westfield (now Southwick), Suffield, and Enfield) had been incorporated south of Springfield. These towns were partly or wholly in the modern state of Connecticut at the time of their incorporation. They resulted in a border dispute between the Connecticut Colony and Massachusetts Bay Colony.

In 1731, Worcester County was created, which included the original town of Brookfield (incorporated in 1718 as part of Hampshire County). More territory was lost to Worcester County in 1742 when the town of Western (now Warren) was created and added to Worcester County. Further territorial losses occurred in 1749 when the towns of Enfield, Somers (split off from Enfield in 1734), and Suffield unilaterally joined Connecticut Colony. In 1761, Berkshire County was partitioned from Hampshire County. In 1811, Franklin County was split off from the northern part of Hampshire, and in the following year, Hampden County was split off from its southern part.

Following the dissolution of the county government in 1999, county affairs were managed by the Hampshire Council of Governments. The council itself ceased operations in 2019, due to what an appraisal of the council termed a &quot;fundamentally flawed, unsustainable operational model&quot;; it had no inherent source of income and lacked a regional planning function.

<doc id="76195" wikidata="Q54073" url="?curid=76195" title="Middlesex County, Massachusetts">
<text>Middlesex County is a county located in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 1,632,002, making it the most populous county in both Massachusetts and New England and the 22nd most populous county in the United States. This makes the county the most populous county on the East Coast outside of New York or Florida. Middlesex County is one of two U.S. counties (along with Santa Clara County, California) to be amongst the top 25 counties with the highest household income and the 25 most populated counties. It is included in the Census Bureau&#x27;s Boston–Cambridge–Newton, MA–NH Metropolitan Statistical Area. As part of the 2020 United States census, the Commonwealth&#x27;s mean center of population for that year was geo-centered in Middlesex County, in the town of Natick (this is not to be confused with the geographic center of Massachusetts, which is in Rutland, Worcester County).

On July 11, 1997, Massachusetts abolished the executive government of Middlesex County primarily due to the county&#x27;s insolvency. Middlesex County continues to exist as a geographic boundary and is used primarily as district jurisdictions within the court system and for other administrative purposes; for example, as an election district. The National Weather Service weather alerts (such as severe thunderstorm warning) continue to localize based on Massachusetts&#x27;s counties.

==History==
The county was created by the Massachusetts General Court on May 10, 1643, when it was ordered that &quot;the whole plantation within this jurisdiction be divided into four shires.&quot; Middlesex initially contained Charlestown, Cambridge, Watertown, Sudbury, Concord, Woburn, Medford, and Reading. In 1649 the first Middlesex County Registry of Deeds was created in Cambridge.

On April 19, 1775, Middlesex was the site of the first armed conflict of the American Revolutionary War.

In 1855, the Massachusetts State Legislature created a minor Registry of Deeds for the Northern District of Middlesex County in Lowell.

In the late 19th century and early 20th century, Boston annexed several of its adjacent cities and towns including Charlestown and Brighton from Middlesex County, resulting in an enlargement and accretion toward Suffolk County.

Beginning prior to the dissolution of the executive county government, the county comprised two regions with separate county seats for administrative purposes:
*The Middlesex-North District (smaller) with its county seat in Lowell under the Registry of Deeds consisted of the city of Lowell, and its adjacent towns of Billerica, Carlisle, Chelmsford, Dracut, Dunstable, Tewksbury, Tyngsborough, Westford and Wilmington.
*The Middlesex-South District (larger) with the county seat in Cambridge consisted of the remaining 44 cities and towns of Middlesex County.

Since the start of the 21st century, much of the current and former county offices have physically decentralized from the Cambridge seat, with the sole exceptions being the Registry of Deeds and the Middlesex Probate and Family Court, which both retain locations in Cambridge and Lowell. Since the first quarter of 2008, the Superior Courthouse has been seated in the city of Woburn; the Sheriff&#x27;s Office is now administratively seated in the city of Medford and the Cambridge-based County Jail has since been amalgamated with another county jail facility in Billerica. The Cambridge District Court (which has jurisdiction for Arlington, Belmont and Cambridge); along with the Middlesex County District Attorney&#x27;s Office, although not a part of the Middlesex County government, was also relatedly forced to relocate to Medford at the time of the closure of the Superior Courthouse building in Cambridge.

===Law and government===
Of the fourteen counties of Massachusetts, Middlesex is one of eight which have had no county government or county commissioners since July 1, 1998, when county functions were assumed by state agencies at local option following a change in state law. Immediately prior to its dissolution, the executive branch consisted of three County Commissioners elected at-large to staggered four-year terms. There was a County Treasurer elected to a six-year term. The county derived its revenue primarily from document filing fees at the Registries of Deeds and from a Deeds Excise Tax; also a transfer tax was assessed on the sale price of real estate and collected by the Registries of Deeds.

Budgets as proposed by the County Commissioners were approved by a County Advisory Board that consisted of a single representative of each of the 54 cities and towns in Middlesex County. The votes of the individual members of the advisory board were weighted based on the overall valuation of property in their respective communities.

The County Sheriff and two Registers of Deeds (one for the Northern District at Lowell and another for the Southern District at Cambridge) are each elected to serve six-year terms. Besides the employees of the Sheriff&#x27;s Office and the two Registries of Deeds, the county had a Maintenance Department, a Security Department, some administrative staff in the Treasurer&#x27;s and Commissioners&#x27; Offices, and the employees of the hospital.

The county government also owned and operated the Superior Courthouse, one of which was formerly in Cambridge (since 2008 relocated to Woburn.) and one in Lowell; and the defunct Middlesex County Hospital in the city of Waltham.

The legislation abolishing the Middlesex County executive retained the Sheriff and Registers of Deeds as independently elected officials, and transferred the Sheriff&#x27;s Office under the state Department of Public Safety and the two Registry of Deeds offices to the Massachusetts Secretary of State&#x27;s Office. Additionally, all county maintenance and security employees were absorbed into the corresponding staffs of the Massachusetts Trial Court. The legislation also transferred ownership of the two Superior Courthouses to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The hospital was closed. Finally, the office of County Commissioner was immediately abolished and the office of County Treasurer was abolished as of December 31, 2002. Any county roads transferred to the Commonwealth as part of the dissolution. The other administrative duties (such as Sheriff, Department of Deeds and court system, etc.) and all supporting staff were transferred under the Commonwealth as well.

===Administrative structure today===
Records of land ownership in Middlesex County continue to be maintained at the two Registries of Deeds. Besides the Sheriff and the two Registers of Deeds, the Middlesex District Attorney, the Middlesex Register of Probate and the Middlesex Clerk of Courts (which were already part of state government before the abolition of Middlesex County government) are all elected countywide to six-year terms.

In Middlesex County (as in the entirety of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts), the governmental functions such as property tax assessment and collection, public education, road repair and maintenance, and elections were all conducted at the municipal city and town level and not by the county government.

In 2012 the 22-story Superior Court Building in Cambridge which was transferred from the abolished Executive County government was sold by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Due to its transfer from state control, many local residents had tried to force the private developers to reduce the overall height of the structure.

Even following the abolition of the executive branch for county government in Middlesex, communities are still granted a right by the Massachusetts state legislature to form their own regional compacts for sharing of services and costs thereof.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (3.5%) is water. It is the third-largest county in Massachusetts by land area.

It is bounded southeast by the Charles River and drained by the Merrimack, Nashua, and Concord rivers, and other streams.

The MetroWest region comprises much of the southern portion of the county.

It formerly ran the Middlesex Jail in Cambridge, which closed on June 28, 2014. In addition, the Sheriff&#x27;s Office operates the Office of Civil Process and, the Lowell Community Counseling Centers, and crime prevention and community service programs.

Prior to 1960, Middlesex County was a Republican Party stronghold, backing only two Democratic Party presidential candidates from 1876 to 1956. The 1960 election started a reverse trend, with the county becoming a Democratic stronghold. This has been even more apparent in recent years, with George H. W. Bush in 1988 being the last Republican presidential candidate to manage forty percent of the county&#x27;s votes and Mitt Romney in 2012 being the last Republican presidential candidate to manage even thirty percent of the vote. In 2020, Joe Biden won 71% of the vote, the highest percent for any presidential candidate since 1964.

<text>Norfolk County ( ) is located in the U.S. state of Massachusetts. At the 2020 census, the population was 725,981. Its county seat is Dedham. The county was named after the English county of the same name. Two towns, Cohasset and Brookline, are exclaves. Norfolk County is included in the Boston-Cambridge-Newton, MA-NH Metropolitan Statistical Area. Norfolk County is the 24th highest-income county in the United States with a median household income of $107,361. It is the wealthiest county in Massachusetts.

==History==
One of the original counties of the Massachusetts Bay Colony created on May 10, 1643, was called Norfolk, and is unrelated to the current Norfolk County. It covered territory in what is now New Hampshire, and was abolished on September 18, 1679, when King Charles II separated the Colony of New Hampshire from Massachusetts.

Shortly after the Constitution of Massachusetts was adopted on October 25, 1780, a number of towns in Suffolk County, of which Dedham was then a part, elected delegates to a convention to decide upon some policy relative to the division of the county. The convention met at Gay&#x27;s Tavern in Dedham on December 12, 1780, and adopted a resolution to the effect that the towns of Bellingham, Dedham, Foxborough, Franklin, Medfield, Medway, Needham, Stoughton, Stoughtonham, Walpole, and Wrentham, along with the Middlesex County towns of Holliston, Hopkinton, Natick, and Sherborn ought to be formed into a new county with Medfield as the shiretown. The Great and General Court did not look favorably upon the resolution, however, and no new county was then created.

Norfolk County, Massachusetts was created on June 20, 1793. Legislation passed in March which separated off all the towns in Suffolk County except Boston and Chelsea (which at the time included what are now Revere and Winthrop). Dedham was designated as the &quot;shire town&quot;. Hingham and Hull petitioned to remain in Suffolk County and on the day the law was to take effect, their removal to Norfolk County was repealed, making Cohasset an exclave. In 1803, they were moved into Plymouth County, Massachusetts.

On June 22, 1797, the town of Natick was given to Middlesex County, and the town of Needham was transferred from Middlesex to Norfolk. The towns of Dorchester and Roxbury were part of Norfolk County when it was created but, as Boston annexed each town in stages from 1804 to 1912, they became part of Suffolk County again, leaving Brookline separated from the rest of Norfolk County. No other changes have been made to the territory of Norfolk County, other than new municipalities being created within its boundaries, and minor border adjustments.

Norfolk County is the birthplace of four Presidents of the United States (John Adams, John Quincy Adams, John F. Kennedy, and George H. W. Bush), resulting in the moniker &quot;County of Presidents.&quot;

===Jails===
Following the creation of the county, Gay&#x27;s Tavern was the site of a Court of General Sessions on August 25, 1794. They ordered that the committee on buildings proceed with collecting materials for building a jail. On the last day of September following this order, the court accepted from Timothy Gay the gift of a parallelogram lot of land to erect the Norfolk County Jail next to his tavern. 

It was replaced by a new Norfolk County Jail in 1817. The two story stone building was built in 1817 and was 33&#x27; square. Part of the jail was torn down in 1851 to erect a central, octagonal portion and two wings. It resulted in a building with the shape of a Latin cross, and featured Gothic Revival windows. The three tiers of cells radiated out like spokes from the central guardroom. There were two hangings in the central rotunda: George C. Hersey on August 8, 1862 and James H. Costley on June 25, 1875.

Inmates were housed in the jail until 1992 when the Norfolk County Correctional Center was opened in 1992. A court forced the closure after 13 inmates escaped in 1989. There were at least 27 break outs during the prison&#x27;s history. 

The current Norfolk County Correctional Center is located on the median of Route 128 in Dedham. The facility has 502 beds and opened in 1992.

===Courthouses===
After the creation of the county, the Court of Common Pleas and the Court of General Sessions of the Peace first met in Dedham&#x27;s meetinghouse. Nathaniel Ames was chosen as the clerk of both and they met for the first time on September 23.

When the court met on January 7, 1794, it was so cold in the building, which lacked any sort of heating, that they moved to the Woodward Tavern across the street. The Anglican Church in town had also offered their building, but it was in such a state of disrepair that the offer was not accepted. The First Church and Parish in Dedham then offered a piece of land on their Little Common, and a new courthouse was ordered to be constructed. Construction was sluggish, however, and the delays frustrated Ames.

The court was still sitting in the meetinghouse in 1794 but the new courthouse was completed in 1795. It was found to be too small, however, and the ceilings were so low as to stifle people in the courtrooms. Charles Bulfinch was hired in 1795 to design a turret for the building and Paul Revere was commissioned to cast a bell.

When it became apparent that the Courthouse was out of date, the County Commissioners ordered a new one to be built. They originally were seeking a utilitarian building that would be fireproof and safe to store important documents. Local boosters, however, wanted a building that aligned with the town&#x27;s rapidly improving self-image.

The land for the courthouse, across the street from the existing one, was purchased from Frances Ames for $1,200. Ames later refused to sell the lot to the east at an asking price of $400, however. Masonic ceremonies, bell ringing and cannon fire accompanied the laying of the cornerstone on July 4, 1825. In 1827, the old courthouse was sold at public auction. 

The new building was designed by Solomon Willard and was dedicated on February 20, 1827. It was a basic rectangular granite-walled structure, 48&#x27; by 98&#x27; and two stories tall, with Greek-temple porticoes at either end. Each 10&#x27; portico was supported by four Doric pillars. A bell made by Paul Revere was moved from the old courthouse to the new north portico, where it was tolled to announce court sessions.

The interior had a hall running through the center paved with brick. On the eastern side were the offices of the Country Treasurer and the Clerk of Courts. On the western side were the Registry of Deeds and Probate Court. The courtroom was upstairs and featured an arched ceiling. The high sheriff had a desk in the room.

From the outside it was an attractive building, but it was not a comfortable place to work. The only water was provided by a well on Court Street, and it did not have an adequate heating system. One employee complained that it was &quot;barren and destitute of every convenience, demanded for health, comfort and decency.&quot; In 1846, an iron fence was installed around the perimeter.

===Registry of Deeds===

The Registry was originally housed in one of the first floor rooms of the home of Eliphalet Pond, the first registrar, at 963 Washington Street in Dedham. A sign was nailed to a tree out front informing the public of its location. It then moved to the original Norfolk County Courthouse and remained there for about three decades. When the new Norfolk County Courthouse was built in 1827, the middle office on the west side of the lower level was used by the Registry. When the population of the county grew and the number of real estate transactions increased apace, a new building was constructed for the Registry across the street at 649 High Street. The Boston firm Peabody &amp; Stearns was hired to design the current Registry of Deeds, built in 1905. The main section of the building measures 52 feet by 186 feet, is two stories high with a copper hipped roof, and is built of Indiana limestone with details made of granite from Deer Isle, Maine.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (11%) is water. It is the third-smallest county in Massachusetts by total area. The county is not completely contiguous; the towns of Brookline and Cohasset are each part of Norfolk County but are separated from the majority of Norfolk County (and each other) by either water or other counties. At the county&#x27;s formation, Hingham and Hull were to be part of it, but joined Plymouth County instead, leaving Cohasset as the initial exclave of Norfolk County and an enclave of Plymouth County. Brookline became the second exclave of Norfolk County in 1873 when the neighboring town of West Roxbury was annexed by Boston (thus leaving Norfolk County to join Suffolk County) and Brookline refused to be annexed by Boston after the Brookline-Boston annexation debate of 1873.

==Government and politics==

===Elected Officials===
Plymouth County is governed by three County Commissioners:

Chairman Jared L. Valanzola (R-Plymouth) 
, Commissioner Sandra M. Wright (R-Bridgewater),
and Commissioner Gregory M. Hanley (D-Abington)

Other county elected officials include Sheriff Joseph D. McDonald, Jr. (R-Kingston), District Attorney Timothy Cruz (R-Marshfield), Treasurer Thomas J. O&#x27;Brien (D-Plymouth), Register of Deeds John R. Buckley, Jr. (D-Scituate), Register of Probate Matthew McDonough (D-Marshfield), and Clerk of Courts Robert Creedon (D-Brockton)

===Presidential election results===

From 1876 to 1988, only three Democrats carried the county: Lyndon Johnson, Hubert Humphrey, and Jimmy Carter. Since 1992, however, it has become solidly Democratic, though less so relative to other counties in the state. In 2012, Mitt Romney lost the county by 4.2 points, the closest a Republican had come to winning a county in Massachusetts since 1988. However, it has become more Democratic afterwards, and in 2020, Joe Biden carried the county by 17 points, the largest margin of victory for a Democrat since 1996.

<text>Suffolk County ( ) is located in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, in the United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 797,936, making it the fourth-most populous county in Massachusetts. The county comprises the cities of Boston, Chelsea, and Revere, and the town of Winthrop. The traditional county seat is Boston, the state capital and the largest city in Massachusetts. The county government was abolished in 1999, resulting in Suffolk County now functioning only as an administrative subdivision of state government and a set of communities grouped together for some statistical purposes. Suffolk County is located at the core of the Boston-Cambridge-Newton, MA-NH Metropolitan Statistical Area as well as the greater Boston-Worcester-Providence, MA-RI-NH-CT Combined Statistical Area.

==History==

The county was created by the Massachusetts General Court on May 10, 1643, when it was ordered &quot;that the whole plantation within this jurisdiction be divided into four shires&quot;. Suffolk initially contained Boston, Roxbury, Dorchester, Dedham, Braintree, Weymouth, Hingham and Hull. The county was named after Suffolk, England, which means &quot;southern folk.&quot;

In 1731, the extreme western portions of Suffolk County, which included Mendon and Uxbridge, were split off to become part of Worcester County. In 1793, most of the original Suffolk County split off and became Norfolk County, leaving only Boston, Chelsea, Hingham, and Hull in Suffolk. Hingham and Hull would leave Suffolk County and join Plymouth County in 1803. Revere was set off from Chelsea and incorporated in 1846 and Winthrop was set off from Revere and incorporated in 1852. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, Boston annexed several adjacent cities and towns including Hyde Park, Roxbury, West Roxbury, and Dorchester from Norfolk County and Charlestown and Brighton from Middlesex County, resulting in an enlargement of Suffolk County.

During the early 20th century, County government functions were absorbed by the City of Boston, with Boston City Council becoming the de-facto County Commission, and the City Treasurer similarly becoming the County Treasurer, albeit said government was not formally abolished until 1999.

==Government and politics==
Like an increasing number of Massachusetts counties, Suffolk County exists today only as a historical geographic region, and has no county government. All former county functions were assumed by state agencies in 1999. The sheriff, district attorney, and some other regional officials with specific duties are still elected locally to perform duties within the county region, but there is no county council, executives or commissioners. Prior to the abolition of county government, the authority of the Suffolk County Commission had for many years been exercised by the Boston City Council, even though three communities in the county are not part of the city. However, communities are now granted the right to form their own regional compacts for sharing services.

Politically speaking, Suffolk County supports the Democratic Party overwhelmingly. No Republican presidential candidate has won there since Calvin Coolidge in 1924. In 2012 Barack Obama received 77.4% of the vote, compared to 20.8% for former governor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney. In the 2014 gubernatorial election, Martha Coakley carried the county by a 32.4% margin, while losing the election statewide by 48.4 to 46.5%. In 2020, Joe Biden won the county by the largest margin of any presidential candidate since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, and was the first candidate since then to win more than 80% of the vote in the county.
















===Sheriff&#x27;s department===
The Suffolk County Sheriff&#x27;s Department&#x27;s primary responsibility is oversight of the Nashua Street Jail and the South Bay House of Correction. These were built in the 1990s to replace the historic Charles Street Jail and Deer Island Prison, respectively. The Suffolk County Sheriff&#x27;s Department was among those named in a 2020 WBUR report about the neglect of inmates with medical conditions in Massachusetts prisons leading to their deaths.

Several notable figures in Massachusetts history were once the sheriff of Suffolk County:
*Joseph Hall (1818–1825)

<text>Worcester County ( ) is a county in the U.S. state of Massachusetts. At the 2020 census, the population was 862,111, making it the second-most populous county in Massachusetts. It is also the largest county in Massachusetts by geographic area. The largest city and traditional shire town is Worcester. Worcester County is part of the Worcester, MA–CT metropolitan statistical area and the Boston-Worcester-Providence combined statistical area.

==History==

Worcester County was formed from the eastern portion of colonial Hampshire County, the western portion of the original Middlesex County and the extreme western portion of the original Suffolk County. When the government of Worcester County was established on April 2, 1731, Worcester was chosen as its shire town (later known as a county seat). From that date until the dissolution of the county government, it was the only county seat. Because of the size of the county, there were fifteen attempts over 140 years to split the county into two counties, but without success.

Initially, Lancaster was proposed as the seat of the northern county; later, Petersham was proposed once and Fitchburg was proposed repeatedly, most recently in 1903. Perhaps as a concession, in August 1884 the Worcester County Registry of Deeds was split in two, with the Worcester Northern registry placed in Fitchburg.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (4.3%) is water.

It is the largest county in Massachusetts by area. The county is larger geographically than the entire state of Rhode Island even including Rhode Island&#x27;s water ocean limit boundaries. The county constitutes Central Massachusetts, separating the Greater Springfield area from the Greater Boston area. It stretches from the northern to the southern border of the state. The geographic center of Massachusetts is in Rutland.

Worcester County is one of two Massachusetts counties that borders three different neighboring states; (New Hampshire, Connecticut and Rhode Island); the other being Berkshire County. They are also the only two counties to touch both the northern and southern state lines.

==Government and politics==
Worcester County is one of the 8 (of the total of 14) Massachusetts counties that have had no county government or county commissioners since July 1, 1998, when county functions were assumed by state agencies at local option following a change in state law. The county has an elected county sheriff, county prosecutor, and court officials, administered under the state department of public safety. The state correctional system in the county is known as the Worcester County Jail or &quot;House of Corrections&quot; at West Boylston, and the Worcester County District courts (state administered) are housed at Worcester, Fitchburg, and other district courts within county boundaries. The Worcester County district attorney is a county-wide position even though the district includes one town from a neighboring county. In Massachusetts, Sheriffs have more limited roles than most states and are responsible for corrections, court service and bailiffs and jail release programs. County Sheriffs in Massachusetts are elected to six-year terms. The Worcester County Sheriff is Lewis Evangelidis (R), and the Worcester County District Attorney is Joseph Early Jr. (D) (see the info-box for elected officials at county level). The Worcester County Conservation District has countywide boundaries. The county has a regional planning commission.

Massachusetts law allows regional compacts, traditional counties and other governmental entities. Traditional County governments in the state include Norfolk, Bristol, Dukes, Nantucket, and Plymouth Counties. Barnstable County, which is Cape Cod, functions as a modern regional county government. Suffolk County, which is mainly Boston, is under the Boston City Council. The Massachusetts General Laws describe this relationship of county government and the options for abolishing county governments and/or chartering regional governmental compacts in subchapter 34 B. Four other new county compacts have been created by the state legislature in Hampshire, Franklin, Barnstable Counties, and a regional planning council level for Berkshire County. Thus 9 of 14 Counties have some form of county regional governments. Worcester County could exercise that option if it chooses, such as for public safety and/or preparedness due to its rather large geography, by a request to and a special act of the legislature, by local referendum, or by one of three mechanisms. See the references for the state statute, and the League of Women Voters link.

<text>The Bas-Saint-Laurent (, &#x27;Lower Saint-Lawrence) is an administrative region of Quebec located along the south shore of the lower Saint Lawrence River in Quebec. The river widens at this place, later becoming a bay that discharges into the Atlantic Ocean and is often nicknamed &quot;Bas-du-Fleuve&quot; (Lower-River). The region is formed by eight regional county municipalities and 114 municipalities. In the south, it borders Maine of the United States, and the Canadian New Brunswick and the regions of Chaudière-Appalaches and Gaspésie–Îles-de-la-Madeleine.

It had a population of 199,039 and a land area of as of the 2021 census.

The territory has evidence of human occupation since the Pleistocene by successive indigenous peoples. The historic First Nations occupied it all until European colonisation started in the late 17th century; France made land concessions to settlers under the Seigneurial system of New France to encourage colonization. However, development of this region was slow until it started to exploit its mixed forests. Settlement gradually developed further inland, on the littoral, and since the late 20th century a leisure and recreation industry has developed.

Its geography is marked by the Saint Lawrence River to the northwest, the Notre Dame Mountains section of the Appalachians, as well as the Matapédia and Témiscouata valleys, which forms the natural communication corridors with the Gaspé Peninsula, the state of Maine in the United States, and the Maritimes.

== Etymology and toponymy ==
The region takes its name from the Saint Lawrence River, a waterway that has a central role in the history of Quebec and forms the northern border of the region. The name of the river, and by extension the region, has a hagiotoponymic origin originating from the &quot;baye sainct Laurens&quot; named by Jacques Cartier, originating from the date of discovery being 10 August 1535, day of the festival of Saint Lawrence in the Christian martyrology. The name of the bay was used again to describe the river when the &quot;Narration&quot;, his report of his expedition, was translated to Spanish and Italian, and definitively fixed by its use in the world map of cartographer Gerardus Mercator in 1569, according to historian Marcel Trudel.

The name &quot;Bas-Saint-Laurent&quot;, however, only appeared much later. In their &quot;Histoire du Bas-Saint-Laurent&quot;, the historians Fortin and Lechasseur assert that the relation with the Saint Lawrence grew with the population of the region in the 19th century. The first mention of the name is attributed to a report from the Rimouskois deputy and writer Joseph-Charles Taché, which used the term to describe &quot;the two shores of the Bas-Saint-Laurent except the Gaspé district&quot;. The authors, however, write that Taché preferred most of the time to use more precise and well-known references, like the counties of Montmorency and Rimouski.
Even if the name of the region was present on a map made in 1863 by Stanislas Drapeau, it took time to settle in; the expression &quot;le Bas du Fleuve&quot; being preferred.

With the settlement of Témiscouata and la Matapédia, the name start imposing itself between 1920 and 1960, when a number of enterprises and organisms of the region delimitated by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Rimouski and Rivière-du-Loup, like the &quot;Compagnie de transport du Bas St-Laurent&quot; and the &quot;Compagnie de Pouvoir du Bas-Saint-Laurent&quot; or the newspaper &quot;l&#x27;Écho du Bas St-Laurent&quot; adopt it.

After being eclipsed for two decades when the State tried to erase regional differences by putting in place shared administrative structures east of the Quebec, the start of the 1980s sees this policy change, as the great region Bas-Saint-Laurent-Gaspésie is split into two different territories, being more accurate for the distinctive cultural traditions of these regions.

The evolution of the toponymy of the region takes root in the different steps of its development, with at first the initial settlement by First Nations, followed by a progressive settlement by French-speaking colonists starting in the 18th century, but mostly in the 19th, a small Scottish presence starting in the 1800s, with activities centred on agriculture and the exploitation of its waters and forests. The last phase of this evolution took place when some inland communities started to decline and its centres of activity were reinforced.

== Geography ==

=== Situation and political divisions ===

The Bas-Saint-Laurent is a region in the East of Quebec, delimited to the north by the Saint Lawrence River, to the south by New-Brunswick and Maine, to the east by the Gaspé Peninsula and to the west by Côte-du-Sud. It extends over an area of , with of land area, which represents a bit less than 2% of the total area of Quebec, however, this area also represents 10% of the inhabited area of Quebec, or about half the land area of Switzerland.

The region is divided into eight Regional county municipalities (RCM), which contain 130 municipalities. Bas Saint-Laurent contained 200,462 inhabitants in 2011, of which 55,400 were in its most populous RCM, Rimouski-Neigette. Otherwise, the least populous RCM of the region is Les Basques, with only 9,000 inhabitants in 2011, a number which decreased by 1,300 since 1996, making it also the RCM with the highest annual rate of population decrease of the region, with a rate of 9.6% between 2006 and 2011.

Forested areas and waterways dominate the land use of Bas-Saint-Laurent. The region counts of mixed forests, of coniferous forests and of waterways. Humid lands only covers and the land devoted to agriculture covers , while developed areas represent only , which equals to 0.5% of the total land area of the region.

=== Geology ===
Even if an isolated area of Cambrian and Precambrian rocks exist in an area of the Chic-Choc Mountains, the region belongs generally to the geologic province of the Appalachian Mountains, which covers an area of , between Alabama and Newfoundland. The marks of two episodes of mountain-building, the Acadian orogeny and the Taconic orogeny, have shaped the land.

During the first orogeny, the subduction of the oceanic plate created a volcanic chain in the Iapetus Ocean, off the coast of Laurentia during the Cambrian period. The magma surfacing mixed with the sediments originating from the continental erosion and the volcanic arc of islands got gradually closer to the continent to the subduction. The two collided 450 million years ago and formed a chain of immature mountains, the Taconic Mountains, their nappe covers a part of the Saint Lawrence Lowlands.

This first zone, which follows the river today, is known as Humber&#x27;s zone. Dating from the Ordovician, this bedrock is composed primarily of sedimentary rocks : sandstone, mudrocks and conglomerates. South of this zone, the Gaspé belt is the remnant of a second mountain formation during Siluro-Devonian times. Around 430 million years ago, the Taconic mountains eroded and created sediments that deposited at a shallow depth. As Laurentia and the micro-continent Avalonia deformed and raised the sedimentary deposits and volcanic rocks and created a second chain of mountains, the Acadian Chain, which superposes itself on the Taconic Chain.

=== Seismicity ===

The estuary of the Saint Lawrence river in front of the Charlevoix region is one of the most active seismic regions in the east of Canada. Five earthquakes of a magnitude superior to 6 have occurred in history, in February 1663, December 1791, October 1860, October 1870 and February 1925. The distribution of these earthquakes indicates a concentration in the estuary, near La Malbaie and Rivière-du-Loup.

Surveys and the establishment of a seismometer network were conducted in the 1970s and allowed to circumscribe the seismically active area in an area of on along the Saint Lawrence River, this zone includes the towns of La Malbaie, Baie-Saint-Paul and La Pocatière. The seismic data indicates that an earthquake happens on average every 36 hours in the Charlevoix-Kamouraska zone. They are concentrated in the Precambrian bedrock under the Logan line and the Appalachian Mountains, at a variable depth between deep and the surface

Another seismic area located in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, in a triangle between the towns of Matane, Baie-Comeau and Sept-Îles. However, this seismic area is less active than the one uphill, as only an average of sixty earthquakes occur each year and has not had a destructive earthquake in history. An earthquake of magnitude 5.1 occurred in 1944 east of Godbout and another of the same magnitude occurred on the 16 March 1999, its epicentre was located at about south of Sept-Îles.

=== Topography ===

The topography of Bas-Saint-Laurent has two main elements : the plateaus of the Appalachian Mountains, called Notre Dame Mountains, and the lowlands in the fine stripe of land along the Saint Lawrence river. These are separated by an intermediate area of ridges and foothills which meld with the plateaus. The Notre Dame Mountains, are a group of small mountains with summits reaching between high. the landscape is sometimes interrupted by valleys, like the Témiscouata valley or Matapedia Valley. These two parallel valleys allow access to The Maritimes, Maine and Chaleur Bay.

The littoral, spanning across is composed of riverside land of altitudes ranging from above sea level. This area has a depth of before reaching the mountains in the west of the region, but reaches in the vicinity of Rimouski, only to shrink again in the eastern limits of the region. This riverside land disappears entirely between the municipalities of Sainte-Félicité and Grosses-Roches. In the western part of the territory, this littoral plain is interrupted by inselbergs, ridges reaching that can reach 200m in height, typical of the riverside land of Bas-Saint-Laurent

In the Quaternary, the region was marked by glaciation. the Wisconsin glaciation caused the crust to sink by in the vicinity of Rimouski. When the end of the glaciation started in 18,000 BP, it opened a sound in the Saint-Laurent valley, isolating the glacier covering Bas-Saint-Laurent from the one covering Côte-Nord. The isostatic rebound created an inland sea, the Sea of Goldthwait, which flooded the region under at most 200m of water in the area around Rimouski.

The withdrawal of the Sea of Goldthwait was gradual, 2,000 years ago the isostatic rebound stabilised at around per year, the withdrawal of the water formed a number of narrow streaks of emerged land near the riverside between Rivière-du-Loup and Rimouski, known today as Île aux Lièvres, Île Verte, île aux Basques, île du Bic and île Saint-Barnabé.

=== Hydrography ===

The estuary of the Saint Lawrence river, to the north of the region, plays a primary role in the region. It is divided in two regions split at Cacouna: west of Cacouna, it is called a medium estuary, while east of the municipality it is called a maritime estuary or lower estuary.

The region is relatively poor in fresh water, since lakes and rivers only count as 1.5% of the land area. It possesses two hydrographic regions, the first holds all the streams that pour into the estuary of the Saint-Lawrence river and the region of Chaleur Bay and Percé, whose streams flow south into New-Brunswick and Maine. These regions influenced the layout of the administrative areas of Bas-Saint-Laurent, by setting limits to some regional county municipalities.

The largest drainage basins of the region are located in the south of the territory. These are the drainage basins of the Matapedia River () and Madawaska River (). Ranking third, the drainage basin of the Cascapédia River of , half of this basin is located within the limits of the administrative region. Among the notable rivers pouring into the Saint-Lawrence, we can count the Mitis River (), Matane River (), Rimouski River (), Rivière du Loup () and Trois Pistoles River ().

Bas-Saint-Laurent counts 2,417 lakes, of which 90% do not exceed an area of . About 30% of them are situated in the RCM of Rimouski-Neigette. The two largest lakes of the region are Lake Témiscouata () and Lake Matapedia (), significant human settlement on their shore has taken place, as well as along the roads going through their valleys. These lakes also distinguish themselves by their north west and south west orientation, compared to most of the other lakes of the region which prefer to follow the orientation of the creases and breaks of the Appalachian Mountains.

=== Climate ===

Bas-Saint-Laurent, like the rest of Quebec, is a Nordic American territory. The Quebecois geographer Louis-Edmond Hamelin categorized the region in his pre-north area, second of the five zones of his map of nordicity zones.

The oceanic influence of the estuary of the Saint Lawrence River has a small influence on the climate of the region, making it more alike to the climate of meridional Quebec, than with &quot;Nordic&quot; towns like La Sarre in Abitibi or Roberval, Quebec in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, located at the same latitude than the town of Matane. However, the climate of Bas-Saint-Laurent is of continental type, with a &quot;great amplitude and no dry periods&quot;.

The French geographer Raoul Blanchard described the temperature variations between winter and summer as &quot;brutal&quot;. During the winter, which lasts for five months, the cold freezes the lakes and rivers and transforms the estuary into a &quot;vast prairie of ice&quot;.

The oceanic influence, while it mitigates the cold of the winters, cools the summers. The average temperature in July in Rimouski inferior by 4 degrees to the one recorded in Quebec. To this, the wind of the north west adds humidity and cold.

Rainfall is abundant and consistent throughout the year. The region currently receives annually of rainfall, of which between is snow. The oceanic influence is less present inland, where slightly warmer temperatures in the summer and slightly colder in the winter are recorded.

== Natural environment ==

=== Flora ===

Bas-Saint-Laurent is part of the natural province of the Appalachian Mountains in the ecological reference area of Quebec. The forests of Bas-Saint-Laurent are 8,000 years old. Beyond inhabited areas, they cover the majority of the territory. They are boreal with a coniferous influence. The forests most important in order of superficy are those of golden birch, paper birch and white spruce.

The dominant forest of the territory is composed of golden birch trees, an Ecotone marking the transition between the temperate nordique area and the boreal area. It is located mainly in the highest part of the Appalachian plateau. The main species of trees within it are the paper birch, the balsam fir, and the white spruce, as well as rarer quaking aspens and jack pines. The second forest in superficy is composed of primarily golden birch, and covers 35% of the forested area of the region. It is mainly located in the centre of Bas-Saint-Laurent between Rivière-du-Loup and Rimouski. The main species of trees within it are the golden birch, balsam fir, white spruce, red spruce and the cedar, as well as rarer quaking aspens, paper birches, balsam poplars and mountain maple.

However, a more profound analysis of the composition of the forests of Bas-Saint-Laurent allows to shed light on which trees grow at which elevations, type of soils and latitudes. Miroslav Grandtner categorized the south west end of the region, the littoral stripe before Rivère-du-Loup and the medium plateau in the golden birch forest, the high plateau as part of the paper birch forest, and finally, the Chic-Choc Mountains as part of the white spruce forest.

=== Fauna ===

The fauna of Bas-Saint-Laurent is similar to the one found in other parts of Quebec and has a relatively poor diversity in species. The glacial episodes of the Pleistocene drove away the animals of the ice-covered area and these came back gradually as the ice sheet melted over the last 18,000 years.

The melting of the ice sheet and the flood of the sea of Goldthwait around the current estuary brought molluscs like true mussels, soft-shell clams and scallops. belugas and other whales visit it. According to the remains of marine mammals found in altitude further inland, narvals, walruses and earless seals were also present in the region.

On land, the eider appears around 18,000 BP and a mastodon closely related to the mammoth inhabited the area before disappearing 8000 years ago. Today, the region is dominated by the big game moose, white-tailed deer and black bear. The small game is composed of the ruffed grouse, the spruce grouse and snowshoe hare. The muskrat, North American beaver and red fox are also usual sights in the forests of Bas-Saint-Laurent.

Many species of birds live along the estuary of Saint Lawrence. The Canada goose, snow goose and brant do a halt in the tidal marshes located along the litoral between La Pocatière and Pointe-au-Père. Diverse types of duck are present, like the American black duck, Northern pintail, two types of surface duck. Diving ducks are represented by the common goldeneye and ring-necked duck, while sea ducks are represented by the common eider and long-tailed duck.

=== Environmental protection ===

Bas-Saint-Laurent has only one wetland area according to the Ramsar Convention, the Baie de l&#x27;Isle-Verte, part of it is protected by the national wildlife reserve of baie de L&#x27;Isle-Verte. This swamp is primarily occupied by cordgrasses and is an important nesting area for the American black duck, as well as a stop for migratory birds in spring.

The region has four national parks. The Lac-Témiscouata National Park is located east of the Lake Témiscouata and protects a representative part of the Notre Dame Mountains and several ancient forests. The Bic National Park, near Rimouski, protects the litoral of the south of the estuary of Saint Lawrence. The Gaspésie National Park, of which only a small part is within the limits of the region, is characterized by several summits taller than . Its diverse climate and its landscape host a flora unique in Quebec. Finally, about 30% of the Saguenay–St. Lawrence Marine Park, the first marine park of Quebec, is located in the region. It holds the longest fjord in the east of Canada as well as a part of the largest estuary in the world, which makes it a location of considerable marine biodiversity. It is the only park administered in Canada by both the Government of Quebec and Government of Canada.

Three other parks, ecological reserves, more restricted protected areas, are located in the centre of the region, the reserves of Fernald, Charles-B.-Banville and Irène-Fournier. At the same level of protection, there are six floristic parks, most of them within the Gaspésie National Park.

The largest protected areas of the region are those protected by the confinement areas of the white-tailed deer. Just these protected areas cover nearly 80% of the protected area of the region. Bas-Saint-Laurent contains about 27% of the protected areas of this designation. The second largest designation by superficy are the protected areas devoted to the protection of aquatic birds, of which a large part () are in a marine environment.

Although they are not strictly considered protected areas, the territories structured for the gestion of wildlife cover 45,5% of the surface area of the region. They are divided in four wildlife reserves and five Zone d&#x27;exploitation contrôlée.

== Demography ==

After reaching its peak in the middle of the 20th century due to the strong natality and a reduction of child mortality, the population of Bas-Saint-Laurent has declined over the last 50 years. This is not unique to the region, as the population living on the south shore of the estuary, in the regions of Côte-du-Sud, Bas-Saint-Laurent and Gaspésie, proportionally declined from 9.3 to 5.4% of the total population of Quebec between 1951 and 1991. This decline is due to structural issues like the rationalization of agriculture and the depletion of the forests, but also to rural flight and a declining birth rate since the 1960s.

=== Population ===

Bas-Saint-Laurent was home to 200,500 inhabitants on the first of July 2011, which represents 2.5% of the total population of Quebec. This number indicates that this share has dropped by 4% since 1996. More than 40% of the population of the region lives in two RCMs, Rimouski-Neigette (55,364 inhabitants in 2011) and Rivière-du-Loup (34,326 inhabitants in 2011).

Since 1951, the region has seen its population stagnate or slightly decline. This is due to two opposing factors, the decline of rural areas and the reinforcement of urban areas, like Rimouski and Rivière-du-Loup. The share of these two towns alone went from 16% of the total population of the region in 1951 to 34% in 2001. The new importance of these urban centres explain the fact that only their RCMs have had a population increase between 1951 and 2001. Opposite to these, RCMs devoid of a strong urban centre, like La Matapédia, Témiscouata and Les Basques, have been the RCMs where the population has dropped the most in the region.

Accounting for the population decrease observed since 1951, even when Quebec&#x27;s population has increased by 82%, it is not surprising that the share of the population of Quebec living in Bas-Saint-Laurent has decreased from 5.2% in 1951 to 2.8% in 2001.

=== Age ===
The population of Bas-Saint-Laurent is significantly older than the population of Quebec as a whole. In 2011, the average age of the population of Bas-Saint-Laurent was 47.3 years, making it the second oldest province of Quebec by that criterion, behind neighboring Gaspésie–Îles-de-la-Madeleine (49.0 years) and just before the region in third place, Mauricie (47.2).

The share of youths under the age of 20 is also one of the lowest of Quebec, at 19.5%, compared to the average of 21.7%.

As is the case for data on population, the data on the age of said population shows a clear divide between the two urban RCMs and the rural ones. The RCM Les Basques sees an important aging of its population and has the lowest share of youths between 0 and 19 years old (17.5), the population over 65 years old has the largest share (25.6%), and the average age of 51 years is the highest of the region in 2011.

=== Language ===

Nearly all residents of Bas-Saint-Laurent speak French as their mother tongue. According to the 2006, 98.6% of those who responded declared their native tongue to be French, 0.6% declared English, and 0.8% listed a different language. Only 315 people indicated both French and English to be their native tongues, and 86 people cited French and another language.

The proportion of Bas-Saint-Laurent residents reporting they can speak both French and English was 15.6%, compared to 40.6% in all of Quebec. This share was greater in the two largest cities of the region, reaching 21.7% in Rimouski and 18.0% in Rivière-du-Loup. Among smaller towns, Notre-Dame-du-Lac stood out with a bilingual rate of 20.3%. In the region, 140 people reported they only spoke English, and 125 others reported that they could not speak either French or English.

=== Immigration ===
The regional conference of elected representatives considers immigration to be a major issue for the economic and social development of Bas-Saint-Laurent and expends great efforts to attract new inhabitants, it also creates programs of insertion and promotion for them. Bas-Saint-Laurent welcomed 585 immigrants between 2001 and 2006, which is about 30% of the 2000 inhabitants who migrated there according to the 2006 census. The RCM of Rimouski-Neigette welcomed more than half (310) of the new arrivals in the region between 2001 and 2006

These numbers must however be put in relation to the fact that 77.3% of the 236,975 immigrants to settle in Quebec between 1998 and 2007 chose the metropolitan region of Montréal, Bas-Saint-Laurent received only 0.2% of the immigrants that came to Quebec during this period. 
=== Demographic projection ===
According to the most recent demographic projection from the Institut de la statistique du Québec, the population of Bas-Saint-Laurent will register a slight decline to 198,600 in 2031. According to this prediction, the proportion of inhabitants above 65 years old should reach 36% and will be twice as large as the share of inhabitants between 0 and 19 years old. This demographic prediction settles that the average age of the population of Bas-Saint-Laurent would reach 53 years, an increase of 6% compared to the latest data. The positive net migration rate will be insufficient in countering the negative rate of natural increase of the population.

== History ==

=== Prehistory and proto-history ===

The first inhabitants of the area that is now known as Bas-Saint-Laurent lived on the shore of the estuary soon after the glaciers melted Archeological excavations between 1980 and 1990 around Bic and Rimouski indicate an amerindian presence during the Paleoindian, between 9,000 and 8,000 BP years, according to Pierre Dumais and Gilles Rousseau. and between 10,000 and 8,000 BP years according to Claude Chapdelaine.

Paleoindian sites discovered on an ancient beach above and a sea shelf contained stone tools and lithic flakes, indicating an industry belonging to the Plano culture. These nomads inhabited the region and practiced a hunter-gatherer lifestyle.

A second period, the Archaic covers about 5,000 years and starts at around 7,000 BP to end 2,500 years ago in the south of Quebec. In 1977, researchers listed 19 sites in the region; six near the estuary and thirteen inland. The Archaic Period is characterised by nomad populations using various methods to use more efficiently the resources of the land. The sites are often located near small lakes or along rivers like the Touladi River in the Témiscouata. The artifacts discovered seem to indicate these groups preferred hunting rather than fishing.

Four sites are located in the Bic National Park. The most ancient, dated at around 4,000 years old, is located on the east shore of the Orignal&#x27;s Cape. It is an old abandoned marine shelf abandoned 1,000 years ago by the Sea of Goldthwait. Aside from tools and lithic flakes, archeologists also found broken and heated stones, sign that the inhabitants created hearths with which they cooked food and maybe smoked the meat.

=== Basque people ===

Just like the Normands and the Bretons, Basque fishermen started exploiting the marine ressources of the estuary and gulf of the Saint Lawrence in the 16th century. Their presence is confirmed as early as the 1520s and becomes more frequent right after the expeditions of Jacques Cartier.

Around 1560, the Basque own a fleet of a hundred cod-fishers and thirty whalers. They first exploit the abundant ressources present in the estuary and the banks of Newfoundland, but around 1570, it seems the reduced numbers of whale colonies push them to search for them all the way to the medium estuary of the Saint Lawrence.

The hunt is mainly located at the level of the chasse Saguenay fjord. L&#x27;île aux Basques, located in front of Trois-Pistoles, on the south shore of the Saint Lawrence River, it becomes a privileged place for the Basque to skin the whales captured in the area and melt their fat. Three furnaces still stand to remind us of this activity.

=== Slow colonization of the littoral ===
Even if under French rule, more than twenty segnories were granted along the bank of the river, all the way to Métis, and even inland (the segnories of Madawaska, Lac-Mitis and Lac-Matapédia), the settlement of Bas-Saint-Laurent remains sparse until 1790. With the exception of Kamouraska, which had a quicker colonization, in the prolongation of Côte-du-Sud and the royal path, Bas-Saint-Laurent remains isolated. When conquered, around 1760, the population east of Kamouraska is composed of a couple dozen families of pioneers and is concentrated in four seignories : Rivière-du-Loup, Isle-Verte, Trois-Pistoles and Rimouski. In 1790, Bas-Saint-Laurent, with the exception of Kamouraska, is home to barely 1250 inhabitants spread across hundreds of kilometers of shore, between Notre-Dame-du-Portage and Matane.

The construction of the Chemin du Portage around 1783 which allowed to link the valley of the Saint-Laurent with the British colonies of the Maritimes, which makes the area less isolated, but doesn&#x27;t induce any permanent settlement alongside its path.

Between 1790 and 1831, the population of Bas-Saint-Laurent in the old county of Rimouski (east of Kamouraska) goes from 1,000 to 10,000 inhabitants. The one of the county of Kamouraska nearly triples by changing from 5,500 to 15,000 inhabitants. This increase in population is due to both a strong natural growth and migration from more western regions. This settlement allows a nearly continuous exploitation of the Ribbon farms on the banks of the river in some places and the establishment of the first farms inland. Around Cacouna, in 1831, the settlement has already progressed enough to reach the fourth layer of farms. It is also around this time that the isolation is broken: in 1830, one can go to Rimouski by the royal path.

The years which follow the conquest are full of hardship for the catholic clergy. Even if the population justify it, the bishop struggles to make the British authorities recognize the new parishes. The first parish of Bas-Saint-Laurent east of Kamouraska is Cacouna, created in 1825, a century and a half after the arrival of the first &quot;un siècle et demi après l&#x27;arrivée des premiers&quot; pioneers. Even if a number of families of Scottish origin settle in the area in the 1820s in the region of, following John MacNider, however the French-speaking population will remain the strong majority of the region.

=== End of isolation ===

The region&#x27;s population increased from 400 inhabitants in 1829 to 11,169 in 1881. Three factors explain this rise. First, the development of agriculture in the lowlands is booming. Second, entrepreneurs like William Price establish sawmills which creates opportunities of employment for factory and forest workers, favorable trade with the United Kingdom and the United States allows this industry to profit with their exports finally, Rimouski turns into a regional centre of services with the establishment of a courthouse in 1862, the creation of the diocese of Rimouski in 1867 and the opening of a seminar in 1871.

The development of transportation, in particular the service assured by the Intercolonial Railway since 1873, creates a boom in trade and pushes agriculture to specialize in dairy production. Taking advantage of the large supply of lumber inland, the enterprise Price Brothers and Company builds a large sawmill at the mouth of the Rimouski River in 1899. The Great Depression of the 1930s reduces lumber demand and forces part of the population to migrate further inland; the colonization period between 1880 and 1930 sees a number of failures leading to the closure of a number of plusieurs échecs menant à la fermeture de parishes due to the exodus of their inhabitants. with the creation of the colonies of Esprit-Saint, de La Trinité-des-Monts et de Saint-Eugène-de-Ladrière, the inhabited area reaches its maximum.

In May 1950, a fire in the sawmill of the Price Brothers spreads over large parts of Rimouski and forces the region to re-allocate its resources towards services. The development of the mining, forestry and hydroelectric industries in Côte-Nord allows entrepreneurs like Jules-A. Brillant to develop a bustling business in the sectors of communication, transportation, wholesale and construction. With renewed involvement of the state after the Quiet Revolution, Rimouski affirms itself as the capital of the region and its service center. This change in the regional economy will negatively impact the hinterland, whose population reinforces Rimouski and the neighboring towns, like Saint-Anaclet-de-Lessard and the old municipalities of Le Bic, Rimouski-Est and Pointe-au-Père.

=== Contemporary period ===
In reaction to this rural flight, the federal and provincial governments establish in the 1960s, a test program of spatial planning in the regions of Gaspésie and Bas-Saint-Laurent. The Bureau d&#x27;aménagement de l&#x27;Est du Québec (BAEQ) is created in 1963 and the planners work for three years on a plan to raise the quality of life of the population by notably improving the mobility and formation of the workforce. The second part of the plan is the closure of villages in the hinterland of Bas-Saint-Laurent and the relocation of thousands inhabitants.

A movement of protest, the Opérations Dignité, are organized between 1970 and 1972 in the communities affected by the plan by the priests of their respective parishes. The first of these operations takes place in the hinterland of Matane and in the Matapédia Valley, followed by a second in the hinterland of Rimouski and in Témiscouata and a third in the east end of Gaspésie. In response to these protests the governments reconsiders the plan and cancels the closure of these villages.

In the early 1980s, the government of Quebec decentralizes its spatial planning and grants to the regions a part of the responsibility in the management policies of their territory. The old county councils created after the abolition of the seigniorial system, in 1855, are turned into regional county municipalities (RCM) in 1982 and are granted the responsabilité of the spatial planning of the territory.

Noting the failure of a forced merger of the two regions in the 1960s, the administrative region of Bas-Saint-Laurent-Gaspésie-Îles-de-la-Madeleine is divided by the government in December 1987. The new administrative region of Bas-Saint-Laurent keeps roughly the eastern border that was created in 1788 during the first carving of the territory for administrative purposes. In this new region, the RCM of Kamouraska becomes the eighth RCM of the region.

In 2012, the region contains 130 municipalities of which 114 belong to the administrative class of local municipalities grouped in eight RCM. the number of municipalities has been in a constant drop for 25 years. It went from 145 in 1986 to 135 in 1996. Six of these RCM have direct access to the estuary of the Saint Lawrence de ces MRC, the two others (La Matapédia and Témiscouata) are entirely landlocked.

Fourteen unorganized areas, most of which are uninhabited, do not belong to any municipality. These areas, which contain 37% of the land area of the region, are administered by the RCM which are responsible of the local services.

There also exist two Indian reserves under the jurisdiction of the Maliseet First Nation of Viger. The bureau of the community stands on an area of 0.17 hectare, located alongside the river Cacouna, while an area of , located along the route 185 in a forested area of the canton of Kataskomiq, holds the function of a meeting point for the community. The two territories do not possess any permanent inhabitants.

==== Cities ====
===== Rimouski =====
As a service centre, the city of Rimouski is the main urban centre of Bas-Saint-Laurent, located on the south bank of the St. Lawrence, east of Quebec City. Located away from the capital of the nation, the city is the economic, social and cultural metropolis of the region. A number of major regional institutions, like Université du Québec à Rimouski, the cégep de Rimouski, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Rimouski, the courthouse, the federal and provincial public administration, the seat of a number of companies and the regional hospital of Rimouski, the most important hospital centre of eastern Quebec, are located there.

With a population of 47,687 inhabitants in 2012, this new city created in 2002, as part of the municipal reorganizations which occurred across Quebec. In this reorganization the city of Rimouski was fused with the municipalities of Rimouski-Est, Pointe-au-Père, Sainte-Odile-sur-Rimouski, Sainte-Blandine and Mont-Lebel. Another process of municipal fusion added the municipality Le Bic to the city on the 16 of September 2009. The area of the new city covers and extends itself along the route 132 and the river on .

===== Rivière-du-Loup =====
Rivière-du-Loup is the second most important city of Bas-Saint-Laurent. The main concurrent of Rimouski, the city houses 19,695 inhabitants in 2012. It is the result of the merging of Rivière-du-Loup with the municipality of the parish of Saint-Patrice-de-la-Rivière-du-Loup.

===== Matane =====
The city of Matane is the third-largest city of the region by population. Granted as a fief and seigniory to Mathieu D&#x27;Amours in 1667 when it was a trading post of the fur trade and a fishing port, it is also the easternmost city of Bas-Saint-Laurent. Matane is sometimes considered as part of Gaspésie, like in the tourism sector where it is part of the touristic region of Gaspésie. Two small neighboring municipalities, Petit-Matane and Saint-Luc-de-Matane were appended to the city in 2001. Matane was home to 14,504 inhabitants in 2012.

===== Other cities =====

Mont-Joli (6,673 inhabitants in 2012) is a turning plate of transportation in eastern Quebec. It is the eastern end of the autoroute 20 since 2008, The city contains a train station and Mont-Joli Airport operating regular flights to Montreal, Quebec, Côte-Nord and the Magdalen Islands. A foundry and transformation factories of goods taken from the forest are the main employers of the city.

Located at the confluence of the Matapédia and Humqui rivers, Amqui (6,292 inhabitants in 2012) is the most important town of the Matapedia Valley and the administrative centre of RCM of La Matapédia. Founded in 1907, the exploitation of the surrounding forest long constituted the main activity of the city. Today, the forestry industry of Matapedia seeks to optimize their use of the wood with projects to develop the use of the residual biomass for energetic ends and the production of goods of second and third transformation in collaboration with the Service de recherche et d’expertise en transformation des produits forestiers (SEREX), an entity attached to the cégep de Rimouski.

Témiscouata-sur-le-Lac (5,085 inhabitants in 2012), is the result of the fusion of the towns of Cabano and Notre-Dame-du-Lac in 2010. This administrative centre of the RCM of Témiscouata, like the rest of its RCM, owes its wealth principally to agriculture, the maple syrup industry and forestry. Since 1976, the factory Norampac owned by the company Cascades which manufactures corrugated fiberboard and a manufacturer of prefabricated homes are established in the municipality.

La Pocatière (4,242 inhabitants in 2012) is the largest city of the RCM of Kamouraska. Seat of the Diocese of Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pocatière, of the cégep de La Pocatière and one of the two campuses of the Institut de technologie agroalimentaire, the city has had a strong agricultural sector since the end of the 17th century. Its economy benefits from the presence of a factory assembling rolling stocks owned by the company Bombardier Transportation.

Trois-Pistoles (3,471 inhabitants in 2012) is the administrative centre of the RCM Les Basques, the least populated of the eight RCMs of Bas-Saint-Laurent. Its economy is dominated by agriculture and tourism.

===Representation and political tendencies===
Since the modification of the electoral map of Quebec in 2011, three constituencies are entirely located inside the region of Bas-Saint-Laurent: Matane-Matapédia, Rimouski et Rivière-du-Loup–Témiscouata. The voters of the western part of the region are part of the constituency of Côte-du-Sud, shared between the regions of Bas-Saint-Laurent and Chaudière-Appalaches.

The Maliseet are also represented by the Maliseet First Nation of Viger.

==== Provincial representation ====
The region is represented in the National Assembly of Quebec since the 2014 Quebec general election by :

* Matane-Matapédia : Pascal Bérubé (PQ)
*Rimouski : Harold LeBel (PQ).
* Rivière-du-Loup–Témiscouata : Jean D&#x27;Amour (QLP)
* Côte-du-Sud : Norbert Morin (QLP).

With the exception of Rimouski&#x27;s, all constituencies voted &quot;no&quot; during the 1980 Quebec referendum. In 1992, the five constituencies of Bas-Saint-Laurent refused the Charlottetown Accord. Three years later, every constituency votes &quot;yes&quot; to the 1995 Quebec referendum.

==== Federal representation ====
Bas-Saint-Laurent is represented in the House of Commons of Canada since the 2021 Canadian federal election by :

* Rimouski-Neigette—Témiscouata—Les Basques, situated entirely within the adminastrative region: Maxime Blanchette-Joncas (BQ);
* Montmagny—L&#x27;Islet—Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup, including voters from Chaudière-Appalaches: Bernard Généreux (CPC);
* Avignon—La Mitis—Matane—Matapédia, also contains voters from the region of Gaspésie–Îles-de-la-Madeleine: Kristina Michaud (BQ).

== Economy ==

The economy of Bas-Saint-Laurent was long dominated by two traditional industries: agriculture and forestry, with, in keeping with the location, additional fishing and tourism industries, including indigenous fishing. The fishing industry traditionally exploited mostly species like the cod, the herring, and the eel; this was supplemented by the harvest of crustaceans and seaweed. This last good was either exported to the United States or used locally to produce mattresses and cushions. While agriculture was first only present in the narrow valley near the banks of the river, forestry was already a critical industry in the mid-1800s, and expands in the plateaus of the hinterland later on.

Since the start of the 20th century, the region is turning towards the second and third transformations of its resources and is attempting to create new markets, notably in marine technology and biotechnology, environmentally friendly construction and peat usage. Like in the rest of Quebec, the economy of the region is dominated by small and medium companies, as 96% employ less than 50 people.

=== Gross domestic product and disposable income ===
Often considered as a resource well by the government of Quebec, Bas-Saint-Laurent possesses a strong divide between its four industrial centers, Rimouski, Rivière-du-Loup, La Pocatière and Matane, as these benefited from the growth of the knowledge and high tech industry to assure their development and the smaller communities outside of these industrial centers often depending on a single industry from sectors in difficulty.

The Institut de la statistique du Québec reports that the gross domestic product of the region was of 5 billions in 2009, registering a growth of 1.3% compared to the previous year. The growth of the service economy is the main factor in this growth, and it now represents 70% of the regional economy, a figure close to the 71.6% of Quebec as a whole. In the good production sector, traditional industries register a sharp decline, as forestry declines by 25%, while the industries transforming wood and the paper industry declined by more than 12%.

The GDP per capita of the region was at $30,376 in 2010, which puts Bas-Saint-Laurent at the 13th place among the 17 Administrative regions of Quebec. The disposable and discretionary income was at $29,069. Excluding the amount taken by direct taxation and non-wage labour costs, the income per capita is at $23,044, the smallest income in Quebec after the neighbouring region of Gaspésie–Îles-de-la-Madeleine.

Each inhabitant of Bas-Saint-Laurent receives an average of $7,021 from the state, an amount superior the average of $5878 in Quebec. The unemployment rate being above Quebec&#x27;s average and the larger share of the population eligible to receive benefits from the government program of Old Age Security and Retraite Quebec explain this more generous welfare.

Statistics on the regional level do hide significant differences between the two most urbanized RCMs, Rimouski-Neigette and Rivière-du-Loup and the six others, who are more rural. The average disposable income in the RCM of Rimouski being $25,165, this is 20% more than in the RCMs of Témiscouata ($20,306) and La Matapédia ($20,603).

=== Employment ===
Even Bas-Saint-Laurent is located at the 13th place among the 17 regions of Quebec in GDP per capita, it sports an unemployment rate of 8.0% in 2011, a figure in decline of 2% compared to the previous year. The share of the workforce in the population is at 58.7% and the employment rate is at 54.1%, a figure which has risen by 0.5% since 2010. This growth can be explained by the reduced share of the population in working age which dropped by 1,400, but as well by a slight growth of 800 new available jobs. The 90,200 employed men and women of the region have only a slight divide in employment rate and nearly a quarter of them (21,800) work in industries producing goods.

A study performed in 2009 by the Secor firm notes that the decline of the population under 20 years old combined with the timid growth of the workforce and the drop of the unemployment rate will create a workforce shortage in the coming years. The signs of this new reality in the workforce are already apparent, as Secor notes, taking as an example the thirty programs of professional and technic formations that struggle to recruit enough students.

=== Primary sector ===
==== Agriculture and food industry ====

The land area devoted to agriculture in the region covered in 2005, which is around 15.6% of its land area and contributed to more than 6% of its gross domestic product. This industry is mainly located in the plain following the banks of the river and in the foothills of the valleys of Témiscouata and Matapédia.

In 2007, the dairy production had the largest share among all regional agricultural productions with 50% of the revenue, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. In this industry, a reinforcement of the activities can be observed with a reduction of the number of independent companies but with a global growth of 12% of the milk quotas between 1997 and 2007. The region takes first place in sheep farming, with 32% of all lambs produced in Quebec in 2007. Bas-Saint-Laurent also practices beef cattle farming and pig farming.

The maple syrup industry is in growth, as the cuts increased from 3.7 to 6.3 million between 1997 and 2007. The industry producing small fruits like the strawberry, the raspberry, the blueberry is stagnant, and the land area devoted to the growth of cereal grew by 10%, while the one devoted to the market garden industry shrunk.

==== Forestry industry ====

The forestry industry of Bas-Saint-Laurent took a hard hit during the American housing market crisis and the ensuing decrease in new projects, as these hit a roof of 500 000 in 2009. Even as new housing projects start to reappear and factories start producing more once again, the industry still continues to turn itself to non traditional markets and tries to sell smaller-diameter softwood logs.

==== Peat industry ====
The peat industry of Bas-Saint-Laurent extracts around 45% of the peat production of Quebec and builds specialized transformation tools de tourbe. There are around twenty companies in this industry that employ 1 500 and export 80% of their. Lately, this industry has made a great effort in converging with the agroenvironnemental industry, in fields like biofiltration, composting, agriculture and horticulture

Around 2002, a number of initiatives were taken by the producers of the industry and the government of Quebec to develop the industry. The producers managed to perform a life-cycle assessment of the peat and experiment new processes to rehabilitate commercially exploited bogs.

=== Secondary sector ===
With the recession caused by the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States, the wood manufacturing industry, most important manufacturing industry of the region, suffered greatly due to its inability to export in this market, but should recover along with the American economy. Some niches, like biomass valorization, might heal this industry, as well as it turning to new markets.

Other industries benefit from a favorable economic climate. This is notably the case for Enercon and other companies of the wind industry in Matane and the factory of Bombardier Transportation at La Pocatière, which will fulfill an assembly contract of rolling stocks for the cities of Montreal and New York.

=== Tertiary sector ===
The tertiary sector of Bas-Saint-Laurent today comprises the majority of the employed population everywhere in the region, but the four main cities of the region, Rimouski, Rivière-du-Loup, La Pocatière and Matane, hold the majority of the employment in the sector, and all the regional institutions and infrastructure are mostly located there.

==== Tourism industry ====
The administrative region of Bas-Saint-Laurent is divided into two areas of tourism administration and promotion. The six western RCM form the touristic region of Bas-Saint-Laurent, while the RCMs of Matane and La Matapédia are part of the touristic region of the Gaspé Peninsula.

Tourism is an important source of seasonal employment in the region, which possesses a few important tourist attraction sites.
* Jardins de Métis
* Site historique maritime de la Pointe-au-Père
* Pointe-au-Père National Wildlife Area
* Lac-Témiscouata National Park
* Bic National Park

==== Transportation ====
Most of Bas-Saint-Laurent&#x27;s car traffic transits through three highways: the Autoroute 20, which goes throughout the region west of Mont-Joli, with the exception of a section between L&#x27;Isle-Verte and Le Bic, Autoroute 85 and Route 185 passing through Témiscouata by the north-west of New Brunswick as well as the Route 132, which surrounds Gaspé Peninsula east of Sainte-Flavie. A fourth important road links Matane and Amqui by following the Matane River.

Two road projects are being carried out.

The road-work has been ongoing since 2002 with the goal of turning Route 185 into a motorway. The first phase of the project was part of a program aiming to improve road safety and was completed in 2011. The second phase should lengthen the motorway by and should be concluded between the fall of 2013 and 2015. The last phase of the road-work linking Saint-Antonin to Saint-Louis-du-Ha! Ha! with a length of being worked on was authorized by the government in 2011. The third phase is expected by the Ministère des Transports, de la Mobilité durable et de l&#x27;Électrification des Transports du Québec to be completed by 2025.

<doc id="76222" wikidata="Q1331256" url="?curid=76222" title="Flaviviridae">
<text>Flaviviridae is a family of enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses which mainly infect mammals and birds. They are primarily spread through arthropod vectors (mainly ticks and mosquitoes). The family gets its name from the yellow fever virus; &quot;flavus&quot; is Latin for &quot;yellow&quot;, and yellow fever in turn was named because of its propensity to cause jaundice in victims. There are 89 species in the family divided among four genera. Diseases associated with the group include: hepatitis (hepaciviruses), hemorrhagic syndromes, fatal mucosal disease (pestiviruses), hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, and the birth defect microcephaly (flaviviruses).

== Structure ==
Virus particles are enveloped and spherical with icosahedral-like geometries that have pseudo T=3 symmetry. They are about 40–60 nm in diameter.

==Genome==

Members of the family &quot;Flaviviridae&quot; have monopartite, linear, single-stranded RNA genomes of positive polarity, and 9.6 to 12.3 kilobase in total length. The 5&#x27;-termini of flaviviruses carry a methylated nucleotide cap, while other members of this family are uncapped and encode an internal ribosome entry site.

The genome encodes a single polyprotein with multiple transmembrane domains that is cleaved, by both host and viral proteases, into structural and non-structural proteins. Among the non-structural protein products (NS), the locations and sequences of NS3 and NS5, which contain motifs essential for polyprotein processing and RNA replication respectively, are relatively well conserved across the family and may be useful for phylogenetic analysis.

== Life cycle ==

Viral replication is cytoplasmic. Entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment of the viral envelope protein E to host receptors, which mediates clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Replication follows the positive-stranded RNA virus replication model. Positive-stranded RNA virus transcription is the method of transcription. Translation takes place by viral initiation. The virion assembles by budding through intracellular membranes and exits the host cell by exocytosis.

==Host range and evolutionary history==
A wide variety of natural hosts are used by different members of the &quot;Flaviviridae&quot;, including fish, mammals including humans and various invertebrates, such as those specific to mollusks and crustaceans. The genomes of these flaviviruses show close synteny with that of the flavivirus type species, yellow fever virus. One flavivirus, the Wenzhou shark flavivirus, infects both Pacific spadenose sharks (&quot;Scoliodon macrorhynchos&quot;) and Gazami crabs (&quot;Portunus trituberculatus&quot;) with overlapping ranges, raising the possibility of a two-host marine lifecycle. However, another clade of flavivirus, the insect-specific flaviviruses, have genomes that do not demonstrate strong synteny with any of these groups, suggesting a complex evolutionary history.

Flavivirus endogenous viral elements, traces of flavivirus genomes integrated into the host&#x27;s DNA, are found in many species, including a tadpole shrimp &quot;Lepidurus articus&quot;, the water flea &quot;Daphnia magna&quot; and a freshwater jellyfish &quot;Craspedacusta sowerbii&quot;, suggesting ancient coevolution between animal and flavivirus lineages. Many of the well-known members of the family causing disease in vertebrates are transmitted via arthropod vectors (ticks and mosquitoes).

== Taxonomy ==
The &quot;Flaviviridae&quot; are part of RNA virus supergroup II, which includes certain plant viruses and bacterial viruses.

The family has four genera:
*Genus &quot;Flavivirus,&quot; renamed &quot;Orthoflavivirus&quot; in 2023, (includes &quot;Dengue virus&quot;, &quot;Japanese encephalitis&quot;, &quot;Kyasanur Forest disease&quot;, &quot;Powassan virus&quot;, &quot;West Nile virus&quot;, &quot;Yellow fever virus&quot;, and &quot;Zika virus&quot;)
*Genus &quot;Hepacivirus&quot; (includes &quot;Hepacivirus C&quot; (hepatitis C virus) and &quot;Hepacivirus B&quot; (GB virus B))
*Genus &quot;Pegivirus&quot; (includes &quot;Pegivirus A&quot; (GB virus A), &quot;Pegivirus C&quot; (GB virus C), and &quot;Pegivirus B&quot; (GB virus D))
*Genus &quot;Pestivirus&quot; (includes &quot;Pestivirus A&quot; (bovine viral diarrhea virus 1) and &quot;Pestivirus C&quot; (classical swine fever virus, previously hog cholera virus)). Viruses in this genus infect nonhuman mammals.

;Unclassified

Other Orthoflaviviruses are known that have yet to be classified. These include Wenling shark virus.

Jingmenvirus is a group of unclassified viruses in the family which includes Alongshan virus, Guaico Culex virus, Jingmen tick virus and Mogiana tick virus. These viruses have a segmented genome of four or five pieces. Two of these segments are derived from flaviviruses.

A number of viruses may be related to the flaviviruses, but have features that are atypical of the flaviviruses. These include citrus Jingmen-like virus, soybean cyst nematode virus 5, Toxocara canis larva agent, Wuhan cricket virus, and possibly Gentian Kobu-sho-associated virus.

==Clinical importance==
Major diseases caused by members of the family &quot;Flaviviridae&quot; include:

<text>The Right Livelihood Award is an international award to &quot;honour and support those offering practical and exemplary answers to the most urgent challenges facing us today.&quot; The prize was established in 1980 by German-Swedish philanthropist Jakob von Uexküll, and is presented annually in early December. An international jury, invited by the five regular Right Livelihood Award board members, decides the awards in such fields as environmental protection, human rights, sustainable development, health, education, and peace. The prize money is shared among the winners, usually numbering four, and is €200,000. Very often one of the four laureates receives an honorary award, which means that the other three share the prize money.

Although it has been promoted as an &quot;Alternative Nobel Prize&quot;, it does not have any organizational ties at all to the awarding institutions of the Nobel Prize or the Nobel Foundation.

The Right Livelihood Award committee arranged for awards to be made in the Riksdag of Sweden the day before the Nobel prizes and the economics prize are awarded in Stockholm. The Right Livelihood Awards are generally understood as a critique of the traditional Nobel prizes. 

The establishment of this award followed a failed attempt to have the Nobel Foundation create new prizes in the areas of environmental protection, sustainable development and human rights. The prize has been awarded to a diverse group of people and organisations, including Wangari Maathai, Astrid Lindgren, Bianca Jagger, Mordechai Vanunu, Leopold Kohr, Arna Mer-Khamis, Felicia Langer, Petra Kelly, Survival International, Amy Goodman, Catherine Hamlin, Memorial, Edward Snowden, Daniel Ellsberg, and Greta Thunberg.

==Ceremony==
Since 1985, the ceremony has taken place in Stockholm&#x27;s old Parliament building, in the days before the traditional Nobel prizes are awarded in the same city. A group of Swedish Parliamentarians from different parties host the ceremony; in 2009 European Commissioner Margot Wallström co-hosted the ceremony. However, in 2014 when it became public that one of the recipients of the 2014 prize was whistleblower Edward Snowden, the ceremonial group was disinvited from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs building in Stockholm.

In 2019, marking the 40th anniversary of the foundation of the Award, the ceremony was held at Cirkus in front of a live audience of more than 1,200 people. World-renowned artists such as José González and Ane Brun were among the night&#x27;s performers.

==Nature of the award==
Some media refer to the prize as the &quot;Alternative Nobel Prize&quot;, and the prize is frequently understood as a critique of the traditional Nobel prizes. The prize differs significantly from the Nobel Prizes:
*It is not a fulfillment of Alfred Nobel&#x27;s bequest and thus not one of Nobel&#x27;s own prizes.
*It has an open nomination process (anyone can nominate anyone else, except close relatives or their own organizations).
*It is not limited to specific categories.
*The prize money is considerably lower than that of the Nobel Prize. Currently it is €200,000 compared to about €1,000,000 for a Nobel Prize.
*The funds for the prizes now come from donations. while the Nobel Prizes come from the revenue of Alfred Nobel&#x27;s fortune. The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (which is technically not a Nobel Prize) is financed by the Sveriges Riksbank.

==History==
Jakob von Uexküll, a philanthropist, sold his stamp collection worth US$1 million, which provided the initial funding for the award. Before establishing the award in 1980, von Uexkull had tried to persuade the Nobel Foundation to establish new prizes to be awarded together with the Nobel Prizes. He suggested new prize categories to be created: one in ecology and one in development. Like the Nobel Economics Prize, this would have been possible with an amendment to the Nobel Foundation statutes and funding of the prize amount completely separate from Nobel&#x27;s fortune. The Nobel Prize amount was 880,000 Swedish kronor at that time, which corresponded to US$195,000. However, as a result of the debate that followed the establishment of the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel (first awarded in 1969), the Nobel Foundation had decided not to associate the Nobel Prize with any additional awards, so von Uexküll&#x27;s proposal was rejected.

From 1980 to 2021, the foundation presented awards to 186 laureates from 73 countries. Its self-described purpose is to bestow prizes and thus publicize the work of recipients&#x27; local solutions to worldwide problems.

<text>The Cascade Range or Cascades is a major mountain range of western North America, extending from southern British Columbia through Washington and Oregon to Northern California. It includes both non-volcanic mountains, such as many of those in the North Cascades, and the notable volcanoes known as the High Cascades. The small part of the range in British Columbia is referred to as the Canadian Cascades or, locally, as the Cascade Mountains. The highest peak in the range is Mount Rainier in Washington at .

 part of the Pacific Ocean&#x27;s Ring of Fire, the ring of volcanoes and associated mountains around the Pacific Ocean. All of the eruptions in the contiguous United States over the last 200 years have been from the Cascade Volcanoes. The two most recent were Lassen Peak from 1914 to 1921 and a major eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980. Minor eruptions of Mount St. Helens have also occurred since, most recently from 2004 to 2008. The Cascade Range is a part of the American Cordillera, a nearly continuous chain of mountain ranges (cordillera) that form the western &quot;backbone&quot; of North, Central, and South America.

The Cascades are home to many national parks and protected areas, including North Cascades National Park, Mount Rainier National Park, Crater Lake National Park, and Lassen Volcanic National Park. The northern half of the Pacific Crest Trail follows the range.

== Geography ==

The Cascades extend northward from Lassen Peak (also known as Mount Lassen) in northern California to the confluence of the Nicola and Thompson rivers in British Columbia. The Fraser River separates the Cascades from the Coast Mountains in Canada, as does the Willamette Valley from the upper portion of the Oregon Coast Range. The highest volcanoes of the Cascades, known as the High Cascades, dominate their surroundings, often standing twice the height of the nearby mountains. They often have a visual height (height above nearby crestlines) of one mile or more. The highest peaks, such as the Mount Rainier, dominate their surroundings for .

The northern part of the range, north of Mount Rainier, is known as the North Cascades in the United States but is formally named the Cascade Mountains north of the Canada–United States border, reaching to the northern extremity of the Cascades at Lytton Mountain. Overall, the North Cascades and Canadian Cascades are extremely rugged; even the lesser peaks are steep and glaciated, and valleys are quite low relative to peaks and ridges, so there is great local relief. The southern part of the Canadian Cascades, particularly the Skagit Range, is geologically and topographically similar to the North Cascades, while the northern and northeastern parts are less glaciated and more plateau-like, resembling nearby areas of the Thompson Plateau.

The range is near the Pacific Ocean and in the region&#x27;s prevailing westerly winds, so it receives significant rain and snowfall, especially on the western slopes due to orographic lift, with annual snow accumulations of up to (= ) in some areas. Mount Baker in Washington recorded a national record single-season snowfall in the winter of 1998–99 with (= ). Before that year, Mount Rainier held the American record for snow accumulation at Paradise in 1978. It is not uncommon for some places in the Cascades to have over of annual snow accumulation, such as at Lake Helen, near Lassen Peak. Most of the High Cascades are therefore white with snow and ice year-round. The western slopes are densely covered with Douglas-fir (&quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot;), western hemlock (&quot;Tsuga heterophylla&quot;) and red alder (&quot;Alnus rubra&quot;), while the drier eastern slopes feature mostly ponderosa pine (&quot;Pinus ponderosa&quot;), with some western larch (&quot;Larix occidentalis&quot;), mountain hemlock (&quot;Tsuga mertensiana&quot;) and subalpine fir (&quot;Abies lasiocarpa&quot;) and subalpine larch (&quot;Larix lyallii&quot;) at higher elevations. Annual rainfall is as low as on the eastern foothills due to a rain shadow effect.

Beyond the eastern foothills is an arid plateau that was largely formed 17 to 14 million years ago by the many flows of the Columbia River Basalt Group. Together, these sequences of fluid volcanic rock form the Columbia Plateau in eastern Washington, Oregon, and parts of western Idaho.

The Columbia River Gorge is the only major break of the range in the United States. When the Cascades began to rise 7 million years ago in the late Miocene, the Columbia River drained the relatively low Columbia Plateau. As the range grew, erosion from the Columbia River was able to keep pace, carving out the gorge and major pass seen today. The gorge also exposes uplifted and warped layers of basalt from the plateau.

== History ==
Before European exploration, First Nations tribes named many peaks, including &quot;Seekseekqua&quot; for Mount Jefferson (Oregon), &quot;M&#x27;laiksini Yaina&quot; for Mount McLoughlin, &quot;Tahoma&quot;, the Lushootseed name for Mount Rainier, and &quot;Louwala-Clough&quot;, meaning &quot;smoking mountain&quot; for Mount St. Helens.

In early 1792, British navigator George Vancouver explored Puget Sound and gave English names to the high mountains he saw. Mount Baker was named for Vancouver&#x27;s third lieutenant, Joseph Baker, although the first European to see it was Manuel Quimper, who named it &quot;la gran montaña del Carmelo&quot; (&quot;Great Mount Carmel&quot;) in 1790. Mount Rainier was named after Admiral Peter Rainier. Later in 1792, Vancouver had his lieutenant William Robert Broughton explore the lower Columbia River. He named Mount Hood after Lord Samuel Hood, an admiral of the Royal Navy. Mount St. Helens was sighted by Vancouver in May 1792, from near the mouth of the Columbia River. It was named for Alleyne FitzHerbert, 1st Baron St Helens, a British diplomat. Vancouver&#x27;s expedition did not, however, name the mountain range which contained these peaks. He referred to it simply as the &quot;eastern snowy range&quot;. Earlier Spanish explorers called it &quot;Sierra Nevada&quot;, meaning &quot;snowy mountains&quot;.

In 1805, the Lewis and Clark Expedition passed through the Cascades on the Columbia River, which for many years was the only practical way to pass that part of the range. They were the first non-indigenous people to see Mount Adams, but they thought it was Mount St. Helens. When they later saw Mount St. Helens they thought it was Mount Rainier. On their return trip, Lewis and Clark spotted a high but distant snowy pinnacle that they named for the sponsor of the expedition, U.S. President Thomas Jefferson. Lewis and Clark called the Cascade Range the &quot;Western Mountains&quot;.

The Lewis and Clark expedition, and the many settlers and traders that followed, met their last obstacle to their journey at the Cascades Rapids in the Columbia River Gorge, a feature on the river now submerged beneath the Bonneville Reservoir. Before long, the great white-capped mountains that loomed above the rapids were called the &quot;mountains by the cascades&quot; and later simply as the &quot;Cascades&quot;. The earliest attested use of the name &quot;Cascade Range&quot; is in the writings of botanist David Douglas in 1825.

In 1814, Alexander Ross, a fur trader with the North West Company, seeking a viable route across the mountains, explored and crossed the northern Cascades between Fort Okanogan and Puget Sound. His report of the journey is vague about the route taken. He followed the lower Methow River into the mountains. He might have used Cascade Pass to reach the Skagit River. Ross was the first European-American to explore the Methow River area and likely the first to explore the Stehekin River and Bridge Creek region. Due to the difficulty of crossing the northern Cascades and the paucity of beaver, fur-trading companies made only a few explorations into the mountains north of the Columbia River after Ross.

Exploration and settlement of the Cascades region by Europeans and Americans was accelerated by the establishment of a major trading post of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) at Fort Vancouver near today&#x27;s Portland, Oregon. From this base HBC trapping parties traveled throughout the Cascades in search of beaver and other fur-bearing animals. For example, using what became known as the Siskiyou Trail, Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company trappers were the first non-natives to explore the southern Cascades in the 1820s and 1830s, establishing trails which passed near Crater Lake, Mount McLoughlin, Medicine Lake Volcano, Mount Shasta, and Lassen Peak.

The course of political history in the Pacific Northwest saw the spine of the Cascade Range being proposed as a boundary settlement during the Oregon Dispute of 1846. The United States rejected the proposal and insisted on the 49th parallel north, which cuts across the range just north of Mount Baker. Throughout the period of dispute and up to the creation of the Crown Colony of British Columbia in 1858, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s York Factory Express route, as well the route of fur brigades, followed the Okanogan River along the east edge of the Cascades and the Columbia River through the range. Passes across the range were not well known and little used. Naches Pass was used for driving cattle and horses to Fort Nisqually. Yakima Pass was also used by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company.

American settlement of the flanks of the Coast Range did not occur until the early 1840s, at first only marginally. Following the Oregon Treaty the inward flux of migration from the Oregon Trail intensified and the passes and back-valleys of what is now the state of Washington were explored and populated, and it was not long after that railways followed. Despite its being traversed by several major freeways and rail lines, and its lower flanks subjected to major logging in recent decades, large parts of the range remain intense and forbidding alpine wilderness. Much of the northern half of the Cascades, from Rainier north, have been preserved by U.S. national or British Columbia provincial parks (such as E.C. Manning Provincial Park), or other forms of protected area.

The Canadian side of the range has a history that includes the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush of 1858–60 and its famous Cariboo Road, as well as the older Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company Brigade Trail from the Canyon to the Interior, the Dewdney Trail, and older routes which connected east to the Similkameen and Okanagan valleys.

The southern mainline of the Canadian Pacific Railway penetrated the range via the passes of the Coquihalla River, along one of the steepest and snowiest routes in the entire Pacific Cordillera. Near Hope, B.C., the railway roadbed and the Othello Tunnels, now decommissioned, are popular tourist recreation destinations for hiking and bicycling. The pass is used by the Coquihalla Highway, a government megaproject built as part of the Expo 86 spending boom of the 1980s, which is now the main route from the Coast to the British Columbia interior. Traffic formerly went via the Fraser Canyon, to the west, or via Allison Pass and Manning Park along Highway 3 to the south, near the border.

The Barlow Road was the first established land path for U.S. settlers through the Cascade Range in 1845, and formed the final overland link for the Oregon Trail (previously, settlers had to raft down the treacherous rapids of the Columbia River). The Road left the Columbia at what is now Hood River and passed along the south side of Mount Hood at what is now Government Camp, terminating in Oregon City. There is an interpretive site there now at &quot;The End of The Oregon Trail&quot;. The road was constructed as a toll road – $5 per wagon – and was very successful.

In addition, the Applegate Trail was created to allow settlers to avoid rafting down the Columbia River. The Trail used the path of the California Trail to north-central Nevada. From there, the Trail headed northwest into northern California, and continued northwest towards today&#x27;s Ashland, Oregon. From there, settlers would head north along the established Siskiyou Trail into the Willamette Valley.

With the exception of the 1915 eruption of remote Lassen Peak in Northern California, the range was quiet for more than a century. Then, on May 18, 1980, the dramatic eruption of Mount St. Helens shattered the quiet and brought the world&#x27;s attention to the range. Geologists were also concerned that the St. Helens eruption was a sign that long-dormant Cascade volcanoes might become active once more, as in the period from 1800 to 1857 when a total of eight erupted. None have erupted since St. Helens, but precautions are being taken nevertheless, such as the Cascades Volcano Observatory and Mount Rainier Volcano Lahar Warning System in Pierce County, Washington.

==Geology==

The Cascade Range is made up of a band of thousands of very small, short-lived volcanoes that have built a platform of lava and volcanic debris. Rising above this volcanic platform are a few strikingly large volcanoes, like Mount Hood and Mount St. Helens, that dominate the landscape.

The Cascade volcanoes define the Pacific Northwest section of the Ring of Fire, an array of volcanoes that rim the Pacific Ocean. The Ring of Fire is also known for its frequent earthquakes. The volcanoes and earthquakes arise from a common source: subduction, where the dense Juan de Fuca Plate plunges beneath the North American Plate. As the oceanic slab sinks deep into the Earth&#x27;s interior beneath the continental plate, high temperatures and pressures allow water molecules locked in the minerals of solid rock to escape. The water vapor rises into the pliable mantle above the subducting plate, causing some of the mantle to melt. This newly formed magma rises toward the Earth&#x27;s surface to erupt, forming a chain of volcanoes (the Cascade Volcanic Arc) above the subduction zone.

==Human uses==
Soil conditions for farming are generally good, especially downwind of volcanoes. This is largely because volcanic rocks are often rich in potassium-bearing minerals such as orthoclase, and erode relatively easily. Volcanic debris, especially lahars, also helps to spread mineral-rich volcanic material, and the storage of water in the form of snow and ice is also important for agriculture. The snow-capped mountains, such as Mt. Hood and Mt. Bachelor, are used as ski resorts in the late winter, while in the summer they become popular hiking and mountaineering locations. Much of their meltwater eventually flows into reservoirs, where it is used for recreation, while its potential energy is captured to generate hydroelectric power before the water is used to irrigate crops.

Because of the abundance of powerful streams, many of the major westward-draining rivers of the Cascades have been dammed to provide hydroelectric power. One of these, Ross Dam on the Skagit River, retains a reservoir which spans the border southeast of Hope, British Columbia, extending into Canada. At the foot of the southeast flank of Mount Baker, at Concrete, Washington, the Baker River is dammed to form Lake Shannon and Baker Lake.

The Cascades harbor a largely-untapped potential for geothermal power. The U.S. Geological Survey Geothermal Research Program has been investigating this potential. Some of this energy is already being used in places like Klamath Falls, Oregon, where volcanic steam is used to heat public buildings. The highest recorded underground temperature found in the range is at below Newberry Volcano&#x27;s caldera floor.

==Ecology==

Forests of large, coniferous trees (western red cedars, Douglas-firs, western hemlocks, firs, pines, spruces, and others) dominate most of the Cascade Range. Cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers (largely a result of oceanic influence) favor evergreen species, whereas mild temperatures and rich soils promote fast and prolonged growth.
As a traveler passes through the Cascade Range, the climate first gets colder, then warmer and drier east of the crest. Most of the Cascades&#x27; lower and middle elevations are covered in coniferous forest; the higher altitudes have extensive meadows as well as alpine tundra and glaciers. The southern part of the Cascades are within the California Floristic Province, an area of high biodiversity.

Silver fir predominates above 2500 ft, while there are moors, meadows, and mountain hemlock/subalpine fir groves from 4500 to 6000 ft on the west side. The treeline is at ~6000 feet. On the east side, subalpine forests of larch trees grade to pine and interior fir forests below 4200 ft, which grade to ponderosa below 2500 ft, which in turn grades to semidesert scrub near sea level. Above 7500 ft, the landscape is barren with either no plants or only moss and lichen.

Black bears, coyotes, bobcats, cougars, beavers, deer, elk, moose, mountain goats and a few wolf packs returning from Canada live in the Cascades. Fewer than 50 grizzly bears reside in the Cascades of Canada and Washington.

<text>Arnulf is a masculine German given name.
It is composed of the Germanic elements &quot;arn&quot; &quot;eagle&quot; and &quot;ulf&quot; &quot;wolf&quot;.
The &quot;-ulf, -olf&quot; suffix was an extremely frequent element in Germanic onomastics and from an early time was perceived as a mere suffix forming given names. Similarly, the suffix &quot;-wald, -ald, -old&quot;, originally from &quot;wald&quot; &quot;rule, power&quot; underwent semantic weakening. 
Therefore, the name &quot;Arnulf&quot; and &quot;Arnold&quot; were often conflated in early medieval records, as is the case with bishop Arnulf of Metz (died 640), especially as the final consonant came to be dropped (&quot;Arnoul&quot;).

The name &quot;Arnulf&quot; is attested from as early as the 5th century, as the name of the brother of Odoacer. The name is attested with some frequency in Medieval Germany throughout the 8th to 11th centuries, in the spelling variants &quot;Arnulf, Arnulph, Arnolf&quot;, occasionally also as &quot;Arenulph, Harnulf, Harnolf, Harnolph&quot;.
In the 9th century, Arnulf of Carinthia was the ruler of East Francia and was crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 896.

There was an Anglo-Saxon cognate, &quot;Earnulf&quot; (Ernulf), which was assimilated to the Frankish form of the name after the Norman conquest. Arnulf of Eynesbury is an obscure 9th-century English saint, who was mostly forgotten by the 11th century, and who was perhaps just a folkloristic duplicate of the historical Arnulf of Metz. In any case, the English Arnulf would have been known as &quot;Earnulf&quot;, and his relics were venerated in &quot;Earnulfesbyrig&quot; (Eynesbury, Cambridgeshire).
The name is also attested in medieval Scandinavia, as Old Norse &quot;Arnúlfr&quot; (&quot;Ærnulfr, Ǫrnólfr, Ǫrnulfr&quot;, Old Swedish &quot;Ærinolf, Ærnolf, Ärnulf&quot;). Scandinavian dialectal and regional variants of the name include &quot;Annul, Annulv, Anul, Arnolv, Arnulv, Örnólfur, Ørnolvur, Örnulf, Ørnulf, Ørnulv&quot;.

The given name Arnulf remains in use in Germany and in Norway, and to a lesser extent in Sweden.

<text>Ginés Pérez de Hita (1544? – 1619?) was a Spanish novelist and poet, born at Mula (Murcia) about the middle of the 16th century.

It is likely that he joined the campaign against the &quot;Moriscos&quot; in the Alpujarra in 1560.

==&quot;Guerras civiles de Granada&quot;==
Pérez de Hita owes his wide celebrity to the &quot;Historia de los bandos de los Zegríes y Abencerrajes&quot; (1595–1619), better known as the &quot;Guerras civiles de Granada&quot; (&quot;Wars of Granada&quot;), which purports to be a chronicle based on an Arabic original ascribed to a certain Aben-Hamin.
Abed-Hamin is a fictitious character, and the &quot;Wars of Granada&quot; is, in reality, a historical novel, perhaps the earliest example of its kind, and certainly the first historical novel that attained popularity.

In the first part, the events which led to the downfall of Granada are related with uncommon brilliancy, and Pérez de Hita&#x27;s sympathetic transcription of life at the Emir&#x27;s court has clearly suggested the conventional presentation of the picturesque, chivalrous Moor in the pages of Mlle de Scudéry, Mme de Lafayette, Châteaubriand and Washington Irving.

The second part is concerned with the author&#x27;s personal experiences and the treatment is effective; yet, though Calderón&#x27;s play, &quot;Amar después de la muerte&quot;, is derived from it, this less picturesque second part has never enjoyed the vogue or influence of the first. The exact date of Pérez de Hita&#x27;s death is unknown. His blank verse rendering of the &quot;Crónica Troyana&quot;, written in 1596, exists in manuscript.

<doc id="76234" wikidata="Q35876" url="?curid=76234" title="Guarani language">
<text>Paraguayan Guarani is a South American language that belongs to the Tupi–Guarani branch of the Tupian language family. It is one of the official languages of Paraguay (along with Spanish), where it is spoken by the majority of the population, and where half of the rural population are monolingual speakers of the language.

Variants of the language are spoken by communities in neighboring countries including parts of northeastern Argentina, southeastern Bolivia and southwestern Brazil. It is a second official language of the Argentine province of Corrientes since 2004., and in the Brazilian city of Tacuru since 2010. Guarani is also one of the three official languages of Mercosur, alongside Spanish and Portuguese.

Guarani is one of the most widely spoken Native American languages and remains commonly used among the Paraguayan people and neighboring communities. This is unique among American languages; language shift towards European colonial languages (in this case, the other official language of Spanish) has otherwise been a nearly universal phenomenon in the Western Hemisphere, but Paraguayans have maintained their traditional language while also adopting Spanish.

Jesuit priest Antonio Ruiz de Montoya, who in 1639 published the first written grammar of Guarani in a book called (Treasure/Thesaurus of the Guarani Language), described it as a language &quot;so copious and elegant that it can compete with the most famous [of languages]&quot;.

The name &quot;Guarani&quot; is generally used for the official language of Paraguay. However, this is part of a dialect chain, most of whose components are also often called Guarani.

== History ==
While Guarani, in its Classical form, was the only language spoken in the expansive missionary territories, Paraguayan Guarani has its roots outside of the Jesuit Reductions.

Modern scholarship has shown that Guarani was always the primary language of colonial Paraguay, both inside and outside the reductions. Following the expulsion of the Jesuits in the 18th century, the residents of the reductions gradually migrated north and west towards Asunción, a demographic shift that brought about a decidedly one-sided shift away from the Jesuit dialect that the missionaries had curated in the southern and eastern territories of the colony.

By and large, the Guarani of the Jesuits shied away from direct phonological loans from Spanish. Instead, the missionaries relied on the agglutinative nature of the language to formulate new precise translations or calque terms from Guarani morphemes. This process often led the Jesuits to employ complicated, highly synthetic terms to convey European concepts. By contrast, the Guarani spoken outside of the missions was characterized by a free, unregulated flow of Hispanicisms; frequently, Spanish words and phrases were simply incorporated into Guarani with minimal phonological adaptation.

A good example of that phenomenon is found in the word &quot;communion&quot;. The Jesuits, using their agglutinative strategy, rendered this word &quot;, a calque based on the word &quot;, meaning God. In modern Paraguayan Guarani, the same word is rendered &quot;&quot;.

Following the out-migration from the reductions, these two distinct dialects of Guarani came into extensive contact for the first time. The vast majority of speakers abandoned the less colloquial, highly regulated Jesuit variant in favor of the variety that evolved from actual use by speakers in Paraguay. This contemporary form of spoken Guarani is known as Jopará, meaning &quot;mixture&quot; in Guarani.

=== Political status ===
Widely spoken, Paraguayan Guarani has nevertheless been repressed by Paraguayan governments throughout most of its history since independence. It was prohibited in state schools for over 100 years. However, populists often used pride in the language to excite nationalistic fervor and promote a narrative of social unity.

During the autocratic regime of Alfredo Stroessner, his Colorado Party used the language to appeal to common Paraguayans although Stroessner himself never gave an address in Guarani. Upon the advent of Paraguayan democracy in 1992, Guarani was established in the new constitution as a language equal to Spanish.

Jopará, the mixture of Spanish and Guarani, is spoken by an estimated 90% of the population of Paraguay. Code-switching between the two languages takes place on a spectrum in which more Spanish is used for official and business-related matters, and more Guarani is used in art and in everyday life.

Guarani is also an official language of Bolivia and of Corrientes Province in Argentina.

== Writing system ==
Guarani became a written language relatively recently. Its modern alphabet is a subset of the Latin script (with &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; but not &quot;W&quot;), complemented with two diacritics and six digraphs. Its orthography is largely phonemic, with letter values mostly similar to those of Spanish. The tilde is used with many letters that are considered part of the alphabet. In the case of , it differentiates the palatal nasal from the alveolar nasal (as in Spanish), whereas it marks stressed nasalisation when used over a vowel (as in Portuguese): . (Nasal vowels have been written with several other diacritics: .) The tilde also marks nasality in the case of , used to represent the nasalized velar approximant by combining the velar approximant with the nasalising tilde. The letter , which is unique to this language, was introduced into the orthography relatively recently during the mid-20th century and there is disagreement over its use. It is not a precomposed character in Unicode, which can cause typographic inconveniences – such as needing to press &quot;delete&quot; twice in some setups – or imperfect rendering when using computers and fonts that do not properly support the complex layout feature of glyph composition.

Only stressed nasal vowels are written as nasal. If an oral vowel is stressed, and it is not the final syllable, it is marked with an acute accent: . That is, stress falls on the vowel marked as nasalized, if any, else on the accent-marked syllable, and if neither appears, then on the final syllable.

Guarani Braille is the braille alphabet used for the blind.

== Phonology ==
Guarani syllables consist of a consonant plus a vowel or a vowel alone; syllables ending in a consonant or two or more consonants together do not occur. This is represented as &quot;(C)V&quot;.

In the below table, the IPA value is shown. The orthography is shown in angle brackets below, if different.

=== Consonants ===
The voiced consonants have oral allophones (left) before oral vowels, and nasal allophones (right) before nasal vowels. The oral allophones of the voiced stops are prenasalized.

There is also a sequence (written ). A trill (written ), and the consonants , , and (written ) are not native to Guarani, but come from Spanish.

Oral is often pronounced , , , , depending on the dialect, but the nasal allophone is always .

The dorsal fricative is in free variation between and .

, are approximants, not fricatives, but are sometimes transcribed , , as is conventional for Spanish. is also transcribed , which is essentially identical to .

All syllables are open, viz. CV or V, ending in a vowel.

=== Glottal stop ===
The glottal stop, called in Guarani, is only written between vowels, but occurs phonetically before vowel-initial words. Because of this, some words have several glottal stops near each other that consequently undergo a number of different dissimilation techniques. For example, &quot;I drink water&quot; is pronounced . This suggests that irregularity in verb forms derives from regular sound change processes in the history of Guarani. There also seems to be some degree of variation between how much the glottal stop is dropped (for example for &quot;I bring&quot;). It is possible that word-internal glottal stops may have been retained from fossilized compounds where the second component was a vowel-initial (and therefore glottal stop–initial) root.

=== Vowels ===
 correspond more or less to the Spanish and IPA equivalents, although sometimes the open-mid allophones , are used more frequently. The grapheme represents the vowel (as in Polish). Considering nasality, the vowel system is perfectly symmetrical, each oral vowel having its nasal counterpart (most systems with nasals have fewer nasals than orals).

==== Nasal harmony ====
Guarani displays an unusual degree of nasal harmony. A nasal syllable consists of a nasal vowel, and if the consonant is voiced, it takes its nasal allophone. If a stressed syllable is nasal, the nasality spreads in &quot;both&quot; directions until it bumps up against a stressed syllable that is oral. This includes affixes, postpositions, and compounding. Voiceless consonants do not have nasal allophones, but they do not interrupt the spread of nasality.

For example,
: → 

However, a second stressed syllable, with an oral vowel, will not become nasalized:
: → 

That is, for a word with a single stressed vowel, all voiced segments will be either oral or nasal, while voiceless consonants are unaffected, as in oral vs nasal .

== Grammar ==
Guarani is a highly agglutinative language, often classified as polysynthetic. It is a fluid-S type active language, and it has been classified as a 6th class language in Milewski&#x27;s typology. It uses subject–verb–object (SVO) word order usually, but object–verb when the subject is not specified.

The language lacks gender and has no native definite article but, due to influence from Spanish, is used as a definite article for singular reference and for plural reference. These are not found in Classical Guarani (&quot;Guaraniete&quot;).

=== Nouns ===
Guarani exhibits nominal tense: past, expressed with , and future, expressed with . For example, translates to &quot;ex-president&quot; while translates to &quot;president-elect.&quot; The past morpheme is often translated as &quot;ex-&quot;, &quot;former&quot;, &quot;abandoned&quot;, &quot;what was once&quot;, or &quot;one-time&quot;. These morphemes can even be combined to express the idea of something that was going to be but did not end up happening. So for example, is &quot;a person who studied to be a priest but didn&#x27;t actually finish&quot;, or rather, &quot;the ex-future priest&quot;. Some nouns use instead of and others use instead of .

=== Pronouns ===
Guarani distinguishes between inclusive and exclusive pronouns of the first person plural.

Reflexive pronoun: : (&quot;I look&quot;), (&quot;I look at myself&quot;)

=== Conjugation ===
Guarani stems can be divided into a number of conjugation classes, which are called (with the subclass ) and . The names for these classes stem from the names of the prefixes for 1st and 2nd person singular.

The conjugation is used to convey that the participant is actively involved, whereas the conjugation is used to convey that the participant is the undergoer. However, the conjugation is also used if an intransitive verb expresses an event as opposed to a state, for example &#x27;die&#x27;, and even with a verb such as &#x27;sleep&#x27;. In addition, all borrowed Spanish verbs are adopted as as opposed to borrowed adjectives, which take . Intransitive verbs can take either conjugation, transitive verbs normally take , but can take for habitual readings. Nouns can also be conjugated, but only as . This conveys a predicative possessive reading.

Furthermore, the conjugations vary slightly according to the stem being oral or nasal.

==== Negation ====
Negation is indicated by a circumfix in Guarani. The preverbal portion of the circumfix is for oral bases and for nasal bases. For 2nd person singular, an epenthetic is inserted before the base, for 1st person plural inclusive, an epenthetic is inserted.

The postverbal portion is for bases ending in , and for all others. However, in spoken Guarani, the portion of the circumfix is frequently omitted for bases ending in .

The negation can be used in all tenses, but for future or irrealis reference, the normal tense marking is replaced by , resulting in -base- as in , &quot;I won&#x27;t do it&quot;.

There are also other negatives, such as: , , , , .

=== Tense and aspect morphemes ===
* : marks extreme proximity of the action, often translating to &quot;just barely&quot;: , &quot;He just barely arrived&quot;.
* : marks proximity of the action. , &quot;I just ate&quot; ( irregular first person singular form of , &quot;to eat&quot;). It can also be used after a pronoun, as in , &quot;and about what happened to me, I was lucky&quot;.
* : indicates a fact that occurred long ago and asserts that it&#x27;s really truth. , &quot;he/she went missing a long time ago&quot;.
* : tells that the speaker was doubtful before but he&#x27;s sure at the moment he speaks. , &quot;so then you bought a new television after all&quot;.
* : expresses the uncertainty of a perfect-aspect fact. , &quot;I think you lived in Asunción for a while&quot;. Nevertheless, nowadays this morpheme has lost some of its meaning, having a correspondence with and .
The verb form without suffixes at all is a present somewhat aorist: , &quot;that day you got out and you went far&quot;.
* : is a future of immediate happening, it&#x27;s also used as authoritarian imperative. , &quot;he/she&#x27;ll come back soon&quot;.
* : has the meaning of &quot;already&quot;. , &quot;I already did it&quot;.
These two suffixes can be added together: , &quot;I&#x27;m already going&quot;.
* : indicates something not imminent or something that must be done for social or moral reasons, in this case corresponding to the German modal verb . , &quot;that must be done&quot;.
* : indicates something that probably will happen or something the speaker imagines that is happening. It correlates in a certain way with the subjunctive of Spanish. , &quot;the children are probably coming home now&quot;.
* &#x27;, &#x27; after nasal words: continual action at the moment of speaking, present and pluperfect continuous or emphatic. , &quot;we&#x27;re making fire&quot;; , &quot;it&#x27;s ME!&quot;.
* : it has a subtle difference with in which indicates not necessarily what&#x27;s being done at the moment of speaking. , &quot;I&#x27;m working (not necessarily now)&quot;.
* : indicates proximity immediately before the start of the process. , &quot;I&#x27;m near the point at which I will start to kill&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;m just about to kill&quot;. (A particular sandhi rule is applied here: if the verbs ends in , the suffix changes to ; , &quot;I&#x27;ll do it right now&quot;).
* : indicates emphatically that a process has all finished. , &quot;I painted the wall completely&quot;.
This suffix can be joined with , making up : , &quot;now we came to know all your thought&quot;.
* : customary action in the past: , &quot;He used to come a lot&quot;.
These are unstressed suffixes: ; so the stress goes upon the last syllable of the verb or the last stressed syllable.

=== Other verbal morphemes ===
* : desiderative suffix: , &quot;I want to study&quot;.
* : desiderative prefix: , &quot;I pass&quot;, , &quot;I would like to pass.&quot; is the underlying form. It is similar to the negative in that it has the same vowel alternations and deletions, depending on the person marker on the verb.

== Determiners ==
== Spanish loans in Guarani ==
The close and prolonged contact Spanish and Guarani have experienced has resulted in many Guarani words of Spanish origin. Many of these loans were for things or concepts unknown to the New World prior to Spanish colonization. Examples are seen below:

== Guarani loans in English ==
English has adopted a small number of words from Guarani (or perhaps the related Tupi) via Portuguese, mostly the names of animals or plants. &quot;Jaguar&quot; comes from and &quot;piraña&quot; comes from (&quot;tooth fish&quot; Tupi: &#x27;fish&#x27;, &#x27;tooth&#x27;). Other words are: &quot;agouti&quot; from , &quot;tapir&quot; from , &quot;coati&quot; from &quot;kuatĩ&quot;, &quot;açaí&quot; from (&quot;[fruit that] cries or expels water&quot;), &quot;warrah&quot; from meaning &quot;fox&quot;, and &quot;margay&quot; from meaning &quot;small cat&quot;. Jacaranda, guarana and manioc are words of Guarani or Tupi–Guarani origin. Ipecacuanha (the name of a medicinal drug) comes from a homonymous Tupi–Guarani name that can be rendered as , meaning a creeping plant that makes one vomit. &quot;Cougar&quot; is borrowed from Guarani &quot;guazu ara&quot;.

The name of Paraguay is itself a Guarani word, as is the name of Uruguay. However, the exact meaning of either placename is subject to varied interpretations. (&quot;See&quot;: List of country-name etymologies.)

== Example text ==
Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Guarani:
:

Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in English:
:&quot;All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.&quot;

== Literature ==
The New Testament was translated from Greek into Guarani by John William Lindsay (1875–1946), who was a Scottish medical missionary based in Belén, Paraguay. The New Testament was printed by the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1913. It is believed to be the first New Testament translated into any South American indigenous language.

A more modern translation of the whole Bible into Guarani is known as .

In 2019, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses released the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures in Guarani, both in print and online.

Recently a series of novels in Guarani have been published:
* (Tadeo Zarratea, 1981)
* (Hugo Centurión, 2016)
* (Arnaldo Casco Villalba, 2017)

<doc id="76236" wikidata="Q862682" url="?curid=76236" title="Ground effect (aerodynamics)">
<text>For fixed-wing aircraft, ground effect is the reduced aerodynamic drag that an aircraft&#x27;s wings generate when they are close to a fixed surface. During takeoff, ground effect can cause the aircraft to &quot;float&quot; while below the recommended climb speed. The pilot can then fly just above the runway while the aircraft accelerates in ground effect until a safe climb speed is reached.

For rotorcraft, ground effect results in less drag on the rotor during hovering close to the ground. At high weights this sometimes allows the rotorcraft to lift off while stationary in ground effect but does not allow it to transition to flight out of ground effect. Helicopter pilots are provided with performance charts which show the limitations for hovering their helicopter in ground effect (IGE) and out of ground effect (OGE). The charts show the added lift benefit produced by ground effect.

For fan and jet-powered vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft, ground effect when hovering can cause suckdown and fountain lift on the airframe and loss in hovering thrust if the engine sucks in its own exhaust gas, which is known as hot gas ingestion (HGI).

==Explanations==
===Fixed-wing aircraft===
When an aircraft flies at or below approximately half the length of the aircraft&#x27;s wingspan above the ground or water there occurs an often-noticeable &quot;ground effect.&quot; The result is lower induced drag on the aircraft. This is caused primarily by the ground or water obstructing the creation of wingtip vortices and interrupting downwash behind the wing.

A wing generates lift by deflecting the oncoming airmass (relative wind) downward. The deflected or &quot;turned&quot; flow of air creates a resultant force on the wing in the opposite direction (Newton&#x27;s third law). The resultant force is identified as lift. Flying close to a surface increases air pressure on the lower wing surface, nicknamed the &quot;ram&quot; or &quot;cushion&quot; effect, and thereby improves the aircraft lift-to-drag ratio. The nearer the wing is to the ground, the more pronounced the ground effect becomes. While in the ground effect, the wing requires a lower angle of attack to produce the same amount of lift. In wind tunnel tests, in which the angle of attack and airspeed remain constant, an increase in the lift coefficient ensues, which accounts for the &quot;floating&quot; effect. Ground effect also alters thrust versus velocity, where reduced induced drag requires less thrust in order to maintain the same velocity.

Low winged aircraft are more affected by ground effect than high wing aircraft. Due to the change in up-wash, down-wash, and wingtip vortices, there may be errors in the airspeed system while in ground effect due to changes in the local pressure at the static source.

===Rotorcraft===
When a hovering rotor is near the ground the downward flow of air through the rotor is reduced to zero at the ground. This condition is transferred up to the disc through pressure changes in the wake which decreases the inflow to the rotor for a given disc loading, which is rotor thrust for each square foot of its area. This gives a thrust increase for a particular blade pitch angle, or, alternatively, the power required for a thrust is reduced. For an overloaded helicopter that can only hover IGE it may be possible to climb away from the ground by translating to forward flight first while in ground effect. The ground-effect benefit disappears rapidly with speed but the induced power decreases rapidly as well to allow a safe climb. Some early underpowered helicopters could only hover close to the ground. Ground effect is at its maximum over a firm, smooth surface.

===VTOL aircraft===
There are two effects inherent to VTOL aircraft operating at zero and low speeds in ground effect, suckdown and fountain lift. A third, hot gas ingestion, may also apply to fixed-wing aircraft on the ground in windy conditions or during thrust reverser operation. How well, in terms of weight lifted, a VTOL aircraft hovers IGE depends on suckdown on the air frame, fountain impingement on the underside of the fuselage and HGI into the engine causing inlet temperature rise (ITR). Suckdown works against the engine lift as a downward force on the airframe. Fountain flow works with the engine lift jets as an upwards force. The severity of the HGI problem becomes clear when the level of ITR is converted into engine thrust loss, three to four percent per 12.222 °c inlet temperature rise.

Suckdown is the result of entrainment of air around aircraft by lift jets when hovering. It also occurs in free air (OGE) causing loss of lift by reducing pressures on the underside of the fuselage and wings. Enhanced entrainment occurs when close to the ground giving higher lift loss. Fountain lift occurs when an aircraft has two or more lift jets. The jets strike the ground and spread out. Where they meet under the fuselage they mix and can only move upwards striking the underside of the fuselage. How well their upward momentum is diverted sideways or downward determines the lift. Fountain flow follows a curved fuselage underbody and retains some momentum in an upward direction so less than full fountain lift is captured unless lift improvement devices are fitted. HGI reduces engine thrust because the air entering the engine is hotter and less dense than cold air.

Early VTOL experimental aircraft operated from open grids to channel away the engine exhaust and prevent thrust loss from HGI.

The Bell X-14, built to research early VTOL technology, was unable to hover until suckdown effects were reduced by raising the aircraft with longer landing gear legs. It also had to operate from an elevated platform of perforated steel to reduce HGI. The Dassault Mirage IIIV VTOL research aircraft only ever operated vertically from a grid which allowed engine exhaust to be channeled away from the aircraft to avoid suckdown and HGI effects.

Ventral strakes retroactively fitted to the P.1127 improved flow and increased pressure under the belly in low altitude hovering. Gun pods fitted in the same position on the production Harrier GR.1/GR.3 and the AV-8A Harrier did the same thing. Further lift improvement devices (LIDS) were developed for the AV-8B and Harrier II. To box in the belly region where the lift-enhancing fountains strike the aircraft, strakes were added to the underside of the gun pods and a hinged dam could be lowered to block the gap between the front ends of the strakes. This gave a 1200 lb lift gain.

Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II weapons-bay inboard doors on the F-35B open to capture fountain flow created by the engine and fan lift jets and counter suckdown IGE.
===Wing stall in ground effect===
The stalling angle of attack is less in ground effect, by approximately 2–4 degrees, than in free air. When the flow separates there is a large increase in drag. If the aircraft overrotates on take-off at too low a speed the increased drag can prevent the aircraft from leaving the ground. Two de Havilland Comets overran the end of the runway after overrotating. Loss of control may occur if one wing tip stalls in ground effect. During certification testing of the Gulfstream G650 business jet the test aircraft rotated to an angle beyond the predicted IGE stalling angle. The over-rotation caused one wing-tip to stall and an uncommanded roll, which overpowered the lateral controls, leading to loss of the aircraft.

==Ground-effect vehicle==
A few vehicles have been designed to explore the performance advantages of flying in ground effect, mainly over water. The operational disadvantages of flying very close to the surface have discouraged widespread applications.

<doc id="76239" wikidata="Q3131912" url="?curid=76239" title="Henry Rich, 1st Earl of Holland">
<text>Henry Rich, 1st Earl of Holland (baptised 15 August 1590, died 9 March 1649), was an English courtier and politician executed by Parliament after being captured fighting for the Royalists during the Second English Civil War. Younger brother of Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick, a Puritan activist and commander of the Parliamentarian navy during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, Henry was better known as an &quot;extravagant, decorative, quarrelsome and highly successful courtier&quot;. 

A close friend of Charles I and his favourite the Duke of Buckingham, Rich performed various diplomatic errands, including negotiations for Charles&#x27; marriage to Henrietta Maria of France in 1625. He took part in the unsuccessful attack on Saint-Martin-de-Ré in 1627 and held a number of important positions at court during the 1630s. When the First English Civil War began in August 1642, Rich remained in London rather than joining the Royalists, but like other moderates became disillusioned with the war. He defected in July 1643 after failing to persuade his cousin and commander-in-chief of the Parliamentarian army, Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex, to negotiate peace terms. 

When Charles agreed a truce with the Catholic Confederation in September 1643, Rich returned to London and narrowly escaped being tried for treason. After peace talks between Charles and Parliament broke down in late 1647, he fought for the Royalists in the Second English Civil War and was captured in July 1648. Having escaped trial previously, he was executed in March 1649, although Rich claimed he had always been faithful to Parliament and never changed the &quot;principles that ever I professed&quot;. This was a view shared by many Parliamentarian moderates, particularly after the Execution of Charles I in January 1649.

==Early life==
Henry Rich, later Lord Holland, was the second son and youngest of four children born to Robert Rich, 1st Earl of Warwick (1559–1619) and his first wife Penelope (1563–1607). His parents separated soon after Henry&#x27;s birth, although they did not formally divorce until 1605, when Penelope married her long-time partner, Charles Blount, 8th Baron Mountjoy (1563–1606). Penelope was sister of the Earl of Essex, executed for treason in 1601, making Rich a cousin to future Parliamentarian general Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex. 

He had two sisters, Essex (1585–1658) and Lettice (1587–1619) and a brother Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick (1587–1658). He also had a number of half brothers and sisters, including Penelope (b. 1592), Isabella, Mountjoy Blount, 1st Earl of Newport (1597–1666), and Charles (1605–1627). Almost certainly fathered by Charles Mountjoy, these children were brought up within the Rich family and appear in its pedigree, with the exception of Mountjoy, who was legitimised after his father&#x27;s death. 

His father Robert was the wealthiest landowner in Essex, created Earl of Warwick in 1618, and a prominent supporter of reforms within the Church of England, as were his sons. However, while his elder brother was a devout Puritan throughout his life, Henry acquired a reputation as an &quot;extravagant, decorative, quarrelsome and highly successful courtier&quot;. 

In 1612, he married Isabel Cope, whose dowry included Cope House in Kensington. This was greatly expanded by Rich in 1624 to 1625 and renamed Holland House; largely destroyed in 1940, parts of the original house still remain. They had numerous children, including Frances (1617–1672), who married William_Paget,_5th_Baron_Paget, Robert (1619–1675), Henry (1620–1669), Isabella (1623–1670), Susannah (1628–1649), Diana (d. 1659), Charles (d. 1645), Cope (1635–1676) and Mary (1636–1666). Several of the family tombs are at St Mary Abbots Church, Kensington.

==Career; pre-1639==
Rich was educated at Eton and graduated from Emmanuel College, Cambridge in 1603. Reportedly a godson of Henry IV of France, he travelled to Paris in 1607 before returning to England in 1610. Elected as MP for the vacant seat of Leicester in May, he was knighted in June when James I&#x27;s heir Henry was created Prince of Wales. Shortly thereafter, he served as a volunteer in the Siege of Jülich (1610), part of the War of the Jülich Succession which preceded the wider conflict of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. 

As was then common, Rich completed his education by studying law at the Inner Temple in 1611 and was re-elected for Leicester in the short-lived Addled Parliament of 1614. Clarendon later wrote he was ideally suited to the Jacobean era court, being &quot;a very handsome man, of a lovely and winning presence&quot;. However, wealth was also a prerequisite; his father-in-law Sir Walter Cope died in 1614 with debts of over £27,000, greatly impacting Rich&#x27;s ability to advance. 

Rich became close to Charles, installed as heir to the throne when Prince Henry died in 1612, as well as his favourite, the Duke of Buckingham. He took part in various diplomatic missions and briefly served as a volunteer in the Eighty Years War, before being created Baron Kensington in 1623. The next year he was made a member of the Privy Council of England, and sent to Paris to help negotiate the marriage contract between Charles and Henrietta Maria of France, a process completed by James Hay. When Charles succeeded his father in March 1625, Hay was made Earl of Carlisle and Rich Earl of Holland, taking his title from an area in Lincolnshire. 

In 1627, Rich was involved in the disastrous Siege of Saint-Martin-de-Ré, which led to Buckingham&#x27;s impeachment by Parliament; although this failed, he was assassinated on 23 August 1628. The next day, Rich wrote to Charles claiming he had been promised the position Governor of Windsor Castle. This request was granted, along with an appointment as Governor of Landguard Fort, and he benefited from his relationship with Henrietta Maria, who had replaced Buckingham as Charles&#x27; closest advisor. Over the next few months, he was made Lord Lieutenant of Berkshire and Middlesex, Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, and numerous other offices. 

Although he failed to become First Lord of the Admiralty, the 1630s was the highpoint of his career as a courtier; as a Privy councillor, he was frequently consulted on foreign affairs, although his anti-Spanish policy was at odds with that pursued by Charles. In 1636, he was appointed Groom of the Stool; by this stage the term indicated proximity to the monarch rather than function, and the officeholder was an important part of the Royal household. 

==Career; Wars of the Three Kingdoms==
Despite his close links to the court and reputation for extravagance and ambition, Lord Conway described Rich and his brother Warwick as the &quot;temporal and spiritual heads of the Puritans&quot;. This shows the danger of conflating &quot;Roundhead&quot; and &quot;Puritan&quot;, which often implied a political outlook as much as a moral one. While the majority supported Parliament during the civil war, men like Sir William Savile were equally opposed to Catholicism but became Royalists out of a sense of personal loyalty. 

Rich used his patronage to appoint &quot;Godly&quot; clergy, while opposing Laudianism and &quot;Popery&quot;, causing a breach with Henrietta Maria, who was a devout Catholic. In addition, he supported two causes central to the Puritan movement, the first being the restoration of Charles&#x27; Protestant nephew, Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine, to his hereditary lands in the Electoral Palatinate. 

The second was participation in the colonial movement, which sought to establish English possessions in the West Indies and North America, then dominated by Spain. Rich supported colonies in Virginia and Bermuda and from 1630 to 1642 was governor of the Providence Island Company. While his attendance at company meetings was irregular, he helped secure funding and support for its activities, including Privateer attacks on Spanish merchant ships. Many of his colleagues were leaders of the Parliamentarian opposition in 1641, including John Pym, John Hampden, Lord Saye and Lord Brooke. 

The Wars of the Three Kingdoms began in 1639 with the first of the two Bishops&#x27; Wars against the Scots Covenanters; Rich served as General of Horse in a chaotic campaign that ended without significant action. A second defeat in 1640 forced Charles to recall Parliament in November, which impeached both Archbishop Laud and the Earl of Strafford. A long-time opponent of Strafford, Rich gave evidence against him but abstained from the vote which led to his execution in May 1641. 

Although Charles appointed him commander of the militia in Northern England, Rich sided with Parliament at the start of the First English Civil War in August 1642. Many on both sides expected a short, relatively bloodless conflict and were shocked by the casualties incurred at Edgehill in October 1642. In early 1643, Rich tried to persuade his cousin and Army commander Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex to force Parliament to make peace; when this failed, he defected to the Royalists at Oxford. Although present at Newbury in September, he was treated with indifference by Charles and returned to Westminster in November, reportedly because he opposed the &quot;Cessation&quot; negotiated by Royalists in Ireland with the Catholic Confederacy. 

He resumed his seat in the House of Lords, while an attempt to impeach him for treason was blocked by Denzil Holles, head of the &quot;Peace&quot; faction in Parliament. Rich was one of ten lords appointed to the Westminster Assembly, a body established with Scottish representatives to agree reforms for the Church of England. By the time Charles surrendered in June 1646, his opponents were divided between moderates led by Holles who dominated Parliament and radicals within the New Model Army, headed by Oliver Cromwell. After negotiations between the king and Parliament broke down in late 1647, the Scots, English moderates and Royalists created an alliance to restore Charles to the throne. The Second English Civil War began in April 1648.

On 4 July, a petition was presented to Parliament demanding the resumption of negotiations with Charles, and on the same day, Rich and George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham raised 400 cavalry in an attempt to seize London. This was insufficient for the task and the Royalists retreated through Surrey, before being intercepted and scattered outside Surbiton by Sir Michael Livesey. Rich and 200 men reached St Neots on Sunday 9 July, along with Colonel John Dalbier, an experienced German mercenary who served with him in the 1627 Saint-Martin-de-Ré expedition. 

The next day, they were attacked by a detachment from the New Model under Colonel Adrian Scrope; Dalbier was killed, Buckingham escaped to France and Rich taken prisoner to Windsor Castle. The war ended with Parliamentarian victory at Preston in August, followed by the Execution of Charles I on 30 January 1649. On 27 February, Rich was taken to London for trial; many felt he should have been punished in 1643 and despite pleas from his brother Warwick, he was executed on 9 March along with Lord Capell and the Duke of Hamilton.

Shortly before his death, Rich composed a statement arguing he had always been faithful to Parliament, a &quot;remarkable claim for someone who had deserted them twice&quot;. However, the suggestion he never changed the &quot;principles that ever I professed&quot; and was more consistent than those responsible for executing Charles was a view shared by many Parliamentarian moderates.

<text>Mount Shasta ( ; Shasta: &quot;Waka-nunee-Tuki-wuki&quot;; Karuk: &quot;Úytaahkoo&quot;) is a potentially active stratovolcano at the southern end of the Cascade Range in Siskiyou County, California. At an elevation of , it is the second-highest peak in the Cascades and the fifth-highest in the state. Mount Shasta has an estimated volume of , which makes it the most voluminous volcano in the Cascade Volcanic Arc.
The mountain and surrounding area are part of the Shasta–Trinity National Forest.

== Description ==
The origin of the name &quot;Shasta&quot; is vague, either derived from a people of a name like it or otherwise garbled by early Westerners. Mount Shasta is connected to its satellite cone of Shastina, and together they dominate the landscape. Shasta rises abruptly to tower nearly above its surroundings. On a clear winter day, the mountain can be seen from the floor of the Central Valley to the south. The mountain has attracted the attention of poets, authors, and presidents.

The mountain consists of four overlapping dormant volcanic cones that have built a complex shape, including the main summit and the prominent and visibly conical satellite cone of Shastina. If Shastina were a separate mountain, it would rank as the fourth-highest peak of the Cascade Range (after Mount Rainier, Rainier&#x27;s Liberty Cap, and Mount Shasta itself).

Mount Shasta&#x27;s surface is relatively free of deep glacial erosion except, paradoxically, for its south side where Sargents Ridge runs parallel to the U-shaped Avalanche Gulch. This is the largest glacial valley on the volcano, although it does not now have a glacier in it. There are seven named glaciers on Mount Shasta, with the four largest (Whitney, Bolam, Hotlum, and Wintun) radiating down from high on the main summit cone to below primarily on the north and east sides. The Whitney Glacier is the longest, and the Hotlum is the most voluminous glacier in the state of California. Three of the smaller named glaciers occupy cirques near and above on the south and southeast sides, including the Watkins, Konwakiton, and Mud Creek glaciers.

== History ==
The oldest-known human settlement in the area dates to about 7,000 years ago.

At the time of Euro-American contact in the 1810s, the Native American tribes who lived within view of Mount Shasta included the Shasta, Okwanuchu, Modoc, Achomawi, Atsugewi, Karuk, Klamath, Wintu, and Yana tribes.

A historic eruption of Mount Shasta in 1786 may have been observed by Lapérouse, but this is disputed. Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s Global Volcanism Program says that the 1786 eruption is discredited, and that the last known eruption of Mount Shasta was around 1250 AD, proved by uncorrected radiocarbon dating.

Although earlier Spanish explorers are likely to have sighted the mountain, the first written record and description was made on May 20, 1817, by Spaniard Narciso Durán, a member of the Luis Antonio Argüello expedition into the upper areas of the Sacramento River Valley, who wrote &quot;At about ten leagues to the northwest of this place we saw the very high hill called by soldiers that went near its slope Jesus Maria, It is entirely covered with snow.&quot; Peter Skene Ogden (a leader of a Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company trapping brigade) in 1826 recorded sighting the mountain, and in 1827, the name &quot;Sasty&quot; or &quot;Sastise&quot; was given to nearby Mount McLoughlin by Ogden. An 1839 map by David Burr lists the mountain as Rogers Peak. This name was apparently dropped, and the name Shasta was transferred to present-day Mount Shasta in 1841, partly as a result of work by the United States Exploring Expedition.

Beginning in the 1820s, Mount Shasta was a prominent landmark along what became known as the Siskiyou Trail, which runs at Mount Shasta&#x27;s base. The Siskiyou Trail was on the track of an ancient trade and travel route of Native American footpaths between California&#x27;s Central Valley and the Pacific Northwest.

The California Gold Rush brought the first Euro-American settlements into the area in the early 1850s, including at Yreka, California and Upper Soda Springs. The first recorded ascent of Mount Shasta occurred in 1854 (by Elias Pearce), after several earlier failed attempts. In 1856, the first women (Harriette Eddy, Mary Campbell McCloud, and their party) reached the summit.

By the 1860s and 1870s, Mount Shasta was the subject of scientific and literary interest. In 1854 John Rollin Ridge titled a poem &quot;Mount Shasta.&quot; A book by California pioneer and entrepreneur James Hutchings, titled &quot;Scenes of Wonder and Curiosity in California&quot;, contained an account of an early summit trip in 1855. The summit was achieved (or nearly so) by John Muir, Josiah Whitney, Clarence King, and John Wesley Powell. In 1877, Muir wrote a dramatic popular article about his surviving an overnight blizzard on Mount Shasta by lying in the hot sulfur springs near the summit. This experience was inspiration to Kim Stanley Robinson&#x27;s short story &quot;Muir on Shasta&quot;.

The 1887 completion of the Central Pacific Railroad, built along the line of the Siskiyou Trail between California and Oregon, brought a substantial increase in tourism, lumbering, and population into the area around Mount Shasta. Early resorts and hotels, such as Shasta Springs and Upper Soda Springs, grew up along the Siskiyou Trail around Mount Shasta, catering to these early adventuresome tourists and mountaineers.

In the early 20th century, the Pacific Highway followed the track of the Siskiyou Trail to the base of Mount Shasta, leading to still more access to the mountain. Today&#x27;s version of the Siskiyou Trail, Interstate 5, brings thousands of people each year to Mount Shasta.

From February 13–19, 1959, the Mount Shasta Ski Bowl obtained the record for the most snowfall during one storm in the U.S., with a total of .

Mount Shasta was declared a National Natural Landmark in December 1976.

The &quot;Shasta Gulch&quot; is referenced in the lyrics to the 1994 song &quot;Unfair&quot; by cult indie rock band Pavement.

=== Legends ===
The lore of some of the Klamath Tribes in the area held that Mount Shasta is inhabited by the Spirit of the Above-World, Skell, who descended from heaven to the mountain&#x27;s summit at the request of a Klamath chief. Skell fought with Spirit of the Below-World, Llao, who resided at Mount Mazama by throwing hot rocks and lava, probably representing the volcanic eruptions at both mountains.

Italian settlers arrived in the early 1900s to work in the mills as stonemasons and established a strong Catholic presence in the area. Mount Shasta City and Dunsmuir, California, small towns near Shasta&#x27;s western base, are focal points for many of these, which range from a Buddhist monastery (Shasta Abbey, founded by Houn Jiyu-Kennett in 1971) to modern-day Native American rituals. A group of Native Americans from the McCloud River area practice rituals on the mountain.

Mount Shasta has also been a focus for non-Native American legends, centered on a hidden city of advanced beings from the lost continent of Lemuria. The legend grew from an offhand mention of Lemuria in the 1880s, to a description of a hidden Lemurian village in 1925. In 1931, Harvey Spencer Lewis, using the pseudonym Wishar S[penle] Cerve, wrote &quot;Lemuria: the lost continent of the Pacific&quot;, published by AMORC, about the hidden Lemurians of Mount Shasta that cemented the legend in many readers&#x27; minds.

In August 1987, believers in the spiritual significance of the Harmonic Convergence described Mount Shasta as one of a small number of global &quot;power centers&quot;. Mount Shasta remains a focus of &quot;New Age&quot; attention.

According to Guy Ballard, while hiking on Mount Shasta, he encountered a man who, introducing himself as the Count of St. Germain, is said to have started Ballard on the path to discovering the teachings that would become the &quot;I AM&quot; Activity religious movement.

In 2009, a group of hikers were making their way up Mt. Shasta when they reported seeing a flying humanoid creature with batlike features. They described what they saw as a man “stocky as Hulk Hogan, with leathery wings fifty feet from one end to the other and the face of a bat.” Despite the conflicting details, both accounts have been added to the legend of Batsquatch as additional proof.

in 2024, a 20-foot bronze statue of the Virgin Mary was built in the Ski Park. The statue was built in memory of Ray Merlo, husband and business partner of the Ski Park&#x27;s owner, Robin Merlo. Ray Merlo passed away from cancer in 2020.

== Geology ==
About 593,000 years ago, andesitic lavas erupted in what is now Mount Shasta&#x27;s western flank near McBride Spring. Over time, an ancestral Mount Shasta stratovolcano was built to a large but unknown height; sometime between 300,000 and 360,000 years ago the entire north side of the volcano collapsed, creating an enormous landslide or debris avalanche, in volume. The slide flowed northwestward into Shasta Valley, where the Shasta River now cuts through the flow.

What remains of the oldest of Mount Shasta&#x27;s four cones is exposed at Sargents Ridge on the south side of the mountain. Lavas from the Sargents Ridge vent cover the Everitt Hill shield at Mount Shasta&#x27;s southern foot. The last lavas to erupt from the vent were hornblende-pyroxene andesites with a hornblende dacite dome at its summit. Glacial erosion has since modified its shape.

The next cone to form is exposed south of Mount Shasta&#x27;s current summit and is called Misery Hill. It was formed 15,000 to 20,000 years ago from pyroxene andesite flows and has since been intruded by a hornblende dacite dome.

There are many buried glacial scars on the mountain that were created in recent glacial periods (&quot;ice ages&quot;) of the present Wisconsinian glaciation. Most have since been filled in with andesite lava, pyroclastic flows, and talus from lava domes. Shastina, by comparison, has a fully intact summit crater indicating Shastina developed after the last ice age. Shastina has been built by mostly pyroxene andesite lava flows. Some 9,500 years ago, these flows reached about south and north of the area now occupied by nearby Black Butte. The last eruptions formed Shastina&#x27;s present summit about a hundred years later. But before that, Shastina, along with the then forming Black Butte dacite plug dome complex to the west, created numerous pyroclastic flows that covered , including large parts of what is now Mount Shasta, California and Weed, California. Diller Canyon ( deep and wide) is an avalanche chute that was probably carved into Shastina&#x27;s western face by these flows.

The last to form, and the highest cone, the Hotlum Cone, formed about 8,000 years ago. It is named after the Hotlum glacier on its northern face; its longest lava flow, the Military Pass flow, extends down its northeast face. Since the creation of the Hotlum Cone, a dacite dome intruded the cone and now forms the summit. The rock at the summit crater has been extensively hydrothermally altered by sulfurous hot springs and fumaroles there (only a few examples still remain).

In the last 8,000 years, the Hotlum Cone has erupted at least eight or nine times. About 200 years ago, the last significant Mount Shasta eruption came from this cone and created a pyroclastic flow, a hot lahar (mudflow), and three cold lahars, which streamed down Mount Shasta&#x27;s east flank via Ash Creek. A separate hot lahar went down Mud Creek. This eruption was thought to have been observed by the explorer La Pérouse, from his ship off the California coast, in 1786, but this has been disputed.

=== Volcanic status ===
During the last 10,000 years, Mount Shasta has erupted an average of every 800 years, but in the past 4,500 years the volcano has erupted an average of every 600 years.
USGS seismometers and GPS receivers operated by UNAVCO form the monitoring network for Mount Shasta. The volcano has been relatively quiet during the 21st century, with only a handful of small magnitude earthquakes and no demonstrable ground deformation. Although geophysically quiet, periodic geochemical surveys indicate that volcanic gas emanates from a fumarole at the summit of Mount Shasta from a deep-seated reservoir of partly molten rock.
Mount Shasta can release volcanic ash, pyroclastic flows or dacite and andesite lava. Its deposits can be detected under nearby small towns. Mount Shasta has an explosive, eruptive history. There are fumaroles on the mountain, which show Mount Shasta is still alive.

The worst-case scenario for an eruption is a large pyroclastic flow, similar to that which occurred in the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. Since there is ice, such as Whitney Glacier and Mud Creek Glacier, lahars would also result.

The United States Geological Survey monitors Mount Shasta and rates it as a very high-threat volcano.

== Climbing ==
The summer climbing season runs from late April until October, although many attempts are made in the winter. Mount Shasta is also a popular destination for backcountry skiing. Many of the climbing routes can be descended by experienced skiers, and there are numerous lower-angled areas around the base of the mountain.

No quota system currently exists for climbing Mount Shasta, and reservations are not required. However, climbers must obtain a summit pass and a wilderness permit to climb the mountain.

<text>Carloman (, ; c. 830 – 22 March 880) was a Frankish king of the Carolingian dynasty. He was the eldest son of Louis the German, king of East Francia, and Hemma, daughter of a Bavarian count. His father appointed him governor of Carantania in 856, and commander of southeastern frontier marches in 864. Upon his father&#x27;s death in 876 he became king of Bavaria. He was appointed by King Louis II of Italy as his successor, but the Kingdom of Italy was taken by his uncle Charles the Bald in 875. Carloman only conquered it in 877. In 879 he was incapacitated, perhaps by a stroke, and abdicated his domains in favour of his younger brothers: Bavaria to Louis the Younger and Italy to Charles the Fat.

==Early life==
Carloman&#x27;s birth date is unknown, but was probably around 828 or 830. His naming can be connected to his father&#x27;s push to rule Alemannia around the time of his father&#x27;s assembly of Worms in 829. The first member of the Carolingian dynasty named Carloman had ruled Alemannia in 741–48, and subjugated it to the Franks.

Carloman was old enough to participate in the civil war of 840–43, waged between his father and his uncles, Lothair and Charles the Bald. His first record public appearance is as the leader of an army of reinforcements from Bavaria and Alemannia which he brought to his father at Worms in 842. He subsequently led them in battle alongside his father and uncle (Charles the Bald) against his other uncle (Lothair). It was the beginning of a warlike career. Notker of Saint Gall, who bewailed the decline of the dynasty a generation later, called Carloman &quot;bellicosissimus&quot; (literally &quot;most warlike&quot;, or in historian Eric Goldberg&#x27;s words a &quot;real ass-kicker&quot;).

In October 848, Carloman was present at his father&#x27;s council in Regensburg, where the Slavic commander (&quot;dux&quot;) Pribina was rewarded for his service in defending the Bavarian frontier. In the charter confirming the grant, Carloman signed his name first among the secular magnates (after the ecclesiastics).

In the 840s, Carloman had a liaison with Liutswind, daughter of the Bavarian count Ratolt and sister-in-law of Count Sigihard of the Kraichgau. This was Carloman&#x27;s first politically independent action, and it confirms his close connection to Bavaria. Around 850, Liutswind bore him a son, Arnulf. This name was chosen because it was distinctly dynastic (the founder of the Carolingian family was Bishop Arnulf of Metz), yet had never been used by a reigning king and was thus appropriate for an illegitimate eldest son. The choice of the name is the surest evidence that Liutswind and Carloman were not legally married. Around 860, Arnulf and his cousin, Hugh, the illegitimate son of Carloman&#x27;s brother Louis, were both in Koblenz at the court of their grandfather, who was probably overseeing their military education and also holding them to ensure the good behaviour of their fathers.

==Guardian of the southeastern frontiers==

In 856, Louis first associated Carloman with his rule by appointing him governor of Carantania. According to the &quot;Annales Fuldenses&quot; (863), he was given the title &quot;prelate of the Carantanians&quot; (). Since this was his first governorship, Louis did not give him rule over the entire March of Pannonia, with traditional seat of frontier governor (prefect) at Tulln. Instead, Carloman was given rule over the inner region (Carantania), in order do gain experience, and perhaps because his father wanted to keep him from trying to seize too much power.

Gaining the first foothold of power in Carantania, Carloman moved to assume a more prominent role in governorship over the frontier regions of his father&#x27;s realm. Starting from 857, Carloman was an occasional witness to his father&#x27;s charters, and already in 858 he was appointed to lead a military expedition against the Great Moravia.

In 861, Carloman came into conflict with several frontier commanders in southeastern regions, expelled them from their offices, and replaced them with his loyals. That move was made without his fathers consent, and by 862 an open conflict erupted, with Carloman siding with Rastislav of Moravia and taking control over all southeastern regions, advancing further into Bavaria, up to the river Inn. An attempted reconciliation and truce between father and son failed, and in 863 king Louis invaded his son&#x27;s territory, forced Carloman into submission, and took him into custody.

Replaced by count Gundachar, who was appointed governor of eastern marches by king Louis (863), prince Carloman remained in his father custody until 864, when he escaped and returned to Carantania. Welcomed by supporters, he assumed power in the province. At that time, king Louis was campaigning against Moravia, but ceased further operations and moved south, towards Carantania. Conflict was avoided by reconciliation. Father and son met and reached an agreement. Carloman submitted to his father and in return he was granted governorship over eastern marches.

Carloman&#x27;s letter to his father from 869 survives, describing conditions on the frontier. In 870, he succeeded in establishing Frankish domination over Great Moravia, through arrangement with Svatopluk, who captured his uncle Rastislav of Moravia, ruling prince of Moravia, and gave him over to Carloman. During the following Frankish invasion, Moravian archbishop Methodius was also captured and sent to Carloman. In 871, he managed to capture Svatopluk, thus establishing direct control over the entire principality, but soon decided to reinstall him, in order to pacify the country. That proved to be disastrous, since Svatopluk, as soon as reaching Moravia, turned against Carloman, inflicting severe losses on Frankish army.

In 873, after several interventions of Pope John VIII, including those made to Carloman, a peace settlement was reached in Forchheim, between king Louis and envoys of Svatopluk, thus concluding the state of war on eastern borders.

==Division of Frankfurt==
In order to prevent future dynastic conflicts, king Louis decided to regulate the position of his three sons within the government. In 865, an arrangement on the future succession was reached and promulgated in Frankfurt, thus becoming known as the &quot;Division of Frankfurt&quot;. Bavaria and southeastern marches were designated to Carloman, Saxony and Franconia to Louis the Younger, and Alamannia to Charles the Fat. Princes were to become rulers of designated domains only upon their father&#x27;s death. None of them was given the title of a king during his father&#x27;s lifetime, but their position within the state affairs was regulated in detail, with king Louis keeping all of the main prerogatives of royal power.

At the same time, all of king&#x27;s sons married into the local aristocracy of the regions marked out for them. Carloman married the daughter of a Bavarian military leader (&quot;dux&quot;) named Ernest, whom the &quot;Annales Bertiniani&quot; describe as &quot;the greatest of all the king&#x27;s great men&quot;. This marriage must have taken place before Ernest&#x27;s disgrace and dismissal in 861, for Louis the German strongly disapproved of his second son&#x27;s seeking a marriage with family that had likewise been disgraced in 858–59.

By the 870s, according to the &quot;Annales Bertiniani&quot;, at the time being composed by Archbishop Hincmar of Reims, Carloman&#x27;s mother, Emma, was encouraging her husband to favour Carloman over his brothers. This is the first recorded involvement of Emma in politics, and it may relate to Louis&#x27;s illness during 869–70. On the other hand, historian Ernst Dümmler thought Carloman must have been a &quot;mamma&#x27;s boy&quot; (&quot;Muttersöhnchen&quot;).

==Ruler of Bavaria==

In Bavaria, Carloman re-founded the palace and monastery at Ötting. He dedicated it to the Virgin Mary and &quot;numerous other saints whose relics we were able to collect with God&#x27;s help&quot;. He appointed his father&#x27;s friend, the linguistic scholar Baldo, as his chancellor. In 878, he may have been the object of an assassination attempt. According to the &quot;Annales Iuvavenses&quot;, the king &quot;was surrounded by Count Ermenpert and some of his soldiers&quot; at Ergolding, but the count apparently fled to West Francia, where he was received by Louis the Stammerer.

Carloman groomed his illegitimate son Arnulf for the succession in Bavaria. In a charter issued at Regensburg, he called him &quot;regal son&quot; (&quot;filius regalis&quot;), a term similar to &quot;the king&#x27;s son&quot; (&quot;filius regis&quot;), which was the standard title of a legitimate royal son. This policy had supporters, like Abbot Regino of Prüm and the monks of Saint Gall, but also detractors, who appealed to Carloman&#x27;s brother Louis. In early 879, Carloman was incapacitated by illness, perhaps a stroke. Louis came to Bavaria to receive the recognition of the aristocracy as future king. By Easter he had left, and Arnulf took control of the kingdom in his father&#x27;s name. He dismissed some prominent counts, who appealed to Louis to restore them. Carloman tried to legitimise Arnulf&#x27;s actions by adding his son&#x27;s name to the prayer provisions of his charters, but in November Louis came to Bavaria to force a resolution of the succession. He restored the deposed counts and Carloman formally abdicated his Bavarian throne to his brother. He also placed Arnulf under Louis&#x27;s protection. His brother Charles dated his reign in Italy from November 879, so presumably Carloman abdicated that kingdom at the same time as Bavaria.

==Ruler of Italy==

On 12 August 875, Louis II of Italy died and his kingdom was claimed by Louis the German for his sons Carloman and Charles and by Charles the Bald. Pope John VIII, dealing with the constant threat of raiders from Muslim Sicily, sided with Charles the Bald. Carloman led an army into Italy, where he granted a diploma to the monastery of San Clemente a Casauria, one of Louis II&#x27;s most favored houses. In the diploma Carloman declared himself Louis&#x27;s chosen successor. According to the &quot;Annales Fuldenses&quot;, Charles had to offer him &quot;a huge sum in gold and silver and precious stones&quot; to get him to leave Italy. On 28 August 876, Louis died and his sons became kings in their allotted kingdoms. On 6 October 877, Charles the Bald died and later that month Carloman succeeded in having himself elected King of Italy by the nobles assembled in Pavia. The lure of Italy was &quot;the looting which was apparently acceptable when a king first took over a kingdom&quot;, providing rewards that could be shared out among followers and more than offset the cost of raising an army and crossing the Alps. Carloman was one of only two Carolingian kings of Italy—his brother and successor Charles being the other—who did not issue a capitulary at the beginning of his reign in order to proclaim his legitimacy and affirm his keeping to traditions of good government.

In Italy, Carloman confirmed his predecessor&#x27;s act that made bishops permanent &quot;missi dominici&quot; (royal representatives) in their dioceses. He added to the new regulation by expanding the jurisdiction of individual bishops to gain their loyalty. His grant to Bishop Wibod of Parma of the &quot;districtio&quot;, or temporal authority in the district outside the city walls, was the first grant of its kind to a bishop. By the time of Carloman&#x27;s death, the confirmation of a predecessor&#x27;s concessions to the episcopate and the negotiating of new ones in exchange for support had become an Italian tradition. In 876, Charles had granted Pope John jurisdictional rights in the duchies of Spoleto and Camerino. After his succession, Carloman supported the dukes, Lambert I and Guy III, who had always claimed the rights as royal representatives which Charles had offered the pope.

In 879, Carloman donated land to the monastery of Santa Cristina by the royal palace at Olona. Although the monastery was reportedly built during the eighth century, the first record of its dedication to Cristina is found in Carloman&#x27;s charter. In a letter of 7 June 879, Pope John, having failed to convince Louis the Stammerer, Charles the Bald&#x27;s heir, to come to Italy for its defence, appealed to Carloman, whom he had previously rejected. It was too late; by then Carloman was incapacitated. Shortly before his abdication, he granted a complex of estates around Olona to the church of San Sisto, which had been founded by Queen Engelberga in Piacenza.

In Italy, Carloman had &quot;denarii&quot; (pennies) minted at Milan and Pavia. Those minted at Milan generally bore the inscription , while those of Pavia bore . All had a stylised temple on one side. Carloman did not issue coinage in Bavaria.

==Illness and death==
Regarding Carloman&#x27;s condition, the &quot;Annales Fuldenses&quot; (879) record that he lost his voice, but was still able to communicate by writing. Regino of Prüm, writing in his chronicle for the year 880, recalls that he was &quot;erudite in letters&quot; (&quot;litteris eruditus&quot;), which meant he could write Latin. Regino&#x27;s entire encomium on Carloman goes:

Most sources place Carloman&#x27;s death in March 880, but the &quot;Annales Iuvavenses&quot; place it on 21 September. He was buried in the chapel of his palace at Ötting. Carloman left one illegitimate son, Arnulf, who continued as margrave of Carinthia during the reigns of Carloman&#x27;s brothers, but in 887 became king of East Francia and in 896 emperor.

<doc id="76249" wikidata="Q962547" url="?curid=76249" title="Chindōgu">
<text>is the practice of inventing ingenious everyday gadgets that seem to be ideal solutions to particular problems, but which may cause more problems than they solve. The term is of Japanese origin.

==Background==
Literally translated, &quot;chindōgu&quot; means . The term was coined by Kenji Kawakami, a former editor and contributor to the Japanese home-shopping magazine &quot;Mail Order Life&quot;. In the magazine, Kawakami used his spare pages to showcase several bizarre prototypes for products. He named these gadgets &quot;chindōgu&quot;; Kawakami himself said that a more appropriate translation than &quot;unusual tool&quot; is &quot;weird tool&quot;. This special category of inventions subsequently became familiar to the Japanese people. 

Dan Papia then introduced it to the English-speaking world and popularized it as a monthly feature in his magazine, &quot;Tokyo Journal&quot;, encouraging readers to send in ideas. In 1995, Kawakami and Papia collaborated on the English language book &quot;101 Unuseless Japanese Inventions: The Art of Chindōgu&quot;. Most classic chindogu products are collected in the book. Many examples display a sense of humor in the way they are used.
Examples from the books include:
* A combined household duster and cocktail-shaker, for the housewife who wants to reward herself as she is going along.
* The all-day tissue dispenser, which is a toilet roll fixed on top of a hat, for hay fever sufferers.
* The all-over plastic bathing suit, to enable people who suffer from aquaphobia to swim without coming into contact with water.
* The baby mop, an outfit worn by babies, so that as they crawl around, the floor is cleaned.
* The selfie stick. While dismissed as a &quot;useless invention&quot; at the time, it later gained global popularity in the 21st century.

==The International Chindogu Society==

Kawakami founded the International Chindogu Society to popularize Chindogu worldwide. Papia is the president of the society&#x27;s U.S. chapter. People who invent a Chindogu can write about their creation on the society&#x27;s website.

===Ten tenets of chindōgu===

The Chindōgu Society developed ten tenets of chindōgu explaining the principles (spirits) on which chindogu products should be based, inspiring designers and users to think about the deep core of design in general. The tenets require that a chindōgu

* cannot be for real use,
* must exist,
* must have a spirit of anarchy,
* is a tool for everyday life,
* is not a tradeable commodity,
* must not have been created for purposes of humour alone: humour is merely the by-product
* is not propaganda,
* is not taboo,
* cannot be patented, and
* is without prejudice.

==In the media==
&quot;Chindōgu&quot; and Kawakami were featured regularly on a children&#x27;s television show produced by the BBC called &quot;It&#x27;ll Never Work?&quot;, a show in a similar vein as the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot;; however, &quot;It&#x27;ll Never Work?&quot; usually focused more on wacky, humorous gadgets than on serious scientific and technological advances. 

Kenji Kawakami was visited by Dave Attell during the Sloshed In Translation episode of Insomniac in 2004. Kawakami featured items such as the baby duster, solar flashlight, and a device that would dry your hair with each step you took.

<text>The governor of Florida is the head of government of the U.S. state of Florida. The governor is the head of the executive branch of the government of Florida and is the commander-in-chief of the Florida National Guard.

The current officeholder is Ron DeSantis, a member of the Republican Party who took office on January 8, 2019.

==List of governors==

===Federal military commissioner===

Spanish Florida was acquired from Spain in the Adams–Onís Treaty, which took effect July 10, 1821. Parts of West Florida had already been assigned to Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi; the remainder and East Florida were governed by a military commissioner with the powers of governor until the territory was organized and incorporated.

===Territory of Florida===
Florida Territory was organized on March 30, 1822, combining East and West Florida.

===State of Florida===
The State of Florida was admitted to the Union on March 3, 1845. It seceded from the Union on January 10, 1861, and joined the Confederate States of America on February 8, 1861, as a founding member. Following the end of the American Civil War, it was part of the Third Military District. Florida was readmitted to the Union on June 25, 1868.

The Florida Constitution of 1838 provided that a governor be elected every 4 years, who was not allowed to serve consecutive terms. The secessionist constitution of 1861 would have reduced this to two years and removed the term limit, but the state fell to the Union before the first election under that constitution. The rejected constitution of 1865 and the ratified constitution of 1868 maintained the four-year term, though without the earlier term limit, which was reintroduced in the 1885 constitution. The current constitution of 1968 states that should the governor serve, or would have served had he not resigned, more than six years in two consecutive terms, he cannot be elected to the succeeding term. The start of a term was set in 1885 at the first Tuesday after the first Monday in the January following the election, where it has remained.

Originally, the president of the state senate acted as governor should that office be vacant. The 1865 and 1868 constitutions created the office of lieutenant governor, who would similarly act as governor. This office was abolished in 1885, with the president of the senate again taking on that duty. The 1968 constitution recreated the office of lieutenant governor, who now becomes governor in the absence of the governor. The governor and lieutenant governor are elected on the same ticket.

Florida was a strongly Democratic state before the Civil War, electing only one candidate from the Whig Party (the Democrats&#x27; chief opposition at the time). It elected three Republican governors following Reconstruction, but after the Democratic Party re-established control, 90 years passed before voters chose another Republican. Since 1998, it has been a strongly Republican state.


==Acting governor==
Florida has had a number of people serve as acting governor. The state&#x27;s first three constitutions provided that the succession in office became operative whenever the governor was out of the state. Thus, in 1853 when Governor Thomas Brown attended an event in Boston—the Senate president who would normally succeed the governor at the time was also out of state. Therefore, the Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, A.K. Allison, became acting governor on September 16, 1853. He served for 17 days.

Article IV Section 3 (b) of the Florida Constitution now calls for the lieutenant governor to &quot;act as Governor&quot; during the governor&#x27;s physical or mental incapacity. This provision has been invoked one time. On June 18, 2008, Governor Charlie Crist filed a proclamation with the secretary of state transferring power of governor to Lt. Governor Jeff Kottkamp pursuant to the constitutional provision while he underwent knee surgery.

<text>Gottfried Semper (; 29 November 1803 – 15 May 1879) was a German architect, art critic, and professor of architecture who designed and built the Semper Opera House in Dresden between 1838 and 1841. In 1849 he took part in the May Uprising in Dresden and was put on the government&#x27;s wanted list. He fled first to Zürich and later to London. He returned to Germany after the 1862 amnesty granted to the revolutionaries.

Semper wrote extensively on the origins of architecture, especially in his book &quot;The Four Elements of Architecture&quot; (1851), and was one of the major figures in the controversy surrounding the polychrome architectural style of ancient Greece. He designed works at all scales—from major urban interventions such as the redesign of the Ringstraße in Vienna, to a baton for Richard Wagner. His unrealised design for an opera house in Munich was, without permission, adapted by Wagner for the Bayreuth Festspielhaus.

== Life ==

=== Early life (to 1834) ===
Semper was born into a well-to-do industrialist family in Hamburg in 1803. When French troops occupied the city in 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars, the family moved to nearby Altona, at the time part of Denmark. The fifth of eight children, he attended the Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums in Hamburg before starting his university education at Göttingen in 1823, where he studied historiography and mathematics. He subsequently studied architecture in 1825 at the University of Munich under Friedrich von Gärtner. In 1826, Semper travelled to Paris in order to work for the architect Franz Christian Gau, and he was present when the July Revolution of 1830 broke out. Between 1830 and 1833 he travelled to Italy and Greece in order to study the architecture and designs of antiquity. In 1832, he participated for four months in archaeological research at the Acropolis in Athens.
During this period he became very interested in the Biedermeier-inspired polychromy debate, which centered on the question whether buildings in Ancient Greece and Rome had been colorfully painted or not. The drawn reconstructions of the painterly decorations of ancient villas he created in Athens inspired his later designs for the painted decorations in Dresden and Vienna. His 1834 publication &quot;Vorläufige Bemerkungen über bemalte Architectur und Plastik bei den Alten&quot; (&quot;Preliminary Remarks on Polychrome Architecture and Sculpture in Antiquity&quot;), in which he took a strong position in favor of polychromy - supported by his investigation of pigments on the Trajan&#x27;s column in Rome - brought him sudden recognition in architectural and aesthetic circles across Europe.

=== Dresden period (1834–1849) ===

On September 30, 1834, Semper obtained a post as Professor of Architecture at the Königlichen Akademie der bildenden Künste (today called the Hochschule) in Dresden thanks largely to the efforts and support of his former teacher Franz Christian Gau and swore an oath of allegiance to the King (formerly Elector) of Saxony, Anthony Clement. The flourishing growth of Dresden during this period provided the young architect with considerable creative opportunities. In 1838–1840 a synagogue was built in Dresden to Semper&#x27;s design, it was ever afterward called the Semper Synagogue and is noted for its Moorish Revival interior style. The Synagogue&#x27;s exterior was built in romanesque style so as not to call attention to itself. The interior design included not only the Moorish inspired wall decorations but furnishings: specifically, a silver lamp of eternal light, which caught Richard Wagner and his wife Cosima&#x27;s fancy. They gave a great deal of effort to have a copy of this lamp. Semper&#x27;s student, Otto Simonson would construct the magnificent Moorish Revival Leipzig synagogue in 1855.
Certain civic structures remain today, such as the Elbe-facing gallery of the Zwinger Palace complex. He designed the Dresden Hoftheater in 1841, which burned down in 1869. It was rebuilt in 1878 by his son to Semper&#x27;s plans and today is called the Semperoper. Other buildings also remain indelibly attached to his name, such as the Maternity Hospital, the Synagogue (destroyed during the Third Reich), the Oppenheim Palace, and the &quot;Villa Rosa&quot; built for the banker Martin Wilhelm Oppenheim. This last construction stands as a prototype of German villa architecture.

On September 1, 1835, Semper married Bertha Thimmig. The marriage ultimately produced six children.

A convinced Republican, Semper took a leading role, along with his friend Richard Wagner, in the May 1849 uprising which swept over the city. He was a member of the Civic Guard (Kommunalgarde) and helped to erect barricades in the streets. When the rebellion collapsed, Semper was considered a leading agitator for democratic change and a ringleader against government authority and he was forced to flee the city.

He was destined never to return to the city that would, ironically, become most associated with his architectural (and political) legacy. The Saxon government maintained a warrant for his arrest until 1863. When the Semper-designed Hoftheater burnt down in 1869, King John, on the urging of the citizenry, commissioned Semper to build a new one. Semper produced the plans but left the actual construction to his son, Manfred.

&quot;What must I have done in 48, that one persecutes me forever? One single barricade did I construct - it held, because it was practical, and as it was practical, it was beautiful&quot;, wrote Semper in dismay.

=== Post-revolutionary period (1849–1855) ===
After stays in Zwickau, Hof, Karlsruhe and Strasbourg, Semper eventually ended up back in Paris, like many other disillusioned Republicans from the 1848 Revolutions (such as Heinrich Heine and Ludwig Börne). In the fall of 1850, he travelled to London, England. But while he was able to pick up occasional contracts — including participation in the design of the funeral carriage for the Duke of Wellington and the designs of the Canadian, Danish, Swedish, and Ottoman sections of the 1851 Great Exhibition in the Crystal Palace — he found no steady employment. If his stay in London was disappointing professionally, however, it proved a fertile period for Semper&#x27;s theoretical, creative and academic development. He published &quot;Die vier Elemente der Baukunst&quot; (&quot;The Four Elements of Architecture&quot;) in 1851 and &quot;Wissenschaft, Industrie und Kunst&quot; (&quot;Science, Industry and Art&quot;) in 1852. These works would ultimately provide the groundwork for his most widely regarded publication, &quot;Der Stil in den technischen und tektonischen Künsten oder Praktische Ästhetik,&quot; which was published in two volumes in 1861 and 1863.

=== Zürich period (1855–1871) ===


Concurrently with the onset of the industrial revolution, the Swiss Federation planned to establish a polytechnical school. As the principal judge for the competition held to select a design for the new building, Semper deemed the submitted entries unsatisfactory and, ultimately, designed the building himself. Proudly situated (where fortified walls once stood), visible from all sides on a terrace overlooking the core of Zürich, the new school became a symbol of a new epoch. The building (1853–1864), which despite frequent remodeling continues to evoke Semper&#x27;s concept, was initially required to accommodate not only the new school (known today as the ETH Zurich), but the existing University of Zurich, as well.

In 1855, Semper became a professor of architecture at the new school and the success of many of his students who attained success and renown served to ensure his legacy. The Swiss architect Emil Schmid was one such student. With his income as a professor, Semper was able to reunite his family, bringing them to Zürich from Saxony. The City Hall in Winterthur is among other buildings designed by Semper in Switzerland.

In 1861, Semper and his family were awarded Swiss citizenship by the Swiss municipality of Affoltern am Albis in return for the planning and construction of their main church&#x27;s bell-tower. This citizenship was later confirmed by the Zürich cantonal government in December 1861 and with these new Swiss passports in hand, Semper was once again able to travel and finally also visit Germany, after the warrant for his arrest had been cancelled in May 1863.

Semper provided Bavaria&#x27;s King Ludwig II with a conceptual design for a theatre dedicated to the work of Richard Wagner to be built in Munich. The project, developed from 1864 to 1866, was never realized, although Wagner &#x27;borrowed&#x27; many of its features for his own later theatre at Bayreuth.

=== Later life (from 1871) ===

Already in 1833, there were first plans in Vienna for the public presentation of the Imperial Art Collections. With the planning of the Vienna Ring Road, the museum question became pressing again. Works forming the imperial art collection were scattered among several buildings. Semper was assigned to submit a proposal for locating new buildings in conjunction with redevelopment of the Ring Road. In 1869, he designed a gigantic &#x27;Imperial Forum&#x27; which was not realized. The National Museum of Art History and the National Museum of Natural History were erected, however, opposite the Palace according to his plan, as was the Burgtheater. In 1871, Semper moved to Vienna to undertake the projects.
During construction, repeated disagreements with his appointed associate architect (Karl Freiherr von Hasenauer), led Semper to resign from the project in 1876. In the following year, his health began to deteriorate. He died two years later while on a visit to Italy and is buried in the Protestant Cemetery, Rome.


== Legacy ==

Gottfried Semper&#x27;s legacy in the field of architecture is marked by his profound influence on architectural theory, design, and education, as evidenced by scholarly research and critical analysis.

# Theory of Polychromy: Semper&#x27;s theory of polychromy, emphasizing the use of color in architecture, is well-documented in his own writings, such as &quot;Der Stil in den technischen und tektonischen Künsten&quot; (Style in the Technical and Tectonic Arts), where he discusses the symbolic and aesthetic significance of color in architectural ornamentation. This theory has been studied and cited by architectural historians such as Harry Francis Mallgrave in &quot;Gottfried Semper: Architect of the Nineteenth Century,&quot; where Mallgrave explores Semper&#x27;s theories in depth.
# Material Culture: Semper&#x27;s interest in material culture and its role in architecture is a recurring theme in his works, particularly in &quot;Der Stil.&quot; His ideas on material culture have been analyzed and discussed in various scholarly works, including articles by architectural historians such as Joseph Rykwert, who has examined Semper&#x27;s views on the cultural significance of materials in architecture.
# Elements of Architecture: Semper&#x27;s concept of the four elements of architecture has been discussed in numerous scholarly works on architectural theory and history. For example, in &quot;The Semperian Tradition,&quot; author Joseph Rykwert discusses how Semper&#x27;s elements influenced subsequent architectural thought and practice.
# Architectural Works: Semper&#x27;s architectural works, including the Dresden Semper Opera House, have been extensively studied and documented in architectural histories and monographs. For instance, in &quot;The Architecture of the City,&quot; Aldo Rossi discusses the significance of Semper&#x27;s opera house as a key example of 19th-century architecture.
# Educational Influence: Semper&#x27;s influence on architectural education is evident in the incorporation of his ideas into architectural curricula and pedagogical approaches. This influence has been documented in educational literature on architecture, such as &quot;Architectural Education Today,&quot; edited by Neil Spiller, which discusses the enduring relevance of Semper&#x27;s ideas in contemporary architectural education.

<doc id="76259" wikidata="Q157099" url="?curid=76259" title="Louis the Child">
<text>Louis the Child (893 – 20/24 September 911), sometimes called Louis III or Louis IV, was the king of East Francia from 899 until his death and was also recognized as king of Lotharingia after 900. He was the last East Frankish ruler of the Carolingian dynasty. He succeeded his father, Arnulf, in East Francia and his elder illegitimate half-brother Zwentibold in Lotharingia.

Louis became king when he was six and reigned until his death aged 17 or 18. During his reign the country was ravaged by Magyar raids.

==Life==
Louis was born in September or October 893 in Altötting, Duchy of Bavaria. He was the only legitimate son of king Arnulf of Carinthia and his wife, Ota, a member of the Conradine dynasty. He had at least two brothers: his elder, illegitimate brother Zwentibold, who ruled Lotharingia, and another brother named Ratold, who briefly ruled the Kingdom of Italy. 

===East Francia===
Louis was crowned in Forchheim on 4 February 900. This is the earliest East Frankish royal coronation about which records are known to exist. Louis was of a weak personal constitution, often sick, and due to his young age, the reins of government were entirely in the hands of others – the nobles and bishops. Indeed, the coronation was probably a result of the fact that there was little Louis could gain at the expense of the nobles.

The most influential of Louis&#x27;s councillors were Hatto I and Solomon III (bishop of Constance). It was these two who assured that the royal court decided in favour of the Conradines against the Babenbergers in the matter of the Duchy of Franconia. They appointed Louis&#x27;s nephew, Conrad as a duke. In 903 the Raffelstetten customs regulations were promulgated under Louis&#x27; reign, the first customs regulations in the East Frankish part of Europe.

===Lotharingia===
Louis succeeded Zwentibold in 900. He maintained a separate chancery for East Francia and Lotharingia, the latter under Archbishop Radbod of Trier. He appointed an East Frank, Gebhard, as duke of Lotharingia, alienating the Lotharingian nobility. The latter did not participate in East Frankish assemblies.

===Magyar invasions===
In 900, during the Hungarian invasions of Europe, the Magyar army ravaged Bavaria. Another group of Magyars were defeated by Luitpold, Margrave of Bavaria and Bishop Richer of Passau. In 901 they devastated the Duchy of Carinthia. In 904 Louis invited Kurszán, the kende of the Magyars, to negotiations, but killed him and his delegation. In 906 Magyars twice ravaged the Duchy of Saxony. In 907 they inflicted a heavy defeat on the Bavarians who had invaded Hungary, killing the Margrave Luitpold and many high nobles in the Battle of Pressburg. Next year it was the turn of Saxony and Thuringia, and in 909 that of Alemannia. On their return, however, Arnulf, Duke of Bavaria inflicted a defeat on them on the river Rott, but in 910 they, in their turn, defeated Louis the Child&#x27;s army in the Battle of Augsburg. Louis himself tried to take some military control as he grew older, but he had little success against the Magyars. His army was destroyed at Ennsburg in 907.

===Death and succession===
In a state of despair, possibly afflicted by severe depression, Louis died at Frankfurt am Main on 20 or 24 September 911, seventeen or eighteen years old. Louis was buried in the monastery of Saint Emmeram&#x27;s in Regensburg, where his father Arnulf also lay. His death brought an end to the eastern branch of the Carolingian dynasty.

In 911 the dukes of East Francia elected Conrad of Franconia, son of Gebhard, as the king, while the nobles of Lotharingia elected the Carolingian Charles the Simple, already king of West Francia, as their king.

<doc id="76264" wikidata="Q193493" url="?curid=76264" title="Winamp">
<text>Winamp is a media player for Microsoft Windows originally developed by Justin Frankel and Dmitry Boldyrev by their company Nullsoft, which they later sold to AOL in 1999 for $80 million. It was then acquired by Radionomy in 2014, now known as the Llama Group. Since version 2, it has been sold as freemium and supports extensibility with plug-ins and skins, and features music visualization, playlist and a media library, supported by a large online community.

Version 1 of Winamp was released in 1997, and quickly grew popular with over 3 million downloads, paralleling the developing trend of MP3 file sharing. Winamp 2.0 was released on September 8, 1998. The 2.x versions were widely used and made Winamp one of the most downloaded Windows applications. By 2000, Winamp had over 25 million registered users and by 2001 it had 60 million users. A poor reception to the 2002 rewrite, Winamp3, was followed by the release of Winamp 5 in 2003, and a later release of version 5.5 in 2007. A now-discontinued version for Android was also released, along with early counterparts for MS-DOS and Macintosh.

After a five-year hiatus, Winamp 5.8 (written as Winamp 5.formula_1) was leaked to the public in 2018 before its eventual release by Radionomy; development has since resumed with the latest version 5.9.2 released on April 26, 2023. Its developer Radionomy has since rebranded as Llama Group and launched a streaming service that allows users to support artists by buying perks or NFTs. The service launched on the web in April 2023, followed by beta apps for Android and iOS in July 2023. In September 2024, Llama Group partially released the Winamp source code for Windows under a custom source-available license.

== Features ==
; Playback formats: Winamp supports music playback using MP3, MIDI, MOD, MPEG-1 audio layers 1 and 2, AAC, M4A, FLAC, WAV, and WMA. Winamp was one of the first widely used music players on Windows to support playback of Ogg Vorbis by default. It supports gapless playback for MP3 and AAC and ReplayGain for volume leveling across tracks. CD support includes playing and importing music from audio CDs, optionally with CD-Text, and burning music to CDs. The standard version limits maximum burn speed and datarate; the &quot;Pro&quot; version removes these limitations. Winamp supports playback of Windows Media Video and Nullsoft Streaming Video. For MPEG Video, AVI, and other unsupported video types, Winamp uses Microsoft&#x27;s DirectShow API for playback, allowing playback of most of the video formats supported by Windows Media Player. 5.1 Surround sound is supported where formats and decoders allow.
; Media Library: At installation, Winamp scans the user&#x27;s system for media files to add to the &quot;Media Library&quot; database. It supports full Unicode filenames and Unicode metadata for media files. In the &quot;Media Library&quot; user interface pane, under &quot;Local Media&quot;, several selectors (&quot;Audio&quot;, &quot;Video&quot;, date, and frequency) permit display of subsets of media files with greater detail.
; Adding album art and track tags: &quot;Get Album Art&quot; permits retrieval of cover art, and confirmation before adding the image to the database. &quot;Autotagging&quot; analyzes a track&#x27;s audio using the Gracenote service and retrieves the song&#x27;s ID2 and ID3 metadata.
; Podcatcher: Winamp can also be used as RSS media feeds aggregator capable of displaying articles, downloading, or playing such content as streaming media. SHOUTcast Wire provides a directory and RSS subscription system for podcasts.
; Media player device support: Winamp has extendable support for portable media players and Mass Storage Compliant devices, Microsoft PlaysForSure, and ActiveSync, and syncs unprotected music to the iPod.
; Media Monitor: Winamp &quot;Media Monitor&quot; allows web-based browsing and bookmarking music blog websites and automatically offering for streaming or downloading all MP3 files there. The &quot;Media Monitor&quot; is preloaded with music blog URLs.
; Winamp Remote: &quot;Winamp Remote&quot; allows remote playback (streaming) of unprotected media files on the user&#x27;s PC via the Internet. &quot;Remote&quot; adjusts bitrate based on available bandwidth, and can be controlled by web interface, Wii, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and mobile phones.
; Plug-ins: In February 1998, Winamp was rewritten as a &quot;general-purpose audio player&quot; with a plug-in architecture. This feature was received well by reviewers. Development was early, diverse, and rapid: 66 plugins were published by November 1998. The &quot;Winamp software development kit (SDK)&quot; allows software developers to create seven different types of plug-ins.
:*&quot;Input&quot;: decodes specific file formats.
:*&quot;Output&quot;: sends data to specific devices or files.
:*&quot;Visualization&quot;: provides sound activated graphics.
:*&quot;DSP/Effect&quot;: manipulates audio for special effects.
:*&quot;General Purpose&quot; plug-ins add convenience or UI features (&quot;Media Library&quot;, &quot;alarm clock&quot;, or &quot;pause when logged out&quot;).
:*&quot;Media Library&quot; plug-ins add functions to the Media Library plug-in.
:*&quot;Portables&quot; plug-ins support portable media players.

Plug-in development support increased Winamp&#x27;s flexibility – for example, the creation of specialized plug-ins for game console music files such as NSF, USF, GBS, GSF, SID, VGM, SPC, PSF, and PSF2.

; Skins: Skins are bitmap files that alter the aesthetic design of the Winamp graphical user interface (GUI) and can add functionality with scripting. Winamp published documentation on skin creation in 1998 with the release of Winamp 2 and invited Winamp users to publish skins on Winamp.com. As of 2000, there were nearly 3,000 Winamp skins available. The ability to use skins contributed to Winamp&#x27;s popularity early in MP3 development. With the increasing number of available skins, genres or categories of skins developed, such as &quot;Stereo&quot;, &quot;Anime&quot;, and &quot;Ugly&quot;. Online communities of skin designers such as 1001Skins.com and Skinz.org have contributed thousands of designs; also at GnomeArt. Designers see skins as an opportunity to be creative: nontraditional examples have included Klingon, iPod, and Etch-a-sketch designs. The Winamp skin format is the most popular, the most commonly adopted by other media player software, and is usable across platforms. One example is the XMMS player for Linux and Unix systems, which can use unmodified Winamp 2 skin files. Winamp 5 supports two types of skins – &quot;classic&quot; skins designed to Winamp 2 specifications (static collections of bitmap images), and more flexible, freeform &quot;modern&quot; skins per the Winamp3 specification. Modern skins support true alpha channel transparency, scripting control, a docked toolbar, and other innovations to the user interface.

== History ==

=== Initial releases ===

Winamp was first released in 1997, when Justin Frankel and Dmitry Boldyrev, formerly students at the University of Utah, integrated their Windows user interface with the Advanced Multimedia Products (&quot;AMP&quot;) MP3 file playback engine. The name Winamp (originally spelled WinAMP) was a portmanteau of &quot;Windows&quot; and &quot;AMP&quot;. The minimalist WinAMP 0.20a was released as freeware on April 21, 1997.

Its windowless, menu bar-only interface showed only play (open), stop, pause, and unpause functions. A file specified on the command line or dropped onto its icon would be played. MP3 decoding was performed by the AMP decoding engine developed by Advanced Multimedia Products co-founder Tomislav Uzelac, which was free for non-commercial use. It was compatible with Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0. Winamp was the second real-time MP3 player for Windows, the first being WinPlay3.

WinAMP 0.92 was released as a freeware in May 1997. Within the standard Windows frame and menu bar, it had the beginnings of the &quot;classic&quot; Winamp GUI: dark gray rectangle with silver 3D-effect transport buttons, a red/green volume slider, time displayed in a green LED font, with track name, MP3 bitrate, and &quot;mixrate&quot; in green. Overlength titles appear as slowly scrolling text (or &quot;marquee&quot;). The skeuomorphic design somewhat resembles shelf stereos. There was no position bar, and a blank space where the spectrum analyzer and waveform analyzer would later appear. Multiple files on the command line or dropped onto its icon were enqueued in the playlist.

=== Winamp 1 ===
Version 1.006 was released June 7, 1997, renamed &quot;Winamp&quot;, i.e., with &quot;amp&quot; now in lowercase. It showed a spectrum analyzer and color-changing volume slider, but no waveform display. The AMP non-commercial license was included in its help menu.

According to Tomislav Uzelac, Frankel licensed the AMP 0.7 engine June 1, 1997. Frankel formally founded Nullsoft Inc. in January 1998 and continued development of Winamp, which changed from freeware to $10 shareware. Despite the fact that there would be no extra features by paying $10, Winamp&#x27;s popularity and warm reception brought Nullsoft $100,000 a month that year from $10 paper checks in the mail from paying users.

In March, Brian Litman, managing co-founder with Uzelac of Advanced Multimedia Products, which by then had been merged into PlayMedia Systems, sent a cease-and-desist letter to Nullsoft, claiming unlawful use of AMP. Nullsoft responded that they had replaced AMP with Nitrane, Nullsoft&#x27;s proprietary decoder, but Playmedia disputed this. Third-party reviews found that Nitrane had bugs that resulted in playing back MP3s incorrectly, and that this resulted in unstable tones being added to the playback, and undoubtedly therefore violated the ISO standard. This also means that Nitrane was unlikely to have been based on the AMP software, and was more likely evidence of a hastily written MP3 decoder that didn&#x27;t concern itself with standards compliance.

Version 1.90, released March 31, 1998, was the first release as a general-purpose audio player, and documented on the Winamp website as supporting plugins, of which it included two input plugins (&quot;MOD&quot; and &quot;MP3&quot;) and a visualization plugin.

The installer for Version 1.91, released 18 days later, included &quot;wave&quot;, &quot;cdda&quot;, and &quot;Windows tray handling&quot; plugins, as well as the famous Wesley Willis-inspired DEMO.MP3 file &quot;Winamp, it really whips the llama&#x27;s ass&quot;. &quot;Mike the Llama&quot; is the company mascot.

By July 1998, Winamp&#x27;s various versions had been downloaded over three million times.

=== Winamp 2 ===
Winamp 2.0 was released on September 8, 1998. The new version improved the usability of the playlist, made the equalizer more accurate, and introduced more plug-ins. The modular windows for playlist and equalizer now matched the player&#x27;s skin and could be moved around and be separated or &quot;docked&quot; to each other anywhere in any order.

The 2.x versions were widely used and made Winamp one of the most downloaded pieces of software for Windows. By the end of 1998, there were already over 60 plugins and hundreds of skins made for the software.

PlayMedia filed a federal lawsuit against Nullsoft in March 1999. In May 1999, PlayMedia was granted an injunction by Federal Judge A. Howard Matz against distribution of Nitrane by Nullsoft, and the same month the lawsuit was settled out-of-court with licensing and confidentiality agreements. Soon after, Nullsoft switched to an ISO decoder from the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, the developers of the MP3 format.

Winamp 2.10, released March 24, 1999, included a new version of the &quot;Llama&quot; &quot;demo.mp3&quot; featuring a musical sting and bleating.

Nullsoft was purchased by AOL in June 1999 for $80 million in stock, with Nullsoft becoming a subsidiary. AOL itself merged with Time Warner in 2000.

Nullsoft relaunched the Winamp-specific winamp.com in December 1999 to provide easier access to skins, plug-ins, streaming audio, song downloads, forums, and developer resources.

As of June 22, 2000, Winamp surpassed 25 million registrants.

=== Winamp3 ===
The next major Winamp version, Winamp3 (so spelled to include &quot;mp3&quot; in the name and to mark its separation from the Winamp 2 codebase), was released on August 9, 2002. It was a complete rewrite of version 2, newly based on the Wasabi application framework, which offered additional functionality and flexibility. Winamp3 was developed parallel to Winamp 2, but &quot;many users found it consumed too many system resources and was unstable (or even lacked some valued functionality, such as the ability to count or find the total duration of tracks in a playlist)&quot;. Winamp3 had no backward compatibility with Winamp 2 plugins, and the SHOUTcast sourcing plugin was not supported. No Winamp3 version of SHOUTcast was ever released.

In response to users reverting to Winamp 2, Nullsoft continued the development of Winamp 2 to versions 2.9 and 2.91 in 2003, even alluding to it humorously. The beta versions 2.92 and 2.95 were released with the inclusion of some of the functionality of the upcoming Winamp 5. During this period the Wasabi cross-platform application framework and skinnable GUI toolkit was derived from parts of the Winamp3 source code. For Linux, Nullsoft released an alpha version of Winamp3 on October 9, 2001, but has not updated it despite continued user interest.

During this time Winamp faced stiff competition from Apple&#x27;s iTunes.

=== Winamp 5 ===
Winamp 5 was based on the Winamp 2 codebase, but with Winamp3 features such as modern skins incorporated via a plugin, thus incorporating the main advantages of both products. Regarding the omission of a version 4, Nullsoft joked that &quot;nobody wants to see a Winamp 4 skin&quot; (&quot;4 skin&quot; being a pun on foreskin). It was also joked that &quot;Winamp 5 is so good they skipped a number&quot; and &quot;Winamp 2+3=5,&quot;. Winamp 5.0 was released in December 2003. A blue themed &quot;Modern&quot; skin became the default interface. The media library was improved, CD burning and ripping was introduced, and other additions.

The original Nullsoft team quit in 2004. As of version 5.1, Winamp development is credited to Ben Allison (Benski) and Maksim Tyrtyshny.

From version 5.2 onwards, support for synchronizing with an iPod and other portable music players is built-in. This was developed by Will Fisher, as a re-write of the open source ml_ipod plug-in.

==== Winamp 5.5 ====
Winamp 5.5: The 10th Anniversary Edition was released on October 10, 2007, ten years after the first release of Winamp (a preview version had been released on September 10, 2007). New features to the player included album art support, improved localization support (with several officially localized Winamp releases, including German, Polish, Russian, and French), and a new default interface skin called &quot;Bento&quot; which unlike the previous skins is a unified player and media library in one window as opposed to a multi-window interface. This version dropped support for Windows 9x.

==== Winamp 5.6 ====
Winamp 5.6 was released in November 2010 and features Android Wi-Fi support and direct mouse wheel support. Fraunhofer AAC codec with VBR encoding support was implemented. Moreover, the option to write ratings to tags (for MP3, WMA/WMV, Ogg, and FLAC) was added. Hungarian and Indonesian installer translations and language packs were added.

With the release of Winamp version 5.66 on November 20, 2013, AOL announced that Winamp.com would shut down on December 20, 2013, and Winamp would cease to be offered for download after that date.

Five days later, version 5.666 was released with the &quot;Pro&quot; and &quot;Full&quot; installers being one and the same, in the process removing OpenCandy, Emusic, AOL Search, and AOL Toolbar from the installation bundle. This was announced to be the last release of Winamp from AOL/Nullsoft.

==== Winamp 5.7 ====
There was a Winamp 5.7 beta program for an invitation-based Winamp Cloud feature, which would let Winamp play a user&#x27;s entire cloud-stored music library across all supported devices. This feature would have allowed AOL to provide a music locker service that would essentially compete with other online music lockers. The beta program was cancelled months before the announcement to shut down the Winamp project.

=== Acquisition by Radionomy ===
On November 20, 2013, AOL announced that it would shut down Winamp.com on December 20, 2013, and the software would no longer be available for download nor supported by the company after that date. The following day, an unofficial report surfaced that Microsoft was in talks with AOL to acquire Nullsoft. Despite AOL&#x27;s announcement, the Winamp site was not shut down as planned, and on January 14, 2014, it was officially announced that Belgian online radio aggregator Radionomy had bought the Nullsoft brand, which includes Winamp and SHOUTcast. No financial details were publicly announced. However, TechCrunch has reported that the sale of Winamp and Shoutcast is worth between $5 and $10 million, with AOL taking a 12% stake (a financial, not strategic, investment) in Radionomy in the process.

Radionomy relaunched the Winamp website, and it was available for download again. In December 2015, Vivendi bought a majority stake in Radionomy.

Following Radionomy&#x27;s acquisition, no new releases would officially surface until Winamp 5.8 in 2018.

==== Winamp 5.8 ====
In September 2018, it was reported that a Winamp 5.8 beta build 3563 was leaked to various file-sharing sites. The leaked build, bearing a build date of October 26, 2016, would be the first public build under Radionomy&#x27;s umbrella, with changes including compatibility with Windows 8.1, 10 and 11, and the removal of the paid Winamp Pro.

Following the leak, Radionomy officially released Winamp 5.8 build 3660 on October 18, 2018.

==== Winamp 5.9 ====
Winamp 5.9 was released on September 9, 2022, with mostly under-the-hood improvements. The development team migrated the project from Visual Studio 2008 to Visual Studio 2019, in addition to improving support for Windows 11, high-resolution audio, and playback of HTTPS streams. The minimum supported operating system was increased to Windows 7 SP1.

On December 6, 2022, Winamp 5.9.1 was released, adding a music NFT playback feature. Users are able to add music NFTs on Ethereum and Polygon to the media library by connecting to the Metamask wallet.

In April 2023, Winamp 5.9.2 was officially released, which, according to the developers themselves, is a minor update to the previous version.

=== Winamp service ===
On October 15, 2018, Radionomy&#x27;s CEO Alexandre Saboundjian announced that a new version of Winamp – then called Winamp 6 – would be released in 2019. The new version launched on April 13, 2023 as an online service. The platform features Winamp Player, a music streaming service with plans to integrate with other music platforms such as Spotify and to play local audio files. Another feature of the new platform is Winamp Fanzone, where artists can upload and license their music for commercial use, and listeners can support artists directly by buying perks, such as early access to new songs or NFTs.

== Source code release ==
On May 16, 2024, Llama Group announced that Winamp would be going partially open source on September 24, 2024. The source code was released in a GitHub repository under the &quot;Winamp Collaborative License&quot;, a license restricting the ability to create forks or distribute modified binaries (which is not considered free or open source) and requires waiving ownership of contributions to Llama Group.

After the source code was released, multiple pieces of proprietary source code were found: the entirety of the SHOUTcast server software, as well as code from Microsoft, Dolby and Intel. After &quot;The Register&quot; contacted the Llama Group about the code on October 15, 2024, the GitHub repository was deleted.

== On other platforms ==

=== Android ===
&quot;Winamp for Android&quot; is a mobile version for the Android (version 2.1) operating system, released in beta in October 2010 with a stable release in December 2010. It includes syncing with Winamp desktop (ver. 5.59 beta+) over USB or Wi-Fi. It was received with some enthusiasm in the consumer blog press. The app was removed from the Play Store in 2014 due to a combination of factors, including a decline in user interest and the cessation of support from its parent company, AOL.

It was reported in 2018 by TechCrunch that a redesigned Android app was planned alongside the announcement of the development of Winamp 6.

An app for the Winamp service was released in beta for Android in July 2023.

=== Macintosh ===
In 1997, Nullsoft also released MacAmp, an Apple Macintosh equivalent of Winamp.

In October 2011, &quot;Winamp Sync for Mac&quot; was introduced as a beta release. It is the first Winamp version for the Mac OS X platform and runs under version 10.6 and above. Its focus is on syncing the Winamp Library to Winamp for Android and the iTunes Music Library (hence the name, &quot;Winamp Sync for Mac&quot;). Nonetheless, a full Winamp Library and player features are included. The developer&#x27;s blog stated that the &quot;Winamp Sync for Mac Beta&quot; would pave the way for future Winamp-related development on Mac and a fully featured media player as Winamp on Windows. However no further development occurred.

=== Linux ===
An early alpha preview of Winamp3 for desktop Linux was developed in October 2001, but support was dropped not long after. Nonetheless some versions of Winamp for Windows are functional using Wine.

=== MS-DOS ===
DOSamp for MS-DOS operating systems was released in 1997. The software was soon abandoned by Nullsoft to focus on the Windows version (Winamp).

=== iOS ===
In July 2023, a beta version of a Winamp service was released via TestFlight for the iOS mobile platform.

== Easter eggs ==
Winamp has historically included a number of Easter eggs: hidden features that are accessible via undocumented operations. One example is an image of Justin Frankel, one of Winamp&#x27;s original authors, hidden in Winamp&#x27;s About dialog box. The included Easter eggs have changed with versions of Winamp, and over thirty have been documented elsewhere.

== Derivative works ==
&quot;Unagi&quot; is the codename for the media playback engine derived from Winamp core technologies. AOL announced in 2004 that Unagi would be incorporated into &quot;AOL Media Player (AMP)&quot;, in development. After beta testing, &quot;AMP&quot; was discontinued in 2005, but portions lived on in AOL&#x27;s Web-based player.

XMMS, xmms2, qmmp and Audacious are free and open source music players created as clones of Winamp. Some of these even support skins and plug-ins designed for Winamp.

An HTML5 and JavaScript-based web player resembling the graphical user interface of Winamp 2 was developed by programmer Jordan Eldredge in 2018.
