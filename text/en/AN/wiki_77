<text>A mathematical proof is a deductive argument for a mathematical statement, showing that the stated assumptions logically guarantee the conclusion. The argument may use other previously established statements, such as theorems; but every proof can, in principle, be constructed using only certain basic or original assumptions known as axioms, along with the accepted rules of inference. Proofs are examples of exhaustive deductive reasoning that establish logical certainty, to be distinguished from empirical arguments or non-exhaustive inductive reasoning that establish &quot;reasonable expectation&quot;. Presenting many cases in which the statement holds is not enough for a proof, which must demonstrate that the statement is true in &quot;all&quot; possible cases. A proposition that has not been proved but is believed to be true is known as a conjecture, or a hypothesis if frequently used as an assumption for further mathematical work.

Proofs employ logic expressed in mathematical symbols, along with natural language that usually admits some ambiguity. In most mathematical literature, proofs are written in terms of rigorous informal logic. Purely formal proofs, written fully in symbolic language without the involvement of natural language, are considered in proof theory. The distinction between formal and informal proofs has led to much examination of current and historical mathematical practice, quasi-empiricism in mathematics, and so-called folk mathematics, oral traditions in the mainstream mathematical community or in other cultures. The philosophy of mathematics is concerned with the role of language and logic in proofs, and mathematics as a language.

==History and etymology==
The word &quot;proof&quot; derives from the Latin &#x27;to test&#x27;; related words include English &quot;probe&quot;, &quot;probation&quot;, and &quot;probability&quot;, as well as Spanish &#x27;to taste&#x27; (sometimes &#x27;to touch&#x27; or &#x27;to test&#x27;), Italian &#x27;to try&#x27;, and German &#x27;to try&#x27;. The legal term &quot;probity&quot; means authority or credibility, the power of testimony to prove facts when given by persons of reputation or status.

Plausibility arguments using heuristic devices such as pictures and analogies preceded strict mathematical proof. It is likely that the idea of demonstrating a conclusion first arose in connection with geometry, which originated in practical problems of land measurement. The development of mathematical proof is primarily the product of ancient Greek mathematics, and one of its greatest achievements. Thales (624–546 BCE) and Hippocrates of Chios (c. 470–410 BCE) gave some of the first known proofs of theorems in geometry. Eudoxus (408–355 BCE) and Theaetetus (417–369 BCE) formulated theorems but did not prove them. Aristotle (384–322 BCE) said definitions should describe the concept being defined in terms of other concepts already known.

Mathematical proof was revolutionized by Euclid (300 BCE), who introduced the axiomatic method still in use today. It starts with undefined terms and axioms, propositions concerning the undefined terms which are assumed to be self-evidently true (from Greek &#x27;something worthy&#x27;). From this basis, the method proves theorems using deductive logic. &quot;Euclid&#x27;s Elements&quot; was read by anyone who was considered educated in the West until the middle of the 20th century. In addition to theorems of geometry, such as the Pythagorean theorem, the &quot;Elements&quot; also covers number theory, including a proof that the square root of two is irrational and a proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers.

Further advances also took place in medieval Islamic mathematics. In the 10th century, the Iraqi mathematician Al-Hashimi worked with numbers as such, called &quot;lines&quot; but not necessarily considered as measurements of geometric objects, to prove algebraic propositions concerning multiplication, division, etc., including the existence of irrational numbers. An inductive proof for arithmetic progressions was introduced in the &quot;Al-Fakhri&quot; (1000) by Al-Karaji, who used it to prove the binomial theorem and properties of Pascal&#x27;s triangle.

Modern proof theory treats proofs as inductively defined data structures, not requiring an assumption that axioms are &quot;true&quot; in any sense. This allows parallel mathematical theories as formal models of a given intuitive concept, based on alternate sets of axioms, for example axiomatic set theory and non-Euclidean geometry.

==Nature and purpose==

As practiced, a proof is expressed in natural language and is a rigorous argument intended to convince the audience of the truth of a statement. The standard of rigor is not absolute and has varied throughout history. A proof can be presented differently depending on the intended audience. To gain acceptance, a proof has to meet communal standards of rigor; an argument considered vague or incomplete may be rejected.

The concept of proof is formalized in the field of mathematical logic. A formal proof is written in a formal language instead of natural language. A formal proof is a sequence of formulas in a formal language, starting with an assumption, and with each subsequent formula a logical consequence of the preceding ones. This definition makes the concept of proof amenable to study. Indeed, the field of proof theory studies formal proofs and their properties, the most famous and surprising being that almost all axiomatic systems can generate certain undecidable statements not provable within the system.

The definition of a formal proof is intended to capture the concept of proofs as written in the practice of mathematics. The soundness of this definition amounts to the belief that a published proof can, in principle, be converted into a formal proof. However, outside the field of automated proof assistants, this is rarely done in practice. A classic question in philosophy asks whether mathematical proofs are analytic or synthetic. Kant, who introduced the analytic–synthetic distinction, believed mathematical proofs are synthetic, whereas Quine argued in his 1951 &quot;Two Dogmas of Empiricism&quot; that such a distinction is untenable.

Proofs may be admired for their mathematical beauty. The mathematician Paul Erdős was known for describing proofs which he found to be particularly elegant as coming from &quot;The Book&quot;, a hypothetical tome containing the most beautiful method(s) of proving each theorem. The book &quot;Proofs from THE BOOK&quot;, published in 2003, is devoted to presenting 32 proofs its editors find particularly pleasing.

==Methods of proof==

===Direct proof===
In direct proof, the conclusion is established by logically combining the axioms, definitions, and earlier theorems. For example, direct proof can be used to prove that the sum of two even integers is always even:

:Consider two even integers &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;. Since they are even, they can be written as &quot;x&quot; = 2&quot;a&quot; and &quot;y&quot; = 2&quot;b&quot;, respectively, for some integers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;. Then the sum is &quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot; = 2&quot;a&quot; + 2&quot;b&quot; = 2(&quot;a&quot;+&quot;b&quot;). Therefore &quot;x&quot;+&quot;y&quot; has 2 as a factor and, by definition, is even. Hence, the sum of any two even integers is even.

This proof uses the definition of even integers, the integer properties of closure under addition and multiplication, and the distributive property.

===Proof by mathematical induction===

Despite its name, mathematical induction is a method of deduction, not a form of inductive reasoning. In proof by mathematical induction, a single &quot;base case&quot; is proved, and an &quot;induction rule&quot; is proved that establishes that any arbitrary case implies the next case. Since in principle the induction rule can be applied repeatedly (starting from the proved base case), it follows that all (usually infinitely many) cases are provable. This avoids having to prove each case individually. A variant of mathematical induction is proof by infinite descent, which can be used, for example, to prove the irrationality of the square root of two.

A common application of proof by mathematical induction is to prove that a property known to hold for one number holds for all natural numbers:
Let } be the set of natural numbers, and let be a mathematical statement involving the natural number belonging to such that
* (i) is true, i.e., is true for .
* (ii) is true whenever is true, i.e., is true implies that is true.
* Then is true for all natural numbers .

For example, we can prove by induction that all positive integers of the form are odd. Let represent &quot; is odd&quot;:
:(i) For , , and is odd, since it leaves a remainder of when divided by . Thus is true.
:(ii) For any , if is odd (), then must also be odd, because adding to an odd number results in an odd number. But , so is odd (). So implies .
:Thus is odd, for all positive integers .

The shorter phrase &quot;proof by induction&quot; is often used instead of &quot;proof by mathematical induction&quot;.

===Proof by contraposition===

Proof by contraposition infers the statement &quot;if &quot;p&quot; then &quot;q&quot;&quot; by establishing the logically equivalent contrapositive statement: &quot;if &quot;not q&quot; then &quot;not p&quot;&quot;.

For example, contraposition can be used to establish that, given an integer formula_1, if formula_2 is even, then formula_1 is even:

: Suppose formula_1 is not even. Then formula_1 is odd. The product of two odd numbers is odd, hence formula_6 is odd. Thus formula_2 is not even. Thus, if formula_2 &quot;is&quot; even, the supposition must be false, so formula_9 has to be even.

===Proof by contradiction===

In proof by contradiction, also known by the Latin phrase &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot; (by reduction to the absurd), it is shown that if some statement is assumed true, a logical contradiction occurs, hence the statement must be false. A famous example involves the proof that formula_10 is an irrational number:

:Suppose that formula_10 were a rational number. Then it could be written in lowest terms as formula_12 where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are non-zero integers with no common factor. Thus, formula_13. Squaring both sides yields 2&quot;b&quot;2 = &quot;a&quot;2. Since the expression on the left is an integer multiple of 2, the right expression is by definition divisible by 2. That is, &quot;a&quot;2 is even, which implies that &quot;a&quot; must also be even, as seen in the proposition above (in #Proof by contraposition). So we can write &quot;a&quot; = 2&quot;c&quot;, where &quot;c&quot; is also an integer. Substitution into the original equation yields 2&quot;b&quot;2 = (2&quot;c&quot;)2 = 4&quot;c&quot;2. Dividing both sides by 2 yields &quot;b&quot;2 = 2&quot;c&quot;2. But then, by the same argument as before, 2 divides &quot;b&quot;2, so &quot;b&quot; must be even. However, if &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are both even, they have 2 as a common factor. This contradicts our previous statement that &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; have no common factor, so we must conclude that formula_10 is an irrational number.

To paraphrase: if one could write formula_10 as a fraction, this fraction could never be written in lowest terms, since 2 could always be factored from numerator and denominator.

===Proof by construction===

Proof by construction, or proof by example, is the construction of a concrete example with a property to show that something having that property exists. Joseph Liouville, for instance, proved the existence of transcendental numbers by constructing an explicit example. It can also be used to construct a counterexample to disprove a proposition that all elements have a certain property.

===Proof by exhaustion===

In proof by exhaustion, the conclusion is established by dividing it into a finite number of cases and proving each one separately. The number of cases sometimes can become very large. For example, the first proof of the four color theorem was a proof by exhaustion with 1,936 cases. This proof was controversial because the majority of the cases were checked by a computer program, not by hand.

=== Closed chain inference ===
A closed chain inference shows that a collection of statements are pairwise equivalent.

In order to prove that the statements formula_16 are each pairwise equivalent, proofs are given for the implications formula_17, formula_18, formula_19, formula_20 and formula_21.

The pairwise equivalence of the statements then results from the transitivity of the material conditional.

===Probabilistic proof===

A probabilistic proof is one in which an example is shown to exist, with certainty, by using methods of probability theory. Probabilistic proof, like proof by construction, is one of many ways to prove existence theorems.

In the probabilistic method, one seeks an object having a given property, starting with a large set of candidates. One assigns a certain probability for each candidate to be chosen, and then proves that there is a non-zero probability that a chosen candidate will have the desired property. This does not specify which candidates have the property, but the probability could not be positive without at least one.

A probabilistic proof is not to be confused with an argument that a theorem is &#x27;probably&#x27; true, a &#x27;plausibility argument&#x27;. The work toward the Collatz conjecture shows how far plausibility is from genuine proof, as does the disproof of the Mertens conjecture. While most mathematicians do not think that probabilistic evidence for the properties of a given object counts as a genuine mathematical proof, a few mathematicians and philosophers have argued that at least some types of probabilistic evidence (such as Rabin&#x27;s probabilistic algorithm for testing primality) are as good as genuine mathematical proofs.

===Combinatorial proof===

A combinatorial proof establishes the equivalence of different expressions by showing that they count the same object in different ways. Often a bijection between two sets is used to show that the expressions for their two sizes are equal. Alternatively, a double counting argument provides two different expressions for the size of a single set, again showing that the two expressions are equal.

===Nonconstructive proof===

A nonconstructive proof establishes that a mathematical object with a certain property exists—without explaining how such an object can be found. Often, this takes the form of a proof by contradiction in which the nonexistence of the object is proved to be impossible. In contrast, a constructive proof establishes that a particular object exists by providing a method of finding it. The following famous example of a nonconstructive proof shows that there exist two irrational numbers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; such that formula_22 is a rational number. This proof uses that formula_10 is irrational (an easy proof is known since Euclid), but not that formula_24 is irrational (this is true, but the proof is not elementary).
:Either formula_24 is a rational number and we are done (take formula_26), or formula_24 is irrational so we can write formula_28 and formula_29. This then gives formula_30, which is thus a rational number of the form formula_31

===Statistical proofs in pure mathematics===

The expression &quot;statistical proof&quot; may be used technically or colloquially in areas of pure mathematics, such as involving cryptography, chaotic series, and probabilistic number theory or analytic number theory. It is less commonly used to refer to a mathematical proof in the branch of mathematics known as mathematical statistics. See also the &quot;Statistical proof using data&quot; section below.

===Computer-assisted proofs===

Until the twentieth century it was assumed that any proof could, in principle, be checked by a competent mathematician to confirm its validity. However, computers are now used both to prove theorems and to carry out calculations that are too long for any human or team of humans to check; the first proof of the four color theorem is an example of a computer-assisted proof. Some mathematicians are concerned that the possibility of an error in a computer program or a run-time error in its calculations calls the validity of such computer-assisted proofs into question. In practice, the chances of an error invalidating a computer-assisted proof can be reduced by incorporating redundancy and self-checks into calculations, and by developing multiple independent approaches and programs. Errors can never be completely ruled out in case of verification of a proof by humans either, especially if the proof contains natural language and requires deep mathematical insight to uncover the potential hidden assumptions and fallacies involved.

==Undecidable statements==
A statement that is neither provable nor disprovable from a set of axioms is called undecidable (from those axioms). One example is the parallel postulate, which is neither provable nor refutable from the remaining axioms of Euclidean geometry.

Mathematicians have shown there are many statements that are neither provable nor disprovable in Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC), the standard system of set theory in mathematics (assuming that ZFC is consistent); see List of statements undecidable in ZFC.

Gödel&#x27;s (first) incompleteness theorem shows that many axiom systems of mathematical interest will have undecidable statements.

==Heuristic mathematics and experimental mathematics==

While early mathematicians such as Eudoxus of Cnidus did not use proofs, from Euclid to the foundational mathematics developments of the late 19th and 20th centuries, proofs were an essential part of mathematics. With the increase in computing power in the 1960s, significant work began to be done investigating mathematical objects beyond the proof-theorem framework, in experimental mathematics. Early pioneers of these methods intended the work ultimately to be resolved into a classical proof-theorem framework, e.g. the early development of fractal geometry, which was ultimately so resolved.

==Related concepts==

===Visual proof===
Although not a formal proof, a visual demonstration of a mathematical theorem is sometimes called a &quot;proof without words&quot;. The left-hand picture below is an example of a historic visual proof of the Pythagorean theorem in the case of the (3,4,5) triangle.
Some illusory visual proofs, such as the missing square puzzle, can be constructed in a way which appear to prove a supposed mathematical fact but only do so by neglecting tiny errors (for example, supposedly straight lines which actually bend slightly) which are unnoticeable until the entire picture is closely examined, with lengths and angles precisely measured or calculated.

===Elementary proof===

An elementary proof is a proof which only uses basic techniques. More specifically, the term is used in number theory to refer to proofs that make no use of complex analysis. For some time it was thought that certain theorems, like the prime number theorem, could only be proved using &quot;higher&quot; mathematics. However, over time, many of these results have been reproved using only elementary techniques.

===Two-column proof===
A particular way of organising a proof using two parallel columns is often used as a mathematical exercise in elementary geometry classes in the United States. The proof is written as a series of lines in two columns. In each line, the left-hand column contains a proposition, while the right-hand column contains a brief explanation of how the corresponding proposition in the left-hand column is either an axiom, a hypothesis, or can be logically derived from previous propositions. The left-hand column is typically headed &quot;Statements&quot; and the right-hand column is typically headed &quot;Reasons&quot;.

===Colloquial use of &quot;mathematical proof&quot;===
The expression &quot;mathematical proof&quot; is used by lay people to refer to using mathematical methods or arguing with mathematical objects, such as numbers, to demonstrate something about everyday life, or when data used in an argument is numerical. It is sometimes also used to mean a &quot;statistical proof&quot; (below), especially when used to argue from data.

===Statistical proof using data===

&quot;Statistical proof&quot; from data refers to the application of statistics, data analysis, or Bayesian analysis to infer propositions regarding the probability of data. While &quot;using&quot; mathematical proof to establish theorems in statistics, it is usually not a mathematical proof in that the &quot;assumptions&quot; from which probability statements are derived require empirical evidence from outside mathematics to verify. In physics, in addition to statistical methods, &quot;statistical proof&quot; can refer to the specialized &quot;mathematical methods of physics&quot; applied to analyze data in a particle physics experiment or observational study in physical cosmology. &quot;Statistical proof&quot; may also refer to raw data or a convincing diagram involving data, such as scatter plots, when the data or diagram is adequately convincing without further analysis.

===Inductive logic proofs and Bayesian analysis===

Proofs using inductive logic, while considered mathematical in nature, seek to establish propositions with a degree of certainty, which acts in a similar manner to probability, and may be less than full certainty. Inductive logic should not be confused with mathematical induction.

Bayesian analysis uses Bayes&#x27; theorem to update a person&#x27;s assessment of likelihoods of hypotheses when new evidence or information is acquired.

===Proofs as mental objects===

Psychologism views mathematical proofs as psychological or mental objects. Mathematician philosophers, such as Leibniz, Frege, and Carnap have variously criticized this view and attempted to develop a semantics for what they considered to be the language of thought, whereby standards of mathematical proof might be applied to empirical science.

===Influence of mathematical proof methods outside mathematics===
Philosopher-mathematicians such as Spinoza have attempted to formulate philosophical arguments in an axiomatic manner, whereby mathematical proof standards could be applied to argumentation in general philosophy. Other mathematician-philosophers have tried to use standards of mathematical proof and reason, without empiricism, to arrive at statements outside of mathematics, but having the certainty of propositions deduced in a mathematical proof, such as Descartes&#x27; &quot;cogito&quot; argument.

==Ending a proof==

Sometimes, the abbreviation &quot;Q.E.D.&quot; is written to indicate the end of a proof. This abbreviation stands for &quot;quod erat demonstrandum&quot;, which is Latin for &quot;that which was to be demonstrated&quot;. A more common alternative is to use a square or a rectangle, such as □ or ∎, known as a &quot;tombstone&quot; or &quot;halmos&quot; after its eponym Paul Halmos. Often, &quot;which was to be shown&quot; is verbally stated when writing &quot;QED&quot;, &quot;□&quot;, or &quot;∎&quot; during an oral presentation. Unicode explicitly provides the &quot;end of proof&quot; character, U+220E (∎) .

<text>Cat&#x27;s Cradle is a satirical postmodern novel, with science fiction elements, by American writer Kurt Vonnegut. Vonnegut&#x27;s fourth novel, it was first published on March 18, 1963, exploring and satirizing issues of science, technology, the purpose of religion, and the arms race, often through the use of morbid humor.

==Synopsis==
===Background===
The first-person everyman narrator, a professional writer introducing himself as Jonah (but apparently named John and never named again), frames the plot as a flashback. Set in the mid-20th century, the plot revolves around a time when he was planning to write a book called &quot;The Day the World Ended&quot; about what people were doing on the day of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. Throughout, he also intersperses meaningful as well as sarcastic passages and sentiments from an odd religious scripture known as &quot;The Books of Bokonon&quot;. Most of the events of the novel occur before the narrator was converted to his current religion, Bokononism.

===Plot summary===
While researching for his upcoming book, the narrator wrote a letter to Newt Hoenikker, the younger son of the late Felix Hoenikker, a co-creator of the atomic bomb and Nobel laureate physicist, asking him to describe what he remembers about the day when the first bomb was dropped. Newt recounts that his father was doing nothing more than playing the string game &quot;cat&#x27;s cradle&quot;. About a year later, He travels to Ilium, New York to interview Hoenikker&#x27;s coworkers, and other acquaintances. There, he learns of a substance called &quot;ice-nine&quot;, conceptualised for military use by Hoenikker, and without the narrator&#x27;s knowledge, is in the possession of his three adult children. &quot;Ice-nine&quot; is an alternative structure of water that is solid at room temperature and acts as a seed crystal upon contact with ordinary liquid water, causing that liquid water to instantly freeze and transform into more &quot;ice-nine&quot;.

Eventually, a magazine assignment takes the narrator to the (fictional) Caribbean island of San Lorenzo, one of the poorest countries on Earth. On the plane ride, the narrator is surprised to meet Newt and Angela, Felix&#x27;s only daughter. He also meets the newly appointed US ambassador to San Lorenzo, who provides a comprehensive guidebook on San Lorenzo&#x27;s unusual culture and history. The guidebook describes a locally influential semi-parody religious movement called Bokononism, which combines irreverent, nihilistic, and cynical observations about life and God&#x27;s will; an emphasis on coincidences and serendipity; and both thoughtful and humorous sayings and rituals into a holy text called &quot;The Books of Bokonon&quot;. Bokonon, the religion&#x27;s founder, was a former leader of the island who created Bokononism as part of a utopian project to give people purpose and community in the face of the island&#x27;s unsolvable poverty and squalor. As a deliberate attempt to give Bokononism an alluring sense of forbidden glamor and hope, the religion is nominally outlawed, which forced Bokonon to live in &quot;hiding&quot; in the jungle. The current dictator, &quot;Papa&quot; Monzano, threatens all Bokononists with impalement on a large hook. Intrigued by Bokononism, the narrator later discovers the strange reality that nearly all residents of San Lorenzo, even including &quot;Papa&quot; Monzano himself, practice it in secret, and punishment by the hook is, in actuality, quite rare.

On San Lorenzo, the plane passengers are greeted by &quot;Papa&quot; Monzano, his beautiful adopted daughter Mona (whom the narrator intensely lusts after), and a crowd of some five thousand San Lorenzans. Monzano is ill from cancer and wants his successor to be Frank Hoenikker: Monzano&#x27;s personal bodyguard and, coincidentally, Felix Hoenikker&#x27;s other son. Frank achieved this position by giving &quot;Papa&quot; Monzano a piece of &quot;ice-nine&quot;. However, Frank, uncomfortable with leading, confronts the narrator in private and somewhat randomly offers him the presidency. Startled at first, the narrator grudgingly accepts after he is promised the beautiful Mona for his bride. Newt reiterates the idea of the cat&#x27;s cradle, implying that the game, with its invisible cat, is an appropriate symbol for nonsense and the meaninglessness of life. Soon after, the bedridden &quot;Papa&quot; Monzano commits suicide by swallowing &quot;ice-nine&quot;, whereupon his corpse instantly turns into solid &quot;ice-nine&quot;. Frank Hoenikker admits to giving Monzano &quot;ice-nine&quot;, and the Hoenikkers explain that when they were young their father would give them hints about the existence of &quot;ice-nine&quot; while experimenting with it in the kitchen. After their father&#x27;s death, they gathered chunks of the substance into thermos flasks and have kept them ever since.

Festivities for the narrator&#x27;s presidential inauguration begin, but during an air show performed by San Lorenzo&#x27;s fighter planes, one of the planes malfunctions and crashes into the seaside palace, causing Monzano&#x27;s still-frozen body to fall into the sea. Instantly, all the water in the world&#x27;s seas, rivers, and groundwater transforms into solid &quot;ice-nine&quot;. The freezing of the world&#x27;s oceans immediately causes violent tornadoes to ravage the Earth, but the narrator manages to escape with Mona to a secret bunker beneath the palace. When the initial storms subside after several days, they emerge. Exploring the island for survivors, they discover a mass grave where all the surviving San Lorenzans committed suicide by touching &quot;ice-nine&quot; from the landscape to their mouths on the facetious advice of Bokonon, who has left a note of explanation. Displaying a mix of grief for her people and resigned amusement, Mona promptly follows suit and dies.

The horrified narrator is discovered by a few other survivors, including Newt and Frank Hoenikker, and he lives with them in a cave for several months, during which time he writes the contents of the book. Driving through the barren wasteland one day, he spots Bokonon himself, who is contemplating what the last words of &quot;The Books of Bokonon&quot; should be. Bokonon states that if he were younger, he would place a book about human stupidity on the peak of San Lorenzo&#x27;s highest mountain, rest his head on it, swallow &quot;ice-nine&quot;, and die while thumbing his nose at God.

== Themes ==

Many of Vonnegut&#x27;s recurring themes are prevalent in &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot;, most notably the issues of free will and man&#x27;s relation to technology. The former is embodied in the creation of Bokononism, an artificial religion created to make life bearable to the beleaguered inhabitants of San Lorenzo through acceptance and delight in the inevitability of everything that happens. The latter is demonstrated by the development and exploitation of &quot;ice-nine&quot;, which is conceived with indifference but is misused to disastrous ends. In his 1969 address to the American Physical Society, Vonnegut describes the inspiration behind ice-nine and its creator as the type of &quot;old-fashioned scientist who isn&#x27;t interested in people&quot;, and draws connections to nuclear weapons.

More topically, &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot; takes the threat of nuclear destruction in the Cold War as a major theme. The Cuban Missile Crisis, in which world powers collided around a small Caribbean island, bringing the world to the brink of mutual assured destruction, occurred in 1962, and much of the novel can be seen as allegorical.

== Style ==
Like most of Vonnegut&#x27;s work, irony, morbid humor, and parody are used heavily throughout. &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot;, despite its relatively short length, contains 127 discrete chapters, some of which are verses from the Book of Bokonon. Vonnegut himself claimed that his books &quot;are essentially mosaics made up of a whole bunch of tiny little chips... and each chip is a joke.&quot;

== Background ==
After World War II, Kurt Vonnegut worked in the public relations department for General Electric research company. GE hired scientists and let them do pure research, and his job was to interview these scientists and find good stories about their research. Vonnegut felt that the older scientists were indifferent about the ways their discoveries might be used. When science fiction author H. G. Wells visited the labs in the 30s, the Nobel Prize-winning chemist Irving Langmuir suggested for him the idea of a story about a form of ice stable at room temperature. Wells never took it any further, but Vonnegut&#x27;s older brother Bernard, who was Langmuir&#x27;s junior colleague at GE, remembered and told him about it. After both the author and the scientist had died, Vonnegut thought to himself &quot;Finders, keepers – the idea is mine&quot;. Langmuir himself would become the model for Dr. Felix Hoenikker. Vonnegut said in an interview with &quot;The Nation&quot; that &quot;Langmuir was absolutely indifferent to the uses that might be made of the truths he dug out of the rock and handed out to whoever was around, but any truth he found was beautiful in its own right, and he didn&#x27;t give a damn who got it next.&quot; Dr. Felix Hoenikker&#x27;s fictional invention of &quot;ice-nine&quot; was similar in name only to the real substance Ice IX, one of a number of variant structures for ice. Langmuir had worked on seeding ice crystals to diminish or increase rain or storms.

===Setting===
The Republic of San Lorenzo is a fictional country where much of the book&#x27;s second half takes place.

San Lorenzo is a tiny, rocky island nation located in the Caribbean Sea, positioned in the relative vicinity of Puerto Rico. San Lorenzo has only one city, its seaside capital of Bolivar. The country&#x27;s form of government is a dictatorship, under the rule of ailing president &quot;Papa&quot; Monzano, who is a staunch ally of the United States and a fierce opponent of communism. No legislature exists. The infrastructure of San Lorenzo is described as being dilapidated, consisting of worn buildings, dirt roads, an impoverished populace, and having only one working automobile taxi in the entire country.

The language of San Lorenzo is a fictitious English-based creole language (for example &quot;twinkle, twinkle, little star&quot; is rendered &quot;tsvent-kiul, tsvent-kiul, lett-pool store&quot;) that is referred to as &quot;the San Lorenzan dialect&quot;. The San Lorenzan national anthem is based on the tune of &quot;Home on the Range&quot;. Its flag consists of a U.S. Marine Corps corporal&#x27;s chevrons on a blue field (presumably the flag was updated, since in the 1920s Marine Corps rank insignia did not include crossed rifles). Its currency is named the &quot;corporal&quot;, at a rate of two corporals for every United States dollar; both the flag and the monetary unit are named after U.S. Marine Corporal Earl McCabe, who deserted his company while stationed at Port-au-Prince during the American occupation in 1922, and in transit to Miami, was shipwrecked on San Lorenzo. McCabe, along with accomplice Lionel Boyd Johnson from Tobago, together threw out the island&#x27;s governing sugar company and, after a period of anarchy, proclaimed a republic.

San Lorenzo also has its own native religion, Bokononism, a religion based on enjoying life through believing &quot;foma&quot; (harmless lies), and taking encouragement where you can. Bokononism, founded by McCabe&#x27;s accomplice Boyd Johnson (pronounced &quot;Bokonon&quot; in San Lorenzan dialect), however, is outlawed – an idea Bokonon himself conceived, because forbidding the religion would only make it spread quicker. Bokononists are liable to be punished by being impaled on a hook, but Bokononism privately remains the dominant religion of nearly everyone on the island, including the leaders who outlaw it. Officially, however, San Lorenzo is a Christian nation.

==Characters==
* The narrator is a writer who claims his parents named him John but begins the book by stating &quot;Call me Jonah&quot;, alluding to the first line of Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; (&quot;Call me Ishmael&quot;), offering a parallel between &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; and the Jonah&#x27;s interaction with the large fish. Beyond the first page, neither name is mentioned again. He describes the events in the book with humorous and sarcastic detail. While writing a book about the day of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, he becomes involved with the Hoenikker children. Eventually, he is offered the presidency of San Lorenzo by Franklin Hoenikker.
* Felix Hoenikker is the &quot;Father of the Atom Bomb&quot; and an unseen character who died many years before the novel&#x27;s plot begins. Felix Hoenikker was proclaimed one of the smartest scientists on Earth. An eccentric and emotionless man, he is depicted as amoral and apathetic towards anything other than his research. He needed only something to keep him busy, such as in his role as one of the &quot;Fathers of the Atomic Bomb&quot;, and in his creation of &quot;ice-nine&quot;, a potentially catastrophic substance with the capability to destroy all life on Earth, but which he saw merely as a mental puzzle (a Marine general suggested developing a substance that could solidify mud so that soldiers could run across it more easily). During experiments with &quot;ice nine&quot;, Felix took a nap in his rocking chair and died. The narrator&#x27;s quest for biographical details about Hoenikker provides both the background and the connecting thread between the various subsections of the story. 
* Emily Hoenikker was the wife of Felix, and mother to Frank, Angela, and Newt. She died in childbirth with the latter. According to Dr. Asa Breed, a former lover of Emily&#x27;s, the complications at Newt&#x27;s birth were the result of a pelvic injury she sustained in a car accident some time before.
* Dr. Asa Breed is Felix Hoenikker&#x27;s former supervisor. He takes the narrator around Illium and to the General Forge and Foundry Company where the late Felix worked. Later in the tour, Dr. Breed becomes upset with the narrator for misrepresenting scientists.
*Marvin Breed is Asa Breed&#x27;s brother. He owned and operated the tombstone shop in the city where Felix Hoenikker worked on the atomic bomb. Here, the narrator is shocked to find a tombstone with his own last name on it.
* Newton &quot;Newt&quot; Hoenikker: The dwarf (&quot;midget&quot;) son of famed scientist Felix Hoenikker, and a painter. He is the brother of both Frank and Angela Hoenikker. His main hobby is painting minimalist abstract works. He briefly had an affair with a Ukrainian dwarf dancer named Zinka, who turned out to be a KGB agent sent to steal ice-nine for the Soviet Union.
* Franklin &quot;Frank&quot; Hoenikker is Felix Hoenikker&#x27;s older son, and a Major General in San Lorenzo. He is the brother of Newt and Angela Hoenikker. He is an utterly technically minded person who is unable to make decisions except for giving technical advice. His main hobby is building models. Expected to take over for &quot;Papa&quot; Monzano after his death, he anxiously hands the presidency over to the narrator instead.
* Angela Hoenikker Conners is Felix Hoenikker&#x27;s daughter and a clarinetist. She is the married sister of Frank and Newt Hoenikker. In contrast to her dwarf brother, Angela is unusually tall for a woman. She used to take care of her father after her mother&#x27;s death and acts as a mother figure to Newt. She and her brothers all have samples of ice-nine, which they found along with their father&#x27;s body, dead in his chair. It is implied that she used ice-nine to bargain a marriage with her husband. She dies when she blows on a clarinet contaminated with ice-nine after the apocalyptic event at the end of the novel.
* Bokonon (birth name Lionel Boyd Johnson) co-founded San Lorenzo as a republic, along with Earl McCabe (a now-dead US Marine deserter), and created the religion of Bokononism, which he asked McCabe to outlaw in order to give it an alluringly forbidden sense of mystery, giving some meaning to the miserable lives of San Lorenzo&#x27;s extremely impoverished citizens. He therefore has lived for years in exile somewhere in San Lorenzo&#x27;s jungles. He only appears once in the novel in person: in the very final chapter.
* &quot;Papa&quot; Monzano is the ailing dictator of San Lorenzo. He was once Earl McCabe&#x27;s right-hand man and chosen successor. He appoints Frank Hoenikker as his own successor, and then commits suicide with a piece of ice-nine. He is the adopted father of Mona Monzano.
* Mona Aamons Monzano is the 18-year-old adopted daughter of &quot;Papa&quot; Monzano. A gorgeous black girl with blond hair due to her Finnish biological father, her adoption was a political ploy to integrate different races under Monzano&#x27;s rule and provide a beloved poster child for his regime. The narrator describes her as &quot;the only beautiful woman on San Lorenzo&quot;. She is expected to marry Monzano&#x27;s successor, and she therefore agrees to marry the narrator before the disaster at the end of the novel.
* Julian Castle is the multi-millionaire ex-owner of Castle Sugar Cooperation, whom the narrator travels to San Lorenzo to interview for a magazine. He eventually changed his outlook in life, abandoning his business ventures to set up and operate a humanitarian hospital in the jungle of San Lorenzo.
* H. Lowe Crosby is a fervently pro-American bicycle manufacturer the narrator meets on his plane ride to San Lorenzo. His main goal is to move his American factory to San Lorenzo, so he can run it with cheap labor.
* Hazel Crosby is married to H. Lowe Crosby, a Hoosier who believes in some cosmic fraternity among Hoosiers and asks all Hoosiers she meets around the globe to call her &quot;Mom&quot;.
* Philip Castle is the son of Julian Castle, and the operator of a hotel on San Lorenzo. He also wrote a history of San Lorenzo that the narrator reads on his flight to the island. Bokonon taught both him and Mona when they were young students. Through reading the index of Castle&#x27;s book, Claire Minton deduces that he&#x27;s a homosexual.
* Horlick Minton is the new American ambassador to San Lorenzo, whom the narrator meets on his plane ride. He was blacklisted as a Communist sympathizer during the McCarthy era.
* Claire Minton is a writer of book indexes. She is so well versed at indexing that she even claims to be able to deduce strange knowledge about writers based on reading their indexes. She is married to the new American ambassador to San Lorenzo. She and her husband are extremely close, forming what the narrator calls a &quot;duprass&quot;.

==Bokononism==
The semi-humorous religion secretly practiced by the people of San Lorenzo, called Bokononism, encompasses concepts unique to the novel. Many of these concepts use words from the San Lorenzan creole &quot;dialect&quot; of English. Assumed within the religion is the presence of God, who evidently works in mysterious ways. Many of its sacred texts, collectively called &quot;The Books of Bokonon&quot;, are written in the form of calypso songs. Bokononist rituals are equally strange or absurdist; for example, the supreme religious act consists of any two worshippers rubbing the bare soles of their feet together to inspire spiritual connection.

Here are some Bokononist terms:
* &quot;karass&quot; – A group of people linked in a cosmically significant manner, even when superficial linkages are not evident.
* &quot;duprass&quot; – a karass of only two people, who almost always die within a week of each other. The typical example is a loving couple who work together for a great purpose.
* &quot;granfalloon&quot; – a false &quot;karass&quot;; i.e., a group of people who imagine they have a connection that does not really exist. An example is &quot;Hoosiers.&quot; Hoosiers are people from Indiana, and Hoosiers have no true spiritual destiny in common. They really share little more than a name.
* &quot;wampeter&quot; – the central theme or purpose of a &quot;karass&quot;. Each karass has two wampeters at any given time, one waxing and one waning.
* &quot;foma&quot; – harmless untruths
* &quot;wrang-wrang&quot; – Someone who steers a Bokononist away from their line of perception. For example, the narrator of the book is steered away from Nihilism when his Nihilist house sitter kills his cat and leaves his apartment in disrepair.
* &quot;kan-kan&quot; – An object or item that brings a person into their karass. The narrator states in the book that his &quot;kan-kan&quot; was the book he wrote about the Hiroshima bombing.
* &quot;sinookas&quot; – The intertwining &quot;tendrils&quot; of peoples&#x27; lives.
* &quot;vin-dit&quot; – a sudden shove in the direction of Bokononism
* &quot;saroon&quot; – to acquiesce to a &quot;vin-dit&quot;
* &quot;stuppa&quot; – a fogbound child (i.e. an idiot)
* &quot;duffle&quot; – the destiny of thousands of people placed on one &quot;stuppa&quot;
* &quot;sin-wat&quot; – a person who wants all of somebody&#x27;s love for themself
* &quot;pool-pah&quot; – shit storm, but in some contexts: wrath of God
* &quot;Busy, busy, busy&quot; – words Bokononists whisper when they think about how complicated and unpredictable the machinery of life really is
* &quot;Now I will destroy the whole world&quot; – last words of a Bokononist before taking their own life
* &quot;boko-maru&quot; – the supreme act of worship of the Bokononists, which is an intimate act consisting of prolonged physical contact between the naked soles of the feet of two persons
* &quot;zah-mah-ki-bo&quot; – Inevitable destiny
* &quot;Borasisi&quot; and &quot;Pabu&quot;, the Sun god and lunar goddess; the binary trans-Neptunian object 66652 Borasisi and its moon, 66652 Borasisi I Pabu, now bear their names.
** &quot;Borasisi, the Sun, held Pabu, the Moon, in his arms and hoped that Pabu would bear him a fiery child. But poor Pabu gave birth to children that were cold, that did not burn...Then poor Pabu herself was cast away, and she went to live with her favorite child, which was Earth.&quot;

==Reception==
After &quot;The Sirens of Titan&quot; (1959) and &quot;Mother Night&quot; (1962) received favorable reviews and sold well in paperback, large publisher Holt, Rinehart, and Winston issued &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot; as a hardcover original. Theodore Sturgeon praised &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot;, describing its storyline as &quot;appalling, hilarious, shocking, and infuriating&quot;, and concluded that &quot;this is an annoying book and you &quot;must&quot; read it. And you better take it lightly, because if you don&#x27;t you&#x27;ll go off weeping and shoot yourself&quot;.

According to &quot;Indianapolis Monthly&quot;, &quot;In 1972, the school board in Strongsville, Ohio, banned the book without stating an official reason. Notes from the meeting include references to the book as &quot;completely sick&quot; and &quot;garbage&quot;. The ban was overturned in 1976.&quot; Additionally, the book was also challenged in 1982 at New Hampshire&#x27;s Merrimack High School.

&quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot; was nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1964.

==Film, television, and theatrical adaptations==
* A theatrical adaptation (1976) by Bruce Pribram and Ken Kuta was presented and toured by Theatre Express, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
* In 2005, the book was optioned by Leonardo DiCaprio&#x27;s production company, Appian Way Productions. James V. Hart, screenwriter for the film &quot;Contact&quot; (1997), and his son Jake Hart were linked to the developing script.
* A calypso musical adaptation was presented by the Untitled Theater Company #61 in New York in 2008.

==In popular culture==
* The 1964 British science fiction TV series Stingray broadcast a very early dramatization of a scenario inspired by Cat’s Cradle. In the apocalyptic episode “Pink Ice,” the world’s oceans are being frozen by an ice-nine-like substance distributed via seeder mines.
* Jack Lancaster fronted a band in the early 1970s named &quot;Karass&quot; which included Chick Web, Percy Jones, John Goodsall and Robin Lumley.
* A modified version of Bokonon&#x27;s poem &quot;Nice, Nice, Very Nice&quot; (&quot;53rd Calypso&quot;) from the novel was also set to music by the soft rock band Ambrosia, with Vonnegut receiving co-writing credit, and featured as the opening track on their 1975 debut album. Vonnegut wrote to the band after hearing the song on the radio: &quot;I myself am crazy about our song, of course, but what do I know and why wouldn&#x27;t I be? This much I have always known, anyway: Music is the only art that&#x27;s really worth a damn. I envy you guys.&quot;
* The Grateful Dead&#x27;s publishing company, Ice Nine, was named after the fictional substance. Between 1983 and 1985, the band&#x27;s leader Jerry Garcia worked with the scriptwriter and comedian Tom Davis on a screenplay based on the book. The film was never produced.
* Vonnegut collaborated with American composer Dave Soldier for a 2001 CD titled &quot;Ice-9 Ballads&quot;, featuring nine songs with lyrics taken from &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot;. Vonnegut narrated his lyrics to Soldier&#x27;s music.
*The Born Ruffians 2008 album &quot;Red, Yellow &amp; Blue&quot; includes a track called &quot;Kurt Vonnegut&quot; featuring the line from &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot;: &quot;Tiger got to hunt bird got to fly Man got to sit and wonder why, why, why Tiger got to sleep bird got to land Man got to tell himself he understand&quot;.

<doc id="82288" wikidata="Q844793" url="?curid=82288" title="Duma">
<text>A duma () is a Russian assembly with advisory or legislative functions.

The term &quot;boyar duma&quot; is used to refer to advisory councils in Russia from the 10th to 17th centuries. Starting in the 18th century, city dumas were formed across Russia.

The first formally constituted state duma was the Imperial State Duma introduced to the Russian Empire by Emperor Nicholas II in 1905. The Emperor retained an absolute veto and could dismiss the State Duma at any time for a suitable reason. Nicholas dismissed the First State Duma (1906) within 75 days; elections for a second Duma took place the following year. The Russian Provisional Government dissolved the last Imperial State Duma (the fourth Duma) in 1917 during the Russian Revolution.

Since 1993, the State Duma () has functioned as the lower legislative house of the Russian Federation.

==Etymology==
The Russian word is inherited from the Proto-Slavic word &quot;&quot; which is of disputed origin. Its origin has many proposed theories that provide convincing evidence to support each proposed origin. Mladenov, Stender-Petersen: From Proto-Indo-European *dʰewh₂- (“to smoke”), akin to Proto-Slavic *duti (“to blow, to inflate”), *dymъ (“smoke”), perhaps originally meaning “breath, spirit”. Compare Ancient Greek θῡμός (thūmós, “soul, emotion”), occasionally also “thought, mind”.
Vaillant: Contracted from hypothetical *douma &lt; *do- + *umъ (“mind”) + *-a. Compare *douměti (“to comprehend”) (whence Russian надоу́мить (nadoúmitʹ, “to advise”)).
Machek: From an inversion of root *mewHdʰ-, otherwise yielding Proto-Slavic *myslь (“thought”), Ancient Greek μῦθος (mûthos, “word, fable”). Also thought to be derived from Proto-Germanic &quot;&quot;. The word is also related to the Russian verb &quot;dumat′&quot; () meaning &quot;to think&quot;.

==Boyar duma==
The term &quot;boyar duma&quot; () is used to refer to the councils of boyars and junior boyars (boyar scions) which advised the prince on state matters during the times of Kievan Rus&#x27; and the Tsardom of Russia (then tsar). In 1711 Peter the Great transferred its functions to the Governing Senate. Contemporary sources always refer simply to &quot;the boyars&quot; or to &quot;the duma&quot;, but never to the &quot;boyar duma&quot;. Originally there were ten to twelve boyars and five or six &quot;okolnichies&quot;. By 1613 the duma had increased to twenty boyars and eight &quot;okolnichies&quot;. Lesser nobles, &quot;duma gentlemen&quot; (&quot;dumnye dvoriane&quot;) and secretaries, were added to the duma and the number of &quot;okolnichies&quot; rose in the latter half of the 17th century. In 1676, the number of boyars increased to 50 – by then they constituted only a third of the duma.

==Municipal dumas==
Under the reign of Catherine II, reforms to local government led to city dumas being established in Russian cities.

Under the reign of Alexander II, several reforms were enacted during the 1860s and 1870s. These included the creation of local political bodies known as zemstvos. All owners of houses, tax-paying merchants and workmen are enrolled on lists in a descending order according to their assessed wealth. The total valuation is then divided into three equal parts, representing three groups of electors very unequal in number, each of which elects an equal number of delegates to the municipal duma. The executive is in the hands of an elective mayor and an &quot;uprava&quot;, which consists of several members elected by the duma. Under Alexander III, however, by laws promulgated in 1892 and 1894, the municipal dumas were subordinated to the governors in the same way as the zemstvos. In 1894 municipal institutions, with still more restricted powers, were granted to several towns in Siberia, and in 1895 to some in Caucasia.

==State dumas==
===Russian Empire===

Under the pressure of the Russian Revolution of 1905, on 6 August 1905, Sergei Witte issued a manifesto about the convocation of the Duma, initially thought to be an advisory organ. In the subsequent October Manifesto, Nicholas II pledged to introduce basic civil liberties, provide for broad participation in the State Duma, and endow the Duma with legislative and oversight powers.

However, Nicholas II was determined to retain his autocratic power. Just before the creation of the Duma in May 1906, the Tsar issued the Fundamental Laws. It stated in part that the Tsar&#x27;s ministers could not be appointed by, and were not responsible to, the Duma, thus denying responsible government at the executive level. Furthermore, the Tsar had the power to dismiss the Duma and announce new elections whenever he wished. At this first meeting of the Duma members proposed that political prisoners should be released, trade unions given rights and land reform be introduced. Nicholas II rejected these suggestions and dissolved the assembly in July, 1906.

The imperial State Duma was elected four times: in 1906, twice in 1907, and in 1912.

===Russian Federation===

The State Duma (Russian: Государственная дума, &quot;Gosudarstvennaya Duma&quot;, common abbreviation: Госдума, &quot;Gosduma&quot;) in Russia is the lower house of the Federal Assembly of Russia (parliament), the upper house being the Federation Council of Russia. Under Russia&#x27;s 1993 constitution, there are 450 deputies of the State Duma (Article 95), each elected to a term of four years (Article 96); this was changed to a five-year term in late 2008. In previous elections of 1993, 1995, 1999 and 2003 one half of the deputies were elected by a system of proportional representation and one half were elected by plurality in single member districts. However, the 2007 Duma elections were carried out in a new format: all 450 deputies were elected by a system of proportional representation. Russian citizens at least 21 years old are eligible to run for the Duma (Article 97).

<text>A composite number is a positive integer that can be formed by multiplying two smaller positive integers. Accordingly it is a positive integer that has at least one divisor other than 1 and itself. Every positive integer is composite, prime, or the unit 1, so the composite numbers are exactly the numbers that are not prime and not a unit. E.g., the integer 14 is a composite number because it is the product of the two smaller integers 2 × 7 but the integers 2 and 3 are not because each can only be divided by one and itself.

The composite numbers up to 150 are:
:4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, 42, 44, 45, 46, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 60, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 68, 69, 70, 72, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 80, 81, 82, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 98, 99, 100, 102, 104, 105, 106, 108, 110, 111, 112, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 128, 129, 130, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 138, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 150. 

Every composite number can be written as the product of two or more (not necessarily distinct) primes. For example, the composite number 299 can be written as 13 × 23, and the composite number 360 can be written as 23 × 32 × 5; furthermore, this representation is unique up to the order of the factors. This fact is called the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.

There are several known primality tests that can determine whether a number is prime or composite which do not necessarily reveal the factorization of a composite input.

==Types==

One way to classify composite numbers is by counting the number of prime factors. A composite number with two prime factors is a semiprime or 2-almost prime (the factors need not be distinct, hence squares of primes are included). A composite number with three distinct prime factors is a sphenic number. In some applications, it is necessary to differentiate between composite numbers with an odd number of distinct prime factors and those with an even number of distinct prime factors. For the latter 
:formula_1

(where μ is the Möbius function and &quot;x&quot; is half the total of prime factors), while for the former

:formula_2

However, for prime numbers, the function also returns −1 and formula_3. For a number &quot;n&quot; with one or more repeated prime factors,

:formula_4.

If &quot;all&quot; the prime factors of a number are repeated it is called a powerful number (All perfect powers are powerful numbers). If &quot;none&quot; of its prime factors are repeated, it is called squarefree. (All prime numbers and 1 are squarefree.)

For example, 72 = 23 × 32, all the prime factors are repeated, so 72 is a powerful number. 42 = 2 × 3 × 7, none of the prime factors are repeated, so 42 is squarefree.
Another way to classify composite numbers is by counting the number of divisors. All composite numbers have at least three divisors. In the case of squares of primes, those divisors are formula_5. A number &quot;n&quot; that has more divisors than any &quot;x&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot; is a highly composite number (though the first two such numbers are 1 and 2).

Composite numbers have also been called &quot;rectangular numbers&quot;, but that name can also refer to the pronic numbers, numbers that are the product of two consecutive integers.

Yet another way to classify composite numbers is to determine whether all prime factors are either all below or all above some fixed (prime) number. Such numbers are called smooth numbers and rough numbers, respectively.

<doc id="82290" wikidata="Q3540" url="?curid=82290" title="Banten">
<text>Banten (, , Pegon: بنتن) is the westernmost province on the island of Java, Indonesia. Its capital city is Serang and its largest city is Tangerang. The province borders West Java and the Special Capital Region of Jakarta on the east, the Java Sea on the north, the Indian Ocean on the south, and the Sunda Strait (which separates Java from the neighbouring island of Sumatra) on the west and shares a maritime border with Lampung to the west. The province covers an area of . It had a population of over 11.9 million in the 2020 census, up from about 10.6 million in 2010. The estimated mid-2023 population was 12.308 million. Formerly part of the province of West Java, Banten was split off to become a province on 17 October 2000. 

The northern half (particularly the eastern areas near Jakarta and the Java Sea coast) has recently experienced rapid rises in population and urbanization, and the southern half (especially the region facing the Indian Ocean) has a more traditional character but an equally fast-rising population.

Present-day Banten was part of the Sundanese Tarumanagara kingdom from the fourth to the seventh centuries AD. After the fall of Tarumanegara, it was controlled by Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms such as the Srivijaya Empire and the Sunda Kingdom. The spread of Islam in the region began in the 15th century; by the late 16th century, Islam had replaced Hinduism and Buddhism as the dominant religion in the province, with the establishment of the Banten Sultanate. European traders began arriving in the regionfirst the Portuguese, followed by the British and the Dutch. The Dutch East India Company, VOC (Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie), finally controlled the regional economy, gradually weakening the Banten Sultanate. On 22 November 1808, Dutch Governor-General Herman Willem Daendels declared that the Sultanate of Banten had been absorbed into the Dutch East Indies. This began the Bantam Residency, 150 years of direct Dutch rule. In March 1942, the Japanese invaded the Indies and occupied the region for three years before their August 1945 surrender. The region was returned to Dutch control for the next five years before the Dutch left and it was ruled by the Indonesian government. Banten became part of the province of West Java, but separatist efforts led to the creation of the separate province of Banten in October 17, 2000.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Banten&quot; has several possible origins. The first is from the Sundanese phrase &quot;katiban inten,&quot; which means &quot;struck down by diamonds&quot;. The phrase comes from the history of the Bantenese people, who were animists before adopting Buddhism and Hinduism. After Islam began to spread in Banten, the community began to recognize and embrace Islam. The spread of Islam in Banten is described as being &quot;struck down by diamonds&quot;.

Another origin story is that the Indonesian Hindu god Batara Guru traveled from east to west, arriving at Surasowan (present-day Serang). When he arrived, Batara Guru sat on a stone which became known as &quot;watu gilang&quot;. The stone glowed, and was presented to the king of Surasowan. Surasowan was reportedly surrounded by a clear, star-like river, and was described as a ring covered with diamonds (Sundanese: &quot;ban inten&quot;). This evolved into &quot;banten&quot;.

Another possibility is that &quot;Banten&quot; comes from the Indonesian word &quot;bantahan&quot; (rebuttal), because the local Bantenese people resisted the Dutch colonial government. The word &quot;Banten&quot; appeared before the establishment of the Banten Sultanate as the name of a river. The high plains on its banks were called &quot;Cibanten Girang&quot;, shortened to &quot;Banten Girang&quot; (Upper Banten). Based on research in Banten Girang, the area has been settled since the 11th and 12th centuries. During the 16th century, the region developed rapidly towards Serang and the northern coast. The coastal area later became the Sultanate of Banten, founded by Sunan Gunung Jati, which controlled almost all of the former Sunda Kingdom in West Java. Sunda Kelapa (Batavia) was captured by the Dutch, and Cirebon and the Parahiyangan region were captured by the Mataram Sultanate. The Banten Sultanate was later converted into a residency by the Dutch.

== History ==

=== Early history ===

During the fifth century, Banten was part of the kingdom of Tarumanagara. The fourth-century Lebak inscription, discovered in 1947 in a lowland village on the Cidanghiyang River in , contains two lines of Sanskrit poetry in the Pallawa script which describes life in the kingdom under the reign of Purnawarman. The kingdom collapsed after an attack by Srivijaya, and western Java became part of the Sunda Kingdom. In the Chinese &quot;Chu-fan-chi&quot;, written around 1225, Chou Ju-kua wrote that Srivijaya ruled Sumatra, the Malay peninsula, and western Java during the early 13th century. &quot;Chu-fan-chi&quot; identified the port of Sunda as strategic and thriving, with pepper from Sunda among the highest quality. The population were made up of farmers, and their houses were built on wooden poles (&quot;rumah panggung&quot;). Robbery, however, was common.

According to Portuguese explorer Tome Pires, Bantam (Banten) was an important early-16th-century port in the Kingdom of Sunda along with the ports of Pontang, Cheguide (Cigede), Tangaram (Tangerang), Calapa (Sunda Kelapa) and Chimanuk (on the Cimanuk river estuary). In 1527, as the Portuguese fleet arrived off the coast, newly-converted Javanese Muslims under Sunan Gunungjati captured the port of Banten and the surrounding area from the Sundanese and established the Sultanate of Banten. According to Portuguese historian João de Barros, Banten was the center of the sultanate and a major Southeast Asian port (rivaling Malacca and Makassar). The town of Banten was in the middle of the bay, about across. It was 850 fathoms in length. A river, navigable by junks, flowed through the center of the town; a small tributary extended to the town&#x27;s edge. The present-day river is smaller, and only navigable by small boats. A fortress near the town had brick walls seven palms thick. Armed, wooden defence buildings were two stories high. The town square was used for military activities and folk art, with a market in the morning. The palace was on the south side of the square. Next to the palace is a tall, flat-roofed building known as Srimanganti, which was used by the king to meet his subjects. West of the square is the Great Mosque of Banten.

=== Colonial era ===

When the Dutch arrived in Indonesia, the Portuguese had long been in Banten. The English established a factory in Banten, followed by the Dutch. The French and the Danish also came to trade in Banten. In the competition among European traders, the Dutch emerged victorious. The Portuguese left Banten in 1601 after their fleet was destroyed by the Dutch off the coast during the Dutch–Portuguese War.

In 16th century, Chinese junk ships regularly traded with Jambi, Patani, Siam and Cambodia. Local Muslim women who dealt in the cloth trade willingly married Han Chinese men in Palembang and Jambi and also local Muslim women in Banten married Han Chinese men. The Han Chinese men usually converted to Islam to please their Muslim wives. 

Although the Dutch won the war, they preserved the Banten Sultanate. The maritime sultanate relied on trade, and the pepper monopoly in Lampung made the Banten authorities intermediaries. The sultanate grew rapidly, becoming a commercial center. As sea trade increased throughout the archipelago, Banten became a multi-ethnic region. Assisted by the British, Danish and Chinese, Banten traded with Persia, India, Siam, Vietnam, the Philippines, China and Japan. The reign of Sultan Ageng Tirtayasa was the sultanate&#x27;s height. Under his reign, Banten had one of the strongest navies in the region, built to European standards with help from European shipbuilders and attracted Europeans to the sultanate. To secure its shipping lanes, Banten sent its fleet to Sukadana (the present-day Ketapang Regency in West Kalimantan) and conquered it in 1661. Banten also tried to escape the pressure of the Dutch East India Company (VOC), which had blockaded incoming merchant ships.

A power struggle developed around 1680 between Ageng Tirtayasa and his son, Abu Nashar Abdul Qahar (also known as Sultan Haji). The disagreement was exploited by the VOC, who supported Haji and causing a civil war. Strengthening his position, Haji sent two envoys to meet King Charles II of England in London in 1682 to obtain support and weapons. In the ensuing war, Ageng withdrew from his palace to Tirtayasa (present-day Tangerang); on 28 December 1682, the region was seized by Haji with Dutch assistance. Ageng and his other sons, Pangeran Purbaya and Syekh Yusuf from Makassar, retreated to the southern Sunda interior. On 14 March 1683, Sultan Ageng was captured and imprisoned in Batavia.

The VOC continued to pursue and suppress Sultan Ageng&#x27;s followers, led by Prince Purbaya and Sheikh Yusuf. On 5 May 1683, the VOC sent Lieutenant Untung Surapati and his Balinese troops, joining forces led by VOC Lieutenant Johannes Maurits van Happel to subdue the and Dayeuhluhur regions; on 14 December 1683, they captured Sheikh Yusuf. Heavily outnumbered, Prince Purbaya surrendered. Surapati was ordered by Captain Johan Ruisj to pick up Purbaya and bring him to Batavia. They met with VOC forces led by Willem Kuffeler, but a dispute between them destroyed Kuffeler&#x27;s forces; Surapati and his followers became fugitives from the VOC.
Lampung was given to the VOC on 12 March 1682 by Sultan Haji as compensation for the company&#x27;s support, and a 22 August 1682 letter gave the VOC the province&#x27;s pepper monopoly. The sultanate also had to reimburse the VOC for losses caused by the war. After Sultan Haji&#x27;s death in 1687, the VOC&#x27;s influence in the sultanate began to increase; the appointment of a new sultan required the approval of the governor-general in Batavia. Sultan Abu Fadhl Muhammad Yahya ruled for about three years before he was replaced by his brother, Pangeran Adipati (Sultan Abul Mahasin Muhammad Zainul Abidin). The civil war in Banten left instability for the next government, due to dissatisfaction with the VOC&#x27;s interference in local affairs. Popular resistance peaked again at the end of the reign of Sultan Abul Fathi Muhammad Syifa Zainul Arifin. The sultan sought VOC assistance against the rebellion, and Banten became a vassal state of the company in 1752.

In 1808, at the peak of the Napoleonic Wars, Governor-general Herman Willem Daendels ordered the construction of the Great Post Road to defend Java from British attack. Daendels ordered the sultan of Banten to move his capital to Anyer and provide labor to build a port in Ujung Kulon. The sultan defied Daendels&#x27; order, and Daendels ordered an attack on Banten and the destruction of Surosowan Palace. The sultan and his family were held in the palace before their imprisonment in Fort Speelwijk. Sultan Abul Nashar Muhammad Ishaq Zainulmutaqin was then exiled to Batavia. On 22 November 1808, Daendels announced from his Serang headquarters that the sultanate had been absorbed into the Dutch East Indies. The sultanate was abolished in 1813 by the British after the invasion of Java. That year, Sultan Muhammad bin Muhammad Muhyiddin Zainussalihin was disarmed and forced to abdicate by Thomas Stamford Raffles; this ended the sultanate. After the British returned Java to the Dutch in 1814 as part of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814, Banten became a &quot;residentie&quot; (residency) of the Dutch East Indies.

=== Japanese occupation and independence ===

The Empire of Japan invaded the East Indies, expelling the Dutch, and occupied Banten in March 1942. During their three years of occupation, the Japanese built the Saketi–Bayah railway in southern Lebak to transport brown coal from the Bayah mines. The project involved a workforce of about 1,000 rōmusha (local forced labourers) and a few engineers and technicians (mainly Dutch), supervised by the Japanese. The rōmusha working in the mines were taken from Central and East Java, the railway rōmusha were primarily from Banten. The construction took 12 million human days over 14 months. Working conditions were harsh due to food shortages, lack of medical care, and the tropical climate. Casualties are estimated at 20,000 to 60,000, not including mine workers.

After Japan surrendered in August 1945, the Dutch East Indies declared independence as the Republic of Indonesia. This was opposed by the returning Dutch, resulting in the Indonesian war of independence. During the war, Banten remained under Indonesian control. On 26 February 1948, the State of West Java (, ) was established; on 24 April 1948, it was renamed Pasundan. Pasundan became a federal state of the United States of Indonesia in 1949, and was incorporated into the Republic of Indonesia on 11 March 1950.

After Indonesian independence, Banten became part of the province of West Java. Separatist sentiment led to the creation of the province of Banten in October 17, 2000.

== Geography ==
Banten lies between 5°7&#x27;50&quot; and 7°1&#x27;11&quot; south latitude and 105°1&#x27;11&quot; and 106°7&#x27;12&quot; east longitude. The province has a land area of .

It is near the Sunda Strait&#x27;s sea lanes, which link Australia and New Zealand with Southeast Asia. Banten also links Java and Sumatra. The region has a number of industries; its seaports handle overflow cargo from the seaport in Jakarta, and are intended to be an alternative to the Port of Singapore.

Its location on the western tip of Java makes Banten the gateway to Java, Sumatra and the adjacent areas of Jakarta, Indonesia&#x27;s capital. Bordering the Java Sea on the north, the Sunda Strait on the west and the Indian Ocean on the south, the province has abundant marine resources.

The land area includes some 81 offshore islands (large enough to have names) of which 50 are in Pandeglang Regency, 4 in Lebak Regency, 9 in Serang Regency, 5 in Cilegon City and 11 in Tangerang Regency.
=== Topography ===
The province ranges in altitude from sea level to . Banten is primarily lowland (below 50 metres above sea level) in Cilegon, Tangerang, Pandeglang Regency, and most of Serang Regency. The central Lebak and Pandeglang Regencies range from , and the eastern Lebak Regency ranges in altitude from at the summit of Mount Halimun.

Banten&#x27;s geomorphology generally consists of lowlands and sloping and steep hills. The lowlands are generally in the north and south.

The sloping hills have a minimum height of above sea level. Mount Gede, north of Cilegon, has an altitude of above sea level; there are also hills in the southern Serang Regency, in the Mancak and Waringin Kurung Districts. The southern Pandeglang Regency is also hilly. In eastern Lebak Regency, bordering Bogor Regency and Sukabumi Regency in West Java, most of the region consists of steep hills of old sedimentary rock interspersed with igneous rocks such as granite, granodiorite, diorite and andesite. It also contains valuable tin and copper deposits.

=== Climate ===
Banten&#x27;s climate is influenced by the South and East Asian Monsoons and the alternating La Niña or El Niño. During the rainy season, the weather is dominated by a west wind (from Sumatra and the Indian Ocean south of the Indian subcontinent) joined by winds from Northern Asia crossing the South China Sea. The dry season is dominated by an east wind which gives Banten severe droughts, especially on the northern coast during El Niño. Temperatures on the coast and in the hills range from , and temperatures in the mountains from above sea level range from .

The heaviest rainfall ranges from during the rainy season from September to May, covering half of the western Pandeglang Regency. Rainfall from covers half of Tangerang Regency, the northern Serang Regency, and the cities of Cilegon and Tangerang. In the dry season (from April to December), the peak rainfall of covers half of the northern Serang and Tangerang Regencies and the cities of Cilegon and Tangerang. The lowest dry-season rainfall, from June to September, covers half of the southern Tangerang Regency and 15 percent of southeastern Serang Regency.

== Government and administrative divisions ==
Banten consists of four regencies (&quot;kabupaten&quot;) and four autonomous cities (&quot;kota&quot;), listed below with their populations in the 2010 and 2020 censuses and in official mid-2023 estimates. The cities and regencies are subdivided into 155 districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;) as at 2023, in turn sub-divided into 314 urban villages (&quot;kelurahan&quot;) and 1,238 rural villages (&quot;desa&quot;).

Over half (54.48% in mid 2023) of the population lives in the northeast corner of the province on just 14.6% of its land area. This corner, which comprises Tangerang Regency, Tangerang City and South Tangerang City, is part of the Jakarta metropolitan area (&quot;Jabodetabek&quot;).

The province comprises three of Indonesia&#x27;s 84 national electoral districts to elect members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. The Banten I Electoral District consists of the regencies of Pandeglang and Lebak, and elects 6 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. The Banten II Electoral District consists of the regency of Serang, together with the cities of Ciligon and Serang, and elects 6 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. The Banten III Electoral District consists of the regency of Tangerang, together with the cities of Tangerang and South Tangerang, and elects 10 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council.

It was Indonesia&#x27;s fifth-most-populous province, after West Java, East Java, Central Java and North Sumatra. By mid-2022, the estimated total had risen to 12,251,985.

=== Ethnic groups ===

The Bantenese people are the largest group in the province, forming 47% of the total population. They mostly inhabit the central and southern part of the province. The origins of the Bantenese people; which are closely related to the Banten Sultanate, are different from the Cirebonese people whom are not part of the Sundanese people nor the Javanese people (unless it is from the result of a mixture of two major cultures, namely Sundanese and Javanese). The Bantenese people along with the Baduy people (Kanekes) are essentially a subdivision of the Sundanese people which occupies the former region of the Banten Sultanate (region of Bantam Residency after the abolishment and annexation by the Dutch East Indies). Only after the formation of the Banten Province did people began to regard the Bantenese as a group of people with a culture and language of their own.

Most of the north Banten population is Javanese. Most of the Javanese are migrants from central and eastern Java. The Betawi people live in greater Jakarta, including Tangerang. Chinese Indonesians may also be found in urban areas, also primarily in the greater Jakarta area. The Benteng Chinese (a subgroup of Chinese Indonesians) lives in Tangerang and the surrounding area, and are distinct from other Chinese Indonesians.

=== Languages ===

The province&#x27;s dominant language is Sundanese. Its indigenous people speak a dialect derived from archaic Sundanese, classified as informal in modern Sundanese.

The Mataram Sultanate tried to control West Java, including Banten; the Sultanate of Banten defended its territory except for Banten. In the mountains and most of present-day Banten, the &quot;loma&quot; version of the Sundanese language is dominant; this version is considered &quot;harsh&quot; by people from Parahyangan. Bantenese is commonly spoken, especially in the southern Pandeglang and Lebak Regencies. Near Serang and Cilegon, the Javanese Banyumasan dialect is spoken by about 500,000 people. In northern Tangerang, Betawi is spoken by Betawi immigrants. Indonesian is also widely spoken, especially by urban migrants from other parts of Indonesia. The Baduy people speak the Baduy language, also an archaic form of Sundanese.

=== Religion ===

Most residents are Muslims (94.85% of population), and the Banten Sultanate was one of the largest Islamic kingdoms on the island of Java. The province also has other ethnicities and religions, including the Benteng Chinese community in Tangerang and the Baduy people who practice Sunda Wiwitan in Kanekes, Leuwidamar, Lebak Regency.

Based on archaeological data, early Banten society was influenced by the Hindu-Buddhist Tarumanagara, Sriwijaya and Sunda Kingdoms. According to the &quot;Babad Banten&quot;, Sunan Gunung Jati and Maulana Hasanuddin spread Islam extensively in the region. Maulana Yusuf reportedly engaged in &quot;da&#x27;wah&quot; in the interior, and conquered Pakuan Pajajaran.

The sultan of Banten&#x27;s genealogy reportedly traced back to Muhammad, and the &quot;ulamas&quot; were influential. Tariqa Sufism developed in the region.

== Culture ==

Banten&#x27;s culture is based on Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam. It includes the pencak silat martial arts, the Saman dance, and . Religious sites include the Great Mosque of Banten and the Keramat Panjang Tomb.

The Baduy people live in central and southern Banten. The Inner Baduy tribes are native Sundanese who are opposed to modernization in dress and lifestyle, and the Outer Baduy tribes are more open to modernization. The Baduy-Rawayan tribe lives in the Kendeng Cultural Heritage Mountains, an area of spanning the Kanekes area, Leuwidamar District, Lebak Regency. Baduy villages are generally located on the Ciujung River in the Kendeng Mountains.

=== Weapons ===
The golok, similar to a machete, is Banten&#x27;s traditional weapon. Formerly a self-defence weapon, it is now a martial-arts tool. The Baduy people use goloks for farming and forest hunting. Other traditional weapons include the kujang, kris, spear, sledgehammer, machete, sword and bow and arrow.

=== Traditional housing ===
Traditional housing in Banten has thatched roofing, with floors made of split and pounded bamboo. This type of traditional house is still widely found in areas inhabited by the Kanekes and Baduy peoples.

=== Clothing ===
Bantenese men traditionally wear closed-neck shirts and trousers belted with batik, perhaps with a golok tucked into the belt. Bantenese women traditionally wear a kebaya, decorated with a hand-crafted brooch at the waist. Hair is tied into a bun, and decorated with a flower.

=== Islamic architecture ===
Three-level mosque architecture is symbolic of tariqa &quot;ihsan&quot; (beauty) and sharia (law).

=== Pencak silat ===

Pencak silat is a group of martial arts, rooted in Indonesian culture, which reportedly existed throughout the archipelago since the seventh century. It began to be recorded when it was influenced by the &quot;ulamas&quot; during the spread of Islam in the 15th century. At that time, martial arts were taught with religious studies in &quot;pesantren&quot; (Islamic boarding schools). Religion and pencak silat became intertwined. Silat evolved from folk dancing, becoming part of the region&#x27;s defense against invaders.

Banten is known for its warriors, who are proficient in the martial arts. &quot;Debus&quot; (from ) is a Bantenese martial art which was developed during the 16th century.

== Tourism ==

Banten is one of the favorite tourist areas in Indonesia, especially for local residents from Jakarta and West Java, especially Bogor. The Banten region, which is close to the west coast of Java Island, has a panorama located in Banten Bay such as , and others as well as resort islands such as Umang and Sangiang Islands. The uniqueness of the Banten community, especially the Baduy people who still maintain their ancestral customs, is also interesting to explore, as well as the rare Javan rhinoceros sanctuary in the Ujung Kulon National Park which has been designated as a world heritage site. Banten also has historical tourist destinations such as the Great Mosque of Banten, the Old Banten Museum, the Multatuli Museum.

Tanjung Lesung Beach, in the Panimbang district of western Pandeglang Regency, covers about . A proposed special economic zone in 2012, the Tanjung Lesung SEZ became operational on 23 February 2015. Pulau Dua, covering about near Serang, is known for its ocean coral, fish and of birds. Between April and August each year, it is visited by about 40,000 birds from 60 species from Australia, Asia and Africa. Originally an island, sedimentation has joined it to mainland Java.

== Transport ==

Banten is in western Java. In 2006, of its national roads were in good condition; were in fair condition, and were in poor condition. At the end of that year, of Banten&#x27;s provincial road network were in good condition; were in fair condition, and were in poor condition. The province&#x27;s national roads are congested; provincial roads have less traffic, and congestion is generally localized.

Rail transport is declining; 48 percent of Banten&#x27;s rail network was operational in 2005, with an average of 22 passenger trains and 16 freight trains per day. Most lines were single-track, and the main line was the Merak-Tanah Abang, Tangerang-Duri, Cilegon-Cigading line, and Soekarno–Hatta Airport Rail Link serving Manggarai-Soetta Airport along with the Skytrain. Then Jakarta MRT Phase 3 with Balaraja to Cikarang, will be construction in 2024.

Soekarno–Hatta International Airport is Indonesia&#x27;s main national airport. Other airports include the general-aviation Pondok Cabe Airport in South Tangerang, Budiarto Airport in Tangerang (for training), and Gorda Airport in Serang (used by the Indonesian Air Force).
== Economy ==
 
Banten&#x27;s 2006 population totaled 9,351,470, with 36.04 percent children, 2.57 percent elderly, and the remainder 15 to 64 years old.

Industry had 23.11 percent of jobs, followed by agriculture (21.14 percent), trade (20.84 percent) and transportation and communication (9.5 percent). The northern part of the province is more economically developed than the southern part.

It is strategically located between Java and Sumatra. Most investment is in Tangerang, South Tangerang and the rest of the north because of their infrastructure and proximity to Jakarta. Infrastructure in southern Banten lags behind that of the north, and Banten&#x27;s development policies have prioritised growth over equality in Pandeglang and Lebak regencies; investors choose areas with existing infrastructure to ensure competitiveness.

<text>Robby the Robot is a fictional character and science fiction icon who first appeared in the 1956 film &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;. He made a number of subsequent appearances in science fiction films and television programs, which has given him the distinction as &quot;the hardest working robot in Hollywood&quot;.

==Precursors of the name==
The name &quot;Robbie&quot; (spelled with an &quot;ie&quot;) had appeared in science fiction before &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;. In a pulp magazine adventure &quot;The Fantastic Island&quot; (1935), the name is used for a mechanical likeness of Doc Savage used to confuse foes. The name is also used in Isaac Asimov&#x27;s short story &quot;Robbie&quot; (1940) about a first-generation robot designed to care for children. In &quot;Tom Swift on The Phantom Satellite&quot; (1956), it is also the name given to a small four-footed robot designed by Tom Swift Jr., the boy inventor in the &quot;Tom Swift Jr.&quot; science fiction novel series by Victor Appleton II.

==&quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;==
===Story background===
Robby the Robot originated as a supporting character in the 1956 MGM science fiction film &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;. The film&#x27;s storyline centers on a crew of Earth explorers who land their starship, the C57-D, on the planet Altair IV, inhabited by the mysterious human Dr. Morbius and his daughter Altaira who was born there. Robby is a mechanical servant that Morbius has designed, built, and programmed using knowledge gleaned from his study of the ancient Krell, a long-extinct race of highly intelligent beings that once populated Altair IV. The film’s plot is loosely based on William Shakespeare’s play &quot;The Tempest&quot; (1610), with the planet Altair IV standing in for Shakespeare’s remote island and Dr. Morbius for Prospero. In this context Robby is analogous to Ariel, a spirit enslaved by Prospero.

Robby exhibits artificial intelligence, but has a distinct personality that at times exhibits a dry wit. He is instructed by Morbius to be helpful to the Earthmen and does so by synthesizing and transporting to their landing site 10 tons of &quot;isotope 217&quot;, a lightweight though still effective replacement for the requested lead shielding needed to house the C57-D’s main stardrive to power an attempt to contact Earth base for further instructions. Morbius programmed Robby to obey a system of rules similar to Isaac Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics as expressed in &quot;I, Robot&quot; (1950). One of the laws is a rule against harming or killing humans. This becomes an important plot point near the conclusion of the film when Robby refuses to kill the Id monster; he recognizes the invisible creature to be an alter ego/avatar of Dr. Morbius. Hollywood purposely, and misleadingly, depicts Robby in the film’s advertising posters as a terrifying adversarial creature carrying a seductively posed unconscious maiden (Altaira), but no such scene is in the film and the images do not reflect in any way Robby&#x27;s benevolent and intelligent character. Robby only carries one person during the film, the Earth starship&#x27;s Dr. Ostrow, when he is mortally wounded near the end of the film.

===Design and construction===
Robby was designed by members of the MGM art department and constructed by the studio&#x27;s prop department; The design was developed from initial ideas and sketches by production designer Arnold &quot;Buddy&quot; Gillespie, art director Arthur Lonergan, and writer Irving Block. These concepts were refined by production illustrator Mentor Huebner and perfected by MGM staff production draughtsman and mechanical designer Robert Kinoshita.

The robot&#x27;s groundbreaking design and execution represented a radical advance on the conventional &quot;walking oil-can&quot; depictions of robots in earlier feature films and movie serials. The only previous film robot of comparable style and quality was the &quot;Menschmaschine&quot; created for Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1927). However, this did not come cheap: As with every aspect of the production of &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;, MGM spared no expense on Robby&#x27;s design and construction. With reported costs ranging from $100,000 and $125,000 (equivalent to at least $US1.1 million today) it was, proportional to total budget, one of the most expensive single film props ever created up to that time, which represented nearly 7% of the film&#x27;s total budget of US$1.9 million. (By way of comparison, Robby cost roughly the same, proportional to total budget, as the massive 27-ton, 12 meter-diameter, rotating centrifuge set built for Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, which cost US$750,000 against a total budget of around US$11 million). But thanks to its imaginative design, intricate detailing, and the very high visual quality of the final product, Robby immediately became the &quot;face&quot; of the film and soon became an enduring popular culture icon.

Robby was constructed using a range of materials including metal, plastic, rubber, glass, and Plexiglas. The plastic parts were a pioneering example of the use of the then novel technology of vacuum-forming heated plastic over wooden molds. These parts were made from an early form of ABS plastic with the brand name &quot;Royalite&quot;, a material mainly used at the time for making suitcases. The finished Robby stands just over tall and was fabricated in three detachable sections: the legs and lower torso, the barrel-like chest section (which included the arms), and the highly detailed head piece.

The tall paraboloidal plexiglass dome that covered the head housed the detailed mechanisms representing Robby&#x27;s electronic brain. These included a &quot;pilot light&quot; at the very top, an intricate apparatus terminating in three white wire-frame spheres that rotate in planetary fashion (representing his gyroscopic stabilizers), a pair of reciprocating arms in the shape of an inverted &quot;V&quot;, multiple flashing lights, and an elaborate horizontal array of moving levers resembling saxophone keys. Conical protuberances attached to each side of the head carry two small forward-facing blinking lights (his eyes) and two rotating chromed rings, one mounted vertically and the other horizontally, which represent Robby&#x27;s audio detectors (his ears). The bottom front section of the head is a curved grille consisting of parallel rows of thin blue neon tubes, which light up in voice synchronization when Robby speaks. This neon grille also enabled the operator to both see out and to breathe. The joint between the head and chest section was fitted with a custom-made bearing that allowed the head to rotate in either direction.

Robby&#x27;s bulky barrel-shaped torso (a sly reference to Bob Kinoshita&#x27;s earlier job as a washing machine designer) featured a front panel fitted with a rectangular door at the top (into which samples of any substance could be inserted for Robby to analyze and replicate); underneath the slot were two rotating discs fitted with small flashing lights and below that a row of five buttons that moved in and out. Robby&#x27;s thick, stubby arms were connected to his body with plastic ball-joints that fitted into matching sockets in the torso, allowing the joints a small amount of rotational movement. The arms could also be extended and this section was covered with an expanding concertina-type tubular rubber sheath. Robby&#x27;s three-fingered hands were also made of rubber, finished with the suit&#x27;s overall gunmetal metallic gray paint. The chest section attached to the leg section with special locking clips. The bottom section of the suit hinged at the top of the legs, allowing Robby to both bend forward and swing each leg backward and forward slightly, enabling him to walk with relative ease (albeit with rather small and stiff steps). Robby&#x27;s legs were made from interlocking globes of vacuum-formed plastic, which were connected by internal jointing that permitted the entire leg to bend slightly, but cleverly concealed the movement of the hips and knees of the human operator inside.

Robby&#x27;s design was a major advance on all previous screen robots in many practical and aesthetic respects. By comparison, the robot Gort, the menacing &quot;interstellar policeman&quot; from the science fiction film &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; (1951) was a very tall man in the robot suit, and its smooth design posed several practical problems for shooting. Because it was made of flexible neoprene overall, similar to a skin diver&#x27;s wetsuit, the props team had to fabricate two suits that laced up in order to keep the fastenings out of sight while filming Gort moving: One suit laced up at the back (for frontal shots), and the second, which laced up from the front, was used for the shots in which Gort was seen from behind. The neoprene suit creased at the hips, back knees, and front elbows when the actor inside moved, giving the impression of being made from a &quot;flexible&quot; alien metal. The filmmakers diminished the effect by cleverly keeping Gort&#x27;s movements to a minimum or by only shooting his upper body when he walked.

Robby&#x27;s similar size and its construction from rigid sections that had articulated joints combined to create a convincing viewing experience. To access the suit, the three sections were dismantled and the operator climbed into the legs. The torso was then placed around him, the two sections were secured with internal clips, and the operator was strapped into an internal over the shoulder harness; finally the head was fitted, the internal electronics were connected to external power via hidden cables, and the suit was switched on and ready for filming. This design made it possible to film Robby from any angle and for him to move about and carry out the actions required in a scene, without either betraying the obvious presence of an interior operator or revealing how each got in and out; Robby was operated (uncredited) by stuntmen Frankie Darro and Frankie Carpenter, both short actors (Darro was 5&#x27;3&quot;).

One of the suit&#x27;s few drawbacks was that the many intricate moving parts in the electrified headpiece made a considerable amount of noise when Robby was powered up. During shooting, Robby&#x27;s voice was performed off-camera by an uncredited actor, who spoke lines into a microphone that fed into a voice-actuated circuit connected by a cable running into Robby&#x27;s foot, up through a leg, and all the way to the neon tubes in Robby&#x27;s lower headpiece; this device generated a control voltage that synchronized the voicebox&#x27;s flashing neon tubes. Robby&#x27;s screen voice in the finished film was re-recorded in post-production by actor Marvin Miller. (Actor Les Tremayne read the film&#x27;s opening prologue.)

==Later appearances==
The robot quickly became a science fiction icon in the decades that followed and was reused or recreated in multiple TV shows. Robby was reused by MGM in &quot;The Invisible Boy&quot; (1957) and then made several further appearances in other films and TV shows during the next few decades; these include episodes of &quot;The Gale Storm Show&quot;, &quot;The Thin Man&quot;, &quot;Columbo&quot;, &quot;The Addams Family&quot;, and &quot;Lost in Space&quot; where he battles The Robot. While Robby&#x27;s appearance was generally consistent, there were exceptions.

The original Rod Serling incarnation of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, which was substantially filmed at MGM Studios, made extensive use of props and costumes originally created for &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;, including Robby, who appeared in three episodes over the series&#x27; original run: &quot;One for the Angels&quot; (s01e02, 1959), &quot;Uncle Simon&quot; (s05e08, 1963) and &quot;The Brain Center at Whipple&#x27;s&quot; (s05e33, 1964). In &quot;Uncle Simon&quot; (1963), Robby&#x27;s appearance was considerably altered, combining the familiar body with an alternative head piece. According to Robby&#x27;s past owner, director William Malone, the head used in this episode was a prototype created during Robby&#x27;s original construction at MGM. It featured a highly simplified and rather old-fashioned cylindrical &quot;oil can&quot; robot head with stylized &quot;eyes&quot; (that were illuminated and movable) and a circular &quot;mouth&quot;; this was enclosed under the distinctively-shaped conical plexiglass dome, but this head&#x27;s front grille also did not have the blue neon tubes and lacked the rotating external &quot;ear&quot; pieces seen in &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;. It is not known whether this internal &quot;oil-can&quot; head was original, but its rather rudimentary design and appearance is clearly not of the same exacting MGM standards that are evident in all other &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; props, and suggests it may have been custom-made for the filming of this &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode. However, this version of the prop survives and was also owned until recently by William Malone.

In other appearances, Robby usually retained the moving parts inside his transparent dome, although the details of his &quot;brain&quot; and chest panel were sometimes altered; in &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; episode &quot;The Bridge of Lions Affair&quot;, only Robby&#x27;s head dome was used as part of a regeneration machine. Robby also appeared in the &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot; second-season episode &quot;Dr. Morkenstein&quot;, this time representing a character called Chuck (voiced by actor Roddy McDowall) whom Mork befriends while working as a security guard in the science museum where Chuck is on display. Robby was given a major makeover for his appearance in the TV series &quot;Project U.F.O.&quot; (1978). The original head was removed and replaced with a newly constructed &quot;cyclops&quot; head that had new internal &quot;brain&quot; fittings, a much squatter (roughly hemispherical) perspex dome, and a large circular glowing green &quot;eye&quot; on the front, mounted in a protruding triangular panel. The front panel on Robby&#x27;s torso was also modified with the addition of a new protruding panel, and additional appliances and cables were added to the front of both legs. This &quot;cyclops&quot; version of Robby was also used in the 1977 TV series &quot;Space Academy&quot; and the 1988 B-movie &quot;Phantom Empire&quot;. All appearances of Robby after 1971 used a replica, as the original was retired and put on display in a southern California car museum (see below).

Robby made few appearances after the 1970s, but he does have a cameo in the film &quot;Gremlins&quot; (1984); he can be seen standing in the background speaking some of his trademark lines. Aside from that, he also appeared in &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot; (2003). He was also featured in a 2006 commercial for AT&amp;T.

Robby the Robot was inducted into the Robot Hall of Fame in 2004.

==Original &quot;Robby&quot; suit==
In 1971, the original 1956 Robby the Robot was sold to Jim Brucker and put on display at his Movie World/Cars of the Stars Museum, near Disneyland in Buena Park, California, where he was often vandalized by visitors. Robot historian Fred Barton was commissioned to restore Robby to his original 1956 state while the robot was still on display at the museum. Barton used original duplicate replacement parts made for the &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; suit by MGM&#x27;s prop department. It was, however, in a desperate condition once again several years later. The museum closed in 1980, and Robby, along with his transport vehicle, original MGM spare parts, and shipping containers were sold to William Malone. Malone noted that Robby had once again fallen into a state of disrepair. Having built the first ever replica of Robby in 1973, Malone was able to carefully restore the robot prop to its original condition using additional spare parts which the original builders had stockpiled in Robby&#x27;s storage cases some 25 years earlier. The original Robby the Robot remained in Malone&#x27;s original &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; props collection for many years, until finally being sold by Bonhams Auctioneers in New York on November 21, 2017, for . Robby became the most expensive film prop ever sold at auction.

==Replicas==

Fred Barton built a second Robby replica which appeared at the 1974 Star Trek Convention in Los Angeles. Barton continues to produce Robby props and other 1:1 robot replicas. His recreations are currently on display at the Experience Music Project and Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame in Seattle, Washington, and at the Metreon entertainment complex in San Francisco; other Robby replicas are on display in various venues. Full-sized, remote-controlled Barton robot props are available from Hammacher Schlemmer or ordered directly on-line from Fred Barton Productions; the company manufactures various 1:1 film and TV robot reproductions under license, aimed at the growing science fiction film collectors&#x27; market. Robby has also become a popular subject of collector tin toy and plastic robot reproductions and model kits.

A replica or variant of Robby is on display at the National Atomic Testing Museum in Las Vegas as a sci-fi pop culture artifact from the 1950s.

<text>Nanyang Technological University (NTU) is a public research university in Singapore. Founded in 1981, it is also the second oldest autonomous university in the country.

The university is organised across numerous colleges and schools, including the College of Engineering, College of Science, Nanyang Business School, Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, College of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences, Graduate College, National Institute of Education, and S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. NTU is also home to several Research Centres of Excellence such as the Earth Observatory of Singapore and Singapore Centre on Environmental Life Sciences Engineering. NTU&#x27;s main campus covers of land, making it the largest university campus in Singapore.

The primary campus grounds are located in the western part of Singapore, along 50 Nanyang Avenue. It also has two other campuses in Singapore&#x27;s healthcare and start-up districts, Novena and one-north respectively. As a large, comprehensive, university, it has 34,384 enrolled students, and 7,613 faculty and staff as of 2021.

==History==
===Nanyang University (1960–1980)===
In 1955, prior to Singapore&#x27;s independence from the British, Nanyang University was established south of the current Nanyang Technological University campus, with the centre of the present Yunnan Garden as its heart. Its administration building currently houses the Chinese Heritage Centre, a national monument.

=== Renaming and merger (1980)===
Although NTU occupies the grounds of the former Nanyang University (NU), and has a similar name, it is not a direct continuation of that institution. In 1980, the Government of Singapore merged Nanyang University with the University of Singapore to form the present-day National University of Singapore (NUS). This was a source of significant discontent amongst NU students and alumni, because NU had been a Chinese-medium university, whereas the newly merged NUS was (and is) an English-medium university.

As NTU subsequently grew into a full university, various efforts were made to have it claim the Nanyang University mantle. In 1996, the alumni rolls of Nanyang University were transferred from NUS to NTU. In 1998, the prominent local calligrapher and poet Pan Shou, who had been the first vice-chancellor of Nanyang University, called for NTU to be renamed Nanyang University, as a way to &quot;quieten the hearts of many&quot; NU alumni. In 2003, this idea received further support from NTU president Su Guaning, during an interview with the Chinese-language paper &quot;Lianhe Zaobao&quot;. One reason offered for the renaming was that, by the mid-2000s, NTU no longer had a narrow focus on technical subjects, but had become a full university including studies in the humanities.

===Nanyang Technological Institute (1981–1991)===
In 1980, Nanyang University merged with the University of Singapore to form the current National University of Singapore. Nanyang Technological Institute (NTI), a tertiary institution affiliated to the National University of Singapore, was formed to take over Nanyang University&#x27;s campus in 1981.

Nanyang Technological Institute (NTI) was set up on 1 August 1981 with a charter to train three-quarters of Singapore&#x27;s engineers. The first chairman was Michael Fam, and the first president was Cham Tao Soon. When NTI started in 1982, it had a total student population of 582 in three engineering disciplines – civil and structural, electrical and electronic, and mechanical and production engineering. By 1990, the institute&#x27;s undergraduate student population had grown to 6,832. The first two graduate students were admitted in 1986.

Three engineering schools were added, and the School of Accountancy from the National University of Singapore was transferred to NTI in 1987. A school of applied science was also started. In 1990, the government announced that the Institute of Education would be merged with the College of Physical Education to form the National Institute of Education and that it would be part of the new NTU upon its establishment in 1991.

===Present form===
In 1991, NTI merged with the National Institute of Education (NIE) (founded in 1950) to form the Nanyang Technological University (NTU). The alumni roll of the former Nanyang University were transferred to NTU in 1996. Historically, Nanyang Technological University admitted students jointly with the affiliated National University of Singapore and charged the same fees. Students made only one application, and they would be accepted by either university. This arrangement ended in 2004 as both universities began to distinguish themselves with an end of its official affiliation. Currently, students apply separately to both universities. NTU became autonomous in 2006 and stands as one of the two largest public universities in Singapore today.

NTU is currently a collaborative member of Singapore International Graduate Award for PhD applicants worldwide, which comprises Agency for Science, Technology &amp; Research (A*STAR), the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), the National University of Singapore (NUS) and the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). 

In 2013, there was a debate over academic freedom in Singapore when Cherian George, an outspoken academic at the Wee Kim Wee School of Communications and a government critic, did not get tenured. Although George had been recommended for tenure by the Wee Kim Wee School, his application was turned down by a university-level committee which included representatives from the Government of Singapore. Despite a petition against the tenure decision by students at the Wee Kim Wee School, George&#x27;s appeal against the tenure decision was subsequently rejected by the university.

In 2021, some applications for on-campus hostel accommodations in NTU were rejected due to COVID-19 isolation protocols. The university claimed that the rejections were due to a shortage of housing facilities, which at full capacity was still unable to house every applicant, as rooms were oversubscribed. Such rejections resulted in concerns, especially among international students, as it resulted in many returning second-year students enrolled in for 2020 to 2021 not being granted campus accommodation despite the university&#x27;s much-publicised policy of guaranteeing all incoming students with a minimum of two years of on-campus accommodation. NTU eventually reversed their decision on 2 July 2021, prioritising on-campus accommodations for international students that resided on campus at the time, students under scholarship programmes with guaranteed housing, and all Year 1 and 2 students under the guaranteed hall stay policy.

NTU has a diverse range of students and faculty stemming from distinct foreign nationalities. 65% of faculty and staff are foreign nationals, ranking it 3rd (tied with National University of Singapore) in terms of foreign representation among faculty across the top 100 universities according to QS. It remains one of the few top 100 universities with more than 60% of foreign faculty. Likewise, 31% or 8,089 of students are foreign nationals, with 58% them being post-graduate students. 

== Coat of arms ==
On its foundation in July 1991, NTU adopted the Coat of Arms granted to NTI (by the College of Arms of the United Kingdom in November 1982) as its coat of arms.

The Coat of Arms consists of a heraldic shield divided into two sections: the lower portion shows a stalking lion facing the spectator on a white background and the upper portion two atomic symbols, one on either side of a cog-wheel above a battlement on a red background.

It is blazoned:

 The Learning Hub building, also called the Hive, featured in &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; report, has been designed by a British designer Thomas Heatherwick.

===Yunnan Garden Campus===

The main campus of Nanyang Technological University is the Yunnan Garden Campus () which is situated adjacent to the town of Jurong West. It is the largest university campus on the island of Singapore, housing Singapore&#x27;s largest on-campus residence infrastructure including 23 halls of residence for undergraduates and two graduate halls.

The campus grounds were originally donated by the Singapore Hokkien Association to Nanyang University. In 1981, the Nanyang University grounds were granted to the Nanyang Technological Institute, a newly formed English-medium engineering college. With the formation of the NTU through NTI&#x27;s merger with the National Institute of Education (NIE), the grounds were then presented to the university.

The former Nanyang University administration building was restored into the Chinese Heritage Centre and was gazetted as a national monument in 1998 – now overlooking the Yunnan Garden. As of 2019, the Yunnan Garden is undergoing major renovations that will be completed in 2021. However, some of it has been partially opened to the public in early 2020. The Nanyang University Memorial and original Nanyang University Arch were also declared national monuments of Singapore in 1998. The NTU Art &amp; Heritage Museum is an approved public museum under the National Heritage Board&#x27;s Approved Museum Scheme; benefactors who donate artworks and artefacts to NTU enjoy double tax deductions. There is a small lake between the Chinese Heritage Centre and Hall of Residence 4 called Nanyang Lake. Only members of NTU Anglers&#x27; Club permit holder, the fishing club at NTU, are allowed to fish in this lake.

The campus also served as the Youth Olympic Village for the inaugural Youth Olympic Games in 2010.

=== Novena Campus ===
A third campus, Novena Campus, is situated close to LKCMedicine&#x27;s partner teaching hospital, Tan Tock Seng Hospital in downtown Novena for medical teaching and research at the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine. The new 20-storey Clinical Sciences Building was completed in 2016. The CSB is home to LKCMedicine researchers, with the laboratories interconnected through collaborative spaces.

===Undergraduate halls===
NTU has 23 Halls of Residence for undergraduates, each with a capacity of between 500 and 659 residents. They accommodate 14,000 local and international students, with every freshman guaranteed a hostel room. All halls are co-ed by floor or wing and offer single and double occupancy rooms. Double rooms are shared by residents of the same gender. Every hall has communal facilities like lounges, air-conditioned reading rooms, pantries and laundry rooms with washing machines and dryers. Presently, freshmen students will be guaranteed a room for two years.

<text>The Swatch Group Ltd is a Swiss manufacturer of watches and jewellery. The company was founded in 1983 through the merger of ASUAG and SSIH, moving to manufacturing quartz-crystal watches to resolve the quartz crisis threatening the traditional Swiss watchmaking industry.

The Swatch Group is the largest watch company in the world and employs about 31,000 people in 50 countries. The group owns the Swatch product line and other luxury brands, including Blancpain, Breguet, Certina, ETA, Glashütte Original, Hamilton, Harry Winston, Longines, Mido, Omega, Rado, and Tissot.

== History ==
===SSIH===
SSIH (Société Suisse pour l&#x27;Industrie Horlogère), originated in 1930 with the merger of the Omega and Tissot companies. Swiss watch quality was high, but new technology, such as the Hamilton Electric watch introduced in 1957 and the Bulova Accutron tuning fork watch in 1961, presaged increasing technological competition.

In the late 1970s, SSIH became insolvent due in part to a recession and in part to heavy competition from inexpensive Asian-made quartz crystal watches. These difficulties occurred even though it had become Switzerland&#x27;s largest, and the world&#x27;s third largest, producer of watches. Its creditor banks assumed control in 1981.

===ASUAG===
ASUAG (Allgemeine Gesellschaft der Schweizerischen Uhrenindustrie), formed in 1931, was the world&#x27;s largest producer of watch movements and the parts thereof (balance wheels, balance springs, assortments, watch stones (&quot;jewels&quot;)). ASUAG had also integrated an array of watch brands in 1972 into a sub-holding company, General Watch Co. ASUAG failed similarly in 1982.

===The Swatch Group===
ASUAG/SSIH was formed in 1983 from the two financially troubled predecessor companies, ASUAG and SSIH. Taken private in 1985 by then-CEO Nicolas Hayek, with the understanding of the Swiss banks and the financial assistance of a group of Swiss private investors (in particular Stephan Schmidheiny and Esther Grether), it was renamed SMH (Société de Microélectronique et d&#x27;Horlogerie) in 1986, and ultimately Swatch Group Ltd in 1998.

The &quot;swatch&quot; brand of watch was launched in 1983, by the ETA SA CEO Ernst Thomke and his engineers. The quartz watch was redesigned for manufacturing efficiency and fewer parts, and the styling and design were updated.

== Brands ==

Over the years, the Swatch Group acquired various luxury watchmaking companies, including Blancpain S. A. (founded 1735, bought by Swatch in 1992), Breguet S. A. (founded 1775, bought in 1999), and Glashütte Original (Germany, bought in 2000). The company continued to produce watches under these names.

HW Holding Inc., owner of Harry Winston, Inc., an American jewellery and luxury watch company, was acquired on 26 March 2013 for 711 million Swiss francs. Nayla Hayek became the CEO. The company bought the world&#x27;s biggest flawless blue diamond, The Winston Blue, on 15 May 2014.

The following list includes the brands owned by the Swatch Group:

Current
Discontinued or sold
== Watch manufacturing ==

===ETA movement===
Swatch subsidiary ETA SA, which is based in Grenchen, Switzerland, furnishes many OEM brands, such as LVMH (which markets TAG Heuer, Hublot and Zenith watch lines) and Richemont (which markets amongst others, A. Lange &amp; Söhne, Baume &amp; Mercier, IWC Schaffhausen, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Officine Panerai, Piaget, Roger Dubuis, Vacheron Constantin).

===Electronic systems===
The Swatch Group Electronic System includes:
*&quot;Belenos Clean Power AG&quot;.
* EM Microelectronic-Marin: Designs and produces ultra-low power, low voltage mixed-signal integrated circuits, LCD and modules. IC Product lines include RFID, microcontroller, smart card, ASIC, RTC, reset circuit, watchdog, LCD driver, opto ICs.
* Micro Crystal: produces miniature low power quartz crystals and small low power oscillators.
* Renata: develops and produces micro batteries. Product lines include button cells and rechargeable (Lithium Polymer) batteries.

=== Swatch Internet Time ===
In 1998, Swatch invented &quot;Swatch Internet Time&quot;, intended as a global time system, which divides the day into 1000 &quot;beats&quot; in a single worldwide time zone.

In October 2004, Swatch introduced its first smart watch, the Paparazzi, based on Microsoft Corporation&#x27;s SPOT (Smart Personal Objects Technology.)

=== Watchmaking school ===
The Swatch Group started offering their first class in the &quot;Nicolas G. Hayek Watchmaking School&quot; in Miami, Florida, in September 2005. There are other watchmaking schools in Glashütte, Germany; Pforzheim, Germany; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; and Shanghai, China.

== Sponsorship ==

=== Sport and event timing ===
Swiss Timing, under brands such as Omega, Longines, and Tissot, provide timing services for sporting events such as Formula One, Olympic Games, Tour de France, and equestrian events. In 2018 it was announced that The Swatch Group would hold its own watch fair in Zurich, during Baselworld 2019.

===Ventures===
In 1994, Swatch entered into a joint venture with Germany&#x27;s Daimler AG to produce the &quot;Smart&quot; car, but they later withdrew from this project.

Swatch subsidiary &quot;Belenos Clean Power AG&quot; entered into a joint venture with the Paul Scherrer Institut in May 2008 to develop a hydrogen fuel cell for a fuel cell powered car. Swatch began test drives of the car in Switzerland in 2012. However, the Swatch Group abandoned the project for a fuel-cell-powered car in June 2015, to concentrate instead on a new type of battery with high storage capacity.

<text>Västernorrland County () is a county (&quot;län&quot;) in the north of Sweden. It is bordered by the counties of Gävleborg, Jämtland, Västerbotten and the Gulf of Bothnia.

The name &quot;Västernorrland&quot; means &quot;Western Norrland&quot;, as it was in the western part of the original Norrland (northern Sweden and northern Finland).

== Province ==
&quot;For History, Geography and Culture, see: Ångermanland or Medelpad&quot;

Västernorrland County covers approximately the historical provinces of Ångermanland (Angermannia) and Medelpad.

== Administration ==
The main aim of the county administrative board – a government agency headed by a governor – is to fulfil the goals set out in national politics by the Riksdag and the government, to coordinate the interests of the county, to promote the development of the county, to establish regional goals and safeguard the due process of law in the handling of each case. See List of Västernorrland governors.

== Politics ==
The regional council of Västernorrland is the &quot;&quot;.

== Riksdag elections ==
The table details all Riksdag election results of Västernorrland County since the unicameral era began in 1970. The blocs denote which party would support the Prime Minister or the lead opposition party towards the end of the elected parliament.

== Demographics ==

=== Foreign background ===
SCB have collected statistics on backgrounds of residents since 2002. These tables consist of all who have two foreign-born parents or are born abroad themselves. The chart lists election years and the last year on record alone.

== History ==
Västernorrland County was formed in 1634, when counties were introduced, replacing the older provinces. Västernorrland then included parts of Sweden north of the city of Gävle, except Jämtland and Härjedalen – which belonged to Norway – and except Finland.

The county grew and shrank significantly since its creation. The boundary adjustments:
* Västerbotten County was separated in 1637. 
* Jämtland and Härjedalen joined in 1657, but they both separated as Jämtland County in 1810. 
* Gävleborg County separated in 1762. 
* Other minor changes have taken place.
Even though the name &quot;Västernorrland&quot; literally means &quot;Western Norrland&quot;, it is today situated on the eastern coast of Swedish Norrland. The &quot;west&quot; in its name (&quot;&quot;) arose due to the fact that, at the time, Norrland was a much larger region, including northern Finland as well. Västernorrland was therefore the part of Norrland that lay west of the Baltic Sea, which used to be a Swedish inland sea.

== Heraldry ==
The arms for the County of Västernorrland are a combination of those of Ångermanland and Medelpad. When it is shown with a royal crown, it represents the county administrative board. Blazon: &quot;Parted per pale, the arms of Angermannia and the arms of Medelpad.&quot;

== Miscellaneous topics ==
Local public transport in the county is provided by Din Tur.

<text>The Primal Scream. Primal Therapy: The Cure for Neurosis (1970; second edition 1999) is a book by the psychologist Arthur Janov, in which the author describes his experiences with patients during the months he developed primal therapy. Although Janov&#x27;s claims were questioned by psychologists, the book was popular and brought Janov fame and popular success, which inspired other therapists to start offering primal therapy.

==Summary==
This book gives an account of the development of Primal Therapy. The book starts with an account of a group therapy session in 1967, during which a young man (Danny Wilson) underwent some kind of emotional catharsis during the therapy session. The young man was encouraged by Janov to call out for his mommy and daddy, which he did, only to fall into involuntary convulsions. After which, the young man announced &quot;I can &quot;feel&quot;&quot;, and he then had some kind of emotional resolution.

In the remainder of the book, Janov develops a general theory of neurosis. Janov claims that neurosis is caused by repressed emotional pain from childhood trauma, and can be cured by reliving and expressing. Janov claims in the book that neurosis is caused by repressed childhood emotional trauma, and that reliving is the only effective cure which really addresses the root cause of the problem.

The book contains numerous testimonials but little scientific evidence. The book is based upon Janov&#x27;s theorizing after experimenting with his patients from 1967 to 1970.

==Influence and reception==
&quot;The Primal Scream&quot; was a popular success. It reportedly sold more than one million copies internationally, and was read by tens of thousands of people in the United States. Albert Goldman reported in &quot;The Lives of John Lennon&quot; (1988) that Janov sent pre-publication copies of &quot;The Primal Scream&quot; to celebrities such as John Lennon and Mick Jagger, and that Lennon subsequently underwent primal therapy with Janov, which provided the basis of his first proper solo album, Plastic Ono Band. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Primal Scream&quot; &quot;attracted wide attention in newspapers and magazines&quot; and made Janov a celebrity. The fame and success it brought Janov inspired many therapists who had not met him to offer imitation primal therapy, and led to the proliferation of programs offering happiness through radical personal transformation.

Early reviews in the popular press were mixed. The book critic Robert Kirsch cautioned about Janov&#x27;s &quot;hyperbole&quot; and &quot;evangelic certainty&quot; in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, but nevertheless called him an impressive writer and thinker and concluded that &quot;The Primal Scream&quot; was &quot;worth reading and considering.&quot; &quot;The Primal Scream&quot; was praised by the &quot;Chattanooga Times&quot; and the &quot;Berkeley Gazette&quot;, both of which compared Janov to Freud. However, psychologists immediately questioned the assertions Janov made in the book, pointing out the &quot;unverifiability of its central claim of the existence of primal pain and the lack of independent, controlled studies demonstrating the therapy’s effectiveness&quot;.

Erin Shoemaker criticized Janov&#x27;s ideas about homosexuality in the gay magazine &quot;The Body Politic&quot;, noting that clinical studies contradicted Janov&#x27;s view that girls become lesbians through being seduced by older women and that Janov did not have a clear idea of what constituted &quot;real&quot; behavior. The psychoanalyst Joel Kovel argued in &quot;A Complete Guide to Therapy&quot; (1976) that &quot;The Primal Scream&quot; shows that Janov is one of several figures in the history of psychotherapy who have come to be seen as savior figures. He credited Janov with tapping a &quot;bedrock of great emotional power.&quot; &quot;The Primal Scream&quot; was reviewed in &quot;BMJ&quot; in 2012.

<doc id="82328" wikidata="Q4055" url="?curid=82328" title="Château of Blois">
<text>The Royal Château of Blois (, ) is a château located in the city center of Blois, Loir-et-Cher, in the Loire Valley, France. In addition to having been the residence of the Counts of Blois and some French kings, Joan of Arc also went there by 1429 to be blessed by the Archbishop of Reims before departing with her army to drive against the English, who conquered Orléans the previous year.

The château effectively controlled the County of Blois up to 1397, then the Duchy of Orléans, and the Kingdom of France between 1498 and 1544. It comprises several buildings, whose construction began in the 13th century and ended in the 17th century. Four different architectural styles are represented within the rectangular edifice, including: some remainings of the 13th-century medieval fortress, the Louis XII Gothic-style wing, the Francis I Renaissance-style wing, and the Gaston of Orléans Classical-style wing. In total, there are 564 rooms, including 100 bedrooms with a fireplace in each, and 75 staircases (although only 23 were used frequently).

The Musée des Beaux-Arts de Blois (Museum of Fine Arts of Blois), located in the Louis XII wing, presents collections of painting, sculpture, and decorative arts (including numerous tapestries) dating from the 16th to the 19th century. It was created in 1850.

==History==
===Counts of Blois===
In 854, the Blois castle, known as &quot;Blisum castrum&quot;, was attacked by Viking cheftain Hastein. In the 10th and 11th centuries, the Counts of Blois, who also owned Chartres and Champagne, joined together to rebuild the fortress. Count Theobald I raised a so-called &quot;big tower&quot; and by the end of the 12th century, the Counts&#x27; contributions were finished by building the St-Sauveur Collegiate Church.

The &quot;Estates General Room&quot; (&quot;&quot; in French), built in the beginning of the 13th century, is one of the oldest seignoral rooms preserved in France, and is also the largest remaining civilian Gothic room of the country. This room was used as a court of justice by the Counts of Blois and again in 1576 and 1588 during sessions of the Estates General.

===Transition to the House of Orléans===
The medieval castle was given in 1397 to Louis I, Duke of Orléans, brother of Charles VI. After Louis&#x27; assassination, his widow, Valentina Visconti, retired to the Blois Castle. It was later inherited by their son, Charles d&#x27;Orléans the poet, who was captured at Agincourt and imprisoned in England. After 25 years as a hostage in England, Charles d&#x27;Orleans returned to his beloved Blois and partly helped rebuild the château as a more commodious dwelling. It became the favourite royal residence and the kingdom&#x27;s political capital under Charles&#x27; son, when Count Louis II became King Louis XII of France in 1498.

===King Louis XII===
At the beginning of the 16th century, King Louis XII initiated a reconstruction of the entrance of the main block and the creation of an Italian garden in terraced parterres where Victor Hugo Square stands today.

This wing, of red brick and grey stone, forms the main entrance to a proper château onwards, and features a statue of the mounted king above the entrance. Although the style is principally Gothic, as the profiles of mouldings, the lobed arches and the pinnacles attest, there are elements of Renaissance architecture present, such as a small chandelier.

===King Francis I===
When Francis I became king in 1515, his wife Queen Claude had him refurbish Blois with the intention of moving from the Château d&#x27;Amboise to Blois. Francis initiated the construction of a new wing and created one of the period&#x27;s most important libraries in the castle. After the death of his wife in 1524, he spent very little time at Blois and the massive library was moved to the royal Palace of Fontainebleau. It is this library that formed the royal library and the backbone of the .

Since King Louis XII was very committed in the Italian Wars, which imported the Renaissance movement into Blois, this wing&#x27;s architecture and ornamentation are marked by Italian influence. In the middle, there is the monumental spiral staircase, covered with fine bas-relief sculptures and looking out onto the château&#x27;s central court. These monumental staircases served as a draft for those of the Château de Chambord, built a few years later. Behind this wing is the &quot;Lodges Façade&quot; ( in French), characterised by a series of disconnected niches.

===King Henry III===
Driven from Paris during the French Wars of Religion, King Henry III took refuge in Blois, and summoned Estates General meetings there in 1576 and 1588. On 23 December 1588, the King&#x27;s arch-enemy since the Day of the Barricades, Henry I, Duke of Guise, was assassinated. The following day, the Duke&#x27;s brother, Louis II, Cardinal of Guise was also murdered within the château.

===King Henry IV===
After this, the castle was occupied by King Henry IV, the first Bourbon monarch. On Henry&#x27;s death in 1610, it became the place of exile for his widow, Marie de&#x27; Medici, when she was expelled from the court of her son, King Louis XIII.

===Duke Gaston of Orléans===
In 1626, King Louis XIII gave the county and the Château of Blois to his brother and heir, Gaston, Duke of Orléans as a wedding gift. In 1634, Gaston embarked on building a completely new wing to the château. The task of developing this new castle was given to François Mansart. The rear of the courtyard is where Mansart began this ambitious building project with a main dwelling house. This house should have been the first building in a large-scale reconstruction project. The project was stopped in 1638 when Gaston&#x27;s nephew was born, the future Louis XIV. With Louis XIV&#x27;s birth, Gaston was no longer the heir and no longer eligible for financing.

This wing makes up the rear wall of the court, directly opposite the Louis XII wing. The central section is composed of three horizontal layers where the superposition of Doric, Ionic and Corinthian orders can be seen.

By the time of the French Revolution, the immense castle had been neglected for more than 130 years. The contents, many of its statues, royal emblems and coats of arms of the palace were removed. In a state of near-total disrepair, the Château of Blois was scheduled to be demolished but was given a reprieve as a military barracks.

===Preservation as a monument===
In 1840, the initiative of Prosper Mérimée placed the château on the list of historical monuments. This allowed state funds to be used in the preservation. It was restored under the direction of the architect Félix Duban. 

The château is maintained and owned by the town of Blois and has been opened to the public as a museum and tourist attraction. On view for visitors are the supposed poison cabinets of Catherine de&#x27; Medici. Most likely this room, the &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot;, had a much more banal purpose: exhibiting precious objects for guests.

<text>In electricity generation, a generator is a device that converts motion-based power (potential and kinetic energy) or fuel-based power (chemical energy) into electric power for use in an external circuit. Sources of mechanical energy include steam turbines, gas turbines, water turbines, internal combustion engines, wind turbines and even hand cranks. The first electromagnetic generator, the Faraday disk, was invented in 1831 by British scientist Michael Faraday. Generators provide nearly all the power for electrical grids.

In addition to electricity- and motion-based designs, photovoltaic and fuel cell powered generators use solar power and hydrogen-based fuels, respectively, to generate electrical output. 

The reverse conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy is done by an electric motor, and motors and generators are very similar. Many motors can generate electricity from mechanical energy.

==Terminology==
Electromagnetic generators fall into one of two broad categories, dynamos and alternators.

* Dynamos generate pulsing direct current through the use of a commutator.
* Alternators generate alternating current.

Mechanically, a generator consists of a rotating part and a stationary part which together form a magnetic circuit:

*Rotor: The rotating part of an electrical machine. 
*Stator: The stationary part of an electrical machine, which surrounds the rotor.

One of these parts generates a magnetic field, the other has a wire winding in which the changing field induces an electric current:
*Field winding or field (permanent) magnets: The magnetic field-producing component of an electrical machine. The magnetic field of the dynamo or alternator can be provided by either wire windings called field coils or permanent magnets. Electrically-excited generators include an excitation system to produce the field flux. A generator using permanent magnets (PMs) is sometimes called a magneto, or a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG).
*Armature: The power-producing component of an electrical machine. In a generator, alternator, or dynamo, the armature windings generate the electric current, which provides power to an external circuit. 
The armature can be on either the rotor or the stator, depending on the design, with the field coil or magnet on the other part.

==History==
Before the connection between magnetism and electricity was discovered, electrostatic generators were invented. They operated on electrostatic principles, by using moving electrically charged belts, plates and disks that carried charge to a high potential electrode. The charge was generated using either of two mechanisms: electrostatic induction or the triboelectric effect. Such generators generated very high voltage and low current. Because of their inefficiency and the difficulty of insulating machines that produced very high voltages, electrostatic generators had low power ratings, and were never used for generation of commercially significant quantities of electric power. Their only practical applications were to power early X-ray tubes, and later in some atomic particle accelerators.

===Faraday disk generator===

The operating principle of electromagnetic generators was discovered in the years of 1831–1832 by Michael Faraday. The principle, later called Faraday&#x27;s law, is that an electromotive force is generated in an electrical conductor which encircles a varying magnetic flux.

Faraday also built the first electromagnetic generator, called the Faraday disk; a type of homopolar generator, using a copper disc rotating between the poles of a horseshoe magnet. It produced a small DC voltage.

This design was inefficient, due to self-cancelling counterflows of current in regions of the disk that were not under the influence of the magnetic field. While current was induced directly underneath the magnet, the current would circulate backwards in regions that were outside the influence of the magnetic field. This counterflow limited the power output to the pickup wires and induced waste heating of the copper disc. Later homopolar generators would solve this problem by using an array of magnets arranged around the disc perimeter to maintain a steady field effect in one current-flow direction.

Another disadvantage was that the output voltage was very low, due to the single current path through the magnetic flux. Experimenters found that using multiple turns of wire in a coil could produce higher, more useful voltages. Since the output voltage is proportional to the number of turns, generators could be easily designed to produce any desired voltage by varying the number of turns. Wire windings became a basic feature of all subsequent generator designs.

===Jedlik and the self-excitation phenomenon===
Independently of Faraday, Ányos Jedlik started experimenting in 1827 with the electromagnetic rotating devices which he called electromagnetic self-rotors. In the prototype of the single-pole electric starter (finished between 1852 and 1854) both the stationary and the revolving parts were electromagnetic. It was also the discovery of the principle of dynamo self-excitation, which replaced permanent magnet designs. He also may have formulated the concept of the dynamo in 1861 (before Siemens and Wheatstone) but did not patent it as he thought he was not the first to realize this.

===Direct current generators===


A coil of wire rotating in a magnetic field produces a current which changes direction with each 180° rotation, an alternating current (AC). However many early uses of electricity required direct current (DC). In the first practical electric generators, called &quot;dynamos&quot;, the AC was converted into DC with a &quot;commutator&quot;, a set of rotating switch contacts on the armature shaft. The commutator reversed the connection of the armature winding to the circuit every 180° rotation of the shaft, creating a pulsing DC current. One of the first dynamos was built by Hippolyte Pixii in 1832.

The dynamo was the first electrical generator capable of delivering power for industry. 
The Woolrich Electrical Generator of 1844, now in Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum, is the earliest electrical generator used in an industrial process. It was used by the firm of Elkingtons for commercial electroplating.

The modern dynamo, fit for use in industrial applications, was invented independently by Sir Charles Wheatstone, Werner von Siemens and Samuel Alfred Varley. Varley took out a patent on 24 December 1866, while Siemens and Wheatstone both announced their discoveries on 17 January 1867 by delivering papers at the Royal Society.

The &quot;dynamo-electric machine&quot; employed self-powering electromagnetic field coils rather than permanent magnets to create the stator field. Wheatstone&#x27;s design was similar to Siemens&#x27;, with the difference that in the Siemens design the stator electromagnets were in series with the rotor, but in Wheatstone&#x27;s design they were in parallel. The use of electromagnets rather than permanent magnets greatly increased the power output of a dynamo and enabled high power generation for the first time. This invention led directly to the first major industrial uses of electricity. For example, in the 1870s Siemens used electromagnetic dynamos to power electric arc furnaces for the production of metals and other materials.

The dynamo machine that was developed consisted of a stationary structure, which provides the magnetic field, and a set of rotating windings which turn within that field. On larger machines the constant magnetic field is provided by one or more electromagnets, which are usually called field coils.

Large power generation dynamos are now rarely seen due to the now nearly universal use of alternating current for power distribution. Before the adoption of AC, very large direct-current dynamos were the only means of power generation and distribution. AC has come to dominate due to the ability of AC to be easily transformed to and from very high voltages to permit low losses over large distances.

=== Synchronous generators (alternating current generators) ===
Through a series of discoveries, the dynamo was succeeded by many later inventions, especially the AC alternator, which was capable of generating alternating current. It is commonly known to be the Synchronous Generators (SGs). The synchronous machines are directly connected to the grid and need to be properly synchronized during startup. Moreover, they are excited with special control to enhance the stability of the power system.

Alternating current generating systems were known in simple forms from Michael Faraday&#x27;s original discovery of the magnetic induction of electric current. Faraday himself built an early alternator. His machine was a &quot;rotating rectangle&quot;, whose operation was &quot;heteropolar&quot;: each active conductor passed successively through regions where the magnetic field was in opposite directions.

Large two-phase alternating current generators were built by a British electrician, J. E. H. Gordon, in 1882. The first public demonstration of an &quot;alternator system&quot; was given by William Stanley Jr., an employee of Westinghouse Electric in 1886.

Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti established &quot;Ferranti, Thompson and Ince&quot; in 1882, to market his &quot;Ferranti-Thompson Alternator&quot;, invented with the help of renowned physicist Lord Kelvin. His early alternators produced frequencies between 100 and 300 Hz. Ferranti went on to design the Deptford Power Station for the London Electric Supply Corporation in 1887 using an alternating current system. On its completion in 1891, it was the first truly modern power station, supplying high-voltage AC power that was then &quot;stepped down&quot; for consumer use on each street. This basic system remains in use today around the world.
After 1891, polyphase alternators were introduced to supply currents of multiple differing phases. Later alternators were designed for varying alternating-current frequencies between sixteen and about one hundred hertz, for use with arc lighting, incandescent lighting and electric motors.

===Self-excitation===

As the requirements for larger scale power generation increased, a new limitation rose: the magnetic fields available from permanent magnets. Diverting a small amount of the power generated by the generator to an electromagnetic field coil allowed the generator to produce substantially more power. This concept was dubbed self-excitation.

The field coils are connected in series or parallel with the armature winding. When the generator first starts to turn, the small amount of remanent magnetism present in the iron core provides a magnetic field to get it started, generating a small current in the armature. This flows through the field coils, creating a larger magnetic field which generates a larger armature current. This &quot;bootstrap&quot; process continues until the magnetic field in the core levels off due to saturation and the generator reaches a steady state power output.

Very large power station generators often utilize a separate smaller generator to excite the field coils of the larger. In the event of a severe widespread power outage where islanding of power stations has occurred, the stations may need to perform a black start to excite the fields of their largest generators, in order to restore customer power service.

==Specialised types of generator==

===Direct current (DC)===
A dynamo uses commutators to produce direct current. It is self-excited, i.e. its field electromagnets are powered by the machine&#x27;s own output. Other types of DC generators use a separate source of direct current to energise their field magnets.

====Homopolar generator====

A homopolar generator is a DC electrical generator comprising an electrically conductive disc or cylinder rotating in a plane perpendicular to a uniform static magnetic field. A potential difference is created between the center of the disc and the rim (or ends of the cylinder), the electrical polarity depending on the direction of rotation and the orientation of the field.

It is also known as a unipolar generator, acyclic generator, disk dynamo, or Faraday disc. The voltage is typically low, on the order of a few volts in the case of small demonstration models, but large research generators can produce hundreds of volts, and some systems have multiple generators in series to produce an even larger voltage. They are unusual in that they can produce tremendous electric current, some more than a million amperes, because the homopolar generator can be made to have very low internal resistance.

====Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generator====

A magnetohydrodynamic generator directly extracts electric power from moving hot gases through a magnetic field, without the use of rotating electromagnetic machinery. MHD generators were originally developed because the output of a plasma MHD generator is a flame, well able to heat the boilers of a steam power plant. The first practical design was the AVCO Mk. 25, developed in 1965. The U.S. government funded substantial development, culminating in a 25 MW demonstration plant in 1987. In the Soviet Union from 1972 until the late 1980s, the MHD plant U 25 was in regular utility operation on the Moscow power system with a rating of 25 MW, the largest MHD plant rating in the world at that time. MHD generators operated as a topping cycle are currently (2007) less efficient than combined cycle gas turbines.

===Alternating current (AC)===

====Induction generator====

Induction AC motors may be used as generators, turning mechanical energy into electric current. Induction generators operate by mechanically turning their rotor faster than the simultaneous speed, giving negative slip. A regular AC non-simultaneous motor usually can be used as a generator, without any changes to its parts. Induction generators are useful in applications like minihydro power plants, wind turbines, or in reducing high-pressure gas streams to lower pressure, because they can recover energy with relatively simple controls. They do not require another circuit to start working because the turning magnetic field is provided by induction from the one they have. They also do not require speed governor equipment as they inherently operate at the connected grid frequency.

An induction generator must be powered with a leading voltage; this is usually done by connection to an electrical grid, or by powering themselves with phase correcting capacitors.

====Linear electric generator====

In the simplest form of linear electric generator, a sliding magnet moves back and forth through a solenoid, a copper wire or a coil. An alternating current is induced in the wire, or loops of wire, by Faraday&#x27;s law of induction each time the magnet slides through. This type of generator is used in the Faraday flashlight. Larger linear electricity generators are used in wave power schemes.

====Variable-speed constant-frequency generators====
Grid-connected generators deliver power at a constant frequency. For generators of the synchronous or induction type, the prime mover speed turning the generator shaft must be at a particular speed (or narrow range of speed) to deliver power at the required utility frequency. Mechanical speed-regulating devices may waste a significant fraction of the input energy to maintain a required fixed frequency. 

Where it is impractical or undesired to tightly regulate the speed of the prime mover, doubly fed electric machines may be used as generators. With the assistance of power electronic devices, these can regulate the output frequency to a desired value over a wider range of generator shaft speeds. Alternatively, a standard generator can be used with no attempt to regulate frequency, and the resulting power converted to the desired output frequency with a rectifier and converter combination. Allowing a wider range of prime mover speeds can improve the overall energy production of an installation, at the cost of more complex generators and controls. For example, where a wind turbine operating at fixed frequency might be required to spill energy at high wind speeds, a variable speed system can allow recovery of energy contained during periods of high wind speed.

==Common use cases==
===Power station===


A &quot;power station&quot;, also known as a &quot;power plant&quot; or &quot;powerhouse&quot; and sometimes &quot;generating station&quot; or &quot;generating plant&quot;, is an industrial facility that generates electricity. Most power stations contain one or more generators, or spinning machines converting mechanical power into three-phase electrical power. The relative motion between a magnetic field and a conductor creates an electric current. The energy source harnessed to turn the generator varies widely. Most power stations in the world burn fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas to generate electricity. Cleaner sources include nuclear power, and increasingly use renewables such as the sun, wind, waves and running water.

===Vehicular generators ===

====Roadway vehicles====

Motor vehicles require electrical energy to power their instrumentation, keep the engine itself operating, and recharge their batteries. Until about the 1960s motor vehicles tended to use DC generators (dynamos) with electromechanical regulators. Following the historical trend above and for many of the same reasons, these have now been replaced by alternators with built-in rectifier circuits.

====Bicycles====
Bicycles require energy to power running lights and other equipment. There are two common kinds of generator in use on bicycles: bottle dynamos which engage the bicycle&#x27;s tire on an as-needed basis, and hub dynamos which are directly attached to the bicycle&#x27;s drive train. The name is conventional as they are small permanent-magnet alternators, not self-excited DC machines as are dynamos. Some electric bicycles are capable of regenerative braking, where the drive motor is used as a generator to recover some energy during braking.

====Sailboats====
Sailing boats may use a water- or wind-powered generator to trickle-charge the batteries. A small propeller, wind turbine or turbine is connected to a low-power generator to supply currents at typical wind or cruising speeds.

====Recreational vehicles====
Recreational vehicles need an extra power supply to power their onboard accessories, including air conditioning units, and refrigerators. An RV power plug is connected to the electric generator to obtain a stable power supply.

====Electric scooters====
Electric scooters with regenerative braking have become popular all over the world. Engineers use kinetic energy recovery systems on the scooter to reduce energy consumption and increase its range up to 40-60% by simply recovering energy using the magnetic brake, which generates electric energy for further use. Modern vehicles reach speed up to 25–30 km/h and can run up to 35–40 km.

===Genset===

An &quot;engine-generator&quot; is the combination of an electrical generator and an engine () mounted together to form a single piece of self-contained equipment. The engines used are usually piston engines, but gas turbines can also be used, and there are even hybrid diesel-gas units, called dual-fuel units. Many different versions of engine-generators are available – ranging from very small portable petrol powered sets to large turbine installations. The primary advantage of engine-generators is the ability to independently supply electricity, allowing the units to serve as backup power sources.

===Human powered electrical generators===

A generator can also be driven by human muscle power (for instance, in field radio station equipment).
Human powered electric generators are commercially available, and have been the project of some DIY enthusiasts. Typically operated by means of pedal power, a converted bicycle trainer, or a foot pump, such generators can be practically used to charge batteries, and in some cases are designed with an integral inverter. An average &quot;healthy human&quot; can produce a steady 75 watts (0.1 horsepower) for a full eight hour period, while a &quot;first class athlete&quot; can produce approximately 298 watts (0.4 horsepower) for a similar period, at the end of which an undetermined period of rest and recovery will be required. At 298 watts, the average &quot;healthy human&quot; becomes exhausted within 10 minutes. The net electrical power that can be produced will be less, due to the efficiency of the generator. Portable radio receivers with a crank are made to reduce battery purchase requirements, see clockwork radio. During the mid 20th century, pedal powered radios were used throughout the Australian outback, to provide schooling (School of the Air), medical and other needs in remote stations and towns.

===Mechanical measurement===
A tachogenerator is an electromechanical device which produces an output voltage proportional to its shaft speed. It may be used for a speed indicator or in a feedback speed control system. Tachogenerators are frequently used to power tachometers to measure the speeds of electric motors, engines, and the equipment they power. Generators generate voltage roughly proportional to shaft speed. With precise construction and design, generators can be built to produce very precise voltages for certain ranges of shaft speeds.

==Equivalent circuit==
An equivalent circuit of a generator and load is shown in the adjacent diagram. The generator is represented by an abstract generator consisting of an ideal voltage source and an internal impedance. The generator&#x27;s formula_1 and formula_2 parameters can be determined by measuring the winding resistance (corrected to operating temperature), and measuring the open-circuit and loaded voltage for a defined current load.

This is the simplest model of a generator, further elements may need to be added for an accurate representation. In particular, inductance can be added to allow for the machine&#x27;s windings and magnetic leakage flux, but a full representation can become much more complex than this.

<text>Oak Island is a privately owned island in Lunenburg County on the south shore of Nova Scotia, Canada. The tree-covered island is one of several islands in Mahone Bay, and is connected to the mainland by a causeway. The nearest community is the rural community of Western Shore which faces the island, while the nearest village is Chester. The island is best known for various theories about buried treasure or historical artifacts, and the associated attempts to explore the site.

==Geography==
===Climate===
The majority of Nova Scotia is a humid continental climate with hot and humid summers, and cold or frigid winters. While there is no weather station on the island or along Mahone Bay, there is one towards the west in the town of Bridgewater. The average annual temperature given in Bridgewater is , while the precipitation runs at . The island and surrounding coasts can be hidden in fog for as many as 90 days a year. These coasts are also vulnerable to powerful storms which include nor&#x27;easters and hurricanes.

===Ecology===
Oak Island is made up of a temperate broadleaf and mixed forest, known regionally as the New England/Acadian forests. Wildlife in the Mahone Bay area includes great blue herons, black guillemots, osprey, Leach&#x27;s storm petrels, and razorbills. Non-specific eagles and puffins are also mentioned. The roseate tern is considered an endangered species in the area and is protected by the Canadian government. Efforts to restore their habitat, such as curbing the population of other bird species, have been undertaken.

===Geology===
The geology of Oak Island was first mapped in 1924 by J. W. Goldthwait of the Geological Survey of Canada, who interpreted the island as a composite of four drumlins. These drumlins are &quot;elongated hills&quot; which consist of multiple layers of till resting on bedrock and are from different phases of glacial advance that span the past 75,000 years. The layers on top of the bedrock are mainly made up of &quot;Lawrencetown&quot; and slate till. The former of these two is considered a type of clay till which is made up of 50% sand, 30% silt, and 20% clay. In the main area that has been searched for treasure along with the till lie bits of anhydrite which become more competent deeper down. Researchers Les MacPhie, and John Wonnacott concluded that the deep deposits at the east end of the Island make up the drumlin formations.

There are two types of bedrock that lie under Oak Island; the southeastern portion consists of &quot;Mississippian Windsor Group limestone&quot; and gypsum, and the northwestern part is Cambro-Ordovician Halifax Formation slate. Oak Island and the area that is now Mahone Bay was once a lagoon 8,000 years BP, before the sea level rose with the melting glaciers. Dr. Ian Spooner of Acadia University has stated that the current triangular swamp on Oak Island was once a cove. Analysis done of core samples taken from the swamp show that a &quot;significant saltwater intrusion&quot; occurred as recently as the late 1300s or early 1400s. While Spooner said that this was likely from &quot;human manipulation&quot;, he did not rule out the possibility of an enormous storm.

==Human history==

The first known indigenous people in Nova Scotia are the Mi&#x27;kmaq, who have lived in present-day Nova Scotia and Newfoundland for several thousand years. The area that encompasses Oak Island was once known as the &quot;Segepenegatig&quot; region. While it is unknown when Europeans first encountered Oak Island, the earliest confirmed European residents date back to the 1750s when French fishermen built a few houses on the future site of the nearby village of Chester. Following the Expulsion of the Acadians during the Seven Years&#x27; War, the British authorities encouraged British colonists from New England to settle in Nova Scotia. Land was made available to settlers in 1759 through the Shorham grant, and Chester was officially founded that same year.

The first major group of settlers arrived in the Chester area from Massachusetts in 1761, and Oak Island was officially surveyed and divided into 32 four-acre lots in the following year. A large part of the island was owned at the time by the Monro, Lynch, Seacombe, and Young families who had been granted the land in 1759. In the early days of British settlement, the island was known locally as &quot;Smith&#x27;s Island,&quot; after an early settler of the area named Edward Smith. Cartographer Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres renamed the island &quot;Gloucester Isle&quot; in 1778. Shortly thereafter, the locally used name &quot;Oak Island&quot; was officially adopted for the Island. Early residents included Edward Smith in the 1760s and Anthony Vaughn Sr. in the early 1770s. In 1784, the government made additional land grants, this time to former soldiers, which included parts of Oak Island. It was not until July 6, 1818, that the original lot owners&#x27; names were mapped for the Nova Scotia Crown Lands office. Oak Island has been intermittently owned by treasure hunters ever since old legends were first published in 1857. The hunt for treasure got so extensive that in 1965 a causeway was built from the western end of the island to Crandall&#x27;s Point on the mainland, two hundred metres away in order to bring heavy machinery onto the island.

The most recent owners include a treasure hunter named Dan Blankenship, who initially partnered with &quot;Oak Island Tours Inc.,&quot; run by David Tobias. Oak Island Tours eventually dissolved, and in February 2019 it was announced that a new partnership had been formed with a company called the &quot;Michigan Group&quot;. This group consisted of brothers Rick and Marty Lagina, Craig Tester, and Alan Kostrzewa who had been purchasing lots from Tobias. Blankenship owned the island with the Michigan Group until his death on March 17, 2019, at the age of 95.

Oak Island is populated on a seasonal basis with two permanent homes and two cottages being occupied part-time. While the island remains private property, public access is granted to those who schedule tours ahead of time.

== Oak Island mystery ==
Oak Island has been a subject for treasure hunters ever since the late 1700s, with rumours that Captain Kidd&#x27;s treasure was buried there. While there is little evidence to support what went on during the early excavations, stories began to be published and documented as early as 1856. Since that time there have been many theories that extend beyond that of Captain Kidd which include stories of religious artifacts, manuscripts, and Marie Antoinette&#x27;s jewels. The &quot;treasure&quot; has also been prone to criticism by those who have dismissed search areas as natural phenomena.

Areas of interest on the island with regard to treasure hunters include a location known as the &quot;Money Pit&quot;, which is allegedly the original searchers’ spot. Located on the east side of Oak Island, the Money Pit is—or was—a shaft more than deep. According to island lore, it first drew the attention of a local teenager in 1795, who noticed an indentation in the ground and, with some friends, started to dig—only to find a man-made shaft featuring wooden platforms every down to the level of depth.

There is also a formation of boulders called &quot;Nolan&#x27;s Cross&quot;, named after a former treasure hunter, and a triangle-shaped swamp. Lastly, there has been activity on a beach at a place called &quot;Smith&#x27;s Cove&quot;. Various objects including non-native coconut fibre have been found there. More recent archaeological discoveries in the Smith&#x27;s Cove area have included an allegedly pre-15th-century lead cross and various wooden earthworks.

More than fifty books have been published recounting the island&#x27;s history and exploring competing theories. Several works of fiction have also been based upon the Money Pit, including &quot;The Money Pit Mystery&quot;, &quot;Riptide&quot;, &quot;The Hand of Robin Squires&quot;, and &quot;Betrayed: The Legend of Oak Island&quot;. In January 2014, the History Channel began airing a reality TV show called &quot;The Curse of Oak Island&quot; about a group of modern treasure hunters. These hunters include brothers Rick and Marty Lagina of the &quot;Michigan Group&quot;. The series has documented finds such as centuries-old coins, an antique brooch, and a lead cross that was allegedly made between 1200 and 1600 A.D.

<text>The Mason–Dixon line is a demarcation line separating four U.S. states: Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware and West Virginia. It was surveyed between 1763 and 1767 by Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon as part of the resolution of a border dispute involving Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Delaware in the colonial United States. 

The largest portion of the Mason–Dixon line, along the southern Pennsylvania border, later became informally known as the boundary between the Southern slave states and Northern free states. This usage came to prominence during the debate around the Missouri Compromise of 1820, when drawing boundaries between slave and free territory and resurfaced during the American Civil War, with border states also coming into play. The Confederate States of America claimed the Virginia (now West Virginia) portion of the line as part of its northern border, although it never exercised meaningful control that far northespecially after West Virginia separated from Virginia and joined the Union as a separate state in 1863. It is still used today in the figurative sense of a line that separates the Northeast and South culturally, politically, and socially .

==Background==
Maryland&#x27;s charter of 1632 granted Cecil Calvert land north of the entire length of the Potomac River up to the 40th parallel. A problem arose when Charles II granted a charter for Pennsylvania in 1681. The grant defined Pennsylvania&#x27;s southern border as identical to Maryland&#x27;s northern border, but described it differently, as Charles relied on an inaccurate map. The terms of the grant clearly indicate that Charles II and William Penn believed the 40th parallel would intersect the Twelve-Mile Circle around New Castle, Delaware, when in fact it falls north of the original boundaries of the City of Philadelphia, the site of which Penn had already selected for his colony&#x27;s capital city. Negotiations ensued after the problem was discovered in 1681. A compromise proposed by Charles II in 1682, which might have resolved the issue, was undermined by Penn receiving the additional grant of the &quot;Three Lower Counties&quot; along Delaware Bay, which later became the Delaware Colony, a satellite of Pennsylvania. Maryland considered these lands part of its original grant.

The conflict became more of an issue when settlement extended into the interior of the colonies. In 1732, the Proprietary Governor of Maryland, Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore, signed a provisional agreement with William Penn&#x27;s sons, which drew a line somewhere in between and renounced the Calvert claim to Delaware. But later, Lord Baltimore claimed that the document he had signed did not contain the terms he had agreed to, and refused to put the agreement into effect. Beginning in the mid-1730s, violence erupted between settlers claiming various loyalties to Maryland and Pennsylvania. The border conflict would be known as Cresap&#x27;s War.

Progress was made after a Court of Chancery ruling affirming the 1732 agreement, but the issue remained unresolved until Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore ceased contesting the claims on the Maryland side and accepted the earlier agreements. Maryland&#x27;s border with Delaware was to be based on the Transpeninsular Line and the Twelve-Mile Circle around New Castle. The Pennsylvania–Maryland border was defined as the line of latitude south of the southernmost house in Philadelphia (on what is today South Street). As part of the settlement, the Penns and Calverts commissioned the English team of Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon to survey the newly established boundaries between the Province of Pennsylvania, the Province of Maryland, and Delaware Colony.

In 1779, Pennsylvania and Virginia agreed &quot;To extend Mason&#x27;s and Dixon&#x27;s line, due west, five degrees of longitude, to be computed from the river Delaware, for the southern boundary of Pennsylvania, and that a meridian, drawn from the western extremity thereof to the northern limit of the said state, be the western boundary of Pennsylvania for ever.&quot;

After Pennsylvania abolished slavery in 1781, the east–west part of this line and the Ohio River became a border between slave and free states, with Delaware retaining slavery until the 13th Amendment was ratified in 1865.

==Geography of the line==
Mason and Dixon&#x27;s actual survey line began to the south of Philadelphia, and extended from a benchmark east to the Delaware River and west to what was then the boundary with western Virginia.

The surveyors also fixed the boundary between Delaware and Pennsylvania and the approximately north–south portion of the boundary between Delaware and Maryland. Most of the Delaware–Pennsylvania boundary is an arc, and the Delaware–Maryland boundary does not run truly north–south because it was intended to bisect the Delmarva Peninsula rather than follow a meridian.

Mason and Dixon also confirmed the earlier survey delineating Delaware&#x27;s southern boundary from the Atlantic Ocean to the &quot;Middle Point&quot; stone (along what is today known as the &quot;Transpeninsular Line&quot;). They proceeded nearly due north from this to the Pennsylvania border.

The Maryland–Pennsylvania boundary is an east–west line with an approximate mean latitude of 39°43′20″ N (Datum WGS 84). In reality, the east-west Mason–Dixon line is not a true straight line in the geometric sense, but is instead a polygonal chain, a series of many adjoining line segments, following a path between latitude 39°43′15″ N and 39°43′23″ N.

The surveyors also extended the boundary line west of Maryland&#x27;s western boundary, into territory that was still in dispute between Pennsylvania and Virginia, though this was contrary to their original charter. Mason and Dixon&#x27;s survey was finished on October 19, 1767, about east of what is now Pennsylvania&#x27;s southwest corner. Where the surveyors finished their survey became known as the Mason and Dixon Survey Terminal Point

In 1774, commissioners from Pennsylvania and Virginia met to negotiate their boundary, which at the time involved Pennsylvania&#x27;s southern border west of Maryland and its entire western border. Both sides agreed that Pennsylvania&#x27;s grant made its western border a tracing of the course of the Delaware River, displaced five degrees (approximately 265 miles) to the west. And both sides thought this would place Fort Pitt in Virginia territory (in fact it would not have). With that in mind, the governor of Pennsylvania argued that, despite the agreement reached with Maryland, Pennsylvania&#x27;s southern border west of Maryland was still the 39th parallel, about south of the Mason–Dixon line. Negotiations continued for five years, with a series of proposed lines. In the end, a compromise was reached: the Mason–Dixon line would be extended west to a point five degrees west of the Delaware River. To compensate Pennsylvania for the claimed territory lost, its western boundary would be run due north rather than copying the course of the Delaware River.

The Mason–Dixon line was marked by stones every mile and &quot;crownstones&quot; every , using stone shipped from England. The Maryland side says &quot;(M)&quot; and the Delaware and Pennsylvania sides say &quot;(P)&quot;.
Crownstones included both coats of arms.

Many of the original stones are still visible, resting on public land and protected by iron cages; a number have gone missing or were buried.

The actual locations of the stones may differ a few hundred feet east or west from the exact positions where Mason and Dixon intended to place them, still, the line drawn from stone to stone forms the legal boundary.

The lines have been resurveyed several times over the centuries without substantive changes to Mason&#x27;s and Dixon&#x27;s work, and additional benchmarks and survey markers were placed where necessary.

==History==

The line was established to end a boundary dispute between the British colonies of Maryland and Pennsylvania/Delaware. Maryland had been granted the territory north of the Potomac River up to the 40th parallel. Pennsylvania&#x27;s grant defined the colony&#x27;s southern boundary as following a 12-mile (radius) circle () counter-clockwise from the Delaware River until it hit &quot;the beginning of the fortieth degree of Northern latitude.&quot; From there the boundary was to follow the 40th parallel due west for five degrees of longitude. But the 40th parallel does not, in fact, intersect the 12-mile circle, instead lying significantly farther north. Thus Pennsylvania&#x27;s southern boundary as defined in its charter was contradictory and unclear. The most serious problem was that the Maryland claim would put Philadelphia, the largest city in Pennsylvania, in Maryland.

The dispute was peacefully resolved in 1767 when the boundary was fixed as follows:
* Between Pennsylvania and Maryland:
** The parallel (latitude line) south of the then southernmost point in Philadelphia, measured to be at about 39°43′ N and agreed upon as the Maryland–Pennsylvania line.
* Between Delaware and Maryland:
** The existing east–west transpeninsular line from the Atlantic Ocean to the Chesapeake Bay, as far as its midpoint from the Atlantic.
** A 12-mile (radius) circle () around the city of New Castle, Delaware.
** A &quot;tangent line&quot; connecting the midpoint of the transpeninsular line to the western side of the 12-mile circle.
** A &quot;north line&quot; along the meridian (line of longitude) from the tangent point to the Maryland-Pennsylvania border.
** Should any land within the 12-mile circle fall west of the north line, it would remain part of Delaware. (This was indeed the case, and this border is the &quot;arc line&quot;.)

The disputants engaged an expert British team, astronomer Charles Mason and surveyor Jeremiah Dixon, to survey what became known as the Mason–Dixon line. It cost the Calverts of Maryland and the Penns of Pennsylvania £3,512 9/ – () to have surveyed with such accuracy. To them the money was well spent, for in a new country there was no other way of establishing ownership.
The Mason-Dixon Trail stretches on or near Pennsylvania&#x27;s border with Delaware and Maryland and is a popular attraction to tourists.

The Mason–Dixon line is made up of four segments corresponding to the terms of the settlement:
* the tangent line
* the north line
* the arc line
* the 39°43′ N parallel

The most difficult task was fixing the tangent line, as they had to confirm the accuracy of the transpeninsular line midpoint and the 12-mile circle, determine the tangent point along the circle, and then actually survey and monument the border. They then surveyed the north and arc lines. They did this work between 1763 and 1767. This actually left a small wedge of land in dispute between Delaware and Pennsylvania until 1921.

In April 1765, Mason and Dixon began their survey of the more famous Maryland–Pennsylvania line. They were commissioned to run it for a distance of five degrees of longitude west from the Delaware River, fixing the western boundary of Pennsylvania (see the entry for Yohogania County). However, in October 1767, at Dunkard Creek near Mount Morris, Pennsylvania, nearly west of the Delaware, their Iroquois guides refused to go any further, having reached the border of their lands with the Lenape, with whom they were engaged in hostilities. As a result, the group was forced to quit, and on October 11, they made their final observations, from their starting point.

In 1784, surveyors David Rittenhouse and Andrew Ellicott and their crew completed the survey of the Mason–Dixon line to the southwest corner of Pennsylvania, five degrees from the Delaware River. Other surveyors continued west to the Ohio River. The section of the line between the southwestern corner of Pennsylvania and the river is the county line between Marshall and Wetzel counties, West Virginia.

As the 20th century moved along and modern roadways came to northeastern Maryland and Delaware, the old boundary line was noted by construction crews, newspaper columnists, and the traveling public. When contractors started working on a section of Route 40, a modern dual highway between Elkton and Glasgow, they discovered a time and weather battered original Mason Dixon Marker. It was relocated to northside of the highway and when the governors of Delaware and Maryland dedicated the highway on June 26, 1941, newspaper reporters took note of the ancient old relic.

Although greatly mangled by traffic in the second half of the twentieth century, it still stands today. But long before bulldozers and other heavy equipment started moving earth for the dual highway before World War II, there were concerns about the preservation of this monument. In 1885, the Cecil Democrat reported that after 119-years, the stone on the road from Elkton to Glasgow had &quot;yielded to the action of the elements and fell over.&quot; The editor urged the Cecil County Commissioners, Commissioner of the Land Office, Governor or some public minded citizen to preserve this &quot;old time-honored, moss-covered relic of a generation, which has passed away. . . &quot;

On November 14, 1963, during the bicentennial of the Mason–Dixon line, U.S. President John F. Kennedy opened a newly completed section of Interstate 95 where it crossed the Maryland–Delaware border. After the president, flanked by the governors of Delaware and Maryland, cut a ribbon opening the Interstate, they moved to the grassy median strip where a replica Mason and Dixon Marker had been placed for the bicentennial. There President Kennedy and the governors unveiled a limestone replica. It was one of his last public appearances before his assassination in Dallas, Texas. The Delaware Turnpike and the Maryland portion of the new road were later designated as the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway.

The Mason–Dixon line has been resurveyed three times: in 1849, 1900, and in the 1960s.

In 2020, 30 volunteers, at the behest of the Maryland Geological Survey, started a project to locate and document the 226 remaining Mason-Dixon Line stones, which were placed every mile in the 18th century to mark the border between Pennsylvania and Maryland. The stones are historically significant because they represent one of the first geodetic surveys ever conducted in North America. The volunteers hope to get the stones listed on the National Register of Historic Places, which will help to preserve them for future generations. By 2023, the volunteers found 218 of the often-hidden 500-pound limestone stone markers quarried in England.

==Systematic errors and experiments to weigh the Earth==
Mason and Dixon achieved a high level of accuracy in the survey due to the work of Nevil Maskelyne, some of whose instruments they used. There was keen interest in their work and much communication between the surveyors, Maskelyne and other members of the British Scientific establishment in the Royal Society in Britain, notably Henry Cavendish.

During such survey work, it is normal to survey from point to point along the line and then survey back to the starting point, where if there were no errors the origin and re-surveyed position would coincide. Normally the return errors would be randomi.e. the return survey errors compared to the intermediate points back to the start point would be spatially randomly distributed around the start point. Mason and Dixon found that there were larger than expected systematic errors, i.e. non-random errors, that led the return survey consistently being in one direction away from the starting point.

When this information got back to the Royal Society members, Henry Cavendish realised that this may have been due to the gravitational pull of the Allegheny Mountains deflecting the theodolite plumb-bobs and spirit levels toward them to the west. Maskelyne then proposed measuring the gravitational force causing this deflection induced by the pull of a nearby mountain upon a plumb-bob in 1772 and sent Mason (who had returned to Britain) on a site survey through central England and Scotland to find a suitable location during the summer of 1773. Mason selected Schiehallion at which to conduct what became known as the Schiehallion experiment, which was carried out primarily by Maskelyne and determined the density of the Scottish mountain. Several years later Cavendish used a very sensitive torsion balance to carry out the Cavendish experiment and determine the average density of Earth.

==In culture==

===Name===
It is unlikely that Mason and Dixon ever heard the phrase &quot;Mason–Dixon line&quot;. The official report on the survey, issued in 1768, did not even mention their names. While the term was used occasionally in the decades following the survey, it came into popular use during congressional debates on the Missouri Compromise named &quot;Mason and Dixon&#x27;s line&quot; as part of the boundary between slave territory and free territory.

===Symbolism===
In popular usage to people from the United States, the Mason–Dixon line symbolizes a cultural boundary between the North and the South (Dixie). Originally &quot;Mason and Dixon&#x27;s Line&quot; simply referred to the border between Pennsylvania (including &quot;the Delaware Counties&quot;) and Maryland. However, it has been used metaphorically to describe the entire boundary between slave and free states during the 19th-century. After Pennsylvania abolished slavery, it served as a demarcation line for the legality of slavery. Technically, that demarcation did not extend beyond Pennsylvania where Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware, all slave states, lay south or east of the boundary. Also lying north and east of the boundary was New Jersey, where slavery was formally abolished in 1846, but former slaves continued to be &quot;apprenticed&quot; to their masters until the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1865.

The Missouri Compromise line (Parallel 36°30′ north) had a much clearer geographic connection to slavery in the United States leading up to the Civil War.

===In popular culture===

Popular culture contains a multitude of references to the Mason–Dixon line as a general geographic division, or character names evoking it, although a minority of those specifically relate to the line itself.

====Film====
* Mason &quot;The Line&quot; Dixon is a leading character in &quot;Rocky Balboa&quot; (2006), the sixth film in the Rocky franchise, directed by and starring Sylvester Stallone. Played by real-life boxer Antonio Tarver, Dixon is the current World Heavyweight Boxing Champion who is ridiculed for having never fought a real contender, and who thus agrees to an exhibition fight against the nearly 60-year-old Rocky Balboa.
* In &quot;Attack of the Killer Tomatoes&quot; (1978), Mason Dixon is the leader of a government task force dedicated to stopping the worldwide crisis when tomatoes turn malignant.

====Cartoons====
* The line makes several appearances in the 1953 Bugs Bunny cartoon &quot;Southern Fried Rabbit&quot;. The line separates the drought-affected North from which the &quot;Yankee&quot; Bugs leaves in search of carrots in the green lands of the &quot;Dixie&quot; South, the latter being guarded by Yosemite Sam, who thinks the Civil War is still ongoing.

====Literature====
* In the novel &quot;People&#x27;s Choice&quot; by Jeff Greenfield, the character of W. Dixon Mason is an African-American preacher who plays a major role in determining the next U.S. president when the elected candidate dies between the popular election and the Electoral College formal vote.
* &quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot; (1997) is the title of a novel by American author Thomas Pynchon. The novel meanders widely through the lives of Mason and Dixon, traditional American history, and other themes such as hollow earth theory, geomancy, deism, andperhapsalien abduction.

====Music====
* The 1918 song, &quot;Rock-a-Bye Your Baby with a Dixie Melody&quot;, written by Jean Schwartz, Sam M. Lewis, and Joe Young, popularized by Al Jolson, includes the lyric &quot;Just hang my cradle, Mammy mine/ Right on that Mason–Dixon Line&quot;.
* A small group of musicians from Paul Whiteman&#x27;s orchestra led by C melody saxophonist Frank Trumbauer and including Bix Beiderbecke recorded two sides for Columbia on May 15, 1929, titled, &quot;Alabammy Snow&quot; and &quot;What A Day!&quot; under the pseudonym, &quot;Mason–Dixon Orchestra&quot;. It is probable that they chose this pseudonym because the catalog number of the record would be 1861-D, 1861 being the year that the American Civil War began.
* The lyric &quot;First to cross the Mason–Dixon line&quot; featured in the opening verse of the song &quot;I&#x27;ve Done it Again&quot; (composers Marianne Faithfull / Barry Reynolds) on Grace Jones&#x27; 1981 album &quot;Nightclubbing&quot;.
* The 1955 song, &quot;Hey, Porter&quot;, by Johnny Cash makes reference to the Mason–Dixon line in the line, &quot;How much longer will it be &#x27;til we cross that Mason-Dixon line?&quot;
* From the 2000 album &quot;Sailing to Philadelphia&quot; by British singer-songwriter and guitarist Mark Knopfler, the title track (also featuring James Taylor) is about the two English surveyors Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon travelling to Philadelphia to survey the Mason–Dixon line; the lyrics draw from &quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot; by Thomas Pynchon, a novel about their relationship.
* Sonic Youth&#x27;s &quot;Paper Cup Exit&quot; from the album &quot;Sonic Nurse&quot; (2004) has the line &quot;Touch down on the new Mason-Dixon line&quot; (sung by Lee Ranaldo)
* Dan Seals sang &quot;Mason Dixon line&quot; and the song symbolically references the line.
* GZA references the &quot;Mason-Dixon Line&quot; in the closing words of his feature verse on Raekwon&#x27;s song &quot;Guillotine (Swords)&quot; from his debut 1995 album &quot;Only Built 4 Cuban Linx&quot;.
* Tom Lehrer references the Mason–Dixon line in his song &quot;I Wanna Go Back to Dixie&quot;.
* Lady Antebellum&#x27;s eponymous album has a song &quot;Home Is Where The Heart Is&quot;, which contains the line &quot;It&#x27;s just south of the Mason-Dixon line&quot;.
* The 1916 song &quot;Are You from Dixie (&#x27;Cause I&#x27;m from Dixie Too)&quot; originally recorded by Billy Murray contains the lyrics &quot;If you&#x27;re from Alabama, Tennessee, or Caroline. Any place below the Mason-Dixon line. Then you&#x27;re from Dixie.&quot;
* Brad Paisley, LL Cool J, and Lee Thomas Miller&#x27;s controversial 2013 song &quot;Accidental Racist&quot; uses the Mason–Dixon line as a metaphor for north–south, black/white, and other cultural (dysfunctional) relations: &quot;Oh, Dixieland/The relationship between the Mason-Dixon needs some fixin&#x27;&quot;
* David Allan Coe sings about the Mason–Dixon line in &quot;I Still Sing the Old Songs&quot;.
* Connie Smith sings about the Mason–Dixon Line in &quot;Cincinnati, Ohio&quot;, with lyrics by Bill Anderson.
* The 1983 song Dixieland Delight by country singer Ronnie Rogers and recorded by American country music band Alabama references the Mason-Dixon Line multiple times throughout the song.
* The country band Mason Dixon
* The 2022 song, &quot;Before&quot; which is included in the album Nicole, written by NIKI includes the lyric &quot;While you stay just fine and feel alive south of the Mason-Dixon line&quot;.
* In Kathy Mattea&#x27;s 1986 song &quot;Leaving West Virginia&quot;, she is leaving her home state for California in search of success, but indicates that &quot;I&#x27;ll surely leave my heart below the Mason-Dixon line&quot;.
* The 2008 song &quot;Ruby and Carlos&quot; by James McMurtry from the album &quot;Just Us Kids&quot; opens with the lines &quot;Ruby said you&#x27;re getting us in of world of hurt, Down below the Mason-Dumbass line the food gets worse&quot;

====Sports====
* In the regional baseball rivalry between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox, the theoretical border that separates population centers that are majority-Red Sox fans from majority-Yankees fans in Connecticut is sometimes called the &quot;Munson-Nixon Line&quot;, in a (somewhat parodic) reference to the Mason–Dixon line. Credited to Steve Rushin of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, the line is named for famed Yankee catcher Thurman Munson and Red Sox right fielder Trot Nixon. In the book &quot;The Nine Nations of North America&quot;, this line is mentioned (but not named) as the true marker of whether a given location in Connecticut is socially part of New England or the rust belt region the author calls The Foundry. This line has moved over the years, but it&#x27;s still there.

<text>The Château d&#x27;Angers is a castle in the city of Angers in the Loire Valley, in the &quot;département&quot; of Maine-et-Loire, in France. Founded in the 9th century by the Counts of Anjou, it was expanded to its current size in the 13th century. It is located overhanging the River Maine. It is a listed historical monument since 1875. Now open to the public, the Château d&#x27;Angers is home of the Apocalypse Tapestry.

==History==
Originally, the Château d&#x27;Angers was built as a fortress at a site inhabited by the Romans because of its strategic defensive location.

In the 9th century, the Bishop of Angers gave the Counts of Anjou permission to build a castle in Angers. The construction of the first castle begun under Count Fulk III (970–1040), celebrated for his construction of dozens of castles, who built it to protect Anjou from the Normans. It became part of the Angevin Empire of the Plantagenet Kings of England during the 12th century. In 1204, the region was conquered by Philip II and the new castle was constructed during the minority of his grandson, Louis IX (&quot;Saint Louis&quot;) in the early part of the 13th century. Louis IX rebuilt the castle in whitestone and black slate, with 17 semicircular towers. The construction undertaken in 1234 cost 4,422 livres, roughly one per cent of the estimated royal revenue at the time. Louis gave the castle to his brother, Charles in 1246.

In 1352, King John II, gave the castle to his second son, Louis who later became count of Anjou. Married to the daughter of the wealthy Charles, Duke of Brittany, Louis had the castle modified, and in 1373 commissioned the famous &quot;Apocalypse Tapestry&quot; from the painter Hennequin de Bruges and the Parisian tapestry-weaver Nicolas Bataille. Louis II (Louis I&#x27;s son) and Yolande d&#x27;Aragon added a chapel (1405–12) and royal apartments to the complex. The chapel is a &quot;sainte chapelle&quot;, the name given to churches which enshrined a relic of the Passion. The relic at Angers was a splinter of the fragment of the True Cross which had been acquired by Louis IX.

In the early 15th century, the hapless dauphin who, with the assistance of Joan of Arc would become King Charles VII, had to flee Paris and was given sanctuary at the Château d&#x27;Angers.
In 1562, Catherine de&#x27; Medici had the castle restored as a powerful fortress, but, her son, Henry III, reduced the height of the towers and had the towers and walls stripped of their embattlements; Henry III used the castle stones to build streets and develop the village of Angers. Nonetheless, under threat of attacks from the Huguenots, the king maintained the castle&#x27;s defensive capabilities by making it a military outpost and by installing artillery on the château&#x27;s upper terraces. At the end of the 18th century, as a military garrison, it showed its worth when its thick walls withstood a massive bombardment by cannons from the Vendean army. Unable to do anything else, the rebels simply gave up.

A military academy was established in the castle to train young officers in the strategies of war. Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, best known for defeating Napoleon Bonaparte at the Battle of Waterloo, was trained at the Military Academy of Angers. The academy was moved to Saumur and the castle was used for the rest of the 19th century as a prison, powder magazine, and barracks.

==Modern==

The castle continued to be used as an armory through the First and Second World Wars. It was severely damaged during World War II by the Nazis when an ammunition storage dump inside the castle exploded.

On 10 January 2009, the castle suffered severe damage from an accidental fire due to short-circuiting. The Royal Logis, which contains old tomes and administrative offices, was the most heavily damaged part of the château, resulting in of the roof being completely burnt. The Tapestries of the Apocalypse were not damaged. Total damages were estimated at 2 million Euros. According to Christine Albanel, the Minister of Culture, the expected date of completion for the restoration was the second trimester of 2009.

Today, owned by the City of Angers, the massive, austere castle has been converted to a museum housing the oldest and largest collection of medieval tapestries in the world, with the 14th-century &quot;Apocalypse Tapestry&quot; as one of its priceless treasures. As a tribute to its fortitude, the castle has never been taken by any invading force in history.

==Layout==

The outer wall is thick, extends for about and is protected by seventeen massive towers. Each of the perimeter towers measures in diameter. The château covers an area of . Two pairs of towers form the city and landward entrances of the château. Each of the towers was once in height, but they were later cut down for the use of artillery pieces. The Tour du Moulin is the only tower which conserves the original elevation.

<doc id="82341" wikidata="Q188804" url="?curid=82341" title="Factorization">
<text>In mathematics, factorization (or factorisation, see English spelling differences) or factoring consists of writing a number or another mathematical object as a product of several &quot;factors&quot;, usually smaller or simpler objects of the same kind. For example, is an &quot;integer factorization&quot; of , and is a &quot;polynomial factorization&quot; of .

Factorization is not usually considered meaningful within number systems possessing division, such as the real or complex numbers, since any formula_1 can be trivially written as formula_2 whenever formula_3 is not zero. However, a meaningful factorization for a rational number or a rational function can be obtained by writing it in lowest terms and separately factoring its numerator and denominator.

Factorization was first considered by ancient Greek mathematicians in the case of integers. They proved the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which asserts that every positive integer may be factored into a product of prime numbers, which cannot be further factored into integers greater than 1. Moreover, this factorization is unique up to the order of the factors. Although integer factorization is a sort of inverse to multiplication, it is much more difficult algorithmically, a fact which is exploited in the RSA cryptosystem to implement public-key cryptography.

Polynomial factorization has also been studied for centuries. In elementary algebra, factoring a polynomial reduces the problem of finding its roots to finding the roots of the factors. Polynomials with coefficients in the integers or in a field possess the unique factorization property, a version of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic with prime numbers replaced by irreducible polynomials. In particular, a univariate polynomial with complex coefficients admits a unique (up to ordering) factorization into linear polynomials: this is a version of the fundamental theorem of algebra. In this case, the factorization can be done with root-finding algorithms. The case of polynomials with integer coefficients is fundamental for computer algebra. There are efficient computer algorithms for computing (complete) factorizations within the ring of polynomials with rational number coefficients (see factorization of polynomials).

A commutative ring possessing the unique factorization property is called a unique factorization domain. There are number systems, such as certain rings of algebraic integers, which are not unique factorization domains. However, rings of algebraic integers satisfy the weaker property of Dedekind domains: ideals factor uniquely into prime ideals.

&quot;Factorization&quot; may also refer to more general decompositions of a mathematical object into the product of smaller or simpler objects. For example, every function may be factored into the composition of a surjective function with an injective function. Matrices possess many kinds of matrix factorizations. For example, every matrix has a unique LUP factorization as a product of a lower triangular matrix with all diagonal entries equal to one, an upper triangular matrix , and a permutation matrix ; this is a matrix formulation of Gaussian elimination.

==Integers==
By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, every integer greater than 1 has a unique (up to the order of the factors) factorization into prime numbers, which are those integers which cannot be further factorized into the product of integers greater than one.

For computing the factorization of an integer , one needs an algorithm for finding a divisor of or deciding that is prime. When such a divisor is found, the repeated application of this algorithm to the factors and gives eventually the complete factorization of .

For finding a divisor of , if any, it suffices to test all values of such that and . In fact, if is a divisor of such that , then is a divisor of such that .

If one tests the values of in increasing order, the first divisor that is found is necessarily a prime number, and the &quot;cofactor&quot; cannot have any divisor smaller than . For getting the complete factorization, it suffices thus to continue the algorithm by searching a divisor of that is not smaller than and not greater than .

There is no need to test all values of for applying the method. In principle, it suffices to test only prime divisors. This needs to have a table of prime numbers that may be generated for example with the sieve of Eratosthenes. As the method of factorization does essentially the same work as the sieve of Eratosthenes, it is generally more efficient to test for a divisor only those numbers for which it is not immediately clear whether they are prime or not. Typically, one may proceed by testing 2, 3, 5, and the numbers &gt; 5, whose last digit is 1, 3, 7, 9 and the sum of digits is not a multiple of 3.

This method works well for factoring small integers, but is inefficient for larger integers. For example, Pierre de Fermat was unable to discover that the 6th Fermat number 
: formula_4
is not a prime number. In fact, applying the above method would require more than , for a number that has 10 decimal digits.

There are more efficient factoring algorithms. However they remain relatively inefficient, as, with the present state of the art, one cannot factorize, even with the more powerful computers, a number of 500 decimal digits that is the product of two randomly chosen prime numbers. This ensures the security of the RSA cryptosystem, which is widely used for secure internet communication.

===Example===
For factoring into primes:
* Start with division by 2: the number is even, and . Continue with 693, and 2 as a first divisor candidate. 
* 693 is odd (2 is not a divisor), but is a multiple of 3: one has and . Continue with 231, and 3 as a first divisor candidate.
* 231 is also a multiple of 3: one has , and thus . Continue with 77, and 3 as a first divisor candidate.
* 77 is not a multiple of 3, since the sum of its digits is 14, not a multiple of 3. It is also not a multiple of 5 because its last digit is 7. The next odd divisor to be tested is 7. One has , and thus . This shows that 7 is prime (easy to test directly). Continue with 11, and 7 as a first divisor candidate. 
* As , one has finished. Thus 11 is prime, and the prime factorization is 

==Expressions==
Manipulating expressions is the basis of algebra. Factorization is one of the most important methods for expression manipulation for several reasons. If one can put an equation in a factored form , then the problem of solving the equation splits into two independent (and generally easier) problems and . When an expression can be factored, the factors are often much simpler, and may thus offer some insight on the problem. For example,
:formula_5
having 16 multiplications, 4 subtractions and 3 additions, may be factored into the much simpler expression 
:formula_6 
with only two multiplications and three subtractions. Moreover, the factored form immediately gives roots &quot;x&quot; = &quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot; as the roots of the polynomial.

On the other hand, factorization is not always possible, and when it is possible, the factors are not always simpler. For example, formula_7 can be factored into two irreducible factors formula_8 and formula_9.

Various methods have been developed for finding factorizations; some are described below.

Solving algebraic equations may be viewed as a problem of polynomial factorization. In fact, the fundamental theorem of algebra can be stated as follows: every polynomial in of degree with complex coefficients may be factorized into linear factors formula_10 for , where the s are the roots of the polynomial. Even though the structure of the factorization is known in these cases, the
s generally cannot be computed in terms of radicals (&quot;n&quot;th roots), by the Abel–Ruffini theorem. In most cases, the best that can be done is computing approximate values of the roots with a root-finding algorithm.

===History of factorization of expressions===

The systematic use of algebraic manipulations for simplifying expressions (more specifically equations) may be dated to 9th century, with al-Khwarizmi&#x27;s book &quot;The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing&quot;, which is titled with two such types of manipulation.

However, even for solving quadratic equations, the factoring method was not used before Harriot&#x27;s work published in 1631, ten years after his death. In his book &quot;Artis Analyticae Praxis ad Aequationes Algebraicas Resolvendas&quot;, Harriot drew tables for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of monomials, binomials, and trinomials. Then, in a second section, he set up the equation , and showed that this matches the form of multiplication he had previously provided, giving the factorization .

===General methods===
The following methods apply to any expression that is a sum, or that may be transformed into a sum. Therefore, they are most often applied to polynomials, though they also may be applied when the terms of the sum are not monomials, that is, the terms of the sum are a product of variables and constants.

====Common factor====
It may occur that all terms of a sum are products and that some factors are common to all terms. In this case, the distributive law allows factoring out this common factor. If there are several such common factors, it is preferable to divide out the greatest such common factor. Also, if there are integer coefficients, one may factor out the greatest common divisor of these coefficients.

For example,
formula_11
since 2 is the greatest common divisor of 6, 8, and 10, and formula_12 divides all terms.

====Grouping====
Grouping terms may allow using other methods for getting a factorization.

For example, to factor 
formula_13
one may remark that the first two terms have a common factor , and the last two terms have the common factor . Thus
formula_14
Then a simple inspection shows the common factor , leading to the factorization 
formula_15

In general, this works for sums of 4 terms that have been obtained as the product of two binomials. Although not frequently, this may work also for more complicated examples.

====Adding and subtracting terms====
Sometimes, some term grouping reveals part of a recognizable pattern. It is then useful to add and subtract terms to complete the pattern.

A typical use of this is the completing the square method for getting the quadratic formula.

Another example is the factorization of formula_16 If one introduces the non-real square root of –1, commonly denoted , then one has a difference of squares
formula_17
However, one may also want a factorization with real number coefficients. By adding and subtracting formula_18 and grouping three terms together, one may recognize the square of a binomial:
formula_19
Subtracting and adding formula_20 also yields the factorization:
formula_21
These factorizations work not only over the complex numbers, but also over any field, where either –1, 2 or –2 is a square. In a finite field, the product of two non-squares is a square; this implies that the polynomial formula_22 which is irreducible over the integers, is reducible modulo every prime number. For example,
formula_23
formula_24since formula_25
formula_26since formula_27
formula_28since formula_29

===Recognizable patterns===
Many identities provide an equality between a sum and a product. The above methods may be used for letting the sum side of some identity appear in an expression, which may therefore be replaced by a product.

Below are identities whose left-hand sides are commonly used as patterns (this means that the variables and that appear in these identities may represent any subexpression of the expression that has to be factorized). 

*;Difference of two squares
::formula_30
:For example,
:::formula_31
*;Sum/difference of two cubes
::formula_32
::formula_33
:*;Cauchy identity
:::formula_34
:::formula_35
*;Difference of two fourth powers
::formula_36
*;Sum/difference of two th powers
:In the following identities, the factors may often be further factorized:
:*;Difference, even exponent
::formula_37
:*;Difference, even or odd exponent
::formula_38
::This is an example showing that the factors may be much larger than the sum that is factorized.
:*;Sum, odd exponent
::formula_39
::(obtained by changing by in the preceding formula)

====Roots of unity====
The th roots of unity are the complex numbers each of which is a root of the polynomial formula_50 They are thus the numbers 
formula_51
for formula_52

It follows that for any two expressions and , one has:
formula_53
formula_54
formula_55

If and are real expressions, and one wants real factors, one has to replace every pair of complex conjugate factors by its product. As the complex conjugate of formula_56 is formula_57 and 
formula_58
one has the following real factorizations (one passes from one to the other by changing into or , and applying the usual trigonometric formulas:
formula_59
formula_60

The cosines that appear in these factorizations are algebraic numbers, and may be expressed in terms of radicals (this is possible because their Galois group is cyclic); however, these radical expressions are too complicated to be used, except for low values of . For example,
formula_61
formula_62
formula_63

Often one wants a factorization with rational coefficients. Such a factorization involves cyclotomic polynomials. To express rational factorizations of sums and differences or powers, we need a notation for the homogenization of a polynomial: if formula_64 its &quot;homogenization&quot; is the bivariate polynomial formula_65 Then, one has
formula_66
formula_67
where the products are taken over all divisors of , or all divisors of that do not divide , and formula_68 is the th cyclotomic polynomial.

For example, 
formula_69
formula_70
since the divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6, and the divisors of 12 that do not divide 6 are 4 and 12.

==Polynomials==

For polynomials, factorization is strongly related with the problem of solving algebraic equations. An algebraic equation has the form
:formula_71
where is a polynomial in with formula_72
A solution of this equation (also called a root of the polynomial) is a value of such that
:formula_73

If formula_74 is a factorization of as a product of two polynomials, then the roots of are the union of the roots of and the roots of . Thus solving is reduced to the simpler problems of solving and .

Conversely, the factor theorem asserts that, if is a root of , then may be factored as
:formula_75
where is the quotient of Euclidean division of by the linear (degree one) factor .

If the coefficients of are real or complex numbers, the fundamental theorem of algebra asserts that has a real or complex root. Using the factor theorem recursively, it results that
:formula_76
where formula_77 are the real or complex roots of , with some of them possibly repeated. This complete factorization is unique up to the order of the factors.

If the coefficients of are real, one generally wants a factorization where factors have real coefficients. In this case, the complete factorization may have some quadratic (degree two) factors. This factorization may easily be deduced from the above complete factorization. In fact, if is a non-real root of , then its complex conjugate is also a root of . So, the product 
:formula_78
is a factor of with real coefficients. Repeating this for all non-real factors gives a factorization with linear or quadratic real factors.

For computing these real or complex factorizations, one needs the roots of the polynomial, which may not be computed exactly, and only approximated using root-finding algorithms.

In practice, most algebraic equations of interest have integer or rational coefficients, and one may want a factorization with factors of the same kind. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic may be generalized to this case, stating that polynomials with integer or rational coefficients have the unique factorization property. More precisely, every polynomial with rational coefficients may be factorized in a product
:formula_79
where is a rational number and formula_80 are non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients that are irreducible and primitive; this means that none of the formula_81 may be written as the product two polynomials (with integer coefficients) that are neither 1 nor –1 (integers are considered as polynomials of degree zero). Moreover, this factorization is unique up to the order of the factors and the signs of the factors.

There are efficient algorithms for computing this factorization, which are implemented in most computer algebra systems. See Factorization of polynomials. Unfortunately, these algorithms are too complicated to use for paper-and-pencil computations. Besides the heuristics above, only a few methods are suitable for hand computations, which generally work only for polynomials of low degree, with few nonzero coefficients. The main such methods are described in next subsections.

===Primitive-part &amp; content factorization===
Every polynomial with rational coefficients, may be factorized, in a unique way, as the product of a rational number and a polynomial with integer coefficients, which is primitive (that is, the greatest common divisor of the coefficients is 1), and has a positive leading coefficient (coefficient of the term of the highest degree). For example:
:formula_82
:formula_83

In this factorization, the rational number is called the content, and the primitive polynomial is the primitive part. The computation of this factorization may be done as follows: firstly, reduce all coefficients to a common denominator, for getting the quotient by an integer of a polynomial with integer coefficients. Then one divides out the greater common divisor of the coefficients of this polynomial for getting the primitive part, the content being formula_84 Finally, if needed, one changes the signs of and all coefficients of the primitive part.

This factorization may produce a result that is larger than the original polynomial (typically when there are many coprime denominators), but, even when this is the case, the primitive part is generally easier to manipulate for further factorization.

===Using the factor theorem===
The factor theorem states that, if is a root of a polynomial
:formula_85
meaning , then there is a factorization 
:formula_75
where 
:formula_87
with formula_88. Then polynomial long division or synthetic division give:
:formula_89
This may be useful when one knows or can guess a root of the polynomial.

For example, for formula_90 one may easily see that the sum of its coefficients is 0, so is a root. As , and formula_91 one has 
:formula_92

===Rational roots===
For polynomials with rational number coefficients, one may search for roots which are rational numbers. Primitive part-content factorization (see above) reduces the problem of searching for rational roots to the case of polynomials with integer coefficients having no non-trivial common divisor.

If formula_93 is a rational root of such a polynomial 
:formula_85
the factor theorem shows that one has a factorization
:formula_95
where both factors have integer coefficients (the fact that has integer coefficients results from the above formula for the quotient of by formula_96).

Comparing the coefficients of degree and the constant coefficients in the above equality shows that, if formula_97 is a rational root in reduced form, then is a divisor of formula_98 and is a divisor of formula_99 Therefore, there is a finite number of possibilities for and , which can be systematically examined.

For example, if the polynomial 
:formula_100
has a rational root formula_97 with , then must divide 6; that is formula_102 and must divide 2, that is formula_103 Moreover, if , all terms of the polynomial are negative, and, therefore, a root cannot be negative. That is, one must have 
:formula_104
A direct computation shows that only formula_105 is a root, so there can be no other rational root. Applying the factor theorem leads finally to the factorization
formula_106

====Quadratic ac method====
The above method may be adapted for quadratic polynomials, leading to the &quot;ac method&quot; of factorization.

Consider the quadratic polynomial 
:formula_107
with integer coefficients. If it has a rational root, its denominator must divide evenly and it may be written as a possibly reducible fraction formula_108 By Vieta&#x27;s formulas, the other root formula_109 is
:formula_110
with formula_111
Thus the second root is also rational, and Vieta&#x27;s second formula formula_112 gives
:formula_113
that is 
:formula_114
Checking all pairs of integers whose product is gives the rational roots, if any.

In summary, if formula_115 has rational roots there are integers and such formula_116 and formula_117 (a finite number of cases to test), and the roots are formula_118 and formula_119 In other words, one has the factorization
:formula_120

For example, let consider the quadratic polynomial
:formula_121
Inspection of the factors of leads to , giving the two roots 
:formula_122

and the factorization 
:formula_123

===Using formulas for polynomial roots===
Any univariate quadratic polynomial formula_124 can be factored using the quadratic formula:
:formula_125
where formula_126 and formula_127 are the two roots of the polynomial.

If are all real, the factors are real if and only if the discriminant formula_128 is non-negative. Otherwise, the quadratic polynomial cannot be factorized into non-constant real factors.

The quadratic formula is valid when the coefficients belong to any field of characteristic different from two, and, in particular, for coefficients in a finite field with an odd number of elements.

There are also formulas for roots of cubic and quartic polynomials, which are, in general, too complicated for practical use. The Abel–Ruffini theorem shows that there are no general root formulas in terms of radicals for polynomials of degree five or higher.

===Using relations between roots===
It may occur that one knows some relationship between the roots of a polynomial and its coefficients. Using this knowledge may help factoring the polynomial and finding its roots. Galois theory is based on a systematic study of the relations between roots and coefficients, that include Vieta&#x27;s formulas.

Here, we consider the simpler case where two roots formula_129
and formula_130 of a polynomial formula_131 satisfy the relation
:formula_132
where is a polynomial.

This implies that formula_129 is a common root of formula_134 and formula_135 It is therefore a root of the greatest common divisor of these two polynomials. It follows that this greatest common divisor is a non constant factor of formula_135 Euclidean algorithm for polynomials allows computing this greatest common factor.

For example, if one know or guess that:
formula_137 
has two roots that sum to zero, one may apply Euclidean algorithm to formula_131 and formula_139 The first division step consists in adding formula_131 to formula_141 giving the remainder of 
:formula_142
Then, dividing formula_131 by formula_144 gives zero as a new remainder, and as a quotient, leading to the complete factorization
:formula_145

==Unique factorization domains==

The integers and the polynomials over a field share the property of unique factorization, that is, every nonzero element may be factored into a product of an invertible element (a unit, ±1 in the case of integers) and a product of irreducible elements (prime numbers, in the case of integers), and this factorization is unique up to rearranging the factors and shifting units among the factors. Integral domains which share this property are called unique factorization domains (UFD).

Greatest common divisors exist in UFDs, but not every integral domain in which greatest common divisors exist (known as a GCD domain) is a UFD. Every principal ideal domain is a UFD.

A Euclidean domain is an integral domain on which is defined a Euclidean division similar to that of integers. Every Euclidean domain is a principal ideal domain, and thus a UFD.

In a Euclidean domain, Euclidean division allows defining a Euclidean algorithm for computing greatest common divisors. However this does not imply the existence of a factorization algorithm. There is an explicit example of a field such that there cannot exist any factorization algorithm in the Euclidean domain of the univariate polynomials over .

==Ideals==

In algebraic number theory, the study of Diophantine equations led mathematicians, during 19th century, to introduce generalizations of the integers called algebraic integers. The first ring of algebraic integers that have been considered were Gaussian integers and Eisenstein integers, which share with usual integers the property of being principal ideal domains, and have thus the unique factorization property.

Unfortunately, it soon appeared that most rings of algebraic integers are not principal and do not have unique factorization. The simplest example is formula_146 in which
:formula_147
and all these factors are irreducible.

This lack of unique factorization is a major difficulty for solving Diophantine equations. For example, many wrong proofs of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem (probably including Fermat&#x27;s &quot;truly marvelous proof of this, which this margin is too narrow to contain&quot;) were based on the implicit supposition of unique factorization.

This difficulty was resolved by Dedekind, who proved that the rings of algebraic integers have unique factorization of ideals: in these rings, every ideal is a product of prime ideals, and this factorization is unique up the order of the factors. The integral domains that have this unique factorization property are now called Dedekind domains. They have many nice properties that make them fundamental in algebraic number theory.

==Matrices==

Matrix rings are non-commutative and have no unique factorization: there are, in general, many ways of writing a matrix as a product of matrices. Thus, the factorization problem consists of finding factors of specified types. For example, the LU decomposition gives a matrix as the product of a lower triangular matrix by an upper triangular matrix. As this is not always possible, one generally considers the &quot;LUP decomposition&quot; having a permutation matrix as its third factor.

See Matrix decomposition for the most common types of matrix factorizations.

A logical matrix represents a binary relation, and matrix multiplication corresponds to composition of relations. Decomposition of a relation through factorization serves to profile the nature of the relation, such as a difunctional relation.

<text>A lymph node, or lymph gland, is a kidney-shaped organ of the lymphatic system and the adaptive immune system. A large number of lymph nodes are linked throughout the body by the lymphatic vessels. They are major sites of lymphocytes that include B and T cells. Lymph nodes are important for the proper functioning of the immune system, acting as filters for foreign particles including cancer cells, but have no detoxification function.

In the lymphatic system, a lymph node is a secondary lymphoid organ. A lymph node is enclosed in a fibrous capsule and is made up of an outer cortex and an inner medulla.

Lymph nodes become inflamed or enlarged in various diseases, which may range from trivial throat infections to life-threatening cancers. The condition of lymph nodes is very important in cancer staging, which decides the treatment to be used and determines the prognosis. Lymphadenopathy refers to glands that are enlarged or swollen. When inflamed or enlarged, lymph nodes can be firm or tender.

== Structure ==

Lymph nodes are kidney or oval shaped and range in size from 2 mm to 25 mm on their long axis, with an average of 15 mm.

Each lymph node is surrounded by a fibrous capsule (made of collagenous connective tissue), which extends inside a lymph node to form trabeculae. The substance of a lymph node is divided into the outer &quot;cortex&quot; and the inner &quot;medulla&quot;. These are rich with cells. The hilum is an indent on the concave surface of the lymph node where lymphatic vessels leave and blood vessels enter and leave.

Lymph enters the convex side of a lymph node through multiple afferent lymphatic vessels, and from there, it flows into a series of sinuses. Upon entering the lymph node, lymph first passes into a space beneath the capsule known as the subcapsular sinus, then moves into the cortical sinuses. After traversing the cortex, lymph collects in the medullary sinuses. Finally, all of these sinuses drain into the efferent lymphatic vessels, which carry the lymph away from the node, exiting at the hilum on the concave side.

=== Location ===

Lymph nodes are present throughout the body, are more concentrated near and within the trunk, and are divided into groups. There are about 450 lymph nodes in the adult. Some lymph nodes can be felt when enlarged (and occasionally when not), such as the axillary lymph nodes under the arm, the cervical lymph nodes of the head and neck and the inguinal lymph nodes near the groin crease. Most lymph nodes lie within the trunk adjacent to other major structures in the body - such as the paraaortic lymph nodes and the tracheobronchial lymph nodes. The lymphatic drainage patterns are different from person to person and even asymmetrical on each side of the same body.

There are no lymph nodes in the central nervous system, which is separated from the body by the blood–brain barrier. Lymph from the meningeal lymphatic vessels in the CNS drains to the deep cervical lymph nodes. However, the CNS does innervate lymph node by sympathetic nerves.  These regulate lymphocyte proliferation and migration, antibody secretion, blood perfusion, and inflammatory cytokine production.

===Size===
===Subdivisions===

A lymph node is divided into compartments called &quot;nodules&quot; (or lobules), each consisting of a region of cortex with combined follicle B cells, a paracortex of T cells, and a part of the nodule in the medulla. The substance of a lymph node is divided into the outer &quot;cortex&quot; and the inner &quot;medulla&quot;. The cortex of a lymph node is the outer portion of the node, underneath the capsule and the subcapsular sinus. It has an outer part and a deeper part known as the &quot;paracortex&quot;. The outer cortex consists of groups of mainly inactivated B cells called follicles. When activated, these may develop into what is called a germinal centre. The deeper paracortex mainly consists of the T cells. Here the T-cells mainly interact with dendritic cells, and the reticular network is dense.

The medulla contains large blood vessels, sinuses and medullary cords that contain antibody-secreting plasma cells. There are fewer cells in the medulla.

The medullary cords are cords of lymphatic tissue, and include plasma cells, macrophages, and B cells.

=== Cells ===
In the lymphatic system a lymph node is a secondary lymphoid organ. Lymph nodes contain lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, and are primarily made up of B cells and T cells. B cells are mainly found in the outer cortex where they are clustered together as follicular B cells in lymphoid follicles, and T cells and dendritic cells are mainly found in the &quot;paracortex&quot;.

There are fewer cells in the medulla than the cortex. The medulla contains plasma cells, as well as macrophages which are present within the medullary sinuses.

As part of the reticular network, there are follicular dendritic cells in the B cell follicle and fibroblastic reticular cells in the T cell cortex. The reticular network provides structural support and a surface for adhesion of the dendritic cells, macrophages and lymphocytes. It also allows exchange of material with blood through the high endothelial venules and provides the growth and regulatory factors necessary for activation and maturation of immune cells.

=== Lymph flow ===

Lymph enters the convex side of a lymph node through multiple afferent lymphatic vessels, which form a network of lymphatic vessels () and flows into a space () underneath the capsule called the subcapsular sinus. From here, lymph flows into sinuses within the cortex. After passing through the cortex, lymph then collects in medullary sinuses. All of these sinuses drain into the efferent lymphatic vessels to exit the node at the hilum on the concave side.

These are channels within the node lined by endothelial cells along with fibroblastic reticular cells, allowing for the smooth flow of lymph. The endothelium of the subcapsular sinus is continuous with that of the afferent lymph vessel and also with that of the similar sinuses flanking the trabeculae and within the cortex. These vessels are smaller and do not allow the passage of macrophages so that they remain contained to function within a lymph node. In the course of the lymph, lymphocytes may be activated as part of the adaptive immune response.

There is usually only one efferent vessel though sometimes there may be two, in contrast to the multiple afferent channels that bring lymph into the node. Medullary sinuses contain histiocytes (immobile macrophages) and reticular cells, the former of which, along with T and B cells, become activated in the presence of antigens through lymphatic flow. The fewer efferent vessels allow this flow to be slowed, providing time to activate and distribute a larger number of immune cells in the event of an infection.

A lymph node contains lymphoid tissue, i.e., a meshwork or fibers called &#x27; with white blood cells enmeshed in it. The regions where there are few cells within the meshwork are known as &#x27;. It is lined by reticular cells, fibroblasts and fixed macrophages.

===Capsule===

Thin reticular fibers (reticulin) of reticular connective tissue form a supporting meshwork inside the node.
These reticular cells also form a conduit network within the lymph node that functions as a molecular sieve, to prevent pathogens that enter the lymph node through afferent vessels re-enter the blood stream. The lymph node capsule is composed of dense irregular connective tissue with some plain collagenous fibers, and a number of membranous processes or trabeculae extend from its internal surface. The trabeculae pass inward, radiating toward the center of the node, for about one-third or one-fourth of the space between the circumference and the center of the node. In some animals they are sufficiently well-marked to divide the peripheral or cortical portion of the node into a number of compartments (nodules), but in humans this arrangement is not obvious. The larger trabeculae springing from the capsule break up into finer bands, and these interlace to form a mesh-work in the central or medullary portion of the node. These trabecular spaces formed by the interlacing trabeculae contain the proper lymph node substance or lymphoid tissue. The node pulp does not, however, completely fill the spaces, but leaves between its outer margin and the enclosing trabeculae a channel or space of uniform width throughout. This is termed the subcapsular sinus (lymph path or lymph sinus). Running across it are a number of finer trabeculae of reticular fibers, mostly covered by ramifying cells.

===Inverted Lymph Node===
Some mammal species, such as pigs, rhinoceroses, hippopotamuses, and certain cetaceans, have so-called &quot;inverted&quot; lymph nodes. In these nodes, the afferent lymph carries antigens from the center (where the B-cell follicles are located) toward the periphery. Mature B and T lymphocytes exit the lymph node from its periphery directly into the general bloodstream via efferent venules. These structural differences do not appear to impact the functionality of the lymph nodes.

== Function ==
In the lymphatic system, a lymph node is a secondary lymphoid organ. 
The primary function of lymph nodes is the filtering of lymph to identify and fight infection. In order to do this, lymph nodes contain lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, which includes B cells and T cells. These circulate through the bloodstream and enter and reside in lymph nodes. B cells produce antibodies. Each antibody has a single predetermined target, an antigen, that it can bind to. These circulate throughout the bloodstream and if they find this target, the antibodies bind to it and stimulate an immune response. Each B cell produces different antibodies, and this process is driven in lymph nodes. B cells enter the bloodstream as &quot;naive&quot; cells produced in bone marrow. After entering a lymph node, they then enter a lymphoid follicle, where they multiply and divide, each producing a different antibody. If a cell is stimulated, it will go on to produce more antibodies (a plasma cell) or act as a memory cell to help the body fight future infection. If a cell is not stimulated, it will undergo apoptosis and die.

Antigens are molecules found on bacterial cell walls, chemical substances secreted from bacteria, or sometimes even molecules present in body tissue itself. These are taken up by cells throughout the body called antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells. These antigen presenting cells enter the lymph system and then lymph nodes. They present the antigen to T cells and, if there is a T cell with the appropriate T cell receptor, it will be activated.

B cells acquire antigen directly from the afferent lymph. If a B cell binds its cognate antigen it will be activated. Some B cells will immediately develop into antibody secreting plasma cells, and secrete IgM. Other B cells will internalize the antigen and present it to follicular helper T cells on the B and T cell zone interface. If a cognate FTh cell is found it will upregulate CD40L and promote somatic hypermutation and isotype class switching of the B cell, increasing its antigen binding affinity and changing its effector function. Proliferation of cells within a lymph node will make the node expand.

Lymph is present throughout the body, and circulates through lymphatic vessels. These drain into and from lymph nodesafferent vessels drain into nodes, and efferent vessels from nodes. When lymph fluid enters a node, it drains into the node just beneath the capsule in a space called the subcapsular sinus. The subcapsular sinus drains into trabecular sinuses and finally into medullary sinuses. The sinus space is criss-crossed by the pseudopods of macrophages, which act to trap foreign particles and filter the lymph. The medullary sinuses converge at the hilum and lymph then leaves the lymph node via the &quot;efferent lymphatic vessel&quot; towards either a more central lymph node or ultimately for drainage into a central venous subclavian blood vessel.
* The B cells migrate to the nodular cortex and medulla.
* The T cells migrate to the deep cortex. This is a region of a lymph node called the paracortex that immediately surrounds the medulla. Because both naive T cells and dendritic cells express CCR7, they are drawn into the paracortex by the same chemotactic factors, increasing the chance of T cell activation. Both B and T lymphocytes enter lymph nodes from circulating blood through specialized high endothelial venules found in the paracortex.

==Clinical significance==
===Swelling===
Lymph node enlargement or swelling is known as lymphadenopathy. Swelling may be due to many causes, including infections, tumors, autoimmune disease, drug reactions, diseases such as amyloidosis and sarcoidosis, or because of lymphoma or leukemia. Depending on the cause, swelling may be painful, particularly if the expansion is rapid and due to an infection or inflammation. Lymph node enlargement may be localized to an area, which might suggest a local source of infection or a tumour in that area that has spread to the lymph node. It may also be generalized, which might suggest infection, connective tissue or autoimmune disease, or a malignancy of blood cells such as a lymphoma or leukemia. Rarely, depending on location, lymph node enlargement may cause problems such as difficulty breathing, or compression of a blood vessel (for example, superior vena cava obstruction).

Enlarged lymph nodes might be felt as part of a medical examination, or found on medical imaging. Features of the medical history may point to the cause, such as the speed of onset of swelling, pain, and other constitutional symptoms such as fevers or weight loss. For example, a tumour of the breast may result in swelling of the lymph nodes under the arms and weight loss and night sweats may suggest a malignancy such as lymphoma.

In addition to a medical exam by a medical practitioner, medical tests may include blood tests and scans may be needed to further examine the cause. A biopsy of a lymph node may also be needed.

===Cancer===

Lymph nodes can be affected by both primary cancers of lymph tissue, and secondary cancers affecting other parts of the body. Primary cancers of lymph tissue are called lymphomas and include Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Cancer of lymph nodes can cause a wide range of symptoms from painless long-term slowly growing swelling to sudden, rapid enlargement over days or weeks, with symptoms depending on the grade of the tumour. Most lymphomas are tumours of B-cells. Lymphoma is managed by haematologists and oncologists.

Local cancer in many parts of the body can cause lymph nodes to enlarge because of tumorous cells that have metastasised into the node. Lymph node involvement is often a key part in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, acting as &quot;sentinels&quot; of local disease, incorporated into TNM staging and other cancer staging systems. As part of the investigations or workup for cancer, lymph nodes may be imaged or even surgically removed. If removed, the lymph node will be stained and examined under a microscope by a pathologist to determine if there is evidence of cells that appear cancerous (i.e. have metastasized into the node). The staging of the cancer, and therefore the treatment approach and prognosis, is predicated on the presence of node metastases.

Lymphedema is the condition of swelling (edema) of tissue relating to insufficient clearance by the lymphatic system. It can be congenital as a result usually of undeveloped or absent lymph nodes, and is known as primary lymphedema. Lymphedema most commonly arises in the arms or legs, but can also occur in the chest wall, genitals, neck, and abdomen. Secondary lymphedema usually results from the removal of lymph nodes during breast cancer surgery or from other damaging treatments such as radiation. It can also be caused by some parasitic infections. Affected tissues are at a great risk of infection. Management of lymphedema may include advice to lose weight, exercise, keep the affected limb moist, and compress the affected area. Sometimes surgical management is also considered.

== Similar lymphoid organs ==
The spleen and the tonsils are the larger secondary lymphoid organs that serve somewhat similar functions to lymph nodes, though the spleen filters blood cells rather than lymph. The tonsils are sometimes erroneously referred to as lymph nodes. Although the tonsils and lymph nodes do share certain characteristics, there are also many important differences between them, such as their location, structure and size. Furthermore, the tonsils filter tissue fluid whereas lymph nodes filter lymph.

The appendix contains lymphoid tissue and is therefore believed to play a role not only in the digestive system, but also in the immune system.

<text>A mockumentary (a portmanteau of &quot;mock&quot; and &quot;documentary&quot;) is a type of film or television show depicting fictional events, but presented as a documentary. The term originated in the 1960s but was popularized in the mid-1990s when &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; director Rob Reiner used it in interviews to describe that film.

Mockumentaries are often used to analyze or comment on current events and issues in a satirical way by using a fictional setting, or to parody the documentary form itself. While mockumentaries are usually comedic, pseudo-documentaries are their dramatic equivalents. However, pseudo-documentary should not be confused with docudrama, a fictional genre in which dramatic techniques are combined with documentary elements to depict real events. Nor should either of those be confused with docufiction, a genre in which documentaries are contaminated with fictional elements.

They are often presented as historical documentaries, with B roll and talking heads discussing past events, or as &quot;cinéma vérité&quot; pieces following people as they go through various events. Examples emerged during the 1950s when archival film footage became available. A very early example was a short piece on the &quot;Swiss spaghetti harvest&quot; that appeared as an April Fools&#x27; prank on the British television program &quot;Panorama&quot; in 1957.

Mockumentaries can be partly or wholly improvised.

==Early examples==
Early work, including Luis Buñuel&#x27;s 1933 &quot;Land Without Bread&quot;, Orson Welles&#x27;s 1938 radio broadcast of &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, various April Fools&#x27; Day news reports, and &quot;vérité&quot;-style film and television during the 1960s and 1970s, served as precursor to the genre. Early examples of mock-documentaries include various films by Peter Watkins, such as &quot;The War Game&quot; (1965), &quot;Privilege&quot; (1967), and the dystopic &quot;Punishment Park&quot; (1971).

Further examples are &quot;The Connection&quot; (1961), &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; (1964), &quot;David Holzman&#x27;s Diary&quot; (1967), &quot;Pat Paulsen for President&quot; (1968), &quot;Take the Money and Run&quot; (1969), &quot;The Clowns&quot; (1970) by Federico Fellini (a peculiar hybrid of documentary and fiction, a docufiction), &quot;Smile&quot; (1975), Carlos Mayolo&#x27;s &quot;The Vampires of Poverty&quot; (1977) and &quot;All You Need Is Cash&quot; (1978). Albert Brooks was also an early popularizer of the mockumentary style with his film &quot;Real Life&quot;, 1979, a spoof of the 1973 reality television series &quot;An American Family&quot;. Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Take the Money and Run&quot; is presented in documentary style with Allen playing a fictional criminal, Virgil Starkwell, whose crime exploits are &quot;explored&quot; throughout the film. Jackson Beck, who used to narrate documentaries in the 1940s, provides the voice-over narration. Fictional interviews are inter-spliced throughout, especially those of Starkwell&#x27;s parents who wear Groucho Marx noses and mustaches. The style of this film was widely appropriated by others and revisited by Allen himself in films such as &quot;Men of Crisis: The Harvey Wallinger Story&quot; (1971), &quot;Zelig&quot; (1983) and &quot;Sweet and Lowdown&quot; (1999).

Early use of the mockumentary format in television comedy can be seen in several sketches from &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; (1969–1974), such as &quot;Hell&#x27;s Grannies&quot;, &quot;Piranha Brothers&quot;, and &quot;The Funniest Joke in the World&quot;. &quot;The Hart and Lorne Terrific Hour&quot; (1970–1971) also featured mockumentary pieces that interspersed both scripted and real-life man-in-the-street interviews, the most famous likely being &quot;The Puck Crisis&quot; in which hockey pucks were claimed to have become infected with a form of Dutch elm disease.

&quot;All You Need Is Cash&quot;, developed from an early series of sketches in the comedy series &quot;Rutland Weekend Television&quot;, is a 1978 television film in mockumentary style about &quot;The Rutles&quot;, a fictional band that parodies The Beatles. The Beatles&#x27; own 1964 feature film debut, &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, was itself filmed in mockumentary style; it ostensibly documents a few typical (and highly fictionalized) days in the life of the band as they travel from Liverpool to London for a television appearance.

==Since 1980==
===In film and television===
Since the beginning of the 1980s, the mockumentary format has gained considerable attention. The 1980 South African film &quot;The Gods Must be Crazy&quot; (along with its 1989 sequel) is presented in the manner of a nature documentary, with documentary narrator Paddy O&#x27;Byrne describing the events of the film in the manner of a biologist or anthropologist presenting scientific knowledge to viewers. &quot;The Atomic Cafe&quot; (1983) is a Cold-War era American &quot;mockumentary&quot; film that made use of archival government footage from the 1950s. Woody Allen&#x27;s 1983 film &quot;Zelig&quot; stars Allen as a curiously nondescript enigma who is discovered for his remarkable ability to transform himself to resemble anyone he is near, and Allen is edited into historical archive footage. In 1984, Christopher Guest co-wrote and starred in the mockumentary &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot;, directed by Rob Reiner. Guest went on to write and direct other mockumentaries including &quot;Waiting for Guffman&quot;, &quot;Best in Show&quot;, and &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot;, all written with costar Eugene Levy.

In Central Europe, the first time that viewers were exposed to mockumentary was in 1988 when the Czechoslovakian short film &quot;Oil Gobblers&quot; was shown. For two weeks, TV viewers believed that the oil-eating animals really existed.

Tim Robbins&#x27; 1992 film &quot;Bob Roberts&quot; was a mockumentary centered around the senatorial campaign of a right-wing stock trader and folksinger, and the unsavory connections and dirty tricks used to defeat a long-term liberal incumbent played by Gore Vidal. &quot;Man Bites Dog&quot; is a 1992 Belgian black comedy crime mockumentary written, produced, and directed by Rémy Belvaux, André Bonzel, and Benoît Poelvoorde. In 1995, Peter Jackson and Costa Botes directed &quot;Forgotten Silver&quot;, which claimed New Zealand &quot;director&quot; Colin McKenzie was a pioneer in filmmaking. When the film was later revealed to be a mockumentary, Jackson received criticism for tricking viewers.

&quot;Borat! Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan&quot; from 2006, and its 2020 sequel &quot;Borat Subsequent Moviefilm&quot;, are two controversial yet successful films that use this style, as does &quot;Brüno&quot;, a similar film from 2009 also starring Sacha Baron Cohen. Sony Pictures Animation released their second animated feature, &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; in 2007, which was the first of its kind to incorporate the mockumentary style into animation. &quot;REC&quot;, a 2007 Spanish film by Jaume Balagueró and Paco Plaza, uses journalism aesthetics to approach a horror universe set up in a real building in Barcelona. The film was remade in the United States as the 2008 film &quot;Quarantine&quot;.

Ivo Raza&#x27;s 2020 mockumentary &quot;Reboot Camp&quot; is a comedy about a fake cult that uses an ensemble cast of celebrities from the film (David Koechner, Eric Roberts, Chaz Bono, Ed Begley Jr.), performing arts (Ja Rule, Billy Morrison), and TV (Lindsey Shaw, Pierson Fode, Johnny Bananas) to play fictional versions of themselves.

In television, the most notable mockumentaries in the 2000s have been ABC Australia&#x27;s &quot;The Games&quot; (1998–2000), the Canadian series &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot; (1999–present), the British shows &quot;Marion and Geoff&quot; (2000), &quot;Twenty Twelve&quot; (2011–2012) (which follows the fictional Olympic Deliverance Commission in the run-up to the 2012 Summer Olympics), and &quot;W1A&quot;, which follows the main characters of &quot;Twenty Twelve&quot; as they start work at the BBC, as well as &quot;The Office&quot; (2001) and its many international offshoots, and &quot;Come Fly with Me&quot; (2010), which follows the activity at a fictional airport and its variety of staff and passengers. British comedy duo Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French often presented short mockumentaries as extended sketches in their TV show &quot;French &amp; Saunders&quot;. Discovery Channel opened its annual Shark Week on 4 Aug 2013 with &quot;&quot;, a mockumentary about the survival of the megalodon. The Canadian series &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot; and its films (1998–present) were one of the first mainstream examples of Canadian mockumentaries. Popular examples in the US include sitcoms &quot;The Office&quot; (2005–2013), &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot; (2009–2015), and &quot;Modern Family&quot; (2009–2020); the American improv comedy &quot;Reno 911!&quot; (2003–2009); &quot;Derek&quot; (2012–2014); the comedy series &quot;The Muppets&quot; (2015); &quot;People Just Do Nothing&quot; (2011–2018) and the Australian Chris Lilley shows &quot;Angry Boys&quot;, &quot;Summer Heights High&quot;, &quot;We Can Be Heroes: Finding the Australian of the Year&quot;, &quot;Ja&#x27;mie: Private School Girl&quot;, &quot;Jonah from Tonga&quot; and &quot;Lunatics&quot;. Shows currently running in this format include &quot;What We Do in the Shadows&quot; (2019–2024), &quot;Abbott Elementary&quot; (2021–present), and &quot;St. Denis Medical&quot; (2024–present). Strictly speaking, a mockumentary refers to films, while the term &quot;comedy verite&quot; refers to TV series, though term is widely used here.

The series &quot;Documentary Now!&quot; (2015–present) on IFC, created by &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; alumni Bill Hader, Fred Armisen, and Seth Meyers, spoofs celebrated documentary films by parodying the style and subject of each documentary. Hight argues that television is a natural medium for a mockumentary, as it provides for &quot;extraordinarily rich sources of appropriation and commentary&quot;.

In 2018, the BBC released the series &quot;Cunk on Britain&quot; created by Charlie Brooker and starring Diane Morgan about British history with Philomena Cunk, an extremely dim-witted and ill-informed interviewer, asking various experts ridiculous questions. The follow-up &quot;Cunk on Earth&quot; featuring a similar plot was released by BBC Two in 2022 and is available on Netflix.

===On radio===
The BBC series &quot;People Like Us&quot; was first produced for radio in 1995 before a television version was made in 1999. Kay Stonham&#x27;s &quot;Audio Diaries&quot; was a similarly short tenured radio mockumentary that premiered the year after &quot;People Like Us&quot;&#x27;s run on Radio 4 ended.

<text>Ironbridge is a riverside village in the borough of Telford and Wrekin in Shropshire, England. Located on the bank of the River Severn, at the heart of the Ironbridge Gorge, it lies in the civil parish of The Gorge. Ironbridge developed beside, and takes its name from, the Iron Bridge, a cast iron bridge that was built in 1779.

==History==
The area around Ironbridge is described by those promoting it as a tourist destination as the &quot;birthplace of the Industrial Revolution&quot;. This description is based on the idea that Abraham Darby perfected the technique of smelting iron with coke, in Coalbrookdale, allowing much cheaper production of iron. However, the industrial revolution did not begin in any one place. Darby&#x27;s iron smelting was but one small part of this generalised revolution and was soon superseded by the great iron-smelting areas. However, the bridge – being the first of its kind fabricated from cast iron, and one of the few which have survived to the present day – remains an important symbol representative of the dawn of the industrial age.

The grandson of the first Abraham Darby, Abraham Darby III, built the bridge – originally designed by Thomas Farnolls Pritchard – to link the two areas. Construction began in 1779, and the bridge opened on New Year&#x27;s Day 1781. Soon afterwards the ancient Madeley market was relocated to the new purpose-built square and Georgian Butter Cross. The former dispersed settlement of Madeley Wood gained a planned urban focus as Ironbridge, the commercial and administrative centre of the Coalbrookdale coalfield.

The Iron Bridge proprietors also built the Tontine Hotel to accommodate visitors to the new bridge and the industrial sites of the Severn Gorge. Across a square facing the hotel, stands Ironbridge&#x27;s war memorial, which was erected in 1924. It is a bronze statue of a First World War soldier in marching order, sculpted by Arthur George Walker, whose signature appears as does that of A.B. Burton, the foundry worker who erected it.
On the hillside above the river are situated the stone-built 16th-century hunting lodge at Lincoln Hill, many 17th- and 18th-century workers&#x27; cottages, some imposing Georgian houses built by ironmasters and mine and river barge owners, and many early Victorian villas built from the various coloured bricks and tiles of the locality.

St Luke&#x27;s Church (1837) in simple Commissioners&#x27; Gothic by Samuel Smith of Madeley, has stained glass by David Evans of Shrewsbury. Its design is unusual in that the sanctuary is at the west-end and the tower at the east, in reverse to the majority of churches. This is because the land at the west-end was unstable and unable to take the weight of a tower. The bells in the church tower were installed in 1920 as a memorial to parishioners who died in the First World War, and the external church clock was illuminated in memory of those who died in the Second. The living was endowed as a rectory when the parish was created from Madeley in 1847, and is now a united benefice with Coalbrookdale and Little Wenlock, in the Diocese of Hereford.

The former Ironbridge and Broseley railway station, on the Severn Valley line (GWR) from Hartlebury to Shrewsbury, was situated on the south side of the Iron Bridge until 1966. Ironbridge was the birthplace of England National Football Team captain Billy Wright.

==Present day==

By the 19th century, Ironbridge had had many well-known visitors, including Benjamin Disraeli, but by the mid-20th century, the settlements and industries of the gorge were in decline. In 1986, though, Ironbridge became part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site (which covers the wider Ironbridge Gorge area) and has since become a major tourist attraction within Shropshire. Most industries in Ironbridge are now tourist-related; however, the Merrythought teddy bear company (established in 1930) is still manufacturing in Ironbridge and has a small museum there too. Amongst other things, the centre of Ironbridge is host to a post office, pharmacy, various pubs, cafés and many small independent shops.

Ironbridge was struck by an F1/T2 tornado on 23 November 1981, as part of the record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak on that day. On Thursday 10 July 2003 The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh made a visit to Shropshire which included a visit to Ironbridge, and a walk over the bridge itself.

An annual Coracle Regatta is held in August on the River Severn at Ironbridge, along with many other events throughout the year. This is mainly because the coracle-making family of Rogers lived in Ironbridge for several generations. Just outside Ironbridge in Coalbrookdale is the Ironbridge Institute, a partnership between the University of Birmingham and the Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust offering postgraduate and professional development in heritage.

==Flooding==
Ironbridge has an annually reoccurring problem of flooding from the River Severn, as do many other parts of Shropshire. Flooding has previously caused much damage and disruption to the Wharfage, which accommodates both &quot;The Swan&quot; and &quot;White Hart&quot; pubs, and various private homes. Starting in February 2004, DEFRA, in association with the Environment Agency, implemented a portable barrier which is erected at times of floods. At its peak, the flood water has reached a depth of against the barrier.

On 26 February 2020, after large amounts of rainfall brought by storms Ciara and Dennis, the portable barrier was compromised; it required an evacuation of all residents from the wharfage. Ironbridge flooded again in February 2022.

*George Sedgwick (1846–1934), a British trade union leader, born in Ironbridge.
*Billy Wright CBE (1924–1994), a footballer who played for Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. throughout his career and the first player to earn 100 international caps for England.
*Roger Squires (1932-2023), a British crossword compiler who lived in Ironbridge and holds the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; title as the most prolific crossword compiler.
*Ian Blakemore (born 1965), an English cricketer; left-handed batsman and left-arm slow bowler who played for Herefordshire
*Jay Blades MBE (born 1970), furniture restorer and television presenter, lived here early 2020s.

<doc id="82354" wikidata="Q163354" url="?curid=82354" title="Henry (unit)">
<text>The henry (symbol: H) is the unit of electrical inductance in the International System of Units (SI). If a current of 1 ampere flowing through a coil produces flux linkage of 1 weber turn, that coil has a self-inductance of 1 henry.‌ The unit is named after Joseph Henry (1797–1878), the American scientist who discovered electromagnetic induction independently of and at about the same time as Michael Faraday (1791–1867) in England.

==Definition==
The inductance of an electric circuit is one henry when an electric current that is changing at one ampere per second results in an electromotive force of one volt across the inductor:
:formula_1,
where &quot;V&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is the resulting voltage across the circuit, &quot;I&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is the current through the circuit, and &quot;L&quot; is the inductance of the circuit.

The henry is a derived unit based on four of the seven base units of the International System of Units: kilogram (kg), metre (m), second (s), and ampere (A).
Expressed in combinations of SI units, the henry is:
:formula_2
where: , , , , , , , , , , , , , Hz = hertz, rad = radian

==Use==
The International System of Units (SI) specifies that the symbol of a unit named for a person is written with an initial capital letter, while the name is not capitalized in sentence text, except when any word in that position would be capitalized, such as at the beginning of a sentence or in material using title case.

The United States National Institute of Standards and Technology recommends users writing in English to use the plural as &quot;henries&quot;.

==Applications==
The inductance of a coil depends on its size, the number of turns, and the permeability of the material within and surrounding the coil. Formulae can be used to calculate the inductance of many common arrangements of conductors, such as parallel wires, or a solenoid. A small air-core coil used for broadcast AM radio tuning might have an inductance of a few tens of microhenries. A large motor winding with many turns around an iron core may have an inductance of hundreds of henries. The physical size of an inductance is also related to its current carrying and voltage withstand ratings.

<text>The farad (symbol: F) is the unit of electrical capacitance, the ability of a body to store an electrical charge, in the International System of Units (SI), equivalent to 1 coulomb per volt (C/V). It is named after the English physicist Michael Faraday (1791–1867). In SI base units 1 F = 1 kg−1⋅m−2⋅s4⋅A2.

==Definition==
The capacitance of a capacitor is one farad when one coulomb of charge changes the potential between the plates by one volt. Equally, one farad can be described as the capacitance which stores a one-coulomb charge across a potential difference of one volt.

The relationship between capacitance, charge, and potential difference is linear. For example, if the potential difference across a capacitor is halved, the quantity of charge stored by that capacitor will also be halved.

For most applications, the farad is an impractically large unit of capacitance. Most electrical and electronic applications are covered by the following SI prefixes:

*1 mF (millifarad, one thousandth () of a farad) = 0.001 F =  μF =  pF
*1 μF (microfarad, one millionth () of a farad) = 0.000 001 F =  nF =  pF
*1 nF (nanofarad, one billionth () of a farad) = 0.000 000 001 F = 0.001 μF =  pF
*1 pF (picofarad, one trillionth () of a farad) = 0.000 000 000 001 F = 0.001 nF

===Equalities===
A farad is a derived unit based on four of the seven base units of the International System of Units: kilogram (kg), metre (m), second (s), and ampere (A).

Expressed in combinations of SI units, the farad is:

==History==
The term &quot;farad&quot; was originally coined by Latimer Clark and Charles Bright in 1861, in honor of Michael Faraday, for a unit of quantity of charge, and by 1873, the farad had become a unit of capacitance. In 1881, at the International Congress of Electricians in Paris, the name farad was officially used for the unit of electrical capacitance.

==Explanation==

A capacitor generally consists of two conducting surfaces, frequently referred to as plates, separated by an insulating layer usually referred to as a dielectric. The original capacitor was the Leyden jar developed in the 18th century. It is the accumulation of electric charge on the plates that results in capacitance. Modern capacitors are constructed using a range of manufacturing techniques and materials to provide the extraordinarily wide range of capacitance values used in electronics applications from femtofarads to farads, with maximum-voltage ratings ranging from a few volts to several kilovolts.

Values of capacitors are usually specified in terms of SI prefixes of farads (F), microfarads (μF), nanofarads (nF) and picofarads (pF). The millifarad (mF) is rarely used in practice; a capacitance of 4.7 mF (0.0047 F), for example, is instead written as . The nanofarad (nF) is used more often in Europe than in the United States. The size of commercially available capacitors ranges from around 0.1 pF to (5 kF) supercapacitors. Parasitic capacitance in high-performance integrated circuits can be measured in femtofarads (1 fF = 0.001 pF =  F), while high-performance test equipment can detect changes in capacitance on the order of tens of attofarads (1 aF =  F).

A value of 0.1 pF is about the smallest available in capacitors for general use in electronic design, since smaller ones would be dominated by the parasitic capacitances of other components, wiring or printed circuit boards. Capacitance values of 1 pF or lower can be achieved by twisting two short lengths of insulated wire together.

The capacitance of the Earth&#x27;s ionosphere with respect to the ground is calculated to be about 1 F.

===Informal and deprecated terminology===
The picofarad (pF) is sometimes colloquially pronounced as &quot;puff&quot; or &quot;pic&quot;, as in &quot;a ten-puff capacitor&quot;. Similarly, &quot;mic&quot; (pronounced &quot;mike&quot;) is sometimes used informally to signify microfarads.

Nonstandard abbreviations were and are often used. Farad has been abbreviated &quot;f&quot;, &quot;fd&quot;, and &quot;Fd&quot;. For the prefix &quot;micro-&quot;, when the Greek small letter &quot;μ&quot; or the legacy micro sign &quot;μ&quot; is not available (as on typewriters) or inconvenient to enter, it is often substituted with the similar-appearing &quot;u&quot; or &quot;U&quot;, with little risk of confusion. It was also substituted with the similar-sounding &quot;M&quot; or &quot;m&quot;, which can be confusing because M officially stands for 1,000,000, and m preferably stands for 1/1000. In texts prior to 1960, and on capacitor packages until more recently, &quot;microfarad(s)&quot; was abbreviated &quot;mf&quot; or &quot;MFD&quot; rather than the modern &quot;μF&quot;. A 1940 Radio Shack catalog listed every capacitor&#x27;s rating in &quot;Mfd.&quot;, from 0.000005 Mfd. (5 pF) to 50 Mfd. (50 μF).

&quot;Micromicrofarad&quot; or &quot;micro-microfarad&quot; is an obsolete unit found in some older texts and labels, contains a nonstandard metric double prefix. It is exactly equivalent to a picofarad (pF). It is abbreviated μμF, uuF, or (confusingly) &quot;mmf&quot;, &quot;MMF&quot;, or &quot;MMFD&quot;.

Summary of obsolete or deprecated capacitance units or abbreviations: (upper/lower case variations are not shown)
* μF (microfarad) = mf, mfd, uf
* pF (picofarad) = mmf, mmfd, pfd, μμF

 is a square version of (, the Japanese word for &quot;farad&quot;) intended for Japanese vertical text. 
It is included in Unicode for compatibility with earlier character sets.

===Related concepts===
The reciprocal of capacitance is called electrical elastance, the (non-standard, non-SI) unit of which is the daraf.

==CGS units==
The abfarad (abbreviated abF) is an obsolete CGS unit of capacitance, which corresponds to farads (1 gigafarad, GF).

The statfarad (abbreviated statF) is a rarely used CGS unit equivalent to the capacitance of a capacitor with a charge of 1 statcoulomb across a potential difference of 1 statvolt. It is 1/(10−5 &quot;c&quot;2) farad, approximately 1.1126 picofarads. More commonly, the centimeter (cm) is used, which is equal to the statfarad.

<text>Angers (, , ;) is a city in western France, about southwest of Paris. It is the prefecture of the Maine-et-Loire department and was the capital of the province of Anjou until the French Revolution. The inhabitants of both the city and the province are called &quot;Angevins&quot; or, more rarely, &quot;Angeriens&quot;.

Angers proper covers and has a population of 154,508 inhabitants, while around 432,900 live in its metropolitan area (&quot;aire d&#x27;attraction&quot;). The Angers Loire Métropole is made up of 29 communes covering with 299,500 inhabitants (2018). Not including the broader metropolitan area, Angers is the third most populous commune in northwestern France after Nantes and Rennes and the 18th most populous commune in France.

For centuries, Angers was an important stronghold in northwestern France. It was the cradle of the Plantagenet dynasty and became one of the intellectual centers of Europe during the reign of René of Anjou. Angers developed at the confluence of three rivers, the Mayenne, the Sarthe, and the Loir, all coming from the north and flowing south to the Loire. Their confluence, just north of Angers, creates the Maine, a short but wide river that flows into the Loire several kilometres south.

Today, Angers stands out for its specialization in the plant sector: Végépolys is Europe&#x27;s leading horticultural competitiveness cluster, and the city is also home to the headquarters of the Community Plant Variety Office. In addition, the Angers metropolitan area is a major economic centre in western France, particularly active in industry and tourism. Angers enjoys a rich cultural life, made possible by its universities and museums. The old medieval center is still dominated by the massive château of the Plantagenêts, home of the &quot;Apocalypse Tapestry&quot;, the biggest medieval tapestry ensemble in the world. Angers is also both at the edge of the Val de Loire, a World Heritage Site, and the Loire-Anjou-Touraine regional natural park.

== Toponymy ==

=== Etymology ===

The city is first mentioned by Ptolemy around AD 150 in his &quot;Geography&quot;. It was then known as Juliomagus (, &quot;Iouliómagos&quot;), a name by which it also appears in the . The name is a compound of the Latin name Julius (probably in reference to Julius Caesar) and the Celtic &quot;magos&quot;, &quot;market&quot;. Similar town dedications were common in Roman Gaul, and toponyms often kept a Gallic element.

When the location needed to be distinguished from other Juliomagi, it was known as Juliomagus Andecavorum (&quot;Juliomagus of the Andecavi&quot;), in reference to the principal Gallic tribe in and around the city.

Around AD 400, the city came to be referred to as the civitas Andecavorum (&quot;tribal capital of the Andecavi&quot;). This was a common change in Gaul, also seen in the names of Paris, Tours and Évreux around this time. During the Middle Ages, the late Latin name gradually developed into the modern one. It is successively mentioned as Andecava civitas (6th century), Andecavis (AD 769), Andegavis (861  882), Angieus (in 1127) and Angeus (in 1205). The form Angiers appeared during the 12th century and was later corrupted to &quot;Angers&quot;.

The Latin &quot;Andecavum&quot; also gave Anjou its name. This double formation is quite common in France and is also seen in Poitiers and Poitou, and Bourges and Berry.

=== Nicknames ===

Angers was traditionally known as the &quot;Black City&quot; () because many roofs were built of slate, due to the quarry in neighbouring Trélazé. These have become less common since the development of the city in the 19th century.
The city has also been known as:

* &quot;The Athens of the West&quot; (), a name borne since the 19th century from the development of its university
* &quot;The City of Flowers&quot; (), a name from the Second Empire
* &quot;Green City&quot; (), in reference to its numerous parks and important horticultural industry
* &quot;Angers the White&quot; (), from its modern tufa façades and with ironic reference to its former name

=== Heraldry ===

The coat of arms of Angers bears the French royal fleur de lys of the dukes of Anjou (the first duke was the son of the king of France, Jean II); the key evokes the stronghold position of the city close to the Breton border. An acrostic from the Middle Ages calls it &quot;Antique clef de France&quot;, which means &quot;Ancient key to France&quot;:

* Antique clef de France, (&quot;antique key to France&quot;)
* Neteté de souffrance, (&quot;sharpness of displeasure&quot;)
* Garant contre ennemis, (&quot;protection against enemies&quot;)
* Etappe d&#x27;assurance, (&quot;step of assurance&quot;)
* Recours de secourance, (&quot;help of relief&quot;)
* Securité d&#x27;amis. (&quot;security for friends&quot;)

Under Napoleon I&#x27;s rule, Angers was one of the &quot;Bonnes villes&quot; and was therefore allowed to ask for a new coat of arms. The bees, symbol of the First French Empire, then replaced the royal fleurs de lys.

In 1949, Angers received the 1939–1945 War Cross and since then, the decoration is sometimes placed between the two fleurs de lys.

Angers also had several mottos through its history:

* During Antiquity: &quot;Assiuis conciliis&quot; (or &quot;consiliis&quot;);
* From 1434 to 1480 (reign of René of Anjou): &quot;D&#x27;ardent désir&quot;;
* In 1499: &quot;Antique clef de France&quot;;
* Until June 1987: &quot;Angers, la qualité&quot;.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
Angers is located at the geographical center of the Maine-et-Loire department, on the road (A11 autoroute, &quot;L&#x27;Océane&quot;) which connects Paris to the Atlantic Ocean. The city is situated just south of the confluence of the Loir, Mayenne and Sarthe, which form together the river Maine. The Maine crosses Angers and heads south towards the Loire. The confluence of the three rivers and the proximity of the Loire make up a natural crossroads which favoured the foundation of the antique &quot;Juliomagus&quot;.

Angers is located from Nantes, from Rennes, from Poitiers and from Paris. It is also far from Pornic, the closest sea resort, situated on the Atlantic Ocean.

Elevation varies above sea level.

Angers is a hilly town, particularly marked by a rocky promontory dominating the lower valley of Anjou. This was the site of the ancient city and still houses the town&#x27;s castle, cathedral, and medieval quarters.

At the north and south, where the river Maine arrives in and leaves Angers, the landscape is formed by islands, ponds and floodplains which are a haven for birds and a typical flora of the Val de Loire. The étang Saint-Nicolas and Lac de Maine, both artificial, are among the biggest green areas of the city.

=== Metropolitan area ===

The commune of Angers is bordered by ten other communes which form various suburbs. These are, clockwise, Avrillé, Cantenay-Épinard, Écouflant, Saint-Barthélemy-d&#x27;Anjou, Trélazé, Les Ponts-de-Cé, Sainte-Gemmes-sur-Loire, Bouchemaine and Beaucouzé. 22 other communes situated farther form with them the Communauté urbaine Angers Loire Métropole. All these peripheral communes are situated within from Angers proper. Together, they have around 272,400 inhabitants.

=== Climate ===

Angers has an oceanic climate, with moderate rain year-round. Winters have scarce frosts and snowfalls, and summers are warm and sunny.

=== Urban morphology ===
The oldest streets and buildings in Angers are located on the promontory where the Angers castle stands. The urban structure there dates back from the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries.

A military presence there was attested from the 3rd century and some remains of an antique city wall are still visible on the castle grounds. This wall was built to protect the city from the Germanic invasions of AD 275 and 276.

During the Middle Ages, the castle was the core of the city&#x27;s defence system, composed of tall city walls and river chains which prevented enemy ships from going up the Maine. The walls were last reconstructed between 1230 and 1240, by order of King Louis IX. Today, portions of the wall are still visible in Rue Toussaint and on Boulevard Carnot, as are some towers, like the &quot;Tour Villebon&quot; and the &quot;Tour des Anglais&quot;.

Before the first cadastre (1810), the city had not extended much beyond its medieval limits: on and around the castle promontory, with some dwellings on the other bank of the Maine in a neighbourhood called &quot;La Doutre&quot;. That part of the city developed quickly during the industrial revolution and became a big river port. Industry was encouraged by firms like Bessonneau (textile factories) and Cointreau (distillery).

After 1850, many suburbs appeared around the train stations and the slate quarries to the south in Trélazé. Despite the port in La Doutre, demographic growth and urban extension were more significant on the eastern bank of the Maine, where the former Juliomagus had been founded.

The medieval city center was redeveloped and expanded from 1791. The &quot;Place du Ralliement&quot;, the main square, was then built in place of three churches destroyed during the French Revolution and, later, ring boulevards planted with trees replaced the city walls.

The architectural style used is mainly Haussmanian, but there are also some Palladian, Art Nouveau or Art Deco buildings.

After 1945 and the Second World War, several large council estates made of tower blocks were built around the city center, the first of them being Belle-Beille in 1953. Industrial activity changed drastically: port activity declined while new factories, such as Technicolor SA in 1957, were built. During the 1970s, the collective approach to urban development gave way to more individual houses being built for the middle class.

As the metropolitan area continued to grow, commuting became more common. New shopping areas were constructed close to the villages which had been subsumed into the city. Because of the floodplains that surround the city north and south, Angers can only grow significantly on an east–west axis.

=== Green areas ===
Being both at the edge of the Val de Loire World Heritage site and on the largest river confluence in France, Angers has a high natural potential, notably highlighted by the Saint-Aubin island, situated north of the center and covering a tenth of the city total surface. Protected, the island is formed of swamps and natural meadows.

The oldest green areas date back from the Renaissance, when the moats of the castle were transformed into pleasure and kitchen gardens. Similar gardens were built by the aristocracy around their hôtels particuliers and physic garden were planted in hospices cloisters. The Jardin des plantes, the first botanical garden, dates back from the beginning of the 18th century. During the 19th century, others were built, for example the Faculty of Pharmacy garden and the Roseraie. The first recreational parks, for their part, were built during the Second French Empire. The étang Saint-Nicolas, made by a sluice on a small river, the Brionneau, was protected as early as 1936.

The Jardin du Mail (&quot;Mall Garden&quot;), an esplanade situated outside the ring boulevards, was built between 1820 and 1880 on the former Champs de Mars (Fields of Mars, a place where the garrisons used to train and parade). Another esplanade, the Mail François Mitterrand, was built in 1999 together with a garden inside the new Saint-Serge business district. During the 1960s the old gravel pits around the Maine were filled with water to form the Lac de Maine, which now hosts a marina. In 2010, a large amusement park, Terra Botanica, was inaugurated close to Saint-Aubin island.

== History ==
=== Prehistory and antiquity ===
The first sign of human presence in Angers dates back to around 400,000 BC. Vestiges from the Neolithic are more abundant and include numerous polished stone axes. Burials from 4500  3500 BC were also discovered on the castle grounds.

During the 5th century BC, the Andecavi, a Celtic people, settled north of the Loire. By the end of the Iron Age, Angers was a relatively densely populated hillfort. While the settlement&#x27;s Roman name—Juliomagus—may be older, it is only attested from the 3rd century. The Roman town consisted of many villas and baths and had an amphitheater as well as a Mithraeum, a temple dedicated to Mithra.

Successive Germanic invasions in AD 275 and 276 forced the inhabitants to move to the highest point of their city and to build a wall around a small area of around .

=== Middle Ages ===
Angers received its first bishop in 372 during the election of Martin of Tours. The first abbey, Saint-Aubin, was built during the 7th century to house the sarcophagus of Saint Albinius. Saint-Serge Abbey was founded by the Merovingian kings Clovis II and Theuderic III a century later. In 2008, ten Frankish sarcophagi from that period were discovered where Saint-Morille church once stood during the tramway construction.

From the 850s, Angers suffered from its situation on the border with Brittany and Normandy. In September 851, Charles the Bald and Erispoe, a Breton chief, met in the town to sign the Treaty of Angers, which secured Breton independence and fixed the borders of Brittany. However, the situation remained dangerous for Angers, and Charles the Bald created in 853 a wide buffer zone around Brittany comprising parts of Anjou, Touraine, Maine and Sées, which was ruled by Robert the Strong, a great-grandfather of Hugh Capet.

In 870, the Viking chief Hastein seized Angers where he settled until a successful siege temporarily displaced him. He again took control of the town in 873, before the Carolingian Emperor ousted him.
Fulk I of Anjou, a Carolingian descendant, was the first viscount of Angers (before 898 until 929) and of Tours (898–909), and count of Nantes (909–919). Around 929, he took the title of count (earl) of Angers and founded the first Anjou dynasty, the House of Ingelger (&quot;French: Ingelgeriens&quot;). Angers subsequently formed the capital of the province of Anjou.

During the 12th century, after internal divisions in Brittany, the county of Nantes was annexed by Anjou. Henry II Plantagenêt kept it for more than 30 years. The grandson of Henry I of England, he also succeeded to the English crown and ruled the vast Angevin Empire, which stretched from the Pyrenees to Ireland. The castle of Angers was then the seat of the Court and the dynasty. The Empire disappeared in 1204–1205 when the King of France, Philip II, seized Normandy and Anjou. Henceforth, there were no more counts of Anjou, as the French king had made Anjou a dukedom.

Now a part of the Kingdom of France, Angers became the &quot;Key to the Kingdom&quot; () facing still independent Brittany. In 1228, during Louis IX&#x27;s minority, Blanche of Castile decided to fortify the city and to rebuild the castle. Later, during the 1350s and 1360s, the schools of Law, Medicine and Theology, renowned in Europe, were organized into a university. In 1373, Louis I of Naples and Anjou ordered the six tapestries illustrating the Apocalypse of St John known today as the &quot;Apocalypse Tapestry&quot;.

=== Renaissance ===
King René of Anjou contributed to the economic revival in a city that had been diminished by the Black Death (1347–1350) and the Hundred Years War (1337–1453). A man of great culture and generosity, René transformed Angers into a cultural and political center and held court there. He transformed the castle moat into a menagerie and built several gardens. He also founded in Angers a new Ordre du Croissant which was supposed to compete with the Order of the Golden Fleece, created several years earlier.

In 1474, Louis XI of France, in his attempt to conquer Anjou, came to Angers with his army, asking for the keys of the city. René, then 65 years old, did not want to lead a war against his nephew and surrendered his domains without a fight. Thus, Anjou ceased to be an appanage and fell into the Royal domain. After his death, René was buried in 1480 in Saint-Maurice cathedral.
In 1551, Angers became the seat of a bailiwick and the presidial court of a jurisdiction, a position the city kept until 1790. At the same time, with the growth of Protestantism in France, a Catholic was placed at the head of the city and its castle while the bourgeoisie formed a Catholic militia to protect Angers from the Huguenots. The bishop, Gabriel Bouvery, organized on his side an &quot;Angevin League&quot;.

When the news of the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre reached Angers, another massacre took place in the city. The bodies of slain Protestants were thrown into the Mayenne. It was the aldermen who stopped the slaughter.

In 1598, the Edict of Nantes was prepared by Henri IV in Angers. From 6 March until 2 April, Angers was the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of France and the King tried all means to satisfy the Catholics of the city, for example by laying the cornerstone of the new Capucine convent.

=== Classical period ===
In 1619, Louis XIII of France gave the governance of Anjou to his mother, Marie de&#x27; Medici. The Queen Mother settled in Angers, at the Logis Barrault, with her chaplain, Cardinal Richelieu.

At the premature death of Louis XIII in 1643, his son Louis XIV was only an infant. France was troubled at this time by several famines and epidemics, and by political instability. In 1649, the people of Angers revolted against rising taxes, the start of the Fronde in Anjou. The Fronde was a nationwide military conflict opposing some aristocrats wanting more autonomy and the Royal forces loyal to Anne of Austria as Queen Mother and Regent, and her prime minister, Cardinal Mazarin. Royalist repression in Angers was narrowly averted by Bishop Henri Arnauld, who interceded with the Queen Mother. Arnauld, who would remain Bishop of Angers until 1692, was to leave a deep mark on the religious life of the city during the second half of the 17th century.

In 1652, Henri Chabot, Duke of Rohan and governor of Anjou, decided to back Louis of Condé, leader of the Fronde. Angers again became rebellious and Louis XIV sent his army to seize it. The Duke of Rohan immediately surrendered and thus again prevented the sack of the city.

=== French Revolution ===
The first months of the French Revolution were relatively quiet in Angers. In 1789, the city lost its ancient administrative positions, replaced in 1790 by the department of &quot;Mayenne-et-Loire&quot;, soon renamed &quot;Maine-et-Loire&quot;. Anjou, as a political entity, disappeared, although the new department included most of its territory.

The War of Vendée, a Royalist rebellion and counterrevolution led in Vendée, a department located at the southwest of Maine-et-Loire, reached the Loire in March 1793. The Royalist army soon crossed the river and progressed as far as Granville, in Normandy, in November. Pushed back, the Vendéens went back south and, to cross the Loire again, had to attack Angers.

The city was defended by 4,000 Republican soldiers, whereas the Royalists were at least 20,000, but weakened by successive fights and deceases. The Siege of Angers occurred on 3 and 4 December 1793. The Royalists&#x27; bad tactics, as well as the strength of Angers city wall and castle, caused their loss. They consequently went back north for a while, around Le Mans, before crossing the Loire at Ancenis on 16 December.

In 1794, fierce repression was conducted in the whole region against the Royalists. In Angers, 290 prisoners were shot and 1020 died of illness in jail. The city also welcomed many refugees, mostly Republicans living in Royalist rural areas. Between 19 and 31 May 1793, between 650 and 1000 Republican families sought asylum in Angers.

=== Since 1800 ===

During the 19th century, the city was deeply influenced by the urban transformations in Paris. The city traditionally had a somewhat sombre appearance from the quantity of local slate used in construction but many quarters were gradually destroyed, redeveloped, or rebuilt on the Parisian model. The city wall, which formed a square around the old city core, was demolished around 1850 and replaced by wide boulevards. New districts of the city were also opened up on the opposite bank of the river.

The Hôtel de Ville (City Hall) was officially opened as a municipal building on 23 September 1823.

In 1849, the Angers-Saumur railway was built; it was extended to Nantes two years later. When completed, the line connected Paris to the Atlantic coast.

In 1850, a catastrophic failure of the Angers Bridge suspension bridge caused the deaths of over 200 soldiers. The disaster inhibited the construction of suspension bridges in France for two decades. The accident was mainly caused by soldiers&#x27; lilting march which created resonance in the bridge structure.

In 1875, a &quot;free faculty&quot; was created. It was soon assimilated to the medieval Angevin University (), which had been dissolved during the French Revolution. The new faculty was canonically erected as the Catholic University of Angers () by Pope Pius IX in 1879. However, in 1890, a law prohibited private institutions of higher education from calling themselves &quot;universities&quot;. The institution was then renamed the &quot;Free Faculty of Angers&quot; (), although it kept its original name on an informal basis. At the beginning of the 20th century, two higher education establishments, specializing in agriculture and commercial sciences, were opened.
During the first half of the 20th century, several Art Nouveau and Art Deco buildings were constructed, such as the &quot;Nouvelles Galeries&quot;, the &quot;Hotel des Postes&quot;, &quot;Hotel Continental&quot;, the &quot;Alcazar&quot; and the &quot;Maison bleue&quot;.

In September 1939, when Poland was invaded by Germany, the Polish government-in-exile settled in Angers. It left the city on 12 June 1940, after the invasion of France by the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;. Angers fell to the Nazis during the same month. The Germans made it the seat of a regional Kommandantur. In 1941, a first Resistance movement, called &quot;Honneur et Patrie&quot;, was created in Angers. 60 Resistants were shot at the Belle-Beille range in 1942 and a German bunker factory employed 6000 people in 1943. In July 1942, 853 Jews were arrested and sent to Auschwitz.

On the night of 28 May 1944, the first Allied bombing occurred over the Saint-Laud quarter. 243 people died and many others were wounded. Successive attacks on 29 and 30 May destroyed the train station and its surroundings which were reconstructed in the 1950s.

After liberating Avranches and Rennes, General Patton and his 5th infantry division arrived in Anjou on 5 August. To seize Angers, they decided to enter the city by its eastern side to surprise the Nazis. On 9 August, they crossed the Maine and started the fight. Helped by the local French Forces of the Interior, they progressively moved forward to the city center. The fight was nevertheless difficult and Angers was liberated the day after, at around 5 p.m.

After the end of the war, the city experienced quick development and demographic growth. In 1971, a decision was made to reestablish a public university, and the Université catholique d&#x27;Angers was split between the Université catholique de l&#x27;Ouest (private) and the Université d&#x27;Angers (public). Angers continues to have two different universities.

Until the 1980s, Angers experienced several massive urban development plans, such as the construction of the Lac de Maine, and several vast council estates and shopping malls, as well as the construction of a highway which crossed the city through its center, a project that forced the destruction of many old buildings and destroyed the original quays on the Maine. Later, other urban plans were drawn up, with a new emphasis on nature and heritage protection, as well as on social mixing. During the 1990s, the redevelopment of the Saint-Serge quarter, located just north of the historical center, produced a new business center, gardens and university buildings.
== Administration ==
Angers received its communal charter from Louis XI of France in February 1475, but free elections for the mayor and aldermen were not guaranteed before 1484, following a decision by Charles VIII. Since then, 75 successive mayors have governed Angers.

Until the Second World War, Angers was mainly governed by centrist and republican mayors. From 1977 until 2014, all the successive mayors were members of the Socialist Party, whereas the Maine-et-Loire department has always been governed by moderate right-wing parties. The current mayor (as at May 2023) is Jean-Marc Verchère.

Angers is divided into eight cantons; most of them include parts of Angers plus some surrounding communes. These cantons are not administrative entities and only serve to elect the members of the department council. The INSEE, the French institute for statistics, divides the commune of Angers into twelve sectors. Depending on their social and economic issues, some of them can have priority for financial assistance and urban regeneration. In Angers, five are considered as priority sectors, three as sensitive urban areas, and one as an urban free zone.

Being the chef-lieu of Maine-et-Loire, Angers is the seat of a prefecture. It is also the seat of a Court of Appeal and of several regional or local institutes, concerning for example, customs, education or science. Angers also has several other courts of justice as well as a prison.

== Demographics ==

In 2017, Angers had 152,960 inhabitants, 1.2% more than ten years before. It is the 18th most populated commune in France. In 2018, the urban area (&quot;unité urbaine&quot;), which encompasses Angers plus eleven surrounding communes ( in total), had 242,613 inhabitants. The metropolitan area (&quot;aire d&#x27;attraction&quot;) included in 2018 81 communes, 432,939 inhabitants and . The Angers Loire Métropole, an economic and political association of communes, includes 29 communes and around 313,000 inhabitants.

The population of Angers is relatively young, with 46% of the population being younger than 30 and 22% of residents over 60 years old. This is partially explained by the presence of two universities, 21.0% of the population between 15 and 64 being pupils and students in 2017.

== Economy ==
The early prosperity of the town was largely due to the nearby quarries of slate, whose abundant use for the roofs of Angers led to its sobriquet as the &quot;Black City&quot;. In the mid-19th century, the principal manufactures were goods for sailing ships (sailcloth and rope), linen and hose, sugar, leather, wax, and oil, as well as agricultural products (mainly wheat, wine, and fruit). By the time of the First World War, Cointreau had developed the distillation of liqueurs from the area&#x27;s fruit to an industrial level. The work for sailing ships was still carried on but steamships had greatly reduced demand. Instead, local companies produced cables, wires, and thread and increased production of footwear, umbrellas, and parasols. The area&#x27;s vineyards focused on sparkling wine and fruit was increasingly preserved for sale elsewhere. The area had also developed a small-scale textile industry and begun producing machines, as well as commercial-scale production of hemp and flowers.

Present-day Angers provides 45.7% of the Maine-et-Loire job positions. It is the 22nd-largest national job provider and the 3rd-largest one in northwestern France after Nantes and Rennes. Its unemployment rate (13.5% in 2017) is above the national rate. 20.7% of the people working in Angers have graduate or post-graduate qualifications.

Cointreau continues to produce its orange triple-sec liqueur in nearby Saint-Barthélemy-d&#x27;Anjou, but many of the other industries have since vanished. Modern Angers produces Scania trucks at Écouflant and computers by Bull, Packard Bell, and NEC. It also supports research labs investigating horticulture and biotechnology. Thanks to its several higher education schools, laboratories, and various offices, Angers is the largest horticultural center in Europe and, as the home of the Community Plant Variety Office, Angers is the hub of the plant breeders&#x27; rights system in the European Community. For example, Angers is the leading hydrangeas producer in Europe. The local economy also relies on the presence of many administrative, educational, and health institutions. There are also many small firms, chiefly focused on the agricultural tradition of Maine-et-Loire. Angers also serves as a regional financial center, with many banks and insurance companies (including Afone, CNP Assurances, Crédit Agricole, Fiducial, and Groupama) maintaining their regional offices there.

Angers is an important convention center, with a present convention trade of around €8,000,000. The new convention center slated for 2016 has been cancelled in 2013. The renovation of the previous convention center and the addition of a 400 conference room at the back by the garden should be finished in 2018. The &quot;Parc des Expositions&quot;, where fairs are currently held, welcomes 600,000 visitors and more than 300 events each year. With its , it is the biggest structure of its type in northwestern France.

== Health and education ==
The &quot;Hôtel-Dieu&quot;, founded in the 12th century, is one of the oldest hospitals in France. First located in the &quot;Hospice Saint-Jean&quot;, it moved into new buildings in 1870; it became Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) in 1966. It has 1,500 beds and around 5,500 people work there. Two private hospitals and a regional center for re-education also exist.

A center of learning, Angers boasts two renowned universities and several specialized institutions, altogether enrolling more than 26,000 students. The Catholic University of the West ( or UCO) is one of five Catholic universities in France. UCO is best known for its International Center for the Study of the French Language ( or CIDEF), which provides college students from around the world with college-level course instruction in the French language, and for its Institute for the Development of Consulting and Business ( or IDCE), an important business school which offers undergraduate and graduate (MBA) degrees in International Business and Consulting. The town is also home to a state university, the University of Angers, best university in France in 2015 for success rates.
Angers is also home to engineering graduate schools, such as the Arts et Métiers ParisTech, top school in mechanical and industrial engineering and the ESEO, an engineering school in electronics and computer science and ESAIP, an engineering school in risk management and environment. Its education and research institutes are the driving force behind the city&#x27;s science and technology industries. Angers&#x27;s other educational institutions include &quot;lycées&quot;, training colleges, and a school of fine art.

Another Angers&#x27;s Business School is ESSCA (). Formerly part of the UCO, the school&#x27;s Master&#x27;s program is of a duration of five years. ESSCA recruits students after the Baccalaureat.

In addition to French schools and universities, an American university, St. Edward&#x27;s University, has a new expanding campus in Angers. St. Edward&#x27;s University is a diverse, Catholic liberal arts institution from Austin, Texas. The university has a partnership with UCO, and offers a variety of courses of undergraduate level and professional training.

== Transport ==

Angers is situated on the crossroads of three highways, the A11, to Paris and Nantes, the A87 to La Roche-sur-Yon and the A85 to Tours and Lyon. National roads connect the city with Rennes, Caen and Laval.

Before the construction of bypasses during the 2000s, the A11 crossed the city center, following the river Maine, and passed just below the castle. Causing air pollution and noise and disfiguring the Maine quays, the portions of the former highway which are still in place should be redeveloped in the coming years.

Angers inaugurated the new Irigo tram system on 25 June 2011. The tramway consists of one line with 25 stops. The line runs from Avrillé-Ardenne in the north to Angers-Roseraie in the south, passing by the center and the train station. Service is provided by Keolis using 17 Alstom Citadis trams. The system uses partial ground-level power supply, which avoids aerial wires and preserves the historical character of the city center. A second line is scheduled for 2018–2022. Besides the tram, Irigo also organizes the bus network in Angers consisting of 13 urban lines and 12 suburban lines.

The bus station, situated outside the Angers Saint-Laud train station, is a hub for the departmental bus network (&quot;Anjoubus&quot;) and is also served by international bus companies.

Angers is on both the Nantes-Paris and Nantes-Lyon railways. The city has several train stations, all originally built in the 19th century. Some are still in use; others are closed or reserved for freight. The main station, Angers Saint-Laud, is on a TGV line and has direct TGV services to Paris (1 hour 30 minutes), Lyon (3 hours 45 minutes), Strasbourg (4 hours 35 minutes), and Lille (3 hours 25 minutes), as well as Avignon, Marseille and Montpellier. Regional trains go to Cholet, Saumur, Tours, Blois, Nevers and Bourges.

The nearest airport is Angers - Loire Airport, which replaced in 1998 an older airport near the Saint-Aubin island. The airport is located in the commune of Marcé, from Angers and close to the A11 and the A85. It can receive 50,000 passengers per year.

== Culture ==

=== Main sights ===
The Château d&#x27;Angers, built on a schist promontory, dominates the river Maine and the old town. Its site has been occupied since antiquity; the castle itself was built between 1230 and 1240 by Louis IX of France. The massive walls are about one kilometer long and punctuated by 17 towers; they were built with horizontal slices of tuff and schist, giving it strength and an original striped look. During the 15th century, a chapel and the Châtelet were added in the courtyard.

The &quot;&quot; (&quot;Adam&#x27;s House&quot;), located behind the cathedral, is an excellent example of the half-timbered houses which were built during the Middle Ages. Many similar houses, although smaller, are also visible along the streets around the castle. The city also displays several Renaissance and classical hôtels particuliers, the most renowned being the &quot;Logis Pincé&quot; from the 16th century. The &quot;Maison bleue&quot; (&quot;Blue House&quot;), built in 1927, is an Art Deco masterpiece. The former seat of the French Aviation Company () was built in 1938 and abandoned during the Second World War. Totally refurbished in 2004, it is now a testimony to 1930s architecture.

The Angers Cathedral is a major landmark in the cityscape, with its two spires culminating at . The construction of the current building started during the 12th century on the remains of an older sanctuary. The original structure, romanesque, received gothic columns and vaults in the middle of the 12th century, giving birth to the Angevin gothic, a style that quickly spread in Western France and the Angevin possessions in Italy. Sculptures and architectural details were added to the façade during the 16th century. The twin spires were built in 1518 and 1523. The neighbouring &quot;Palais du Tau&quot;, the former episcopal palace, dates from the 12th century.

The skyline is also marked by the &quot;Tour Saint-Aubin&quot;. Completed in 1170, it was the bell-tower of an abbey closed during the French Revolution and destroyed in 1810. Elaborately sculptured 11th and 12th century arcades also survive in the courtyard of the Prefecture. Another abbey, the &quot;Abbaye Toussaint&quot;, founded during the 13th century, was also partially pulled down and only the church and parts of the cloister are still visible. On the southern limits of the commune, close to the Maine, stands the &quot;Couvent de la Baumette&quot;, founded during the 15th century by René of Anjou.

La Doutre, an old quarter located on the western bank of the Maine and facing the castle, contains two major medieval sites, the former &quot;Abbaye du Ronceray&quot;, built during the 11th and 12th century, and the &quot;Hôpital Saint-Jean&quot;, founded by Henry II of England and used as the city hospital until 1870.

=== Museums ===
The Musée des Beaux-Arts d&#x27;Angers, located in the Renaissance &quot;Logis Barrault&quot;, displays a collection of paintings and sculptures dating from the 14th century to today. It is particularly renowned for its 18th-century paintings, including works by Jean-Baptiste Greuze, Van Loo, Antoine Watteau, Jean-Honoré Fragonard, and Jean Siméon Chardin. The museum also contains a graphic design studio, a gallery devoted to the history of Angers and a temporary exhibition gallery. The institution has an annexe at the château in Villevêque, a village located several kilometers north of the city.

Inside the castle, a special gallery displays the &quot;Apocalypse Tapestry&quot;, ordered by Louis I of Naples at the end of the 14th century. It is more than long, the largest medieval tapestry in the world. Inspired by manuscript miniatures, the successive scenes, designed by Jean Bondol, illustrate the Apocalypse of St John.

Located inside the old &quot;Hôpital Saint-Jean&quot;, the &quot;Musée Jean-Lurçat et de la tapisserie contemporaine&quot; displays tapestries dating from the 19th and 20th centuries. The museum is dedicated to Jean Lurçat, an artist noted for his role in the revival of contemporary tapestry, and notably exhibits his &quot;Chant du Monde&quot;, a modern echo to the &quot;Apocalypse Tapestry&quot; made after the bombing of Hiroshima.

The Muséum d&#x27;histoire naturelle d&#x27;Angers has been located in the 1521 Hôtel Demarie-Valentin since 1885. It exhibits a large collection of mounted animals and fossils, divided in three departments, one for zoology, one for botany and the last one for paleontology and geology.

The &quot;Logis Pincé&quot;, constructed during the Renaissance, is the home of the museum of the same name. It displays Egyptian, Greek, Roman, and Etruscan antiquities as well as Chinese and Japanese artifacts.

Located in the &quot;Abbaye Toussaint&quot;, the &quot;Galerie David d&#x27;Angers&quot; gathers sculptures, reliefs, and medallions by David d&#x27;Angers, a 19th-century sculptor born in the city. The gallery also owns the preparatory works for the Panthéon of Paris pediment.

Angers also enjoys a &quot;Maison de l&#x27;Architecture&quot;, which organizes various exhibitions and workshops, as well as several temporary exhibition galleries distributed in the city center. Outside the commune limits are also an aviation museum and a museum of communications.

=== Entertainment and performing arts ===
The Grand Théâtre, dominating the Place du Ralliement, was first built in 1791, but destroyed by a fire in 1853. The existing building was completed in 1871 and its auditorium contains six stalls and four balconies, totalling 730 seats. The Théâtre du Quai, inaugurated in 2007, has two auditoriums: one contains 980 seats and several balconies, and the other, more flexible, can welcome 400 seated or 960 standing spectators. The Grand Théâtre and the Théâtre du Quai are the venues of three institutions, Angers-Nantes Opéra, an opera company also based in Nantes, the Contemporary Dance National Center (CNDC), inaugurated by Alwin Nikolais in 1978, and the Nouveau théâtre d&#x27;Angers (NTA).

The Orchestre National des Pays de la Loire, shared with Nantes, usually performs at the Congress Center, built in 1983, with a capacity of 1,240 seats. Other concert halls include the &quot;Chabada&quot;, the &quot;Amphitéa&quot; and the former Ursuline chapel. Local theater companies perform at Théâtre Chanzy, Théâtre du Champ de Bataille, Théâtre de la Comédie or at the Centre Jean Vilar. Each September, the city organizes a street performance festival, called the &quot;Accroche-Cœurs&quot;.

The &quot;Chabada&quot;, a popular concert hall, is the cradle of the Angevin contemporary scene and several groups and performers were discovered there, Les Thugs, a punk band formed in 1983, being the first ones. The local scene also includes the alternative rock group La Ruda, the power pop band Pony Pony Run Run, the world music band Lo&#x27;Jo and Titi Robin, a performer influenced by Gypsy and Arabic music.

The Premiers Plans festival, dedicated to European first films and meant to help new directors meet their audience, is conducted every year and lasts one week. The films are screened in three small cinemas, while two big generalist multiplexes also exist in Angers.

=== Media ===

Angers had a local TV channel &quot;Angers 7&quot; which went bankrupt in 2010 and was replaced 3 years later by &quot;Angers Télé&quot;. The national French channel France 3, however, still presents local news in its programs. Several national radio stations, such as Virgin Radio, NRJ and Chérie FM maintain local antennas in Angers. The city is also the home of two local stations, &quot;Radio Campus&quot; and &quot;Radio G!&quot;. &quot;Ouest-France&quot; and &quot;Le Courrier de l&#x27;Ouest&quot; are the two local newspapers, the last one having its headquarters in Angers. The city and Angers Loire Métropole also edit their news bulletins.

== Sport ==
Angers has many sport teams playing at top levels. Angers SCO is Angers&#x27;s football team. The club was created in 1919 and returned to Ligue 1 (French top league) in 2015 after 21 years. Les Ducs d&#x27;Angers is Angers&#x27;s ice hockey team. The club plays in the Magnus League (first division). Anjou BC is Angers&#x27;s basketball team, playing in second division. Vaillante Angers is Angers&#x27;s table tennis team playing in top division Pro A since the 2000–2001 season. Angers also acts as home to the Angers Aviron Nautique, a rowing club which actively competes in regattas across France.

Raymond Kopa Stadium is the main sports venue which can hold 18,000 people. The city also has a variety of sports halls, tennis courts, swimming pools, shooting and archery stands, a velodrome, a rowing center, an ice rink and a fencing hall. The Lac de Maine Stadium hosted the athletics championships in France in July 2009.

<text>In regression analysis, least squares is a parameter estimation method based on minimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals (a residual being the difference between an observed value and the fitted value provided by a model) made in the results of each individual equation. (More simply, least squares is a mathematical procedure for finding the best-fitting curve to a given set of points by minimizing the sum of the squares of the offsets (&quot;the residuals&quot;) of the points from the curve.)

The most important application is in data fitting. When the problem has substantial uncertainties in the independent variable (the &quot;x&quot; variable), then simple regression and least-squares methods have problems; in such cases, the methodology required for fitting errors-in-variables models may be considered instead of that for least squares.

Least squares problems fall into two categories: linear or ordinary least squares and nonlinear least squares, depending on whether or not the model functions are linear in all unknowns. The linear least-squares problem occurs in statistical regression analysis; it has a closed-form solution. The nonlinear problem is usually solved by iterative refinement; at each iteration the system is approximated by a linear one, and thus the core calculation is similar in both cases.

Polynomial least squares describes the variance in a prediction of the dependent variable as a function of the independent variable and the deviations from the fitted curve.

When the observations come from an exponential family with identity as its natural sufficient statistics and mild-conditions are satisfied (e.g. for normal, exponential, Poisson and binomial distributions), standardized least-squares estimates and maximum-likelihood estimates are identical. The method of least squares can also be derived as a method of moments estimator.

The following discussion is mostly presented in terms of linear functions but the use of least squares is valid and practical for more general families of functions. Also, by iteratively applying local quadratic approximation to the likelihood (through the Fisher information), the least-squares method may be used to fit a generalized linear model.

The least-squares method was officially discovered and published by Adrien-Marie Legendre (1805), though it is usually also co-credited to Carl Friedrich Gauss (1809), who contributed significant theoretical advances to the method, and may have also used it in his earlier work in 1794 and 1795.

==History==

===Founding===
The method of least squares grew out of the fields of astronomy and geodesy, as scientists and mathematicians sought to provide solutions to the challenges of navigating the Earth&#x27;s oceans during the Age of Discovery. The accurate description of the behavior of celestial bodies was the key to enabling ships to sail in open seas, where sailors could no longer rely on land sightings for navigation.

The method was the culmination of several advances that took place during the course of the eighteenth century:

*The combination of different observations as being the best estimate of the true value; errors decrease with aggregation rather than increase, first appeared in Isaac Newton&#x27;s work in 1671, though it went unpublished, and again in 1700. It was perhaps first expressed formally by Roger Cotes in 1722.
*The combination of different observations taken under the &quot;same&quot; conditions contrary to simply trying one&#x27;s best to observe and record a single observation accurately. The approach was known as the method of averages. This approach was notably used by Newton while studying equinoxes in 1700, also writing down the first of the &#x27;normal equations&#x27; known from ordinary least squares, Tobias Mayer while studying the librations of the Moon in 1750, and by Pierre-Simon Laplace in his work in explaining the differences in motion of Jupiter and Saturn in 1788.
*The combination of different observations taken under conditions. The method came to be known as the method of &quot;least absolute deviation&quot;. It was notably performed by Roger Joseph Boscovich in his work on the shape of the Earth in 1757 and by Pierre-Simon Laplace for the same problem in 1789 and 1799.
*The development of a criterion that can be evaluated to determine when the solution with the minimum error has been achieved. Laplace tried to specify a mathematical form of the probability density for the errors and define a method of estimation that minimizes the error of estimation. For this purpose, Laplace used a symmetric two-sided exponential distribution we now call Laplace distribution to model the error distribution, and used the sum of absolute deviation as error of estimation. He felt these to be the simplest assumptions he could make, and he had hoped to obtain the arithmetic mean as the best estimate. Instead, his estimator was the posterior median.

===The method===
The first clear and concise exposition of the method of least squares was published by Legendre in 1805. The technique is described as an algebraic procedure for fitting linear equations to data and Legendre demonstrates the new method by analyzing the same data as Laplace for the shape of the Earth. Within ten years after Legendre&#x27;s publication, the method of least squares had been adopted as a standard tool in astronomy and geodesy in France, Italy, and Prussia, which constitutes an extraordinarily rapid acceptance of a scientific technique.

In 1809 Carl Friedrich Gauss published his method of calculating the orbits of celestial bodies. In that work he claimed to have been in possession of the method of least squares since 1795. This naturally led to a priority dispute with Legendre. However, to Gauss&#x27;s credit, he went beyond Legendre and succeeded in connecting the method of least squares with the principles of probability and to the normal distribution. He had managed to complete Laplace&#x27;s program of specifying a mathematical form of the probability density for the observations, depending on a finite number of unknown parameters, and define a method of estimation that minimizes the error of estimation. Gauss showed that the arithmetic mean is indeed the best estimate of the location parameter by changing both the probability density and the method of estimation. He then turned the problem around by asking what form the density should have and what method of estimation should be used to get the arithmetic mean as estimate of the location parameter. In this attempt, he invented the normal distribution.

An early demonstration of the strength of Gauss&#x27;s method came when it was used to predict the future location of the newly discovered asteroid Ceres. On 1 January 1801, the Italian astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi discovered Ceres and was able to track its path for 40 days before it was lost in the glare of the Sun. Based on these data, astronomers desired to determine the location of Ceres after it emerged from behind the Sun without solving Kepler&#x27;s complicated nonlinear equations of planetary motion. The only predictions that successfully allowed Hungarian astronomer Franz Xaver von Zach to relocate Ceres were those performed by the 24-year-old Gauss using least-squares analysis.

In 1810, after reading Gauss&#x27;s work, Laplace, after proving the central limit theorem, used it to give a large sample justification for the method of least squares and the normal distribution. In 1822, Gauss was able to state that the least-squares approach to regression analysis is optimal in the sense that in a linear model where the errors have a mean of zero, are uncorrelated, normally distributed, and have equal variances, the best linear unbiased estimator of the coefficients is the least-squares estimator. An extended version of this result is known as the Gauss–Markov theorem.

The idea of least-squares analysis was also independently formulated by the American Robert Adrain in 1808. In the next two centuries workers in the theory of errors and in statistics found many different ways of implementing least squares.

==Problem statement==
The objective consists of adjusting the parameters of a model function to best fit a data set. A simple data set consists of &quot;n&quot; points (data pairs) formula_1, &quot;i&quot; = 1, …, &quot;n&quot;, where formula_2 is an independent variable and formula_3 is a dependent variable whose value is found by observation. The model function has the form formula_4, where &quot;m&quot; adjustable parameters are held in the vector formula_5. The goal is to find the parameter values for the model that &quot;best&quot; fits the data. The fit of a model to a data point is measured by its residual, defined as the difference between the observed value of the dependent variable and the value predicted by the model: 
formula_6
The least-squares method finds the optimal parameter values by minimizing the sum of squared residuals, formula_7:
formula_8

In the simplest case formula_9 and the result of the least-squares method is the arithmetic mean of the input data.

An example of a model in two dimensions is that of the straight line. Denoting the y-intercept as formula_10 and the slope as formula_11, the model function is given by formula_12. See linear least squares for a fully worked out example of this model.

A data point may consist of more than one independent variable. For example, when fitting a plane to a set of height measurements, the plane is a function of two independent variables, &quot;x&quot; and &quot;z&quot;, say. In the most general case there may be one or more independent variables and one or more dependent variables at each data point. 

To the right is a residual plot illustrating random fluctuations about formula_13, indicating that a linear modelformula_14 is appropriate. formula_15 is an independent, random variable.   

If the residual points had some sort of a shape and were not randomly fluctuating, a linear model would not be appropriate. For example, if the residual plot had a parabolic shape as seen to the right, a parabolic model formula_16 would be appropriate for the data. The residuals for a parabolic model can be calculated via formula_17. 

==Limitations==
This regression formulation considers only observational errors in the dependent variable (but the alternative total least squares regression can account for errors in both variables). There are two rather different contexts with different implications:

*Regression for prediction. Here a model is fitted to provide a prediction rule for application in a similar situation to which the data used for fitting apply. Here the dependent variables corresponding to such future application would be subject to the same types of observation error as those in the data used for fitting. It is therefore logically consistent to use the least-squares prediction rule for such data.
*Regression for fitting a &quot;true relationship&quot;. In standard regression analysis that leads to fitting by least squares there is an implicit assumption that errors in the independent variable are zero or strictly controlled so as to be negligible. When errors in the independent variable are non-negligible, models of measurement error can be used; such methods can lead to parameter estimates, hypothesis testing and confidence intervals that take into account the presence of observation errors in the independent variables. An alternative approach is to fit a model by total least squares; this can be viewed as taking a pragmatic approach to balancing the effects of the different sources of error in formulating an objective function for use in model-fitting.

==Solving the least squares problem==
The minimum of the sum of squares is found by setting the gradient to zero. Since the model contains &quot;m&quot; parameters, there are &quot;m&quot; gradient equations:
formula_18
and since formula_19, the gradient equations become
formula_20

The gradient equations apply to all least squares problems. Each particular problem requires particular expressions for the model and its partial derivatives.

===Linear least squares===
A regression model is a linear one when the model comprises a linear combination of the parameters, i.e.,
formula_21
where the function formula_22 is a function of formula_23.

Letting formula_24 and putting the independent and dependent variables in matrices formula_25 and formula_26, respectively, we can compute the least squares in the following way. Note that formula_27 is the set of all data.
formula_28formula_29

The gradient of the loss is:
formula_30

Setting the gradient of the loss to zero and solving for formula_31, we get: 
formula_32
formula_33

===Non-linear least squares===
There is, in some cases, a closed-form solution to a non-linear least squares problem – but in general there is not. In the case of no closed-form solution, numerical algorithms are used to find the value of the parameters formula_34 that minimizes the objective. Most algorithms involve choosing initial values for the parameters. Then, the parameters are refined iteratively, that is, the values are obtained by successive approximation:
formula_35
where a superscript &quot;k&quot; is an iteration number, and the vector of increments formula_36 is called the shift vector. In some commonly used algorithms, at each iteration the model may be linearized by approximation to a first-order Taylor series expansion about formula_37:
formula_38

The Jacobian J is a function of constants, the independent variable &quot;and&quot; the parameters, so it changes from one iteration to the next. The residuals are given by
formula_39

To minimize the sum of squares of formula_40, the gradient equation is set to zero and solved for formula_41:
formula_42
which, on rearrangement, become &quot;m&quot; simultaneous linear equations, the normal equations:
formula_43

The normal equations are written in matrix notation as
formula_44
These are the defining equations of the Gauss–Newton algorithm.

===Differences between linear and nonlinear least squares===
* The model function, &quot;f&quot;, in LLSQ (linear least squares) is a linear combination of parameters of the form formula_45 The model may represent a straight line, a parabola or any other linear combination of functions. In NLLSQ (nonlinear least squares) the parameters appear as functions, such as formula_46 and so forth. If the derivatives formula_47 are either constant or depend only on the values of the independent variable, the model is linear in the parameters. Otherwise, the model is nonlinear.
*Need initial values for the parameters to find the solution to a NLLSQ problem; LLSQ does not require them. 
*Solution algorithms for NLLSQ often require that the Jacobian can be calculated similar to LLSQ. Analytical expressions for the partial derivatives can be complicated. If analytical expressions are impossible to obtain either the partial derivatives must be calculated by numerical approximation or an estimate must be made of the Jacobian, often via finite differences.
*Non-convergence (failure of the algorithm to find a minimum) is a common phenomenon in NLLSQ.
*LLSQ is globally concave so non-convergence is not an issue.
*Solving NLLSQ is usually an iterative process which has to be terminated when a convergence criterion is satisfied. LLSQ solutions can be computed using direct methods, although problems with large numbers of parameters are typically solved with iterative methods, such as the Gauss–Seidel method.
*In LLSQ the solution is unique, but in NLLSQ there may be multiple minima in the sum of squares.
*Under the condition that the errors are uncorrelated with the predictor variables, LLSQ yields unbiased estimates, but even under that condition NLLSQ estimates are generally biased.
These differences must be considered whenever the solution to a nonlinear least squares problem is being sought.

==Example==

Consider a simple example drawn from physics. A spring should obey Hooke&#x27;s law which states that the extension of a spring is proportional to the force, &quot;F&quot;, applied to it.
formula_48
constitutes the model, where &quot;F&quot; is the independent variable. In order to estimate the force constant, &quot;k&quot;, we conduct a series of &quot;n&quot; measurements with different forces to produce a set of data, formula_49, where &quot;yi&quot; is a measured spring extension. Each experimental observation will contain some error, formula_50, and so we may specify an empirical model for our observations,
formula_51

There are many methods we might use to estimate the unknown parameter &quot;k&quot;. Since the &quot;n&quot; equations in the &quot;m&quot; variables in our data comprise an overdetermined system with one unknown and &quot;n&quot; equations, we estimate &quot;k&quot; using least squares. The sum of squares to be minimized is
formula_52

The least squares estimate of the force constant, &quot;k&quot;, is given by
formula_53

We assume that applying force causes the spring to expand. After having derived the force constant by least squares fitting, we predict the extension from Hooke&#x27;s law. 

==Uncertainty quantification==
In a least squares calculation with unit weights, or in linear regression, the variance on the &quot;j&quot;th parameter, denoted formula_54, is usually estimated with
formula_55
formula_56
formula_57
where the true error variance &quot;σ&quot;2 is replaced by an estimate, the reduced chi-squared statistic, based on the minimized value of the residual sum of squares (objective function), &quot;S&quot;. The denominator, &quot;n&quot; − &quot;m&quot;, is the statistical degrees of freedom; see effective degrees of freedom for generalizations. &quot;C&quot; is the covariance matrix.

==Statistical testing==
If the probability distribution of the parameters is known or an asymptotic approximation is made, confidence limits can be found. Similarly, statistical tests on the residuals can be conducted if the probability distribution of the residuals is known or assumed. We can derive the probability distribution of any linear combination of the dependent variables if the probability distribution of experimental errors is known or assumed. Inferring is easy when assuming that the errors follow a normal distribution, consequently implying that the parameter estimates and residuals will also be normally distributed conditional on the values of the independent variables.

It is necessary to make assumptions about the nature of the experimental errors to test the results statistically. A common assumption is that the errors belong to a normal distribution. The central limit theorem supports the idea that this is a good approximation in many cases.

* The Gauss–Markov theorem. In a linear model in which the errors have expectation zero conditional on the independent variables, are uncorrelated and have equal variances, the best linear unbiased estimator of any linear combination of the observations, is its least-squares estimator. &quot;Best&quot; means that the least squares estimators of the parameters have minimum variance. The assumption of equal variance is valid when the errors all belong to the same distribution.
*If the errors belong to a normal distribution, the least-squares estimators are also the maximum likelihood estimators in a linear model.

However, suppose the errors are not normally distributed. In that case, a central limit theorem often nonetheless implies that the parameter estimates will be approximately normally distributed so long as the sample is reasonably large. For this reason, given the important property that the error mean is independent of the independent variables, the distribution of the error term is not an important issue in regression analysis. Specifically, it is not typically important whether the error term follows a normal distribution.

==Weighted least squares==

A special case of generalized least squares called weighted least squares occurs when all the off-diagonal entries of Ω (the correlation matrix of the residuals) are null; the variances of the observations (along the covariance matrix diagonal) may still be unequal (heteroscedasticity). In simpler terms, heteroscedasticity is when the variance of formula_58 depends on the value of formula_59 which causes the residual plot to create a &quot;fanning out&quot; effect towards larger formula_58 values as seen in the residual plot to the right. On the other hand, homoscedasticity is assuming that the variance of formula_58 and variance of formula_15 are equal.  
==Relationship to principal components==
The first principal component about the mean of a set of points can be represented by that line which most closely approaches the data points (as measured by squared distance of closest approach, i.e. perpendicular to the line). In contrast, linear least squares tries to minimize the distance in the formula_63 direction only. Thus, although the two use a similar error metric, linear least squares is a method that treats one dimension of the data preferentially, while PCA treats all dimensions equally.

==Relationship to measure theory==
Notable statistician Sara van de Geer used empirical process theory and the Vapnik–Chervonenkis dimension to prove a least-squares estimator can be interpreted as a measure on the space of square-integrable functions.

==Regularization==
===Tikhonov regularization===

In some contexts, a regularized version of the least squares solution may be preferable. Tikhonov regularization (or ridge regression) adds a constraint that formula_64, the squared formula_65-norm of the parameter vector, is not greater than a given value to the least squares formulation, leading to a constrained minimization problem. This is equivalent to the unconstrained minimization problem where the objective function is the residual sum of squares plus a penalty term formula_66 and formula_67 is a tuning parameter (this is the Lagrangian form of the constrained minimization problem).

In a Bayesian context, this is equivalent to placing a zero-mean normally distributed prior on the parameter vector.

===Lasso method===
An alternative regularized version of least squares is Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), which uses the constraint that formula_68, the L1-norm of the parameter vector, is no greater than a given value. (One can show like above using Lagrange multipliers that this is equivalent to an unconstrained minimization of the least-squares penalty with formula_69 added.) In a Bayesian context, this is equivalent to placing a zero-mean Laplace prior distribution on the parameter vector. The optimization problem may be solved using quadratic programming or more general convex optimization methods, as well as by specific algorithms such as the least angle regression algorithm.

One of the prime differences between Lasso and ridge regression is that in ridge regression, as the penalty is increased, all parameters are reduced while still remaining non-zero, while in Lasso, increasing the penalty will cause more and more of the parameters to be driven to zero. This is an advantage of Lasso over ridge regression, as driving parameters to zero deselects the features from the regression. Thus, Lasso automatically selects more relevant features and discards the others, whereas Ridge regression never fully discards any features. Some feature selection techniques are developed based on the LASSO including Bolasso which bootstraps samples, and FeaLect which analyzes the regression coefficients corresponding to different values of formula_67 to score all the features.

The &quot;L&quot;1-regularized formulation is useful in some contexts due to its tendency to prefer solutions where more parameters are zero, which gives solutions that depend on fewer variables. For this reason, the Lasso and its variants are fundamental to the field of compressed sensing. An extension of this approach is elastic net regularization.

<text>Merneferre Ay (also spelled Aya or Eje, sometimes known as Ay I) was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh of the mid 13th Dynasty. The longest reigning pharaoh of the 13th Dynasty, he ruled a likely fragmented Egypt for over 23 years in the early to mid 17th century BC. A pyramidion bearing his name shows that he possibly completed a pyramid, probably located in the necropolis of Memphis.

Merneferre Ay is the last pharaoh of the 13th Dynasty to be attested outside Upper Egypt. In spite of his long reign, the number of artefacts attributable to him is comparatively small. This may point to problems in Egypt at the time and indeed, by the end of his reign, &quot;the administration [of the Egyptian state] seems to have completely collapsed&quot;. It is possible that the capital of Egypt since the early Middle Kingdom, Itjtawy was abandoned during or shortly after Ay&#x27;s reign. For this reason, some scholars consider Merneferre Ay to be the last pharaoh of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt.

==Chronology==

===Chronological position===

The relative chronological position of Merneferre Ay as a king of the mid 13th Dynasty is well established by the Turin canon, a king list redacted during the early Ramesside period (1292–1069 BC) and which serves as the primary historical source for the Second Intermediate Period. The king list records Ay&#x27;s name on column 8 line 3 (column 6 line 3 in Alan Gardiner&#x27;s reading of the Turin canon and entry 7.3 in von Beckerath&#x27;s reading) and establishes that Merneferre Ay was preceded by Wahibre Ibiau and succeeded by Merhotepre Ini, who was possibly his son.

The precise chronological placement of Merneferre Ay varies between scholars, with Jürgen von Beckerath and Aidan Dodson seeing him as the 27th king of the dynasty while Kim Ryholt and Darrell Baker place him in the 32nd and 33rd positions, respectively. Similarly, the absolute datation of Ay&#x27;s reign is debated and varies by 17 years between Ryholt&#x27;s 1701–1677 BC and Schneider&#x27;s 1684–1661 BC.

===Reign length===
Until recently, the duration of Merneferre Ay&#x27;s reign, which is recorded in the Turin canon, was disputed by Jürgen von Beckerath who read the damaged figure on the papyrus fragment as 13 years while both Alan Gardiner and Kenneth Kitchen maintained it should be read as 23 years. The dispute was settled in the latest study of the Turin canon by Kim Ryholt who confirms that Merneferre Ay&#x27;s reign length as recorded on the papyrus is &quot;23 years, 8 months and 18 days&quot;.
Ryholt insists that &quot;the tick that distinguishes 20 and 30 from 10 is preserved and beyond dispute. Accordingly, 23 years or, less likely, 33 years must be read.&quot; This makes Merneferre Ay the longest-ruling pharaoh of the 13th Dynasty at a time when numerous short-lived kings ruled Egypt.

==Reign and attestations==

As a king of the mid 13th Dynasty, Merneferre Ay reigned over Middle and Upper Egypt concurrently with the 14th Dynasty, which controlled at least the Eastern Nile Delta. The egyptologists Kim Ryholt and Darrell Baker contend that Mernferre usurped the throne at the expense of his predecessor Wahibre Ibiau. They base this conclusion on the total absence of filiative nomina, that is references to the name of his father on the artefacts attributable to him. They believe that this should have been the case had his father been a pharaoh, and indeed a number of 13th Dynasty kings used filiative nomina. Little is known of Ay&#x27;s consorts, he was possibly married to Ineni whose scarabs are stylistically similar to those of Ay.

===Attestations===
Merneferre Ay is well attested; no fewer than 62 scarab seals and one cylinder-seal bearing his name are known, 51 of which are of unknown provenance Among the scarabs of known provenance, three are from Lower Egypt, more precisely one from Bubastis and two from Heliopolis. The rest of the scarabs of known provenance are from Abydos, Coptos and Lisht, all localities being in Middle or Upper Egypt. Other attestations of Ay include an obsidian globular jar now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, a ball dedicated to Sobek, an inscribed limestone block, part of a lintel, discovered in 1908 by Georges Legrain in Karnak and a pyramidion.

The pyramidion was confiscated from robbers by the Egyptian police in 1911 at Faqus, close to the ancient city of Avaris. It is carved with the name of Ay and shows him offering to Horus &quot;Lord of heaven&quot;, demonstrating that a pyramid was built for him during his long reign. The fact that the pyramidion was probably discovered by the robbers in modern-day Khatana, part of the ancient city of Avaris (modern-day Qantir) is important since it was likely the capital of the 14th Dynasty during Ay&#x27;s lifetime. Egyptologists believe that the pyramidion originates in fact from Memphis, in the necropolis of which Ay&#x27;s pyramid must be located. Accordingly, this suggests that the pyramid was looted at the time of the Hyksos invasion c. 1650 BC and the pyramidion taken to Avaris at this moment. This is vindicated by the &quot;damaged text on the pyramidion [which] originally invoked four gods&quot; two of whom were Ptah and Re-Horus (for Ra-Horakhty). The cults of these gods were based in the Memphite necropolis, not in Avaris. Other objects which suffered the same fate include two colossal statues of the 13th Dynasty king Imyremeshaw.

==Legacy==

Even though Merneferre Ay is well attested, the number of objects attributable to him is relatively small given his nearly 24 year-long reign. This may point to serious problems in Egypt at the time and indeed Ryholt and others believe that by the end of Ay&#x27;s reign &quot;the administration [of the Egyptian state] seems to have completely collapsed&quot;.

Merneferre Ay is the last Egyptian king of the 13th Dynasty who is attested by objects from outside of Upper Egypt. This may indicate the abandonment of the old capital of the Middle Kingdom Itjtawy in favor of Thebes. Daphna Ben Tor believes that this event was triggered by the invasion of the eastern Delta and the Memphite region by Canaanite rulers. Indeed some egyptologists believe that by the end of Ay&#x27;s reign the 13th dynasty had lost control of Lower Egypt, including the Delta region and possibly Memphis itself. For these authors, this marks the end of the Middle Kingdom and the beginning of the Second Intermediate Period. This analysis is rejected by Ryholt and Baker however, who note that the stele of Seheqenre Sankhptahi, reigning toward the very end of the 13th Dynasty, strongly suggests that he reigned over Memphis. Unfortunately, the stele is of unknown provenance.

<text>In mathematics, particularly linear algebra and numerical analysis, the Gram–Schmidt process or Gram-Schmidt algorithm is a way of finding a set of two or more vectors that are perpendicular to each other.

By technical definition, it is a method of constructing an orthonormal basis from a set of vectors in an inner product space, most commonly the Euclidean space formula_1 equipped with the standard inner product. The Gram–Schmidt process takes a finite, linearly independent set of vectors formula_2 for and generates an orthogonal set formula_3 that spans the same formula_4-dimensional subspace of formula_1 as formula_6.

The method is named after Jørgen Pedersen Gram and Erhard Schmidt, but Pierre-Simon Laplace had been familiar with it before Gram and Schmidt. In the theory of Lie group decompositions, it is generalized by the Iwasawa decomposition.

The application of the Gram–Schmidt process to the column vectors of a full column rank matrix yields the QR decomposition (it is decomposed into an orthogonal and a triangular matrix).

== The Gram–Schmidt process ==
The vector projection of a vector formula_7 on a nonzero vector formula_8 is defined as
formula_9
where formula_10 denotes the inner product of the vectors formula_8 and formula_7. This means that formula_13 is the orthogonal projection of formula_7 onto the line spanned by formula_8. If formula_8 is the zero vector, then formula_13 is defined as the zero vector.

Given formula_4 vectors formula_19 the Gram–Schmidt process defines the vectors formula_20 as follows:
formula_21

The sequence formula_20 is the required system of orthogonal vectors, and the normalized vectors formula_23 form an orthonormal set. The calculation of the sequence formula_20 is known as &quot;Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization&quot;, and the calculation of the sequence formula_23 is known as &quot;Gram–Schmidt orthonormalization&quot;.

To check that these formulas yield an orthogonal sequence, first compute formula_26 by substituting the above formula for formula_27: we get zero. Then use this to compute formula_28 again by substituting the formula for formula_29: we get zero. For arbitrary formula_4 the proof is accomplished by mathematical induction.

Geometrically, this method proceeds as follows: to compute formula_31, it projects formula_32 orthogonally onto the subspace formula_33 generated by formula_34, which is the same as the subspace generated by formula_35. The vector formula_31 is then defined to be the difference between formula_32 and this projection, guaranteed to be orthogonal to all of the vectors in the subspace formula_33.

The Gram–Schmidt process also applies to a linearly independent countably infinite sequence . The result is an orthogonal (or orthonormal) sequence such that for natural number : the algebraic span of formula_39 is the same as that of formula_40.

If the Gram–Schmidt process is applied to a linearly dependent sequence, it outputs the vector on the formula_41th step, assuming that formula_32 is a linear combination of formula_35. If an orthonormal basis is to be produced, then the algorithm should test for zero vectors in the output and discard them because no multiple of a zero vector can have a length of 1. The number of vectors output by the algorithm will then be the dimension of the space spanned by the original inputs.

A variant of the Gram–Schmidt process using transfinite recursion applied to a (possibly uncountably) infinite sequence of vectors formula_44 yields a set of orthonormal vectors formula_45 with formula_46 such that for any formula_47, the completion of the span of formula_48 is the same as that of In particular, when applied to a (algebraic) basis of a Hilbert space (or, more generally, a basis of any dense subspace), it yields a (functional-analytic) orthonormal basis. Note that in the general case often the strict inequality formula_49 holds, even if the starting set was linearly independent, and the span of formula_45 need not be a subspace of the span of formula_44 (rather, it&#x27;s a subspace of its completion).

== Example ==

===Euclidean space===
Consider the following set of vectors in formula_52 (with the conventional inner product)
formula_53

Now, perform Gram–Schmidt, to obtain an orthogonal set of vectors:
formula_54
formula_55

We check that the vectors formula_56 and formula_27 are indeed orthogonal:
formula_58
noting that if the dot product of two vectors is 0 then they are orthogonal.

For non-zero vectors, we can then normalize the vectors by dividing out their sizes as shown above:
formula_59
formula_60

== Properties ==

Denote by formula_61 the result of applying the Gram–Schmidt process to a collection of vectors formula_62. This yields a map formula_63.

It has the following properties:

* It is continuous
* It is orientation preserving in the sense that formula_64.
* It commutes with orthogonal maps:

Let formula_65 be orthogonal (with respect to the given inner product). Then we have
formula_66

Further, a parametrized version of the Gram–Schmidt process yields a (strong) deformation retraction of the general linear group formula_67 onto the orthogonal group formula_68.

== Numerical stability ==
When this process is implemented on a computer, the vectors formula_69 are often not quite orthogonal, due to rounding errors. For the Gram–Schmidt process as described above (sometimes referred to as &quot;classical Gram–Schmidt&quot;) this loss of orthogonality is particularly bad; therefore, it is said that the (classical) Gram–Schmidt process is numerically unstable.

The Gram–Schmidt process can be stabilized by a small modification; this version is sometimes referred to as modified Gram-Schmidt or MGS. This approach gives the same result as the original formula in exact arithmetic and introduces smaller errors in finite-precision arithmetic.

Instead of computing the vector as
formula_70
it is computed as
formula_71

This method is used in the previous animation, when the intermediate formula_72 vector is used when orthogonalizing the blue vector formula_73.

Here is another description of the modified algorithm. Given the vectors formula_74, in our first step we produce vectors formula_75by removing components along the direction of formula_76. In formulas, formula_77. After this step we already have two of our desired orthogonal vectors formula_78, namely formula_79, but we also made formula_80 already orthogonal to formula_56. Next, we orthogonalize those remaining vectors against formula_82. This means we compute formula_83 by subtraction formula_84. Now we have stored the vectors formula_85 where the first three vectors are already formula_86 and the remaining vectors are already orthogonal to formula_87. As should be clear now, the next step orthogonalizes formula_88 against formula_89. Proceeding in this manner we find the full set of orthogonal vectors formula_78. If orthonormal vectors are desired, then we normalize as we go, so that the denominators in the subtraction formulas turn into ones.

== Algorithm ==
The following MATLAB algorithm implements classical Gram–Schmidt orthonormalization. The vectors (columns of matrix codice_1, so that codice_2 is the formula_91th vector) are replaced by orthonormal vectors (columns of codice_3) which span the same subspace.
function U = gramschmidt(V)
 [n, k] = size(V);
 U = zeros(n,k);
 U(:,1) = V(:,1) / norm(V(:,1));
 for i = 2:k
 U(:,i) = V(:,i);
 for j = 1:i-1
 U(:,i) = U(:,i) - (U(:,j)&#x27;*U(:,i)) * U(:,j);
 end
 U(:,i) = U(:,i) / norm(U(:,i));
 end
end
The cost of this algorithm is asymptotically floating point operations, where is the dimensionality of the vectors.

== Via Gaussian elimination ==

If the rows are written as a matrix formula_92, then applying Gaussian elimination to the augmented matrix formula_93 will produce the orthogonalized vectors in place of formula_92. However the matrix formula_95 must be brought to row echelon form, using only the row operation of adding a scalar multiple of one row to another. For example, taking formula_96 as above, we have
formula_97

And reducing this to row echelon form produces
formula_98

The normalized vectors are then
formula_99
formula_100
as in the example above.

== Determinant formula ==
The result of the Gram–Schmidt process may be expressed in a non-recursive formula using determinants.

formula_101

formula_102

where formula_103 and, for formula_104, formula_105 is the Gram determinant

formula_106

Note that the expression for formula_69 is a &quot;formal&quot; determinant, i.e. the matrix contains both scalars and vectors; the meaning of this expression is defined to be the result of a cofactor expansion along the row of vectors.

The determinant formula for the Gram-Schmidt is computationally (exponentially) slower than the recursive algorithms described above; it is mainly of theoretical interest.

== Expressed using geometric algebra ==
Expressed using notation used in geometric algebra, the unnormalized results of the Gram–Schmidt process can be expressed as
formula_108
which is equivalent to the expression using the formula_109 operator defined above. The results can equivalently be expressed as
formula_110
which is closely related to the expression using determinants above.

== Alternatives ==
Other orthogonalization algorithms use Householder transformations or Givens rotations. The algorithms using Householder transformations are more stable than the stabilized Gram–Schmidt process. On the other hand, the Gram–Schmidt process produces the formula_91th orthogonalized vector after the formula_91th iteration, while orthogonalization using Householder reflections produces all the vectors only at the end. This makes only the Gram–Schmidt process applicable for iterative methods like the Arnoldi iteration.

Yet another alternative is motivated by the use of Cholesky decomposition for inverting the matrix of the normal equations in linear least squares. Let formula_113 be a full column rank matrix, whose columns need to be orthogonalized. The matrix formula_114 is Hermitian and positive definite, so it can be written as formula_115 using the Cholesky decomposition. The lower triangular matrix formula_116 with strictly positive diagonal entries is invertible. Then columns of the matrix formula_117 are orthonormal and span the same subspace as the columns of the original matrix formula_113. The explicit use of the product formula_114 makes the algorithm unstable, especially if the product&#x27;s condition number is large. Nevertheless, this algorithm is used in practice and implemented in some software packages because of its high efficiency and simplicity.

In quantum mechanics there are several orthogonalization schemes with characteristics better suited for certain applications than original Gram–Schmidt. Nevertheless, it remains a popular and effective algorithm for even the largest electronic structure calculations.

== Run-time complexity ==
Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization can be done in strongly-polynomial time. The run-time analysis is similar to that of Gaussian elimination.

<doc id="82365" wikidata="Q208395" url="?curid=82365" title="Spheroid">
<text>A spheroid, also known as an ellipsoid of revolution or rotational ellipsoid, is a quadric surface obtained by rotating an ellipse about one of its principal axes; in other words, an ellipsoid with two equal semi-diameters. A spheroid has circular symmetry.

If the ellipse is rotated about its major axis, the result is a prolate spheroid, elongated like a rugby ball. The American football is similar but has a pointier end than a spheroid could. If the ellipse is rotated about its minor axis, the result is an oblate spheroid, flattened like a lentil or a plain M&amp;M. If the generating ellipse is a circle, the result is a sphere.

Due to the combined effects of gravity and rotation, the figure of the Earth (and of all planets) is not quite a sphere, but instead is slightly flattened in the direction of its axis of rotation. For that reason, in cartography and geodesy the Earth is often approximated by an oblate spheroid, known as the reference ellipsoid, instead of a sphere. The current World Geodetic System model uses a spheroid whose radius is at the Equator and at the poles.

The word &quot;spheroid&quot; originally meant &quot;an approximately spherical body&quot;, admitting irregularities even beyond the bi- or tri-axial ellipsoidal shape; that is how the term is used in some older papers on geodesy (for example, referring to truncated spherical harmonic expansions of the Earth&#x27;s gravity geopotential model).

==Equation==

The equation of a tri-axial ellipsoid centred at the origin with semi-axes , and aligned along the coordinate axes is
:formula_1

The equation of a spheroid with as the symmetry axis is given by setting :
:formula_2

The semi-axis is the equatorial radius of the spheroid, and is the distance from centre to pole along the symmetry axis. There are two possible cases:
* : oblate spheroid
* : prolate spheroid
The case of reduces to a sphere.

==Properties==
===Circumference===
The equatorial circumference of a spheroid is measured around its equator and is given as:
:formula_3
The meridional or polar circumference of a spheroid is measured through its poles and is given as:
formula_4
The volumetric circumference of a spheroid is the circumference of a sphere of equal volume as the spheroid and is given as:
:formula_5

===Area===
An oblate spheroid with has surface area
:formula_6
The oblate spheroid is generated by rotation about the -axis of an ellipse with semi-major axis and semi-minor axis , therefore may be identified as the eccentricity. (See ellipse.)

A prolate spheroid with has surface area
:formula_7
The prolate spheroid is generated by rotation about the -axis of an ellipse with semi-major axis and semi-minor axis ; therefore, may again be identified as the eccentricity. (See ellipse.) 

These formulas are identical in the sense that the formula for can be used to calculate the surface area of a prolate spheroid and vice versa. However, then becomes imaginary and can no longer directly be identified with the eccentricity. Both of these results may be cast into many other forms using standard mathematical identities and relations between parameters of the ellipse.

===Volume===
The volume inside a spheroid (of any kind) is
:formula_8
If is the equatorial diameter, and is the polar diameter, the volume is
:formula_9

===Curvature===

Let a spheroid be parameterized as
:formula_10
where is the &quot;reduced latitude&quot; or &quot;parametric latitude&quot;, is the longitude, and and . Then, the spheroid&#x27;s Gaussian curvature is
:formula_11
and its mean curvature is
:formula_12

Both of these curvatures are always positive, so that every point on a spheroid is elliptic.

===Aspect ratio===
The &quot;aspect ratio&quot; of an oblate spheroid/ellipse, , is the ratio of the polar to equatorial lengths, while the &quot;flattening&quot; (also called &quot;oblateness&quot;) , is the ratio of the equatorial-polar length difference to the equatorial length:
:formula_13

The first &quot;eccentricity&quot; (usually simply eccentricity, as above) is often used instead of flattening. It is defined by:

: formula_14

The relations between eccentricity and flattening are:
: formula_15

All modern geodetic ellipsoids are defined by the semi-major axis plus either the semi-minor axis (giving the aspect ratio), the flattening, or the first eccentricity. While these definitions are mathematically interchangeable, real-world calculations must lose some precision. To avoid confusion, an ellipsoidal definition considers its own values to be exact in the form it gives.

==Occurrence and applications==
The most common shapes for the density distribution of protons and neutrons in an atomic nucleus are spherical, prolate, and oblate spheroidal, where the polar axis is assumed to be the spin axis (or direction of the spin angular momentum vector). Deformed nuclear shapes occur as a result of the competition between electromagnetic repulsion between protons, surface tension and quantum shell effects.

Spheroids are common in 3D cell cultures.
Rotating equilibrium spheroids include the Maclaurin spheroid and the Jacobi ellipsoid.
Spheroid is also a shape of archaeological artifacts.

===Oblate spheroids===

The oblate spheroid is the approximate shape of rotating planets and other celestial bodies, including Earth, Saturn, Jupiter, and the quickly spinning star Altair. Saturn is the most oblate planet in the Solar System, with a flattening of 0.09796. See planetary flattening and equatorial bulge for details.

Enlightenment scientist Isaac Newton, working from Jean Richer&#x27;s pendulum experiments and Christiaan Huygens&#x27;s theories for their interpretation, reasoned that Jupiter and Earth are oblate spheroids owing to their centrifugal force. Earth&#x27;s diverse cartographic and geodetic systems are based on reference ellipsoids, all of which are oblate.

===Prolate spheroids===

The prolate spheroid is the approximate shape of the ball in several sports, such as in the rugby ball.

Several moons of the Solar System approximate prolate spheroids in shape, though they are actually triaxial ellipsoids. Examples are Saturn&#x27;s satellites Mimas, Enceladus, and Tethys and Uranus&#x27; satellite Miranda.

In contrast to being distorted into oblate spheroids via rapid rotation, celestial objects distort slightly into prolate spheroids via tidal forces when they orbit a massive body in a close orbit. The most extreme example is Jupiter&#x27;s moon Io, which becomes slightly more or less prolate in its orbit due to a slight eccentricity, causing intense volcanism. The major axis of the prolate spheroid does not run through the satellite&#x27;s poles in this case, but through the two points on its equator directly facing toward and away from the primary. This combines with the smaller oblate distortion from the synchronous rotation to cause the body to become triaxial.

The term is also used to describe the shape of some nebulae such as the Crab Nebula. Fresnel zones, used to analyze wave propagation and interference in space, are a series of concentric prolate spheroids with principal axes aligned along the direct line-of-sight between a transmitter and a receiver.

The atomic nuclei of the actinide and lanthanide elements are shaped like prolate spheroids. In anatomy, near-spheroid organs such as testis may be measured by their long and short axes.

Many submarines have a shape which can be described as prolate spheroid.

===Dynamical properties===

For a spheroid having uniform density, the moment of inertia is that of an ellipsoid with an additional axis of symmetry. Given a description of a spheroid as having a major axis , and minor axes , the moments of inertia along these principal axes are , , and . However, in a spheroid the minor axes are symmetrical. Therefore, our inertial terms along the major axes are:

:formula_16

where is the mass of the body defined as

:formula_17

<text>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP) is a computer science textbook by Massachusetts Institute of Technology professors Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman. It is known as the &quot;Wizard Book&quot; in hacker culture. It teaches fundamental principles of computer programming, including recursion, abstraction, modularity, and programming language design and implementation.

MIT Press published the first edition in 1984, and the second edition in 1996. It was used as the textbook for MIT&#x27;s introductory course in computer science from 1984 to 2007. SICP focuses on discovering general patterns for solving specific problems, and building software systems that make use of those patterns.

MIT Press published a JavaScript version of the book in 2022.

== Coursework ==
The book was used as the textbook for MIT&#x27;s former introductory programming course, 6.001, from fall 1984 through its last semester, in fall 2007. Other schools also made use of the book as a course textbook.

== Reception ==
&quot;Byte&quot; recommended SICP in 1986 &quot;for professional programmers who are really interested in their profession&quot;. The magazine said that the book was not easy to read, but that it would expose experienced programmers to both old and new topics.

A review of SICP as an undergraduate textbook by Philip Wadler noted the weaknesses of the Scheme language as an introductory language for a computer science course. Wadler criticized in particular the lack of pattern matching, obscuring equational reasoning and making the teaching of proofs harder; the lack of algebraic data types in Scheme and the over-reliance on cons pairs for both code and data representation, which can confuse beginning students; and the choice of strict instead of lazy evaluation as the standard evaluation strategy.

== Influence ==
SICP has been influential in computer science education, and several later books have been inspired by its style.
* &quot;Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics (SICM)&quot;, another book that uses Scheme as an instructional element, by Gerald Jay Sussman and Jack Wisdom
* &quot;Software Design for Flexibility&quot;, by Chris Hanson and Gerald Jay Sussman
* &quot;How to Design Programs (HtDP)&quot;, which intends to be a more accessible book for introductory Computer Science, and to address perceived deficiencies in SICP
* &quot;Essentials of Programming Languages (EoPL)&quot;, a book for Programming Languages courses

<text>An Indy grab, also known as an Indy air, is an aerial skateboarding, snowboarding and kitesurfing trick during which the rider grabs their back hand on the middle of their board, between their feet, on the side of the board where their toes are pointing. The Indy grab is a generic skateboarding trick that has been performed since the late 1970s. This trick is performed mainly while vert skating, e.g. on halfpipes. Although this move can be done on flat land, it is much easier on a ramp. The Indy grab is one of the basic tricks in vert skating and is usually combined with spins, kickflips and heelflips.

The Indy air was originally called the Gunnair, which was invented by Gunnar Haugo in 1977. By 1980, the trick was renamed the Indy air, after the Independent Truck Company by skateboarder Duane Peters (who popularized this grab around 1980). The trick involves doing a backside air while gripping one&#x27;s board on the toe side, between the feet with the trailing hand. If the board is grabbed during a frontside air, the trick is simply called a &quot;frontside air&quot;, as opposed to a frontside ollie, in which there is no grab. Many variations have come into existence as skaters push the limits of creativity and physical exertion. Two of the most popular variations are the kickflip Indy and Indy nosebone.

The term &quot;Indy grab&quot; may also be misapplied to any aerial in which the rider grabs the toe side of their board with their trailing hand (as in snowboarding). This confusion is partly due to the name being applied to all such grabs in the &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater&quot; video game.

<text>The Europa rocket was an early expendable launch system of the European Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO), which was the precursor to the European Space Agency (ESA). It was developed with the aim to delivering space access technology, and more specifically to facilitate the deployment of European-wide telecommunication and meteorological satellites into orbit.

The program ultimately traces its history to the British Blue Streak missile, which was cancelled in 1960. Blue Streak was then used as the basis of the Black Prince expendable launch system and several other concepts. Looking for partners to share development costs, ELDO was formed and began development of the Europa using the Blue Streak first stage along with the French-built Coralie second stage and German Astris upper stage.

The programme proceeded to perform multiple test launches but these frequently resulted in partial failures. In addition, Britain decided to pull out of the ELDO organisation, and thus Europa, to focus on the rival all-British Black Arrow launcher instead. Confidence in the programme had diminished due to the poor reliability figures, and this led to its termination.

Although the UK left the programme, the other ELDO partners were still interested in a launcher. They re-formed as the European Space Agency (ESA) in 1974 and proceeded to develop the Ariane family of launchers, which would prove to be a commercial success with hundreds of launches performed.

==Development==
===Background===
During the early 1950s, the British government had identified the need to develop its own series of ballistic missiles due to advances being made in this field, particularly by the Soviet Union and the United States. A British programme to develop such a missile, named Blue Streak, was promptly initiated; however, there were key questions over the then-relatively unknown scenario of what such a vehicle would encounter when attempting re-entry to the atmosphere, there were fears that such a vehicle might simply burn up like a meteor and therefore be unachievable. Accordingly, during 1955, the Black Knight research rocket programme was commenced for this purpose. Following several launches, the Black Knight came to be regarded as a successful programme, having produced a relatively low cost and reliable rocket, and thus there was impetus present to proceed with further development of the platform.

On 13 April 1960, the Defence Minister Harold Watkinson announced the cancellation of Blue Streak as a military programme, and went on to state that: &quot;the Government will now consider with the firms and other interests concerned, as a matter of urgency, whether the Blue Streak programme could be adapted for the development of a launcher for space satellites.&quot; While development of the Blue Streak missile continued with the view of using it as a capable satellite launcher, the rate of work was substantially slowed. Aerospace author C.N. Hill wrote that this declaration had been made: &quot;Mainly, I suspect, to minimise the political damage that ensued from the [Blue Streak] decision&quot;.

In 1957, a proposed design, known as Black Prince, was put forward by Desmond King-Hele and Doreen Gilmour of the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) during 1957. As envisioned by this proposal, an expendable launch system could be developed using a mix of preexisting and in-development assets; the multi-stage launcher was to be formed of a Blue Streak first stage, a Black Knight (or later a Black Arrow) second stage, and a military solid rocket as a third stage.

In 1960, the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough was given the job of considering how the Blue Streak missile could be adapted as a satellite launching vehicle, in conjunction with other rocket stages. Accordingly, the 1957 concept design for a combined Blue Streak-Black Knight launcher was put forward once again, and this time received a favourable appraisal; the project was assigned the rainbow code of &quot;Black Prince&quot;; in official documentation, the platform was referred to as the &quot;Blue Streak Satellite Launch Vehicle&quot; (BSSLV). However, it was quickly recognised that the programme&#x27;s cost would be a major issue, one estimate of the total development costs would have been equal to half of the British university budget.

Along with the high costs involved, it was becoming clear that, due to British military satellites already being delivered by American launchers and the domestic science community being perceived as lacking the funding to conduct multiple major research satellite programmes at once, domestic demand for such a launcher was not guaranteed. Accordingly, it was decided that it would be preferable for other nations to be involved in the programme in order to share the burden of the costs and to be predisposed to making use of the launcher. Diplomatic approaches were made to various nations, however it became obvious that the members of the Commonwealth of Nations alone were not prepared to provide the necessary backing for such a programme.

===Collaboration===
As early as 1961, Peter Thorneycroft, the Minister of Aviation, had been thinking about a joint European project, in order not to waste the advanced development of the Blue Streak, and not to leave space exploration to the Americans and Russians. Britain made diplomatic approaches to various European nations: the most significant of these was to France. Overtures between the British government and the French government on potential cooperation on missile research, and specifically on the potential use of the Blue Streak as early as 1957. Britain and France agreed to serve as the lead nations on the envisioned programme, but recognised that other partner nations would be necessary.

Both France and Britain approached various other nations to join on the collaborative programme, however negotiations with interested nations were often protracted, in part due to scepticism; author C.N. Hill stated that &quot;many countries thought that the U.K. was seeking to foist an obsolescent launch vehicle on them, and making them pay the costs&quot;. The participation of many nations hinged upon gaining the endorsement of Germany, which was eventually won over and chose to participate. As a result of this diplomacy, it was decided to proceed with the formation of the European Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO) group.

The headquarters of ELDO were in Paris. The founding members were Belgium, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands and West Germany: Australia, Spain, Switzerland, Norway, and Sweden had chosen not to participate. ELDO not only served the purpose of harnessing Blue Streak, but also fulfilled ambitions to produce a European rival to the American and Soviet launchers being developed and deployed at that time. In response to the rise of the ELDO initiative, work on the competing Black Prince launcher gradually came to a halt as attention from the British government drifted towards European collaboration.

After studying various designs and concepts, ELDO arrived at a three-stage approach which was given the designation &quot;Eldo A&quot;; this was later formally named as &quot;Europa&quot;. According to Hill, Black Prince and Europa were comparable launchers, capable of delivering similar performance and roughly the same payloads; the overlap left little room for both programmes. However, there was criticisms that Europa would take longer to deliver than the Black Prince launcher for no significant improvement, while suffering from the same core economic problem of being too expensive for scientific satellites while too small for commercial communications satellites.

In January 1965, the French thought the initial three-stage rocket design would not be sufficiently advanced to carry the size of payloads required, while another rocket – referred to as &quot;Eldo B&quot; – which featured liquid hydrogen-fuelled second and third stages, came to be viewed as a superior design, partly due to reduce the cost of the project by eliminating transition test launchers. It would still use the Blue Streak as the first stage. The ELDO later disagreed, but the French would ultimately get their way when Eldo B became the foundation for the later Ariane launcher, which first launched in 1979.

===Rising costs and restructuring===
By April 1966, the project&#x27;s estimated costs had increased to £150 million from an initial estimate of £70 million. By this point, hopes amongst several of the participants were not high that Europa would be suitable for the envisioned task; the Italians wanted to abandon the ELDO and instead participate in a single European space organisation that would not be as nationally divided as the ELDO. The first launch had been originally planned for November 1966; however, the first two-stage launch occurred in August 1967, while the full three stages (Europa 1) performed its first combined launch in November 1968.

During the mid-1960s, Britain had been contributing 40 per cent of the programme&#x27;s costs. In early June 1966, the British government (Fred Mulley) decided it could not afford the cost of Europa and sought to leave the ELDO organisation – one of the few European organisations by which point it had become a lead player. Britain&#x27;s contribution was reduced to 27 per cent. This was also at a time when satellite technology was on the verge of changing the world. However, the soon-to-be-common geosynchronous satellites necessitated being positioned at an altitude of 22,000 miles (35 400 km) above Earth, which was far beyond the performance of Europa 1, being capable of launching satellites to a altitude.

In November 1968, a European Space Conference held in Bonn decided on a proposal to merge the ELDO with the ESRO, forming a pan-European space authority by early 1970; known as the European Space Agency (ESA), this organisation would not be formed until 1975. Britain was lukewarm to the idea and did not believe that Europe could launch satellites economically. By 1970, the French launch base in French Guiana had cost £45 million, and in that year France became the most important partner in the project, then planning to build two-thirds of the rocket as well as owning the launch site. Although only on paper, Britain&#x27;s involvement in the project has been much reduced, after being largely responsible (with an Australian launch site) for getting the entire project going in the first place. However, all of the launchers, to the very end of the programme, were completely dependent on the British rocket used for the first stage.

By 1970, the project was under a perceived economic threat from America&#x27;s offer to fly satellites for foreign powers on a reimbursable basis. That agreement had been signed between ESRO and NASA on 30 December 1966 and by 1970 it was becoming clear that the advantage in having a national launch vehicle was insufficient to justify the cost. In 1972, NASA approved development of the reusable Space Shuttle, which at that time was largely perceived to eventually offer greater savings over the launching of satellites using an expendable system. These hopes the Shuttle delivering lower costs would ultimately prove to be hollow. By 1971, over £250 million had been spent on the Europa programme; the Europa 2 itself cost over £4 million.

On 27 April 1973, Europa was abandoned. On 21 September 1973, the legal agreement for the L3S, which later became known as the Ariane 1, was signed. Under this agreement, the Europa III was formally cancelled, while the L3S would be developed as a multinational project. From the onset, this new launcher was to be developed for the purpose of sending commercial satellites into geosynchronous orbit, unlike many other competing launchers, which had been typically developed for other purposes and subsequently adapted, such as ballistic missiles.

===Division of labour===

Workshare on the programme was a politically charged matter. Tasks were to be distributed between nations: the United Kingdom would provide the first stage (derived from the Blue Streak missile), France would build the second and Germany would construct the third stage. It would carry a satellite, which would be designed and manufactured in Italy, and weighted roughly a ton. The telemetry was to be developed by the Netherlands, while Belgium was to develop the downrange ground guidance system.

By 1969, the ELDO was beginning to realize that dividing work up by country led to not enough overall collaboration and had resulted in a disjointed framework of planning. This disjointed structure has been accredited as having been responsible for the lack of successful launch. In effect, there had been no single authority or group that was entirely responsible or in control of Europa. Notably, in November 1971, the West Germans publicly blamed the failure and explosion of Europa 2 upon immense divisions within ELDO.

===Programme stages===

The Europa programme was divided into 4 separate projects intended to follow each other in succession. Ultimately, only two of these projects would have any launches conducted, the third project being cancelled while the fourth remained a case study only:

* Europa 1: 4 unsuccessful launches
* Europa 2: 1 unsuccessful launch
* Europa 3: Cancelled before any launch occurred
* Europa 4: Study only, later cancelled

==Versions==

Born out of the cooperation between multiple countries, the first version was named ELDO-A and then Europa 1, and was composed of three stages:

* &quot;Blue Streak&quot; first stage, built by Britain,
* &quot;Coralie&quot; second stage, built by France,
* &quot;Astris&quot; third stage, built by Germany.

The second version named Europa 2 was financed by France and Germany. This configuration added a fourth stage derived from Diamant BP4 third stage.

A third version named Europa 3 was studied in the 1970s. The project was abandoned, but its planned first stage was the basis of Ariane.

== Design ==

===Payloads===
The payload for the rocket was overseen by the European Space Research Organization – ESRO. Satellites were proposed to be launched by 1969 or 1970, in a circular polar orbit at an altitude of . ESRO organised the development of early satellites such as ESRO 2B (Iris), built by Hawker Siddeley Dynamics and Engins Matra.

In 1967, it was decided the payloads were to be launched by 1970 from French Guiana, not Australia. In April 1969, Britain decided to invest in a satellite television project by the European Broadcasting Union.

By the early 1970s the French-German Symphonie communications satellite were in production, but by then Europa was cancelled in November 1971.

===First stage===
The &quot;Blue Streak&quot; first stage was tested three times in 1964, and also in 1965, with dummy upper stages in 1965. It was assisted by the British National Committee for Space Research. The chief project engineer of the rocket&#x27;s assembly at the space projects division of Hawker Siddeley Dynamics was Dr Geoffrey Pardoe, also the project manager of Blue Streak from 1956 to 1960 (when under de Havilland). In August 1965, the Blue Streak was tested (static firing trial) with (complete full-weight) dummy upper stages at RAF Spadeadam (the site was owned by Rolls-Royce), with first successful firing on 23 September 1965 lasting 135 seconds. Five days later the site was visited by the Minister of Aviation, Roy Jenkins.

In January 1966, it had been transported to Adelaide, Australia, for launches later that year. Also in the UK in 1967 the go-ahead had been given for the UK&#x27;s (separately developed) three-stage Black Arrow rocket launcher (made by Westland Aircraft, with Bristol Siddeley rocket engines developed at the Rocket Propulsion Establishment at Westcott, Buckinghamshire) – Britain did not need to rely on Europa, and Black Arrow would be ready first. Britain then withdrew from ELDO, to concentrate on the Black Arrow, but was committed to supplying ELDO with two Blue Streak rocket stages a year until 1976. At this time in 1969, Britain was spending £30 million a year on space, controlled from the Space Division of the Ministry of Technology. Britain was still dealing with, and funding, ESRO.

By 1970, Hawker Siddeley&#x27;s Blue Streak launcher had cost £100 million to develop. Blue Streak was used for the Europa 2&#x27;s one and only launch on 5 November 1971.

===Second stage===

&quot;Coralie&quot; tests began in December 1965 at Vernon, Eure in France, west of Paris (Société Européenne de Propulsion - SEP, at Vernon, would later develop the Viking main engines for Ariane).

In 1966 and 1967 operations moved to the CIEES test range near Hammaguir, Algeria using the Cora rocket.

===Third stage===
The &quot;Astris&quot; third stage was made in Germany by Entwicklungsring Nord (ERNO Raumfahrttechnik GmbH), based in Bremen, from 1969. The German consortium itself was known as Arbeitsgemeinschaft Satellitenträgersystem (ASAT), which consisted of ERNO and MBB. Although assembled by ERNO in Bremen, the engine was made by Société d&#x27;Etudes pour la Propulsion par Réaction (SEPR), part of Snecma in Villaroche.

On 2 July 1969, on a launch at Woomera of the three-stage rocket, the &quot;Astris&quot; third stage failed to light, after the other two had successfully fired.

After the third stage, an apogee kick motor would be used to put a satellite into a synchronous orbit.

ERNO would later develop the second stage for the Ariane launcher, at the Vereinigte Flugtechnische Werke (VFW) factory in Bremen, later owned by Daimler Benz Aerospace then DaimlerChrysler Aerospace (DASA).

=== Fourth stage (Europa II only) ===

This configuration added a fourth stage derived from the Diamant BP4 P-068 third stage, developing a thrust of 24 kN for 46 seconds.

==Operational history==
The first test took place at 9:14am local time on 5 June 1964 at Woomera. Thrust was terminated after 147 seconds, 6 seconds earlier than planned. The point of impact was from the launch site, instead of the intended . It reached a height of and a maximum speed of . Near space is considered to be around . The craft&#x27;s structure was built by Hawker Siddeley Dynamics and the rocket engine were the Rolls-Royce RZ.2. At this stage the French and German rocket stages were mere fibre-glass scale models.

The first full-size launch, weighing in total 104 tons, took place at Woomera on 24 May 1966, with dummy upper stages. Tests were conducted by Australia&#x27;s Weapons Research Establishment and the French &quot;Laboratoire de Recherche en Balistique et Aérodynamique&quot; (based at Vernon). After two minutes and fifteen seconds, six seconds short of the planned flight, the rocket was destroyed because an impact predictor reported it to be veering west of the planned trajectory. However, the rocket was exactly on course and inaccurate readings had been picked up by a radar station away.

Two-stage testing was planned for June 1967. At 11:12pm GMT on 29 November 1968, the first three-stage Europa 1 launcher failed to put a Italian satellite-model into orbit.

The first launch from French Guiana on 5 November 1971 was also the first launch of the four-stage Europa 2. It exploded over the Atlantic after three minutes. It landed in the sea from the launch site, and had reached a height of .

Overall, the Europa programme had been heavily marred by technical problems. Although the first stage (the British &quot;Blue Streak&quot;) had launched successfully on each occasion, either the second or third stage would fail during every time, preventing a fully successful launch from being achieved. This disappointing performance heavily contributed to work on the programme being terminated.

<text>In astronomy, an analemma (; ) is a diagram showing the position of the Sun in the sky as seen from a fixed location on Earth at the same mean solar time over the course of a year. The change of position is a result of the shifting of the angle in the sky of the path that the Sun takes in respect to the stars (the ecliptic). The diagram resembles a figure eight. Globes of the Earth often display an analemma as a two-dimensional figure of equation of time (&quot;sun fast&quot;) vs. declination of the Sun.

The north–south component of the analemma results from the change in the Sun&#x27;s declination due to the tilt of Earth&#x27;s axis of rotation as it orbits around the Sun. The east–west component results from the nonuniform rate of change of the Sun&#x27;s right ascension, governed by the combined effects of Earth&#x27;s axial tilt and its orbital eccentricity.

One can photograph an analemma by keeping a camera at a fixed location and orientation and taking multiple exposures throughout the year, always at the same time of day (disregarding daylight saving time).

Although the term &quot;analemma&quot; usually refers to Earth&#x27;s solar analemma, it can be applied to other celestial bodies as well.

== Description ==

An analemma can be traced by plotting the position of the Sun as viewed from a fixed position on Earth at the same clock time every day for an entire year, or by plotting a graph of the Sun&#x27;s declination against the equation of time. The resulting curve resembles a long, slender figure-eight with one lobe much larger than the other. This curve is commonly printed on terrestrial globes, usually in the eastern Pacific Ocean, the only large tropical region with very little land. It is possible, though challenging, to photograph the analemma, by leaving the camera in a fixed position for an entire year and snapping images on 24-hour intervals (or some multiple thereof); see section below.

The long axis of the figure—the line segment joining the northernmost point on the analemma to the southernmost—is bisected by the celestial equator, to which it is approximately perpendicular, and has a &quot;length&quot; of twice the obliquity of the ecliptic, i.e., about 47°. The component along this axis of the Sun&#x27;s apparent motion is a result of the familiar seasonal variation of the declination of the Sun through the year. The &quot;width&quot; of the figure is due to the equation of time, and its angular extent is the difference between the greatest positive and negative deviations of local solar time from local mean time when this time-difference is related to angle at the rate of 15° per hour, i.e., 360° in 24 h. This width of the analemma is approximately 7.7°, so the length of the figure is more than six times its width. The difference in size of the lobes of the figure-eight form arises mainly from the fact that the perihelion and aphelion occur far from the equinoxes. Instead, they occur a couple of weeks after the solstices, which in turn causes a slight tilt of the figure eight and its minor lateral asymmetry.

There are three parameters that affect the size and shape of the analemma—obliquity, eccentricity, and the angle between the northward equinox and the periapsis. Viewed from an object with a perfectly circular orbit and no axial tilt, the Sun would always appear at the same point in the sky at the same time of day throughout the year and the analemma would be a dot. For an object with a circular orbit but significant axial tilt, the analemma would be a figure of eight with northern and southern lobes equal in size. For an object with an eccentric orbit but no axial tilt, the analemma would be a straight east–west line along the celestial equator.

The north–south component of the analemma shows the Sun&#x27;s declination, its latitude on the celestial sphere, or the latitude on the Earth at which the Sun is directly overhead. The east–west component shows the equation of time, or the difference between solar time and local mean time. This can be interpreted as how much &quot;ahead&quot; or &quot;behind&quot; the Sun (or an analemmatic sundial) is compared to clock time. It also shows how far west or east the Sun is, compared with its mean position. The analemma can be considered as a graph in which the Sun&#x27;s declination and the equation of time are plotted against each other. In many diagrams of the analemma, a third dimension, that of time, is also included, shown by marks that represent the position of the Sun at various, fairly closely spaced, dates throughout the year.

In diagrams, the analemma is drawn as it would be seen in the sky by an observer looking upward. If north is at the top, &quot;west&quot; is to the &quot;right&quot;. This corresponds with the sign of the equation of time, which is positive in the westward direction. The further west the Sun is, compared with its mean position, the more &quot;fast&quot; a sundial is, compared with a clock. (See Equation of time#Sign of the equation of time.) If the analemma is a graph with positive declination (north) plotted upward, positive equation of time (west) is plotted to the right. This is the conventional orientation for graphs. When the analemma is marked on a geographical globe, west in the analemma is to the right, while the geographical features on the globe are shown with west to the left. To avoid this confusion, it has been suggested that analemmas on globes should be printed with west to the left, but this is not done, at least, not frequently. In practice, the analemma is so nearly symmetrical that the shapes of the mirror images are not easily distinguished, but if date markings are present, they go in opposite directions. The Sun moves eastward on the analemma near the solstices. This can be used to tell which way the analemma is printed. See the image above, at high magnification.

An analemma that includes an image of a solar eclipse has been called a tutulemma, a term coined by photographers Cenk E. Tezel and Tunç Tezel based on the Turkish word for eclipse.

==History==
The book &quot;Analemma&quot; (Greek: Περὶ ἀναλήμματος) by Ptolemy deals with the means for plotting the celestial coordinates of the Sun or any other heavenly body for any geographical latitude at any time. The construction of sundials depends on such calculations.

&quot;Analemma&quot; was a common name for orthographic projection until François d&#x27;Aguilon of Antwerp promoted its present name in 1613.

in 1644, mathematician Jean-Louis Vaulezard described the first analemmatic sundial installed in France (and probably in the world). The sundial is located at the church of Brou, and depicts the 8-shape analemma.
Analemmas (in the modern sense of the term) have been used in conjunction with sundials since the 18th century to convert between apparent and mean solar time. Before this, the term had a more generic meaning that referred to a graphical procedure of representing three-dimensional objects in two dimensions, now known as orthographic projection.

Analemmas were often depicted on early globes. One such example is the terrestrial globe by George Woodward, made in 1846. In 1812, John Lathrop wrote: 
==As seen from Earth==
Owing to the tilt of Earth&#x27;s axis (23.439°) and the Earth&#x27;s orbital eccentricity, the relative location of the Sun above the horizon is not constant from day to day when observed at the same clock time each day. If the time of observation is not 12:00 noon local mean time, then depending on one&#x27;s geographical latitude, this loop will be inclined at different angles.

The figure in this section is an example of an analemma as seen from the Earth&#x27;s northern hemisphere. It is a plot of the position of the Sun at 12:00 noon at Royal Observatory, Greenwich, England (latitude 51.48°N, longitude 0.0015°W) during the year 2006. The horizontal axis is the azimuth angle in degrees (180° is facing south). The vertical axis is the altitude in degrees above the horizon. The first day of each month is shown in black, and the solstices and equinoxes are shown in green. It can be seen that the equinoxes occur approximately at altitude , and the solstices occur approximately at altitudes where &quot;ε &quot; is the axial tilt of the Earth, 23.4°. The analemma is plotted with its width highly exaggerated, revealing a slight asymmetry (due to the two-week misalignment between the apsides of the Earth&#x27;s orbit and its solstices).

The analemma is oriented with the smaller loop appearing north of the larger loop. At the North Pole, the analemma would be completely upright (an 8 with the small loop at the top), and only the top half of it would be visible. Heading south, once south of the Arctic Circle, the entire analemma would become visible. If seen at noon, it continues to be upright, and rises higher from the horizon as the viewer moves south. At the equator it is directly overhead. Further south it moves toward the northern horizon, and is then seen with the larger loop at the top. If viewed at the analemma in the early morning or evening, it would start to tilt to one side as the viewer moves southward from the North Pole. At the equator the analemma would be completely horizontal. As the viewer continued south it would rotate so that the small loop was beneath the large loop in the sky. Crossing the Antarctic Circle the analemma, now nearly completely inverted, would start to disappear, until only 50%, part of the larger loop, was visible from the South Pole.

See equation of time for a more detailed description of the east–west characteristics of the analemma.

==Photography==
The first successful analemma photograph ever made was created in 1978–79 by photographer Dennis di Cicco over Watertown, Massachusetts. Without moving his camera, he made 44 exposures on a single frame of film, all taken at the same time of day at least a week apart. A foreground image and three long-exposure images were also included in the same frame, bringing the total number of exposures to 48.

==Calculated analemmas==
While photographing analemmas may present technical and practical challenges, they can be calculated conveniently and presented in 3D plots for any given location on the surface of the Earth.

The idea is based on the unit vector with its origin fixed at a chosen point on the surface of the Earth and its direction pointing to the center of the Sun all the time. If we calculate the position of the Sun, namely, the solar zenith angle and solar azimuth angle at say, one-hour step, for an entire year, the head of the unit vector traces out 24 analemmas on the unit sphere centered on the chosen point, and this unit sphere is equivalent to the celestial sphere. The figure on the right is the &quot;wreath of analemmas&quot; calculated for the geographic center of the contiguous United States.

As often seen on a globe, the analemma is also often plotted as a two-dimensional figure of equation of time vs. declination of the Sun. The adjacent figure (&quot;Analemma: Equation of time...&quot;) is calculated using the algorithm presented in the reference that uses the formulas given in &quot;The Astronomical Almanac for the Year 2019&quot;.

==Estimating sunrise and sunset data==
If marked to show the position of the Sun on it at fairly regular intervals (such as the 1st, 11th, and 21st days of every calendar month) the analemma summarises the apparent motion of the Sun, relative to its mean position, throughout the year. A date-marked diagram of the analemma, with equal scales in both north–south and east–west directions, can be used as a tool to estimate quantities such as the times of sunrise and sunset, which depend on the Sun&#x27;s position. Generally, making these estimates depends on visualizing the analemma as a rigid structure in the sky, which moves around the Earth at constant speed so it rises and sets once a day, with the Sun slowly moving around it once a year.

Some approximations are involved in the process, chiefly the use of a plane diagram to represent positions on the celestial sphere, and the use of drawing and measurement instead of numerical calculation. Because of these, the estimates are not perfectly precise, but they are usually good enough for practical purposes. Also, they have instructional value, showing in a simple visual way how the times of sunrises and sunsets vary.

===Earliest and latest sunrise and sunset===
The analemma can be used to find the dates of the earliest and latest sunrises and sunsets of the year. These do not occur on the dates of the solstices.

With reference to the image of a simulated analemma in the eastern sky, the lowest point of the analemma has just risen above the horizon. If the Sun were at that point, sunrise would have just occurred. This would be the latest sunrise of the year, since all other points on the analemma would rise earlier. Therefore, the date of the latest sunrise is when the Sun is at this lowest point (29 December, when the analemma is tilted as seen from latitude 50° north, as is shown in the diagram); however, in some areas that use daylight saving time, the date of the latest sunrise occurs on the day before daylight saving time ends. Similarly, when the Sun is at the highest point on the analemma, near its top-left end, (on 15 June) the earliest sunrise of the year will occur. Likewise, at sunset, the earliest sunset will occur when the Sun is at its lowest point on the analemma when it is close to the western horizon, and the latest sunset when it is at the highest point.

None of these points is exactly at one of the ends of the analemma, where the Sun is at a solstice. As seen from northern middle latitudes, as the diagram shows, the earliest sunset occurs some time before the December solstice – typically a week or two before it – and the latest sunrise happens a week or two after the solstice. Thus, the darkest evening occurs in early to mid-December, but the mornings keep getting darker until about the New Year.

The exact dates are those on which the Sun is at the points where the horizon is tangential to the analemma, which in turn depend on how much the analemma, or the north–south meridian passing through it, is tilted from the vertical. This angle of tilt is essentially the co-latitude (90° minus the latitude) of the observer. Calculating these dates numerically is complex, but they can be estimated fairly accurately by placing a straight-edge, tilted at the appropriate angle, tangential to a diagram of the analemma, and reading the dates (interpolating as necessary) when the Sun is at the positions of contact.

In middle latitudes, the dates get further from the solstices as the absolute value of the latitude decreases. In near-equatorial latitudes, the situation is more complex. The analemma lies almost horizontal, so the horizon can be tangential to it at two points, one in each loop of the analemma. Thus there are two widely separated dates in the year when the Sun rises earlier than on adjoining dates, and so on.

===Times of sunrise and sunset===
A similar geometrical method, based on the analemma, can be used to find the times of sunrise and sunset at any place on Earth (except within or near the Arctic Circle or Antarctic Circle), on any date.

The origin of the analemma, where the solar declination and the equation of time are both zero, rises and sets at 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. local mean time on every day of the year, irrespective of the observer&#x27;s latitude. (This estimation does not take account of atmospheric refraction.) If the analemma is drawn in a diagram, tilted at the appropriate angle for an observer&#x27;s latitude (as described above), and if a horizontal line is drawn to pass through the position of the Sun on the analemma on any given date (interpolating between the date markings as necessary), then at sunrise this line represents the horizon.

The origin appears to move along the celestial equator at a speed of 15° per hour, the speed of the Earth&#x27;s rotation. The distance along the celestial equator from the point where it intersects the horizon to the position of the origin of the analemma at sunrise is the distance the origin moves between 6 a.m. and the time of sunrise on the given date. Measuring the length of this equatorial segment therefore gives the difference between 6 a.m. and the time of sunrise.

The measurement should, of course, be done on the diagram, but it should be expressed in terms of the angle that would be subtended at an observer on the ground by the corresponding distance in the analemma in the sky. It can be useful to compare it with the length of the analemma, which subtends 47°. Thus, for example, if the length of the equatorial segment on the diagram is 0.4 times the length of the analemma on the diagram, then the segment in the celestial analemma would subtend 0.4 × 47° = 18.8° at the observer on the ground. The angle, in degrees, should be divided by 15 to get the time difference in hours between sunrise and 6 a.m. The sign of the difference is clear from the diagram. If the horizon line at sunrise passes above the origin of the analemma, the Sun rises before 6 a.m., and &quot;vice versa&quot;.

The same technique can be used, &quot;mutatis mutandis&quot;, to estimate the time of sunset. The estimated times are in local mean time. Corrections must be applied to convert them to standard time or daylight saving time. These corrections will include a term that involves the observer&#x27;s longitude, so both the latitude and longitude affect the final result.

===Azimuths of sunrise and sunset===
The azimuths (true compass bearings) of the points on the horizon where the Sun rises and sets can be easily estimated, using the same diagram as is used to find the times of sunrise and sunset, as described above.

The point where the horizon intersects the celestial equator represents due east or west. The point where the Sun is at sunrise or sunset represents the direction of sunrise or sunset. Simply measuring the distance along the horizon between these points, in angular terms (comparing it with the length of the analemma, as described above), gives the angle between due east or west and the direction of sunrise or sunset. Whether the sunrise or sunset is north or south of due east or west is clear from the diagram. The larger loop of the analemma is at its southern end.

==Seen from other planets==
On Earth, the analemma appears as a , but on other Solar System bodies, it may be very different due to the interplay between the body&#x27;s axial tilt, the non-circularity of its orbit (as characterized by its orbital eccentricity), and the angle between the northward equinox and the periapsis. The tilt tends to make the analemma into a figure-eight, since it causes the actual position of the sun to run ahead of the mean solar time twice during the year (and therefore also to run behind solar time twice). The non-circularity of the orbit tends to make the analemma a figure-zero, with the position of the sun running ahead of mean solar time once during the year due to Kepler&#x27;s second law of planetary motion. In the case of Mars, the sum of the two effects gives a teardrop-shaped analemma. Jupiter, which has a tilt of only 3°, has an analemma that is approximately an ellipse.

In the following list, &quot;day&quot; and &quot;year&quot; refer to the synodic day and sidereal year of the particular body:

; Mercury: Because orbital resonance makes the day exactly two years long, the method of plotting the Sun&#x27;s position at the same time each day would yield only a single point. However, the equation of time can still be calculated for any time of the year, so an analemma can be graphed with this information. The resulting curve is a nearly straight east–west line.
; Venus: There are slightly less than two days per year, so it would take several years to accumulate a complete analemma by the usual method. The resulting curve is an ellipse.
; Mars: Teardrop.
; Jupiter: Ellipse.
; Saturn: Technically a figure-eight, but the northern loop is so small that it more closely resembles a teardrop.
; Uranus: Figure-eight. (Uranus is tilted past sideways to an angle of 98°. Its orbit is about as eccentric as Jupiter&#x27;s and more eccentric than Earth&#x27;s.)
; Neptune: Figure-eight.
==Of geosynchronous satellites==

Geosynchronous satellites revolve around the Earth with a period of one sidereal day. Seen from a fixed point on the Earth&#x27;s surface, they trace paths in the sky which repeat every day, and are therefore simple and meaningful analemmas. They are generally roughly elliptical, teardrop shaped, or figure-8 in shape. Their shapes and dimensions depend on the parameters of the orbits. A subset of geosynchronous satellites are geostationary ones, which ideally have perfectly circular orbits, exactly in the Earth&#x27;s equatorial plane. A geostationary satellite therefore ideally remains stationary relative to the Earth&#x27;s surface, staying over a single point on the equator. No real satellite is exactly geostationary, so real ones trace small analemmas in the sky. Since the sizes of the orbits of geosynchronous satellites are similar to the size of the Earth, substantial parallax occurs, depending on the location of the observer on the Earth&#x27;s surface, so observers in different places see different analemmas.

The paraboloidal dishes that are used for radio communication with geosynchronous satellites often have to move so as to follow the satellite&#x27;s daily movement around its analemma. The mechanisms that drive them must therefore be programmed with the parameters of the analemma. Exceptions are dishes that are used with (approximately) geostationary satellites, since these satellites appear to move so little that a fixed dish can function adequately at all times.

==Of quasi-satellites==
A quasi-satellite, such as the one shown in this diagram, moves in a prograde orbit around the Sun, with the same orbital period (which is also called a year) as the planet it accompanies, but with a different (usually greater) orbital eccentricity. It appears, when seen from the planet, to revolve around the planet once a year in the retrograde direction, but at varying speed and probably not in the ecliptic plane. Relative to its mean position, moving at constant speed in the ecliptic, the quasi-satellite traces an analemma in the planet&#x27;s sky, going around it once a year.

<doc id="82381" wikidata="Q109910" url="?curid=82381" title="Electron capture">
<text>Electron capture (K-electron capture, also K-capture, or L-electron capture, L-capture) is a process in which the proton-rich nucleus of an electrically neutral atom absorbs an inner atomic electron, usually from the K or L electron shells. This process thereby changes a nuclear proton to a neutron and simultaneously causes the emission of an electron neutrino.
: or when written as a nuclear reaction equation, &lt;chem&gt;^{0}_{-1}e + ^{1}_{1}p -&gt; ^{1}_{0}n + ^{0}_{0} &lt;/chem&gt;νformula_1

Since this single emitted neutrino carries the entire decay energy, it has this single characteristic energy. Similarly, the momentum of the neutrino emission causes the daughter atom to recoil with a single characteristic momentum.

The resulting daughter nuclide, if it is in an excited state, then transitions to its ground state. Usually, a gamma ray is emitted during this transition, but nuclear de-excitation may also take place by internal conversion.

Following capture of an inner electron from the atom, an outer electron replaces the electron that was captured and one or more characteristic X-ray photons is emitted in this process. Electron capture sometimes also results in the Auger effect, where an electron is ejected from the atom&#x27;s electron shell due to interactions between the atom&#x27;s electrons in the process of seeking a lower energy electron state.

Following electron capture, the atomic number is reduced by one, the neutron number is increased by one, and there is no change in mass number. Simple electron capture by itself results in a neutral atom, since the loss of the electron in the electron shell is balanced by a loss of positive nuclear charge. However, a positive atomic ion may result from further Auger electron emission.

Electron capture is an example of weak interaction, one of the four fundamental forces.

Electron capture is the primary decay mode for isotopes with a relative superabundance of protons in the nucleus, but with insufficient energy difference between the isotope and its prospective daughter (the isobar with one less positive charge) for the nuclide to decay by emitting a positron. Electron capture is always an alternative decay mode for radioactive isotopes that &quot;do&quot; have sufficient energy to decay by positron emission. Electron capture is sometimes included as a type of beta decay, because the basic nuclear process, mediated by the weak force, is the same. In nuclear physics, beta decay is a type of radioactive decay in which a beta ray (fast energetic electron or positron) and a neutrino are emitted from an atomic nucleus. Electron capture is sometimes called inverse beta decay, though this term usually refers to the interaction of an electron antineutrino with a proton.

If the energy difference between the parent atom and the daughter atom is less than 1.022 MeV, positron emission is forbidden as not enough decay energy is available to allow it, and thus electron capture is the sole decay mode. For example, rubidium-83 (37 protons, 46 neutrons) will decay to krypton-83 (36 protons, 47 neutrons) solely by electron capture (the energy difference, or decay energy, is about 0.9 MeV).

==History==
The theory of electron capture was first discussed by Gian-Carlo Wick in a 1934 paper, and then developed by Hideki Yukawa and others. K-electron capture was first observed by Luis Alvarez, in vanadium, , which he reported in 1937. Alvarez went on to study electron capture in gallium () and other nuclides.

==Reaction details==

The electron that is captured is one of the atom&#x27;s own electrons, and not a new, incoming electron, as might be suggested by the way the reactions are written below. A few examples of electron capture are:

Radioactive isotopes that decay by pure electron capture can be inhibited from radioactive decay if they are fully ionized (&quot;stripped&quot; is sometimes used to describe such ions). It is hypothesized that such elements, if formed by the r-process in exploding supernovae, are ejected fully ionized and so do not undergo radioactive decay as long as they do not encounter electrons in outer space. Anomalies in elemental distributions are thought to be partly a result of this effect on electron capture. Inverse decays can also be induced by full ionisation; for instance, decays into by electron capture; however, a fully ionised decays into a bound state of by the process of bound-state β− decay.

Chemical bonds can also affect the rate of electron capture to a small degree (in general, less than 1%) depending on the proximity of electrons to the nucleus. For example, in 7Be, a difference of 0.9% has been observed between half-lives in metallic and insulating environments. This relatively large effect is because beryllium is a small atom that employs valence electrons that are close to the nucleus, and also in orbitals with no orbital angular momentum. Electrons in s orbitals (regardless of shell or primary quantum number), have a probability antinode at the nucleus, and are thus far more subject to electron capture than p or d electrons, which have a probability node at the nucleus.

Around the elements in the middle of the periodic table, isotopes that are lighter than stable isotopes of the same element tend to decay through electron capture, while isotopes heavier than the stable ones decay by electron emission. Electron capture happens most often in the heavier neutron-deficient elements where the mass change is smallest and positron emission is not always possible. When the loss of mass in a nuclear reaction is greater than zero but less than the process cannot occur by positron emission, but occurs spontaneously for electron capture.

==Common examples==
Some common radionuclides that decay solely by electron capture include:

<text>Akron is a borough in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, United States. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 4,169,

== History ==
Akron was incorporated as a borough in 1895. Before this point, a small village called New Berlin sat at the center of the borough. A railroad used to run through Akron and served a railroad station in the town. A trolley also used to run in parts of the borough. The railroad has since been abandoned and is now the Warwick to Ephrata Rail Trail.

==Geography==
Akron is located in northern Lancaster County at (40.156472, -76.204000). It is bordered to the north by the borough of Ephrata. Two main roads pass through the borough: Main Street and 7th Street (Pennsylvania Route 272). Lancaster, the county seat, is to the southwest, and Reading is to the northeast.

The borough is located on a hill. According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all land. Cocalico Creek forms part of the northern border of the borough and loops past the west side of the borough, leading to the Conestoga River, a tributary of the Susquehanna.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 4,046 people, 1,622 households, and 1,138 families residing in the borough. The population density was . There were 1,687 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the borough was 96.42% White, 0.54% Black or African American, 0.22% Native American, 1.38% Asian, 0.79% from other races, and 0.64% from two or more races. 2.22% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

There were 1,622 households, out of which 27.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 60.5% were married couples living together, 7.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 29.8% were non-families. 24.8% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.41 and the average family size was 2.86.

In the borough the population was spread out, with 21.7% under the age of 18, 6.5% from 18 to 24, 28.3% from 25 to 44, 24.2% from 45 to 64, and 19.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 41 years. For every 100 females there were 89.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 89.3 males.

The median income for a household in the borough was $45,407, and the median income for a family was $53,365. Males had a median income of $37,061 versus $24,545 for females. The per capita income for the borough was $19,983. About 3.4% of families and 4.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 4.9% of those under age 18 and 8.1% of those age 65 or over.

==Schools==

===Elementary===
* Akron Elementary in Ephrata Area School District

== Police, government, and fire protection ==
Akron borough is an independent local government unit located in Lancaster County. It is run by an elected borough council and an elected mayor. The current mayor is John McBeth. The borough council is currently run by President Nathan Imhoff. Established in 1893, the Akron Volunteer Fire Company Lancaster County Station 12 has approximately 50 active members and three pieces of current operating fire apparatus: one engine, one rescue engine, and one squad.

== Economy ==
The economy is mostly made up of small businesses. There are very few large businesses because the town is small and mostly residential. The American headquarters of the Mennonite Central Committee, which started the Fair Trade retailer Ten Thousand Villages are located in the town.

== Recreation ==

Loyd H. Roland Memorial Park (also known as Akron Park), is a 70-plus acre park located on Main Street on the east side of Akron. The park has baseball fields, tennis courts, a beach volleyball court, a basketball court, a playground, hiking trails, a pond, picnic pavilions, a gazebo, and an 18-hole disc golf course.

==Culture==
Akron is one of the many Pennsylvania towns to drop or raise a unique item at midnight on New Year&#x27;s Eve. The &quot;Shoe-In&quot; begins several hours before midnight with children&#x27;s activities, carriage rides, music, and a bonfire. People donate children&#x27;s shoes which are passed on to the needy. In honor of the area&#x27;s former shoemaking industry (that used to be located where the Ten-Thousand Villages corporate offices are currently located) a giant sneaker is lowered at midnight.

<text>Heinrich Theodor Böll (; ; 21 December 1917 – 16 July 1985) was a German writer. Considered one of Germany&#x27;s foremost post-World War II writers, Böll received the Georg Büchner Prize (1967) and the Nobel Prize for Literature (1972).

== Biography ==
Böll was born in Cologne, Germany, to a Roman Catholic and pacifist family that later opposed the rise of Nazism. Böll refused to join the Hitler Youth during the 1930s. He was apprenticed to a bookseller before studying German studies and classics at the University of Cologne.

Conscripted into the Wehrmacht, he served in Poland, France, Romania, Hungary and the Soviet Union. In 1942, Böll married Annemarie Cech, with whom he had three sons; she later collaborated with him on a number of different translations into German of English-language literature. During his war service, Böll was wounded four times and contracted typhoid. He was captured by US Army soldiers in April 1945 and sent to a prisoner-of-war camp.

After the war, he returned to Cologne and began working in his family&#x27;s cabinet shop and, for one year, worked in a municipal statistical bureau, a job he did not enjoy and which he left in order to take the risk of becoming a writer instead.

Böll became a full-time writer at the age of 30. His first novel, &quot;Der Zug war pünktlich&quot; (&quot;The Train Was on Time&quot;), was published in 1949. He was invited to the 1949 meeting of the Group 47 circle of German authors and his work was deemed to be the best presented in 1951. Many other novels, short stories, radio plays, and essay collections followed.

==Awards, honours and appointments==
Böll was extremely successful and was lauded on a number of occasions. In 1953 he was awarded the Culture Prize of German Industry, the Southern German Radio Prize and the German Critics&#x27; Prize. In 1954 he received the prize of the Tribune de Paris. In 1955 he was given the French prize for the best foreign novel. In 1958 he won the Eduard von der Heydt prize of the city of Wuppertal and the prize of the Bayerische Akademie der Schönen Künste (Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts). In 1959 he was given the Great Art Prize of the State of North-Rhine-Westphalia and the Literature Prize of the city of Cologne, and was elected to the Academy of Science and the Arts in Mainz.

In 1960 he became a member of the Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts and gained the Charles Veillon Prize.

In 1967 he was given the Georg Büchner Prize.

In 1972 he received the Nobel Prize for Literature &quot;for his writing which through its combination of a broad perspective on his time and a sensitive skill in characterization has contributed to a renewal of German literature&quot;.

He was given a number of honorary awards up to his death, such as the membership of the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1974, and the Ossietzky Medal of 1974 (the latter for his defence of and contribution to global human rights).

Böll was President of PEN International, the worldwide association of writers, from 1971 to 1973.

Böll was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1983 and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1984.

==Works==
His work has been translated into more than 30 languages, and he remains one of Germany&#x27;s most widely read authors. His best-known works are &quot;Billiards at Half-past Nine&quot; (1959), &quot;And Never Said a Word&quot; (1953), &quot;The Bread of Those Early Years&quot; (1955), &quot;The Clown&quot; (1963), &quot;Group Portrait with Lady&quot; (1971), &quot;The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum&quot; (1974), and &quot;The Safety Net&quot; (1979).

Despite his work&#x27;s variety of themes and content, certain patterns recur: much of his work describes intimate and personal life struggling to sustain itself against the wider background of war, terrorism, political divisions, and profound economic and social transition. Many of his books have stubborn and eccentrically individualistic protagonists who oppose the mechanisms of the state or of public institutions.

Böll was a devoted pacifist because of his war experiences. All of his writing and novels during the postwar years had to do with the war and making sure it never happened again. He encapsulated it in the phrase &quot;never war again&quot;.

In his autobiography, Böll wrote that at the high school he attended when growing up under Nazi rule, an anti-Nazi teacher paid special attention to the Roman satirist Juvenal: &quot;Mr. Bauer realized how topical Juvenal was, how he dealt at length with such phenomena as arbitrary government, tyranny, corruption, the degradation of public morals, the decline of the Republican ideal and the terrorizing acts of the Praetorian Guards. [...] In a secondhand bookshop I found an 1838 translation of Juvenal with an extensive commentary, twice the length of the translated text itself, written at the height of the Romantic period. Though its price was more than I could really afford, I bought it. I read all of it very intensely, as if it was a detective novel. It was one of the few books to which I persistently held on throughout the war [WWII] and beyond, even when most of my other books were lost or sold on the black market&quot;.

== Media scandals ==
The 1963 publication of &quot;The Clown&quot; was met with polemics in the press for its negative portrayal of the Catholic Church and the CDU party. Böll was devoted to Catholicism but also deeply critical of aspects of it, especially in its most conservative incarnations. In particular, he was unable to forget the Concordat of July 1933 between the Vatican and the Nazis, signed by the future Pope Pius XII, which helped confer international legitimacy on the regime early in its development.

Böll&#x27;s liberal views on religion and social issues elicited German conservatives&#x27; wrath. When constitutional reforms were passed in 1968 that cracked down on freedom, Böll spoke out against them. His 1972 article &quot;Soviel Liebe auf einmal&quot; (&quot;So much love at once&quot;), which accused the tabloid &quot;Bild&quot; of falsified journalism, was in turn retitled, at the time of publishing and against Böll&#x27;s wishes, by &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, and the new title was used as a pretext to accuse Böll of sympathy with terrorism. This particular criticism was driven in large part by his repeated insistence on the importance of due process and the correct and fair application of the law in the case of the Baader-Meinhof Group. In his article for Der Spiegel titled &quot;Sixty Million against Six&quot;, he asked for a safeguard for Ulrike Meinhof in order to open a dialogue and prevent a major press campaign and police campaign. Böll was heavily criticized for this and dubbed &quot;the spiritual father of the violence&quot; by one journalist in the &quot;Springer press&quot;.

The conservative press even attacked Böll&#x27;s 1972 Nobel Prize, arguing that it was awarded only to &quot;liberals and left-wing radicals&quot;.

On 7 February 1974, the &quot;BZ&quot;, Berlin&#x27;s most widely read newspaper at the time, reported that Böll&#x27;s home had been searched. In fact, his home was searched only later that day, after the newspaper had already been circulated.

In 1977, after the abduction of Hanns Martin Schleyer, 40 police searched Böll&#x27;s house based on an anonymous tip they received that named Böll&#x27;s son as an accomplice to the kidnappers. This claim turned out to be unfounded. The Christian Democrats placed Böll on a blacklist after this incident.

==Influences==
Böll was deeply rooted in his hometown of Cologne, with its strong Roman Catholicism and rather rough and drastic sense of humour. In the immediate postwar period, he was preoccupied with memories of the war and its effect—materially and psychologically—on ordinary people&#x27;s lives. They are the heroes of his writing. His Catholicism was important to his work in ways that can be compared to writers such as Graham Greene and Georges Bernanos, though, as noted earlier, his perspective on Catholicism was critical and challenging, not passive.

Böll was deeply affected by the Nazi takeover of Cologne, as the Nazis essentially exiled him in his own town. Additionally, Cologne&#x27;s destruction in the Allied bombing during World War II scarred him for life; he described the bombing&#x27;s aftermath in &quot;The Silent Angel&quot;. Architecturally, the rebuilt Cologne, prosperous once more, left him indifferent. (Böll seems to have been an admirer of William Morris; he let it be known that he would have preferred that Cologne Cathedral be left unfinished, with the 14th-century wooden crane at the top, as it had stood in 1848). Throughout his life, he remained in close contact with Cologne&#x27;s citizens, rich and poor. When he was in hospital, the nurses often complained about the &quot;low-life&quot; people who came to see their friend Böll.

Böll had a great fondness for Ireland, holidaying with his wife at their second home there, on the west coast. Given this connection, it is tempting to see resonances between Böll&#x27;s work—especially his surreal play &quot;A Mouthful of Earth&quot;—and that of his contemporary Samuel Beckett. Böll&#x27;s concern about damage to the environment, so evident in his play, was a driving force behind the establishment of the Heinrich Böll Foundation.

Böll&#x27;s villains are the figures of authority in government, business, the mainstream media, and the Church, whom he castigates, sometimes humorously, sometimes acidly, for what he saw as their conformism, lack of courage, self-satisfied attitude, and abuse of power.

Newspapers in his books have no qualms about lying about the characters or destroying their lives, evoking Böll&#x27;s experience of being accused of harboring and defending anarchists.

==Analysis==
Böll&#x27;s work has been dubbed &quot;Trümmerliteratur&quot; (the literature of the rubble). He was a leader of the German writers who tried to come to grips with the memory of World War II, the Nazis, the Holocaust, and the guilt that came with them. Because of his refusal to avoid writing about the complexities and problems of the past, some called him the &quot;Gewissen der Nation&quot; (&quot;conscience of the nation&quot;), a catalyst and conduit for memorialization and discussion in opposition to the tendency toward silence and taboo. This was a label Böll was keen to jettison, because he felt that it occluded a fair audit of the institutions truly responsible for what had happened.

Böll lived with his wife in Cologne and in the Eifel region. He also spent time on Achill Island, off Ireland&#x27;s west coast. His cottage there is now used as a guesthouse for international and Irish artists. He recorded some of his experiences in Ireland in his book &quot;Irish Journal&quot;; later, the people of Achill curated a festival in his honour. The Irish connection also influenced the translations into German by his wife Annemarie, which included works by Brendan Behan, J. M. Synge, G. B. Shaw, Flann O&#x27;Brien, and Tomás Ó Criomhthain.

Böll was president of the then West German P.E.N. and subsequently of the International P.E.N. organizations. He often traveled as a representative of the new, democratic Germany. His appearance and attitude completely contrasted with the boastful, aggressive type of German who had become infamous during Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rule. Böll was particularly successful in Eastern Europe, as he seemed to portray the dark side of capitalism in his books, which sold by the millions in the Soviet Union alone.

When Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn was expelled from the Soviet Union, he first took refuge in Böll&#x27;s Eifel cottage. This was in part the result of Böll&#x27;s visit to the Soviet Union in 1962 with a cultural delegation, the first of several trips he made there, during which he made friendships with writers and connections with producers of dissident literature. With Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s meeting, Böll responded to the criticism from both sides that branded him an instrument of anti-socialist propaganda or a stooge for the East Germans with the following statement: &quot;perhaps many Germans do not read &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot; to experience the suffering of those to whom this monument is dedicated, but rather to forget the horror of their own history.&quot; As president of the West German P.E.N., Böll had recommended Solzhenitsyn for the Nobel Prize for Literature. When Solzhenitsyn received the prize in 1970, he quoted Böll&#x27;s works to the reception committee.

In 1976, Böll publicly left the Catholic Church, &quot;without falling away from the faith&quot;. He died in 1985 at the age of 67.

==Legacy and influence==
Böll&#x27;s memory lives on, among other places, at the Heinrich Böll Foundation. The Cologne Library set up the Heinrich Böll Archive to house his personal papers, bought from his family, but much of the material was damaged, possibly irreparably, when the building collapsed in 2009.

His cottage in Ireland has been used as a residency for writers since 1992.

Eric Anderson wrote a set of musical compositions based on Böll&#x27;s books: &quot;Silent Angel: Fire and Ashes of Heinrich Böll&quot; (2017, Meyer Records).

<text>Gender-affirming surgery (GAS) is a surgical procedure, or series of procedures, that alters a person&#x27;s physical appearance and sexual characteristics to resemble those associated with their identified gender. The phrase is most often associated with transgender health care and intersex medical interventions, though many such treatments are also pursued by cisgender and non-intersex persons. It is also known as sex reassignment surgery (SRS), gender confirmation surgery (GCS), and several other names. 

Professional medical organizations have established Standards of Care, which apply before someone can apply for and receive reassignment surgery, including psychological evaluation, and a period of real-life experience living in the desired gender.

Feminization surgeries are surgeries that result in female-looking anatomy, such as vaginoplasty, vulvoplasty and breast augmentation. Masculinization surgeries are those that result in male-looking anatomy, such as phalloplasty and breast reduction.

In addition to gender-affirming surgery, patients may need to follow a lifelong course of masculinizing or feminizing hormone replacement therapy to support the endocrine system.

Sweden became the first country in the world to allow transgender people to change their legal gender after &quot;reassignment surgery&quot; and provide free hormone treatment, in 1972. Singapore followed soon after in 1973, being the first in Asia.

== Terminology ==
Gender-affirming surgery is known by many other names, including &quot;gender-affirmation surgery&quot;, &quot;sex reassignment surgery&quot;, &quot;gender reassignment surgery&quot;, and &quot;gender confirmation surgery&quot;. It is also sometimes called a &quot;sex change&quot;, though this term is usually considered offensive. &quot;Top surgery&quot; and &quot;bottom surgery&quot; refer to surgeries on the chest and genitals respectively.

Some transgender people who want medical assistance to transition from one sex to another identify as &quot;transsexual&quot;.

Trans women and others assigned male at birth may undergo one or more feminizing procedures: genital surgeries such as penectomy (removal of the penis), orchiectomy (removal of the testes), vaginoplasty (construction of a vagina), vulvoplasty (construction of a vulva); as well as breast augmentation, tracheal shave (reduction of the Adam&#x27;s apple), facial feminization surgery, and voice feminization surgery among others.

Trans men and others assigned female at birth may undergo one or more masculinizing procedures; such as chest reconstruction, breast reduction, hysterectomy (removal of the uterus), oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries). A penis can be constructed through metoidioplasty or phalloplasty, and a scrotum through scrotoplasty.

As knowledge of non-binary genders expands in the medical community, more surgeons are willing to tailor operations to individual needs. Bigenital operations allow individuals to construct a penis or vagina and retain their original organs. Gender nullification is the removal of all external genitalia except the urethral opening, typically pursued by people assigned male at birth. 

&quot;Gender-affirming surgery&quot; can also refer to operations pursued by cisgender people, such as mammaplasty, penile implant, or testicular implants following orchiectomy.

Gender-affirming surgery is often sensationalized and misrepresented by anti-trans activists through terms such as &quot;genital-mutilation surgery&quot;.

== Surgical procedures ==
The best-known gender-affirming procedures are those that reshape the genitals, which are also known as &quot;genital reassignment surgery&quot;, &quot;genital reconstruction surgery&quot;, &quot;sex reassignment surgery,&quot; and &quot;bottom surgery&quot; (the latter is named in contrast to &quot;top surgery&quot;, which is surgery to the breasts). However, the meaning of &quot;sex reassignment surgery&quot; has been clarified by the medical organization, the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), to include any of a larger number of surgical procedures performed as part of a medical treatment for gender dysphoria.

WPATH says medically necessary gender-affirming surgeries include &quot;complete hysterectomy, bilateral mastectomy, chest reconstruction or augmentation ... including breast prostheses if necessary, genital reconstruction (by various techniques which must be appropriate to each patient ...)... and certain facial plastic reconstruction.&quot; Other non-surgical procedures are also considered medically necessary treatments by WPATH, including facial hair electrolysis.

=== Genital surgery ===
==== Feminizing====

For trans women and transfeminine people, genital reconstruction usually involves surgical construction of a vagina. The most common techniques are penile inversion, rectosigmoid vaginoplasty and peritoneal pullthrough vaginoplasty (PPT). Another technique, the non-penile inversion technique, uses perforated scrotal tissue to construct the vaginal canal. A less invasive procedure with reduced postoperative care requirements is vulvoplasty, which creates external female genitalia without a vaginal canal. The downside of this procedure is that it does not allow for penetrative sex. 

====Masculinizing====

For trans men and transmasculine people, genital reconstruction may involve the construction of a penis through either phalloplasty or metoidioplasty, which is less invasive but results in a smaller penis. 

====Non-binary people====
Non-binary people may elect to get any of the surgeries listed above, depending on their sex assignment. They may also opt for bigenital or gender nullification surgeries. Bigenital operations include androgynoplasty, a procedure that retains the penis, or vagina-preserving phalloplasty. These procedures tend to be rarely performed. In 2017, one of the leading UK trans surgeons, James Bellringer, commented that he had never received a request for it.

====Other considerations====
Genital surgery may also involve other medically necessary procedures, such as orchiectomy, penectomy, or vaginectomy. Complications of penile inversion vaginoplasty are mostly minor; however, rectoneovaginal fistula (abnormal connection between the neovagina and the rectum) can occur in about 1–3% of patients. These require further surgery to correct.

=== Other surgeries ===
As underscored by WPATH, gender transition may entail a variety of non-genital surgeries that change primary or secondary sex characteristics, any of which are considered &quot;gender-affirming surgery&quot; when done to affirm a person&#x27;s gender identity. For trans men, these may include mastectomy (removal of the breasts) and chest reconstruction (the shaping of a male-contoured chest), or hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of ovaries and fallopian tubes). For some trans women, facial feminization surgery, hair transplants, and breast augmentation are also aesthetic components of their surgical treatment. Voice feminizing surgery is a procedure in which the overall pitch range of the patient&#x27;s voice is reduced. Adam&#x27;s apple reduction surgery (chondrolaryngoplasty) or tracheal shaving is a procedure in which the most prominent part of the thyroid cartilage is reduced.

There is also Adam&#x27;s apple enhancement therapy, in which cartilage is used to bring out the Adam&#x27;s apple in female-to-male patients.

== History ==
Reports of people seeking gender-confirming surgery (vaginoplasty) go back to the 2nd century, such as Roman Emperor Elagabalus.

=== 20th century ===
In the US in 1917, Alan L. Hart, an American tuberculosis specialist, became one of the first trans men to undergo hysterectomy and gonadectomy as treatment of what is now called gender dysphoria.

Dora Richter is the first known trans woman to undergo complete male-to-female genital surgery. She was one of several transgender people in the care of sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld at Berlin&#x27;s Institute for Sexual Research. In 1922, Richter underwent orchiectomy. In early 1931, a penectomy, followed in June by vaginoplasty. 

In 1930-1931, Lili Elbe underwent four sex reassignment surgeries, including orchiectomy, an ovarian transplant, and penectomy. In June 1931, she underwent her fourth surgery, including an experimental uterine transplant and vaginoplasty, which she hoped would allow her to give birth. However, her body rejected the transplanted uterus, and she died of post-operative complications in September, at age 48.

A previous sex reassignment surgery patient was Magnus Hirschfeld&#x27;s housekeeper, but their name has not been discovered.

Elmer Belt may have been the first U.S. surgeon to perform gender affirmation surgery, in about 1950.

In 1951, Harold Gillies, a plastic surgeon active in World War II, worked to develop the first technique for female-to-male gender-affirming surgery, producing a technique that has become a modern standard, called phalloplasty. Phalloplasty is a cosmetic procedure that produces a visual penis out of grafted tissue from the patient.

In 1971, Roberto Farina performed Brazil&#x27;s first male-to-female gender-affirming surgery.

In 1984, Jalma Jurado developed a new surgical technique, which he used in surgeries for more than 500 trans women in Brazil and from around the world.

Following phalloplasty, in 1999, the procedure for metoidioplasty was developed for female-to-male surgical transition by the doctors Lebovic and Laub. Considered a variant of phalloplasty, metoidioplasty works to create a penis out of the patient&#x27;s present clitoris. This allows the patient to have a sensation-perceiving penis head. Metoidioplasty may be used in conjunction with phalloplasty to produce a larger, more &quot;cis-appearing&quot; penis in multiple stages.

=== 21st century ===
On 12 June 2003, the European Court of Human Rights ruled in favor of Carola van Kück, a German trans woman whose insurance company denied her reimbursement for sex reassignment surgery as well as hormone replacement therapy. The legal arguments related to the Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights as well as the Article 8. This affair is called &quot;van Kück vs Germany&quot;.

In 2011, Christiane Völling won the first successful case brought by an intersex person against a surgeon for non-consensual surgical intervention described by the International Commission of Jurists as &quot;an example of an individual who was subjected to sex reassignment surgery without full knowledge or consent&quot;.

 some European countries require forced sterilization for the legal recognition of sex reassignment. , Japan also requires an individual to undergo sterilization to change their legal sex.

The early history of gender-affirming surgery in trans people has been reviewed by various authors.

== Prevalence ==
The prevalence of transgender-related surgeries is difficult to measure and likely underestimated. In 2015, the largest survey of transgender people in the United States reported that 25% of respondents reported had undergone such a surgery.

== Prior to surgery ==

=== Medical considerations ===
Some medical conditions, including diabetes, asthma, and HIV, can lead to complications with future therapy and pharmacological management. Typical gender-affirming surgery procedures involve complex medication regimens, including sex-hormone therapy, throughout and after surgery. Typically, a patient&#x27;s treatment involves a healthcare team consisting of a variety of providers including endocrinologists, whom the surgeon may consult when determining if the patient is physically fit for surgery. Health providers including pharmacists can play a role in maintaining safe and cost-effective regimens, providing patient education, and addressing other health issues including smoking cessation and weight loss.

People with HIV or hepatitis C may have difficulty finding a surgeon able to perform successful surgery. Many surgeons operate in small private clinics that cannot treat potential complications in these populations. Some surgeons charge higher fees for HIV and hepatitis C-positive patients; other medical professionals assert that it is unethical to deny surgical or hormonal treatments to transgender people solely on the basis of their HIV or hepatitis status.

Fertility is also a factor considered in gender-affirming surgery, as patients are typically informed that if an orchiectomy or oöphoro-hysterectomy is performed, it will make them irreversibly infertile.

=== Gender dysphoric children ===
Gender-affirming surgery is generally not performed on children under 18, though in rare cases may be performed on adolescents if health care providers agree there is an unusual benefit to doing so or risk to not performing it. Preferred treatments for children include puberty blockers, which are thought to have some reversible physical changes, and sex hormones, which reduce the need for future surgery. Medical protocols typically require long-term mental health counseling to verify persistent and genuine gender dysphoria before any intervention, and consent of a parent or guardian or court order is legally required in most jurisdictions.

=== Intersex children and cases of trauma ===
Infants born with intersex conditions might undergo interventions at or close to birth. This is controversial because of the human rights implications.

There can be negative outcomes (including PTSD and suicide) when the surgically assigned gender does not match the person&#x27;s gender identity, which will be realized by the person only later in life. Milton Diamond at the John A. Burns School of Medicine, University of Hawaii recommended that physicians not perform surgery on children until they are old enough to give informed consent and to assign such infants in the gender to which they will probably best adjust. Diamond believed introducing children to others with differences of sex development could help remove shame and stigma. Diamond considered the intersex condition as a difference of sex development, not as a disorder.

=== Standards of care ===
Gender-affirming surgery can be hard to obtain due to financial barriers, insurance coverage, and lack of providers. A growing number of surgeons are now training to perform such surgeries. In many regions, a person&#x27;s pursuit of gender-affirming surgery is often governed, or at least guided, by documents called Standards of Care for the Health of Transgender and Gender Diverse People (SOC). The most widespread SOC in this field is published and often revised by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH, formerly the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association or HBIGDA). Many jurisdictions and medical boards in the US and other countries recognize the WPATH Standards of Care for the treatment of transgender individuals. Some treatment may require a minimum duration of psychological evaluation and living as a member of the target gender full-time, sometimes called the real life experience (RLE) (sometimes mistakenly called the real life test [RLT]) before sex reassignment surgeries are covered by insurance.

Standards of Care usually give certain very specific &quot;minimum&quot; requirements as guidelines for progressing with treatment, causing them to be highly controversial and often maligned documents among transgender patients seeking surgery. Alternative local standards of care exist, such as in the Netherlands, Germany, and Italy. Much of the criticism surrounding the WPATH/HBIGDA-SOC applies to these as well, and some of these SOCs (mostly European SOC) are actually based on much older versions of the WPATH SOC. Other SOCs are entirely independent of the WPATH. The criteria of many of those SOCs are stricter than the latest revision of the WPATH-SOC. Many qualified surgeons in North America and many in Europe adhere almost unswervingly to the WPATH SOC or other SOCs. However, in the United States many experienced surgeons are able to apply the WPATH SOC in ways which respond to an individual&#x27;s medical circumstances, as is consistent with the SOC.

Many surgeons require two letters of recommendation for gender-affirming surgery. At least one of these letters must be from a mental health professional experienced in diagnosing gender identity disorder (now recognized as gender dysphoria), who has known the patient for over a year. Letters must state that sex reassignment surgery is the correct course of treatment for the patient.

Many medical professionals and many professional associations have stated that surgical interventions should not be required for transsexual individuals to change sex designation on identity documents. However, depending on the legal requirements of many jurisdictions, transsexual and transgender people are often unable to change the listing of their sex in public records unless they can furnish a physician&#x27;s letter attesting that sex reassignment surgery has been performed. In some jurisdictions legal gender change is prohibited in any circumstances, even after genital or other surgery or treatment.

=== Insurance ===

A growing number of public and commercial health insurance plans in the US now contain defined benefits covering sex reassignment-related procedures, usually including genital reconstruction surgery (MTF and FTM), chest reconstruction (FTM), breast augmentation (MTF), and hysterectomy (FTM). For patients to qualify for insurance coverage, certain insurance plans may require proof of the following:
* a written initial assessment by a qualified licensed mental health professional
* persistent, well-documented gender dysphoria
* months of prior physician-supervised hormone therapy

In June 2008, the American Medical Association (AMA) House of Delegates stated that the denial to patients with gender dysphoria or otherwise covered benefits represents discrimination, and that the AMA supports &quot;public and private health insurance coverage for treatment for gender dysphoria as recommended by the patient&#x27;s physician.&quot; Other organizations have issued similar statements, including WPATH, the American Psychological Association, and the National Association of Social Workers.

In 2017, the United States Defense Health Agency for the first time approved payment for sex reassignment surgery for an active-duty U.S. military service member. The patient, an infantry soldier who is a trans woman, had already begun a course of treatment for gender reassignment. The procedure, which the treating doctor deemed medically necessary, was performed on 14 November at a private hospital, since US military hospitals lack the requisite surgical expertise.

== Post-procedural considerations ==

=== Quality of life ===
Clinical research on long-term quality-of-life outcomes following surgery is limited and confounded by various factors, including small sample sizes, and baseline rates of mental health issues and suicide among transgender people compared to the general population.

A 2020 meta-analysis found &quot;evidence of low quality&quot; that gender-affirming surgery, particularly chest reconstruction for trans men, improves quality of life. A 2024 systematic review found that genital surgeries significantly improved depression and dissociation, with &quot;mixed results&quot; for other mental health outcomes.

A secondary analysis of the U.S. Transgender Survey found that gender-affirming surgery was significantly associated with lower rates of psychological distress, smoking, and suicidal ideation, compared to rates among respondents who desired surgery but had not undergone it. This was the largest controlled study on the subject to date (N=19,960), though the design of the survey and self-reported responses introduced some limitations and possible response bias.

Gender-affirming surgery can be seen as human enhancement. A 2021 review found that less than 1% of 7,928 patients regretted gender-affirming surgery. 

=== Psychological and social consequences ===

A 2009 review in the &quot;International Journal of Transgenderism&quot; found that from 1998 onward, studies have shown that &quot;the whole process of gender reassignment is effective in relieving gender dysphoria and that its positive results greatly outweighed any negative consequences&quot;, but noted methodological issues in many studies, particularly older ones. A 2010 meta-analysis in &quot;Clinical Endocrinology&quot; noted the lack of randomization and control groups and reliance of self-reporting in the studies it reviewed, reaching the conclusion &quot;Very low quality evidence suggests that hormonal therapies given to individuals with GID as a part of sex reassignment are likely to improve gender dysphoria, psychological functioning and comorbidities, sexual function and overall quality of life.&quot;

Smith et al. (2001) found that among 20 patients, anxiety, depression and hostility levels were lower after gender-affirming surgery. Wierckx et al. (2011), in a study of 49 trans men, found them in good self-perceived physical and mental health. Dhejne et al. (2011), in a study following 324 trans people who received gender-affirming surgery from 1973 to 2003, found that they &quot;have considerably higher risks for mortality, suicidal behaviour, and psychiatric morbidity than the general population&quot;; concluding, &quot;sex reassignment, although alleviating gender dysphoria, may not suffice as treatment for transsexualism&quot;. Lawrence (2003), in a study of 232 trans women who underwent surgery in 1994-2000, found &quot;None reported outright regret and only a few expressed even occasional regret.&quot;

Risk categories for post-operative regret include being older, having characterized personality disorders with personal and social instability, lacking family support, lacking sexual activity, and expressing dissatisfaction with the results of surgery. During the process of gender-affirming surgery, transgender people may become victims of different social obstacles such as discrimination, prejudice and stigmatizing behaviours. The rejection faced by trans people is much more severe than what is experienced by lesbians, gays, and bisexuals. The hostile environment may trigger or worsen internalized transphobia, depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress.

Many patients perceive the outcome of the surgery as not only medically but also psychologically important. Social support can help them to relate to their minority identity, ascertain their trans identity and reduce minority stress.

=== Sexuality ===
Looking specifically at transsexual people&#x27;s genital sensitivities, both trans men and trans women are capable of maintaining their genital sensitivities after gender-affirming surgery. However, these are counted upon the procedures and surgical tricks which are used to preserve the sensitivity. Considering the importance of genital sensitivity in helping transsexuals to avoid unnecessary harm or injury to the genitals, allowing trans men to obtain erection by inserting a penile implant after phalloplasty, the ability of trans people to experience erogenous and tactile sensitivity in their reconstructed genitals is one of the essential objectives surgeons want to achieve in gender-affirming surgery. Moreover, studies have also found that the critical procedure for genital sensitivity maintenance and achieving orgasm after phalloplasty is to preserve both the clitoral hood and the clitoris underneath the reconstructed phallus.

Erogenous sensitivity is measured by the abilities to reach orgasm in genital sexual activities, like masturbation and intercourse. Many studies reviewed that both trans men and trans women have reported an increase of orgasms in both sexual activities, implying the possibilities to maintain or even enhance genital sensitivity after gender-affirming surgery.

Most trans persons report enjoying better sex lives and improved sexual satisfaction after gender-affirming surgery. The enhancement of sexual satisfaction was positively related to the satisfaction of new primary sex characteristics. Before gender-affirming surgery, trans patients had unwanted sex organs which they were eager to remove. Hence, they were not enthusiastic about engaging in sexual activity. Transsexual individuals who have undergone gender-affirming surgery are more satisfied with their bodies and experienced less stress when participating in sexual activity.

Most of the individuals report that they have experienced sexual excitement during sexual activity, including masturbation. The ability to obtain orgasm is positively associated with sexual satisfaction. Frequency and intensity of orgasm are substantially different for trans men and trans women. Almost all female-to-male individuals revealed an increase in sexual excitement and can achieve orgasm through sexual activity with a partner or via masturbation, whereas only 85% of the male-to-female individuals are able to achieve orgasm after gender-affirming surgery. A study found that both trans men and trans women reported qualitative change in their experience of orgasm. The female-to-male trans individuals reported that they had been experiencing intensified and stronger excitements and orgasm while male-to-female persons have been encountering longer and more gentle feelings.

Rates of masturbation have also changed after gender-affirming surgery for both trans women and trans men. A study reported an overall increase of masturbation frequencies in most transsexuals and 78% of them were able to reach orgasm by masturbation after gender-affirming surgery. A study showed that there were differences in masturbation frequency between trans men and trans women; female-to-male individuals masturbated more often than male-to-female. The possible reasons for the difference in masturbation frequency could be associated with the surge of libido, which was caused by the testosterone therapies, or the withdrawal of gender dysphoria.

Concerning trans people&#x27;s expectations for different aspects of their life, the sexual aspects have the lowest level of satisfaction among all other elements (physical, emotional and social levels). When comparing trans with cisgender persons of the same gender, trans women had a similar sexual satisfaction to cis women, but trans men had a lower level of sexual satisfaction to cis men. Moreover, trans men also had a lower sexual satisfaction with their sexual life than trans women.

<text>Elizabethtown (Pennsylvania Dutch: &quot;Betzischteddel&quot;) is a borough in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is located southeast of Harrisburg, the state capital. Small factories existed at the turn of the 20th century when the population in 1900 was 1,861. As of the 2020 census, the population of the borough was 11,639. Elizabethtown is commonly referred to in south-central Pennsylvania as E-Town. This nickname is also used for the local college and high school.

== History ==
There are two stories about the origin of the town&#x27;s name. In one version it is named after Elizabeth Reeby, wife of Michael Reeby who sold the first building lots here in about 1795. The officially accepted history is that, in 1753, Captain Barnabas Hughes acquired land and laid out a town, naming it for his wife, Elizabeth. The early settlers were primarily Scots-Irish and Pennsylvania Dutch. In 1758 General John Forbes supplied the expedition to Fort Duquesne with flour and oats and stationed a regiment here to protect his supplies.

Elizabethtown became a borough in 1827, and a railroad was built through the area in the 1830s. The town was primarily agricultural until the early 1900s, when the Klein Chocolate Company (now part of Mars, Inc.) and several shoe factories, the last of which closed in 1979, opened. Elizabethtown College was established in 1899, and the Masonic Homes, now the Masonic Village,) followed in 1910.

Following the end of World War II, Elizabethtown grew rapidly, more than doubling its population between 1950 and 2000. Homes and businesses expanded into nearby farmland, making sprawl, farmland preservation, and revitalizing the downtown area important issues.

The theater reopened November 12, 1993.
*Mountain Springs Hotel, the site of the former hotel stands at the corner of Main Street (U.S. Route 322) and Spring Garden Street. Unoccupied for a long period of time, it was torn down in 2004, except for a small portion of the original building, which was preserved and renovated to be used as a conference center and, possibly, as a museum.
*Ephrata Performing Arts Center, the Ephrata Performing Arts Center (EPAC) started as the Legion Star Playhouse in 1953 under the direction of John Cameron. In 1972, following Cameron&#x27;s departure, volunteers took over the production of regular shows and eventually incorporated as a non-profit in 1979; the first season under the name of EPAC came in 1980. Following a $2.4 million renovation, the community theater was able to and still produces year-round theater, including plays, musicals, a children&#x27;s series, regular educational opportunities, including a summer theater camp, and special performances.

===Area attractions===
*Ephrata Fair, the largest street fair in Pennsylvania. The fair dates back to October 1919, when local businessmen organized a one-day festivity to commemorate World War I veterans. Over the following years, the fair grew to include farmers celebrating the harvest; and it also grew in duration by several days. The popular parade was added in 1932. The fair is presently held for five days each September and attracts tens of thousands of visitors.

== Sister city ==
Ephrata has one sister city, as designated by Sister Cities International: 
* Eberbach, Baden-Württemberg, Germany

==Tornado==
On March 29, 2009, a strong storm briefly swept through Ephrata. On March 31, the National Weather Service confirmed that it was an EF1 tornado. Strong hail came with it. Although there were no fatalities, 30 homes were damaged and eight mobile homes destroyed. Many vehicles could be seen on their side afterwards, and holes were put in houses from the hail.
