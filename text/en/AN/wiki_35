<text>Alpheus or Alpheios (; , meaning &quot;whitish&quot;), was in Greek mythology a river (the modern Alfeios River) and river god.

== Family ==

Like most river gods, Alpheus was a son of the Titans Oceanus and his sister-wife Tethys. Telegone, daughter of Pharis, bore his son, the king Orsilochus. Through him, Alpheus was the grandfather of Diocles, and great-grandfather of a pair of soldiers, Crethon and Orsilochus, who were slain by Aeneas during the Trojan War. The river god was also called the father of Melantheia who became the mother of Eirene by Poseidon. In later accounts, Alpheus (Alphionis) was the father of Phoenissa, possible mother of Endymion by Zeus.

== Mythology ==

According to Pausanias, Alpheus was a passionate hunter and fell in love with the nymph Arethusa, but she fled from him to the island of Ortygia near Syracuse, and metamorphosed herself into a well, after which Alpheus became a river, which flowing from the Peloponnese under the sea to Ortygia, there united its waters with those of the well Arethusa. The well of Arethusa is a symbol of Syracuse. This story is related somewhat differently by the Roman writer Ovid: Arethusa, a beautiful nymph, once while bathing in the river Alpheus in Arcadia, was surprised and pursued by the river god; but the goddess Artemis took pity upon her and changed her into a well, which flowed under the earth to the island of Ortygia. Alpheus took on water form jumping into the stream, but the earth opened and the stream flew underground to appear in a bay near Syracuse, near the island Ortygia, a location sacred to Artemis.

According to other traditions, Artemis herself was the object of the love of Alpheus. Once, it is said, when pursued by him she fled to Letrini in Elis, and here she covered her face and those of her companions (nymphs) with mud, so that Alpheus could not discover or distinguish her, and was obliged to return. This occasioned the building of a temple of Artemis Alphaea at Letrini. According to another version, the goddess fled to Ortygia, where she had likewise a temple under the name of Alphaea. An allusion to Alpheius&#x27; love of Artemis is also contained in the fact that at Olympia the two divinities had one altar in common.

In these accounts two or more distinct stories seem to be mixed up together, but they probably originated in the popular belief that there was a natural subterranean communication between the river Alpheios and the well Arethusa. It was believed that a cup thrown into the Alpheius would make its reappearance in the well Arethusa in Ortygia. Plutarch gives an account which is altogether unconnected with those mentioned above. According to him, Alpheius was a son of Helios, and killed his brother Cercaphus in a contest. Haunted by despair and the Erinyes he leapt into the river Nyctimus which afterwards received the name Alpheius.

Alpheus was also the river which Heracles, in the fifth of his labours, rerouted in order to clean the filth from the Augean Stables in a single day, a task which had been presumed to be impossible.

== Roman references ==

Alpheus is often associated with Antinous, the lover of the Roman Emperor Hadrian. Antinous was a Greek youth who had drowned in the Nile River. After he was deified, coins of the period depict him as Alpheios or Hadrian with Alpheios.

<doc id="77962" wikidata="Q404844" url="?curid=77962" title="Aegyptus">
<text>In Greek mythology, Aegyptus or Ægyptus (; ) was a legendary king of ancient Egypt. He was a descendant of the princess Io through his father Belus, and of the river-god Nilus as both the father of Achiroe, his mother and as a great, great-grandfather on his father&#x27;s side.

== Family ==
Aegyptos was the son of King Belus of Egypt and Achiroe, a naiad daughter of Nile, or of Sida, eponym of Sidon. He was the twin brother of Danaus, king of Libya while Euripides adds two others, Cepheus, king of Ethiopia and Phineus, betrothed of Andromeda. He may be the same or different from another Aegyptus who was called the son of Zeus and Thebe.

Aegyptus fathered fifty sons by different women: six of whom by a woman of royal blood called Argyphia; ten by an Arabian woman; seven by a Phoenician woman; three by Tyria; twelve by the naiad Caliadne; six by Gorgo and lastly another six by Hephaestine. According to Hippostratus, Aegyptus had these progeny by a single woman called Eurryroe, daughter of Nilus. In some accounts, Aegyptus consorted with Isaie while Danaus married Melia, these two women were daughters of their uncle Agenor, king of Tyre, and of their possible sister, Damno who was described as the daughter of Belus.

== Mythology ==
Aegyptus ruled Arabia and conquered nearby country ruled by people called Melampodes/Melampods and called it by his name, Egypt. Aegyptus fathered fifty sons, who were all but one murdered by forty nine of the fifty daughters of Aegyptus&#x27; twin brother, Danaus, eponym of the Danaïdes.

A scholium on a line in Euripides, &quot;Hecuba&quot; 886, reverses these origins, placing the twin brothers at first in Argolis, whence Aegyptus was expelled and fled to the land that was named after him. In the more common version, Aegyptus commanded that his fifty sons marry the fifty Danaïdes, and Danaus with his daughters fled to Argos, ruled by Pelasgus or by Gelanor, whom Danaus replaced. When Aegyptus and his sons arrived to take the Danaïdes, Danaus relinquished them, to spare the Argives the pain of a battle; however, he instructed his daughters to kill their husbands on their wedding night. Forty-nine followed through, but one, Hypermnestra (&quot;greatly wooed&quot;), refused, because her husband, Lynceus the &quot;lynx-man&quot;, honored her wish to remain a virgin. Danaus was angry with his disobedient daughter and threw her to the Argive courts. Aphrodite intervened and saved her. Lynceus and Hypermnestra founded the lineage of Argive kings, a Danaid Dynasty.

In some versions, Lynceus later slew Danaus as revenge for the death of his brothers, and the Danaïdes were punished in the underworld by being forced to carry water with a jug with holes, or a sieve, so that the water always leaked out.

The story of Danaus and his daughters, and the reason for their flight from marriage, provided the theme of Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;The Suppliants&quot;.

<doc id="77965" wikidata="Q210883" url="?curid=77965" title="Danaus">
<text>In Greek mythology, Danaus (, ; &quot;Danaós&quot;) was the king of Libya. His myth is a foundation legend of Argos, one of the foremost Mycenaean cities of the Peloponnesus. In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, &quot;Danaans&quot; (&quot;tribe of Danaus&quot;) and &quot;Argives&quot; commonly designate the Greek forces opposed to the Trojans.

== Family ==
===Parents and siblings===
Danaus, was the son of King Belus of Egypt and the naiad Achiroe, daughter of the river god Nilus, or of Sida, eponym of Sidon. He was the twin brother of Aegyptus, king of Egypt while Euripides adds two others, Cepheus, King of Ethiopia and Phineus, betrothed of Andromeda.

===Danaides===
Danaus had fifty daughters, the Danaides, twelve of whom were born to the naiad Polyxo; six to Pieria; two to Elephantis; four to Queen Europa; ten to the hamadryad nymphs Atlanteia and Phoebe; seven to an Aethiopian woman; three to Memphis; two to Herse and lastly four to Crino. According to Hippostratus, Danaus had all these progenies begotten by Europa, the daughter of Nilus. In some accounts, Danaus married Melia while Aegyptus consorted with Isaie, these two women were daughters of their uncle Agenor, King of Tyre, and their possible sister, Damno who was described as the daughter of Belus.

== Mythology ==

===Flight from Aegyptus===

After Aegyptus commanded that his fifty sons should marry the Danaides, Danaus elected to flee instead. To that purpose, he built a ship on the advice of Athena, the first ship that ever was. In it, he fled to Argos, to which he was connected by his descent from Io, a priestess of Hera at Argos, who was wooed by Zeus and turned into a heifer and pursued by Hera until she found asylum in Egypt. Argos at the time was ruled by King Pelasgus, the eponym of all autochthonous [indigenous] inhabitants who had lived in Greece since the beginning, also called Gelanor (&quot;he who laughs&quot;). The Danaides asked Pelasgus for protection when they arrived, the event portrayed in &quot;The Suppliants&quot; by Aeschylus. Protection was granted after a vote by the Argives. 

When Pausanias visited Argos in the 2nd century CE, he related the succession of Danaus to the throne, judged by the Argives, who &quot;from the earliest times ... have loved freedom and self-government, and they limited to the utmost the authority of their kings&quot;: 

: &quot;On coming to Argos he claimed the kingdom against Gelanor, the son of Sthenelus. Many plausible arguments were brought forward by both parties, and those of Sthenelas were considered as fair as those of his opponent; so the people, who were sitting in judgment, put off, they say, the decision to the following day. At dawn a wolf fell upon a herd of oxen that was pasturing before the wall, and attacked and fought with the bull that was the leader of the herd. It occurred to the Argives that Gelanor was like the bull and Danaus like the wolf, for as the wolf will not live with men, so Danaus up to that time had not lived with them. It was because the wolf overcame the bull that Danaus won the kingdom. Accordingly, believing that Apollo had brought the wolf on the herd, he founded a sanctuary of Apollo Lycius.&quot;

The sanctuary of Apollo Lykeios (&quot;wolf-Apollo&quot;, but also Apollo of the twilight) was still the most prominent feature of Argos in Pausanias&#x27; time: in the sanctuary, the tourist might see the throne of Danaus himself, an eternal flame, called the fire of Phoroneus.

===Murdered bridegrooms===

When Aegyptus and his fifty sons arrived to take the Danaides, Danaus gave them in order to spare the Argives the pain of a battle. However, he instructed his daughters to kill their husbands on their wedding night. Forty-nine followed through and subsequently buried the heads of their bridegrooms in Lerna; but one, Hypermnestra, refused because her husband, Lynceus, honored her wish to remain a virgin. Danaus was angry with his disobedient daughter and threw her to the Argive courts. Aphrodite intervened and saved her. Lynceus and Hypermnestra then began a dynasty of Argive kings (the Danaid Dynasty). Some sources relate that Amymone, the &quot;blameless&quot; Danaid, and/or Bryce (Bebryce) also spared their husbands.

===Aftermath===
After his sons&#x27; deaths, Aegyptus escaped to Aroe in Greece and died there. His monument was shown in the temple of Serapis at Patrae.

In some versions, Lynceus later killed Danaus as revenge for the death of his brothers.

The remaining forty-nine Danaides had their grooms chosen by a common mythic competition: A foot-race was held, and the order in which the potential Argive grooms finished decided their brides (compare the myth of Atalanta). Two of the grooms were Archander and Architeles, sons of Achaeus: They married Scaea and Automate, respectively.

In later accounts, the Danaides were punished in Tartarus by being forced to carry water in a jug to fill a bath without a bottom (or with a leak) and thereby wash off their sins, but the bath was never filled because the water was always leaking out.

===Danaus in Rhodes===
Another account of the travels of Danaus gave him three daughters, Ialysos, Kamiros and Lindos, who were worshipped in the cities that took their names in the island of Rhodes, Ialysos, Kamiros and Lindos (but see also Cercaphus). According to Rhodian mythographers who informed Diodorus Siculus, Danaus would have stopped and founded a sanctuary to Athena Lindia on the way from Egypt to Greece. Herodotus heard that Danaus&#x27; daughters founded the temple at Lindos. Ken Dowden observes that once the idea is dismissed that myth is directly narrating the movements of historical persons, that the loci of Danaian institutions at Lindos in Rhodes as well as at Argos suggest a Mycenaean colony sent to Rhodes from the Argolid, a tradition, in fact, that Strabo reports.

=== Other feats ===
Danaus was credited as the inventor of wells and is said to have migrated from Egypt about 1485 B.C. into that part of Greece previously known as Argos Dipsion. Notes in Pliny the Elder&#x27;s, &quot;Natural History&quot; also added that:

: &quot;He [i.e., Danaus] may have introduced wells into Greece, but they had, long before his time, been employed in Egypt and in other countries. The term &quot;Dipsion,&quot; &quot;thirsting,&quot; which it appears had been applied to the district of Argos, may seem to render it probable, that, before the arrival of Danaus, the inhabitants had not adopted any artificial means of supplying themselves with water. But this country, we are told, is naturally well supplied with water.&quot;

The town Apobathmi  in ancient Argolis took its name from Danaus landing at this spot.

==The &quot;Danais&quot;==
The epic Danais was written by one of the cyclic poets; the name of the author and the narration of these events does not survive, but the Danaid tetralogy of Aeschylus undoubtedly draws upon its material. It is represented in the table of epics in the received canon on the very fragmentary &quot;Borgia table&quot; as &quot;Danaides&quot;.

A U.S. federal judge used the version of the legend in which the Danaides are forced to perform an impossible task as a simile for the judge&#x27;s task of determining whether a case &quot;arises under&quot; the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.

<text>Hypermnestra (, &quot;Hypermnēstra&quot;), in Greek mythology, was a Libyan princess and, as one of the 50 Danaids, the daughters of King Danaus, son of King Belus of Egypt. Her mother was Elephantis. She was the full sister to Gorgophone.

==Mythology==
Hypermnestra&#x27;s father, Danaus, was the twin brother of Aegyptus, who demanded the marriage between the Danaids and his 50 sons. But her father Danaus, who was unhappy with this kind of arrangement, ordered them to flee to Argos where King Pelasgus (Gelanor) ruled. When Aegyptus and his sons arrived to take the Danaides, Danaus gave them up to spare the Argives the pain of a battle. However, Danaus instructed Hypermnestra and the other Danaids to kill their husbands on their wedding night. Her forty-nine sisters followed through, except her, because her husband, Lynceus, honored her wish to remain a virgin. Danaus was angry with this disobedience and threw her to the Argive courts. Aphrodite intervened and saved Hypermnestra. Lynceus later killed Danaus as revenge for the death of his brothers. Hypermnestra and Lynceus&#x27; son, Abas, would be the first king of the Danaid Dynasty. In some versions of the legend, the Danaides were punished in the underworld by being forced to carry water in a jug with holes, or a sieve, so the water always leaked out. Hypermnestra, however, went straight to Elysium.

==Cultural depictions==
Ovid wrote a letter from Hypermnestra to Lynceus, which appears in his &quot;Heroides&quot;.

Geoffrey Chaucer wrote a &quot;Legend of Hypermnestra&quot;.

Francesco Cavalli wrote &quot;Hipermestra&quot;, first performed at Florence on 12 June 1658, as a festa teatrale opera.

Hypermnestra is referred to in John Webster&#x27;s tragedy &#x27;The White Devil&#x27;, in a speech by the scheming courtesan Flamineo:
&quot;...Trust a woman? never, never... We lay&quot;
&quot;our souls to pawn to the devil for a little pleasure, and a woman makes&quot;
&quot;the bill of sale. That ever man should marry! For one Hypermnestra&quot;
&quot;that saved her lord and husband, forty-nine of her sisters cut their&quot;
&quot;husbands&#x27; throats all in one night.&quot;

Charles-Hubert Gervais composed the opera &quot;Hypermnestre&quot;, first performed at the Académie Royale de Musique (the Paris Opera) on 3 November 1716.

Ignaz Holzbauer composed a German opera entitled &quot;Hypermnestra&quot; with a German libretto by Johann Leopold van Ghelen that was performed in Vienna in 1741.

Antonio Salieri composed the opera &quot;Les Danaïdes&quot; with a French libretto by François-Louis Gand Le Bland Du Roullet and Louis-Théodore de Tschudi in 1784, premiering in Paris.

<doc id="77969" wikidata="Q7877819" url="?curid=77969" title="Lynceus (son of Aegyptus)">
<text>In Greek mythology, Lynceus (; ) was a king of Argos, succeeding Danaus on the throne.

== Family ==
Lynceus was named as a descendant of Belus through his father Aegyptus, who was the twin brother of Danaus, father of fifty daughters called Danaïdes. He had forty-nine siblings and out of them had five full brothers namely Proteus, Busiris, Enceladus Lycus and Daiphron through their mother Argyphia, a woman of royal blood.

By Hypermnestra, Lynceus became the father of Abas, who succeeded him as king.

== Mythology ==
Lynceus&#x27;s father, Aegyptus, commanded that his sons should marry the Danaïdes, but Danaus, together with his daughters, fled to Argos where King Pelasgus ruled. Then Lynceus and his brothers and father arrived to take the Danaïdes. Danaus gave them to spare the Argives the pain of a battle. However, he instructed his daughters to kill their husbands on their wedding night. Forty-nine followed through, but one, Hypermnestra refused because Lynceus honored her wish to remain a virgin. Danaus was angry with his disobedient daughter and threw her to the Argive courts, but Aphrodite intervened and saved her. Lynceus later killed Danaus as revenge for the death of his brothers. Lynceus and Hypermnestra then began a dynasty of Argive kings (the Danaid Dynasty) beginning with Abas. In some versions of the legend, the Danaïdes, minus Hypermnestra (or sometimes alternately Amymone), were punished in Tartarus by being forced to carry water through a jug with holes, or a sieve, so the water always leaked out.

<text>Year 462 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Tricipitinus and Cicurinus (or, less frequently, year 292 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 462 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

=== By place ===
==== Greece ====
* The Spartans try to conquer the mountain stronghold of Mt Ithome in Messenia, where a large force of rebellious helots have taken refuge. They ask their allies from the Persian Wars, including the Athenians, to help.
* Kimon seeks the support of Athens&#x27; citizens providing help to Sparta. Although Ephialtes maintains that Sparta is Athens&#x27; rival for power and should be left to fend for itself, Kimon&#x27;s view prevails. Kimon then leads 4,000 hoplites to Mount Ithome.
* After an attempt to storm Mt. Ithome fails, the Spartans start to distrust the Athenians over concerns that they may take the side of the helots. Retaining their other allies, the Spartans sent Kimon and his men home. This insulting rebuff causes the collapse of Kimon&#x27;s popularity at Athens. Outrage over the dismissal swings Athenian opinion towards Ephialtes&#x27; views.
* Ephialtes passes a law in the Athenian ecclesia, which reforms the Areopagus, limiting its power to judging cases of homicide and religious crimes. He considers the Areopagus to be the centre of conservatism and Ephialtes&#x27; victory is seen as a defeat for the conservatives and the members of the oligarchy.
* Argos, taking advantage of Spartan preoccupation with the revolt of its helots, finally conquers Mycenae. The inhabitants of the town are dispersed, with some finding their way into Macedonia.
* Pericles starts to effectively be the leader of Athens.

==== Philosophy ====
* The Greek philosopher, Anaxagoras, moves to Athens and begins teaching there.

<doc id="77972" wikidata="Q117758" url="?curid=77972" title="Flag of Kiribati">
<text>The flag of [[Kiribati]] () is red in the upper half with a gold frigatebird (&quot;Fregata minor&quot;, in Gilbertese: &quot;te eitei&quot;) flying over a gold rising sun (&quot;otintaai&quot;), and the lower half is blue with three horizontal wavy white stripes to represent the ocean and the three archipelagoes (Gilbert, Phoenix and Line Islands). The 17 rays of the sun represent the 16 Gilbert Islands and Banaba (former Ocean Island).

The yellow frigatebird symbolises command over the sea, freedom, and dance patterns. The blue and white wavy bands represent the Pacific Ocean, which surrounds Kiribati, and the sun refers to Kiribati&#x27;s position astride the Equator.

The flag is derived from a badge designed by Sir Arthur Grimble in 1931 for the flag of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands British colony and granted in 1937.

==Official description==

Following the schedule 2 (section 8) of the National Identity Act of 1989, the official description is this one:
*&quot;The bird is a frigate bird which represents power, freedom and Kiribati cultural dance patterns&quot;.
*&quot;The rising sun is the tropical sun as Kiribati lies astride the Equator&quot;.
*&quot;The sea is the Pacific Ocean which surrounds Kiribati&quot;.

== History ==

Kiribati&#x27;s flag is an armorial banner, a flag having a design corresponding exactly to that of the shield in the coat of arms, the former badge of the flag of the British colony of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands. In a letter on 15 August 1892 to the Western Pacific High Commissioner, Arthur Grimble has written (concerning his badge proposal):
*&quot;Sea. Represents the space of the ocean in which the colony is isolated&quot;.
*&quot;Sun. The islands lie close to the 180 degree meridian. Sun is either rising or setting&quot;.
*&quot;Bird. Frigate bird (&quot;Fregat Aquilla&quot; (&quot;sic&quot;)) symbolises power, poise and freedom. To the natives it is a sign of sovereignty and kingly birth, and highly regarded as such&quot;.

The coat of arms dates was then granted by the College of Arms in May 1937 when it was officially granted to the colony of Gilbert and Ellice Islands. The shield was incorporated into the centre of the fly half of a British Blue Ensign as the state ensign of the colony.

Shortly before independence was granted in 1979, a local competition was held to choose a new national flag, and a design based on the colonial coat of arms was submitted to the College of Arms. The College of Arms decided to modify this design. Both the golden frigatebird and the sun were enlarged to occupy more of the top of the flag, and the width of the blue and white wavy bands was reduced. The local people, however, insisted on the original design, in which the top and bottom halves of the flag were equal, the sun and local frigate bird small, and the various design elements outlined in black. The new flag was hoisted during the independence day celebrations in the capital, Tarawa, on 12 July 1979.

The denomination 460 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Persian Empire ====
* Egypt revolts against Persian rule. The Egyptian leader, Inaros, asks Athens for assistance, which is willingly provided as Athens has plans to trade with and colonise Egypt. A force of 200 Athenian triremes, which is campaigning in Cyprus, is immediately ordered to Egypt to render assistance.
* Achaemenes, Persian satrap (governor) of Egypt, is defeated and slain in a battle at Papremis, on the banks of the Nile River, by Egyptian forces.
* The construction of the ceremonial complex of Apadana (the audience hall of Darius I and Xerxes I) in Persepolis is completed.

==== Greece ====
* The First Peloponnesian War breaks out between the Delian League (led by Athens) and a Peloponnesian alliance (led by Sparta), caused in part by Athens&#x27; alliance with Megara and Argos and the subsequent reaction of Sparta. The Athenians have built long walls for the Megarans to their port at Nisaea, thereby earning the enmity of Megara&#x27;s old rival Corinth.
* Argos rises against Sparta. Athens supports Argos and Thessaly. The small force that is sent by Sparta to quell the uprising in Argos is defeated by a joint Athenian and Argos force at Oenoe. (Battle of Oenoe)

==== Roman Republic ====
* Conflicts arise between the Roman patricians and plebeians. There is also a revolt by Rome&#x27;s slaves. During the revolt, the Campidoglio is held by the slaves for a lengthy period, along with the most important temples of Rome. It is during this revolt that consul Publius Valerius Publicola dies. The revolt only ends with the arrival of an army from Tusculum, led by Tusculan dictator Lucius Mamilius. Meanwhile, Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus is appointed as consul to replace Publicola.

===Siculi===
* Ducetius, a Hellenised leader of the Siculi, an ancient people of Sicily, takes advantage of the confusion that follows the collapse of the tyranny in Syracuse and other Sicilian states. With the support of the Syracusan democracy, he drives out the colonists of the former tyrant Hieron from Catana and restores it to its original inhabitants.

=== By topic ===

==== Arts ====
* Polygnotos of Thasos decorates the Painted Stoa, on the north side of Ancient Agora of Athens (approximate date).
* The construction of a sculpture of a &quot;Young Warrior&quot; (subsequently found in the sea off Riace, Italy) is begun and completed approximately ten years later. It is now preserved at the Museo Archeologico Nazionale, Reggio Calabria, Italy.
* The sculpture &quot;Apollo with battling Lapiths and centaurs&quot; is built on the west pediment of the Temple of Zeus in Olympia (approximate date). Only fragments remain and are today preserved at the Archaeological museum in Olympia.
* A metope relief of &quot;Athena, Heracles and Atlas&quot; are made on a frieze in the Temple of Zeus in Olympia (approximate date). It is now preserved at the Archaeological museum in Olympia.
* A statue of Apollo is cast (approximate date), of which today remains one leg, preserved at the Louvre, and the head, known as the Chatsworth Head, preserved at the British Museum.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
== Births ==
* Democritus of Abdera, Greek philosopher (approximate year) (d. 370 BC)
* Hippocrates of Cos, Greek physician (approximate year) (d. 375 BC)

* Panini, Hindu Indian grammarian (b. 520 BC)
* Themistocles, Athenian politician and naval strategist (b. 525 BC)

=== By place ===
==== Rome ====
* The Senate and People of Rome appoint Gaius Aemilius Mamercus interrex.
==== Greece ====
* In Athens, the democratic statesman Ephialtes and the young Pericles attempt to get the oligarchic Kimon ostracized for allegedly receiving bribes. Kimon is charged by Pericles and other democratic politicians with having been bribed not to attack the King of Macedonia (who may have been suspected of covertly helping the Thasian rebels). Though Kimon is acquitted, his influence on the Athenian people is waning.
* Themistocles, who is in exile, approaches the Persian King Artaxerxes I seeking Persian help in regaining power in Athens. Artaxerxes is unwilling to help him, but gives him the satrapy of Magnesia.
* After a two year siege, Thasos falls to the Athenians under Kimon who compels the Thasians to destroy their walls, surrender their ships, pay an indemnity and an annual contribution to Athens.

==== Greece ====
* Cimon carries the war against Persia into Asia Minor and wins the Battle of the Eurymedon in Pamphylia. This is a decisive defeat of the Persians as Cimon&#x27;s land and sea forces capture the Persian camp and destroy or capture the entire Persian fleet of 200 triremes (manned by Phoenicians). Many new allies of Athens are now recruited, such as the trading city of Phaselis on the Lycian-Pamphylian border.

==== Italy ====
* The Tyrant, Thrasybulus, is driven out by the citizens of Syracuse, Sicily. The city moves to a democratic system of government.
* The Greek colony of Taras, in Magna Graecia, is defeated by the native population of Apulia. As a result, the Tarentine monarchy falls, with the installation of a democracy.

<doc id="77985" wikidata="Q2701696" url="?curid=77985" title="Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex">
<text>Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex, KB, PC (; 11 January 1591 – 14 September 1646) was an English Parliamentarian and soldier during the first half of the 17th century. With the start of the Civil War in 1642, he became the first Captain-General and Chief Commander of the Parliamentarian army, also known as the Roundheads. However, he was unable and unwilling to score a decisive blow against the Royalist army of King Charles I. He was eventually overshadowed by the ascendancy of Oliver Cromwell and Thomas Fairfax, and resigned his commission in 1646.

==Youth and personal life==
Robert Devereux was the son and heir of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, the courtier and soldier from the later reign of Queen Elizabeth I. His mother was Frances Walsingham (1567–1633), the only daughter of Sir Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth&#x27;s spymaster. He was born at the home of his grandmother, Lady Walsingham, in Seething Lane, London.

His education continued at Eton College and Merton College, Oxford, being created MA by the university in 1605.

The 2nd Earl led an unsuccessful rebellion against Elizabeth in 1601. He was subsequently executed for treason and the family lost its title. However, King James I chose to restore it after he became King of England. In 1604, Robert Devereux became the 3rd Earl of Essex. The young earl became a close friend of Henry Stuart, Prince of Wales.

Essex was married at age 13 to the 14-year-old Frances Howard; he was then sent on a European tour from 1607 to 1609, apparently without having consummated the marriage. Meanwhile, his wife began an affair with Robert Carr, Viscount Rochester, a favourite of King James I. After Essex&#x27;s return, Frances sought an annulment on the grounds of impotence. Essex claimed that he was only impotent with her and had been perfectly capable with other women, adding that she &quot;reviled him, and miscalled him, terming him a cow and coward, and beast.&quot; 

The divorce was a public spectacle and it made Essex a laughing stock at court. It was small comfort that the finding that Frances was still a virgin was greeted with equal derision: as a popular ballad put it &quot;The Dame was inspected, but fraud interjected a Maid of greater perfection.&quot; The annulment was granted on 25 September 1613, and Frances married her lover, who had been made 1st Earl of Somerset, on 26 December 1613. Three years later the Somersets were tried by a panel of Lords for their part in the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury; Essex sat as a juror in the trial of his former wife and pressed the King to send her to the scaffold. Both were condemned to death, but the sentence was not carried out.

On 11 March 1630, Essex married Elizabeth Pawlett, daughter of Sir William Pawlett, of Edington, Wiltshire, past High Sheriff of Wiltshire and cousin of William Paulet, 4th Marquess of Winchester. Elizabeth was introduced at Court during the Great Parliament of 1628/29 just after her father died, as the eldest unmarried daughter needing to marry to improve her family prospects. Back from travels in military service on the Continent (see below) Robert was also pressured to marry again (and quickly) to show the Court the humiliation from his first marriage could be overcome. This marriage was also a disaster and failed, though not as publicly. They separated in 1631, the Countess remaining at Essex House in the Strand, London, Robert &quot;playing soldiers&quot; at his estates.

There was a son from the union, Robert, styled Viscount Hereford, who was born on 5 November 1636 and died of plague a month later. Essex, who had given the birth date as a deadline beyond which he would have disowned the child, grudgingly acknowledged him as his own; however, the father was widely suspected by the Court to be Elizabeth&#x27;s alleged lover, Sir Thomas Uvedale (from the alleged prompting of William Seymour, 1st Marquess of Hertford, Robert&#x27;s brother-in-law who leased part of Essex House in London, and expected to inherit if Robert had no issue). Elizabeth, through her funeral oration (in 1656) by her second husband Sir Thomas Higgons, vigorously denied this.

==Military career: 1620–1640==
In 1620 Essex embarked on what was to be an undistinguished military career prior to the start of the First English Civil War. Between 1620 and 1624 he served in Protestant armies in Germany and the Low Countries. In 1620 he joined Sir Horace Vere&#x27;s expedition to defend the Palatine. In 1621 he served with Prince Maurice of Nassau, and in 1622 with Count Ernst von Mansfeld (battle of Fleurus, 29 August 1622). In 1624 he commanded a regiment in the unsuccessful campaign to relieve the siege of Breda.

In 1625, under Sir Edward Cecil, he commanded a squadron as vice-admiral and as colonel of a foot regiment in the failed English expedition to Cadiz.

Despite the lack of distinction, this period of his life gave him a good working knowledge of continental war methods and strategies, even if most of his own experience was limited to defensive operations. Every drive he made to recruit volunteers for these expeditions was successful, such was the loyalty he could command.

Following a period of little distinguished activity in the 1630s, Essex, who had been made Knight of the Bath in 1638, served in the army of King Charles I during the first Scottish Bishops&#x27; War in 1639 as Lieutenant-General of the army in the North of England. However, he was denied a command in the second, which took place in 1640. This pushed him further into the arms of the growing number of the King&#x27;s opponents in Parliament.

==Role in starting the English Civil War: 1640–1642==
Robert Devereux&#x27;s opposition to the Stuart monarchy as a leader of the Country party in the House of Lords was established in the 1620s along with the Earls of Oxford, Southampton, Warwick, Lords Say and Spencer. During one exchange the animosity of King James was evident when he said, &quot;I fear thee not, Essex, if thou wert as well beloved as thy father, and hadst 40,000 men at thy heels.&quot;

When King James&#x27; son, Charles convened the Short Parliament in 1640 he had ruled without Parliament for 11 years. He was forced to call another one to raise money to fight insurgencies in Scotland and Ireland. However, many Parliamentarians sought to use the new Parliament to bring the King to account. Relations between Charles and his Parliament quickly broke down.
Essex was a strong Protestant and he had a reputation for being one of the puritan nobles in the House of Lords. He was friends with John Pym, one of the strongest critics of Charles in the House of Commons during the Short Parliament and its successor the Long Parliament.

In 1641, Parliament passed a Bill of Attainder against the King&#x27;s minister Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford, who was fiercely loyal to Charles. This resulted in Strafford&#x27;s execution: of all Strafford&#x27;s enemies Essex was perhaps the most implacable, dismissing appeals for mercy with the proverb &quot;Stone dead hath no fellow.&quot; In an attempt at reconciliation with Parliament, Charles gave royal assent to the Bill of Attainder and invited leading Parliamentary critics to join his Privy Council.

Essex supported the action against Strafford and was appointed to the Privy Council. He was made Captain General of the royal armed forces south of the River Trent in February and was made Lord Chamberlain in July. However, the relationship between Charles and his Parliament deteriorated further.

On 4 January 1642, Charles went to the House of Commons to arrest Pym and four other members for their alleged treason. Essex had tipped off the five members about what the King was planning to do. Charles was humiliated when he entered the House of Commons only to find that the five members had fled. In that same month, Essex began to absent himself from Charles&#x27;s court. In April he was dismissed from the office of Lord Chamberlain when he failed to join the King at York. His position as Captain-General of the southern forces was deemed to have lapsed.

As the unprecedented prospect of a military confrontation between the King and Parliament grew, on 4 July 1642 Parliament voted to create a Committee of Safety consisting of ten Members of the House of Commons and five peers, of which Essex was one alongside the Earl of Northumberland, the Earl of Pembroke, the Earl of Holland and Viscount Saye and Sele. Pym, John Hampden and Denzil Holles were the leading members of the committee from the Commons. This committee was supposed to act as a bridge between Members of Parliament and the armed forces supporting them in the field. At this point, these armies primarily consisted of regional defence militias and city-trained bands who were sympathetic to the Parliamentary cause.

On 12 July, Parliament went one step further and voted to raise an army of its own. As one of the few English nobles with any military experience, Essex was chosen to lead it. The Parliamentary ordinance that was passed proclaimed Essex to be:Captain-General and Chief Commander of the Army appointed to be raised, and of all other Forces of the Kingdom...and that he the said Earl shall have and enjoy all Power, Titles, Preheminence, Authority, Jurisdiction and Liberties, incident and belonging to the said Office of Captain-General, throughout the whole Kingdom of England and Dominion of Wales, in as large and ample a Manner as any other General of an Army in this Kingdom hath lawfully used exercised, and enjoyed.He accepted the commission. Parliament also bolstered his territorial power by reappointing him Lord Lieutenant of the counties of Yorkshire and Staffordshire, and appointing him that of Montgomeryshire, Herefordshire and Shropshire.

==Role in the First English Civil War: 1642–1646==
Essex had been put in a difficult position in 1642. Parliament had voted to raise an army to counter the Royalist one Charles was leading but it was collectively unsure about how to conduct it. This state of affairs was unprecedented in English history. Parliamentarians wanted to make a deal with the King on their terms but they did not want to commit treason.
The Parliamentary ordinance that commissioned Essex to his post of Captain-General gave him the task of &quot;preserving the Safety of his Majesty&#x27;s Person&quot;. It did not specifically instruct him to engage the King in battle as this would have been treason. It conveniently blamed the brewing troubles on those surrounding the King rather than Charles himself, specifically &quot;the cunning practice of Papists, and malicious Counsels of divers ill-affected Persons, inciting his Majesty to raise men&quot;. It also bound Essex to, &quot;execute the Office of Captain-General, in such Manner, and according to such Instructions, as he shall, from Time to Time, receive from both Houses of Parliament&quot;, which was inevitably going to be a constraint on his ability to command an army. All these elements were a weight on the mind of Essex. It is to his credit that he was actually able to raise an army that was capable of fighting the royalist forces in battle.

On 22 August 1642, Charles raised his standard at Nottingham Castle. pronouncing Essex and by extension Parliament traitors. This was a symbolic declaration of war against Parliament. It was clear from this point onwards that the two armies would engage in battle at some point, starting the English Civil War. However, the majority of those supporting Parliament were still fearful of committing treason against the King and this inhibited them in the early years of the conflict. They were also well aware that an agreement with Charles would be necessary to achieve the future settlement of the kingdom once the war was over. A republican settlement was not the objective of the Parliamentary army at this point or during Essex&#x27;s lifetime. This inevitably gave Charles the upper hand at first.

Royalist MPs gradually filtered away from parliament during 1642. They later joined a rival Parliament in Oxford set up by the King. The remnants of the Long Parliament gradually split into two camps. One wished to defeat the King in battle. The other, known as the peace party, wanted to force Charles to the negotiating table rather than defeat him. Pym led the &quot;middle group&quot;, which sought to maintain good relations between the two.

Essex&#x27;s commitment to the Parliamentary cause never wavered. However, his sympathies lay with the peace party throughout the conflict. This undermined his effectiveness as a military leader.

===Battle of Edgehill, 23 October 1642===

Following several minor skirmishes, the first major engagement between the two armies took place at the Battle of Edgehill on 23 October 1642. Both sides had raised impressive armies. Essex&#x27;s lifeguard included Henry Ireton, Charles Fleetwood, Thomas Harrison, Nathaniel Rich, Edmund Ludlow, Matthew Tomlinson and Francis Russell. All of them played a leading role in the civil war and its aftermath but a degree of amateurism and bad discipline was evident on both sides during the battle.
Following a brief exchange of artillery fire, the battle began with a Royalist cavalry charge led by Prince Rupert of the Rhine. A second Royalist cavalry charge followed, led by Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester. Both the right and left flanks of the Parliamentarian horse were scattered. The Royalist cavalry, with their eye on the baggage train, unwisely chose to pursue the fleeing Parliamentarian horsemen but Essex had kept two cavalry regiments in reserve. As the rival infantry divisions engaged in combat, with Essex fighting alongside his troops with a pike, the two remaining Parliamentarian cavalry regiments made a devastating attack on the exposed Royalist foot soldiers.

Both sides incurred heavy losses and the battle ended in stalemate after Rupert&#x27;s cavalry returned to stop a rout. Both armies spent the night in the field before Essex withdrew the Parliamentarians to Warwick the next day.

This battle and its aftermath portrayed the strengths and weaknesses of Essex&#x27;s military mindset. His planning and leadership had allowed the Parliamentarian forces to stand their ground. However, his defensive caution and his unwillingness to engage the enemy led to his army being outmanoeuvred. Although Essex had begun his military preparations in London, prior to the battle Charles had been able to position his army in between the Parliamentarian forces and London. This left the road to London open to Charles at the end of the battle. The King had also been able to engage Essex&#x27;s army before the Parliamentarians were at full strength. On the day of the battle, Essex was still waiting for the arrival of John Hampden&#x27;s two cavalry regiments and most of the Parliamentary artillery.

Luckily for Essex, Charles did not take much advantage of this superior position. The King chose to make an assault on London with his army at full strength, as he too was awaiting the arrival of more soldiers from around the country. This allowed Essex and his army to make a break for London via Watling Street. Essex arrived back in London to a hero&#x27;s welcome on 7 November, before Charles was able to get there.

===Battle of Brentford and the Battle of Turnham Green, 12–13 November 1642===

On 12 November Rupert&#x27;s Royalist army engaged in their first major assault in preparation for a march on London. A small Parliamentarian garrison suffered heavy losses at the Battle of Brentford. The Royalists proceeded to sack the town. This galvanised sentiment in the City of London against a Royalist occupation.

On 13 November, Essex was able to muster 24,000 men for the Battle of Turnham Green, including the remnants of the Edgehill army and the City trained bands, as well as apprentices and militiamen from Hertfordshire, Essex and Surrey. Essex and Major-General Phillip Skippon were key to this display of force by placing their soldiers in effective defensive positions and by keeping up morale. Charles, with much smaller forces, did not engage in battle. His army retreated with only a handful of shots fired.

By the end of 1642, Essex&#x27;s forces were the weaker side against the Royalists but the Parliamentarians had the sympathy of the Scots and there were thousands of other troops ready to join their cause around the country. The scene was set for a long conflict.

===First Battle of Newbury, 20 September 1643===
After a long winter break, Essex&#x27;s army captured and occupied Reading on 26 April 1643 following a 10-day siege. Progress towards the King&#x27;s base at Oxford after this was slow. Some began to question the willingness of Essex to lead the Parliamentarians to victory in the developing civil war.

The fluctuating performance of his army in 1643 was in contrast to the ascendancy of the Eastern Association. This was an alliance of pro-Parliament militiamen from Essex, Hertfordshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire and Lincolnshire commanded by Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester. One of their cavalry commanders was Oliver Cromwell. The Eastern Association established itself as a formidable fighting force in 1643, thanks in a large part to Cromwell&#x27;s regiment, which became known as the &#x27;Ironsides&#x27;.

Nonetheless, 1643 was a good year overall for Essex&#x27;s army. In what was perhaps his finest hour, on 20 September, Essex&#x27;s forces came off as the stronger side in the First Battle of Newbury. Despite not winning a decisive victory, the Parliamentarians forced the Royalists to withdraw to Oxford. This gave the Parliamentary army a clear road between Reading and London.

===Lostwithiel Campaign, June–September 1644===

1644 proved to be the turning point in the First English Civil War. In February an alliance with the Scots was consolidated with the creation of the Committee of Both Kingdoms, to which Essex was appointed. This replaced the Committee of Safety. It gave the Parliamentarians an edge over the Royalists for the first time.

However, the year also saw the increasing polarisation of the Parliamentary alliance between the peace party and those who wished to defeat the King in battle. The death of Pym in December 1643 led to the demise of the middle group and also deprived Essex of a key ally in the House of Commons. A confrontation between the two sides became inevitable.

On 2 July 1644, Parliamentary commanders Lord Fairfax, Lord Leven and the Earl of Manchester defeated Royalist forces at the Battle of Marston Moor. The conduct of Cromwell, participating with the Eastern Association, was decisive in the victory.

Simultaneously, Essex pursued his campaign to conquer the West Country. This was a strange move and it was made against the advice of the Committee of Both Kingdoms. There was some sympathy for the Parliamentary cause in Devon and Dorset but in Royalist Cornwall, there was practically no support for the Parliamentarians at all.

Although the campaign started well, Essex&#x27;s army was forced to surrender in September at Lostwithiel after they were outmanoeuvred by the Royalists. The Earl himself escaped in a fishing boat to avoid humiliation. He left the task of surrendering to Skippon.

===End of military career===
The Lostwithiel campaign proved to be the end of Essex&#x27;s military career. His army participated in the Second Battle of Newbury on 27 October. However, the Earl was sick in Reading at the time. His conduct in the West Country had frustrated Cromwell, now the most prominent member of the House of Commons following his military victories and the deaths of Hampden and Pym.

Cromwell had become embroiled in a feud with the Earl of Manchester, who was still his superior officer in the Eastern Association. Essex and Manchester remained sympathetic to the peace party, while Cromwell had emerged as the leading voice in the campaign to fight a more aggressive war against Charles. Following a month of Parliamentary arguments between Manchester and Cromwell, with the former speaking in the House of Lords and the latter making his attacks in the House of Commons, the scene was set for a showdown.

On 19 December 1644, the first Self-Denying Ordinance was approved by the House of Commons. This proposed that all members of the House of Commons and the House of Lords be barred from exercising military commands. This was rejected by the Lords on 13 January 1645. However, on 21 January the Commons passed the New Model Ordinance. This was a proposal to create a united Parliamentary army. It was approved by the Lords on 15 February. Over a month of negotiations ensued between the Commons and the Lords concerning who was going to command this army.

On 2 April, Essex and Manchester gave way and resigned their commissions. The next day a revised Self-Denying Ordinance was approved by the House of Lords. This discharged members of both Houses from military commands but did not reject the possibility of their future reappointment. Although Essex still had many supporters in Parliament, he had enough opponents to block his re-emergence as a military leader at this stage.

These reforms led to the creation of the New Model Army led by Sir Thomas Fairfax, son of the victorious Lord Fairfax at the Battle of Marston Moor. Cromwell was swiftly appointed to the post of Lieutenant-General, Fairfax&#x27;s second-in-command.

==Death and funeral==
For the rest of his days, Essex was associated with the emerging Presbyterian faction in Parliament. One of his last political battles was his involvement with a plan to build up Edward Massey&#x27;s Western Association into an army capable of counterbalancing the New Model Army. Massey had been one of the few Parliamentary commanders to retain an independent commission when the New Model Army was formed. However, this plan failed when Parliament disbanded Massey&#x27;s army in October 1646.

In 1645, Essex was given Somerhill House near Tonbridge, Kent, which had been sequestrated by Parliament from his half-brother Ulick Burke, 5th Earl of Clanricarde, following the Battle of Naseby. On 1 December that year Parliament voted for him to be created a Duke but no elevation in his peerage followed.

The Earl of Essex died in September 1646 without an heir. After hunting in Windsor Forest he had a stroke on the 10th and died in London, at Essex House, four days later, aged fifty-five. The earldom died with him, until it was revived in 1661 for Arthur Capel. His death not only weakened the Presbyterian faction in Parliament, it also began the decline of the influence of the nobles who supported the Parliamentary cause. His viscountcy devolved on Walter Devereux, who was a younger grandson of the 1st viscount and cousin to the 1st Earl of Essex.

His death led to a large display of mourning. Parliament contributed £5,000 to the expenses of his funeral and he was buried in Westminster Abbey. For the occasion, the chancel of the Abbey was draped in black from floor to ceiling and a funeral effigy of the earl dressed in scarlet breeches, a military buff-coat and Parliamentary robes was erected beneath a catafalque designed by Inigo Jones. This was left standing after the ceremony until a poor farmer from Dorset, said to have been a former royalist soldier, hacked it down on the grounds that an angel had told him to do so. The effigy was restored but Charles II ordered that it be taken down during the Restoration, although – unlike most Puritans interred in the Abbey during the Civil War and Commonwealth – his body was allowed to remain buried.

The Dowager Countess of Essex remarried, in about 1647, to diplomat and politician Sir Thomas Higgons (1624–1691). By him, she had two daughters before dying in 1656.

==Cultural references==
Essex is portrayed by actor Charles Gray in the 1970 film &quot;Cromwell&quot;, inaccurately depicted sitting in the House of Commons in Cromwell&#x27;s presence, whereas in fact, Essex was already a member of the Lords before the Civil War.

<text>Year 438 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Tribunate of Mamercinus, Iullus and Cincinnatus (or, less frequently, year 316 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 438 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
==== Greece ====
* The Parthenon on the Acropolis at Athens is completed by Ictinus and Callicrates and is consecrated after 9 years of construction. It is dedicated at the Panathenaea (a festival held in honour of Athena every four years on the Acropolis).
* The colossal statue of the Athena Parthenos, which Phidias has made for the Parthenon, is completed and dedicated. It is made of gold and ivory and stands some 12 metres high.
* Telephus, a play by the renowned playwright Euripides, is produced in Athens. This tragedy did not survive to modern times.

==== Italy ====
* The city of Capua falls to the Samnites.

=== By topic ===
==== Literature ====
* The Greek playwright Euripides&#x27; play &quot;Alcestis&quot; is performed in the Dionysia, an Athenian dramatic festival.

==== Art ====
* Three seated Goddesses (possibly Hestia, Dione and Aphrodite), from the east pediment of the Parthenon, are made (finished in 432 BC). They are now kept at The British Museum in London.
* The Ionic frieze on the north side of the Parthenon, is created (finished in 432 BC). Parts of this frieze are now preserved in museums in Europe, including the &quot;Horsemen&quot; (at the British Museum, London), and the &quot;Marshals and Young Women&quot; (now at Musée du Louvre, Paris), which once formed part of the &quot;Procession&quot; on the frieze.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

<text>A tablet (also known as a pill) is a pharmaceutical oral dosage form (&quot;oral solid dosage&quot;, or OSD) or solid unit dosage form. Tablets may be defined as the solid unit dosage form of medication with suitable excipients. It comprises a mixture of active substances and excipients, usually in powder form, that are pressed or compacted into a solid dose. The main advantages of tablets are that they ensure a consistent dose of medicine that is easy to consume. 

Tablets are prepared either by moulding or by compression. The excipients can include diluents, binders or granulating agents, glidants (flow aids) and lubricants to ensure efficient tabletting; disintegrants to promote tablet break-up in the digestive tract; sweeteners or flavours to enhance taste; and pigments to make the tablets visually attractive or aid in visual identification of an unknown tablet. A polymer coating is often applied to make the tablet smoother and easier to swallow, to control the release rate of the active ingredient, to make it more resistant to the environment (extending its shelf life), or to enhance the tablet&#x27;s appearance. 

Medicinal tablets were originally made in the shape of a disk of whatever colour their components determined, but are now made in many shapes and colours to help distinguish different medicines. Tablets are often imprinted with symbols, letters, and numbers, which allow them to be identified, or a groove to allow splitting by hand. Sizes of tablets to be swallowed range from a few millimetres to about a centimetre.

The compressed tablet is the most commonly seen dosage form in use today. About two-thirds of all prescriptions are dispensed as solid dosage forms, and half of these are compressed tablets. A tablet can be formulated to deliver an accurate dosage to a specific site in the body; it is usually taken orally, but can be administered sublingually, buccally, rectally or intravaginally. The tablet is just one of the many forms that an oral drug can take such as syrups, elixirs, suspensions, and emulsions.

==History==
Pills are thought to date back to around 1500 BC. Earlier medical recipes, such as those from 4000 BC, were for liquid preparations rather than solids. The first references to pills were found on papyruses in ancient Egypt and contained bread dough, honey, or grease. Medicinal ingredients, such as plant powders or spices, were mixed in and formed by hand to make little balls, or pills.
In ancient Greece, such medicines were known as &quot;katapotia&quot; (&quot;something to be swallowed&quot;), and the Roman scholar Pliny, who lived from 23 to 79 AD, first gave a name to what we now call pills, calling them &quot;pilula&quot;.

Pills have always been difficult to swallow, and efforts have been made to make them go down easier. In mediaeval times, people coated pills with slippery plant substances. Another approach, used as recently as the 19th century, was to gild them in gold and silver, although this often meant that they would pass through the digestive tract with no effect. In the 1800s, sugar coating and gelatin coating were invented, as were gelatin capsules.

In 1843, the British painter and inventor William Brockedon was granted a patent for a machine capable of &quot;Shaping Pills, Lozenges, and Black Lead by Pressure in Dies&quot;. The device was capable of compressing powder into a tablet without the use of an adhesive.

==Types==

===Pills===

A pill was originally defined as a small, round, solid pharmaceutical oral dosage form of medication. reflects the historical concepts of grinding the ingredients with a mortar and pestle and rolling the resultant paste or dough into lumps to be dried. Today, in its strict sense, the word &quot;pill&quot; still refers specifically to tablets (including caplets) rather than capsules (which were invented much later), but because a simple hypernym is needed to intuitively cover all such oral dosage forms, the broad sense of the word &quot;pill&quot; is also widely used and includes both tablets and capsules — colloquially, any solid oral form of medication falls into the &quot;pill&quot; category (see &quot;&quot;).

An early example of a pill comes from ancient Rome. They were made of zinc carbonates, hydrozincite and smithsonite. The pills were used for sore eyes and were found aboard a Roman ship that wrecked in 140 BC. However, these tablets were meant to be pressed on the eyes, not swallowed.

; Defects/imperfections arising during tablet manufacturing
* Formulation related: sticking, picking, binding
* Processing: capping, lamination, cracking, chipping
* Machine: double impression

===Caplets===
A caplet is a smooth, coated, oval-shaped medicinal tablet in the general shape of a capsule. Many caplets have an indentation running down the middle, so they may be split in half more easily. Consumers have viewed capsules as the most effective way to take medication ever since they first appeared. For this reason, producers of drugs such as OTC analgesics wanting to emphasize the strength of their product developed the &quot;caplet&quot;, a portmanteau of &quot;capsule-shaped tablet&quot;, in order to tie this positive association to more efficiently produced tablet pills as well as being an easier-to-swallow shape than the usual disk-shaped tablet.

===Orally disintegrating tablets (ODT)===
An orally disintegrating tablet or orodispersible tablet (ODT), is a drug dosage form available for a limited range of over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medications.

==Tablet formulations==
In the tablet-pressing process, it is important that all ingredients be fairly dry, powdered or granular, somewhat uniform in particle size, and freely flowing. Mixed particle sized powders may separate during the manufacturing process due to differing particle densities. This can result in tablets with non-uniform concentrations of drug or active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), resulting in uneven dosage between tablets, but granulation should prevent this.

Some APIs may be compressed into tablets as pure substances, but this is rarely the case; most formulations include pharmacologically inactive ingredients (excipients):

* Usually a &quot;binder&quot; is added to help hold the tablet together and give it mechanical strength. A wide variety of binders may be used: some common ones are lactose, dibasic calcium phosphate, sucrose, corn (maize) starch, microcrystalline cellulose, povidone polyvinylpyrrolidone and modified cellulose (for example, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and hydroxyethylcellulose).
* Often, an ingredient is also needed to act as a &quot;disintegrator&quot; to aid tablet dispersion once swallowed, releasing the API for absorption. Some binders, such as starch and cellulose, are also excellent disintegrators.

==Tablet properties==
Tablets can be made in virtually any shape, although the requirements of patients and tableting machines mean that most are round, oval, or capsule-shaped. More unusual shapes have been manufactured, but patients find these harder to swallow, and they are more vulnerable to chipping or manufacturing problems.

Tablet diameter and shape are determined by the machine tooling used to produce them; a die plus an upper and a lower punch are required. This is called a station of tooling. The amount of tablet material and the placement of the punches in relation to one another during compression determine the thickness. Once this is done, we can measure the corresponding pressure applied during compression. The shorter the distance between the punches, the greater the pressure applied during compression, and sometimes the harder the tablet. Tablets need to be hard enough that they do not break up in the bottle, yet friable enough that they disintegrate in the gastric tract.

Tablets need to be strong enough to resist the stresses of packaging, shipping, and handling by the pharmacist and patient. The mechanical strength of tablets is assessed using a combination of simple failure and erosion tests, and more sophisticated engineering tests. The simpler tests are often used for quality control purposes, whereas the more complex tests are used during the design of the formulation and manufacturing process in the research and development phase. Standards for tablet properties are published in the various international pharmacopeias (USP/NF, EP, JP, etc.). The hardness of tablets is the principal measure of mechanical strength. Hardness is tested using a tablet hardness tester. The units for hardness have evolved since the 1930s but are commonly measured in kilograms per square centimetre. Models of testers include the Monsanto (or Stokes) Hardness Tester from 1930, the Pfizer Hardness Tester from 1950, the Strong Cob Hardness Tester and the Heberlain (or Schleeniger) Hardness Tester.

Lubricants prevent ingredients from clumping together and from sticking to the tablet punches or capsule filling machine. Lubricants also ensure that tablet formation and ejection can occur with low friction between the solid and die wall, as well as between granules, which helps in uniform filling of the die.

Common minerals like talc or silica, and fats, e.g. vegetable stearin, magnesium stearate or stearic acid are the most frequently used lubricants in tablets or hard gelatin capsules.

==Manufacturing==
===Manufacture of the tableting blend===
In the tablet pressing process, the appropriate amount of active ingredient must be in each tablet. Hence, all the ingredients should be well mixed. If a sufficiently homogenous mix of the components cannot be obtained with simple blending processes, the ingredients must be granulated prior to compression to assure an even distribution of the active compound in the final tablet. Two basic techniques are used to granulate powders for compression into tablets: wet granulation and dry granulation. Powders that can be mixed well do not require granulation and can be compressed into tablets through direct compression (&quot;DC&quot;). Direct compression is desirable as it is quicker. There is less processing, equipment, labor, and energy consumption. However, DC is difficult when a formulation has a high content of poorly compressible active ingredients.

===Wet granulation===
Wet granulation is a process of using a liquid binder to lightly agglomerate the powder mixture. The amount of liquid has to be properly controlled, as over-wetting will cause the granules to be too hard and under-wetting will cause them to be too soft and friable. Aqueous solutions have the advantage of being safer to deal with than solvent-based systems but may not be suitable for drugs which are degraded by hydrolysis.

; Procedure
# The active ingredient and excipients are weighed and mixed.
# The wet granulate is prepared by adding the liquid binder–adhesive to the powder blend and mixing thoroughly. Examples of binders/adhesives include aqueous preparations of cornstarch, natural gums such as acacia, cellulose derivatives such as methyl cellulose, gelatin, and povidone.
# Screening the damp mass through a mesh to form pellets or granules.
# Drying the granulation. A conventional tray-dryer or fluid-bed dryer are most commonly used.
# After the granules are dried, they are passed through a screen of smaller size than the one used for the wet mass to create granules of uniform size.

Low shear wet granulation processes use very simple mixing equipment, and can take a considerable time to achieve a uniformly mixed state. High shear wet granulation processes use equipment that mixes the powder and liquid at a very fast rate, and thus speeds up the manufacturing process. Fluid bed granulation is a multiple-step wet granulation process performed in the same vessel to pre-heat, granulate, and dry the powders. It is used because it allows close control of the granulation process.

===Dry granulation===
Dry granulation processes create granules by light compaction of the powder blend under low pressures. The compacts so-formed are broken up gently to produce granules (agglomerates). This process is often used when the product to be granulated is sensitive to moisture and heat. Dry granulation can be conducted on a tablet press using slugging tooling or on a roll press called a roller compactor. Dry granulation equipment offers a wide range of pressures to attain proper densification and granule formation. Dry granulation is simpler than wet granulation, therefore the cost is reduced. However, dry granulation often produces a higher percentage of fine granules, which can compromise the quality or create yield problems for the tablet. Dry granulation requires drugs or excipients with cohesive properties, and a &#x27;dry binder&#x27; may need to be added to the formulation to facilitate the formation of granules.

===Hot melt extrusion===
Hot melt extrusion is utilized in pharmaceutical solid oral dose processing to enable delivery of drugs with poor solubility and bioavailability. Hot melt extrusion has been shown to molecularly disperse poorly soluble drugs in a polymer carrier increasing dissolution rates and bioavailability. The process involves the application of heat, pressure and agitation to mix materials together and &#x27;extrude&#x27; them through a die. Twin-screw high shear extruders blend materials and simultaneously break up particles. The extruded particles can then be blended and compressed into tablets or filled into capsules.

===Granule lubrication===
After granulation, a final lubrication step is used to ensure that the tableting blend does not stick to the equipment during the tableting process. This usually involves low shear blending of the granules with a powdered lubricant, such as magnesium stearate or stearic acid.

===Manufacture of the tablets===
Whatever process is used to make the tableting blend, the process of making a tablet by powder compaction is very similar. First, the powder is filled into the die from above. The mass of powder is determined by the position of the lower punch in the die, the cross-sectional area of the die, and the powder density. At this stage, adjustments to the tablet weight are normally made by repositioning the lower punch. After die filling, the upper punch is lowered into the die and the powder is uniaxially compressed to a porosity of between 5 and 20%. The compression can take place in one or two stages (main compression, and, sometimes, pre-compression or tamping) and for commercial production occurs very fast (500–50 mg per tablet). Finally, the upper punch is pulled up and out of the die (decompression), and the tablet is ejected from the die by lifting the lower punch until its upper surface is flush with the top face of the die. This process is repeated for each tablet.

Common problems encountered during tablet manufacturing operations include:

* Fluctuations in tablet weight, usually caused by uneven powder flow into the die due to poor powder flow properties.
* Fluctuations in dosage of the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient, caused by uneven distribution of the API in the tableting blend (either due to poor mixing or separation in process).
* Sticking of the powder blend to the tablet tooling, due to inadequate lubrication, worn or dirty tooling, or a sticky powder formulation
* Capping, lamination or chipping. This is caused by air being compressed with the tablet formulation and then expanding when the punch is released: if this breaks the tablet apart, it can be due to incorrect machine settings, or due to incorrect formulation: either because the tablet formulation is too brittle or not adhesive enough, or because the powder being fed to the tablet press contains too much air (has too low bulk density).
* Capping can also occur due to high moisture content.

Consequently, permanent consistency checks are required during the manufacturing process.

===Tablet compaction simulator===
Tablet formulations are designed and tested using a laboratory machine called a Tablet Compaction Simulator or Powder Compaction Simulator. This is a computer controlled device that can measure the punch positions, punch pressures, friction forces, die wall pressures, and sometimes the tablet internal temperature during the compaction event. Numerous experiments with small quantities of different mixtures can be performed to optimise a formulation. Mathematically corrected punch motions can be programmed to simulate any type and model of production tablet press. Initial quantities of active pharmaceutical ingredients are very expensive to produce, and using a Compaction Simulator reduces the amount of powder required for product development.

===Tablet presses===

Tablet presses, also called tableting machines, range from small, inexpensive bench-top models that make one tablet at a time (single-station presses), with only around a half-ton pressure, to large, computerized, industrial models (multi-station rotary presses) that can make hundreds of thousands to millions of tablets an hour with much greater pressure. The tablet press is an essential piece of machinery for any pharmaceutical and nutraceutical manufacturer. Tablet presses must allow the operator to adjust the position of the lower and upper punches accurately, so that the tablet weight, thickness and density/hardness can each be controlled. This is achieved using a series of cams, rollers, or tracks that act on the tablet tooling (punches). Mechanical systems are also incorporated for die filling, and for ejecting and removing the tablets from the press after compression. Pharmaceutical tablet presses are required to be easy to clean and quick to reconfigure with different tooling, because they are usually used to manufacture many different products.
There are two main standards of tablet tooling used in pharmaceutical industry: American standard TSM and European standard EU. TSM and EU configurations are similar to each other but cannot be interchanged.

Modern tablet presses reach output volumes of up to 1,700,000 tablets per hour. These huge volumes require frequent in-process quality control for the tablet weight, thickness and hardness. Due to efforts to reduce rejects rates and machine down-time, automated tablet testing devices are used on-line with the tablet press or off-line in the IPC-labs.

===Tablet coating===
Many tablets today are coated after being pressed. Although sugar-coating was popular in the past, the process has many drawbacks. Modern tablet coatings are polymer and polysaccharide based, with plasticizers and pigments included. Tablet coatings must be stable and strong enough to survive the handling of the tablet, must not make tablets stick together during the coating process, and must follow the fine contours of embossed characters or logos on tablets. Coatings are necessary for tablets that have an unpleasant taste, and a smoother finish makes large tablets easier to swallow. Tablet coatings are also useful to extend the shelf-life of components that are sensitive to moisture or oxidation. Special coatings (for example with pearlescent effects) can enhance brand recognition.

If the active ingredient of a tablet is sensitive to acid, or is irritant to the stomach lining, an enteric coating can be used, which is resistant to stomach acid, and dissolves in the less acidic area of the intestines. Enteric coatings are also used for medicines that can be negatively affected by taking a long time to reach the small intestine, where they are absorbed. Coatings are often chosen to control the rate of dissolution of the drug in the gastrointestinal tract. Some drugs are absorbed better in certain parts of the digestive system. If this part is the stomach, a coating is selected that dissolves quickly and easily in acid. If the rate of absorption is best in the large intestine or colon, a coating is used that is acid resistant and dissolves slowly to ensure that the tablet reaches that point before dispersing. To measure the disintegration time of the tablet coating and the tablet core, automatic disintegration testers are used which are able to determine the complete disintegration process of a tablet by measuring the rest height of the thickness with every upward stroke of the disintegration tester basket.

There are two types of coating machines used in the pharmaceutical industry: coating pans and automatic coaters. Coating pans are used mostly to sugar coat pellets. Automatic coaters are used for all kinds of coatings; they can be equipped with a remote control panel, a dehumidifier, and dust collectors. An explosion-proof design is required for applying coatings that contain alcohol.

===Pill-splitters===
It is sometimes necessary to split tablets into halves or quarters. Tablets are easier to break accurately if scored, but there are devices called pill-splitters which cut unscored and scored tablets. Tablets with special coatings (for example, enteric coatings or controlled-release coatings) should not be broken before use, as this exposes the tablet core to the digestive juices, circumventing the intended delayed-release effect.

<doc id="78005" wikidata="Q2418785" url="?curid=78005" title="Belgarath the Sorcerer">
<text>Belgarath the Sorcerer is a fantasy novel by American writers David Eddings and Leigh Eddings. Set in the same universe as the Eddings&#x27; &quot;The Belgariad&quot; and &quot;The Malloreon&quot;, it is a prequel to the other series, although the framework story is set after the events of &quot;The Malloreon&quot;.

The novel begins shortly after the end of &quot;The Malloreon&quot; with Belgarion, with help from Durnik, pestering Belgarath to write an autobiographical account of the events prior to &quot;The Belgariad&quot;. The core of the book is in the form of Belgarath&#x27;s memoirs starting with his becoming an outcast from his village and becoming first disciple of the god Aldur and ending with the birth of Belgarion—a span of about seven thousand years.

&quot;Polgara the Sorceress&quot; is a companion book to &quot;Belgarath the Sorcerer&quot; which form the memoirs of Belgarath&#x27;s elder daughter, Polgara.</text><links>

<doc id="78006" wikidata="Q167457" url="?curid=78006" title="Treaty of Rome">
<text>The Treaty of Rome, or EEC Treaty (officially the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community), brought about the creation of the European Economic Community (EEC), the best known of the European Communities (EC). The treaty was signed on 25 March 1957 by Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany, and it came into force on 1 January 1958. Originally the &quot;Treaty establishing the European Economic Community&quot;, and now continuing under the name &quot;Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union&quot;, it remains one of the two most important treaties in what is now the European Union (EU).

The treaty proposed the progressive reduction of customs duties and the establishment of a customs union. It proposed to create a common market for goods, labour, services, and capital across member states. It also proposed the creation of a Common Agriculture Policy, a Common Transport Policy and a European Social Fund and established the European Commission.

The treaty has been amended on several occasions since 1957. The Maastricht Treaty of 1992 removed the word &quot;economic&quot; from the Treaty of Rome&#x27;s official title, and in 2009, the Treaty of Lisbon renamed it the &quot;Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union&quot;.

==History==
===Background===
In 1951, the Treaty of Paris was signed, creating the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). The Treaty of Paris was an international treaty based on international law, designed to help reconstruct the economies of the European continent, prevent war in Europe and ensure a lasting peace.
The original idea was conceived by Jean Monnet, a senior French civil servant and it was announced by Robert Schuman, the French Foreign Minister, in a declaration on 9 May 1950. The aim was to pool Franco-West German coal and steel production, because the two raw materials were the basis of the industry (including war industry) and power of the two countries. The proposed plan was that Franco-West German coal and steel production would be placed under a common High Authority within the framework of an organisation that would be open for participation to other European countries. The underlying political objective of the European Coal and Steel Community was to strengthen Franco-German cooperation and banish the possibility of war.

France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands began negotiating the treaty. The Treaty Establishing the ECSC was signed in Paris on 18 April 1951, and entered into force on 24 July 1952. The Treaty expired on 23 July 2002, after fifty years, as was foreseen. The common market opened on 10 February 1953 for coal, iron ore and scrap, and on 1 May 1953 for steel.

Partly in the aim of creating a United States of Europe, two further Communities were proposed, again by the French. A European Defence Community (EDC) and a European Political Community (EPC). While the treaty for the latter was being drawn up by the Common Assembly, the ECSC parliamentary chamber, the EDC was rejected by the French Parliament. President Jean Monnet, a leading figure behind the Communities, resigned from the High Authority in protest and began work on alternative Communities, based on economic integration rather than political integration.

As a result of the energy crises, the Common Assembly proposed extending the powers of the ECSC to cover other sources of energy. However, Monnet desired a separate Community to cover nuclear power, and Louis Armand was put in charge of a study into the prospects of nuclear energy use in Europe. The report concluded that further nuclear development was needed, in order to fill the deficit left by the exhaustion of coal deposits and to reduce dependence on oil producers. The Benelux states and West Germany were also keen on creating a general common market; however, this was opposed by France owing to its protectionist policy, and Monnet thought it too large and difficult a task. In the end, Monnet proposed creating both as separate Communities to attempt to satisfy all interests. As a result of the Messina Conference of 1955, Paul-Henri Spaak was appointed as chairman of a preparatory committee, the Spaak Committee, charged with the preparation of a report on the creation of a common European market. Both the Spaak report and the Treaty of Rome were drafted by Pierre Uri, a close collaborator of Monnet.

===Move towards a common market===
The Spaak Report drawn up by the &quot;Spaak Committee&quot; provided the basis for further progress and was accepted at the Venice Conference (29 and 30 May 1956) where the decision was taken to organise an Intergovernmental Conference. The report formed the cornerstone of the Intergovernmental Conference on the Common Market and Euratom at Val Duchesse in 1956.

The outcome of the conference was that the new Communities would share the Common Assembly (now the Parliamentary Assembly) with the ECSC, as they would the European Court of Justice. However, they would not share the ECSC&#x27;s Council or High Authority. The two new High Authorities would be called Commissions, from a reduction in their powers. France was reluctant to agree to more supranational powers; hence, the new Commissions would have only basic powers, and important decisions would have to be approved by the Council (of national Ministers), which now adopted majority voting. Euratom fostered co-operation in the nuclear field, at the time a very popular area, and the European Economic Community was to create a full customs union between members.

In 1965, France&#x27;s president Charles de Gaulle decided to recall French representatives from dealing with the Council of Ministers, greatly crippling the EEC&#x27;s operations. This was known as the &quot;Empty Chair Crisis.&quot; To resolve this, the members agreed to the Luxembourg Compromise, in which veto power was given to members of the EC on decisions. The countries of the European Community held a meeting in The Hague in 1969. At this summit, they collectively ordered an increase to the European Parliament&#x27;s budget while also committing towards a shift away from national economic policy to greater international policy. Following this agreement, two new European Structural Investment Funds were created, which were the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund. These focused on the reallocation of investment funds towards the development of the economies of the member states.
===Signing===

The conference led to the signing on 25 March 1957, of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community and the Euratom Treaty at the Palazzo dei Conservatori on Capitoline Hill in Rome. 25 March 1957 was also the Catholic feast day of the Annunciation of Mary. 

In March 2007, the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; radio programme reported that delays in printing the treaty meant that the document signed by the European leaders as the Treaty of Rome consisted of blank pages between its frontispiece and page for the signatures.

===Anniversary commemorations===
Major anniversaries of the signing of the Treaty of Rome have been commemorated in numerous ways.

====Commemorative coins====
Commemorative coins have been struck by numerous European countries, notably at the 30th and 50th anniversaries (1987 and 2007 respectively).

==== 2007 celebrations in Berlin ====
In 2007, celebrations culminated in Berlin with the Berlin declaration preparing the Lisbon Treaty.

==== 2017 celebrations in Rome ====
In 2017, Rome was the centre of multiple official and popular celebrations. Street demonstrations were largely in favour of European unity and integration, according to several news sources.

===Historical assessment===
According to the historian Tony Judt, the Treaty of Rome did not represent a fundamental turning point in the history of European integration:

<doc id="78011" wikidata="Q834849" url="?curid=78011" title="EDVAC">
<text>EDVAC (Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer) was one of the earliest electronic computers. It was built by Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. Along with ORDVAC, it was a successor to the ENIAC. Unlike ENIAC, it was binary rather than decimal, and was designed to be a stored-program computer. 

ENIAC inventors, John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert, proposed the EDVAC&#x27;s construction in August 1945. A contract to build the new computer was signed in April 1946 with an initial budget of US$100,000. EDVAC was delivered to the Ballistic Research Laboratory in 1949. The Ballistic Research Laboratory became a part of the US Army Research Laboratory in 1952.

Functionally, EDVAC was a binary serial computer with automatic addition, subtraction, multiplication, programmed division and automatic checking with an ultrasonic serial memory having a capacity of 1,024 44-bit words. EDVAC&#x27;s average addition time was 864 microseconds and its average multiplication time was 2,900 microseconds.

==Project and plan==

ENIAC inventors John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert proposed EDVAC&#x27;s construction in August 1944, and design work for EDVAC commenced before ENIAC was fully operational. The design would implement a number of important architectural and logical improvements conceived during the ENIAC&#x27;s construction and would incorporate a high-speed serial-access memory. Like the ENIAC, the EDVAC was built for the U.S. Army&#x27;s Ballistics Research Laboratory at the Aberdeen Proving Ground by the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Moore School of Electrical Engineering. Eckert and Mauchly and the other ENIAC designers were joined by John von Neumann in a consulting role; von Neumann summarized and discussed logical design developments in the 1945 &quot;First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC&quot;, written between February and June of that year. Later in September 1945, Eckert and Mauchly followed up with a progress report on automatic high-speed computing for the EDVAC.

In early 1946, months after the completion of ENIAC, the University of Pennsylvania adopted a new patent policy, which would have required Eckert and Mauchly to assign all their patents to the university if they stayed beyond spring of that year. Unable to reach an agreement with the university, the duo left the Moore School of Electrical Engineering in March 1946, along with many of the senior engineering staff. Simultaneously, the duo founded the Electronic Control Company (later renamed the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation) in Philadelphia. A contract to build the new computer was signed in April 1946 with an initial budget of US$100,000. Later in August of that year, during the last of the Moore School Lectures, the Moore School team members were proposing new technological designs for the computer and its stored program concept. The contract named the device the Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Calculator. The final cost of EDVAC, however, was similar to the ENIAC&#x27;s, at just under $500,000.

The Raytheon Company was a subcontractor on EDVAC machines.

==Technical description==
The EDVAC was a binary serial computer with automatic addition, subtraction, multiplication, programmed division and automatic checking with an ultrasonic serial memory capacity of 1,024 44-bit words, thus giving a memory, in modern terms, of 5.6 kilobytes.

Physically, the computer comprised the following components:
* a magnetic tape reader-recorder (Wilkes 1956:36 describes this as a wire recorder.)
* a control unit with an oscilloscope
* a dispatcher unit to receive instructions from the control and memory and direct them to other units
* a computational unit to perform arithmetic operations on a pair of numbers and send the result to memory after checking on a duplicate unit
* a timer
* a dual memory unit consisting of two sets of 64 mercury acoustic delay lines of eight words capacity on each line
* three temporary delay-line tanks each holding a single word

EDVAC&#x27;s average addition time was 864 microseconds (about 1,160 operations per second) and its average multiplication time was 2,900 microseconds (about 340 operations per second). Time for an operation depended on memory access time, which varied depending on the memory address and the current point in the serial memory&#x27;s recirculation cycle.

The computer had 5,937 vacuum tubes and 12,000 diodes, and consumed 56 kW of power. It covered 490 ft² (45.5 m2) of floor space and weighed . The full complement of operating personnel was thirty people per eight-hour shift.

EDVAC could also do floating-point arithmetic. It used 33 bits for the mantissa and one bit for its sign. It used 10 bits for the power of 2, including the sign bit.

For executable instructions, the 44-bit word was divided into four 10-bit addresses and four bits to encode the index of an operation. The first two addresses were to the numbers in memory being used in the operation, the third address was for the memory location to store the result, and the fourth address was the location of the next instruction to be executed. Only 12 of the possible 16 instructions were used.

==Impact on future computer design==
John Von Neumann&#x27;s famous EDVAC monograph, &quot;First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC&quot;, proposed the main enhancement to its design that embodied the principal &quot;stored-program&quot; concept that we now call the Von Neumann architecture. This was the storing of the program in the same memory as the data. The British computers EDSAC at Cambridge and the Manchester Baby were the first working computers that followed this design, and it has been followed by the great majority of computers made since. Having the program and data in different memories is now called the Harvard architecture to distinguish it.

==Installation and operation==
EDVAC was delivered to the Ballistics Research Laboratory in 1949. After a number of problems had been discovered and solved, the computer began operation in 1951 although only on a limited basis.

In 1952 (April/May), it was running over hours a day (period from 15 April to 31 May, used for 341 hours).

By 1957, EDVAC was running over 20 hours a day with error-free run time averaging 8 hours. EDVAC received a number of upgrades including punch-card I/O in 1954, extra memory in slower magnetic drum form in 1955, and a floating-point arithmetic unit in 1958.

EDVAC ran until 1962 when it was replaced by BRLESC.

<text>The Bristol Type 156 Beaufighter (often called the Beau) is a British multi-role aircraft developed during the Second World War by the Bristol Aeroplane Company. It was originally conceived as a heavy fighter variant of the Bristol Beaufort torpedo bomber. The Beaufighter proved to be an effective night fighter, which came into service with the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the Battle of Britain, its large size allowing it to carry heavy armament and early aircraft interception radar without major performance penalties.

The Beaufighter was used in many roles; receiving the nicknames &quot;Rockbeau&quot; for its use as a rocket-armed ground attack aircraft and &quot;Torbeau&quot; as a torpedo bomber against Axis shipping, in which it replaced the Beaufort. In later operations, it served mainly as a maritime strike/ground attack aircraft, RAF Coastal Command having operated the largest number of Beaufighters amongst all other commands at one point. The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) also made extensive use of the type as an anti-shipping aircraft, such as during the Battle of the Bismarck Sea.

The Beaufighter saw extensive service during the war with the RAF (59 squadrons), Fleet Air Arm (15 squadrons), RAAF (seven squadrons), Royal Canadian Air Force (four squadrons), United States Army Air Forces (four squadrons), Royal New Zealand Air Force (two squadrons), South African Air Force (two squadrons) and &quot;Polskie Siły Powietrzne&quot; (Polish Air Force; one squadron). Variants of the Beaufighter were manufactured in Australia by the Department of Aircraft Production (DAP); such aircraft are sometimes referred to by the name &quot;DAP Beaufighter&quot;.

==Development==

===Origins===

The concept of the Beaufighter has its origins in 1938. During the Munich Crisis, the Bristol Aeroplane Company recognised that the Royal Air Force (RAF) had an urgent need for a long-range fighter aircraft capable of carrying heavy payloads for maximum destruction. Evaluation of the Beaufort bomber concluded that it had great structural strength and stiffness in the wings, nacelles, undercarriage and tail, so that the aircraft could be readily developed further for the greater speed and manoeuvrability required by a fighter-class aircraft. The Bristol design team, led by Leslie Frise, commenced the development of a cannon-armed fighter derivative as a private venture. The prospective aircraft had to share the same jigs as the Beaufort so that production could easily be switched from one aircraft to the other.

As a torpedo bomber and aerial reconnaissance aircraft, the Beaufort had a modest performance. To achieve the fighter-like performance desired for the Beaufighter, Bristol suggested that they equip the aircraft with a pair of its new Hercules engines, capable of around 1,500 hp, in place of the 1,000 hp Bristol Taurus engines on the Beaufort. The Hercules was a considerably larger and more powerful engine which required larger propellers; to obtain adequate ground clearance, the engines were mounted centrally on the wing, as opposed to the underslung position on the Beaufort. In October 1938, the project, which received the internal name &quot;Type 156&quot;, was outlined. In March 1939, the &quot;Type 156&quot; was given the name &#x27;Beaufighter&#x27;.

During early development, Bristol had formalised multiple configurations for the prospective aircraft, including variations such as a proposed &quot;Type 157&quot; three-seat bomber outfitted with a dorsal gun turret with a pair of cannons, and what Bristol referred to as a &quot;sports model&quot;, with a thinner fuselage, the &quot;Type 158&quot;. Bristol proceeded to suggest their concept for a fighter development of the Beaufort to the Air Ministry. The timing of the suggestion happened to coincide with delays in the development and production of the Westland Whirlwind cannon-armed twin-engine fighter. While there was some scepticism that the aircraft was too big for a fighter, the proposal was given a warm reception by the Air Staff.

The Air Ministry produced draft Specification F.11/37 in response to Bristol&#x27;s suggestion for an &quot;interim&quot; aircraft, pending the proper introduction of the Whirlwind. On 16 November 1938, Bristol received formal authorisation to commence the detailed design phase of the project and to proceed with the construction of four prototypes. Amongst the design requirements, the aircraft had to be able to accommodate the Rolls-Royce Griffon engine as an alternative to the Hercules, and had to have maximum interchangeability between the two engines, which would feature removable installations.

Bristol began building an initial prototype by taking a partly-built Beaufort out of the production line, which sped progress; Bristol had promised series production in early 1940 on the basis of an order being placed in February 1939. Designers expected that maximum re-use of Beaufort components would speed the process, but the fuselage required more work than expected and had to be redesigned. Perhaps in anticipation of this, the Air Ministry had requested that Bristol investigate the prospects of a &quot;slim fuselage&quot; configuration. Since the &quot;Beaufort cannon fighter&quot; was a conversion of an existing design, development and production was expected to proceed more quickly than with a new one. Within six months the first F.11/37 prototype, &quot;R2052&quot;, had been completed. A total of 2,100 drawings were produced during the transition from Beaufort to the prototype Beaufighter; more than twice as many were made during later development, from the prototype to the production Beaufighter. Two weeks before the prototype&#x27;s first flight, an initial production contract for 300 aircraft under Specification F.11/37 was issued by the Air Ministry, ordering the type &quot;off the drawing board&quot;.

===Prototypes and refinement===
On 17 July 1939, &quot;R2052&quot;, the first, unarmed, prototype, conducted its maiden flight, a little more than eight months after development had formally started. The rapid pace of development was partly due to the re-use of many elements of the Beaufort design, and frequently identical components. &quot;R2052&quot; was initially operated by Bristol for testing while it was based at Filton Aerodrome. Early modifications to &quot;R2052&quot; included stiffening of the elevator control circuit, increased fin area and lengthening of the main oleo strut of the undercarriage to better accommodate weight increases and hard landings.

During the pre-delivery trials, the first prototype &quot;R2052&quot;, powered by a pair of two-speed supercharged Hercules I-IS engines, had achieved 335 mph (539 km/h) at 16,800 ft (5,120 m) in a clean configuration. The second prototype, &quot;R2053&quot;, which was furnished with Hercules I-M engines (similar to Hercules II) and was laden with operational equipment, had attained a lower speed of 309 mph at 15,000 ft. According to aviation author Philip Moyes, the performance of the second prototype was considered disappointing, particularly as the Hercules III engines of the initial production aircraft would likely provide little improvement, especially in light of additional operational equipment being installed; it was recognised that demand for the Hercules engine to power other aircraft such as the Short Stirling bomber posed a potential risk to the production rate of the Beaufighter. This sparked considerable interest in the adoption of alternative engines for the type.
Roy Fedden, chief designer of the Bristol engine division, was a keen advocate for the improved Hercules VI for the Beaufighter but it was soon passed over in favour of the rival Griffon engine, as the Hercules VI required extensive development. Due to production of the Griffon being reserved for the Fairey Firefly, the Air Ministry instead opted for the Rolls-Royce Merlin to power the Beaufighter until the manufacturing rate of the Hercules could be raised by a new shadow factory in Accrington. The standard Merlin XX-powered aircraft was later called the &quot;Beaufighter Mk.IIF&quot;; the planned slim-fuselage aircraft, alternatively equipped with Hercules IV and Griffon engines, the &quot;Beaufighter Mk.III&quot; and &quot;Beaufighter Mk.IV&quot; respectively, were not built.

In February 1940, an order was placed for three Beaufighters, converted to use the alternative Merlin engine. The Merlin engine installations and nacelles were designed by Rolls-Royce as a complete &quot;power egg&quot;; the design and approach of the Beaufighter&#x27;s Merlin installation was later incorporated into the design for the much larger four-engined Avro Lancaster bomber. Success with the Merlin-equipped aircraft was expected to lead to production aircraft in 1941. In June 1940, the first Merlin-powered aircraft conducted its first flight. In late 1940, the two Merlin-equipped prototypes (the third having been destroyed in a bombing raid) were delivered. Flight tests found that the Merlins left the aircraft underpowered, with a pronounced tendency to swing to port, making take-offs and landings difficult and causing a high accident rate – out of 337 Merlin-powered aircraft, 102 were lost to accidents.

On 2 April 1940, &quot;R2052&quot; was delivered to the RAF; it was followed by &quot;R2053&quot; two weeks later. On 27 July 1940, the first five production Beaufighters were delivered to the RAF along with another five on 3 August 1940. These production aircraft incorporated aerodynamic improvements, reducing aerodynamic drag from the engine nacelles and tail wheel; the oil coolers were also relocated on the leading edge of the wing. The armament of the Beaufighter had also undergone substantial changes, the initial 60-round capacity spring-loaded drum magazine arrangement being awkward and inconvenient; alternative systems were investigated by Bristol.

Bristol&#x27;s proposed recoil-operated ammunition feed system was rejected by officials, which led to a new system being devised and tested on the fourth prototype, &quot;R2055&quot;. The initial rejection was later reversed, upon the introduction of a new electrically driven feed derived from Châtellerault designs brought to Britain by Free French officers, which was quite similar to Bristol&#x27;s original proposal. The initial 50 production aircraft were approved for completion with a cannon-only armament. The design of the cannons and the armament configuration was revised on most aircraft. The addition of six .303 Browning machine guns made the Beaufighter the most heavily armed fighter aircraft in the world, capable of delivering a theoretical weight of fire of up to per minute; the practical rate of fire was much lower due to gun overheating and ammunition capacity.

Further armament trials and experimental modifications were performed throughout the Beaufighter&#x27;s operational life. By mid-1941, 20 Beaufighters were reserved for test purposes, including engine development, stability and manoeuvrability improvements and other purposes. In May 1941, the Beaufighter Mk.IIs &quot;R2274&quot; and &quot;R2306&quot; were modified to the &quot;Beaufighter Mk.III&quot; standard; removing the six wing guns and two inboard cannons to install a Boulton-Paul-built four-gun turret behind the pilot, to overcome the effect of recoil and nose-down tendency when firing the usual armament, was found to obstruct the emergency egress of the pilot. The fourth prototype, &quot;R2055&quot;, had its regular armament replaced by a pair of guns for attacking ground targets, a Vickers S gun mounted on the starboard fuselage and a Rolls-Royce BH gun mounted on the port fuselage; these trials also led to the Vickers gun being installed on an anti-tank Hawker Hurricane IID.

===Production===

Large orders for the Beaufighter were placed around the outbreak of the Second World War, including one for 918 aircraft shortly after the arrival of the initial production examples. In mid-1940, during an official visit to Bristol&#x27;s Filton facility by the Minister of Aircraft Production, Lord Beaverbrook, the minister spoke of the importance of the Beaufighter to the war effort and urged its rapid service entry. While the aircraft&#x27;s size had once caused scepticism, the Beaufighter became the highest performance aircraft capable of carrying the bulky early aircraft interception radars used for night fighter operations, without incurring substantial endurance or armament penalties, and was invaluable as a night fighter.

For the maximum rate of production, sub-contracting of the major components was used wherever possible and two large shadow factories to perform final assembly work on the Beaufighter were established via the Ministry of Aircraft Production; the first, operated by the Fairey Aviation Company, was at Stockport, Greater Manchester and the second shadow, run by Bristol, was at Weston-super-Mare, Somerset. Output of the Beaufighter rose rapidly upon the commencement of production.

Through 1940–41, the manufacturing rate of the Beaufighter steadily rose. On 7 December 1940, the 100th Filton-built aircraft was dispatched; the 200th Filton-built aircraft followed on 10 May 1941. On 7 March 1941, the first Fairey-built Beaufighter Mk.I performed its first test flight; the first Weston-built aircraft reached the same milestone on 20 February 1941. The volume of production involved, along with other factors, had led to a shortage of Hercules engines being expected, jeopardising the aircraft&#x27;s manufacturing rate. The next variant, the &quot;Beaufighter Mk.II&quot;, used the Merlin engine instead. On 22 March 1941, the first production Beaufighter Mk.II, &quot;R2270&quot;, conducted its maiden flight; squadron deliveries commenced in late April 1941.

By mid-1941, manufacture of the Beaufighter varied to meet the demands of RAF Fighter Command and RAF Coastal Command. Early aircraft were able to be outfitted and perform with either command but later, the roles and equipment diverged, leading to the production of distinct models, distinguished by the suffixes &quot;F&quot; for Fighter Command and &quot;C&quot; for Coastal Command. Often, one command opted for modifications and features that the other did not. This occurred with the bellows-type dive brake that became standard for Coastal Command Beaufighters for its usefulness in torpedo-bombing.

Production of the earlier Beaufort in Australia and the great success of British-made Beaufighters used by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), contributed to the Australian government deciding in January 1943 to manufacture Beaufighters under the Department of Aircraft Production (DAP) organisation at Fishermans Bend, Melbourne, Victoria from 1944. The DAP Beaufighter was an attack and torpedo bomber known as the &quot;Mk.21&quot;. Design changes included Hercules VII or XVIII engines and some minor changes in armament. By September 1945, when British production ended, 5,564 Beaufighters had been built by Bristol and the Fairey Aviation Company at Stockport and RAF Ringway (498); also by the Ministry of Aircraft Production (3336) and Rootes at Blythe Bridge (260). When Australian production ceased in 1946, 364 Mk.21s had been built.

==Design==

The Bristol Beaufighter is a fighter derivative of the Beaufort torpedo-bomber. It is a twin-engine two-seat long-range day and night fighter. The aircraft employed an all-metal monocoque construction, comprising three sections with extensive use of &#x27;Z-section&#x27; frames and &#x27;L-section&#x27; longeron. The wing of the Beaufighter used a mid-wing cantilever all-metal monoplane arrangement, also constructed out of three sections. Structurally, the wing consisted of two spars with single-sheet webs and extruding flanges, completed with a stressed-skin covering, and had metal-framed ailerons with fabric coverings along with hydraulically-actuated flaps located between the fuselage and the ailerons. Hydraulics were also used to retract the independent units of undercarriage, and the brakes were actuated pneumatically.
The twin Bristol Taurus engines of the Beaufort, having been deemed insufficiently powerful for a fighter, were replaced by more powerful two-speed supercharged Bristol Hercules radial engines. These powered three-bladed Rotol constant-speed propellers; both fully feathering metal and wooden blades were used. The extra power had presented vibration issues during development; in the final design, the engines were mounted on longer and more flexible struts, which extended from the front of the wings. This change moved the centre of gravity (CoG) forward, which was undesirable, so the CoG was moved back by shortening the nose, which was possible as the space within the nose had been occupied by a bomb aimer in the original Beaufort torpedo bomber, unnecessary in a fighter. The majority of the fuselage was positioned aft of the wing and, with the engine cowlings and propellers now further forward than the tip of the nose, gave the Beaufighter a characteristically stubby appearance.
In general, with the exception of the powerplants used, the differences between the preceding Beaufort and Beaufighter were minor. The wings, control surfaces, retractable landing gear and aft section of the fuselage were identical to those of the Beaufort, while the wing centre section was similar apart from certain fittings. The areas for the rear gunner and bomb-aimer were removed, leaving only the pilot in a fighter-type cockpit. The navigator-radar operator sat to the rear under a small Perspex bubble where the Beaufort&#x27;s dorsal turret had been. Each crew member had his own hatch in the floor of the aircraft. The front hatch was behind the pilot&#x27;s seat, whose back collapsed to allow the pilot to climb over and into the seat. In an emergency, the pilot could operate a lever that remotely released the hatch, grasp two steel overhead tubes and lift himself out of his seat, swing his legs over the open hatchway, then let go to drop through. Evacuating the aircraft was easier for the navigator, as the rear hatch was in front of him and without obstruction.

The Beaufighter&#x27;s armament was located in various positions on the lower fuselage and wings. The bomb bay of the Beaufort had been entirely omitted, but a small bomb load could be carried externally. A total of four forward-firing 20 mm Hispano Mk.I cannon were mounted in the lower fuselage area. These were fed from 60-round drums, requiring the radar operator to change the ammunition drums manually—an arduous and unpopular task, especially while chasing a bomber at night. They were soon replaced by Hispano Mk. II cannon featuring a belt-feed system. The cannons were supplemented by six .303 in (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns in the wings (four starboard, two port, the asymmetry caused by the port mounting of the landing light). This was one of the heavier, if not the heaviest, fighter armament of its time. When Beaufighters were developed as fighter-torpedo bombers, often with the machine guns removed, they used their firepower to suppress flak and hit enemy ships, especially escorts and small vessels. The recoil of the guns could reduce the speed of the aircraft by around 25 knots.

The Beaufighter was commonly operated as a night fighter, such as during the Battle of Britain. Mass production of the type came at almost exactly the same time as the first British aircraft interception radar sets were becoming available, a natural match for a night fighter. As the aircraft&#x27;s four 20 mm cannons were mounted in the lower fuselage, the vacant nose could accommodate the radar antennas needed, and while early aircraft interception equipment was too bulky to fit in single-engine fighters of the day, it could be accommodated in the Beaufighter&#x27;s spacious fuselage. At night the onboard radar enabled the aircraft to detect and locate enemy aircraft. The heavy fighter remained fast enough to catch up to slower German bombers and, with its heavy armament, deal out considerable damage to them. While early radar sets suffered from restrictions in range and thus initially limited the aircraft&#x27;s usefulness, improved radars became available in January 1941, making the Beaufighter one of the more effective night fighters of the era.

==Operational service==

===Introduction===

The Beaufighter Mk.I was heavier than one-man fighters, with an all-up weight of 16,000 lb (7,000 kg), and slower, with a maximum speed of 335 mph (540 km/h) at 16,800 ft (5,000 m). It was the only heavy fighter aircraft available, as the Westland Whirlwind had been cancelled due to production problems with its Rolls-Royce Peregrine engines. On 12 August 1940, the first production Beaufighter was delivered to RAF Tangmere for trials with the Fighter Interception Unit. On 2 September 1940, 25 Squadron, 29 Squadron, 219 Squadron, and 604 Squadron became the first operational squadrons to receive production aircraft, each squadron received one Beaufighter that day to begin converting from their Blenheim IF heavy fighters. The re-equipping and conversion training process took several months; on the night of 17/18 September 1940, Beaufighters of 29 Squadron conducted their first operational night patrol, conducting an uneventful sortie; the first operational daylight sortie was performed on the following day. On 25 October 1940, the first confirmed Beaufighter kill, a Dornier Do 17, was made.

Initial production deliveries of the Beaufighter lacked the radar for night-fighter operations; these were installed by No. 32 Maintenance Unit at RAF St Athan during late 1940. On the night of 19/20 November 1940, the first kill by a radar-equipped Beaufighter occurred, of a Junkers Ju 88. More advanced radar units were installed in early 1941, which soon allowed the Beaufighter to become an effective counter to the night raids of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. By March 1941, half of the 22 German aircraft claimed by British fighters were by Beaufighters. During a raid on London on the night of 19/20 May 1941, 24 aircraft were shot down by fighters, against two by ground anti-aircraft fire.

In late April 1941, the first two &quot;Beaufighter Mk.II&quot; aircraft, &quot;R2277&quot; and &quot;R2278&quot;, were delivered to 600 and 604 Squadrons; the former squadron was the first to receive the type in quantity in the following month. The Mk.II was also supplied to the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy. A night-fighter &quot;Beaufighter Mk.VIF&quot; was supplied to squadrons in March 1942, equipped with AI Mark VIII radar. The Beaufighter showed its merits as a night fighter, and also performed in other capacities. As the faster de Havilland Mosquito took over as the main night fighter in mid-to-late 1942, the heavier Beaufighter made valuable contributions in other areas such as anti-shipping, ground attack and long-range interdiction, in every major theatre of operations.
On 12 June 1942, a Beaufighter conducted a raid which Moyes said was &quot;perhaps the most impudent of the war&quot;. &quot;T4800&quot;, a Beaufighter Mk.1C of No. 236 Squadron, flew from Thorney Island to occupied Paris at an extremely low altitude in daylight to drop a French tricolor flag on the Arc de Triomphe and strafe the Gestapo headquarters in the Place de la Concorde.

The Beaufighter soon commenced service overseas, where its ruggedness and reliability quickly made the aircraft popular with crews. However, it was heavy on the controls and not easy to fly, with landing being a particular challenge for inexperienced pilots. Due to wartime shortages, some Beaufighters entered operational service without feathering equipment for their propellers. As some models of the twin-engined Beaufighter could not stay aloft on one engine unless the dead propeller was feathered, this deficiency contributed to several operational losses and the deaths of aircrew.

In the Mediterranean, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) 414th, 415th, 416th and 417th night fighter squadrons received a hundred Beaufighters in the summer of 1943, achieving their first victory in July 1943. Through the summer, the squadrons conducted daytime convoy escort and ground-attack operations but primarily flew as night fighters. Although the Northrop P-61 Black Widow fighter began to arrive in December 1944, USAAF Beaufighters continued to fly night operations in Italy and France until late in the war. By the autumn of 1943, the Mosquito was available in enough numbers to replace the Beaufighter as the primary RAF night fighter. By the end of the war some 70 pilots serving with RAF units had become aces while flying Beaufighters. At least one captured Beaufighter was operated by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; – there is a photograph of the aircraft in flight with German markings.

===Coastal Command===

It was recognised that RAF Coastal Command required a long-range heavy fighter aircraft such as the Beaufighter, and in early 1941 Bristol proceeded with the development of the &quot;Beaufighter Mk.IC&quot; long-range fighter. Based on the standard Mk.I model, the initial batch of 97 Coastal Command Beaufighters were hastily manufactured, making it impossible to incorporate the intended additional wing fuel tanks on the production line; 50-gallon tanks from the Vickers Wellington were temporarily installed on the floor between the cannon bays. In April/May 1941, this new variant of the Beaufighter entered squadron service in a detachment from 252 Squadron operating from Malta. This inaugural deployment with the squadron proved to be highly successful, leading to the type being retained in that theatre throughout the remainder of the war. In June 1941, the Beaufighter-equipped 272 Squadron based on Malta claimed the destruction of 49 enemy aircraft and the damaging of 42 more. The Beaufighter was reputedly very effective in the Mediterranean against Axis shipping, aircraft and ground targets; Coastal Command was, at one point, the majority user of the Beaufighter, replacing its inventory of obsolete Beaufort and Blenheim aircraft. To meet demand, both the Fairey and Weston production lines were, at times, only producing Coastal Command Beaufighters.
In 1941, to intensify offensive air operations against Germany and deter the deployment of &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; forces onto the Eastern Front, Coastal Command Beaufighters began offensive operations over France and Belgium, attacking enemy shipping in European waters. In December 1941, Beaufighters participated in Operation Archery, providing suppressing fire while British Commandos landed on the occupied Norwegian island of Vågsøy. In 1942, long range patrols of the Bay of Biscay were routinely conducted by Beaufighters, intercepting aircraft such as the Ju-88 and Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor operating against Allied anti-submarine patrols. Beaufighters also cooperated with the British Eighth Army during action in the Western Desert Campaign, often by ground strafing.

In mid-1942, Coastal Command began to take delivery of the improved &quot;Beaufighter Mk.VIC&quot;. By the end of 1942, Mk.VICs were being equipped with external torpedo-carrying gear for the British 18 in (450 mm) or the US 22.5 in (572 mm) torpedo; navigators were not happy about carrying the torpedo, as they were unable to use the escape hatch until after the torpedo had been dropped. In April 1943, the first successful torpedo attacks by Beaufighters was performed by 254 Squadron, sinking two merchant ships off Norway.
The Hercules Mk.XVII engine, developing 1,735 hp (1,294 kW) at 500 ft (150 m), was installed in the Mk.VIC airframe to produce the TF Mk.X (torpedo fighter), commonly known as the &quot;Torbeau&quot;. The Mk.X became the main production mark of the Beaufighter. The strike variant of the Torbeau was called the Mk.XIC. Beaufighter TF Xs could make precision attacks on shipping at wave-top height with torpedoes or RP-3 (60 lb) rockets. Early models of the Mk.X carried centimetric-wavelength ASV (air-to-surface vessel) radar with &quot;herringbone&quot; antennae on the nose and outer wings, but this was replaced in late 1943 by the centimetric AI Mk.VIII radar housed in a &quot;thimble-nose&quot; radome, enabling all-weather and night attacks.

The North Coates Strike Wing of Coastal Command, based at RAF North Coates on the Lincolnshire coast, developed tactics that combined large formations of Beaufighters, using cannons and rockets, to suppress flak, while the Torbeaus attacked at low level with torpedoes. These tactics were put into practice in mid-1943, and in ten months 29,762 tons (84,226 m3) of shipping were sunk. Tactics were further refined when shipping was moved from port during the night. The North Coates Strike Wing operated as the largest anti-shipping force of the Second World War, and accounted for over 150,000 tons (424,500 m3) of shipping and 117 vessels, most of which were small fishing and coastal vessels, for a loss of 120 Beaufighters and 241 aircrew killed or missing. This was half the total tonnage sunk by all strike wings between 1942 and 1945.

===Pacific War===

The Beaufighter arrived at squadrons in Asia and the Pacific in mid-1942. A British journalist said that Japanese soldiers called it the &quot;whispering death&quot; for its quiet engines, although this is not supported by Japanese sources. The Beaufighter&#x27;s Hercules engines used sleeve valves, which lacked the noisy valve gear common to poppet valve engines. This was most apparent in a reduced noise level at the front of the engine.

In the South-East Asian Theatre, the Beaufighter Mk.VIF operated from India as a night fighter and on operations against Japanese lines of communication in Burma and Thailand. Mk.X Beaufighters were also flown on long range daylight intruder missions over Burma. The high-speed, low-level attacks were very effective, despite often atrocious weather conditions and makeshift repair and maintenance facilities.

====Southwest Pacific====

The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) was a keen operator of the Beaufighter during the Second World War. On 20 April 1942, the RAAF&#x27;s first &quot;Beaufighter IC&quot; (an Australian designation given to various models of the aircraft, including &quot;Beaufighter VIC&quot;, &quot;Beaufighter X&quot;, and &quot;Beaufighter XIC&quot;), which had been imported from Britain, was delivered; the last aircraft was delivered on 20 August 1945. Initial RAAF deliveries were directed to No. 30 Squadron in New Guinea and No. 31 Squadron in North-West Australia.

Before DAP Beaufighters arrived at RAAF units in the South West Pacific Theatre, the Beaufighter Mk.IC was commonly employed in anti-shipping missions. The most famous of these was the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, during which Beaufighters were used in a fire-suppression role in a mixed force with USAAF Douglas A-20 Boston and North American B-25 Mitchell bombers. Earlier in the battle, eight Beauforts from No. 100 Squadron RAAF at Milne Bay had unsuccessfully attacked the Japanese troop convoy with torpedoes and scored no hits. Thirteen Beaufighters of No. 30 Squadron flew in at mast height to provide heavy suppressive fire for the waves of attacking bombers. The Japanese convoy, under the impression that they were under attack by Beaufort torpedo bombers, made the tactical error of turning their ships towards the aircraft to avoid presenting their sides to attack, which allowed the Beaufighters to inflict severe damage on the ships&#x27; anti-aircraft guns, bridges and crews with strafing runs along the length of the ships with their four 20 mm nose cannons and six wing-mounted .303 in (7.7 mm) machine guns. The Japanese ships were left exposed to mast-height bombing and skip bombing attacks by the US medium bombers. Eight transports and four destroyers were sunk for the loss of five aircraft, including one Beaufighter.

The role of the Beaufighters during the Battle of the Bismarck Sea was recorded by war correspondent and film-maker Damien Parer, who had flown during the engagement standing behind the pilot of one of the No. 30 Squadron aircraft; the engagement led to the Beaufighter becoming one of the more well-known aircraft in Australian service during the conflict. On 2 November 1943, in another high-profile event Beaufighter &quot;A19-54&quot; won the second of two unofficial races against an A-20 Boston bomber.

===Postwar===

From late 1944, RAF Beaufighter units were engaged in the Greek Civil War, finally withdrawing in 1946 From August 1948, Beaufighters were used during the Malayan Emergency, carrying out air strikes against communist forces. Initially this was done by a detachment from 84 Squadron but they were later replaced by all of 45 Squadron. In December 1949, 45 Squadron&#x27;s Beaufighters were replaced with the Bristol Type 164 Brigand, which had been designed using components of the Beaufighter&#x27;s failed stablemate, the Bristol Buckingham.

The Beaufighter was also used by the air forces of Portugal, Turkey and the Dominican Republic. It was used briefly by the Israeli Air Force after some ex-RAF examples were clandestinely purchased in 1948.

Many Mk.10 aircraft were converted to the target tug role postwar as the TT.10 and served with several RAF support units until 1960. The last flight of a Beaufighter in RAF service was by TT.10 &quot;RD761&quot; from RAF Seletar on 12 May 1960.

==Variants==
;Beaufighter Mk.IF: Two-seat night fighter variant equipped with AI Mark IV radar and Hercules XI engines

;Beaufighter Mk.IC: The &quot;C&quot; stood for Coastal Command variant; many were modified to carry bombs

;Beaufighter Mk.IIF: However well the Beaufighter performed, by late 1941 the Short Stirling bomber programme had a higher priority for the Hercules engine, and the Rolls-Royce Merlin XX-powered Mk.IIF night fighter was the result.

;Beaufighter Mk.III/IV:
:The Mk.III and Mk.IV were to be Hercules and Merlin powered Beaufighters with a new, slimmer fuselage, carrying an armament of six cannon and six machine guns that improved performance. The necessary costs of the changes to the production line led to the curtailing of the marks.

;Beaufighter Mk.V: The Mk.V had a Boulton Paul turret with four 0.303 in (7.7 mm) machine guns mounted aft of the cockpit supplanting one pair of cannon and the wing-mounted machine guns. Only two (Merlin-engined) Mk.Vs were built. When tested by the A&amp;AEE, &quot;R2274&quot; was capable of at .

;Beaufighter Mk.VI: The Hercules-powered Mk.VI was the next major version appearing in 1942 and over 1,000 examples were built. Changes included a dihedral tailplane.

;Beaufighter Mk.VIC: Coastal Command version, similar to the Mk.IC

;Beaufighter Mk.VIF: Night fighter equipped with AI Mark VIII radar

;Beaufighter Mk.VI (ITF): Interim torpedo fighter version

;Beaufighter Mk.VII: Proposed Australian-built variant with Hercules 26 engines, not built

;Beaufighter Mk.VIII: Proposed Australian-built variant with Hercules XVII engines, not built

;Beaufighter Mk.IX: proposed Australian-built variant with Hercules XVII engines, not built

;Beaufighter TF Mk.X: Two-seat torpedo fighter aircraft, dubbed the &quot;Torbeau&quot;. Hercules XVII engines with cropped superchargers improved low-altitude performance. The last major version (2,231 built) was the Mk.X. The later production models featured a dorsal tailfin extension.

;Beaufighter Mk.XIC: Coastal Command version of the Mk.X, with no torpedo gear

;Beaufighter Mk.XII: Proposed long-range variant of the Mk.XI with drop tanks, not built

;Beaufighter Mk.21: The Australian-made DAP Beaufighter. Changes included Hercules XVII engines, four 20 mm cannon in the nose, four Browning .50 in (12.7 mm) in the wings and the capacity to carry eight 5 in (130 mm) High Velocity Aircraft Rockets, two 250 lb (110 kg) bombs, two 500 lb (230 kg) bombs and one Mark 13 torpedo.
;Beaufighter TT Mk.10: After the war, many RAF Beaufighters were converted into target tug aircraft

;United Kingdom
* Beaufighter TF.X, &quot;RD253&quot; – Displayed at the Royal Air Force Museum in London, this aircraft flew with the Portuguese Air Force as &quot;BF-13&quot; in the late 1940s. It was used as an instructional airframe before its return to the UK in 1965. Restoration was completed in 1968, using components scavenged from a wide variety of sources, including some parts recovered from a crash site.
* Beaufighter TF.X &quot;RD220&quot; – This aircraft is currently displayed while under restoration at the National Museum of Flight at East Fortune Airfield, east of Edinburgh. Post-war, it served with the Portuguese naval air arm. After passing through the hands of the Portuguese &quot;Museu do Ar&quot; and the South African Air Force Museum, it was acquired by National Museums Scotland in 2000.
;United States
* Beaufighter Mk.Ic &quot;A19-43&quot; – On public display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force, Dayton, Ohio, since October 2006. Although flown in combat in the south-west Pacific by 31 Squadron Royal Australian Air Force, &quot;A19-43&quot; is painted as &quot;T5049&quot;, &quot;Night Mare&quot;, a USAAF Beaufighter flown by Capt. Harold Augspurger, commander of the 415th Night Fighter Squadron, who shot down a Heinkel He 111 carrying German staff officers in September 1944. The Beaufighter was recovered from a dump at Nhill, Australia, in 1971, where it had been abandoned in 1947. It was acquired by the USAF Museum in 1988.

===Under restoration or stored===

* Beaufighter Mk.Ic &quot;A19-144&quot; – Owned by The Fighter Collection at the Imperial War Museum Duxford, this aircraft has been undergoing a lengthy restoration to flying status for many years. It is a composite aircraft built using parts from &quot;JM135/A19-144&quot; and &quot;JL946/A19-148&quot;.
* Beaufighter Mk.IF &quot;X7688&quot; – Owned by the Historical Aircraft Restoration Society (HARS) in Australia, this aircraft is being restored to fly. It will be a composite airframe based on X7688 (forward fuselage and center-section), with parts from other aircraft.
* Beaufighter TF.X &quot;RD867&quot; – In storage at the Canada Aviation Museum, &quot;RD867&quot; awaits restoration. It is a semi-complete RAF restoration but lacks engines, cowlings or internal components. It was received from the RAF Museum in exchange for a Bristol Bolingbroke in 1969.

===Known wrecks===
A number of sunken aircraft are known; in 2005, the wreck of a Beaufighter (probably a Mk.IC flown by Sgt Donald Frazie and navigator Sgt Sandery of No. 272 Squadron RAF) was identified about off the north coast of Malta. The aircraft ditched in March 1943, after an engine failure occurred soon after take-off and lies inverted on the sea bed, in of water.

Another Mediterranean wreck lies in of water near the Greek island of Paros. This is possibly Beaufighter TF.X &quot;LX998&quot; of 603 Squadron, which was shot down after destroying a German Arado Ar 196 during an anti-shipping mission in November 1943. The Australian crew survived and were rescued by a British submarine.

A Mk.VIC Beaufighter, serial A19-130, lies in of water, just off the coast of Fergusson Island in the western Pacific. It was lost in almost identical circumstances to the Malta aircraft – it ditched in August 1943 after an engine failure soon after takeoff. The aircraft sank within seconds, but both crew and their passenger escaped and swam to shore. The wreck was located in 2000.

A Beaufighter lies at a depth of around 30 metres in the Høydalsfjorden in Norway. This aircraft was shot-down on 7 February 1945, during a strike against German shipping that resulted in a dogfight with German aircraft with heavy losses, known as Black Friday. The wreck has become a dive site for recreational divers.

In May 2020, the wreck of a Beaufighter TF.X, believed to be &quot;JM333&quot; of No. 254 Squadron, was uncovered by shifting sands on Cleethorpes beach near Grimsby. The aircraft was ditched on 21 April 1944 after suffering a double engine failure shortly after takeoff from North Coates. The crew survived uninjured.

<text>Bryn Mawr (, from Welsh for &#x27;big hill&#x27;) is a census-designated place (CDP) located in Pennsylvania, United States. It is located just west of Philadelphia along Lancaster Avenue, also known as U.S. Route 30. , the CDP is defined to include sections of Lower Merion Township, Montgomery County, as well as portions of Haverford Township and Radnor Township in Delaware County.

Bryn Mawr is located toward the center of what is known as the Main Line, a group of affluent Philadelphia suburban villages stretching from the city limits to Malvern. They became home to sprawling country estates belonging to Philadelphia&#x27;s wealthiest families during the Gilded Age, and over the decades became a bastion of old money. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 5,879. Bryn Mawr is home to Bryn Mawr College, and contains a sizable amount of student rentals, with roughly half of the community&#x27;s population aged 18–24.

==History==

Bryn Mawr is named after an estate near Dolgellau in Wales that belonged to Rowland Ellis, a Welsh Quaker who emigrated in 1686 to Pennsylvania to escape religious persecution.

Until the construction of the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s Main Line in 1869, the town, located in the old Welsh Tract, was known as Humphreysville, named for early settlers of the Humphreys family. The town was renamed by railroad agent William H. Wilson after he acquired on behalf of the railroad the that now compose Bryn Mawr.

To encourage visitors the railroad constructed the Bryn Mawr Hotel adjacent to the new station, which opened in 1872. After a fire destroyed the original building, a distinctive new hotel designed by architect Frank Furness was built in 1889. The second hotel building is currently occupied by The Baldwin School and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.

Bryn Mawr College was founded in 1885 originally as a Quaker institution but by 1893, it had become non-denominational.

In 1893, the first hospital, Bryn Mawr Hospital, was built on the Main Line by Dr. George Gerhard. Glenays, a historic home dating to 1859, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.

In the 1990 U.S. Census, the 2000 U.S. Census, and the 2010 U.S. Census, the CDP was located entirely in Lower Merion Township, Montgomery County.

However, the Bryn Mawr ZIP Code of 19010 covers a larger area. As a result, the geographic term Bryn Mawr is often used in a sense that includes not only the CDP, but also other areas that share the ZIP Code. These other areas include the community of Rosemont within Lower Merion Township and Radnor Township, and various other areas within Lower Merion Township, Radnor Township, and Haverford Township. Bryn Mawr is a part of the Philadelphia Main Line, a string of picturesque towns located along a railroad that connects Philadelphia with points west.

<doc id="78016" wikidata="Q1165753" url="?curid=78016" title="From Russia, with Love (novel)">
<text>From Russia, with Love is the fifth novel by the English author Ian Fleming to feature his fictional British Secret Service agent James Bond. Fleming wrote the story in early 1956 at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica; at the time he thought it might be his final Bond book. The novel was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape on 8 April 1957.

The story centres on a plot by SMERSH, the Soviet counter-intelligence agency, to assassinate Bond in such a way as to discredit both him and his organisation. As bait, the Russians use a beautiful cipher clerk Tatiana Romanova and the Spektor, a Soviet decoding machine. Much of the action takes place in Istanbul and on the Orient Express. The book was inspired by Fleming&#x27;s visit to Turkey on behalf of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; to report on an Interpol conference; he returned to Britain by the Orient Express. &quot;From Russia, with Love&quot; deals with the East–West tensions of the Cold War, and the decline of British power and influence in the post-Second World War era.

&quot;From Russia, with Love&quot; received broadly positive reviews at the time of publication. The book&#x27;s sales were boosted by an advertising campaign that played upon a visit by the British Prime Minister Anthony Eden to the Goldeneye estate, and the publication of an article in &quot;Life&quot;, which listed &quot;From Russia, with Love&quot; as one of US President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s ten favourite books. The story was serialised in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; newspaper, first in an abridged, multi-part form and then as a comic strip. In 1963 it was adapted into the second film in the Bond series, starring Sean Connery.

==Plot==
SMERSH, the Soviet counterintelligence agency, plans to commit a grand act of terrorism in the intelligence field. For this, it targets the British secret service agent James Bond. Due in part to his role in the defeat of the SMERSH agents Le Chiffre, Mr Big and Hugo Drax, Bond has been listed as an enemy of the Soviet state and a &quot;death warrant&quot; is issued for him. His death is planned to precipitate a major sex scandal, which will run in the world press for months and leave his and his service&#x27;s reputations in tatters. Bond&#x27;s killer is to be the SMERSH executioner Donovan &quot;Red&quot; Grant, a British Army deserter and psychopath whose homicidal urges coincide with the full moon. Kronsteen, SMERSH&#x27;s chess-playing master planner, and Colonel Rosa Klebb, the head of Operations and Executions, devise the operation. They instruct an attractive young cipher clerk, Corporal Tatiana Romanova, to tell the British that she wants to defect from her post in Istanbul and claim to have fallen in love with Bond after seeing a photograph of him. As an added lure, Romanova will provide the British with a Spektor, a Russian decoding device much coveted by MI6. She is not told the details or purpose of the plan.
The offer of defection, ostensibly from Romanova, is received by MI6 in London, but is conditional on Bond collecting her and the Spektor from Istanbul. MI6 is unsure of Romanova&#x27;s motives, but the prize of the Spektor is too tempting to ignore; Bond&#x27;s superior, M, orders him to go to Turkey. Once there, Bond forms a comradeship with Darko Kerim, head of the British service&#x27;s station in Turkey. Bond meets Romanova and they plan their route out of Turkey with the Spektor. He and Kerim believe her story and the three board the Orient Express. Kerim quickly discovers three Russian MGB agents on board, travelling incognito. He uses bribes and trickery to have two of them taken off the train, but he is later found dead in his compartment with the body of the third MGB agent.

At Trieste a man introduces himself as Captain Nash, a fellow MI6 agent, and Bond presumes he has been sent by M as added protection for the rest of the trip. Romanova is suspicious of Nash, but Bond reassures her that the man is from his own service. After dinner, at which Nash has drugged Romanova, they rest. Nash later wakes Bond, holding him at gunpoint, and reveals himself as the killer Grant. Instead of killing Bond immediately, he describes SMERSH&#x27;s plan. He is to shoot both of them, throw Romanova&#x27;s body out the window, and plant a film of their love-making in her luggage; in addition, the Spektor is booby-trapped to explode when examined. As Grant talks, Bond places his metal cigarette case between the pages of a book he holds in front of him, positioning it in front of his heart to stop the bullet. After Grant fires, Bond collapses to the floor and, when Grant steps over him, he attacks and kills the assassin. Bond and Romanova escape.

Later, in Paris, after successfully delivering Romanova and the booby-trapped Spektor to his superiors, Bond meets Rosa Klebb. She is captured but manages to kick Bond with a poisoned blade concealed in her shoe; the story ends with Bond fighting for breath and falling to the floor.

==Background and writing history==
By January 1956 the author Ian Fleming had published three novels—&quot;Casino Royale&quot; in 1953, &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; in 1954 and &quot;Moonraker&quot; in 1955. A fourth, &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;, was being edited and prepared for production. That month Fleming travelled to his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica to write &quot;From Russia, with Love&quot;. He followed his usual practice, which he later outlined in &quot;Books and Bookmen&quot; magazine: &quot;I write for about three hours in the morning ... and I do another hour&#x27;s work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go back to see what I have written ... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day.&quot; He returned to London in March that year with a 228-page first-draft manuscript that he subsequently altered more heavily than any of his other works. One of the significant re-writes changed Bond&#x27;s fate; Fleming had become disenchanted with his books and wrote to his friend, the American author Raymond Chandler: &quot;My muse is in a very bad way ... I am getting fed up with Bond and it has been very difficult to make him go through his tawdry tricks.&quot; Fleming re-wrote the end of the novel in April 1956 to make Klebb poison Bond, which allowed him to finish the series with the death of the character if he wanted.

Breathing became difficult. Bond sighed to the depth of his lungs. He clenched his jaws and half closed his eyes, as people do when they want to hide their drunkenness. ... He prised his eyes open. ... Now he had to gasp for breath. Again his hand moved up towards his cold face. He had an impression of Mathis starting towards him. Bond felt his knees begin to buckle ... [he] pivoted slowly on his heel and crashed head-long to the wine-red floor.
&quot;From Russia, with Love&quot;, novel&#x27;s closing lines

Fleming&#x27;s first draft ended with Bond and Romanova enjoying a romance. By January 1957 Fleming had decided he would write another story, and began work on &quot;Dr. No&quot; in which Bond recovers from his poisoning and is sent to Jamaica.

Fleming&#x27;s trip to Istanbul in June 1955 to cover an Interpol conference for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; was a source of much of the background information in the story. While there he met the Oxford-educated ship owner Nazim Kalkavan, who became the model for Darko Kerim; Fleming took down many of Kalkavan&#x27;s conversations in a notebook, and used them verbatim in the novel.

Although Fleming did not date the event within his novels, John Griswold and Henry Chancellor—both of whom wrote books for Ian Fleming Publications—have identified different timelines based on events and situations within the novel series as a whole. Chancellor put the events of &quot;From Russia, with Love&quot; in 1955; Griswold considers the story to have taken place between June and August 1954. In the novel, General Grubozaboyschikob of the MGB refers to the Istanbul pogrom, the Cyprus Emergency, and the &quot;revolution in Morocco&quot;—a reference to demonstrations in Morocco that forced France to grant independence in November 1955—as recent events. 

In August 1956, for fifty guineas, Fleming commissioned Richard Chopping to provide the art for the cover, based on Fleming&#x27;s design; the result won a number of prizes. After &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; had been published in March 1956, Fleming received a letter from a thirty-one-year-old Bond enthusiast and gun expert, Geoffrey Boothroyd, criticising the author&#x27;s choice of firearm for Bond.

I wish to point out that a man in James Bond&#x27;s position would never consider using a .25 Beretta. It&#x27;s really a lady&#x27;s gun—and not a very nice lady at that! Dare I suggest that Bond should be armed with a .38 or a nine millimetre—let&#x27;s say a German Walther PPK? That&#x27;s far more appropriate.

Boothroyd&#x27;s suggestions came too late to be included in &quot;From Russia, with Love&quot;, but one of the guns—a .38 Smith &amp; Wesson snubnosed revolver modified with one third of the trigger guard removed—was used as the model for Chopping&#x27;s image. Fleming later thanked Boothroyd by naming the armourer in &quot;Dr. No&quot; Major Boothroyd.

==Development==

===Plot inspirations===
As with several of his works, Fleming appropriated the names or backgrounds of people he knew or had heard of for the story&#x27;s characters: Red Grant, a Jamaican river guide—whom Fleming&#x27;s biographer Andrew Lycett described as &quot;a cheerful, voluble giant of villainous aspect&quot;—was used for the half-German, half-Irish assassin. Rosa Klebb was partly based on Colonel Rybkina, a real-life member of the Lenin Military-Political Academy about whom Fleming had written an article for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. The Spektor machine used as the bait for Bond was not a Cold War device, but had its roots in the Second World War Enigma machine, which Fleming had tried to obtain while serving in the Naval Intelligence Division.

The idea of the Orient Express came from two sources: Fleming had returned from the Istanbul conference in 1955 by the train, but found the experience drab, partly because the restaurant car was closed. He also knew of the story of Eugene Karp and his journey on the Orient Express: Karp was a US naval attaché and intelligence agent based in Budapest who, in February 1950, took the Orient Express from Budapest to Paris, carrying a number of papers about blown US spy networks in the Eastern Bloc. Soviet assassins were already on the train. The conductor was drugged and Karp&#x27;s body was found shortly afterwards in a railway tunnel south of Salzburg. Fleming had a long-standing interest in trains and, following his involvement in a near-fatal crash in 1927, associated them with danger; they also feature in &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; and &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;.

The cultural historian Jeremy Black points out that &quot;From Russia, with Love&quot; was written and published at a time when tensions between East and West were on the rise and public awareness of the Cold War was high. A joint British and American operation to tap into landline communication of the Soviet Army headquarters in Berlin using a tunnel into the Soviet-occupied zone had been publicly uncovered by the Soviets in April 1956. The same month the diver Lionel Crabb had gone missing on a mission to photograph the propeller of the Soviet cruiser &quot;Ordzhonikidze&quot; while the ship was moored in Portsmouth Harbour, an incident that was much reported and discussed in British newspapers. In October and November that year a popular uprising in Hungary was repressed by Soviet forces.

===Characters===
To make Bond a more rounded character, Fleming put further aspects of his personality into his creation. The journalist and writer Matthew Parker observes that Bond&#x27;s &quot;physical and mental ennui&quot; is a reflection of Fleming&#x27;s poor health and low spirits when he wrote the book. The early depictions of Bond were based on earlier literary characters. In &quot;New Statesman&quot;, the journalist William Cook writes of the early Bond:

James Bond is the culmination of an important but much-maligned tradition in English literature. As a boy, Fleming devoured the Bulldog Drummond tales of Lieutenant Colonel Herman Cyril McNeile (aka &quot;Sapper&quot;) and the Richard Hannay stories of John Buchan. His genius was to repackage these antiquated adventures to fit the fashion of postwar Britain ... In Bond, he created a Bulldog Drummond for the jet age.

Following on from the character development of Bond in his previous four novels, Fleming adds further background to Bond&#x27;s private life, largely around his home life and personal habits, with Bond&#x27;s introduction to the story seeing him at breakfast with his housekeeper, May. The novelist Raymond Benson—who later wrote a series of Bond novels—sees aspects of self-doubt entering Bond&#x27;s mind with the &quot;soft&quot; life he has been leading when he is introduced in the book. Benson identifies Bond&#x27;s fear when the flight to Istanbul encounters severe turbulence from a storm, and notes Bond&#x27;s apparent nervousness when he first meets Romanova; he seems concerned and guilty about his mission. The other characters in the book are also well developed, according to Benson. He considers that the head of the Turkish office, Darko Kerim Bey, is &quot;one of Fleming&#x27;s more colourful characters&quot;; Kerim is a similar type of dependable and appealing ally that Fleming also created with Quarrel (in &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;) and Colombo (in the short story &quot;Risico&quot;). Parker considers that Kerim is &quot;an antidote&quot; to Bond&#x27;s lethargy, while the essayist Umberto Eco sees the character as having some of the moral qualities of the villains in the series, but that those qualities are used in support of Bond.

&quot;From Russia, with Love&quot; is one of the few stories by Fleming in which the Soviets are the main enemy, although Eco considers Bond&#x27;s opponents &quot;so monstrous, so improbably evil that it seems impossible to take them seriously&quot;. Fleming introduced what was a new development for him, a female opponent for Bond, although much like the former adversaries in the series, Rosa Klebb is described as being physically repulsive, with poor hygiene and gross tastes. Eco—and Anthony Synnott, in his examination of aesthetics in the Bond novels—consider that despite Klebb being female, the character is more akin to a &quot;sexually neuter&quot; individual. Red Grant was Fleming&#x27;s first &quot;psychotic opponent&quot; for Bond, according to Benson. Charlie Higson—who later wrote the Young Bond series—finds Grant to be &quot;a very modern villain: the relentless, remorseless psycho with the cold dead eyes of a &#x27;drowned man&#x27;.&quot;

==Style==
According to Higson, Fleming spent the first four novels changing the style of his books, and his approach to his characters, but in &quot;From Russia, with Love&quot; the author &quot;finally hits on the classic Bond formula, and he happily moved into his most creative phase&quot;. The literary analyst LeRoy L. Panek observes that the previous novels were, in essence, episodic detective stories, while &quot;From Russia, with Love&quot; is structured differently, with an &quot;extended opening picture&quot; that describes Grant, the Russians and Romanova before moving onto the main story and then bringing back some of the elements when least expected. The extensive prose that describes the Soviet opponents and the background to the mission takes up the first ten chapters of the book, and Bond is only introduced into the story in chapter eleven. Eco says that the opening passage introducing Red Grant is a &quot;cleverly presented&quot; beginning, similar to the opening of a film. Eco remarks that &quot;Fleming abounds in such passages of high technical skill&quot;.

Benson describes the &quot;Fleming Sweep&quot; as taking the reader from one chapter to another using &quot;hooks&quot; at the end of chapters to heighten tension and pull the reader onto the next. He feels that the &quot;Fleming Sweep steadily propels the plot&quot; of &quot;From Russia, with Love&quot; and, though it was the longest of Fleming&#x27;s novels, &quot;the Sweep makes it seem half as long&quot;. Kingsley Amis, who later wrote a Bond novel, considers that the story is &quot;full of pace and conviction&quot;, while Parker identifies &quot;cracks&quot; in the plot of the novel, but believes that &quot;the action mov[es] fast enough for the reader to skim over them&quot;.

Fleming used known brand names and everyday details to produce a sense of realism, which Amis calls &quot;the Fleming effect&quot;. Amis describes &quot;the imaginative use of information, whereby the pervading fantastic nature of Bond&#x27;s world ... [is] bolted down to some sort of reality, or at least counter-balanced.&quot;

==Themes==
The cultural historians Janet Woollacott and Tony Bennett consider that Fleming&#x27;s preface note—in which he informs readers that &quot;a great deal of the background to this story is accurate&quot;—indicates that in this novel &quot;cold war tensions are most massively present, saturating the narrative from beginning to end&quot;. As in &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, the concept of the loss of British power and influence during the post-Second World War and Cold War period was also present in the novel. The journalist William Cook observes that, with the British Empire in decline, &quot;Bond pandered to Britain&#x27;s inflated and increasingly insecure self-image, flattering us with the fantasy that Britannia could still punch above her weight.&quot; Woollacott and Bennett agree, and maintain that &quot;Bond embodied the imaginary possibility that England might once again be placed at the centre of world affairs during a period when its world power status was visibly and rapidly declining.&quot; In &quot;From Russia, with Love&quot;, this acknowledgement of decline manifested itself in Bond&#x27;s conversations with Darko Kerim when he admits that in England &quot;we don&#x27;t show teeth any more—only gums.&quot;

Woollacott and Bennett argue that in selecting Bond as the target for the Soviets, he is &quot;deemed the most consummate embodiment of the myth of England&quot;. The literary critic Meir Sternberg sees the theme of Saint George and the Dragon running through several of the Bond stories, including &quot;From Russia, with Love&quot;. He sees Bond as Saint George—the patron saint of England—in the story, and notes that the opening chapter begins with an examination of a dragonfly as it flies over the supine body of Grant.

In &quot;From Russia, with Love&quot; Fleming wanted to promote a &quot;West is the best&quot; message by creating two parallel characters who would prove Western superiority over the Soviet Union. Two of the novel&#x27;s most important characters, Romanova and Grant are both defectors who go in opposite directions, and the juxtaposition of the two characters serves to contrast the two systems. According to Takors, Bond both literally and metaphorically seduces Romanova over to the West as he is able to sexually satisfy her in a way that her Russian lovers never could. The way that Bond is portrayed as sexually superior to Russian men was possibly meant by Fleming as a metaphor for how the West was superior to the Soviet Union.

==Publication and reception==

===Publication history===
&quot;From Russia, with Love&quot; was released in the UK as a hardback on 8 April 1957, by the publishers Jonathan Cape. The American edition was published a few weeks later by Macmillan. Fleming was pleased with the book and later said:

Personally I think &quot;from Russia, with Love&quot; was, in many respects, my best book, but the great thing is that each one of the books seems to have been a favourite with one or other section of the public and none has yet been completely damned.

In November 1956 the Prime Minister, Sir Anthony Eden, had visited Fleming&#x27;s Jamaican Goldeneye estate, to recuperate from a breakdown in his health following the Suez crisis. This was much reported in the British press, and the publication of &quot;From Russia, with Love&quot; was accompanied by a promotional campaign that capitalised on Fleming&#x27;s raised public profile. The serialisation of the story in &quot;The Daily Express&quot; in 1957 provided a boost to the sales of the book; a bigger rise in sales was to follow four years later. In an article in &quot;Life&quot; on 17 March 1961, the US President John F. Kennedy listed &quot;From Russia, with Love&quot; as one of his ten favourite books. This accolade, and its associated publicity, led to a surge in sales that made Fleming the biggest-selling crime writer in the US. There was a further boost to sales following the release of the film of the same name in 1963, which saw the sales of the Pan paperback rise from 145,000 in 1962 to 642,000 in 1963 and 600,000 in 1964.

In 2023 Ian Fleming Publications—the company that administers all Fleming&#x27;s literary works—had the Bond series edited as part of a sensitivity review to remove or reword some racial or ethnic descriptors. The rerelease of the series was for the 70th anniversary of &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, the first Bond novel.

===Reception===
&quot;From Russia, with Love&quot; received mainly positive reviews from critics. Julian Symons, in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, considered that it was Fleming&#x27;s &quot;tautest, most exciting and most brilliant tale&quot;, that the author &quot;brings the thriller in line with modern emotional needs&quot;, and that Bond &quot;is the intellectual&#x27;s Mike Hammer: a killer with a keen eye and a soft heart for a woman&quot;. The critic for &quot;The Times&quot; was less persuaded by the story, suggesting that &quot;the general tautness and brutality of the story leave the reader uneasily hovering between fact and fiction&quot;. Although the review compared Fleming in unflattering terms to Peter Cheyney, a crime fiction writer of the 1930s and 1940s, it concluded that &quot;From Russia, with Love&quot; was &quot;exciting enough of its kind&quot;.

&quot;The Observer&quot;″s critic, Maurice Richardson, thought that &quot;From Russia, with Love&quot; was a &quot;stupendous plot to trap ... Bond, our deluxe cad-clubman agent&quot; and wondered &quot;Is this the end of Bond?&quot; The reviewer for the &quot;Oxford Mail&quot; declared that &quot;Ian Fleming is in a class by himself&quot;, while the critic for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; argued that &quot;If a psychiatrist and a thoroughly efficient copywriter got together to produce a fictional character who would be the mid-twentieth century subconscious male ambition, the result would inevitably be James Bond.&quot;

Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Anthony Boucher—described by a Fleming biographer, John Pearson, as &quot;throughout an avid anti-Bond and an anti-Fleming man&quot;—was damning in his review, saying that &quot;From Russia, with Love&quot; was Fleming&#x27;s &quot;longest and poorest book&quot;. Boucher further wrote that the novel contained &quot;as usual, sex-cum-sadism with a veneer of literacy but without the occasional brilliant setpieces&quot;. The critic for the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, conversely, wrote that &quot;Mr Fleming is intensely observant, acutely literate and can turn a cliché into a silk purse with astute alchemy&quot;. Robert R Kirsch, writing in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, also disagreed with Boucher, saying that &quot;the espionage novel has been brought up to date by a superb practitioner of that nearly lost art: Ian Fleming.&quot; In Kirsch&#x27;s opinion, &quot;From Russia, with Love&quot; &quot;has everything of the traditional plus the most modern refinements in the sinister arts of spying&quot;.

==Adaptations==
&quot;From Russia, with Love&quot; was serialised in &quot;The Daily Express&quot; from 1 April 1957; it was the first Bond novel the paper had adapted. In 1960 the novel was also adapted as a daily comic strip in the paper and was syndicated worldwide. The series, which ran from 3 February to 21 May 1960, was written by Henry Gammidge and illustrated by John McLusky. The comic strip was reprinted in 2005 by Titan Books in the &quot;Dr. No&quot; anthology, which also included &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; and &quot;Casino Royale&quot;.

The film &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; was released in 1963, produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, and directed by Terence Young. It was the second Bond film in the Eon Productions series and starred Sean Connery as Bond. The film version contained some changes to the novel, with the leading villains switching from SMERSH to SPECTRE, a fictional terrorist organisation. In the main it was a faithful adaptation of the novel; the ending was changed to make clear Bond&#x27;s survival. Benson declares that &quot;many fans consider it &quot;the&quot; best Bond film, simply because it is close to Fleming&#x27;s original story&quot;.

The novel was dramatised for radio in 2012 by Archie Scottney, directed by Martin Jarvis and produced by Rosalind Ayres; it featured a full cast starring Toby Stephens as James Bond and was first broadcast on BBC Radio 4. It continued the series of Bond radio adaptations featuring Jarvis and Stephens following &quot;Dr. No&quot; in 2008 and &quot;Goldfinger&quot; in 2010.

<text>The Bristol Beaufort (manufacturer designation Type 152) is a British twin-engined torpedo bomber designed by the Bristol Aeroplane Company, and developed from experience gained designing and building the earlier Blenheim light bomber. At least 1,180 Beauforts were built by Bristol and other British manufacturers.

Beauforts first saw service with Royal Air Force Coastal Command and then the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm from 1940. They were used as torpedo bombers, conventional bombers and mine-layers until 1942, when they were removed from active service and were then used as trainer aircraft until being declared obsolete in 1945. Beauforts also saw considerable action in the Mediterranean; Beaufort squadrons based in Egypt and on Malta helped interdict Axis shipping supplying Rommel&#x27;s &quot;Deutsches Afrikakorps&quot; in North Africa.

Although it was designed as a torpedo-bomber, the Beaufort was more often used as a medium day bomber. The Beaufort also flew more hours in training than on operational missions and more were lost through accidents and mechanical failures than were lost to enemy fire. The Beaufort was adapted as a long-range heavy fighter variant called the Beaufighter, which proved to be very successful and many Beaufort units eventually converted to the Beaufighter.

The Australian government&#x27;s Department of Aircraft Production (DAP) also manufactured variants of the Beaufort. These are often known collectively as the DAP Beaufort. More than 700 Australian-built Beauforts saw service with the Royal Australian Air Force in the South West Pacific theatre, where they were used until the end of the war.

== Design and development ==

=== Origins ===
The Beaufort came from Bristol&#x27;s submission to meet Air Ministry Specifications M.I5/35 and G.24/35 for a land-based, twin-engined torpedo-bomber and a general reconnaissance aircraft. With a production order following under Specification 10/36, the Bristol Type 152 was given the name &quot;Beaufort&quot; after the Duke of Beaufort, whose ancestral home was nearby in Gloucestershire. The competing torpedo bomber entry from Blackburn was also ordered as the Blackburn Botha; in an unprecedented step, both designs were ordered straight off the drawing board, an indication of how urgently the RAF needed a new torpedo bomber. 320 Beauforts were ordered. Initially, because of their commitment to the Blenheim, Bristol were to build 78 at their Filton factory, with the other 242 being built by Blackburn. These allocations would be changed later.

Although the design looked similar to the Blenheim, it was somewhat larger, with an 18 in (46 cm) increase in wingspan. The fuselage was longer in the nose and taller to accommodate a fourth crew member and the aircraft was considerably heavier. The larger bomb-bay was designed to house a semi-recessed torpedo or an increased bomb load. Due to the increased weight the Bristol Mercury engines on the Blenheim were to be replaced by more powerful, sleeve valve, Bristol Perseus motors. It was soon determined that even with the Perseus, the Beaufort would be slower than the Blenheim and so a switch was made to the larger Bristol Taurus engine, another sleeve valve design. For these engines, chief designer Roy Fedden developed special low-drag NACA cowlings, which exhausted air through vertical slots flanking the nacelles under the wings. Air flow was controlled by adjustable flaps.
The basic structure, although similar to the Blenheim, introduced refinements such as the use of high-strength light alloy forgings and extrusions in place of high-tensile steel plates and angles; as a result the structure was lighter than that of the Blenheim. The wing centre section was inserted into the centre fuselage and the nacelle structure was an integral part of the ribs, to which the main undercarriage was attached. Transport joints were used on the fuselage and wings: this allowed sub-contractors to manufacture the Beaufort in easily transportable sections and was to be important when Australian production got under way. The Vickers main undercarriage units were similar to but larger than those of the Blenheim and used hydraulic retraction, with a cartridge operated emergency lowering system.

The first prototype rolled out of Filton in mid-1938. Problems immediately arose with the Taurus engines continually overheating during ground testing. New, more conventional engine cowlings, with circumferential cooling gills, had to be designed and installed, delaying the first flight, which took place on 15 October 1938. As flight testing progressed, it was found that the large apron-type undercarriage doors, similar to those on the Blenheim, were causing the aircraft to yaw on landing. These doors were taken off for subsequent flights. On the second prototype and all production aircraft, more conventional split doors, which left a small part of the tyres exposed when retracted, were used.

The results of high level bombing tests carried out at Boscombe Down at an altitude of and an airspeed of showed that the Beaufort was, in the words of the test pilot, &quot;an exceptionally poor bombing platform, being subject to an excessive and continuous roll, which made determination of drift particularly difficult&quot;. After 1941, British Beauforts were fitted with semi-circular plates on the trailing edges of the upper wing behind the engine nacelles to smooth airflow and improve directional stability.

As Blenheim production took priority and engine overheating problems continued, production was delayed; the bomber was first flown in October 1938 and should have been available almost immediately, it was not until November 1939 that production started in earnest. Several of the first production Beauforts were engaged in working-up trials and final service entry began in January 1940 with 22 Squadron of RAF Coastal Command.

=== British Beauforts ===
A total of 1,013 Taurus powered Mark Is were produced and a number of changes were introduced into the line. The original curved perspex bomb aimers&#x27; nose panels were replaced by flat, non-distorting panels from the 10th production aircraft. Successive Marks of the Bristol Taurus engine were installed: starting with the Taurus III, the more reliable Taurus IIs were used whenever possible. Initially Beauforts with the Taurus II engines were designated Beaufort Mk.II, while those with other Taurus Marks continued to be Beaufort Mk.Is. Finally all Taurus-engined Beauforts became Mk.Is with the introduction of the Pratt &amp; Whitney Twin-Wasp-powered Beaufort Mk.II. The Taurus Mk.IIs were modified to Mk.IIa, which later became the Taurus Mk.VI. All of these versions produced . The final marks of Taurus engines used were the more powerful XII and XVIs. The Taurus engines drove de Havilland Type DH5/19 constant speed propellers.

As Beaufort units entered service, it was found that the defensive armament was inadequate and extra Vickers GO machine guns were fitted; two on a gimbal mounting in the forward nose and single guns on pivots on either beam. A remotely controlled Browning machine gun was fitted, firing to the rear under the nose. Housed in a clear blown transparency, it was found to be of little use and most operational units soon discarded them.

Fairey-Youngman pneumatic dive brakes were fitted to the wing trailing edges of several Beaufort IIs. After adverse reports from pilots these were locked shut. It was found that the curved alloy extensions on the trailing edges improved the flight characteristics and similar panels were fitted on all later production Beauforts.

When it became apparent that the Taurus engines had problems, planning commenced to re-engine the aircraft with Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830 Twin-Wasp radials, which were of similar diameter and slightly lighter, driving Hamilton Standard bracket-type variable-pitch propellers. There was no guaranteed supply of the Twin Wasp and production reverted to the Taurus-engined Mark Is after 165 Beaufort Mark IIs had been built, starting with &quot;AW244&quot;, which first flew in September 1941. Performance with the Twin-Wasps was marginally improved: maximum speed went up from and the service ceiling increased from . Normal range was reduced from .

Other modifications introduced on the Mk II used on late Mk Is included replacing the elongated direction finding antenna with a loop aerial enclosed in a clear, tear-drop fairing on the top of the cabin. ASV Mk III was added with yagi antennae under the nose and wings and a Bristol B1.Mk.V turret with two Browning machine guns was fitted. The final British-built version of the Beaufort was the Pratt &amp; Whitney-powered T.Mk.II, with 250 produced from August 1943. In this version, the turret was removed and faired over. The last ever Beaufort was a T.Mk.II, which left the Bristol Banwell factory on 25 November 1944.

=== Australian-built Beauforts ===

As the design for the Beaufort began to mature, the Australian Government invited a British Air Mission to discuss the defence needs of Australia and Singapore. It was also a step towards expanding the Australian aircraft industry. The Beaufort was chosen as the best General Reconnaissance (G.R.) aircraft available and on 1 July 1939, orders were placed for 180 airframes and spares, with the specially formed Beaufort Division of the Commonwealth Department of Aircraft Production (DAP).

The Australian Beauforts were to be built at the established DAP plant in Fishermans Bend, Melbourne and a new factory at Mascot, New South Wales; to speed up the process drawings, jigs and tools and complete parts for six airframes were supplied by Bristol. The bulk of Australian-built Beauforts used locally available materials.

One of the decisive factors in choosing the Beaufort was the ability to produce it in sections. Because of this, railway workshops were key subcontractors:
* Chullora Railway Workshops NSW: Front fuselage, undercarriage, stern frames, nacelles.
* Newport Workshops Victoria: Rear fuselage, empennage.
* Islington Railway Workshops, South Australia: Mainplanes, centre-section.

Taurus engines, aircraft components and the associated equipment were shipped out to be joined in October 1939, by the eighth production Beaufort &quot;L4448&quot;. With the outbreak of war, the possibility that supplies of the Taurus engines could be disrupted or halted was considered, even before the British government placed an embargo on exporting war materials with the Blitzkrieg on France, the Netherlands and Belgium in May 1940. It was proposed that a change of powerplant could be made to the Pratt &amp; Whitney Twin Wasp, which was already in use on Royal Australian Air Force Lockheed Hudsons. Orders for the engine were placed and a factory was set up at Lidcombe and run by General Motors Holden. The locally built engines were coded S3C4-G, while those imported from America were coded S1C3-4. Three-bladed Curtiss-Electric propellers were fitted to Beaufort Mks V, VI, VIII and IX while Beaufort Mks VA and VIII used Hamilton Standard propellers. In early 1941, &quot;L4448&quot; was converted as a trials aircraft and the combination was considered a success. The first Australian-assembled Beaufort &quot;A9-1&quot; flew on 5 May 1941 with the first Australian-built aircraft &quot;A9-7&quot; coming off the production line in August. In total 700 Australian Beauforts were manufactured in six series (see variants).

A distinguishing feature of Australian Beauforts was a larger fin, which was used from the Mk VI on. Armament varied from British aircraft: British or American torpedoes were able to be carried and the final 140 Mk VIII were fitted with a locally manufactured Mk VE turret with .50 cal machine guns. A distinctive diamond-shaped DF aerial was fitted on the cabin roof, replacing the loop antenna. Other Australian improvements included fully enclosed landing gear and Browning M2 machine guns in the wings. Some were also fitted with ASV radar aerial arrays on either side of the rear fuselage.

The Mk.XI was a transport conversion, stripped of armament, operational equipment and armour and rebuilt with a redesigned centre fuselage. Maximum speed was and a payload of could be carried. Production of the Australian Beaufort ended in August 1944 when production switched to the Beaufighter.

== Operational history ==
=== Europe ===

Although it did see some use as a torpedo bomber, including attacks on the battleships and while in port in Brest, the Beaufort more often used bombs in European service.

In early 1940, 22 Squadron equipped with Vildebeests, began to receive Beauforts. The Beaufort was a much faster, heavier aircraft than the biplane and the crews needed a great deal of training in torpedo-dropping, using new techniques required by the Beaufort. The lighter, slower Vildebeest was able to dive then flatten out before launching the torpedo; Beauforts carried too much speed after diving so it needed a longer, level approach to the torpedo drop. Because of this, and because of a shortage of torpedoes, the squadron&#x27;s first operations consisted of laying magnetic mines (&quot;Gardening&quot; in RAF parlance) and dropping conventional bombs. As an alternative to the torpedo, the Beaufort could carry a bomb using a purpose built carrier. On one of its first bombing sorties, on 7 May 1940, a Beaufort dropped the first British bomb, at a German cruiser anchored off Norderney.

The first Beaufort operation took place on the night of 15/16 April, when nine Beauforts laid mines in the Schillig Roads (north of Wilhelmshaven). One Beaufort failed to return. A second unit, 42 Squadron began to re-equip with Beauforts, starting in April. The Beaufort still had teething problems and after some Beauforts were lost in mysterious circumstances, a Court of Enquiry in June 1940 concluded that the Taurus engines were still unreliable and both operational squadrons were grounded until the engines could be modified.

The first RAF torpedo attack of the war came on 11 September 1940, when five aircraft of 22 Squadron attacked a convoy of three merchant ships off Ostend (Oostende in Belgium). One torpedo hit a ship. Four days later, the first &quot;Rover&quot; was mounted; a Rover was an armed reconnaissance mission carried out against enemy shipping by a small number of aircraft operating independently. &quot;Rovers&quot; became a major part of Beaufort operations over the next 18 months. Other more hazardous operations were to follow, with one Beaufort pilot being awarded a posthumous VC.

The only other UK based units to be equipped and fly operationally with the Beaufort, 86 Squadron and 217 Squadron, were operational by the middle of 1941. Beauforts also equipped some Commonwealth Article XV squadrons serving within the RAF but because of supply shortages, were replaced by other aircraft types before the units flew operationally.

==== Torpedo dropping ====
A successful torpedo drop required that the approach run to the target needed to be straight and at a speed and height where the torpedo would enter the water smoothly: too high or too low and the torpedo could &quot;porpoise&quot; (skip through the water), dive or even break up. Height over the water had to be judged without the benefit of a radio altimeter and misjudgement was easy, especially in calm conditions. For the Beauforts using the 18-inch (450-mm) Mk XII aerial torpedo, the average drop-height was and the average range of release was . During the run-in, the aircraft was vulnerable to defensive anti-aircraft fire and it took courage to fly through it with no chance of evasive manoeuvres. The Beaufort&#x27;s optimum torpedo dropping speed was a great deal higher than that of the Vildebeests it replaced, and it took practice to judge the range and speed of the target ship. A ship the size and speed of &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; would look huge, filling the windscreen at well over and it was easy to underestimate the range. In action, torpedoes were often released too far away from the target, although there was one recorded instance of a torpedo being released too close. For safety reasons, torpedo warheads had a set distance (usually about from the release point before they were armed. It also took some distance for the torpedo to settle to its running depth. Once the torpedo had been dropped, if there was room, a sharp turn away from the enemy was possible: more often than not the aircraft had to fly around or over the ship, usually at full-throttle and below mast height. A sharp pull-up could be fatal as it exposed a large area of the aircraft to anti-aircraft guns.

==== Attacks on capital ships ====
Some of the Beaufort&#x27;s actions were attacks on warships of the German &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;. The first attack was on 21 June 1940, when nine Beauforts of 42 Squadron attacked the off the Norwegian coast. No torpedoes were available at RAF Wick and a dive bombing attack was carried out using two bombs. The Beauforts encountered Messerschmitt Bf 109s protecting the battleship and only four returned; shortly after, Beauforts were grounded for modifications to their Taurus engines.

In early April 1941, after an air raid on Brest by Bomber Command, the had to move out of dry-dock because of an un-exploded bomb. Photo reconnaissance revealed that the ship was in the inner harbour. An estimated 1,000 flak guns of all calibres protected the base and adding complication to the danger was the realisation that &quot;Gneisenau&quot; was only about from a harbour mole, requiring extremely accurate torpedo drops. The aircraft would be forced into a steep banking turn during the escape to avoid rising ground surrounding the harbour. In spite of these dangers 22 Squadron, based at RAF St Eval, was ordered to make a torpedo attack, timed to take place just after dawn on 6 April 1941. It was planned to attack the torpedo nets thought to be protecting the ship, using three Beauforts armed with bombs; another three Beauforts would then attack the ship with torpedoes. Following heavy rain that had drenched the airfield, the bomb-carrying aircraft became bogged down. Because of a sea mist, the other three Beauforts arrived at Brest independently; one, flown by F/O Kenneth Campbell, managed to penetrate the harbour and torpedo &quot;Gneisenau&quot; but was shot down immediately afterwards. Campbell was awarded the VC and his Observer, Sergeant J. P. Scott of Canada, the Distinguished Flying Medal. The other two crew members were Sgts R. W. Hillman and W. Mallis; all were lost.

On the night of 12/13 June 1941, 13 Beauforts of 42 Squadron, based at RAF Leuchars and a detachment of five Beauforts of 22 Squadron from Wick, were sent out to find the heavy cruiser and an escort of four destroyers, which had been sighted near Norway. At midnight, a signal from a Blenheim of 114 Squadron confirmed the position of the ships but most of the Beauforts failed to find them. One 42 Squadron aircraft piloted by Flight Sergeant Ray Loveitt (who had become separated from the main force) took &quot;Lützow&quot; by surprise. Loveitt did not attack at once but remained in the vicinity, simulating a German escort plane. Copying the recognition signals that other Junkers Ju 88 and Messerschmitt Bf 110 exchanged with the German ships, Loveitt was able to attack without a defensive shot being fired, Loviett&#x27;s torpedo hit her on the port side. The ship took on a heavy list and lost all speed. The hit also activated her smokescreen generator and one other Beaufort attacking &quot;Lūtzow&quot; missed because of the smokescreen. The plane was then shot down by a Messerschmitt Bf 109; &quot;Lützow&quot; was under repair for six months.

During the famous Operation Cerberus, the &quot;Channel Dash&quot; by &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; and the heavy cruiser , which took place from 12 February 1942, three Beaufort units, with 33 serviceable aircraft were available: 22 Squadron was under orders to move to Singapore. 42 Squadron, based at Leuchars in Scotland, was supposed to move to Manston but had been delayed by snow. Only 86 and 217 squadrons were in position to attack the German ships. Of the 33 Beauforts, 28 eventually set out to attack the German ships: 13 failed to find them, three were shot down and on one the torpedo failed to release. Only 11 Beauforts sighted the battleships and launched torpedoes, none of which struck a target. One of the conclusions reached by a later Court of Inquiry was that a faster, longer-ranged torpedo bomber than the Beaufort was needed. Bristol was already working on a torpedo-carrying conversion of the Beaufighter (a development of the Beaufort airframe) and were later to develop the Brigand.

The final major operation to feature Beauforts before they were moved to other theatres was an attack on the heavy cruiser &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;. A report reached Coastal Command on 16 May 1942 that this ship, escorted by two destroyers, was off Trondheim steaming south-west at high speed. A strike force was formed with 12 Beauforts of 42 Squadron, six Blenheims of 404 (RCAF) Squadron and four flak-suppression Beaufighters, two each from 235 Squadron and 248 Squadron. &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; was sighted with four destroyers. The Beaufighters went first, raking the ships with cannon fire as the Blenheims made dummy torpedo runs. Some Bf 109s (more than likely from I./JG 5) appeared and the Blenheims attempted to fend them off as the Beauforts started their attack. Three Beauforts were shot down by defensive fire from the ships before they could launch their torpedoes and the nine torpedoes that were launched failed to hit the target. One Beaufort, already damaged by anti-aircraft fire, was then attacked by three Bf 109s: in spite of further heavy damage, the pilot made a successful crash-landing back at base. In the meantime, another strike force of 15 Beauforts from 86 Squadron was sent too far north by a reporting error. They too were attacked by Bf 109s: four Beauforts were shot down (in return the crews claimed to have shot down five fighters) and of the 11 Beauforts remaining, seven were forced to jettison their torpedoes.

In spite of its failure, this operation set the pattern for Coastal Command operations: Beaufighters were used for the first time for &quot;flak&quot;-suppression and escort and there had been diversionary tactics used to try to reduce attention on the attacking torpedo aircraft. It also marked the end of Beaufort operations from Britain.

The remaining Beaufort squadrons now started moving east:
* 42 Squadron left Scotland in June 1942 bound for Ceylon but operated in North Africa until December.
* 86 Squadron moved to the Mediterranean in July and the unit was reduced to cadre: In October it was re-equipped with Consolidated Liberator Mk.IIIs. One ex-86 Squadron Beaufort flight, along with one from 217 Squadron, joined up with a flight from 39 Squadron on Malta, later becoming a part of a reconstituted 39 Squadron.
* The 217 Squadron ground echelon left for Ceylon in May 1942, while the Beauforts flew out via Malta. In August, 217 Squadron, minus a Beaufort flight, moved on to Ceylon to be re-equipped with Hudsons. 22 Squadron at various times operated Beauforts out of Vavuniya and Ratmalana, Ceylon.

=== Mediterranean and Malta ===

The first Beaufort unit in the Mediterranean was 39 Squadron, which reformed in Egypt in January 1941. Initially equipped with Bristol Blenheims and Martin Marylands, the unit started re-equipping with Beaufort Mk.Is the following August. The first operation in which Beauforts took part was an attack on the Italian T18 on 28 January 1942. The three Beauforts of 39 Squadron included in a large strike force succeeded in crippling the transport &quot;Victoria&quot;, which was carrying 1,400 troops. The ship was then sunk by four Albacores of 820 Naval Air Squadron. Escort ships rescued 1,046 troops.

In another operation, during the early hours of 15 June 1942, nine Beauforts of 217 Squadron, which had just flown in from England, took off from RAF Luqa, Malta to intercept ships of the &quot;Regia Marina&quot;, which had sailed from Taranto. Few of the Beaufort crews had experience in night-flying: four aircraft failed to find the rendezvous and set out independently. One, flown by Flying Officer Arthur Aldridge discovered the Italian Fleet some to the east of Malta. Like Loviett&#x27;s attack on &quot;Lūtzow&quot;, his Beaufort was mistaken for a friendly aircraft by Italian lookouts. Aldridge torpedoed and crippled the heavy cruiser , whose anti-aircraft fire started only after the Beaufort had escaped. The main formation of Beauforts then came in to attack, having been guided in by the gunfire. In the confusion and the smokescreen that had been laid by the Italian warships, 217 Squadron claimed several torpedo hits for the loss of one Beaufort, which belly-landed at Luqa. In spite of the claims, none of the other ships had been hit. &quot;Trento&quot; was sunk later by two torpedoes fired by the submarine , which had witnessed the aerial attack.

By July 1942, 86 Squadron Beauforts and crews had arrived on Malta and were soon absorbed into a reconstituted 39 Squadron, which came under the command of the inspirational Squadron Leader Patrick Gibbs, who was soon promoted to Wing Commander; 217 squadron moved on to Ceylon.

Over the next 11 months, the Beaufort force, now usually accompanied by Beaufighters, was instrumental in crippling the convoy supply lines that were vital to Rommel&#x27;s &quot;Afrika Korps&quot;. At night, torpedo-carrying Vickers Wellingtons of 38 Squadron also played an important part in attacking convoys. Some important ships destroyed or badly damaged were:

* MV (Motor Vessel) &quot;Reichenfels&quot;, 7,744 GRT: torpedoed by 217 Sqn Beaufort, 21 June.
* MV &quot;Rosalino Pilo&quot;, 8,326 GRT: torpedoed by two aircraft of 39 Sqn, torpedoed and sunk by submarine , 17 August.
* Tanker &quot;Pozarica&quot;, 7,800 tons (7,925 tonnes): torpedoed and badly damaged by three aircraft of 39 Sqn, later beached, 21 August.
* Steam Ship &quot;Dielpi&quot;, 1,500 tons (1,360 tonnes) : torpedoed and sunk by three aircraft of 217 Sqn, 27 August.
* Tanker &quot;San Andrea&quot;, 5,077 tons (4,606 tonnes) : torpedoed and sunk by two aircraft of 39 Sqn, 30 August. (Gibbs&#x27; last operation.)
* Tanker &quot;Proserpina&quot;, 4,869 GRT : Destroyed by combined strike of Beauforts of 47 Sqn and Bisleys of 15 SAAF Sqn, 27 October.
* Tanker &quot;Thorsheimer&quot;, 9,955 tons (9,031 tonnes): Torpedoed by four Beauforts of 39 Sqn, 21 February 1943.

In June 1943, 39 Squadron, the last operational Beaufort unit, converted to Beaufighters.

=== Pacific ===
During the first years of World War II, the Australian government found itself unable to procure twin-engine bomber aircraft for home duties in Australia. It was decided that the Australian Department of Aircraft Production (DAP) would build Beauforts under licence, for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF).

By late 1941, British authorities had also ordered 180 Australian-built Beauforts for the RAF Far East Command, for use in East Asia. In particular, DAP Beauforts were to replace the extremely outdated (1928) Vickers Vildebeests operated by No. 100 Squadron RAF at Singapore. Q Flight, a detachment from 100 Squadron was based in Australia for operational conversion purposes.

When Japan entered the war and invaded Malaya on 8 December 1941, about 20 DAP Beauforts had been completed and delivered to Q Flight in Australia. Only six Australian-built Beauforts reached Singapore, just after hostilities began. Over Malaya and Singapore, 100 Squadron continued to operate Vildebeests, suffering severe losses. One Beaufort, attached to Air Headquarters, Singapore as a reconnaissance aircraft was attacked, during its first sortie, by Japanese fighters, severely damaged and written-off. The RAF decided that the Beaufort lacked sufficient performance and armament to defend itself against late model fighters, and that 100 Squadron&#x27;s crews lacked sufficient training and experience on the type. As Japanese forces approached Singapore in early 1942, RAF bases there were abandoned; the remaining Beauforts and 100 Squadron personnel were evacuated to Australia. All Australian-built Beauforts previously scheduled for British squadrons were subsequently delivered to the RAAF.

The first Beaufort unit formed in Australia, on 25 February 1942 was No. 100 Squadron RAAF, so named because it was formed partly from members of its RAF counterpart. In the light of the problems encountered by the first Beauforts based at Singapore, the unit was carefully trained and slowly brought up to operational status. Its first operational sorties were carried out on 25 June when a Japanese ship heading towards Lae, New Guinea was attacked by five Beauforts operating from Port Moresby, which resulted in three Beauforts hitting the ship with bombs, with one Beaufort being damaged by anti-aircraft fire. Out of two Beauforts that carried out a diversionary attack on Lae, one failed to return.

Production at DAP continued to increase, reaching almost one a day in 1943. The Beaufort served with 19 RAAF squadrons and played an important role in the South West Pacific Area, as a maritime patrol/strike aircraft and bomber. Aviation historian William Green has written that the Beaufort&#x27;s &quot;part in the defeat of the Japanese forces in the South-West Pacific was probably of greater importance than that of any other single aircraft type.&quot;

In the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, on 3 March 1943, eight Beauforts from No. 100 Squadron RAAF took off from the Milne Bay to attack the Japanese troop convoy with torpedoes although no hits were scored. Later in the battle, 13 Beaufighters from No. 30 Squadron RAAF approached the convoy at low level to give the impression they were Beauforts making a torpedo attack. The ships turned to face them, the standard procedure to present a smaller target to torpedo bombers, allowing the Beaufighters to maximise the damage they inflicted on the ships&#x27; anti-aircraft guns, bridges and crews in strafing runs with their autocannons and machine guns.

== Replacement ==
In March 1942 a Bristol Beaufighter was successfully tested as a torpedo-carrier and from 1943 a number of Middle East-based squadrons replaced the Beaufort with the so-called &quot;torbeau&quot; (Beaufighter TF Mk X). The last RAF aircraft was retired in 1946

<text>John William Mauchly ( ; August 30, 1907January 8, 1980) was an American physicist who, along with J. Presper Eckert, designed ENIAC, the first general-purpose electronic digital computer, as well as EDVAC, BINAC and UNIVAC I, the first commercial computer made in the United States.

Together, Mauchly and Eckert started the first computer company, the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation (EMCC), and pioneered fundamental computer concepts, including the stored program, subroutines, and programming languages. Their work, as exposed in the widely read &quot;First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC&quot; (1945) and as taught in the Moore School Lectures (1946), influenced an explosion of computer development in the late 1940s all over the world.

==Biography==
John W. Mauchly was born on August 30, 1907, to Sebastian and Rachel (Scheidemantel) Mauchly in Cincinnati, Ohio. His family was of German descent, and his father spoke German, but Mauchly didn&#x27;t grow up speaking it as it was not spoken in the family. He moved with his parents and sister, Helen Elizabeth (Betty), at an early age to Chevy Chase, Maryland, when Sebastian Mauchly obtained a position at the Carnegie Institution of Washington as head of its Section of Terrestrial Electricity. As a youth, Mauchly was interested in science, and in particular with electricity, and as a young teenager was known to fix neighbors&#x27; electric systems. Mauchly attended E.V. Brown Elementary School in Chevy Chase and McKinley Technical High School in Washington, DC. At McKinley, Mauchly was extremely active in the debate team, was a member of the national honor society, and became editor-in-chief of the school&#x27;s newspaper, Tech Life. After graduating from high school in 1925, he earned a scholarship to study engineering at Johns Hopkins University. He subsequently transferred to the physics department, and without completing his undergraduate degree, instead earned a Ph.D. in physics in 1932.

From 1932 to 1933, Mauchly served as a research assistant at Johns Hopkins University where he concentrated on calculating energy levels of the formaldehyde spectrum. Mauchly&#x27;s teaching career truly began in 1933 at Ursinus College where he was appointed head of the physics department, where he was, in fact, the only staff member.

In the summer of 1941, Mauchly took a Defense Training Course for Electronics at the University of Pennsylvania Moore School of Electrical Engineering. There he met the lab instructor, J. Presper Eckert (1919–1995), with whom he would form a long-standing working partnership. Following the course, Mauchly was hired as an instructor of electrical engineering and in 1943, he was promoted to assistant professor of electrical engineering. Following the outbreak of World War II, the United States Army Ordnance Department contracted the Moore School to build an electronic computer which, as proposed by Mauchly and Eckert, would accelerate the recomputation of artillery firing tables.

In 1959, Mauchly left Sperry Rand and started Mauchly Associates, Inc. One of Mauchly Associates&#x27; notable achievements was the development of the Critical Path Method (CPM) which provided for automated construction scheduling. Mauchly also set up a consulting organization, Dynatrend, in 1967 and worked as a consultant to Sperry UNIVAC from 1973 until his death in 1980.

John Mauchly died on January 8, 1980, in Ambler, Pennsylvania, during heart surgery and following a long illness. His first wife, Mary Augusta Walzl, a mathematician, whom he married on December 30, 1930, drowned in 1946. John and Mary Mauchly had two children, James (Jimmy) and Sidney. In 1948, Mauchly married Kathleen Kay McNulty (1921–2006), one of the six original ENIAC programmers; they had five children Sara (Sallie), Kathleen (Kathy), John, Virginia (Gini), and Eva.

==Moore School==
In 1941 Mauchly took a course in wartime electronics at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering, part of the University of Pennsylvania. There he met J. Presper Eckert, a recent Moore School graduate. Mauchly accepted a teaching position at the Moore School, which was a center for wartime computing. Eckert encouraged Mauchly to believe that vacuum tubes could be made reliable with proper engineering practices. The critical problem that was consuming the Moore School was ballistics: the calculation of firing tables for the large number of new guns that the U.S. Army was developing for the war effort.

===ENIAC===

In 1942 Mauchly wrote a memo proposing the building of a general-purpose electronic computer. The proposal, which circulated within the Moore School (but the significance of which was not immediately recognized), emphasized the enormous speed advantage that could be gained by using digital electronics with no moving parts. Lieutenant Herman Goldstine, who was the liaison between the United States Army and Moore School, picked up on the idea and asked Mauchly to write a formal proposal. In April 1943, the Army contracted with the Moore School to build the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC). Mauchly led the conceptual design while Eckert led the hardware engineering on ENIAC. A number of other talented engineers contributed to the confidential &quot;Project PX&quot;.

Because of its high-speed calculations, ENIAC could solve problems that were previously unsolvable. It was roughly a thousand times faster than the existing technology. It could add 5,000 numbers or do 357 10-digit multiplications in one second.

ENIAC could be programmed to perform sequences and loops of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square-root, input/output functions, and conditional branches. Programming was initially accomplished with patch cords and switches, and reprogramming took days. It was redesigned in 1948 to allow the use of stored programs with some loss in speed.

In 2002, for his work on ENIAC he was inducted, posthumously, into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.

==EDVAC==
The ENIAC design was frozen in 1944 to allow construction. Eckert and Mauchly were already aware of the limitations of the machine and began plans on a second computer, to be called EDVAC. By January 1945 they had procured a contract to build this stored-program computer. Eckert had proposed a mercury delay-line memory to store both program and data. Later that year, mathematician John von Neumann learned of the project and joined in some of the engineering discussions. He produced what was understood to be an internal document describing the EDVAC.

The term von Neumann architecture arose from von Neumann&#x27;s paper &quot;First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC&quot;. Dated June 30, 1945, it was an early written account of a general-purpose stored-program computing machine (the EDVAC). Goldstine, in a move that was to become controversial, removed any reference to Eckert or Mauchly and distributed the document to a number of von Neumann&#x27;s associates across the country. The ideas became widely known within the very small world of computer designers.

Besides the lack of credit, Eckert and Mauchly suffered additional setbacks due to Goldstine&#x27;s actions. The ENIAC patent , issued in 1964 was filed on June 26, 1947, and granted February 4, 1964, but the public disclosure of design details of EDVAC in the &quot;First Draft&quot; (which were also common to ENIAC) was later cited as one cause for the 1973 invalidation of the ENIAC patent.

==The Moore School Lectures==

In March 1946, just after the ENIAC was announced, the Moore School decided to change their patent policy, in order to gain commercial rights to any future and past computer development there. Eckert and Mauchly decided this was unacceptable; they resigned. However they had already been contracted to do one more thing at the Moore School: to give a series of talks on computer design.

The course &quot;The Theory and Techniques for Design of Digital Computers&quot;, ran from July 8 to August 31, 1946. Eckert gave 11 of the lectures; Mauchly and Goldstine each delivered 6. &quot;The Moore School Lectures&quot;, as they came to be known, were attended by representatives from the army, the navy, MIT, the National Bureau of Standards, Cambridge University, Columbia, Harvard, the Institute for Advanced Study, IBM, Bell Labs, Eastman Kodak, General Electric, and National Cash Register. A number of the attendees were to later go on to develop computers, such as Maurice Wilkes, of Cambridge, who built EDSAC.

==Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation==
In 1947 Eckert and Mauchly formed the first computer company, the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation (EMCC); Mauchly was president. They secured a contract with the National Bureau of Standards to build an &quot;EDVAC II&quot;, later named UNIVAC. UNIVAC, the first computer designed for business applications, had many significant technical advantages such as magnetic tape for mass storage. As an interim product, the company created and delivered a smaller computer, BINAC, but were still in a shaky financial situation. They were purchased by Remington Rand and became the UNIVAC division.

==Software==
Very early in the history of EMCC, John Mauchly assumed responsibility for programming, coding, and applications for the planned computer systems. His early interaction with representatives of the Census Bureau in 1944 and 1945, and discussion with people interested in statistics, weather prediction, and various business problems in 1945 and 1946 focused his attention on the need to provide new users with the software to accomplish their objectives. He knew it would be difficult to sell computers without application materials, and without training in how to use the systems. And so, EMCC began to assemble a staff of mathematicians interested in coding in early 1947. (from Norberg)

Mauchly&#x27;s interest lay in the application of computers, as well as to their architecture and organization. His experience with programming the ENIAC and its successors led him to create Short Code (see &quot;The UNIVAC SHORT CODE&quot;), the first programming language actually used on a computer (predated by Zuse&#x27;s conceptual Plankalkul). It was a pseudocode interpreter for mathematical problems proposed in 1949 and ran on the UNIVAC I and II. Mauchly&#x27;s belief in the importance of languages led him to hire Grace Murray Hopper to develop a compiler for the UNIVAC.

John Mauchly has also been credited for being the first one using the verb &quot;to program&quot; in his 1942 paper on electronic computing, although in the context of ENIAC, not in its current meaning.

==Career==
Mauchly stayed involved in computers for the rest of his life. He was a founding member and president of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and also helped found the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM), serving as its fourth president. The Eckert–Mauchly Corporation was bought by Remington Rand in 1950 and for ten years Mauchly remained as Director of Univac Applications Research. Leaving in 1959 he formed Mauchly Associates, a consulting company that later introduced the critical path method (CPM) for construction scheduling by computer. In 1967 he founded Dynatrend, a computer consulting organization. In 1973 he became a consultant to Sperry Univac.

==Awards==
Mauchly received numerous award and honors. He was a life member of the Franklin Institute, the National Academy of Engineering and the Society for Advancement of Management. He was elected a Fellow of the IRE, a predecessor society of IEEE, in 1957, and was a Fellow of the American Statistical Association. He received an LLD (Hon) degree from the University of Pennsylvania and aDSc(Hon) degree from Ursinus College. He was a recipient of the Philadelphia Award, the Scott Medal, the Goode Medal of AFIPS (American Federation of Information Processing Societies), the Pennsylvania Award, the Emanual R. Piore Award, the Howard N. Potts Medal, and numerous other awards.

==Patent controversy==

Mauchly and Eckert&#x27;s patent on the ENIAC was invalidated by U.S. Federal Court decision in October, 1973 for several reasons. Some had to do with the time between publication (the &quot;First Draft&quot;) and the patent filing date (1947). The federal judge who presided over the case ruled that &quot;the subject matter was derived&quot; from the earlier Atanasoff–Berry computer (ABC). This statement has become the center of a controversy.

Critics note that while the court said that the ABC was the first electronic digital computer, it did not define the term computer. It had originally referred to a person who computes, but was adapted to apply to a machine.

Critics of the court decision also note that there is, at a component level, nothing in common between the two machines. The ABC was binary; the ENIAC was decimal. The ABC used regenerative drum memory; The ENIAC used electronic decade counters. The ABC used its vacuum tubes to implement a binary serial adder, while the ENIAC used tubes to implement a complete set of decimal operations. The ENIAC&#x27;s general-purpose instruction set, together with the ability to automatically sequence through them, made it a general-purpose computer. However, the later EDVAC computer, developed without the immediate pressures of wartime projects, harked back more to the ABC in that it was a binary computer employing regenerative memory.

Proponents for the court decision emphasize that the testimony established that Mauchly definitely visited Atanasoff&#x27;s lab at Iowa State College, had complete access to Atanasoff&#x27;s machine and the documents describing it. Letters he wrote to Atanasoff show that he was at one time at least considering building on Atanasoff&#x27;s approach.

Mauchly consistently maintained that it was the use of high-speed electronic flip-flops in cosmic-ray counting devices at Swarthmore College that gave him the idea for computing at electronic speeds.

<text>The Sea of Azov is an inland shelf sea in Eastern Europe connected to the Black Sea by the narrow (about ) Strait of Kerch, and sometimes regarded as a northern extension of the Black Sea. The sea is bounded by Russia on the east, and by Ukraine on the northwest and southwest (the parts of Ukraine bordering the sea are currently under Russian occupation). It is an important access route for Central Asia, from the Caspian Sea via the Volga–Don Canal.

The sea is largely affected by the inflow of the Don, Kuban, and other rivers, which bring sand, silt, and shells, which in turn form numerous bays, limans, and narrow spits. Because of these deposits, the sea bottom is relatively smooth and flat, with the depth gradually increasing toward the middle. Because of the river inflow, water in the sea has low salinity and a high amount of biomass (such as green algae) that affects the water colour. Abundant plankton result in unusually high fish productivity. The sea shores and spits are low; they are rich in vegetation and bird colonies. The Sea of Azov is the shallowest sea in the world, with the depth varying between . There is a constant outflow of water from the Sea of Azov to the Black Sea.

==Names==
The name is likely to derive from the settlement of an area around Azov, whose name comes from the Kipchak Turkish &quot;asak&quot; or &quot;azaq&quot; &#x27;lowlands&#x27;. A Russian pseudo-etymology, however, instead derives it from an eponymous Cuman prince named &quot;Azum&quot; or &quot;Asuf&quot;, said to have been killed defending his town in 1067. A formerly common spelling of the name in English was the .

In antiquity, the sea was known as the Maeotis Swamp (, &quot;hē Maiōtis límnē&quot;; ), from the marshlands to its northeast. It remains unclear whether it was named for the nearby Maeotians or viceversa if that name was an exonym, broadly applied to various peoples who happened to live beside it. Other names included or Maeotius (&#x27; or &#x27;); the Maeotian or (&#x27; or &#x27;); the Cimmerian or (&#x27; or &#x27;); and the Cimmerian or (&#x27; or &#x27;). The Maeotians themselves were said by Pliny to call the sea Temarunda (alternative spellings Temarenda and Temerinda), meaning &quot;Mother of Waters&quot;. 

The medieval Russians knew it as the after the adjacent city now known as Sudak. It was known in Ottoman Turkish as the &quot;Balük-Denis&quot; (&quot;Fish Sea&quot;) from its high productivity.

==History==
===Prehistory===

There are traces of Neolithic settlement in the area now covered by the sea.

In 1997, William Ryan and Walter Pitman of Columbia University published a theory that a massive flood through the Bosporus occurred in ancient times. They claim that the Black and Caspian Seas were vast freshwater lakes, but in about the Mediterranean spilled over a rocky sill at the Bosporus, creating the current link between the Black and Mediterranean Seas. Subsequent work has been done both to support and to discredit this theory, and archaeologists still debate it. This has led some to associate this catastrophe with prehistoric flood myths.
===Antiquity===

The Maeotian marshes around the mouth of the Tanais River (the present-day Don) were famous in antiquity, as they served as an important check on the migration of nomadic people from the Eurasian steppelands. The Maeotians themselves lived by fishing and farming, but were avid warriors able to defend themselves against invaders. Misled by its strong currents, ancient geographers had only a vague idea of the extent of the sea, whose fresh water caused them to typically label it a &quot;swamp&quot; or a &quot;lake&quot;. Herodotus (5th century BC) judged it as large as the Black Sea, while the Pseudo-Scylax (4th century BC) thought it about half as large.

It was long believed to provide direct communication with the Arctic Ocean. Polybius (2nd century BC) confidently expected that the strait to the Sea of Azov would close in the near future, due to ongoing deposition of sediments from rivers. In the 1st century, Strabo reckoned the distance from the Cimmerian Bosporus (the Strait of Kerch) to the mouth of the Tanais at , a roughly correct figure, but did not know that its width continuously narrows.

Milesian colonization began in the 7th century BC. The Bosporan Kingdom was named for the Cimmerian Bosporus rather than for the more famous Bosporus at the other end of the Black Sea. Briefly annexed by Pontus from the late 2nd century BC, it stretched along both southern shores of the Sea of Azov from the time of Greek colonization to the end of the Roman Empire, serving as a client kingdom which exported wheat, fish, and slaves in exchange for Greek and Roman manufactures and luxuries. Its later history is uncertain but probably the Huns, after defeating the Alans people who had settled in the region from central Asia, overran it in the late 4th century.

===Azov campaigns of 1695–96 and 1736–37===
The Sea of Azov was frequently the scene of military conflicts between Russia, pursuing naval expansion to the south, and the major power in the region, Turkey. During the Russo-Turkish War (1686–1700), there were two campaigns in 1695–96 to capture the then Turkish fortress of Azov defended by a garrison of 7,000. The campaigns were headed by Peter I and aimed to gain Russian access to the Sea of Azov and Black Sea. The first campaign began in the spring of 1695. The Russian army consisted of 31 thousand men and 170 cannons and included selected trained regiments and Cossacks. It reached Azov on 27–28 June and besieged it by land by 5 July. After two unsuccessful assaults on 5 August and 25 September, the siege was lifted.

The second campaign involved both ground forces and the Azov fleet, which was built in Moscow Oblast, Voronezh, Bryansk and other regions between winter 1695 and spring 1696. In April 1696, the army of 75,000 headed by Aleksei Shein moved to Azov by land and by ship via the Don River to Taganrog. In early May, they were joined by another fleet led by Peter I. On 27 May, the Russian fleet blocked Azov by sea. On 14 June, the Turkish fleet tried to break the blockade but, after losing two ships, retreated to the sea. After intensive bombardment of the fortress from land and sea, on 17 July the Russian army broke the defense lines and occupied parts of the wall. After heavy fighting, the garrison surrendered on 17 July. After the war, the Russian fleet base was moved to Taganrog and Azov, and 215 ships were built there between 1696 and 1711. In 1711, as a result of the Russo-Turkish War (1710–1711) and the Treaty of the Pruth, Azov was returned to Turkey and the Russian Azov fleet was destroyed. The city was recaptured by Russia in 1737 during the Russo-Austrian-Turkish War (1735–1739). However, as a result of the consequent Treaty of Niš, Russia was not allowed to keep the fortress and military fleet.

===Crimean War 1853–1856===
Another major military campaign on the Sea of Azov took place during the Crimean War of 1853–56. A naval and ground campaign pitting the allied navies of Britain and France against Russia took place between May and November 1855. The British and French forces besieged Taganrog, aiming to disrupt Russian supplies to Crimea. Capturing Taganrog would also result in an attack on Rostov, which was a strategic city for Russian support of their Caucasian operations. On 12 May 1855, the allied forces easily captured Kerch and gained access to the Sea of Azov, and on 22 May they attacked Taganrog. The attack failed and was followed by a siege. Despite the vast superiority of the allied forces (about 16,000 soldiers against fewer than 2,000), the city withstood all attempts to capture it, which ended around August 1855 with the retreat of the allied army. Individual coastal attacks continued without success and ceased in October 1855.

===21st century===
In December 2003, Ukraine and the Russian Federation agreed in a treaty to treat the sea and the Kerch Strait as shared internal waters.

In September 2018, Ukraine announced the intention to add navy ships and further ground forces along the coast of the Sea of Azov, with the ships based at Berdiansk. The military posturing was exacerbated following the construction of the Crimean Bridge, which is too low to allow passage of Panamax ships into Ukraine&#x27;s port. Late that September, two Ukrainian vessels departed from the Black Sea port Odesa, passed under the Crimean Bridge, and arrived in Mariupol. Tensions increased further after the Kerch Strait incident in November 2018, when Russia seized three Ukrainian Navy vessels attempting to enter the Sea of Azov.

Control of the western shore of the Sea is vital to the economy of Ukraine but it is also of immense strategic importance to Russia, as a land route to Crimea as well as it is for passage by Russian marine traffic.

On December 10, 2021, the Ukrainian Navy announced that Russia had blocked off nearly 70 percent of the Sea of Azov, issuing navigation warnings, ostensibly to conduct artillery fire exercises on the sea ...&quot;near Mariupol, Berdyansk and Henichesk.&quot; It raised apprehension regarding a potential Russian invasion since it had begun amassing tens of thousands of troops near the southeast Ukraine border and had begun a propaganda war against the Kyiv government. The Russians seized three Ukrainian military vessel as the boats were trying to cross the strait, and captured 24 sailors who were finally released after months of negotiations.

On February 24, 2022, Russian forces began shelling Mariupol at the start of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. By May, with the end of the siege of Mariupol, Russia fully captured the city and blocked off Ukraine&#x27;s access to the sea by controlling the entire north Pryazovia.

==Geology and bathymetry==

The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limit of the Sea of Azov in the Kertch Strait as &quot;The limit of the Black Sea&quot;, which is itself defined as &quot;A line joining Cape Takil and Cape Panaghia (45°02&#x27;N)&quot;.

The sea is considered an internal sea of Russia and Ukraine, and its use is governed by an agreement between these countries ratified in 2003.
The sea is long and wide and has an area of ; it is the smallest sea within the countries of the former Soviet Union. The main rivers flowing into it are the Don and Kuban; they ensure that the waters of the sea have comparatively low salinity and are almost fresh in places, and also bring in huge volumes of silt and sand. Accumulation of sand and shells results in a smooth and low coastline, as well as in numerous spits and sandbanks.

The Sea of Azov is the shallowest sea in the world with an average depth of and maximum depth of ; in the bays, where silt has built up, the average depth is about . The sea bottom is also relatively flat with the depth gradually increasing from the coast to the centre. The Sea of Azov is an internal sea with passage to the Atlantic Ocean going through the Black, Marmara, Aegean and Mediterranean seas. It is connected to the Black Sea by the Strait of Kerch, which at its narrowest has a width of and a maximum depth of . The narrowness of the Kerch Strait limits the water exchange with the Black Sea. As a result, the salinity of the Sea of Azov is low; in the open sea it is 10–12 on the Practical Salinity Scale (PSS), about one third of the salinity of the oceans; it is even lower (2–7 (PSS)) in the Taganrog Bay at the northeast end of the Sea. The long-term variations of salinity on the PSS are low, and are mostly caused by changes in humidity and precipitation.

Although more than 20 rivers flow into the sea, mostly from the north, two of them, the Don and Kuban rivers, account for more than 90% of water inflow. The contribution of the Don is about twice that of the Kuban. The Kuban delta is located at the southeast, on the east side of the Kerch Strait. It is over 100 km long and covers a vast flooded area with numerous channels. Because of the spread, the delta has low contrast in satellite images, and is hardly visible in the map. The Don flows from the north into the large Taganrog Bay. The depth there varies between 2 and 9 metres, while the maximum depth is observed in the middle of the sea.

Typical values of the annual inflow and outflow of water to the sea, averaged over the period from 1923 to 1985, are as follows: river inflow 38.6 km3, precipitation 15.5 km3, evaporation 34.6 km3, inflow from the Black Sea 36–38 km3, outflow 53–55 km3. Thus, about 17 km3 of fresh water is outflowing from the Azov Sea to the Black Sea. The depth of Azov Sea is decreasing, mostly due to the river-induced deposits. Whereas the past hydrological expeditions recorded depths of up to 16 metres, more recent ones could not find places deeper than 13.5–14 metres. This might explain the variation in the maximum depths among different sources. The water level fluctuates by some 20 cm over the year due to the snow melts in spring.

The Taman Peninsula has about 25 mud volcanoes, most of which are active. Their eruptions are usually quiet, spilling out mud, and such gases as methane, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide, but are sometimes violent and resemble regular volcanic eruptions. Some of those volcanoes are under water, near the shores of the peninsula. A major eruption on 6 September 1799, near Golubitskaya stanitsa, lasted about 2 hours and formed a mud island 100 metres in diameter and 2 metres in height; the island was then washed away by the sea. There were similar eruptions in 1862, 1906, 1924, 1950 and 1952.

The current vertical profile of the Sea of Azov exhibits oxygenated surface waters and anoxic bottom waters, with the anoxic waters forming in a layer in thickness. The occurrence of the anoxic layer is attributed to seasonal eutrophication events associated with increased sedimentary input from the Don and Kuban Rivers. This sedimentary input stimulates biotic activity in the surface layers, in which organisms photosynthesise under aerobic conditions. Once the organisms expire, the dead organic matter sinks to the bottom of the sea where bacteria and microorganisms, using all available oxygen, consume the organic matter, leading to anoxic conditions. Studies have shown that in the Sea of Azov, the exact vertical structure is dependent on wind strength and sea surface temperature, but typically a &#x27;stagnation zone&#x27; lies between the oxic and anoxic layers.

==Coastal features and major population centres==

Many rivers flowing into the Sea of Azov form bays, lagoons and limans. The sand, silt and shells they bring are deposited in the areas of reduced flow, that is the sides of the bays, forming narrow sandbanks called spits. Typical maximum depth in the bays and limans is a few metres. Because of shallow waters and abundant rivers, the spits are remarkably long and numerous in the sea – the Arabat Spit stretches over and is one of the world&#x27;s longest spits; three other spits, Fedotov Spit, Achuevsk Spit and Obitochna Spit, are longer than 30 km. Most spits stretch from north to south and their shape can significantly change over just several years.

A remarkable feature of the Sea of Azov is the large complex of shallow lagoons called Syvash or &quot;Rotten Sea&quot;. Their typical depth is only 0.5–1 metres with a maximum of 3 metres. They cover an area of in the northeastern Crimea which is separated from the sea by the Arabatsk Spit. North of the spit lies the city of Henichesk (population 22,500) and south of it is the Bay of Arabat. Syvash accepts up to 1.5 km3 of Azov water per year. Because of the lagoons&#x27; wide extent and shallowness, the water rapidly evaporates, resulting in the high salinity of 170 on the practical salinity scale. For this reason Syvash has long had an important salt-producing industry.
North of the Arabat Spit is the Molochnyi Liman with the associated Fedotov Spit (45 km long) which are formed by the Molochna River. Farther north, between the Fedotov Spit and Obytochna Spit (30 km long), lies Obytochny Bay. Further north, between Obytochna Spit and Berdyansk Spit (23 km long), is Berdyansk Bay with two cities, Berdyansk (population 112,000) and Primorsk (population 13,900). Further north again lies Belosaraysk Bay with Belosaraysk Spit, formed by the river Kalmius. The major city in the area is Mariupol (population 491,600). Then, approaching the Taganrog Bay and very close to Taganrog, are the Mius Liman and Krivaya Spit formed by the Mius River.

With an area of about , Taganrog Bay is the largest bay of the Sea of Azov. It is located in the north-eastern part of the Sea and is bounded by the Belosaraysk and Dolgaya Spits. The Don flows into it from the north-east. On its shores stand the two principal cities of the Sea of Azov, Taganrog (population 257,600) and Azov (population 83,200). South-east of the bay is Yeysk Liman. It lies entirely on the continent, entering the Taganrog Bay through the Yeysk and Glafirovsk Spits, and is the mouth of the Yeya River. Yeysk Spit is part of Yeysk city, which has a population of 87,500. It extends into the prominent Yeysk peninsula, which is tipped in the north-west by the Dolgaya Spit. South of it, also enclosed by the continent, lies Beisug Liman, which is restricted by the Yasensk Spit and is fed by the Beysug River. South-west of the liman, the 31 km long Achuevsk Spit runs along the coastline. Between the Achuevsk spit and Beisug Liman stands Primorsko-Akhtarsk with 32,165 inhabitants.
In the south, the Sea of Azov is connected to the Black Sea via the Strait of Kerch, which is bordered to the west by the Kerch peninsula of the Crimea and to the east by the Russian Taman peninsula in Krasnodar Krai. The city of Kerch (population 151,300) is located on the Kerch peninsula, and the Taman peninsula contains the delta of the Kuban, a major Russian river. The strait is 41 kilometres long and 4 to 15 kilometres wide. Its narrowest part lies on the Sea of Azov side, restricted by the Chushka Spit which faces southwards in consequence of the outflow from the Azov to the Black Sea.

The Strait of Kerch is spanned by the Crimean Bridge, which was opened in May 2018. This is a major geopolitical issue since shipping vessels over a certain size can not pass under the span. Since then Russia has been accused of interdicting shipping through the Kerch Strait.

==Hydrology==

==Climate==

The sea is relatively small and nearly surrounded by land. Therefore, its climate is continental with cold winters and hot and dry summers. In autumn and winter, the weather is affected by the Siberian Anticyclone which brings cold and dry air from Siberia with winds of 4–7 m/s, sometimes up to 15 m/s. Those winds may lower the winter temperatures from the usual −1 to −5 °C to below −30 °C. The mean mid-summer temperatures are 23–25 °C with a maximum of about 40 °C. Winds are weaker in summer, typically 3–5 m/s. Precipitation varies between 312 and 528 mm/year and is 1.5–2 times larger in summer than in winter.

Average water temperatures are 0–1 °C in winter (2–3 °C in the Kerch Strait) and 24–25 °C in summer, with a maximum of about 28 °C on the open sea and above 30 °C near the shores. During the summer, the sea surface is usually slightly warmer than the air. Because of the character of the sea, the temperature usually lowers by only about 1 °C with depth, but in cold winters, the difference can reach 5–7 °C.

The winds cause frequent storms, with the waves reaching 6 metres in the Taganrog Bay, 2–4 metres near the southern shores, and 1 metre in the Kerch Strait. In the open sea, their height is usually 1–2 metres, sometimes up to 3 metres. Winds also induce frequent seiches – standing waves with an amplitude of 20–50 cm and lasting from minutes to hours. Another consequence of the winds is water currents. The prevailing current is a counterclockwise due to the westerly and south-westerly winds. Their speed is typically less than 10 cm/s, but can reach 60–70 cm/s for 15–20 m/s winds. In the bays, the flow is largely controlled by the inflow of the rivers and is directed away from the shore. In the Kerch Strait, the flow is normally toward the Black Sea due to the predominance of northern winds and the water inflow from the rivers; its average speed is 10–20 cm/s, reaching 30–40 cm in the narrowest parts. Although the sea is not subject to tidal variation, there are seasonal changes in the observed sea level of up to , caused by seasonal variations in river outflows.
The shallowness and low salinity of the sea make it vulnerable to freezing during the winter. Fast ice bands ranging from 7 km in the north to 1.5 km in the south can occur temporarily at any time from late December to mid-March. Several ships were trapped in ice in 2012 when it froze over. The ice thickness reaches in most parts of the sea and 60–80 cm in the Taganrog Bay. The ice is often unstable and piles up to the height of several metres. Before the introduction of icebreakers, navigation was halted in the winter.

==Flora and fauna==
Historically, the sea has had rich marine life, both in variety, with over 80 fish and 300 invertebrate species identified, and in numbers. Consequently, fishing has long been a major activity in the area. The annual catch of recent years was 300,000 tonnes, about half of which are valuable species (sturgeon, pike-perch, bream, sea-roach, etc.). This was partly due to extremely high biological productivity of the sea, which was stimulated by the strong supply of nutrients from numerous rivers feeding the sea, low water salinity, ample heating due to shallow waters and long vegetation period. However, diversity and numbers have been reduced by artificial reduction of river flow (construction of dams), over-fishing and water-intense large-scale cultivation of cotton, causing increasing levels of pollution. Fish hauls have rapidly decreased and in particular anchovy fisheries have collapsed.

===Plankton and benthos===

Because of the shallow waters, the development of aquatic life in the Sea of Azov is more characteristic of a lagoon, and the plankton patterns are rather similar in the open sea and near the shores. Despite its shallowness, the water has low transparency, so bottom plants are poorly developed and most algae are of planktonic type. The sea is characterised by high concentrations of organic matter and long blooming periods. Another specific feature of the sea is the variable salinity – low in the large bays and higher in the open sea, especially near the Kerch Strait. Therefore, the plankton species are distributed inhomogeneously in the Sea of Azov. Although many additional species are brought in from the saltier Black Sea, most of them cannot adjust to the variable salinity of the Sea of Azov, except for the euryhaline species. About 600 species of planktonic algae are known in the Sea of Azov. The number of species is dominated by diatoms and green algae; blue-green algae and pyrophites are significant, and euglena and yellow-green algae form only 5% of the species. Green algae are mostly responsible for the colour of the sea in the satellite images (see photos above).

Regarding zooplankton, the fresh waters of the Tanganrog Bay are inhabited by cladocera, copepoda and rotifers, such as &quot;Brachionus plicatilis&quot;, &quot;Keratella curdata&quot; and &quot;Asplanchna&quot;. Western part of the sea, which is more saline, hosts three forms of &quot;Acartia clausi&quot;, as well as &quot;Centropages ponticus&quot;, meroplankton and larvae of gastropoda, bivalvia and polychaete.

Benthos species reside mostly at the sea bottom and include worms, crustaceans, bottom protists, coelenterata, and mollusks. Mollusks account for 60–98% of the invertebrate biomass at the Sea of Azov bottom.

===Fish===
There are 183 ichthyofauna species from 112 genera and 55 families in the Sea of Azov region. Among them, there are 50 rare and 19 endangered species, and the sturgeon &quot;Acipenser nudiventris&quot; is probably extinct in the region.

The fauna of the freshwater Taganrog Bay is much poorer – it consists of 55 species from 36 genera and 16 families; among them, three species are rare and 6 are endangered.

===Flora===

The shores of the Sea of Azov contain numerous estuaries and marshes and are dominated by reeds, sedges, &quot;Typha&quot; and &quot;Sparganium&quot;. Typical submerged plants are Charales, pond weed, hornworts and water lilies. Also common is sacred lotus. The number of species is large; for example, the Belosaraysk and Berdyansk spits alone contain more than 200 each. Some spits are declared national nature reserves, such as Beglitsk,
Belosaraysk, Krivaya and Berdyansk Spits.

===Fauna===

Estuaries and spits of the sea are rich in birds, mostly waterfowl, such as wild geese, ducks and seagulls. Colonies of cormorants and pelicans are common. Also frequently observed are swans, herons, sandpipers and many birds of prey. Mammals include foxes, wild cats, hares, hedgehogs, weasels, martens and wild boar. Muskrats were introduced to the area in the early 20th century and are hunted for their fur.

===Migrating and invading species===

Some ichthyofauna species, such as anchovy, garfish, Black Sea whiting and pickerel, visit the Sea of Azov from the Black Sea for spawning. This was especially frequent in 1975–77 when the salinity of the southern Sea of Azov was unusually high, and additional species were seen such as bluefish, turbot, chuco, spurdog, Black Sea salmon, mackerel and even corkwing wrasse, rock hopper, bullhead and eelpout. Unlike the Black Sea plankton which does not adapt well to the low salinity of the Sea of Azov and concentrates near the Kerch Strait, fishes and invertebrates of the Black Sea adjust well. They are often stronger than the native species, are used to the relatively low temperatures of the Black Sea and survive winter in the Sea of Azov well.

&quot;Balanus improvisus&quot; is the first benthos species which spread from the Black Sea in the early 20th century and settled in the Sea of Azov. Its current density is 7 kg/m2. From 1956, &quot;Rapana venosa&quot; is observed in the Sea of Azov, but it could not adjust to low salinity and therefore is limited to the neighborhood of the Kerch Strait. Several Sea of Azov mollusks, such as shipworm (&quot;Teredo navalis&quot;), soft-shell clam (&quot;Mya arernaria&quot;), Mediterranean mussel (&quot;Mytilus galloprovincialis&quot;) and &quot;Anadara inaequivalvis&quot;, originate from the Black Sea. Another example of invading species is the Dutch crab &quot;Rhithropanopeus harrisii&quot; which is observed both in saline and freshwater parts.

Formerly three types of dolphins, short-beaked common dolphin, common bottlenose dolphin and harbour porpoise, regularly visited the Sea of Azov from the Black Sea although the common dolphin usually avoided the basin and Kerch Strait due to low salinity. One sub-species of harbour porpoise, &quot;Phocoena phocoena relicta&quot;, used to live in the Sea of Azov and was therefore called &quot;Azov dolphin&quot; (, azovka) in the Soviet Union. Nowadays, dolphins are rarely observed in the Sea of Azov. This is attributed to shallowing of the sea, increasing navigation activities, pollution, and reduction in the fish population.

Various species of pinnipeds and belugas were introduced into Black Sea by mankind and later escaped either by accidental or purported causes. Of these, grey seal has been recorded within Kerch Strait and Sea of Azov. Mediterranean monk seals became extinct in the Black Sea in 1997, and the historic presence of large whales such as minke whales in the Black Sea is recorded, although it is unclear whether these mammals historically occurred in the Azov basin.

==Economy and ecology==
For centuries, the Sea of Azov has been an important waterway for the transport of goods and passengers. The first modern ironworks in Imperial Russia were located upstream on the Kalmius River at Donetsk, originally named &quot;Hughesovka&quot; (). It was also important for the transportation of iron ores from the mines of the Kerch peninsula to the processing plant of Azovstal in Mariupol (formerly Zhdanov), Ukraine; this activity stopped after the closure of the mines in the 1990s. Navigation increased after the construction in 1952 of the Volga–Don Canal which connected the Sea of Azov with the Volga River – the most important riverine transport route in the central Russia – thus connecting major cities such as Moscow, Volgograd and Astrakhan. Currently, the major ports are in Taganrog, Mariupol, Yeysk and Berdyansk.

Increasing navigation rates have resulted in more pollution and even in ecological disasters. On 11 November 2007, a strong storm sank four ships in the Kerch Strait, in the Russian Port of Kavkaz. The ships were the Russian bulk carriers &quot;Volnogorsk&quot;; &quot;Nakhichevan&quot;; and &quot;Kovel&quot;, and the Georgian &quot;Haji Izmail&quot; with a Turkish crew. Six other ships were driven from their anchors and grounded. The tanker was broken in two, and the tanker &quot;Volgoneft-123&quot; was damaged. As a result, about 1,300 tons of fuel oil and about 6,800 tons of sulfur entered the sea.

Another traditional activity in the sea is fishing. The Sea of Azov used to be the most productive fishing area in the Soviet Union: typical annual fish catches of 300,000 tonnes converted to 80 kg per hectare of surface. (The corresponding numbers are 2 kg in the Black Sea and in the Mediterranean Sea.) The catch has decreased in the 21st century, with more emphasis now on fish farming, especially of sturgeon.

Traditionally much of the coastline has been a zone of health resorts.

The irrigation system of the Taman Peninsula, supplied by the extended delta of the Kuban River, is favorable for agriculture and the region is famous for its vines. The area of the Syvash lagoons and Arabat Spit was traditionally a centre of a salt-producing industry. The Arabat Spit alone produced about 24,000 tonnes/year in the 19th century.

<doc id="78022" wikidata="Q795989" url="?curid=78022" title="BINAC">
<text>BINAC (Binary Automatic Computer) is an early electronic computer that was designed for Northrop Aircraft Company by the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation (EMCC) in 1949. Eckert and Mauchly had started the design of EDVAC at the University of Pennsylvania, but chose to leave and start EMCC, the first computer company. BINAC was their first product, the first stored-program computer in the United States; BINAC is also sometimes claimed to be the world&#x27;s first commercial digital computer even though it was limited in scope and never fully functional after delivery.

==Architecture==

The BINAC was a bit-serial binary computer with two independent CPUs, each with its own 512-word acoustic mercury delay-line memory. The CPUs continuously compared results to check for errors caused by hardware failures. It used approximately 700 vacuum tubes. The 512-word acoustic mercury delay-line memories were divided into 16 channels, each holding 32 words of 31 bits, with an additional 11-bit space between words to allow for circuit delays in switching. The clock rate was 4.25 MHz (1 MHz according to one source), which yielded a word access time of about 10 microseconds. The addition time was 800 microseconds, and the multiplication time was 1200 microseconds. Programs or data were entered manually in octal using an eight-key keypad or were loaded from magnetic tape. BINAC was significant for being able to perform high-speed arithmetic on binary numbers, with no provisions to store characters or decimal digits.

==Project and plan==
In early 1946, months after the completion of ENIAC, the University of Pennsylvania adopted a new patent policy, which would have required Eckert and Mauchly to assign all their patents to the university if they stayed beyond spring of that year. Unable to reach an agreement with the university, the duo left the Moore School of Electrical Engineering in March 1946, along with much of the senior engineering staff. Simultaneously, the duo founded the Electronic Control Company (later renamed the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation) in Philadelphia, to create electronic stored-program computers on a commercial basis. Later in October 1947, needing money to keep their business afloat while working on the UNIVAC I (which was also in development at the time) for the United States Census Bureau, the duo drafted a contract with Northrop Aircraft to build a new computer, which became the BINAC. The company quickly signed it and simultaneously ordered one, as they were engaged in a project to build a long-range guided missile for the U.S. Air Force, and had the idea of using electronic computers for airborne navigation.
By September 1948, the second module for the computer was complete in the newly renamed Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation, which included germanium diodes – the first application of semiconductors in computers – for the logic-processing hardware. As test programs were being run in early 1949, the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation made an operating and maintenance manual on the computer, specifically for the Northrop Aircraft Corporation. Construction on the computer was complete in August of that year. That same month, the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation issued a press release describing the sale of the BINAC, which was the first press release ever issued for the sale of an electronic computer.

==Early test programs==
The BINAC ran a test program (consisting of 23 instructions) in March 1949, although it was not fully functional at the time. Here are early test programs that BINAC ran:

* February 7, 1949 – Ran a five-line program to fill the memory from register A.
* February 10, 1949 – Ran a five-line program to check memory.
* February 16, 1949 – Ran a six-line program to fill memory.
* March 7, 1949 – Ran 217 iterations of a 23-line program to compute squares. It was still running correctly when it stopped.
* April 4, 1949 – Ran a fifty-line program to fill memory and check all instructions. It ran for 2.5 hours before encountering an error. Shortly after that it ran for 31.5 hours without error.

==Customer acceptance==
Northrop accepted delivery of BINAC in September 1949. Northrop employees said that BINAC never worked properly after it was delivered, although it had worked at the Eckert-Mauchly workshop. It was able to run some small programs but did not work well enough to be used as a production machine. Northrop attributed the failures to it not being properly packed for shipping when Northrop picked it up; EMCC said that the problems were due to errors in re-assembly of the machine after shipping. Northrop, citing security considerations, refused to allow EMCC technicians near the machine after shipping, instead hiring a newly graduated engineering student to re-assemble it. EMCC said that the fact that it worked at all after this was testimony to the engineering quality of the machine.

==First computer user manual==
Previous computers were the darlings of university departments of engineering; the users knew the machines well. The BINAC was going to go to an end user, and so a &quot;user&quot; manual was needed. Automobile &quot;users&quot; were quite accustomed in those days to doing significant servicing of their vehicles, and &quot;user manuals&quot; existed to help them. The BINAC manual writers took inspiration from those manuals when writing the user manual for the BINAC.

<text>The Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) is a collegiate athletic conference in the United States. Headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, the ACC&#x27;s eighteen member universities compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)&#x27;s Division I. ACC football teams compete in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision. The ACC sponsors competition in twenty-eight sports with many of its member institutions held in high regard nationally. Current members of the conference are: Boston College, California, Clemson, Duke, Florida State, Georgia Tech, Louisville, Miami, North Carolina, NC State, Notre Dame, Pittsburgh, SMU, Stanford, Syracuse, Virginia, Virginia Tech, and Wake Forest.

ACC teams and athletes have claimed dozens of national championships in multiple sports throughout the conference&#x27;s history. Generally, the ACC&#x27;s top athletes and teams in any particular sport in a given year are considered to be among the top collegiate competitors in the nation. Additionally, the conference enjoys extensive media coverage. With the advent of the College Football Playoff in 2014, the ACC is one of the &quot;Power Four&quot; conferences who had contractual tie-in to a New Year&#x27;s Six bowl game in the sport of football prior to the playoffs being expanded in 2024.

The ACC was founded on May 8, 1953, by seven universities located in the South Atlantic States, with the University of Virginia joining in early December 1953 to bring the membership to eight. The loss of South Carolina in 1971 dropped membership to seven, while the addition of Georgia Tech in 1979 for non-football sports and 1983 for football brought it back to eight, and Florida State&#x27;s arrival in 1991 for non-football sports and 1992 for football increased the membership to nine. Since 2000, with the widespread reorganization of the NCAA, ten additional schools have joined, and one original member (Maryland) has left to bring it to the current membership of 18 schools. The additions in recent years extended the conference&#x27;s footprint into the Northeast, Midwest, and West.

==Member universities==

===Full members===
The ACC has 18 member institutions from 12 states. Listed in alphabetical order, these 12 states within the ACC&#x27;s geographical footprint are California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia. The geographic domain of the conference is predominantly within the Southern and Northeastern United States along the US Atlantic coast, but recent conference realignment has brought it to California and Texas. It stretches from Florida in the south to New York in the north and from California in the west to Massachusetts farthest east.

When Notre Dame joined the ACC, it chose to remain a football independent. However, its football team established a special scheduling arrangement with the ACC to play a rotating selection of five ACC football teams per season. For the 2020 season, due largely to the suspension of most non-conference games by other Power Five conferences due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, the ACC reached an agreement to allow Notre Dame to play a full, 10-game conference schedule and be eligible to play for the ACC championship.

Since August 2, 2024, the 18 members of the ACC are:

===Former members===
In 1971, the University of South Carolina left the ACC to become an independent, later joining the Metro Conference in 1983 and moving to its current home, the Southeastern Conference, in 1991. On July 1, 2014, the University of Maryland departed for the Big Ten Conference.

==History==

===Founding and early expansion===
The ACC was established on June 14, 1953, when seven members of the Southern Conference left to form their own conference. These seven universities became charter members of the ACC: Clemson, Duke, Maryland, North Carolina, North Carolina State, South Carolina, and Wake Forest. They left partially due to the Southern Conference&#x27;s ban on post-season football play that had been initiated in 1951. (Clemson and Maryland had both defied the Southern Conference&#x27;s bowl rule following the 1951 season and were banned from playing other conference teams in the 1952 season.) After drafting a set of bylaws for the creation of a new league, the seven withdrew from the Southern Conference at the spring meeting on the morning of May 8, 1953, at the Sedgefield Country Club in Greensboro, North Carolina. The bylaws were ratified on June 14, 1953, and the new conference was created. The conference officials indicated a desire to add an eighth member, and candidates mentioned were Virginia, VPI and West Virginia. On December 4, 1953, officials convened in Greensboro, North Carolina, and admitted Virginia, a former Southern Conference charter member that had been independent since 1937, into the conference. Virginia&#x27;s president Colgate Darden argued fiercely against joining the ACC or any conference, while UVA athletics director Gus Tebell argued in favor. In the end, UVA&#x27;s Board of Visitors approved joining the ACC by a vote of 6–3.

In 1960, the ACC implemented a minimum SAT score for incoming student-athletes of 750, the first conference to do so. This minimum was raised to 800 in 1964, but was ultimately struck down by a federal court in 1972.

On July 1, 1971, South Carolina left the ACC to become an independent.

====Racial integration====
Racial integration of all-white collegiate sports teams was high on the regional agenda in the 1950s and 1960s. Involved were issues of equality, racism, and the alumni demand for the top players needed to win high-profile games. The ACC took the lead. First they started to schedule integrated teams from the north. Finally ACC schools—typically under pressure from boosters and civil rights groups—integrated their teams. With an alumni base that dominated local and state politics, society and business, the ACC flagship schools were successful in their endeavor—as Pamela Grundy argues, they had learned how to win:
: The widespread admiration that athletic ability inspired would help transform athletic fields from grounds of symbolic play to forces for social change, places where a wide range of citizens could publicly and at times effectively challenge the assumptions that cast them as unworthy of full participation in U.S. society. While athletic successes would not rid society of prejudice or stereotype—black athletes would continue to confront racial slurs...[—minority star players demonstrated] the discipline, intelligence, and poise to contend for position or influence in every arena of national life.

====1978 and 1991 expansions====
The ACC operated with seven members until the addition of Georgia Tech from the Metro Conference, announced on April 3, 1978, and taking effect on July 1, 1979, except in football, in which Tech would remain an independent until joining ACC football in 1983. The total number of member schools reached nine with the addition of Florida State, also formerly from the Metro Conference, on July 1, 1991, in non-football sports and July 1, 1992, in football. The additions of those schools marked the first expansions of the conference footprint since 1953, though both schools were still located with the rest of the ACC schools in the South Atlantic States.

====2004–2005 expansion====

The ACC added three members from the Big East Conference during the 2005 conference realignment. Initially, the conference targeted Boston College, Miami, and Syracuse. The expansion was controversial, as Connecticut, Rutgers, Pittsburgh, and West Virginia (and, initially, Virginia Tech) filed lawsuits against the ACC, Miami, and Boston College for allegedly conspiring to weaken the Big East Conference. Then-Virginia governor Mark Warner, who feared Virginia Tech being left behind in a weakened Big East, pressured the administration of the University of Virginia to lobby on behalf of their in-state foe. Eventually Virginia Tech replaced Syracuse in the expansion lineup and ACC expansion was agreed upon. Miami and Virginia Tech joined on July 1, 2004, while Boston College joined on July 1, 2005, as the league&#x27;s twelfth member and the first from the Northeast.

===2010–present===
==== 2010–2022 ====
The ACC Hall of Champions opened on March 2, 2011, next to the Greensboro Coliseum arena, making the ACC the second college sports conference to have a hall of fame after the Southern Conference.

On September 17, 2011, Big East Conference members Syracuse University and the University of Pittsburgh both applied to join the ACC. The two schools were accepted into the conference the following day, once again expanding the conference footprint like previous expansions. Because the Big East intended to hold Pitt and Syracuse to the 27-month notice period required by league bylaws, the most likely entry date into the ACC (barring negotiations) was July 1, 2014. However, in July 2012, the Big East came to an agreement with Syracuse and Pitt that allowed the two schools to leave the Big East on July 1, 2013.

On September 12, 2012, Notre Dame agreed to join the ACC in all conference sports except football and men&#x27;s ice hockey (as the ACC does not sponsor men&#x27;s ice hockey; of all other ACC universities, only Boston College sponsors men&#x27;s ice hockey) as the conference&#x27;s first member in the Midwestern United States. As part of the agreement, Notre Dame committed to play five football games each season against ACC schools beginning in 2014. On March 12, 2013, Notre Dame and the Big East announced they had reached a settlement allowing Notre Dame to join the ACC effective July 1, 2013.

On November 19, 2012, the University of Maryland&#x27;s Board of Regents voted to withdraw from the ACC to join the Big Ten Conference effective in 2014. The following week, the Big East&#x27;s University of Louisville accepted the ACC&#x27;s invitation to become a full member, replacing Maryland effective July 1, 2014.

The ACC&#x27;s presidents announced on April 22, 2013, that all 15 schools that would be members of the conference in 2014–15 had signed a grant of media rights (GOR), effective immediately and running through the 2026–27 school year, coinciding with the duration of the conference&#x27;s then-current TV deal with ESPN. This move essentially prevents the ACC from being a target for other conferences seeking to expand—under the grant, if a school leaves the conference during the contract period, all revenue derived from that school&#x27;s media rights for home games would belong to the ACC and not the school. The move also left the SEC as the only one of the FBS Power Five conferences without a GOR.

In July 2016, the GOR was extended through the 2035–36 school year, coinciding with the signing of a new 20-year deal with ESPN that would transform the then-current ad hoc ACC Network into a full-fledged network. The new network launched as a digital service in the 2016–17 school year and as a linear network in August 2019.

On August 24, 2021, the ACC formed an alliance with the Big Ten and Pac-12 conferences. In 2022, the ACC brought back old rivalries like the Backyard Brawl between the University of Pittsburgh Panthers and the West Virginia University Mountaineers. A friendly rivalry between University of Pittsburgh Panthers and Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets in memory of the 1956 Sugar Bowl and Bobby Grier, during the last game, actor Anthony Mackie appeared on field to honor Grier and the game.

==== 2024 expansion ====

On September 1, 2023, the conference voted to expand and add three new members: California, SMU, and Stanford. The announcement was initially controversial, given the distance between the schools and its current members. SMU joined on July 1, 2024, from the American Athletic Conference, while Cal and Stanford joined the ACC on August 2, 2024, due to the fiscal year of the Pac-12 Conference, their former conference, being different from most athletic conferences.

==Academics and ACC==

===Academic rankings===
Among the major NCAA athletic conferences that sponsor NCAA Division I FBS football, including the current &quot;power conferences&quot;, the ACC has been regarded as having the highest academically ranked collection of members based on &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; and by the NCAA&#x27;s Academic Progress Rate.

Nine ACC institutions are members of the Association of American Universities: Cal, Duke, Georgia Tech, Miami, Notre Dame, Pittsburgh, North Carolina, Stanford, and Virginia. Syracuse was a member until 2011 but voluntarily withdrew over a dispute on how to count non-federal grants.

===ACCAC and ACC academic network===

The members of the ACC participate in the Atlantic Coast Conference Academic Consortium (ACCAC), a consortium that provides a vehicle for inter-institutional academic and administrative collaboration between member universities. Growing out of a conference-wide doctoral student-exchange program that was established in 1999, the ACCAC has expanded its scope into other domestic and international collaborations.

The stated mission of the ACCAC is to &quot;leverage the athletic associations and identities among the 15 ACC universities in order to enrich the educational missions of member universities.&quot; To that end, the collaborative helps organize various academic initiatives, including fellowship and scholarship programs, global research initiatives, leadership conferences, and extensive study abroad programs. Funding for its operations, 90% of which is spent on direct student support, is derived from a portion of the income generated by the ACC Football Championship Game and by supplemental allocations by individual universities and various grants.

===ACCAC academic programs===
Major academic programs that have been implemented under ACCAC include:
* The annual Meeting of the Minds (MOM) undergraduate research conference.
* The annual Student Leadership Conference.
* The Creativity and Innovation Fellowship Program in which each university receives $12,500 to award between two and five undergraduate students ACCAC fellowships for research or creative projects.
* The Summer Research Scholars Program in which every ACC university will receive $5,000 to support up to two of its undergraduate students in conducting research in residence at another ACC university during a minimum 10-week period over the summer.
* The ACC Debate Championship
* The ACC Inventure Prize Competition is a Shark Tank-like innovation competition for teams of students from ACC universities.
* The Student Federal Relations Trip to Washington, D.C. is an annual trip of student delegates from ACC universities to the nation&#x27;s capital.
* The Creativity Competition is planned to be an ACC-wide, team-based interdisciplinary competition emphasizing use of creative design and the arts to begin in 2017.
* The Distinguished Lecturers Program in which five ACC universities select an outstanding faculty member as The ACCAC&#x27;s Distinguished Lecturer. In addition to an award stipend, the ACCAC provides financial support to enable each ACC university to sponsor a &quot;distinguished lecture event&quot; on their campus.
* The Executive Leadership Series is a two-day skill enhancement programs designed for Deans, Vice Provosts, and Vice Chancellors of ACC universities.
* The annual Student President Conference.
* The Coach for College Program, primarily for student-athletes and run through Duke University with support from the ACCAC, that takes 32 ACC students to Vietnam for three weeks in the summer to coach hundreds of middle school children.
* The Traveling Scholars Program which allows PhD candidates from one ACC campus to access courses, laboratories, library, or other resources at any one of the other ACC member institution campuses.
* The Clean Energy Grant Competition that helps coordinate geographically defined clusters of ACC universities in competition for United States Department of Energy Clean Energy Grants.
* The Study Abroad Program collaborative which allows cross-registration in study abroad programs enroll in programs sponsored by an ACC university other than their &quot;home&quot; university. A Student Study Abroad Scholarship program that awarded two to five ACCAC scholarships for study abroad was discontinued in 2013, but is targeted for renewal in 2014–15.

The ACCAC also supports periodic meetings among faculty, administration, and staff who pursue similar interests and responsibilities at the member universities either by face-to-face conferences, video conferences, or telephone conferences. ACCAC affinity groups include those for International Affairs Officers, Study Abroad Directors, Teaching-Learning Center Directors, Chief Information Officers, Chief Procurement Officers, Undergraduate Research Conference Coordinators, Student Affairs Vice Presidents, Student Leadership Conference Coordinators, and Faculty Athletic Representatives To the ACC.

==Athletic department revenue by school==
Total revenue includes ticket sales, contributions and donations, rights and licensing, student fees, school funds and all other sources including TV income, camp income, concessions, and novelties.

Total expenses includes coach and staff salaries, scholarships, buildings and grounds, maintenance, utilities and rental fees, recruiting, team travel, equipment and uniforms, conference dues, and insurance.

==Facilities==

==Apparel==

==Sports==
The Atlantic Coast Conference sponsors championship competition in thirteen men&#x27;s and fifteen women&#x27;s NCAA-sanctioned sports. The most recently added sports are women&#x27;s gymnastics and fencing. Gymnastics was added for the 2023–24 school year with Clemson, North Carolina, North Carolina State, and Pitt participating. Fencing was added for the 2014–15 school year after having been absent from the conference since 1980; Boston College, Duke, North Carolina, and Notre Dame participate in that sport.

Since all current ACC members (including non-football member Notre Dame) field FBS football teams, they are subject to the NCAA requirement that FBS schools field at least 16 teams in NCAA-recognized varsity sports. However, the ACC itself requires sponsorship of only four sports—football, men&#x27;s basketball, women&#x27;s basketball, and either women&#x27;s soccer or women&#x27;s volleyball. All ACC members sponsor all five of the named sports except Georgia Tech, which sponsors women&#x27;s volleyball but not women&#x27;s soccer.

===Men&#x27;s sponsored sports by school===
Member-by-member sponsorship of the 13 men&#x27;s ACC sports for the 2024–25 academic year.


===Women&#x27;s sponsored sports by school===
Member-by-member sponsorship of the 15 women&#x27;s ACC sports for the 2024–25 academic year. The ACC began sponsoring women&#x27;s gymnastics in 2023–24.

===Current champions===


==Football==

The ACC is considered to be one of the Power Four conferences, all of which receive automatic placement of their football champions into one of the six major bowl games. Seven of its members claim football national championships in their history, with two having won the now-defunct Bowl Championship Series (BCS) during its existence between 1998 and 2014 and one having won under the current College Football Playoff (CFP) system. Five of its members are among the top 25 of college football&#x27;s all-time winningest programs. Three ACC teams, Florida State, Miami, and Clemson, are listed in the top 10 of most successful football programs since 2000.

===Divisions and scheduling===
In 2005, the ACC began divisional play in football. At the time, the ACC was the only NCAA Division I conference whose divisions were not divided geographically (e.g., north–south, East/West), but rather into Atlantic and Coastal (this arrangement continues today for the sports of baseball and men&#x27;s soccer). The two division leaders then competed in the ACC Championship Game to determine the conference championship, which guarantees a berth in a New Year&#x27;s Six bowl game. The inaugural Championship Game was played on December 3, 2005, in Jacksonville, Florida, at the venue then known as Alltel Stadium, in which Florida State defeated Virginia Tech to capture its 12th championship since it joined the league in 1992. Notre Dame began playing several ACC teams each year in 2014, but is not considered a football member and is not eligible to play in the ACC Championship Game.

On June 28, 2022, the ACC approved a new football schedule format, set to take effect in the 2023 season. Under this format, the conference will remove divisions, and instead play a 3–5–5 format, where each team plays 3 designated rivals every year along with two separate 5-team rotations that flip every other year, such that every team will have at least one home game and one away game against every other team in a four-year cycle (the standard length of a college player&#x27;s career). Participation in the ACC championship game will also no longer be determined by the winners of the two divisions; the two teams with the highest conference winning percentage will play instead. The designated rivals under this system were as follows:

With the 2024 arrival of California, SMU, and Stanford, the ACC adopted a new scheduling model effective that season and running through the 2030 season. A total of 16 matchups will be protected, with 11 retained from the 2023 model, two (Miami–Virginia Tech and NC State–Wake Forest) restored from the former divisional format, and the three new members filling the remaining three slots. All teams will play each other at least twice in the cycle (once home, once away). Each of the pre-2024 members will play three times in California during the cycle, and none will travel to California in back-to-back seasons.

Additionally, this allows for each team to schedule four non-conference games. Since the 2014 season, one of the four non-conference games is against Notre Dame every two to three years, as Notre Dame plays against five ACC opponents in non-conference games each season. ACC members are also required to play at least one non-conference game each season against a team in the &quot;Power 5&quot; conferences since 2017. Games against Notre Dame also meet the requirement. In January 2015, the conference announced that games against another FBS independent, BYU, would also count toward the requirement. This requirement can also be met by scheduling other ACC teams in non-conference games; the first example of this was also announced in January 2015, when North Carolina and Wake Forest announced that they would play a home-and-home non-conference series in 2019 and 2021.

Prior to this, the division format was as follows:

* Six games within its division (three home, three away, one against each opponent).
* One game against a designated &quot;permanent rival&quot; from the other division (not necessarily the school&#x27;s closest traditional rival, even within the conference), similar to the SEC setup.
**The permanent cross-division matchups are as follows, with the Atlantic Division member listed first: Boston College–Virginia Tech; Clemson–Georgia Tech; Duke–Wake Forest; Florida State–Miami; Louisville–Virginia; NC State–North Carolina; Syracuse–Pittsburgh.
* One rotating game against a team in the other division, for a total of two cross-division games.
**Non-permanent cross-division opponents face each other in the regular season twice in a span of twelve years.
**Prior to the addition of Syracuse and Pittsburgh in 2013, teams played two rotating cross-division games (for a total of three cross-division games), with a total of eight conference games. The addition of one team to each division meant the loss of one cross-division game per year.

For the 2020 season, changes were made to the football schedule model due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of divisions was suspended, with conference games being scheduled on a regional basis. The top two teams by winning percentage against conference opponents advanced to the ACC Championship Game. All teams played 10 conference games and were permitted to play one non-conference game of their choice as long as the game was played in-state. In addition, Notre Dame played an ACC conference schedule and was eligible to (and ultimately did) play in the ACC Championship Game.

===Bowl games===
Within the College Football Playoff, the Orange Bowl serves as the home of the ACC champion against Notre Dame or another team from the SEC or Big Ten. If the conference&#x27;s champion is selected for the CFP, another ACC team will be chosen in its place.

The other bowls pick ACC teams in the order set by agreements between the conference and the bowls.

Beginning in 2014, Notre Dame is eligible for selection as the ACC&#x27;s representative to any of its contracted bowl games. The ACC&#x27;s bowl selection will no longer be bound by the rigidity of a &quot;one-win rule&quot; but will have a general list of criteria to emphasize regionality and quality matchups on the field. A one-win rule does apply to Notre Dame&#x27;s participation in the ACC Bowl structure. Notre Dame is now eligible for ACC Bowl selection beginning with the ReliaQuest Bowl (previously named the Outback Bowl) and continuing through the league&#x27;s bowl selections. However, Notre Dame must be within one win of the ACC available team which has the best overall record, in order to be chosen. In other words, if an ACC team were 9–3, a 7–5 Notre Dame team could not be chosen in its place. Notre Dame would have to be 8–4 to be chosen over a 9–3 league team. For the 2020 season only, Notre Dame competed for the ACC conference championship and was eligible for all games, including the Orange Bowl.


===National championships===
Although the NCAA does not determine an official national champion for Division I FBS football, several ACC members claim national championships awarded by various &quot;major selectors&quot; of national championships as recognized in the official &quot;NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision Records&quot;. Since 1936 and 1950 respectively, these include what are now the most pervasive and influential selectors, the Associated Press poll and Coaches Poll. In addition, from 1998 to 2013 the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) used a mathematical formula to match the top two teams at the end of the season. The winner of the BCS was contractually awarded the Coaches&#x27; Poll national championship and its AFCA National Championship Trophy as well as the MacArthur Trophy from the National Football Foundation. Maryland won one championship as a member of the ACC in 1953.
* &quot;Italics&quot; denote championships won before the school joined the ACC.
* In addition, non-football member Notre Dame claims 11 national titles. Many sources, however, credit the Fighting Irish with 13. See Notre Dame Fighting Irish football national championships for more details.


===Intra-conference football rivalries===
The members of the ACC have longstanding rivalries with each other, especially on the football field. The following is a list of active rivalries and protected annual matchups in the ACC with totals &amp; records through the completion of the 2024 season.

===Interconference football rivalries===
Notre Dame is a non-football member of the ACC, but has several rivalries with ACC members.

==Basketball==
===History===
The early roots of ACC basketball began primarily thanks to two men: Everett Case and Frank McGuire.
Case accepted the head coaching job at North Carolina State. Case&#x27;s North Carolina State teams dominated the early years of the ACC with a modern, fast-paced style of play. He became the fastest college basketball coach to reach many &quot;games won&quot; milestones.
Case became known as &quot;The Father of ACC Basketball.&quot; Despite his success on the court, he may have been even a better promoter off-the-court. Case realized the need to sell his program and university. State started construction on Reynolds Coliseum in 1941. Case persuaded school officials to expand the arena to 12,400 people. It opened as the new home court for his team in 1949; at the time, it was the largest on-campus arena in the South. As such, it was used as the host site for many Southern Conference tournaments, ACC tournaments, and the &quot;Dixie Classic&quot;. The Dixie Classic brought in large revenues for all schools involved and soon became one of the premier sporting events in the South.

Partly to counter Case&#x27;s success, North Carolina convinced Frank McGuire to come to Chapel Hill in 1952. McGuire knew that, largely due to Case&#x27;s influence, basketball was now the major high school athletic event of the region. He not only tapped the growing market of high school talent in North Carolina, but also brought several recruits from his home territory in New York City as well. Case and McGuire literally &quot;invented&quot; a rivalry. Both men realized the benefits created through a rivalry between them. It brought more national attention to both of their programs and increased fan support on both sides.

After State was slapped with crippling NCAA sanctions before the 1956–57 season, McGuire&#x27;s North Carolina team delivered the ACC its first national championship. During the Tar Heels&#x27; championship run, Greensboro entrepreneur Castleman D. Chesley noticed the popularity that it generated. He cobbled together a five-station television network to broadcast the Final Four. That network began broadcasting regular season ACC games the following season—the ancestor of the television package from Raycom Sports. From that point on, ACC basketball gained large popularity.

The ACC has been the home of many prominent basketball coaches besides Case and McGuire, including Terry Holland and Tony Bennett of Virginia; Vic Bubas and Mike Krzyzewski of Duke; Press Maravich, Norm Sloan and Jim Valvano of North Carolina State; Dean Smith and Roy Williams of North Carolina; Bones McKinney and Dave Odom of Wake Forest; Lefty Driesell and Gary Williams of Maryland; Bobby Cremins of Georgia Tech; Jim Boeheim of Syracuse; Jim Larrañaga of Miami; and Rick Pitino of Louisville.

===Tournament as championship===
Possibly Case&#x27;s most lasting contribution is the ACC tournament, which was first played in 1954 and decides the winner of the ACC title. The ACC is unique in that it is the only Division I college basketball conference that does not recognize a regular season champion. This started when only one school per conference made the NCAA tournament. The ACC representative was determined by conference tournament rather than the regular season result. Therefore, the league eliminated the regular season title in 1961, choosing to recognize only the winner of the ACC tournament as conference champion. Fans and media do claim a regular-season title for the team that finishes first, and the NCAA recognizes a regular-season title winner in order to maintain its system of choosing NIT and NCAA tournament berths based on regular season placement. For the ACC, recognition of a regular season champion is insignificant as a 1975 NCAA rule change allowed more than one team per conference to earn a bid to the NCAA tournament. As a result, the team finishing atop the ACC regular-season standings has invariably been invited to the NCAA tournament even if it did not win the ACC Tournament. Even so, any claim to a regular season &quot;title&quot; remains unofficial and carries no reward other than top seed in the ACC tournament.

Historically, the ACC has been dominated by the four teams from Tobacco Road in North Carolina—North Carolina, Duke, North Carolina State and Wake Forest. Between them, they have won 50 tournament titles. They have also won or shared 59 regular season titles, including all but four since 1981. The Virginia Cavaliers, however, won the regular season titles in 2014 and 2015, becoming the first ACC team besides Duke or North Carolina to solely win back-to-back regular season titles since NC State was undefeated in conference play in 1972–73 and 1973–74. NC State also was undefeated in the ACC Tournament during those two seasons.

===Present-day schedule===

For 53 years, the ACC employed a double round-robin schedule in the regular season, in which each team played the others twice a season. With the expansion to 12 members by the 2005–2006 season, the ACC schedule could no longer accommodate this format. In the new scheduling format that was agreed to, each team was assigned two permanent partners and nine rotating partners over a three-year period. Teams played their permanent partners in a home-and-away series each year. The rotating partners were split into three groups: three teams played in a home-and-away series, three teams played at home, and three teams played on the road. The rotating partner groups were rotated so that a team would play each permanent partner six times, and each rotating partner four times, over a three-year period.

For the 2012–13 season, the 12-team in-conference schedule expanded to 18. Originally for the 2013–14 season, the expanded 14-team, 18-game schedule was to consist of a home and away game with a &quot;primary partner&quot; while the remaining conference opponents would have rotated in groups of three: one year both home and away, one year at home only, and one year away only. However, when Notre Dame was also added for the 2013–14 season, the now 15-team, 18-game schedule was modified so each school played two &quot;Partners&quot; home and away annually, two home and away, five home, and the other five away. In 2013–14, after 1 year at 18 games, women&#x27;s basketball went back to a 16-game schedule where each team only plays 2 teams twice, rotating opponents each year over seven years and has no permanent partners. In 2019–2020, with the launch of the ACC Network, the men&#x27;s schedule expanded to 20 games and the women&#x27;s schedule expanded to 18 games.

The ACC and the Big Ten Conference have held the ACC–Big Ten Challenge each season since 1999. The competition is a series of regular-season games pitting ACC and Big Ten teams against each other. Each team typically plays one Challenge game each season, except for a few teams from the larger conference that are left out due to unequal conference sizes. The first ACC–Big Ten Women&#x27;s Challenge was played in 2007, and has the same format as the men&#x27;s Challenge.

===National championships and Final Fours===
Over the course of its existence, ACC schools have captured 15 NCAA men&#x27;s basketball championships while members of the conference. North Carolina has won six, Duke has won five, NC State has won two, and Maryland and Virginia have each won one. Four more national titles were won by current ACC members while in other conferences—three by 2014 arrival Louisville and one by 2013 arrival Syracuse; Louisville was forced to vacate the third national title due to NCAA sanctions. Seven of the 12 pre-2013 members have advanced to the Final Four at least once while members of the ACC. Another pre-2013 member, Florida State, made the Final Four once before joining the ACC. All three schools that entered the ACC in 2013, as well as Louisville, advanced to the Final Four at least once before joining the conference. Two of the three schools that joined in 2024, Bay Area rivals California and Stanford, have each won one NCAA title.

Also notable are earlier national championships from historical eras prior to the dominance of the NCAA-administered championship. The ACC is often credited with forcing the NCAA tournament to expand to allow more than one team per conference, creating the at-large NCAA field common today. The Helms Athletic Foundation selected national champions for seasons predating the beginning of the NCAA tournament (1939), including North Carolina, Notre Dame, Pitt, Stanford, and Syracuse. Prior to the at-large era (1975), the National Invitation Tournament championship had prestige comparable to the NCAA championship, and Louisville, North Carolina, Maryland, and Virginia Tech won titles during this period (later NIT titles are not considered consensus national championships).

In women&#x27;s basketball, ACC members have won three national championships while in the conference, North Carolina in 1994, Maryland in 2006, and Notre Dame in 2018. Notre Dame, which joined in 2013, also previously won the national title in 2001. In 2006, Duke, Maryland, and North Carolina all advanced to the Final Four, the first time a conference placed three teams in the women&#x27;s Final Four. Both finalists were from the ACC, with Maryland defeating Duke for the title. One of the newest members, Stanford, won three national titles before joining the ACC (1990, 1992, 2021).
&quot;Italics denotes honors earned before the school joined the ACC.&quot; Women&#x27;s national championship tournaments prior to 1982 were run by the AIAW.

==Baseball==
With the ACC having abandoned football divisions in 2023, baseball is one of only two ACC-sponsored sports with a divisional split (Atlantic and Coastal), with men&#x27;s soccer being the other. The alignment is shown below:
These divisions paralleled the former divisions of ACC football with the exception of Notre Dame replacing Syracuse, the only ACC school which does not field a baseball team, within the Atlantic Division, giving both divisions seven teams. Louisville replaced Maryland in the Atlantic Division beginning with the 2015 season.

Eight ACC teams were selected to play in the 2024 NCAA Division I baseball tournament, with North Carolina, Florida State, NC State and Virginia advancing to the Men&#x27;s College World Series. The ACC has won the Men&#x27;s College World Series twice: by Virginia in 2015 and Wake Forest in 1955. In addition, Miami won four titles before joining the ACC, and South Carolina has won two titles since leaving the league. Current member schools have appeared in the Men&#x27;s College World Series a combined total of 97 times (including appearances before joining the conference). In 2008 and 2016, the ACC was ranked as the top baseball conference by Rating Percentage Index (RPI); the conference has ranked among the top three by this measure each of the past 14 years.
^ Syracuse does not currently field a baseball team but has one appearance in the NCAA baseball tournament prior to joining the conference.
† The count of Men&#x27;s College World Series appearances includes those made by the school prior to joining the ACC:
* Boston College: 4 appearances
* California: 6 appearances
* Florida State: 11 appearances
* Louisville: 3 appearances
* Miami: 21 appearances
* Notre Dame: 2 appearances
* Stanford: 19 appearances
* Syracuse: 1 appearance

==Field hockey==
The ACC has won 22 of the 42 NCAA Championships in field hockey. Maryland won 8 as a member of the ACC.
==Golf==
Of the current ACC members, 14 sponsor both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf, Georgia Tech sponsors only men&#x27;s golf, Miami sponsors only women&#x27;s golf, and Pitt and Syracuse do not sponsor the sport at all. Four team national championships in men&#x27;s golf and seven national titles in women&#x27;s golf have been won by ACC members while in the conference, led by the Duke women&#x27;s team that has won seven national titles since 1999. In addition, 14 more team national titles, 11 in men&#x27;s golf and 3 in women&#x27;s golf, have been won by current ACC members before they joined the conference, led by Stanford (8 men&#x27;s, 2 women&#x27;s).
* &quot;Italics denote championships won before the school joined the ACC.&quot;

==Lacrosse==
Since 1971, when the first men&#x27;s national champion was determined by the NCAA, the ACC has won 19 NCAA championships, more than any other conference in college lacrosse. Virginia has won seven NCAA Championships, North Carolina has won five, Duke has won three, and Notre Dame has won the past two. Former ACC member Maryland won two NCAA Championships as an ACC member. In addition, prior to the establishment of the NCAA tournament, Maryland had won nine national championships while Virginia won two. Syracuse, which joined the ACC in 2013, won ten NCAA-sponsored national championships, the most ever by any Division I lacrosse program, before joining the conference. Since 1987, the only years in which the national championship game did not feature a current ACC member were 2015, 2017, and 2022.

Women&#x27;s lacrosse has awarded a national championship since 1982, and the ACC has won more titles than any other conference. In all, the ACC has won 13 women&#x27;s national championships since the conference began sponsoring the sport in 1997: former ACC member Maryland won seven, North Carolina has won three, Boston College has won two, and Virginia has one one. Additionally, Maryland won four (plus one AIAW title in 1981) and Virginia two before 1997.

&quot;Italics denotes championships before it was part of the ACC.&quot;
* Syracuse vacated its 1990 championship due to NCAA violations.

==Soccer==
Before the 2024 arrival of California, SMU, and Stanford, all of which sponsor men&#x27;s soccer, that sport was one of the two ACC sports split into divisions. The divisional split was eliminated for 2024 and beyond. The final divisional setup was:
Fifteen of the 18 ACC schools sponsor men&#x27;s soccer — a higher proportion than any of the other Power Four conferences. Only Georgia Tech, Florida State, and Miami do not sponsor soccer. Virginia has won 7 NCAA titles, and more since 1990 than any other university in the country. The ACC overall has won 19 national championships, including 16 of the 31 seasons between 1984 and 2014. Seven of the championships were won by Virginia, with the remaining nine by: Maryland (three times while they were in the ACC), Clemson (four times), North Carolina (twice), Duke, Wake Forest, Notre Dame, and Syracuse. Stanford, which joined in 2024, won three national titles before joining the ACC.

In women&#x27;s soccer, North Carolina has won 21 of the 39 NCAA titles since the NCAA crowned its first champion, as well as the only Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) soccer championship in 1981. The Tar Heels have also won 22 of the 33 ACC tournaments. They lost in the final to North Carolina State in 1988 and Virginia in 2004, both times by penalty kicks. The 2010 tournament was the first in which they failed to make the championship game, falling to eventual champion Wake Forest in the semi-finals. The 2012 ACC tournament saw North Carolina&#x27;s first quarterfinal loss, to the eventual champion Virginia; however, the Tar Heels went on to win the national title that season. In 2014, Florida State became the first school other than North Carolina to win the national championship as an ACC member. Notre Dame won three NCAA titles before it joined the ACC in 2013. The 2020 NCAA tournament, in which Florida State was national runner-up, was delayed until the spring of 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but is listed as 2020 to distinguish it from the 2021 season, which was played on the sport&#x27;s traditional fall schedule. Stanford has won three women&#x27;s national titles.

==NCAA team championships==
The North Carolina Tar Heels have the most overall NCAA titles, 47, with 34 of those by women&#x27;s teams; the Virginia Cavaliers lead the ACC in men&#x27;s NCAA championships with 23. Excluded from these totals and list are any national titles earned outside the scope of NCAA competition, including Division I FBS football titles, women&#x27;s AIAW championships, equestrian titles, and retroactive Helms Athletic Foundation titles. &quot;Unofficial&quot; NCAA boxing championships are also excluded, though they were earned inside the scope of NCAA competition.

==Capital One Cup standings==
The Capital One Cup is an award given annually to the best men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s Division I college athletics programs in the United States. Points are earned throughout the year based on final standings of NCAA Championships and final coaches&#x27; poll rankings.

Notre Dame (2014, 2022, 2024) has finished first three times, and Virginia (2015 and 2019) has finished first twice for men&#x27;s sports. North Carolina (2013) has once finished first on the women&#x27;s side.

The following table displays ACC top 25 finishes in the Capital One Cup, counting teams that participated in the ACC during that ranking year. T = tie.

<doc id="78024" wikidata="Q783062" url="?curid=78024" title="Big East Conference (1979–2013)">
<text>The Big East Conference was a collegiate athletics conference that consisted of as many as 16 universities in the eastern half of the United States from 1979 to 2013. The conference&#x27;s members participated in 24 NCAA sports. The conference had a history of success at the national level in basketball throughout its history, while its shorter (1991 to 2013) football program, created by inviting one college and four other &quot;associate members&quot; (their football programs only) into the conference, resulted in two national championships.

In basketball, Big East teams made 18 Final Four appearances and won 7 NCAA championships as Big East members through 2013 (UConn with three, Georgetown, Syracuse, Louisville and Villanova with one each). Of the Big East&#x27;s full members, all but South Florida attended the Final Four, the most of any conference, though Marquette, DePaul, Notre Dame, Rutgers, Cincinnati, and Pittsburgh made all their trips before joining the Big East. In 2011, the Big East set the record for the most teams sent to the NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Basketball Championship by a single conference with eleven out of their sixteen teams qualifying.

In football, the Big East entered competition as a conference in 1991, after inviting five football colleges to become members of the Big East, joining three teams from the Big East whose football teams were competing as Division I independents (Boston College, Pittsburgh and Syracuse) to form a new Division I football league. The strength of this league earned the Big East an automatic berth in the Bowl Championship Series, when that series was created in 1998. The Big East won two national football championships, both by University of Miami. Between 2005 and 2012, four of the more successful football schools left the Big East for other conferences, starting a process that led to a complete realignment of the Big East in 2013.

On July 1, 2013, the non-football playing schools (also known collectively as the &quot;Catholic 7&quot;) formed a non-football playing conference that purchased the Big East Conference name. The remaining six football-playing members, three of whom had only joined the Big East in 2005 when the earlier exodus had started, joined with four schools from other conferences to become the American Athletic Conference (The American/AAC), which is the Big East&#x27;s legal successor. The American retains the Big East&#x27;s football structure and inherited its single automatic berth in the Bowl Championship Series. However, both conferences claim 1979 as their founding date, and the same history up to 2013. As of the 2023–24 season, South Florida is the only full member of the original Big East that still plays in the AAC today.

==History==
===Founding: the early years===
The Big East, often referred to as the Classic Big East, was founded in 1979 after new NCAA basketball scheduling requirements caused the athletic directors of independent schools Providence, St. John&#x27;s, Georgetown, and Syracuse to discuss the creation of a conference centered in the Northeast. Other schools invited were Seton Hall, Connecticut, Holy Cross, Rutgers, and Boston College, with Rutgers and Holy Cross declining to join. Villanova joined a year later in 1980 and Pittsburgh joined in 1982. Before the formation of the conference, many of these schools participated in the ECAC men&#x27;s basketball tournament in order to receive an automatic bid for the NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Basketball Championship.

In 1982, Penn State applied for membership, but was rejected, with only five schools in favor (Penn State needed six out of eight). It was long rumored that Syracuse cast the deciding vote against Penn State, but Mike Tranghese confirmed that this was not the case and that Syracuse had, in fact, voted for Penn State&#x27;s inclusion. Penn State would loom large over the conference during future rounds of realignment as the Nittany Lions had the potential to shore up the conference once football members began to join. Following the decisions by Georgetown, St. John&#x27;s, and fellow Pennsylvania school Villanova to vote against Penn State&#x27;s admission, then-Big Ten administrator and future-Big East commissioner Mike Tranghese said the conference would &quot;rue the day&quot; they rejected the Nittany Lions.

===Football expansion===
About a decade after the conference&#x27;s inception, Big East members decided to become a major football conference and thus added five schools including Rutgers, Miami, Temple, Virginia Tech, and West Virginia – though only Miami would be offered full all-sports membership immediately. The inaugural Big East football season launched in 1991. West Virginia and Rutgers were offered admission to the Big East as full members starting in the 1995–96 academic year, and Notre Dame, committed to its football independence, was offered a non-football membership effective the same year. Virginia Tech would be forced to wait until 2000–01 for full admission, and Temple remained a football-only member until 2004, when it was voted out of the conference due to poor attendance figures, lack of playing success, and inadequate facilities.

===Turmoil and realignment===
Some have argued that the unusual structure of the Big East, with the &quot;football&quot; and &quot;non-football&quot; schools, led to instability in the conference. In 2003, the ongoing press reports of tensions between the football schools and the basketball-only schools finally exploded into a months-long public tug-of-war between the Big East and the Atlantic Coast Conference over several Big East members. The result was that three Big East schools—Virginia Tech, Miami and Boston College—moved to the ACC, while five schools moved to the Big East from Conference USA—Louisville, Cincinnati, South Florida, Marquette, and DePaul.

The addition of the three football schools, along with Big East non-football member Connecticut moving up to the Big East football conference, ensured that the league would keep the minimum eight teams needed to keep its BCS bid. In addition, two traditional basketball teams, DePaul and Marquette, were added to gain the Chicago and Milwaukee television markets and help the already solid basketball status of the conference.

Meanwhile, Loyola University Maryland (then Loyola College in Maryland) also joined the Big East as an associate member in women&#x27;s lacrosse for the 2005–06 academic year.

===Continued instability===
In 2010, Texas Christian University accepted an invitation to join the conference as an all-sports member beginning in the 2012–13 academic year. Big East schools compete in Division I. Most of the football-playing schools play in Division I FBS, while Georgetown and Villanova have Division I FCS (formerly I-AA) football programs. Georgetown football competes in the Patriot League. Villanova has competed in the Colonial Athletic Association football conference since 1988, dating back to its time as a completely separate conference known as the Yankee Conference, which merged with the Atlantic 10 Conference in 1997, then in 2007 the CAA took over management of the A-10 football conference (which happened after Northeastern University joined the CAA in 2005, giving them the six football-playing members needed to start sponsoring football, which was eventually dropped by Northeastern after 2009). In September 2010, in the wake of a Division I realignment that affected a number of conferences around the country, the Big East asked Villanova to consider becoming a football member. The school once considered the offer, which required the school to substantially expand its football budget, as well as expand its stadium to meet FBS requirements or find another suitable venue in the Philadelphia area. Villanova presented a plan to the Big East football members on April 10, 2011, which included the use of PPL Park as a football stadium, but the league declined to schedule a vote to offer membership on the objections of Pittsburgh, West Virginia and Rutgers to the plan. On September 17, 2011, Syracuse, a charter member of the conference, and Pittsburgh announced that they would be leaving the Big East for the Atlantic Coast Conference. Both schools originally intended to fulfill their commitment to the 27-month waiting period. TCU also reversed its decision and accepted an invitation from the Big 12 Conference to move there.

On October 28, 2011, it was announced by the Big 12 Conference that West Virginia accepted its invitation to join, with membership beginning in 2012. This timeline was challenged by the Big East, and countersuits were launched by the school and conference. Eventually, a settlement was reached with allowed West Virginia&#x27;s departure for 2012 in exchange for sizable compensation. Syracuse and Pittsburgh then used the acquiescence of the Big East to West Virginia&#x27;s departure to challenge the validity of their own commitment, and the Big East agreed to a settlement with both schools in July 2012 to allow their departure for the 2013 academic year.

In December, after the 2011 football regular season was completed announcements were made that Boise State University and San Diego State University, both of the Mountain West Conference, would join the Big East in football only; and that Conference USA members University of Central Florida, Southern Methodist University, and the University of Houston would join in all sports for the 2013 academic year.

On January 24, 2012, the Navy Midshipmen accepted an invitation to join the Big East for football only starting in 2015.

On February 9, 2012, the Big East invited the University of Memphis to join as a full member in all sports to begin play in 2013.

On March 7, 2012, it was announced that Temple University would return to the conference for football in the 2012 season, filling the void left by West Virginia. Temple would join for all sports in 2013. Temple basketball would move over from the Atlantic 10 Conference, where they have been a perennial powerhouse.

On August 29, 2012, Loyola and the Patriot League announced that all Loyola athletic teams, including the school&#x27;s Big East team in women&#x27;s lacrosse, would join that conference on July 1, 2013.

On September 12, 2012, Notre Dame announced it would follow Pittsburgh and Syracuse to the ACC, joining that league in all sports except football. Notre Dame and the Big East reached agreement on March 13, 2013; the exit took place July 1, 2013.

On November 20, 2012, Rutgers announced it would be leaving the Big East to join the Big Ten Conference as a full member, effective with the start of the 2014–15 academic year. Rutgers&#x27; announcement came one day after the University of Maryland departed the ACC to join the Big Ten. One week later, on November 27, Tulane University accepted the Big East&#x27;s invitation to join as an all-sports member. East Carolina University&#x27;s football program also joined the Big East in 2014; both schools were previously with Conference USA. The following day the ACC voted to invite Louisville to join in 2014, making them the seventh school since 2004 to leave the Big East in favor of the ACC. On March 27, 2013, East Carolina&#x27;s future membership in the renamed conference was officially upgraded to all-sports membership.

===Conference split===

====New Big East====
Less than two weeks after Louisville announced its departure for the ACC, multiple media reports indicated that the Big East&#x27;s seven remaining non-FBS schools, all Catholic institutions, were considering a mass exit from the conference. By December 13, it was likely that the non-FBS schools would indeed leave to form a new conference, and on December 15, the seven schools (soon to be called the &quot;Catholic 7&quot; by the media) made their departure official, effective with the 2015–16 school year. Many details remained to be worked out, with one major issue being whether the &quot;Big East&quot; name would stay with the FBS schools.

On December 31, Boise State announced they had decided to stay in the Mountain West conference, leaving the Big East, much like TCU, without ever playing a game in it. With Boise State staying in the Mountain West, it was noted that San Diego State would indeed try to rejoin the Mountain West as well. On January 16, 2013, reports surfaced that SDSU would indeed stay in the Mountain West. Rumors of the MWC looking at potentially adding Houston and SMU as its 13th and 14th football members, both of which had stated they would join the Big East in 2013, continued to circulate as well.

In February 2013, multiple media reports indicated that the &quot;Catholic 7&quot; would depart in July 2013, two years earlier than originally planned. On March 5, the Associated Press reported tentative details of a financial agreement: In exchange for selling both the Big East name and a contract with Madison Square Garden (MSG) to host the men&#x27;s basketball tournament to the &quot;Catholic 7&quot;, as well as $10 million, the football schools would receive $100 million of a $110 million pool that had accumulated from entry fees, exit fees, and proceeds earned from appearances in the NCAA men&#x27;s basketball tournament. On April 3, the football-playing schools, which retained the old Big East&#x27;s structure and its automatic BCS bid, announced they would operate as the American Athletic Conference starting on July 1.

===Membership timeline===


===Subsequent conference affiliations===
==Commissioners==
Mike Tranghese retired at the end of the 2008–09 academic year, which he announced in June 2008, and was replaced by former senior associate commissioner John Marinatto. On May 7, 2012, John Marinatto resigned as commissioner. He was replaced by Joseph Bailey on an interim basis. Mike Aresco, the Executive Vice President of CBS Sports&#x27; Programming, was named Commissioner of The Big East on August 14, 2012. After the old Big East changed its name to the American Athletic Conference, Aresco continued as commissioner. The new Big East named Val Ackerman as commissioner on July 1, but reckons her as its fifth commissioner.

==Member institutions==
As of the beginning of the 2012–13 academic year, there were 15 full members and two associate members of the Big East. On July 1, 2013, Pittsburgh, Syracuse, and Notre Dame joined the ACC. DePaul, Georgetown, Marquette, Providence, St. John&#x27;s, Seton Hall, and Villanova joined the new Big East. Cincinnati, Connecticut, South Florida, and Temple remained in the old Big East, which changed its name to the American Athletic Conference. Rutgers and Louisville played one season in the AAC before joining the Big Ten and ACC, respectively, for 2014–15.

&quot;Note: Syracuse, Pittsburgh, Notre Dame and Louisville left the Big East and joined the ACC. Syracuse and Pittsburgh departed the Big East on July 1, 2013; each paid the Big East $7.5 million to depart on that date. Notre Dame joined the ACC on July 1, 2013, while Louisville left for the ACC on July 1, 2014. Rutgers left for the Big Ten on July 1, 2014.&quot;

====Former associate members====
&quot;* Rutgers and West Virginia joined the Big East as full members in 1995.&quot;
&quot;** Virginia Tech joined the Big East as a full member in 2000.&quot;
&quot;*** Temple was removed from the Big East as a football-only member after the 2004 football season. Temple was invited to the Big East as a full member in March 2012, with football returning in July 2012 and all other sports joining in July 2013.&quot;

====Invited members====
The following is a list of institutions which planned to join the Big East conference but later reneged. The Big East invited ten schools – five full time members (University of Houston, Texas Christian University, Southern Methodist University, University of Memphis, University of Central Florida) and, five as football-only members (United States Air Force Academy, United States Naval Academy, Boise State University, Brigham Young University, San Diego State University). To further stabilize the conference, members unanimously agreed to double the exit fee from $5 million to $10 million, contingent on any one accepted invitation. Of the schools, all four invited to full membership accepted, as well as football-only Boise State, Navy, and San Diego State. BYU and the Big East were unable to come to terms; the conference insisted that BYU relinquish its TV rights for its home games as a condition of membership, and BYU was unwilling to do so.

&quot;* TCU was to join the Big East as a full member in 2012 before accepting an invitation to the Big 12.&quot;
&quot;** Houston, Memphis, SMU, and UCF accepted invitations to the Big East as full members.&quot;

==Sports==
The Big East Conference sponsored championship competition in eleven men&#x27;s and thirteen women&#x27;s NCAA sanctioned sports. Temple was an Associate member for football, and Loyola, Maryland was an Associate member for women&#x27;s lacrosse.
NOTE: Under NCAA rules reflecting the large number of male scholarship participants in football and attempting to address gender equity concerns (see also Title IX), each football playing member institution is required to provide two more women&#x27;s varsity sports than men&#x27;s.

==Men&#x27;s basketball==


The Big East was founded by seven charter schools in 1979 (Providence, St. John&#x27;s, Georgetown, Syracuse, Seton Hall, Connecticut, and Boston College). Villanova joined the following year, followed by Pittsburgh in 1982.

Georgetown, led by senior Sleepy Floyd and freshman Patrick Ewing, made the NCAA Championship Game in 1982. Just two years later, in 1984, Georgetown won the Big East&#x27;s first NCAA basketball championship with a victory over the University of Houston.

The following year three Big East teams (Villanova, St. John&#x27;s, and Georgetown) all advanced to the Final Four, culminating in Villanova&#x27;s stunning championship game victory over the heavily favored Georgetown Hoyas. The conference&#x27;s 1985 success was nearly duplicated in 1987, when Syracuse and a surprising Providence both made the Final Four, followed by the Orangemen&#x27;s narrow loss to Indiana University in the tournament final. Two years later, the Seton Hall Pirates also advanced to the NCAA Championship Game, but were defeated by the Michigan Wolverines in an overtime heartbreaker.

Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Georgetown, Villanova, St. John&#x27;s, and Syracuse were the primary powers in the conference. UConn became a power in 1990 with a # 1 seed and a trip to the Elite 8 before being defeated by Duke. Georgetown was led by John Thompson Jr., who was named three times as the conference Coach of the Year. They won five regular season conference championships and six Big East tournaments to go with their 1984 national title. Villanova was coached by Rollie Massimino, who led them to the 1985 NCAA Championship in a historic 66–64 win over No. 1 ranked Georgetown where forward Ed Pinckney was named the Most Outstanding Player. In their first 11 seasons in the Big East, Villanova made 9 trips to the NCAA tournament including advancing to the NCAA Elite Eight in 1982, 1983 and 1988 as well as their 1985 Championship season. Massimino coached for 19 seasons at Villanova, compiling a record of 357–241 (.596). In the NCAA tournament, Massimino had an incredible 20–10 record (.667). St. John&#x27;s was led by Lou Carnesecca, who won the National Coach of the Year honor in 1983 and 1985. He led the Redmen (now the Red Storm) to the 1985 Final Four, and made a post-season appearance in each of his 24 years at the helm. Syracuse has been led by alumnus Jim Boeheim since the 1977 season. He was named conference Coach of the Year in 1984 and 1991. During this period, the Orangemen won five regular season conference championships, three Big East tournaments, and were invited to the NCAA tournament every year but two (1981 and 1982), losing the 1987 National Final to Indiana. Syracuse eventually won its first national title in 2003, led by coach Boeheim and freshman Carmelo Anthony.

Beginning with their first Big East championship in 1990, Connecticut has become the preeminent power in the Big East. Over the past two decades, UConn has made many deep runs in NCAA tournament, playing in the Elite 8 nine times and making four appearances in the Final Four. Hall of Fame coach Jim Calhoun&#x27;s program, led by such stars as Ray Allen, Richard &quot;Rip&quot; Hamilton, Caron Butler, Emeka Okafor and Kemba Walker, averaged nearly 26 wins per year during that time span, won numerous Big East regular season and tournament championships, and claimed the National Championship in 1999, 2004 and 2011.

The conference got a then-record eight teams into the NCAA Men&#x27;s tournament in 2006 and again matched their own record in both 2008 and 2010. At the start of the 2008–2009 season, many sports analysts predicted that the conference would surpass the record by sending 10 teams to the 2009 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament. When the brackets were revealed, seven made it, but three of them (Louisville, Pittsburgh and Connecticut) gained No. 1 seeds, and Louisville earned the top seed overall. Connecticut and Villanova (a No. 3 seed) both reached the Final Four. At the finish of the 2010–11 season, the Big East eclipsed its record, sending 11 teams to the 2011 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament.

The conference has a number of former players currently playing in the National Basketball Association with some of the most recent being Ray Allen, Caron Butler, Carmelo Anthony, Ryan Gomes, Austin Croshere, Richard &quot;Rip&quot; Hamilton, Ben Gordon, Emeka Okafor, Troy Murphy, Hakim Warrick, Quincy Douby, Dante Cunningham, Randy Foye, Kyle Lowry, Rudy Gay, Matt Carroll, Jake Voskuhl, Etan Thomas, Samuel Dalembert, Charlie Villanueva, Donté Greene, Ron Artest, Chris Quinn, Jason Hart, Tim Thomas, Aaron Gray, Daniel Ochefu, Sam Young, DeJuan Blair, Wilson Chandler, Jeff Green, Joe Alexander, Marcus Williams, Jonny Flynn, Terrence Williams, Earl Clark, Roy Hibbert, Wesley Johnson, Wesley Matthews, Lazar Hayward, Jimmy Butler, Steve Novak, Jae Crowder, Maalik Wayns, and Darius Johnson-Odom.

==Women&#x27;s basketball==

Big East women&#x27;s basketball was just as competitive as the conference&#x27;s men&#x27;s programs. Connecticut coach Geno Auriemma has led his women&#x27;s team to eight national championships (including four between 2000 and 2004) and four undefeated seasons (1995, 2002, 2009, and 2010). Connecticut set the record for longest winning streak in all of NCAA women&#x27;s basketball history with a 70-game winning streak stretching from 2001 to 2003. This streak was ended in 2003 when Villanova beat Connecticut for the Big East tournament title, in what is considered one of the biggest upsets in women&#x27;s basketball (Villanova would go on to reach the Elite Eight that year). The Huskies broke their own record with consecutive unbeaten championship seasons in 2009 and 2010, and stretched their streak to 90, a Division I record for both sexes, before losing to Stanford during the 2010–11 season.

Due to the strength of the Connecticut program, 2001 national champion and 2011 and 2012 national runner-up Notre Dame, and 2007 national runner-up Rutgers, the Big East has emerged as one of the major powers in women&#x27;s college basketball. In 2009 two Big East schools met in the national championship game (Connecticut and Louisville) and the South Florida women&#x27;s basketball team defeated Kansas to become the WNIT champions. 
In 2011, UConn and Notre Dame both made the Final Four; the Irish defeated the Huskies in their semifinal but lost to Texas A&amp;M in the NCAA Championship Game. The Irish returned to the championship game in 2012, losing there to unbeaten Baylor.

The final season under the original conference structure, 2012–13, saw three Big East teams make the Final Four—UConn, Notre Dame, and Louisville. UConn first defeated Notre Dame in the semifinals and, in a rematch of the 2009 final, defeated Louisville for the national title.

==Football==
Big East began football during the 1991–1992 season with the addition of Miami and was a founding member of the Bowl Championship Series.

In the league&#x27;s early years the University of Miami dominated, winning nine of the first thirteen championships and two national championships in 1991 and 2001. Virginia Tech also did well, winning the conference in 1995, 1996, and in 1999, when they also earned a No. 2 national ranking. West Virginia and Syracuse were the only other teams to win conference titles during the league&#x27;s original alignment.

The conference experienced a major reconstruction when Miami and Virginia Tech left for the Atlantic Coast Conference in 2004, followed by Boston College in 2005. Initially, Syracuse University was in place to make the jump instead of Virginia Tech, but in 2003, the governor of Virginia Mark Warner put pressure on the ACC (via the vote of the University of Virginia) to ensure that Virginia Tech was not left out of the conference expansion. Syracuse, then, was not invited to the ACC and was left to remain in the Big East. 
Temple had joined the Big East for football only in 1991, but found it difficult to compete with the other league teams and drew very poor attendance to its games. The conference was compelled to expel the Owls voluntarily in 2004 (after playing two seasons as an independent, Temple joined the MAC in 2007).

The universities that replaced them were Louisville, South Florida and Cincinnati from Conference USA. The league also invited the University of Connecticut to play football a year earlier than planned. At about this time, the BCS announced that it would adjust the automatic bids granted to its six founding conferences based on results from 2004 to 2007, and that there would be five, six, or seven such bids starting in 2008. The obvious inference was that soon the Big East might lose its bid.

The conference&#x27;s fortunes improved in 2005. The three new teams from Conference USA began play that year, restoring the league to eight teams. West Virginia won the conference title and the Sugar Bowl, and finished 11–1 and finished No. 5 in the AP poll. Newcomer Louisville also ranked in the Top 20.

In 2006, West Virginia, Louisville, and Rutgers all entered November undefeated. However, they did not stay that way, as in a trio of exciting games over the next month, Louisville defeated West Virginia 44–34, Rutgers defeated Louisville 28–25, and West Virginia defeated Rutgers 41–39 in three overtimes. Louisville won the conference title in the end. In bowl action, the Big East went 5–0, including an Orange Bowl victory for Louisville over Wake Forest and a win by West Virginia over Georgia Tech in the Gator Bowl. Louisville would finish the season ranked 6th, West Virginia 10th, and Rutgers 12th in the final AP Poll.

In 2007, USF rose to No. 2 in the BCS rankings. They lost their next three games, however, to drop out of the rankings. They eventually finished the season No. 21 in the final BCS polls. The Connecticut Huskies, getting as high as No. 13, and West Virginia remained in the top 25. Cincinnati also rose as high as No. 15 in the rankings eventually finishing the season with 10 wins and a No. 17 ranking. Connecticut lost subsequent games and dropped substantially in the rankings, ultimately finishing 25th. On the final day of the season, Pittsburgh upset No. 2 WVU 13–9 in the 100th edition of the Backyard Brawl to give the Huskies a share of the conference championship, while WVU was stopped on the doorstep of the BCS National Championship Game. In bowl games, WVU upset the Big 12 Champion Oklahoma in the Fiesta Bowl, despite having lost their highly touted coach, Rich Rodriguez to Michigan less than a month before the game. West Virginia finished the season ranked No. 6 and Cincinnati finished ranked #17.

The 2009 season saw Cincinnati finish the regular season undefeated at 12–0 and climb to No. 3 in the final BCS standings. After completing a fourth quarter comeback to beat Pittsburgh on the final day of the season, the Bearcats narrowly missed a spot in the BCS national championship game, as No. 2 Texas pulled out a last second win in the Big 12 Championship Game. The Bearcats would go on to lose the Sugar Bowl to No. 5 Florida and finish the year 12–1.

On September 18, 2011, both Pittsburgh and Syracuse were accepted as Atlantic Coast Conference members although the exact date of the move is still uncertain. (&quot;ESPN&quot;.) There are also rumors that UConn is also looking to leave the Big East and join Pittsburgh and Syracuse in the ACC. (&quot;ESPN&quot;.) On October 28, 2011, West Virginia announced it was leaving the Big East to join the Big 12 in 2012. TCU, who had accepted an invitation to join the Big East in the 2012 season, withdrew its acceptance and instead accepted an invitation to join the Big 12.
In 2011, as a response to major shifts in the college football conference landscape, the conference added five new members to help offset the losses of Pittsburgh, Syracuse, and West Virginia. On December 7, 2011, the conference officially added the University of Houston, Southern Methodist University, and the University of Central Florida as all-sports members. Additionally, Boise State and San Diego State of the Mountain West Conference were added as football-only members, but Boise State eventually decided not to join the Big East, which allowed San Diego State to withdraw without penalty.

===Champions===

*No official championship awarded in 1991 and 1992, as the conference did not start full league play until 1993.

**Louisville received the BCS bid since they were the highest ranked team in the final BCS poll.

===BCS Bowl Games===
The Big East had an 8–7 record in BCS bowl games, including a 1–2 record in National Championship games.
* Big East team in bold

===Bowl games===
;Notes on bowl game selection
* The Big East&#x27;s BCS representative was not tied directly to a specific BCS Bowl. It was selected to a bowl in the same manner as an at-large team. The BCS may select a second team to play in another BCS bowl game. Beginning in 2008, the Big East champion was rotated between the Orange Bowl, Sugar Bowl, and Fiesta Bowl (in that order).
* Notre Dame was eligible to be chosen in lieu of a Big East team for the Russell Athletic Bowl one time during a four-year period. In a separate rule specific only to Notre Dame that does not affect the Big East&#x27;s BCS representative, Notre Dame is eligible to receive a BCS automatic berth if they finish within the top 8 of the BCS Rankings.

==Lacrosse==

===Men&#x27;s===
In 2010, the Big East created a men&#x27;s lacrosse league with Georgetown, Notre Dame, Providence, Rutgers, St. John&#x27;s, Syracuse, and Villanova participating. Men&#x27;s lacrosse is the 24th sport sponsored by the Big East Conference and is the 11th men&#x27;s sport. The teams play a six-game single round-robin regular-season schedule. There was no Big East men&#x27;s lacrosse championship tournament in 2010 and 2011. Instead, the Big East champion was determined by conference-game winning percentage at the conclusion of the regular season. This winner received the league&#x27;s automatic bid to the 16-team NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Lacrosse Championship. The first Big East championship tournament was played beginning in the 2012 season. Syracuse dominated the sport until its switch to the Atlantic Coast Conference.

Of the Big East men&#x27;s lacrosse schools in the 2013 season, the final season under the original conference structure:
* Georgetown, Providence, St. John&#x27;s, and Villanova became members of the reconfigured Big East. Marquette, which announced plans to add the sport for the 2014 season, is also in the new conference.
* Notre Dame and Syracuse joined the ACC, which already sponsored the sport.
* Rutgers spent the 2014 season in The American before joining the Big Ten. Since Rutgers was the only current or future full member of The American that sponsored men&#x27;s lacrosse, it would remain in Big East lacrosse until the Big Ten began lacrosse competition in the 2015 season.

===Women&#x27;s===
The Big East has sponsored women&#x27;s lacrosse since the 2000–01 season. Georgetown and former member Syracuse have dominated, winning ten championships (including one shared one) as of the 2012–13 season.

==Cross country==
The Big East Conference first crowned men&#x27;s cross country champions in 1979 and women&#x27;s cross country champions in 1982. During the history of the original Big East, six different women&#x27;s teams won Big East Championships: Boston College, Georgetown, Notre Dame, Providence, Villanova and West Virginia. On the men&#x27;s side six teams won Big East Championships as well: Georgetown, Louisville, Notre Dame, Providence, Syracuse and Villanova.

In both the 2009 and 2010 season, the Villanova women captured the NCAA Cross Country Team Championship as they have largely dominated the Big East over the years with numerous Conference Titles. Led by Sheila Reid, a junior from New Market, Ont. who won the 2010 individual champion, the top-ranked Wildcats captured their second straight NCAA Division I women&#x27;s cross country championship. Reid sprinted past Georgetown&#x27;s Emily Infeld and Oregon&#x27;s Jordan Hasay in the final 200 meters to win the individual title. It was the Villanova Women&#x27;s ninth NCAA Team Championship overall in Cross Country. The Wildcats captured six consecutive NCAA Championships from 1989 to 1994 and also won the title again in 1998, 2009 and 2010.

==Conference champions by year==

==Facilities==
Facilities listed here are those used by each school in its final year of Big East membership before the 2013 conference split. Names and capacities are also those from each school&#x27;s final year of pre-split membership, and do not necessarily reflect current data.
Schools that moved to the Big East Conference (2013–present) are highlighted in grey. Those that moved to the Atlantic Coast Conference are in pink. Those that remained in the renamed American Athletic Conference for 2013–14 are in white.

Notes:

1 For certain high-profile home games, Cincinnati uses the Cincinnati Bengals&#x27; Paul Brown Stadium. In 2010, Cincinnati hosted the University of Oklahoma at Paul Brown Stadium. In 2011, Cincinnati used Paul Brown Stadium as an alternate home field for games against Louisville and West Virginia.

2 Late in 2006, Rutgers added approximately 3,000 temporary end zone seats that remained for the 2007 season (total 45,000). In 2008, Rutgers began a stadium expansion project which is expected to increase capacity to over 55,000 seats and add luxury and club seats. The premium seating is projected to be ready for the 2008 season and the additional 12,000 end zone seats are expected for the 2009 season. The stadium is also expected to receive a new name as part of the financing package depends on a name sponsorship.

3 St. John&#x27;s men generally play their Big East home schedule in Madison Square Garden and their non-conference home schedule on campus at Carnesecca Arena. In 2005–06, St. John&#x27;s played only one non-conference game at MSG and one Big East game on campus.

4 For Syracuse basketball games in the Carrier Dome, the court is laid out on one end of the field and stands are erected beside it. This makes the Carrier Dome the largest on-campus venue for college basketball in the nation.

5 For certain high-profile home games, Villanova uses the Wells Fargo Center, and previously used the Spectrum. In 2005–06, Villanova played three home games at the Wells Fargo Center and the rest on campus at The Pavilion. In 2006, the Wells Fargo Center was also a first-round site for the NCAA tournament. Under NCAA rules, a venue is not considered a home court unless a school plays four or more regular-season games there; this enabled Villanova to play its first two tournament games at the Wells Fargo Center (but Villanova was not considered the host school for that sub-region – the Atlantic 10 Conference was). This situation occurred again in 2009, with Villanova playing (and winning) its first two tournament games at Wells Fargo Center.

<text>Whirlwind I was a Cold War-era vacuum-tube computer developed by the MIT Servomechanisms Laboratory for the U.S. Navy. Operational in 1951, it was among the first digital electronic computers that operated in real-time for output, and the first that was not simply an electronic replacement of older mechanical systems.

It was one of the first computers to calculate in bit-parallel (rather than bit-serial), and was the first to use magnetic-core memory.

Its development led directly to the Whirlwind II design used as the basis for the United States Air Force SAGE air defense system, and indirectly to almost all business computers and minicomputers in the 1960s, particularly because of the mantra &quot;short word length, speed, people.&quot;

==Background==
During World War II, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Naval Research Lab approached MIT about the possibility of creating a computer to drive a flight simulator for training bomber crews. They envisioned a fairly simple system in which the computer would continually update a simulated instrument panel based on control inputs from the pilots. Unlike older systems such as the Link Trainer, the system they envisioned would have a considerably more realistic aerodynamics model that could be adapted to any type of plane. This was an important consideration at the time, when many new designs were being introduced into service.

The Servomechanisms Lab in MIT building 32 conducted a short survey that concluded such a system was possible. The Navy&#x27;s Office of Naval Research decided to fund development under &quot;Project Whirlwind&quot; (and its sister projects, Project Typhoon and Project Cyclone, with other institutions), and the lab placed Jay Forrester in charge of the project. They soon built a large analog computer for the task, but found that it was inaccurate and inflexible. Solving these problems in a general way would require a much larger system, perhaps one so large as to be impossible to construct. Judy Clapp was an early senior technical member of this team.

Perry Crawford, another member of the MIT team, saw a demonstration of ENIAC in 1945. He then suggested that a digital computer would be the best solution. Such a machine would allow the accuracy of simulations to be improved with the addition of more code in the computer program, as opposed to adding parts to the machine. As long as the machine was fast enough, there was no theoretical limit to the complexity of the simulation.

Until this point, all computers constructed were dedicated to single tasks, and run in batch mode. A series of inputs were set up in advance and fed into the computer, which would work out the answers and print them. This was not appropriate for the Whirlwind system, which needed to operate continually on an ever-changing series of inputs. Speed became a major issue: whereas with other systems it simply meant waiting longer for the printout, with Whirlwind it meant seriously limiting the amount of complexity the simulation could include.

==Technical description==

===Design and construction===
By 1947, Forrester and collaborator Robert Everett completed the design of a high-speed stored-program computer for this task. Most computers of the era operated in &quot;bit-serial&quot; mode, using single-bit arithmetic and feeding in large words, often 48 or 60 bits in size, one bit at a time. This was simply not fast enough for their purposes, so Whirlwind included sixteen such math units, operating on a complete 16-bit word every cycle in &quot;bit-parallel&quot; mode. Ignoring memory speed, Whirlwind (&quot;20,000 single-address operations per second&quot; in 1951) was essentially sixteen times as fast as other machines. Today, almost all CPUs perform arithmetic in &quot;bit-parallel&quot; mode.

The word size was selected after some deliberation. The machine worked by passing in a single address with almost every instruction, thereby reducing the number of memory accesses. For operations with two operands, adding for instance, the &quot;other&quot; operand was assumed to be the last one loaded. Whirlwind operated much like a reverse Polish notation calculator in this respect; except there was no operand stack, only an accumulator. The designers felt that 2048 words of memory would be the minimum usable amount, requiring 11 bits to represent an address, and that 16 to 32 instructions would be the minimum for another five bits — and so it was 16 bits.

The Whirlwind design incorporated a control store driven by a master clock. Each step of the clock selected one or more signal lines in a diode matrix that enabled gates and other circuits on the machine. A special switch directed signals to different parts of the matrix to implement different instructions. In the early 1950s, Whirlwind I &quot;would crash every 20 minutes on average.&quot;

Whirlwind construction started in 1948, an effort that employed 175 people, including 70 engineers and technicians. The use of carry save multiplication appears to have been first introduced in the Whirlwind computer in the late 1940s. In the third quarter of 1949, the computer was advanced enough to solve an equation and display its solution on an oscilloscope, and even for the first animated and interactive computer graphic game. Finally Whirlwind &quot;successfully accomplished digital computation of interception courses&quot; on April 20, 1951. The project&#x27;s budget was approximately $1 million a year, which was vastly higher than the development costs of most other computers of the era. After three years, the Navy had lost interest. However, during this time the Air Force had become interested in using computers to help the task of ground controlled interception, and the Whirlwind was the only machine suitable to the task. They took up development under &quot;Project Claude&quot;.

Whirlwind weighed and occupied over .

===The memory subsystem===
The original machine design called for 2048 (2K) words of 16 bits each of random-access storage. The only two available memory technologies in 1949 that could hold this much data were mercury delay lines and electrostatic storage.

A mercury delay line consisted of a long tube filled with mercury, a mechanical transducer on one end, and a microphone on the other end, much like a spring reverb unit later used in audio processing. Pulses were sent into the mercury delay line at one end, and took a certain amount of time to reach the other end. They were detected by the microphone, amplified, reshaped into the correct pulse shape, and sent back into the delay line. Thus, the memory was said to recirculate.

Mercury delay lines operated at about the speed of sound, so were very slow in computer terms, even by the standards of the computers of the late 1940s and 1950s. The speed of sound in mercury was also very dependent on temperature. Since a delay line held a defined number of bits, the frequency of the clock had to change with the temperature of the mercury. If there were many delay lines and they did not all have the same temperature at all times, the memory data could easily become corrupted.

The Whirlwind designers quickly discarded the delay line as a possible memory—it was both too slow for the envisioned flight simulator, and too unreliable for a reproducible production system, for which Whirlwind was intended to be a functional prototype.

The alternative form of memory was known as &quot;electrostatic&quot;. This was a cathode ray tube memory, similar in many aspects to an early TV picture tube or oscilloscope tube. An electron gun sent a beam of electrons to the far end of the tube, where they impacted a screen. The beam would be deflected to land at a particular spot on the screen. The beam could then build up a negative charge at that point, or change a charge that was already there. By measuring the beam current it could be determined whether the spot was originally a zero or a one, and a new value could be stored by the beam.

There were several forms of electrostatic memory tubes in existence in 1949. The best known today is the Williams tube, developed in England, but there were a number of others that had been developed independently by various research labs. The Whirlwind engineers considered the Williams tube, but determined that the dynamic nature of the storage and the need for frequent refresh cycles was incompatible with the design goals for Whirlwind I. Instead, they settled on a design that was being developed at the MIT Radiation Laboratory. This was a dual-gun electron tube. One gun produced a sharply-focused beam to read or write individual bits. The other gun was a &quot;flood gun&quot; that sprayed the entire screen with low-energy electrons. As a result of the design, this tube was more of a static RAM that did not require refresh cycles, unlike the dynamic RAM Williams tube.

In the end the choice of this tube was unfortunate. The Williams tube was considerably better developed, and despite the need for refresh could easily hold 1024 bits per tube, and was quite reliable when operated correctly. The MIT tube was still in development, and while the goal was to hold 1024 bits per tube, this goal was never reached, even several years after the plan had called for full-size functional tubes. Also, the specifications had called for an access time of six microseconds, but the actual access time was around 30 microseconds. Since the basic cycle time of the Whirlwind I processor was determined by the memory access time, the entire processor was slower than designed.

===Magnetic-core memory===

Jay Forrester was desperate to find a suitable memory replacement for his computer. Initially the computer only had 32 words of storage, and 27 of these words were read-only registers made of toggle switches. The remaining five registers were flip-flop storage, with each of the five registers being made from more than 30 vacuum tubes. This &quot;test storage&quot;, as it was known, was intended to allow checkout of the processing elements while the main memory was not ready. The main memory was so late that the first experiments of tracking airplanes with live radar data were done using a program manually set into test storage. Forrester came across an advertisement for a new magnetic material being produced by a company. Recognizing that this had the potential to be a data storage medium, Forrester obtained a workbench in the corner of the lab, and got several samples of the material to experiment with. Then for several months he spent as much time in the lab as he did in the office managing the entire project.

At the end of those months, he had invented the basics of magnetic-core memory and demonstrated that it was likely to be feasible. His demonstration consisted of a small core plane of 32 cores, each three-eighths of an inch in diameter. Having demonstrated that the concept was practical, it needed only to be reduced to a workable design. In the fall of 1949, Forrester enlisted graduate student William N. Papian to test dozens of individual cores, to determine those with the best properties. Papian&#x27;s work was bolstered when Forrester asked student Dudley Allen Buck to work on the material and assigned him to the workbench, while Forrester went back to full-time project management. (Buck would go on to invent the cryotron and content-addressable memory at the lab.)

After approximately two years of further research and development, they were able to demonstrate a core plane that was made of 32 by 32, or 1024 cores, holding 1024 bits of data. Thus, they had reached the originally intended storage size of an electrostatic tube, a goal that had not yet been reached by the tubes themselves, only holding 512 bits per tube in the latest design generation. Very quickly, a 1024-word core memory was fabricated, replacing the electrostatic memory. The electrostatic memory design and production was summarily canceled, saving a good deal of money to be reallocated to other research areas. Two additional core memory units were later fabricated, increasing the total memory size available.

=== Vacuum tubes ===
The design used approximately 5,000 vacuum tubes.

The large number of tubes used in Whirlwind resulted in a problematic failure rate since a single tube failure could cause a system failure. The standard pentode at the time was the 6AG7, but testing in 1948 determined that its expected lifetime in service was too short for this application. Consequently, the 7AD7 was chosen instead, but this also had too high a failure rate in service. An investigation into the cause of the failures found that silicon in the tungsten alloy of the heater filament was causing cathode poisoning; deposits of barium orthosilicate forming on the cathode reduce or prevent its function of emitting electrons. The 7AK7 tube with a high-purity tungsten filament was then specially developed for Whirlwind by Sylvania.

Cathode poisoning is at its worst when the tube is being run in cut-off with the heater on. Commercial tubes were intended for radio (and later, television) applications where they are rarely run in this state. Analog applications like these keep the tube in the linear region, whereas digital applications switch the tube between cut-off and full conduction, passing only briefly through the linear region. Further, commercial manufacturers expected their tubes to only be in use for a few hours per day. To ameliorate this issue, the heaters were turned off on valves not expected to switch for long periods. The heater voltage was turned on and off with a slow ramp waveform to avoid thermal shock to the heater filaments.

Even these measures were not enough to achieve the required reliability. Incipient faults were proactively sought by testing the valves during maintenance periods. They were subject to stress tests called &quot;marginal testing&quot; because they applied voltages and signals to the valves right up to their design margins. These tests were designed to bring on early failure of valves that would otherwise have failed while in service. They were carried out automatically by a test program. The maintenance statistics for 1950 show the success of these measures. Of the 1,622 7AD7 tubes in use, 243 failed, of which 168 were found by marginal testing. Of the 1,412 7AK7 tubes in use, 18 failed, of which only 2 failed during marginal checking. As a result, Whirlwind was far more reliable than any commercially available machine.

Many other features of the Whirlwind tube testing regime were not standard tests and required specially built equipment. One condition that required special testing was momentary shorting on a few tubes caused by small objects like lint inside the tube. Occasional spurious short pulses are a minor problem, or even entirely unnoticeable, in analog circuits, but are likely to be disastrous in a digital circuit. These did not show up on standard tests but could be discovered manually by tapping the glass envelope. A thyratron-triggered circuit was built to automate this test.

==Air defense networks==
After connection to the experimental Microwave Early Warning (MEW) radar at Hanscom Field using Jack Harrington&#x27;s equipment and commercial phone lines, aircraft were tracked by Whirlwind I. The Cape Cod System subsequently demonstrated computerized air defence covering southern New England. Signals from three long range (AN/FPS-3) radars, eleven gap-filler radars, and three height-finding radars were transmitted over telephone lines to the Whirlwind I computer in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Whirlwind II design for a larger and faster machine (never completed) was the basis for the SAGE air defense system IBM AN/FSQ-7 Combat Direction Central.

==Legacy==
The Whirlwind used approximately 5,000 vacuum tubes. An effort was also started to convert the Whirlwind design to a transistorized form, led by Ken Olsen and known as the TX-0. TX-0 was very successful and plans were made to make an even larger version known as TX-1. However this project was far too ambitious and had to be scaled back to a smaller version known as TX-2. Even this version proved troublesome, and Olsen left in mid-project to start Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). DEC&#x27;s PDP-1 was essentially a collection of TX-0 and TX-2 concepts in a smaller package.

After supporting SAGE, Whirlwind I was rented ($1/yr) from June 30, 1959, until 1974 by project member, William M. Wolf (1928-2015). The power to run the machine cost $2500 per month, and the Wolf Research and Development Corporation did work for the Air Force and Buckminster Fuller&#x27;s World Game. Ultimately moving Whirlwind I cost $250,000 and the company made $100,000 on it. Wolf R&amp;D Corporation was sold to EG&amp;G in 1967 for $5.5 million.
Ken Olsen and Robert Everett saved the machine, which became the basis for the Boston Computer Museum in 1979. Although much of the machine was lost when decommissioned, many of its components are now in the collection of the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California and the MIT Museum.

As of February 2009, a core memory unit is displayed at the Charles River Museum of Industry &amp; Innovation in Waltham, Massachusetts. One plane of core memory, on loan from the Computer History Museum, is on shown as part of the Historic Computer Science displays at the Gates Computer Science Building, Stanford.

The building which housed Whirlwind was until recently home to MIT&#x27;s campus-wide IT department, Information Services &amp; Technology and in 1997–1998, it was restored to its original exterior design.

<text>In computing, magnetic-core memory is a form of random-access memory. It predominated for roughly 20 years between 1955 and 1975, and is often just called core memory, or, informally, core.

Core memory uses toroids (rings) of a hard magnetic material (usually a semi-hard ferrite). Each core stores one bit of information. Two or more wires pass through each core, forming an X-Y array of cores. When an electrical current above a certain threshold is applied to the wires, the core will become magnetized. The core to be assigned a value – or &quot;written&quot; – is selected by powering one X and one Y wire to half of the required power, such that only the single core at the intersection is written. Depending on the direction of the currents, the core will pick up a clockwise or counterclockwise magnetic field, storing a 1 or 0.

This writing process also causes electricity to be induced into nearby wires. If the new pulse being applied in the X-Y wires is the same as the last applied to that core, the existing field will do nothing, and no induction will result. If the new pulse is in the opposite direction, a pulse will be generated. This is normally picked up in a separate &quot;sense&quot; wire, allowing the system to know whether that core held a 1 or 0. As this readout process requires the core to be written, this process is known as &quot;destructive readout&quot;, and requires additional circuitry to reset the core to its original value if the process flipped it.

When not being read or written, the cores maintain the last value they had, even if the power is turned off. Therefore, they are a type of non-volatile memory. Depending on how it was wired, core memory could be exceptionally reliable. Read-only core rope memory, for example, was used on the mission-critical Apollo Guidance Computer essential to NASA&#x27;s successful Moon landings.

Using smaller cores and wires, the memory density of core slowly increased. By the late 1960s a density of about 32 kilobits per cubic foot (about 0.9 kilobits per litre) was typical. The cost declined over this period from about $1 per bit to about 1 cent per bit. Reaching this density requires extremely careful manufacturing, which was almost always carried out by hand in spite of repeated major efforts to automate the process. Core was almost universal until the introduction of the first semiconductor memory chips in the late 1960s, and especially dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) in the early 1970s. Initially around the same price as core, DRAM was smaller and simpler to use. Core was driven from the market gradually between 1973 and 1978.

Although core memory is obsolete, computer memory is still sometimes called &quot;core&quot; even though it is made of semiconductors, particularly by people who had worked with machines having actual core memory. The files that result from saving the entire contents of memory to disk for inspection, which is nowadays commonly performed automatically when a major error occurs in a computer program, are still called &quot;core dumps&quot;. Algorithms which work on more data than the main memory can fit are likewise called out-of-core algorithms. Algorithms which only work inside the main memory are sometimes called in-core algorithms.

==History==

===Developers===
The basic concept of using the square hysteresis loop of certain magnetic materials as a storage or switching device was known from the earliest days of computer development. Much of this knowledge had developed due to an understanding of transformers, which allowed amplification and switch-like performance when built using certain materials. The stable switching behavior was well known in the electrical engineering field, and its application in computer systems was immediate. For example, J. Presper Eckert and Jeffrey Chuan Chu had done some development work on the concept in 1945 at the Moore School during the ENIAC efforts.

Robotics pioneer George Devol filed a patent for the first static (non-moving) magnetic memory on 3 April 1946. Devol&#x27;s magnetic memory was further refined via 5 additional patents and ultimately used in the first industrial robot. Frederick Viehe applied for various patents on the use of transformers for building digital logic circuits in place of relay logic beginning in 1947. A fully developed core system was patented in 1947, and later purchased by IBM in 1956. This development was little-known, however, and the mainstream development of core is normally associated with three independent teams.

Substantial work in the field was carried out by the Shanghai-born American physicists An Wang and Way-Dong Woo, who created the &quot;pulse transfer controlling device&quot; in 1949. The patent described a type of memory that would today be known as a delay-line or shift-register system. Each bit was stored using a pair of transformers, one that held the value and a second used for control. A signal generator produced a series of pulses which were sent into the control transformers at half the energy needed to flip the polarity. The pulses were timed so the field in the transformers had not faded away before the next pulse arrived. If the storage transformer&#x27;s field matched the field created by the pulse, then the total energy would cause a pulse to be injected into the next transformer pair. Those that did not contain a value simply faded out. Stored values were thus moved bit by bit down the chain with every pulse. Values were read out at the end, and fed back into the start of the chain to keep the values continually cycling through the system. Such systems have the disadvantage of not being random-access, to read any particular value one has to wait for it to cycle through the chain. Wang and Woo were working at Harvard University&#x27;s Computation Laboratory at the time, and the university was not interested in promoting inventions created in their labs. Wang was able to patent the system on his own.

The MIT Project Whirlwind computer required a fast memory system for real-time aircraft tracking. At first, an array of Williams tubes—a storage system based on cathode-ray tubes—was used, but proved temperamental and unreliable. Several researchers in the late 1940s conceived the idea of using magnetic cores for computer memory, but MIT computer engineer Jay Forrester received the principal patent for his invention of the coincident-current core memory that enabled the 3D storage of information. William Papian of Project Whirlwind cited one of these efforts, Harvard&#x27;s &quot;Static Magnetic Delay Line&quot;, in an internal memo. The first core memory of was installed on Whirlwind in the summer of 1953. Papian stated: &quot;Magnetic-Core Storage has two big advantages: (1) greater reliability with a consequent reduction in maintenance time devoted to storage; (2) shorter access time (core access time is 9 microseconds: tube access time is approximately 25 microseconds) thus increasing the speed of computer operation.&quot;

In April 2011, Forrester recalled, &quot;the Wang use of cores did not have any influence on my development of random-access memory. The Wang memory was expensive and complicated. As I recall, which may not be entirely correct, it used two cores per binary bit and was essentially a delay line that moved a bit forward. To the extent that I may have focused on it, the approach was not suitable for our purposes.&quot; He describes the invention and associated events, in 1975. Forrester has since observed, &quot;It took us about seven years to convince the industry that random-access magnetic-core memory was the solution to a missing link in computer technology. Then we spent the following seven years in the patent courts convincing them that they had not all thought of it first.&quot;

A third developer involved in the early development of core was Jan A. Rajchman at RCA. A prolific inventor, Rajchman designed a unique core system using ferrite bands wrapped around thin metal tubes, building his first examples using a converted aspirin press in 1949. Rajchman later developed versions of the Williams tube and led development of the Selectron.

Two key inventions led to the development of magnetic core memory in 1951. The first, An Wang&#x27;s, was the write-after-read cycle, which solved the problem of how to use a storage medium in which the act of reading erased the data read, enabling the construction of a serial, one-dimensional shift register (of 50 bits), using two cores to store a bit. A Wang core shift register is in the Revolution exhibit at the Computer History Museum. The second, Forrester&#x27;s, was the coincident-current system, which enabled a small number of wires to control a large number of cores enabling 3D memory arrays of several million bits. The first use of magnetic core was in the Whirlwind computer, and Project Whirlwind&#x27;s &quot;most famous contribution was the random-access, magnetic core storage feature.&quot; Commercialization followed quickly. Magnetic core was used in peripherals of the ENIAC in 1953, the IBM 702 delivered in July 1955, and later in the 702 itself. The IBM 704 (1954) and the Ferranti Mercury (1957) used magnetic-core memory.

It was during the early 1950s that Seeburg Corporation developed one of the first commercial applications of coincident-current core memory storage in the &quot;Tormat&quot; memory of its new range of jukeboxes, starting with the V200 developed in 1953 and released in 1955. Numerous uses in computing, telephony and industrial process control followed.

===Patent disputes===
Wang&#x27;s patent was not granted until 1955, and by that time magnetic-core memory was already in use. This started a long series of lawsuits, which eventually ended when IBM bought the patent outright from Wang for . Wang used the funds to greatly expand Wang Laboratories, which he had co-founded with Dr. Ge-Yao Chu, a schoolmate from China.

MIT wanted to charge IBM $0.02 per bit royalty on core memory. In 1964, after years of legal wrangling, IBM paid MIT $13 million for rights to Forrester&#x27;s patent—the largest patent settlement to that date.

===Production economics===
In 1953, tested but not-yet-strung cores cost each. As manufacturing volume increased, by 1970 IBM was producing 20 billion cores per year, and the price per core fell to . Core sizes shrank over the same period from around diameter in the 1950s to in 1966. The power required to flip the magnetization of one core is proportional to the volume, so this represents a drop in power consumption by a factor of 125.

The cost of complete core memory systems was dominated by the cost of stringing the wires through the cores. Forrester&#x27;s coincident-current system required one of the wires to be run at 45 degrees to the cores, which proved difficult to wire by machine, so that core arrays had to be assembled under microscopes by workers with fine motor control.

In 1956, a group at IBM filed for a patent on a machine to automatically thread the first few wires through each core. This machine held the full plane of cores in a &quot;nest&quot; and then pushed an array of hollow needles through the cores to guide the wires. Use of this machine reduced the time taken to thread the straight X and Y select lines from 25 hours to 12 minutes on a 128 by 128 core array.

Smaller cores made the use of hollow needles impractical, but there were numerous advances in semi-automatic core threading. Support nests with guide channels were developed. Cores were permanently bonded to a backing sheet &quot;patch&quot; that supported them during manufacture and later use. Threading needles were butt welded to the wires, the needle and wire diameters were the same, and efforts were made to eliminate the use of needles.

The most important change, from the point of view of automation, was the combination of the sense and inhibit wires, eliminating the need for a circuitous diagonal sense wire. With small changes in layout, this also allowed much tighter packing of the cores in each patch.

By the early 1960s, the cost of core fell to the point that it became nearly universal as main memory, replacing both inexpensive low-performance drum memory and costly high-performance systems using vacuum tubes, and later discrete transistors as memory. The cost of core memory declined sharply over the lifetime of the technology: costs began at roughly per bit and dropped to roughly per bit.

Core memory was made obsolete by semiconductor integrated circuit memories in the 1970s, though remained in use for mission-critical and high-reliability applications in the IBM System/4 Pi AP-101 (used in the Space Shuttle until an upgrade in early 1990s, and the B-52 and B-1B bombers).

An example of the scale, economics, and technology of core memory in the 1960s was the 256K 36-bit word (1.2 MiB) core memory unit installed on the PDP-6 at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by 1967. This was considered &quot;unimaginably huge&quot; at the time, and nicknamed the &quot;Moby Memory&quot;. It cost $380,000 ($0.04/bit) and its width, height and depth was with its supporting circuitry (189 kilobits/cubic foot = 6.7 kilobits/litre). Its cycle time was 2.75 μs.

In 1980, the price of a 16 kW (kiloword, equivalent to 32 kB) core memory board that fitted into a DEC Q-bus computer was around . At that time, core array and supporting electronics could fit on a single printed circuit board about in size, the core array was mounted a few mm above the PCB and was protected with a metal or plastic plate.

==Description==

The term &quot;core&quot; comes from conventional transformers whose windings surround a magnetic core. In core memory, the wires pass once through any given core—they are single-turn devices. The properties of materials used for memory cores are dramatically different from those used in power transformers. The magnetic material for a core memory requires a high degree of magnetic remanence, the ability to stay highly magnetized, and a low coercivity so that less energy is required to change the magnetization direction. The core can take two states, encoding one bit. The core memory contents are retained even when the memory system is powered down (non-volatile memory). However, when the core is read, it is reset to a &quot;zero&quot; value. Circuits in the computer memory system then restore the information in an immediate re-write cycle.

===How core memory works===


The most common form of core memory, &quot;X/Y line coincident-current&quot;, used for the main memory of a computer, consists of a large number of small toroidal ferrimagnetic ceramic ferrites (&quot;cores&quot;) held together in a grid structure (organized as a &quot;stack&quot; of layers called &quot;planes&quot;), with wires woven through the holes in the cores&#x27; centers. In early systems there were four wires: &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;Sense&quot;, and &quot;Inhibit&quot;, but later cores combined the latter two wires into one &quot;Sense/Inhibit&quot; line. Each toroid stored one bit (0 or 1). One bit in each plane could be accessed in one cycle, so each machine word in an array of words was spread over a &quot;stack&quot; of planes. Each plane would manipulate one bit of a word in parallel, allowing the full word to be read or written in one cycle.

Core relies on the square hysteresis loop properties of the ferrite material used to make the toroids. An electric current in a wire that passes through a core creates a magnetic field. Only a magnetic field greater than a certain intensity (&quot;select&quot;) can cause the core to change its magnetic polarity. To select a memory location, one of the X and one of the Y lines are driven with half the current (&quot;half-select&quot;) required to cause this change. Only the combined magnetic field generated where the X and Y lines cross (the logical conjunction) is sufficient to change the state; other cores will see only half the needed field (&quot;half-selected&quot;), or none at all. By driving the current through the wires in a particular direction, the resulting induced field forces the selected core&#x27;s magnetic flux to circulate in one direction or the other (clockwise or counterclockwise). One direction is a stored &quot;1&quot;, while the other is a stored &quot;0&quot;.

The toroidal shape of a core is preferred since the magnetic path is closed, there are no magnetic poles and thus very little external flux. This allows the cores to be packed closely together without their magnetic fields interacting. The alternating 45-degree positioning used in early core arrays was necessitated by the diagonal sense wires. With the elimination of these diagonal wires, tighter packing was possible.

===Reading and writing===
The access time plus the time to rewrite is the memory cycle time.

====Reading====
To read a bit of core memory, the circuitry tries to flip the bit to the polarity assigned to the 0 state, by driving the selected X and Y lines that intersect at that core.

* If the bit was already 0, the physical state of the core is unaffected.
* If the bit was previously 1, then the core changes magnetic polarity. This change, after a delay, induces a voltage pulse into the Sense line.

The detection of such a pulse means that the bit had most recently contained a 1. Absence of the pulse means that the bit had contained a 0. The delay in sensing the voltage pulse is called the access time of the core memory.

Following any such read, the bit contains a 0. This illustrates why a core memory access is called a &quot;destructive read&quot;: Any operation that reads the contents of a core erases those contents, and they must immediately be recreated.

====Writing====
To write a bit of core memory, the circuitry assumes there has been a read operation and the bit is in the 0 state.

* To write a 1 bit, the selected X and Y lines are driven, with current in the opposite direction as for the read operation. As with the read, the core at the intersection of the X and Y lines changes magnetic polarity.
* To write a 0 bit, two methods can be applied. The first one is the same as reading process with current in the original direction. The second has reversed logic. To write a 0 bit, in other words, is to inhibit the writing of a 1 bit. The same amount of current is also sent through the Inhibit line. This reduces the net current flowing through the respective core to half the select current, inhibiting change of polarity.

====Combined sense and inhibit====
The Sense wire is used only during the read, and the Inhibit wire is used only during the write. For this reason, later core systems combined the two into a single wire, and used circuitry in the memory controller to switch the function of the wire.

However, when Sense wire crosses too many cores, the half select current can also induce a considerable voltage across the whole line due to the superposition of the voltage at each single core. This potential risk of &quot;misread&quot; limits the minimum number of Sense wires.

Increasing Sense wires also requires more decode circuitry.

====Combined read and write with modify====
Core memory controllers were designed so that every read was followed immediately by a write (because the read forced all bits to 0, and because the write assumed this had happened). Instruction sets were designed to take advantage of this.

For example, a value in memory could be read and modified almost as quickly as it could be read and written. In the PDP-6, the codice_1 (or codice_2) instructions incremented (or decremented) the value between the read phase and the write phase of a single memory cycle (perhaps signaling the memory controller to pause briefly in the middle of the cycle). This might be twice as fast as the process of obtaining the value with a read-write cycle, incrementing (or decrementing) the value in some processor register, and then writing the new value with another read-write cycle.

===Other forms of core memory===
&quot;Word line&quot; core memory was often used to provide register memory. Other names for this type are &quot;linear select&quot; and &quot;2-D&quot;. This form of core memory typically wove three wires through each core on the plane, &quot;word read&quot;, &quot;word write&quot;, and &quot;bit sense/write&quot;. To read or clear words, the full current is applied to one or more &quot;word read&quot; lines; this clears the selected cores and any that flip induce voltage pulses in their &quot;bit sense/write&quot; lines. For read, normally only one &quot;word read&quot; line would be selected; but for clear, multiple &quot;word read&quot; lines could be selected while the &quot;bit sense/write&quot; lines ignored. To write words, the half current is applied to one or more &quot;word write&quot; lines, and half current is applied to each &quot;bit sense/write&quot; line for a bit to be set. In some designs, the &quot;word read&quot; and &quot;word write&quot; lines were combined into a single wire, resulting in a memory array with just two wires per bit. For write, multiple &quot;word write&quot; lines could be selected. This offered a performance advantage over &quot;X/Y line coincident-current&quot; in that multiple words could be cleared or written with the same value in a single cycle. A typical machine&#x27;s register set usually used only one small plane of this form of core memory. Some very large memories were built with this technology, for example the Extended Core Storage (ECS) auxiliary memory in the CDC 6600, which was up to 2 million 60-bit words.

====Core rope memory====

Core rope memory is a read-only memory (ROM) form of core memory. In this case, the cores, which had more linear magnetic materials, were simply used as transformers; no information was actually stored magnetically within the individual cores. Each bit of the word had one core. Reading the contents of a given memory address generated a pulse of current in a wire corresponding to that address. Each address wire was threaded either through a core to signify a binary [1], or around the outside of that core, to signify a binary [0]. As expected, the cores were much larger physically than those of read-write core memory. This type of memory was exceptionally reliable. An example was the Apollo Guidance Computer used for the NASA Moon landings.

===Physical characteristics===

====Speed====
The performance of early core memories can be characterized in today&#x27;s terms as being very roughly comparable to a clock rate of 1 MHz (equivalent to early 1980s home computers, like the Apple II and Commodore 64). Early core memory systems had cycle times of about 6 μs, which had fallen to 1.2 μs by the early 1970s, and by the mid-70s it was down to 600 ns (0.6 μs). Some designs had substantially higher performance: the CDC 6600 had a memory cycle time of 1.0 μs in 1964, using cores that required a half-select current of 200 mA. Everything possible was done in order to decrease access times and increase data rates (bandwidth), including the simultaneous use of multiple grids of core, each storing one bit of a data word. For instance, a machine might use 32 grids of core with a single bit of the 32-bit word in each one, and the controller could access the entire 32-bit word in a single read/write cycle.

====Reliability====
Core memory is non-volatile storage—it can retain its contents indefinitely without power. It is also relatively unaffected by EMP and radiation. These were important advantages for some applications like first-generation industrial programmable controllers, military installations and vehicles like fighter aircraft, as well as spacecraft, and led to core being used for a number of years after availability of semiconductor MOS memory (see also MOSFET). For example, the Space Shuttle IBM AP-101B flight computers used core memory, which preserved the contents of memory even through the &quot;Challenger&quot;″s disintegration and subsequent plunge into the sea in 1986.

====Temperature sensitivity====
Another characteristic of early core was that the coercive force was very temperature-sensitive; the proper half-select current at one temperature is not the proper half-select current at another temperature. So a memory controller would include a temperature sensor (typically a thermistor) to adjust the current levels correctly for temperature changes. An example of this is the core memory used by Digital Equipment Corporation for their PDP-1 computer; this strategy continued through all of the follow-on core memory systems built by DEC for their PDP line of air-cooled computers.

Another method of handling the temperature sensitivity was to enclose the magnetic core &quot;stack&quot; in a temperature controlled oven. Examples of this are the heated-air core memory of the IBM 1620 (which could take up to 30 minutes to reach operating temperature, about and the heated-oil-bath core memory of the IBM 7090, early IBM 7094s, and IBM 7030. Core was heated instead of cooled because the primary requirement was a &quot;consistent&quot; temperature, and it was easier (and cheaper) to maintain a constant temperature well above room temperature than one at or below it.

====Diagnosing====
Diagnosing hardware problems in core memory required time-consuming diagnostic programs to be run. While a quick test checked if every bit could contain a one and a zero, these diagnostics tested the core memory with worst-case patterns and had to run for several hours. As most computers had just a single core-memory board, these diagnostics also moved themselves around in memory, making it possible to test every bit. An advanced test was called a &quot;Shmoo test&quot; in which the half-select currents were modified along with the time at which the sense line was tested (&quot;strobed&quot;). The data plot of this test seemed to resemble a cartoon character called &quot;Shmoo,&quot; and the name stuck. In many occasions, errors could be resolved by gently tapping the printed circuit board with the core array on a table. This slightly changed the positions of the cores along the wires running through them, and could fix the problem. The procedure was seldom needed, as core memory proved to be very reliable compared to other computer components of the day.

<text>A light gun is a pointing device for computers and a control device for arcade and video games, typically shaped to resemble a pistol.

==Early history==

The first light guns were produced in the 1930s, following the development of light-sensing vacuum tubes. In 1936, the technology was introduced in arcade shooting games, beginning with the Seeburg Ray-O-Lite.

These games evolved throughout subsequent decades, culminating in Sega&#x27;s &quot;Periscope&quot;, released in 1966 as the company&#x27;s first successful game, which requires the player to target cardboard ships. &quot;Periscope&quot; is an early electro-mechanical game, and the first arcade game to cost one quarter per play. Sega&#x27;s 1969 game &quot;Missile&quot; features electronic sound and a moving film strip to represent the targets on a projection screen, and its 1972 game &quot;Killer Shark&quot; features a mounted light gun with targets whose movement and reactions are displayed using back image projection onto a screen. Nintendo released the Beam Gun in 1970 and the Laser Clay Shooting System in 1973, followed in 1974 by the arcade game &quot;Wild Gunman&quot;, which uses film projection to display the target on the screen. In 1975, Sega released the early co-operative light gun shooters &quot;Balloon Gun&quot; and &quot;Bullet Mark&quot;.

===Sequential targets===
The first detection method, used by the NES Zapper, involves drawing each target sequentially in white light after the screen blacks out. The computer knows that if the diode detects light as it is drawing a square (or after the screen refreshes), then that is the target at which the gun is pointed. Essentially, the diode tells the computer whether or not the player hit something, and for n objects, the sequence of the drawing of the targets tell the computer which target the player hit after 1 + ceil(log2(n)) refreshes (one refresh to determine if any target at all was hit and ceil(log2(n)) to do a binary search for the object that was hit).

A side effect of this is that in some games, a player can point the gun at a light bulb or other bright light source, pull the trigger, and cause the system to falsely detect a hit on the first target every time. Some games account for this either by detecting if all targets appear to match or by displaying a black screen and verifying that no targets match.

===Infrared emitters===
The Wii Remote uses an infrared video camera in the handheld controller, rather than a simple sensor. Wesley Yin-Poole stated that the Wii Remote was not as accurate as a traditional light gun.

GunCon 3 is an infrared light gun used for the PlayStation 3 port of &quot;Time Crisis 4&quot;.

===Rectangular positioning===
Rectangular positioning is similar to image capture, except it disregards any on-screen details and only determines the rectangular outline of the game screen. By determining the size and distortion of the rectangle outline of the screen, it is possible to calculate where exactly the light gun is pointing. This method was introduced by the Sinden Lightgun.

==Positional gun==

The positional gun is common in video arcades, as a non-optical alternative to a light gun. The positional gun is permanently mounted on a swivel on the cabinet, as an analog joystick for aiming crosshairs onscreen. This is typically more expensive initially but easier to maintain and repair. Positional gun games include &quot;Silent Scope&quot;, the arcade version of &quot;Resident Evil Survivor 2&quot;, &quot;Space Gun&quot;, &quot;Revolution X&quot;, and &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;. Console conversions may use light guns.

A positional gun is essentially an analog joystick that records the position of the gun to determine the player&#x27;s aim on the screen. The gun must be calibrated, which usually happens after powering up. Early examples of a positional gun include Sega&#x27;s &quot;Sea Devil&quot; in 1972, Taito&#x27;s &quot;Attack&quot; in 1976, and &quot;Cross Fire&quot; in 1977, and Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Battle Shark&quot; in 1978.

<text>In botany, apomixis is asexual development of seed or embryo without fertilization. However, other definitions include replacement of the seed by a plantlet or replacement of the flower by bulbils.

Apomictically produced offspring are genetically identical to the parent plant, except in nonrecurrent apomixis. Its etymology is Greek for &quot;away from&quot; + &quot;mixing&quot;. 

Normal asexual reproduction of plants, such as propagation from cuttings or leaves, has never been considered to be apomixis. In contrast to parthenocarpy, which involves seedless fruit formation without fertilization, apomictic fruits have viable seeds containing a proper embryo, with asexual origin. 

In flowering plants, the term &quot;apomixis&quot; is used in a restricted sense to mean agamospermy, i.e. clonal reproduction through seeds. Although agamospermy could theoretically occur in gymnosperms, it appears to be absent in that group.

Apogamy is a related term that has had various meanings over time. In plants with independent gametophytes (notably ferns), the term is still used interchangeably with &quot;apomixis&quot;, and both refer to the formation of sporophytes by parthenogenesis of gametophyte cells.

Male apomixis (paternal apomixis) involves replacement of the genetic material of an egg by the genetic material of the pollen.

Some authors included all forms of asexual reproduction within apomixis, but that generalization of the term has since died out.

==Evolution==
Because apomictic plants are genetically identical from one generation to the next, each lineage has some of the characters of a true species, maintaining distinctions from other apomictic lineages within the same genus, while having much smaller differences than is normal between species of most genera. They are therefore often called microspecies. In some genera, it is possible to identify and name hundreds or even thousands of microspecies, which may be grouped together as species aggregates, typically listed in floras with the convention &quot;&quot;Genus species&quot; agg.&quot; (such as the bramble, &quot;Rubus fruticosus&quot; agg.). In some plant families, genera with apomixis are quite common, for example in Asteraceae, Poaceae, and Rosaceae. Examples of apomixis can be found in the genera &quot;Crataegus&quot; (hawthorns), &quot;Amelanchier&quot; (shadbush), &quot;Sorbus&quot; (rowans and whitebeams), &quot;Rubus&quot; (brambles or blackberries), &quot;Poa&quot; (meadow grasses), &quot;Nardus stricta&quot; (matgrass), &quot;Hieracium&quot; (hawkweeds) and &quot;Taraxacum&quot; (dandelions). Apomixis is reported to occur in about 10% of globally extant ferns. Among polystichoid ferns, apomixis evolved several times independently in three different clades.

Although the evolutionary advantages of sexual reproduction are lost, apomixis can pass along traits fortuitous for evolutionary fitness. As Jens Clausen put it:The apomicts actually have discovered the effectiveness of mass production long before Mr. Henry Ford applied it to the production of the automobile. ... Facultative apomixis ... does not prevent variation; rather, it multiplies certain varietal products.

Facultative apomixis means that apomixis does not always occur, i.e., sexual reproduction can also happen. It appears likely that all apomixis in plants is facultative; in other words, that &quot;obligate apomixis&quot; is an artifact of insufficient observation (missing uncommon sexual reproduction).

==Apogamy and apospory in non-flowering plants==
The gametophytes of bryophytes, and less commonly ferns and lycopods can develop a group of cells that grow to look like a sporophyte of the species but with the ploidy level of the gametophyte, a phenomenon known as apogamy. The sporophytes of plants of these groups may also have the ability to form a plant that looks like a gametophyte but with the ploidy level of the sporophyte, a phenomenon known as apospory.

See also androgenesis and androclinesis described below, a type of male apomixis that occurs in a conifer, &quot;Cupressus dupreziana&quot;.

== In flowering plants (angiosperms) ==

Agamospermy, asexual reproduction through seeds, occurs in flowering plants through many different mechanisms and a simple hierarchical classification of the different types is not possible. Consequently, there are almost as many different usages of terminology for apomixis in angiosperms as there are authors on the subject. For English speakers, Maheshwari 1950 is very influential. German speakers might prefer to consult Rutishauser 1967. Some older text books on the basis of misinformation (that the egg cell in a meiotically unreduced gametophyte can never be fertilized) attempted to reform the terminology to match the term parthenogenesis as it is used in zoology, and this continues to cause much confusion.

Agamospermy occurs mainly in two forms: In &quot;gametophytic apomixis&quot;, the embryo arises from an unfertilized egg cell (i.e. by parthenogenesis) in a gametophyte that was produced from a cell that did not complete meiosis. In &quot;adventitious embryony&quot; (sporophytic apomixis), an embryo is formed directly (not from a gametophyte) from nucellus or integument tissue (see nucellar embryony).

=== Types in flowering plants ===

Maheshwari used the following simple classification of types of apomixis in flowering plants:
*Nonrecurrent apomixis: In this type &quot;the megaspore mother cell undergoes the usual meiotic divisions and a haploid embryo sac megagametophyte is formed. The new embryo may then arise either from the egg (haploid parthenogenesis) or from some other cell of the gametophyte (haploid apogamy).&quot; The haploid plants have half as many chromosomes as the mother plant, and &quot;the process is not repeated from one generation to another&quot; (which is why it is called nonrecurrent). See also parthenogenesis and apogamy below.
*Recurrent apomixis, is now more often called gametophytic apomixis: In this type, the megagametophyte has the same number of chromosomes as the mother plant because meiosis was not completed. It generally arises either from an archesporial cell or from some other part of the nucellus.
*Adventive embryony, also called sporophytic apomixis, sporophytic budding, or nucellar embryony: Here there may be a megagametophyte in the ovule, but the embryos do not arise from the cells of the gametophyte; they arise from cells of nucellus or the integument. Adventive embryony is important in several species of &quot;Citrus&quot;, in &quot;Garcinia&quot;, &quot;Euphorbia dulcis&quot;, &quot;Mangifera indica&quot; etc.
*Vegetative apomixis: In this type &quot;the flowers are replaced by bulbils or other vegetative propagules which frequently germinate while still on the plant&quot;. Vegetative apomixis is important in &quot;Allium&quot;, &quot;Fragaria&quot;, &quot;Agave&quot;, and some grasses, among others.

====Types of gametophytic apomixis====
Gametophytic apomixis in flowering plants develops in several different ways. A megagametophyte develops with an egg cell within it that develops into an embryo through parthenogenesis. The central cell of the megagametophyte may require fertilization to form the endosperm, pseudogamous gametophytic apomixis, or in autonomous gametophytic apomixis endosperm fertilization is not required. 
*In diplospory (also called generative apospory), the megagametophyte arises from a cell of the archesporium.
* In apospory (also called somatic apospory), the megagametophyte arises from some other (somatic) cell of the nucellus.

Considerable confusion has resulted because diplospory is often defined to involve the megaspore mother cell only, but a number of plant families have a multicellular archesporium and the megagametophyte could originate from another archesporium cell.

Diplospory is further subdivided according to how the megagametophyte forms:
* &quot;Allium odorum&quot;–&quot;A. nutans&quot; type. The chromosomes double (endomitosis) and then meiosis proceeds in an unusual way, with the chromosome copies pairing up (rather than the original maternal and paternal copies pairing up).
* &quot;Taraxacum&quot; type: Meiosis I fails to complete, meiosis II creates two cells, one of which degenerates; three mitotic divisions form the megagametophyte.
* &quot;Ixeris&quot; type: Meiosis I fails to complete; three rounds of nuclear division occur without cell-wall formation; wall formation then occurs.
* &quot;Blumea&quot;–&quot;Elymus&quot; types: A mitotic division is followed by degeneration of one cell; three mitotic divisions form the megagametophyte.
* &quot;Antennaria&quot;–&quot;Hieracium&quot; types: three mitotic divisions form the megagametophyte.
* &quot;Eragrostis&quot;–&quot;Panicum&quot; types: Two mitotic division give a 4-nucleate megagametophyte, with cell walls to form either three or four cells.

===Incidence in flowering plants===
Apomixis occurs in at least 33 families of flowering plants, and has evolved multiple times from sexual relatives. Apomictic species or individual plants often have a hybrid origin, and are usually polyploid.

In plants with both apomictic and meiotic embryology, the proportion of the different types can differ at different times of year, and photoperiod can also change the proportion. It appears unlikely that there are any truly completely apomictic plants, as low rates of sexual reproduction have been found in several species that were previously thought to be entirely apomictic.

The genetic control of apomixis can involve a single genetic change that affects all the major developmental components, formation of the megagametophyte, parthenogenesis of the egg cell, and endosperm development. However, the timing of the various developmental processes is critical to successful development of an apomictic seed, and the timing can be affected by multiple genetic factors.

== Related terms ==
* Apomeiosis: &quot;Without meiosis&quot;; usually meaning the production of a meiotically unreduced gametophyte.
* Parthenogenesis: Development of an embryo directly from an egg cell without fertilization is called parthenogenesis. It is of two types:
**Haploid parthenogenesis: Parthenogenesis of a normal haploid egg (a meiotically reduced egg) into an embryo is termed haploid parthenogenesis. If the mother plant was diploid, then the haploid embryo that results is monoploid, and the plant that grows from the embryo is sterile. If they are not sterile, they are sometimes useful to plant breeders (especially in potato breeding, see dihaploidy). This type of apomixis has been recorded in &quot;Solanum nigrum&quot;, &quot;Lilium&quot; spp., &quot;Orchis maculata&quot;, &quot;Nicotiana tabacum&quot;, etc.
**Diploid parthenogenesis: When the megagametophyte develops without completing meiosis, so that the megagametophyte and all cells within it are meiotically unreduced (a.k.a. diploid, but diploid is an ambiguous term), this is called diploid parthenogenesis, and the plant that develops from the embryo will have the same number of chromosomes as the mother plant. Diploid parthenogenesis is a component process of gametophytic apomixis (see above).
* Androgenesis and androclinesis are synonyms. These terms are used for two different processes that both have the effect of producing an embryo that has &quot;male inheritance&quot;.
:The first process is a natural one. It may also be referred to as male apomixis or paternal apomixis. It involves fusion of the male and female gametes and replacement of the female nucleus by the male nucleus. This has been noted as a rare phenomenon in many plants (e.g. &quot;Nicotiana&quot; and &quot;Crepis&quot;), and occurs as the regular reproductive method in the Saharan Cypress, &quot;Cupressus dupreziana&quot;. Recently, the first example of natural androgenesis in a vertebrate, a fish, Squalius alburnoides was discovered. It is also known in invertebrates, particularly clams in the genus &quot;Corbicula&quot;, and these asexually reproducing males are noted to have a wider range than their noninvasive non-hermaphroditic cousins, more similar to hermaphroditic invasive species in the genus, indicating that this does sometimes have evolutionary benefits.
:The second process that is referred to as androgenesis or androclinesis involves (artificial) culture of haploid plants from anther tissue or microspores. Androgenesis has also been artificially induced in fish.
*Apogamy: Although this term was (before 1908) used for other types of apomixis, and then discarded as too confusing, it is still sometimes used when an embryo develops from a cell of the megagametophyte other than the egg cell. In flowering plants, the cells involved in apogamy would be synergids or antipodal cells.
*Addition hybrids, called BIII hybrids by Rutishauser: An embryo is formed after a meiotically unreduced egg cell is fertilized. The ploidy level of the embryo is therefore higher than that of the mother plant. This process occurs in some plants that are otherwise apomictic, and may play a significant role in producing tetraploid plants from triploid apomictic mother plants (if they receive pollen from diploids). Because fertilization is involved, this process does not fit the definition of apomixis.
*Pseudogamy refers to any reproductive process that requires pollination but does not involve male inheritance. It is sometimes used in a restrictive sense to refer to types of apomixis in which the endosperm is fertilized but the embryo is not. A better term for the restrictive sense is centrogamy.
*Agamospecies, the concept introduced by Göte Turesson: &quot;an apomict population the constituents of which, for morphological, cytological or other reasons, are to be considered as having a common origin,&quot; i.e., basically synonymous with &quot;microspecies.

<text>Kevin O&#x27;Neill ( – 3 November 2022) was an English comic book illustrator who was the co-creator of &quot;Nemesis the Warlock&quot;, &quot;Marshal Law&quot; (both with writer Pat Mills), and &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; (with Alan Moore).

==Early life==
O&#x27;Neill was born in London on 22 August 1953, the son of a contractor father and a homemaker mother.

==Career==
===Early career===
O&#x27;Neill began working for the publishing company IPC at the age of 16 as an office boy for &quot;Buster&quot;, which was a children&#x27;s humour title. In 1972 he published two issues of the fanzine &quot;World of Comics&quot;. In 1975 he started publishing, as a personal side project, the fanzine &quot;Just Imagine: The Journal of Film and Television Special Effects&quot; which lasted five regular issues and one special issue through 1978. By 1976 he was working as a colourist on Disney comics reprints and British children&#x27;s comics such as &quot;Monster Fun&quot; and &quot;Whizzer and Chips&quot;. 

Tired of working on children&#x27;s humour titles, he heard that a new science fiction title was being put together at IPC and went to see Pat Mills and asked to be transferred to the new comic which was to be called &quot;2000 AD&quot;.

===&quot;2000 AD&quot;===
O&#x27;Neill initially provided art for pin-ups and covers, including the centre image of Tharg on the cover of the first issue of &quot;2000AD&quot;, bodging and introducing creator credits. After a period of being nurtured by Mills, he eventually started branching out drawing short &quot;Tharg the Mighty&quot; strips, &quot;Future Shocks&quot; and various humorous short stories. However it was not until he started work on &quot;Ro-Busters&quot; (with Pat Mills as writer) in &quot;2000AD&quot; issue 88 that O&#x27;Neill started work on his first major ongoing strip for the title. O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s quirky and unusual work on &quot;Ro-Busters&quot; proved popular and helped establish him as a major &quot;2000AD&quot; creator, as well as establishing what would become a long series of collaborations with writer Pat Mills.

Mills and O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s next major work was a one-off story called &quot;Terror Tube&quot; in issue 167 which was said to be inspired by the song &quot;Going Underground&quot; by The Jam. However the story was a reaction against IPC objecting to a long chase sequence in &quot;Ro-Busters&quot;, so the pair created a six-page story which consisted entirely of an extended chase sequence between the hordes of the villainous Torquemada and a mysterious character called &quot;Nemesis&quot;.

The story proved popular and the pair followed &quot;Terror Tube&quot; up with a two part story featuring Nemesis called &quot;Killer Watt&quot;. This proved to be even more popular and by now O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s grotesque style was winning over more and more fans who also wanted to see more of Nemesis. In issue 222 they would get their wish with the first book of an ongoing &quot;Nemesis the Warlock&quot; series. The strip would eventually rival Judge Dredd in terms of popularity but O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s art would get him into trouble with IPC&#x27;s censors who considered his work too violent and disturbing. However O&#x27;Neill was one of &quot;2000AD&quot;&#x27;s most popular artists and would not only continue working on &quot;Nemesis the Warlock&quot;, but would provide art for &quot;The ABC Warriors&quot; and even &quot;Judge Dredd&quot;.

It was with &quot;Nemesis the Warlock&quot; that O&#x27;Neill would spend most of his time working on for much of the early 1980s, but O&#x27;Neill was suffering from financial difficulties and decided to take offers of work from DC Comics. This meant stopping work upon &quot;Nemesis&quot; and becoming freelance, although he would return for the occasional one-off episode of Nemesis and provide other work for &quot;2000AD&quot;.

The story &quot;Shok!&quot; (created with Steve MacManus for &quot;Judge Dredd Annual 1981&quot;) was involved in controversy when it was realised that it was the basis of Richard Stanley&#x27;s 1990 film &quot;Hardware&quot;. Only after a court case, which Stanley lost, were the two given writing credits on the film. &quot;Hardware&quot; is now considered the first &quot;2000 AD&quot; story to be adapted into film.

===DC Comics and the Comics Code Authority===
O&#x27;Neill had drawn several fill-in issues and short stories for titles such as &quot;The Omega Men&quot;, but his first major work for DC was a story written by Alan Moore for the &quot;Tales of the Green Lantern Corps Annual&quot; No. 2 in 1986. The Comics Code Authority objected to O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s art. When DC asked what was wrong and if anything could be changed (the story featured scenes of a crucifixion) to get approval, the Authority replied that it was O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s entire style they found objectionable. DC pointed out that his art had been passed previously but the Authority stuck by their decision. DC decided to print the comic without the Comics Code Authority stamp. The short story has established continuity points in the DC Universe on which the 2009 storyline &quot;Blackest Night&quot; was based.

1986 also saw the release of the graphic novel &quot;Metalzoic&quot; by the team of Mills and O&#x27;Neill. This was highly acclaimed and one of the first creator owned stories published by DC. The story was reprinted in &quot;2000AD&quot; later the same year.

===&quot;Marshal Law&quot;===
Mills and O&#x27;Neill created a six issue mini-series for Epic Comics called &quot;Marshal Law&quot; which would be their take on superheroes. Although the series sold well, Epic received several complaints about the art, as well as forcing Mills and O&#x27;Neill to change the characters in the &quot;Marshal Law Takes Manhattan&quot; one-shot from the familiar Marvel Comics characters as they intended to use to thinly disguised duplicates of heroes such as Captain America, Spider-Man and The Punisher.

The pair decided to take &quot;Marshal Law&quot; from Epic to the newly formed Apocalypse Comics for a one-off special (featuring a satire on the Batman character) before launching a new weekly comic titled &quot;Toxic!&quot; with Marshal Law as its flagship character. &quot;Toxic!&quot; was an attempt to take on and even rival &quot;2000AD&quot; but although the title initially sold well, it suffered from stories missing issues, including &quot;Marshal Law&quot; which was left incomplete during a story. After 31 issues the title was cancelled and Apocalypse Comics went bankrupt shortly afterward.

After this Mills and O&#x27;Neill took &quot;Marshal Law&quot; to Dark Horse Comics where the story started in &quot;Toxic!&quot; was completed. Dark Horse also published several mini-series featuring Marshal Law, and Epic Comics published a two issue series pitting the character against Clive Barker&#x27;s Pinhead character. The character then appeared on the Cool Beans World website in a series of illustrated novellas, but since the site closed in 2002, Marshal Law has been in limbo since, with the exception of one appearance in &quot;2000AD&quot;. In 2008, Top Shelf Productions announced plans to publish a complete &quot;Marshal Law Omnibus&quot; in 2009.

===&quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;===
In 1999 O&#x27;Neill teamed up with Alan Moore for a six issue series for America&#x27;s Best Comics called &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;. This teamed up various characters in Victorian literature such as Captain Nemo, Allan Quatermain and Dr. Jekyll. The title was a huge success and was followed by a second six issue series which again proved successful but issue five was recalled by Paul Levitz due to a real advert for a Victorian &quot;Marvel Douche&quot; due to him not wishing to offend Marvel Comics.

The film version of &quot;League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; was released in 2003. The film was critically mauled and both Moore and O&#x27;Neill disowned it. After a legal dispute where it was alleged the film was plagiarised by 20th Century Fox and that Fox solicited the idea for Moore and O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s comic as a smokescreen, the pair have taken the third volume of &quot;League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; and its &quot;Nemo&quot; spinoffs to Knockabout Comics and Top Shelf Productions due both to Moore feeling insulted by the lack of support from 20th Century Fox and DC comics in the lawsuit, and also Warner Bros.&#x27; failure to retract false claims of Moore&#x27;s endorsement of the &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; film adaptation.

===Later work===
O&#x27;Neill drew the final &quot;Nemesis the Warlock&quot; story in the special &quot;Prog 2000&quot; millennium edition of &quot;2000AD&quot; in 1999. Apart from this and his work on &quot;League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;, he worked on short strips for &quot;Negative Burn&quot; published by Caliber Comics.

The DVD of the 2003 documentary feature film &quot;The Mindscape of Alan Moore&quot; contains an exclusive bonus interview with Kevin O&#x27;Neill, elaborately detailing the collaboration with Alan Moore&quot;.&quot; O&#x27;Neill talks about &quot;League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Century&quot;, his run-ins with the censors and the status of the &quot;Marshal Law&quot; movie in an interview with &quot;The Times&quot;.

His 2009 work includes &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Century&quot;, the third &quot;League&quot; limited series, the first issue of which was released in May 2009.

O&#x27;Neill was a contributor to Alan Moore&#x27;s bi-monthly magazine, &quot;Dodgem Logic&quot;, which ran from January 2010 to April 2011.

In 2017 he co-wrote the novel &quot;Serial Killer&quot; with Pat Mills.

In a March 2021 podcast O&#x27;Neill revealed that he had completed eight pages of comics for Alan Moore&#x27;s &quot;Moon and Serpent Bumper Book of Magic&quot; for Top Shelf, as well as a cover illustration and design work for the &quot;Cinema Purgatorio&quot; collected edition.

==Death==
O&#x27;Neill died of cancer in London on 3 November 2022. No information was made public about his survivors.

<doc id="78035" wikidata="Q751759" url="?curid=78035" title="Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star">
<text>The Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star is the first jet fighter used operationally by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) during World War II. Designed and built by Lockheed in 1943 and delivered just 143 days from the start of design, two pre-production models saw limited service in Italy just before the end of World War II. Designed with straight wings, the type saw extensive combat in Korea with the United States Air Force (USAF) as the F-80.

America&#x27;s first successful turbojet-powered combat aircraft, it was soon outclassed with the appearance of the swept-wing transonic MiG-15 and was quickly replaced in the air superiority role by the transonic F-86 Sabre. The F-94 Starfire, an all-weather interceptor using the same airframe, also saw Korean War service. The closely related T-33 Shooting Star trainer remained in service with the U.S. Air Force and Navy well into the 1980s, with the last NT-33 variant not retired until April 1997.

==Design and development==

The XP-80 had a conventional all-metal airframe, with a slim low wing and tricycle landing gear. Like most early jets designed during World War II—and before the Allies captured German research data that confirmed the speed advantages of swept-wings—the XP-80 had straight wings, similar to previous propeller-driven fighters. It was the first operational jet fighter to have its engine buried in the fuselage, a format previously used in the pioneering German Heinkel He 178 V1 of 1939, and the later British Gloster E.28/39 demonstrator of 1941. Other early jets generally had two engines because of their limited power, these being mounted in external nacelles for easier maintenance. With the advent of more powerful British jet engines, a single fuselage-mounted engine was more effective, and this configuration was used by nearly all subsequent fighter aircraft.

Lockheed was the first American aircraft company to start work on a jet-powered aircraft, beginning work on the L-133 in 1939. The L-133 eventually developed into an extremely advanced design, including futuristic features such as canard forewings and a blended wing body, but when Lockheed presented the design to the Army Air Force, it was rejected as being technologically unfeasible. Instead the USAAF concentrated development around the much less radical Bell P-59 Airacomet, which first flew in October 1942. It quickly became obvious, however, that the P-59&#x27;s performance was only marginally superior to current piston engined fighters. Bell performed preliminary work revising the P-59 with a low wing and a single fuselage-mounted engine, to be designated XP-59B, but by this time the Bell factory was swamped with other work so the USAAF transferred the project to Lockheed.

The impetus for development of the P-80 was the discovery by Allied intelligence of the Me 262 in spring 1943, which had made only test flights of its own first quartet (the V1 through V4 airframes) of design prototypes at that time, all fitted with retracting tailwheel landing gear. After receiving documents and blueprints comprising years of British jet aircraft research, the commanding General of the Army Air Force, Henry H. Arnold, believed an airframe developed to accept the British-made Halford H-1 B &quot;Goblin&quot; jet engine could provide the superior performance to match the new German jets, and the Materiel Command&#x27;s Wright Field research and development division tasked Lockheed to design the aircraft based on their experience with the L-133. Concept work began on the XP-80 in May 1943. Since the British turbojet was not yet delivered, Lockheed obtained its blueprint dimensions from Bell as ordered by the USAAF. Lockheed&#x27;s team, consisting of 28 engineers, was led by Clarence L. &quot;Kelly&quot; Johnson in the same manner as the P-38 Lightning, in the same remote building with high security and greater autonomy, a continuation of Lockheed&#x27;s Skunk Works style of research and development.
With the Germans and British clearly far ahead in development, Lockheed was pressed to develop a comparable jet as quickly as possible. Kelly Johnson submitted a design proposal in mid-June and promised that the prototype would be ready for testing in 150 days. The Skunk Works team, beginning 26 June 1943, produced the airframe in 143 days, delivering it to Muroc Army Airfield on 16 November.

The project was so secret that only five of the more than 130 people working on it knew that they were developing a jet aircraft, and the British engineer who delivered the Halford H1 engine was detained by the police because Lockheed officials could not vouch for him. After the engine had been mated to the airframe, foreign object damage during the first run-up destroyed the engine. The British engineer who had delivered the engine had warned Lockheed that the skin of the inlet ducts was too thin but the American engineers ignored this warning and both ducts collapsed and were sucked into the engine when at full throttle. This delayed the first flight until a second engine (the only other existing) could be delivered from Britain, de Havilland generously donating the engine intended for the prototype Vampire.

The first prototype (44-83020) was nicknamed &quot;Lulu-Belle&quot; (also known as &quot;the Green Hornet&quot; because of its paint scheme). Powered by the replacement Halford H1 taken from the prototype de Havilland Vampire jet fighter, it first flew on 8 January 1944, with Lockheed test pilot Milo Burcham at the controls. Following this flight, Johnson said, &quot;It was a magnificent demonstration, our plane was a success – such a complete success that it had overcome the temporary advantage the Germans had gained from years of preliminary development on jet planes.&quot; The donated British jet engine and program data had no doubt proved invaluable. In test flights, the XP-80 eventually reached a top speed of at , making it the first turbojet-powered USAAF aircraft to exceed 500 mph in level flight, following the August 1944 record flight of by a special high-speed variant of the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt. Contemporary pilots, when transitioning to pioneering jets like the Shooting Star, were unused to flying at high speed without a loud reciprocating engine and had to learn to rely on the airspeed indicator.

The second prototype, designated XP-80A, was designed for the larger General Electric I-40 engine (an improved J31, later produced by Allison as the J33). Two aircraft (44-83021 and 44-83022) were built. 44-83021 was nicknamed the &quot;Gray Ghost&quot; after its &quot;pearl gray&quot; paint scheme, while 83022, left unpainted for comparison of flight characteristics, became known as the &quot;Silver Ghost&quot;. The XP-80A&#x27;s first test flight was unimpressive, but most of the problems with the design were soon addressed and corrected in the test program. Initial opinions of the XP-80A were not positive, with Lockheed Chief Engineering Test Pilot Milo Burcham commenting that an aircraft he very much enjoyed (powered by the Halford engine) had now become a &quot;dog.&quot; The XP-80As were primarily testbeds for larger, more powerful engines and air intake design, and consequently were larger and 25% heavier than the XP-80.

The P-80 testing program proved very dangerous. Burcham was killed on 20 October 1944 while flying the third YP-80A, 44–83025. The &quot;Gray Ghost&quot; was lost on a test flight on 20 March 1945, although pilot Tony LeVier escaped. Newly promoted to chief engineering test pilot to replace Burcham, LeVier bailed out when one of the engine&#x27;s turbine blades broke, causing structural failure in the aircraft&#x27;s tail. LeVier landed hard and broke his back, but returned to the test program after six months of recovery.

The top-scoring World War II USAAF ace Major Richard Bong was also killed on an acceptance flight of a production P-80 in the United States on 6 August 1945. Both Burcham and Bong crashed as a result of main fuel pump failure. Burcham&#x27;s death was the result of a failure to brief him on a newly installed emergency fuel pump backup system, but the investigation of Bong&#x27;s crash found that he had apparently forgotten to switch on this pump, which could have prevented the accident. He bailed out when the aircraft rolled inverted but was too close to the ground for his parachute to deploy.

After Bong&#x27;s death, both the USAAF and Lockheed wanted to prove the reliability of the airplane. Robert E. Thacker from the Flight Test Division at Wright Field was ordered to select three other pilots, pick up 5 P-80s from Lockheed and fly them to Muroc Army Airbase, and fly each airplane there for 500 hours. Thacker tapped Chuck Yeager, plus two other pilots and they put 500 hours on each airplane without further incident.

After the war, the USAAF compared the P-80 and Me 262 concluding, &quot;Despite a difference in gross weight of nearly , the Me 262 was superior to the P-80 in acceleration, speed and approximately the same in climb performance. The Me 262 apparently has a higher critical Mach number (the Me 262A&#x27;s being at M 0.86), from a drag standpoint, than any current Army Air Force fighter.&quot;

==Operational history==
The Shooting Star began to enter service in late 1944 with 12 pre-production YP-80As, one of which was destroyed in the accident in which Burcham was killed. A 13th YP-80A was modified to the sole F-14 photo reconnaissance model and lost in a December crash.

Four were sent to Europe for operational testing (demonstration, familiarization, and possible interception roles), two to England and two to the 1st Fighter Group at Lesina Airfield, Italy, but when test pilot Major Frederic Borsodi was killed in a crash caused by an engine fire while demonstrating a YP-80A (44-83026) at RAF Burtonwood, Lancashire, England, on 28 January 1945, the YP-80A was temporarily grounded.

Before World War II ended, however, two American pre-production Lockheed YP-80A Shooting Star fighter jets saw limited service in Italy with the USAAF on reconnaissance, in February and March 1945. Because of delays in delivery of production aircraft, the Shooting Star saw no actual combat during the conflict.

The initial production order was for 344 P-80As after USAAF acceptance in February 1945. A total of 83 P-80s had been delivered by the end of July 1945 and 45 assigned to the 412th Fighter Group (later redesignated the 1st Fighter Group) at Muroc Army Air Field. Production continued after the war, although wartime plans for 5,000 were quickly reduced to 2,000 at a little under $100,000 each. A total of 1,714 single-seat F-80A, F-80B, F-80C, and RF-80s were manufactured by the end of production in 1950, of which 927 were F-80Cs (including 129 operational F-80As upgraded to F-80C-11-LO standards). However, the two-seat TF-80C, first flown on 22 March 1948, became the basis for the T-33 trainer, of which 6,557 were produced.

On 27 January 1946, Colonel William H. Councill flew a P-80 nonstop across the U.S. to make the first transcontinental jet flight. He completed the run between Long Beach and New York in 4:13:26 hrs at an average speed of , aided by the upper-level westerly winds, to set a Fédération Aéronautique Internationale record. The P-80B prototype, modified as a racer and designated P-80R,&lt;ref name=&quot;P-80 Shooting Star/44-85200.&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; was piloted by Colonel Albert Boyd to a world air speed record of 623.73 mph (1,004.2 km/h) on 19 June 1947.

The P-80C began production in 1948; on 11 June the newly formed United States Air Force redesignated the type as F-80C. The USAF Strategic Air Command had F-80 Shooting Stars in service from 1946 through 1948 with the 1st and 56th Fighter Groups. The first P-80s to serve in Europe joined the 55th Fighter Group (later redesignated the 31st FG) at Giebelstadt, Germany, in 1946, remaining 18 months. When the Soviet Union blockaded Berlin, a squadron of the 56th FG led by Colonel David C. Schilling made the first west-to-east Atlantic crossing by single-engined jets in July, flying to Germany for 45 days in Operation Fox Able I. Replaced by the newly Shooting Star-equipped 36th Fighter Group at Fürstenfeldbruck, the 56th FG conducted Fox Able II in May 1949. That same year F-80s first equipped the 51st Fighter Group, based in Japan.

The 4th (Langley Air Force Base, Virginia), 81st (Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico), and 57th (Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska) Fighter Groups all acquired F-80s in 1948, as did interceptor squadrons of the Air Defense Command. The first Air National Guard unit to fly the F-80C was the 196th FS of the California ANG in June 1947.

===U.S. Navy service===
Several P-80A Shooting Stars were transferred to the United States Navy beginning 29 June 1945, retaining their P-80 designations. At Naval Air Station Patuxent River, one Navy P-80 was modified with required add-ons, such as an arrestor hook, and loaded aboard the aircraft carrier at Norfolk, Virginia, on 31 October 1946. The following day the aircraft made four deck-run takeoffs and two catapult launches, with five arrested landings, flown by Marine Major Marion Carl. A second series of trials was held on 11 November.

The U.S. Navy had already begun procuring its own jet aircraft, but the slow pace of delivery was causing retention problems among pilots, particularly those of the Marines who were still flying Vought F4U Corsairs. To increase land-based jet-transition training in the late 1940s, 50 F-80Cs were transferred to the U.S. Navy from the U.S. Air Force in 1949 as jet trainers. Designated TO-1 by the Navy (changed to TV-1 in 1950), 25 were based at Naval Air Station North Island, California, with VF-52, and 16 assigned to the Marine Corps, equipping VMF-311 at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro. These aircraft were eventually sent to reserve units. The success of these aircraft led to the procurement by the Navy of 698 T-33 Shooting Stars (as the TO-2/TV-2) to provide a two-seat aircraft for the training role. Lockheed went on to develop a carrier-capable version, the T2V SeaStar, which went into service in 1957.

===Korean War===

Shooting Stars first saw combat service in the Korean War, and were among the first aircraft to be involved in jet-versus-jet combat.

The Americans used the F-80C variant and RF-80 photo-recon variants in Korea. The F-80 flew both air-to-air and air-to-ground sorties, claiming several aerial victories against North Korean Yak-9s and Il-10s.

On 1 November 1950, a Russian MiG-15 pilot, Lieutenant Semyon F. Khominich, became the first pilot in history to be credited with a jet-versus-jet aerial kill after he claimed to have shot down an F-80. According to the Americans, the F-80 was downed by flak. One week later, on 8 November, the first American claim for a jet-versus-jet aerial kill was made when Lieutenant Russell J. Brown, flying an F-80, reported that he downed a MiG-15. Soviet records claim that no MiGs were lost that day and that their pilot, Senior Lieutenant Kharitonov, survived by pulling out of a dive at low altitude.

Despite initial claims of success, the speed of the straight-wing F-80s was inferior to the 668 mph (1075 km/h) MiGs. The MiGs incorporated German research showing that swept wings delayed the onset of compressibility problems, and enabled speeds closer to the speed of sound. F-80s were soon replaced in the air superiority role by the North American F-86 Sabre, which had been delayed to also incorporate swept wings into an improved straight-winged naval FJ-1 Fury. However, F-80 pilots still destroyed a total of six MiG-15s in aerial combat. When sufficient Sabres were in operation, the Shooting Star flew exclusively ground-attack missions, and were also used for advanced flight training duties and air defense in Japan. By the end of hostilities, the only F-80s still flying in Korea were photo-reconnaissance variants.

F-80Cs equipped 10 USAF squadrons in Korea:
* 8th Fighter-Bomber Wing (35th, 36th, and 80th Fighter-Bomber Squadrons), based at Suwon Air Base, was the longest-serving F-80 unit in Korea. It began missions from Japan in June 1950 and continued to fly the Shooting Star until May 1953, when it converted to F-86 Sabres.
* 49th Fighter-Bomber Group (7th, 8th, and 9th FBS) deployed to Taegu AB (K-2), Korea, from Japan in September 1950 and continued fighter-bomber missions in the F-80C until June 1951, when it converted to the F-84 Thunderjet.
* 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing (16th and 25th FIS) operated F-80Cs from Kimpo AB (K-14) and Japan from September 1950 to November 1951 when it transitioned to F-86s.
* 35th Fighter-Interceptor Group and two squadrons, the 39th and 40th FIS, went to Pohang, Korea in July 1950, but converted to the P-51 Mustang before the end of the year.

One RF-80A unit operated in the Korean War:
* &quot;8th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron&quot;, later redesignated 15th TRS, served from 27 June 1950 at Itazuke, Japan, Taegu (K-2), and Kimpo (K-14), South Korea, until after the armistice. The squadron also utilized a few converted RF-80Cs and RF-86s.

During the Korean war, 368 F-80s were lost, including 277 in combat missions and 91 non-combat losses Of the 277 F-80s lost in operations (approximately 30% of the existing inventory), 113 were lost to ground fire, 14 to enemy aircraft, 54 to &quot;unknown causes&quot; and 96 were &quot;other losses&quot;. F-80s are credited by the USAF with destroying 17 aircraft in air-to-air combat and 24 on the ground. Major Charles J. Loring Jr. was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions while flying an F-80 with the 80th Fighter-Bomber Squadron, 8th Fighter-Bomber Wing on 22 November 1952.

<text>Milo Garrett Burcham (May 24, 1903 – October 20, 1944) was an American aviator. He worked as a stunt pilot, airshow pilot, and test pilot.

Burcham was born in Cadiz, Indiana, and grew up in Whittier, California in the eastern Los Angeles basin. Burcham sold burglar alarms of his own design to finance flying lessons from the O&#x27;Donnell School of Aviation in Long Beach, California, where he became chief instructor. In 1933, Burcham and Lt. Tito Falconi of the Italian Air Service competed in setting inverted flight endurance records. Burcham&#x27;s flight of 4 h 5 min 22 s flying in circles over Long Beach, California that December was not broken until July 24, 1991 when U.S. airshow pilot Joann Osterud set a new world&#x27;s record of 4 h 38 min 10 s. In 1936, Burcham flew his Boeing 100 to the World&#x27;s Aerobatic Championship at the National Air Races in Los Angeles.

In 1941, Burcham joined Lockheed as a production test pilot and spent a year as chief pilot of Lockheed&#x27;s operations in England. He became chief engineering test pilot a few years later, and in that capacity was served as copilot on the first flight of the Constellation on January 8, 1943. On January 9, 1944, he turned the first flight of &quot;Lulu-Belle&quot;, the XP-80 prototype, into a thrilling low-level airshow before a crowd of military and civilian VIPs at Muroc Army Air Base (now Edwards AFB).

On October 20, 1944 Burcham was flying the third production prototype YP-80 from Lockheed Air Terminal in Burbank, California. The engine flamed-out on takeoff due to a main fuel pump failure and the airplane crashed one mile west of the terminal, killing him.

He is buried in Forest Lawn Cemetery in Glendale, California.

<text>Jack Ralph Cole (December 14, 1914 – August 13, 1958) was an American cartoonist best known for birthing the comedic superhero Plastic Man, and his cartoons for &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine.

He was posthumously inducted into the comic book industry&#x27;s Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1991 and the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 1999.

==Early life==

Born in New Castle, Pennsylvania, Cole—the third of six children of a dry goods-store owner and amateur-entertainer father and a former elementary school-teacher mother—was untrained in art except for the Landon School of Illustration and Cartooning correspondence course. At age 17, he bicycled solo cross-country to Los Angeles, California and back. Cole recounted this adventure in an early self-illustrated professional sale &quot;A Boy and His Bike&quot; (which has often been cited as appearing in &quot;Boys&#x27; Life&quot; magazine, but in fact the source of this article is unknown, but speculated to have likely appeared in Cole&#x27;s hometown newspaper). Back home, Cole took a job at American Can and continued to draw at night.

==Career==
===Early work===
In 1936, having married childhood sweetheart Dorothy Mahoney soon after graduating high school, Cole moved with his wife to New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village. After spending a year attempting to break in as a magazine/newspaper illustrator, Cole began drawing for the studio of Harry &quot;A&quot; Chesler, one of the first comic-book &quot;packagers&quot; who supplied outsourced stories to publishers entering the new medium. There, Cole drew such features as &quot;TNT Todd of the FBI&quot; and &quot;Little Dynamite&quot; for Centaur Publications comics such as &quot;Funny Pages&quot; and &quot;Keen Detective Funnies&quot;. He produced such additional features as &quot;King Kole&#x27;s Kourt&quot; (under the pseudonym Geo. Nagle), &quot;Officer Clancy&quot;, &quot;Ima Slooth&quot;, &quot;Peewee Throttle&quot;, and &quot;Burp the Twerp: The Super So-An&#x27;-So&quot; (the latter two under the pseudonym Ralph Johns).

===Golden Age of Comic Books===

Lev Gleason Publications hired Cole in 1939 to edit &quot;Silver Streak Comics&quot;, where one of his first tasks was to revamp the newly created superhero Daredevil. Other characters created or worked on by the prolific tyro include MLJ&#x27;s The Comet in &quot;Pep Comics&quot;—who in short order became the first superhero to be killed—and his replacement, the Hangman.

After becoming an editor at Lev Gleason and revamping Jack Binder&#x27;s original Golden Age Daredevil in 1940, Cole was hired at Quality Comics. He worked with Will Eisner, assisting on the writer-artist&#x27;s signature hero The Spirit—a masked crime-fighter created for a weekly syndicated newspaper Sunday supplement and reprinted in Quality Comics. At the behest of Quality publisher Everett &quot;Busy&quot; Arnold, Cole later created his own satiric, Spirit-style hero, Midnight, for &quot;Smash Comics&quot; No. 18 (Jan. 1941). Midnight, the alter ego of radio announcer Dave Clark, wore a similar fedora hat and domino mask, and partnered with a talking monkey—questionably in place of the Spirit&#x27;s young African-American sidekick, Ebony White. During Eisner&#x27;s World War II military service, Cole and Lou Fine were the primary &quot;Spirit&quot; ghost artists; their stories were reprinted in DC Comics&#x27; hardcover collections &quot;The Spirit Archives&quot; Vols. 5 to 9 (2001–2003), spanning July 1942 – Dec. 1944. In addition, Cole continued to draw one and two-page filler pieces, sometimes under the pseudonym Ralph Johns, and a memorable autobiographical appearance in &quot;Inki,&quot; which appeared in &quot;Crack Comics&quot; #34.

===Plastic Man===
Cole created Plastic Man for a backup feature in Quality&#x27;s &quot;Police Comics&quot; #1 (Aug. 1941). While Timely Comics&#x27; quickly forgotten Flexo the Rubber Man had preceded &quot;Plas&quot; as comics&#x27; first stretching hero, Cole&#x27;s character became an immediate hit, and &quot;Police Comics&quot;″ lead feature with issue #5. As well, Cole&#x27;s offbeat humor, combined with Plastic Man&#x27;s ability to take any shape, gave the cartoonist opportunities to experiment with text and graphics in groundbreaking manner—helping to define the medium&#x27;s visual vocabulary, and making the idiosyncratic character one of the few to endure from the Golden Age to modern times. Plastic Man gained his own title in 1943.

By the decade&#x27;s end, however, Cole&#x27;s feature was being created entirely by anonymous ghost writers and artists—including Alex Kotzky and John Spranger—despite Cole&#x27;s name being bannered. One last stint by Cole himself in 1949 and 1950 could not save the title. &quot;Plastic Man&quot; was cancelled in 1956 after several years of reprinting the Cole material, and new stories by others.

Additionally, Cole and writer Joe Millard created the lighthearted feature &quot;The Barker&quot;, starring carnival barker Carnie Callhan. Introduced in &quot;National Comics&quot; #42 (May, 1944), the feature spun off into a 15-issue comic of its own (Autumn 1946 - Dec. 1949)

===&quot;Playboy&quot;===

Cole&#x27;s career by that time had taken on another dimension. In 1954, after having drawn slightly risqué, single-panel &quot;good girl art&quot; cartoons for magazines, using the pen name &quot;Jake&quot;, Cole became a cartoon illustrator for &quot;Playboy&quot;. Under his own name, he produced full-page, watercolored gag cartoons of beautiful but dim girls and rich but equally dim old men. Cole&#x27;s art first appeared in the fifth issue; he would have at least one piece published in &quot;Playboy&quot; each month for the rest of his life. So popular was his work that the second item of merchandise ever licensed by Playboy (after cufflinks with the famous rabbit-head logo) was a cocktail-napkin set, &quot;Females by Cole&quot;, featuring his cartoons. Cole biographer Art Spiegelman said, &quot;Cole&#x27;s goddesses were estrogen soufflés who mesmerized the ineffectual saps who lusted after them.&quot;

===&quot;Millie &amp; Terry&quot;===

Around the same time he started at Playboy, or possibly just before that, Jack Cole created a new comic strip for the faux army Sunday section The American Armed Forced Features, which was produced between 1955 and 1965 by the W.B. Bradbury Co. (which, according to comic and magazine historian Steven Rowe was &quot;an ad agency, selling ads for college magazines in the 40s-50s, before branching out to ad inserts for the military&quot;) as a ready made Sunday comic section that army newspapers could add to their own Saturday or Sunday paper (with room left for their own masthead). Called Millie &amp; Terry, it told the humorous adventures of two friends who move to an army town, where they are constantly pursued by the wolfish soldiers. Stylistically, it fits right in between the style he used for his &quot;Jake&quot; cartoons and the later &quot;Betsy and Me&quot;. Starting with three one page gags, Cole continued the series with half page gags until September 1957. Not much has been written about this unknown series, except for a short piece on Alan Holtz&#x27; The Stripper&#x27;s Guide , a discussion by Jack Cole expert Paul Tumey and a discussion with lot of samples by The Fabulous Fifties 

===&quot;Betsy and Me&quot;===

In 1958, Cole created his own daily newspaper comic strip, &quot;Betsy and Me&quot;, which he sold to the Chicago Sun-Times Syndicate. The strip began on May 26 and chronicled the domestic adventures of nebbishy Chester Tibbet as narrator, his wife Betsy, and their 5-year-old genius son, Farley. For it, Cole utilized &quot;a simplified style,&quot; historian Ron Goulart wrote, &quot;reminiscent of the drawing in the UPA animated cartoons.&quot; &quot;Betsy and Me&quot; ran for months before Cole&#x27;s self-inflicted death; his last daily was published on September 6 and his last Sunday on September 14. In the final Cole daily, Betsy and Chester are seen signing up for a brand-new tract house in Sunken Hills. To continue the strip, the syndicate hired advertising artist Dwight Parks, who had been trying to sell his own strip about a philosophical hobo. 

===Death===
On August 13, 1958, Cole got in his Chevy station wagon, purchased a rifle, and fatally shot himself in the head. On the day he died, Cole mailed a suicide note explaining the reasons for his suicide to his wife Dorothy. The coroner deemed that letter too personal and did not enter it as evidence at the ensuing inquest. The only explanation Dorothy Cole publicly gave was &quot;We had had an argument before.&quot; She subsequently remarried, and disappeared from public view. Cole also wrote a suicide note to his editor and father figure, Hugh Hefner, which was printed in Art Spiegelman&#x27;s biography of Cole, &quot;Jack Cole &amp; Plastic Man: Forms Stretched To Their Limits&quot;. The note reads:
:&quot;Dear Hef, When you read this I shall be dead. I cannot go on living with myself and hurting those dear to me. What I do has nothing to do with you.&quot; 
Gravett notes that while Cole owed Hefner money, his estate would cover this debt. Cole did not participate in the &quot;Playboy&quot; lifestyle, though the evening before his suicide, he did drink a substantial amount at a &quot;Playboy&quot; office party.

The reason why the 43-year-old Cole killed himself remains one of the greatest mysteries in 20th century American cartooning, according to journalist Paul Gravett. Cole was in the prime of a celebrated cartooning career, complete with praise for his sophisticated gag cartoons in &quot;Playboy&quot;, and gaining increasing visibility for his newspaper strip &quot;Betsy and Me.&quot; R. C. Harvey described the suicide as &quot;one of the most baffling events in the history of cartooning&quot;.

==Legacy==
Cole was posthumously inducted into the comic book industry&#x27;s Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1991 and the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 1999.

Cole&#x27;s story &quot;Murder, Morphine and Me&quot;, which he illustrated and possibly wrote for publisher Magazine Village&#x27;s &quot;True Crime Comics&quot; No. 2 (May 1947), became a centerpiece of psychiatrist Dr. Fredric Wertham&#x27;s crusade against violent comic books. Wertham, author of the influential study &quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot;, cited a particular panel of the story&#x27;s dope-dealing narrator about to be stabbed in the eye with a hypodermic needle as an example of the &quot;injury-to-the-eye&quot; motif.

In 2003, writer-artist Art Spiegelman and artist Chip Kidd collaborated on a Cole biography, &quot;Jack Cole and Plastic Man: Forms Stretched to Their Limits,&quot; a portion of which had been published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine in 1999.

<text>Year 437 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Macerinus and Fidenas (or, less frequently, year 317 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;).

<text>A sausage is a type of meat product usually made from ground meat—often pork, beef, or poultry—along with salt, spices and other flavourings. Other ingredients, such as grains or breadcrumbs, may be included as fillers or extenders.

When used as an uncountable noun, the word &quot;sausage&quot; can refer to the loose sausage meat, which can be formed into patties or stuffed into a skin. When referred to as &quot;a sausage&quot;, the product is usually cylindrical and encased in a skin.

Typically, a sausage is formed in a casing traditionally made from intestine, but sometimes from synthetic materials. Sausages that are sold raw are cooked in many ways, including pan-frying, broiling and barbecuing. Some sausages are cooked during processing, and the casing may then be removed.

Sausage making is a traditional food preservation technique. Sausages may be preserved by curing, drying (often in association with fermentation or culturing, which can contribute to preservation), smoking, or freezing. Some cured or smoked sausages can be stored without refrigeration. Most fresh sausages must be refrigerated or frozen until they are cooked.

Sausages are made in a wide range of national and regional varieties, which differ by the types of meats that are used, the flavouring or spicing ingredients (e.g., garlic, peppers, wine, etc.), and the manner of preparation. In the 21st century, vegetarian and vegan varieties of sausage in which plant-based ingredients are used instead of meat have become much more widely available and consumed.
==Etymology==
The word &quot;sausage&quot; was first used in English in the mid-15th century, spelled . This word came from Old North French (Modern French ). The French word came from Vulgar Latin (&quot;sausage&quot;), from (&quot;seasoned with salt&quot;).

==History==

Sausage making is a natural outcome of efficient butchery. Traditionally, sausage makers salted various tissues and organs such as scraps, organ meats, blood, and fat to help preserve them. They then stuffed them into tubular casings made from the cleaned intestines of the animal, producing the characteristic cylindrical shape. Hence, sausages, puddings, and salami are among the oldest of prepared foods, whether cooked and eaten immediately or dried to varying degrees.

An Akkadian cuneiform tablet records a dish of intestine casings filled with some sort of forcemeat.

The Greek poet Homer mentioned a kind of blood sausage in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Epicharmus wrote a comedy titled &quot;The Sausage&quot;, and Aristophanes&#x27; play &quot;The Knights&quot; is about a sausage vendor who is elected leader. Evidence suggests that sausages were already popular both among the ancient Greeks and Romans and most likely with the various tribes occupying the larger part of Europe.

The most famous sausage in ancient Italy was from Lucania (modern Basilicata) and was called &quot;lucanica&quot;, a name which lives on in a variety of modern sausages in the Mediterranean. During the reign of the Roman emperor Nero, sausages were associated with the Lupercalia festival. Early in the 10th century during the Byzantine Empire, Leo VI the Wise outlawed the production of blood sausages following cases of food poisoning.

A Chinese type of sausage has been described, &quot;lap cheong&quot; () from the Northern and Southern dynasties (420589), made from goat and lamb meat with salt, and flavoured with green onion, bean sauce, ginger, and pepper. The modern type of &quot;lap cheong&quot; has a comparatively long shelf life, mainly because of a high content of lactobacilli—so high that it is considered sour by many.

==Casings==
Traditionally, sausage casings were made of the cleaned intestines, or stomachs in the case of haggis and other traditional puddings. Today, natural casings are often replaced by collagen, cellulose, or even plastic casings, especially in the case of industrially manufactured sausages. However, in some parts of the southern United States, companies like Snowden&#x27;s, Monroe Sausage, Conecuh Sausage, and Kelly Foods still use natural casings, primarily from hog or sheep intestines.

==Ingredients==
A sausage consists of meat cut into pieces or ground, mixed with other ingredients, and filled into a casing. Ingredients may include a cheap starch filler such as breadcrumbs or grains, seasoning and flavourings such as spices, and sometimes others such as apple and leek. The meat may be from any animal but is often pork, beef or veal, or poultry. The lean meat-to-fat ratio depends upon the style and producer. The meat content as labelled may exceed 100%, which happens when the weight of meat exceeds the total weight of the sausage after it has been made, sometimes including a drying process which reduces water content.

In some jurisdictions foods described as sausages must meet regulations governing their content. For example, in the United States, the Department of Agriculture specifies that the fat content of different defined types of sausage may not exceed 30%, 35% or 50% by weight; some sausages may contain binders or extenders.

Many traditional styles of sausage from Asia and mainland Europe use no bread-based filler and include only meat (lean meat and fat) and flavorings. In the United Kingdom and other countries with English cuisine traditions, many sausages contain a significant proportion of bread and starch-based fillers, which may comprise 30% of ingredients. The filler in many sausages helps them to keep their shape as they are cooked. As the meat contracts in the heat, the filler expands and absorbs moisture and fat from the meat.

When the food processing industry produces sausages for a low price point, almost any part of the animal can end up in sausages, varying from cheap, fatty specimens stuffed with meat blasted off the carcasses (mechanically recovered meat, MRM) and rusk. On the other hand, the finest quality contain only choice cuts of meat and seasoning. In Britain, &quot;meat&quot; declared on labels could in the past include fat, connective tissue, and MRM. These ingredients may still be used but must be labelled as such, and up to 10% water may be included without being labelled.

==National varieties==
Many nations and regions have their own characteristic sausages, using meats and other ingredients native to the region and employed in traditional dishes.

===Asia===
====Brunei====
 is the traditional Bruneian beef sausage. It is made with minced beef and tallow, marinated with garlic, salt, chillies and spices, and stuffed into cow&#x27;s or buffalo&#x27;s small intestines. It is then fermented through dehydration. Belutak is a common side dish alongside ambuyat.

====China====
A European-style smoked savory &quot;hóng cháng&quot; ( &quot;red sausage&quot;) is produced in Harbin, China&#x27;s northernmost major city. It is similar to Lithuanian and Polish sausages including kiełbasa and &quot;podhalańska&quot; and tends to have a more European flavour than other Chinese sausages. This kind of sausage was first produced in a Russian-capitalized factory named Churin sausage factory in 1909. Harbin-style sausage has become popular in China, especially in northern regions.

Lap cheong (; also lap chong, lap chung, lop chong) are dried pork sausages that look and feel like pepperoni but are much sweeter. In southwestern China, sausages are flavored with salt, red pepper and wild pepper. People often cure sausages by smoking and air drying.

====Taiwan====
Small sausage in large sausage, a segment of Taiwanese pork sausage is wrapped in a sticky rice sausage to make this delicacy, usually served chargrilled.

====Laos====

There are several Lao sausage types, but the most popular are sai ua and sai gork that have a unique taste and are different from most sausages found internationally. Sai oua is an ancient Lao word that literally combines sai (intestine) with ua (stuffed). It originated from Luang Prabang, an ancient royal capital of the former Lan Xang kingdom (1353–1707) located in Northern Laos. Sai ua moo (Lao sausage made with pork meat) was listed among a collection of hand-written recipes from Phia Sing (1898–1967), the king&#x27;s personal chef and master of ceremonies. Both sai ua and sai gork are some of the most popular traditional Lao dishes enjoyed by Lao people not only in Laos but also in countries where Lao people have migrated to.

====Philippines====
In the Philippines, sausages are generally called &quot;longaniza&quot; (Filipino: &quot;longganisa&quot;) in the northern regions and &quot;chorizo&quot; (Visayan: &quot;choriso&quot;, &quot;tsoriso&quot; or &quot;soriso&quot;) in the southern regions. They are usually fresh or smoked sausages, distinguished primarily by either being sweet (&quot;jamonado&quot; or &quot;hamonado&quot;) or garlicky (&quot;de recado&quot; or &quot;derecado&quot;). There are numerous kinds of sausages in the Philippines, usually unique to a specific region like Vigan longganisa, Alaminos longganisa, and Chorizo de Cebu. The most widely known sausages in Philippine cuisine is the Pampanga longganisa. Bulk sausage versions are also known in Philippine English as &quot;skinless sausages&quot;. There are also a few dry sausages like Chorizo de Bilbao and Chorizo de Macao. Most Filipino sausages are made from pork, but they can also be made from chicken, beef, or even tuna.

====Thailand====

There are many varieties of sausages known to Thai cuisine, some of which are specialities of a specific region of Thailand. From northern Thailand comes &quot;sai ua&quot;, a grilled minced pork sausage flavored with curry paste and fresh herbs. Another grilled sausage is called &quot;sai krok Isan&quot;, a fermented sausage with a distinctive slightly sour taste from northeastern Thailand (the region also known as Isan).

====Vietnam====

===Europe===

====Britain and Ireland====

In the UK and Ireland, sausages are a very popular and common feature of the national diet and popular culture. British sausages and Irish sausages are normally made from raw (i.e., uncooked, uncured, unsmoked) pork, beef, venison or other meats mixed with a variety of herbs and spices and cereals, many recipes of which are traditionally associated with particular regions (for example Cumberland sausages and Lincolnshire sausage). They normally contain a certain amount of rusk or bread-rusk, and are traditionally cooked by frying, grilling or baking. They are most typically long, the filling compressed by twisting the casing into concatenated &quot;links&quot; into the sausage skin, traditionally made from the prepared intestine of the slaughtered animal; most commonly a pig.

Due to their habit of often exploding due to shrinkage of the tight skin during cooking, they are often referred to as &quot;bangers&quot;, particularly when served with the most common accompaniment of mashed potatoes to form a bi-national dish known as bangers and mash.

Pigs in blankets is a dish consisting of small sausages (usually chipolatas) wrapped in bacon. They are a popular and traditional accompaniment to roast turkey in a Christmas dinner and are served as a side dish.

In Dublin, sausages are often served in a stew called coddle where they are boiled without first being browned.

There are various laws concerning the meat content of sausages in the UK. The minimum meat content to be labelled pork sausages is 42% (30% for other types of meat sausages), although to be classed as meat, the pork can contain 30% fat and 25% connective tissue. Often the cheapest supermarket pork sausages do not have the necessary meat content to be described as pork sausages and are simply labelled &quot;sausages&quot;; with even less meat content they are described as &quot;bangers&quot; (an unregulated name). These typically contain MRM which was previously included in meat content, but under later EU law cannot be so described.

=====Scotland=====
A popular breakfast food is the square sausage, also known as a Lorne sausage. This is normally eaten as part of a full Scottish breakfast or on a Scottish morning roll. The sausage is produced in a rectangular block and individual portions are sliced off. It is seasoned mainly with pepper. It is rarely seen outside Scotland.

====Poland====
Polish sausages, kiełbasa, come in a wide range of styles such as swojska, krajańska, szynkowa (a ham sausage), biała, śląska, krakowska, podhalańska, kishka and others. Sausages in Poland are generally made of pork, rarely beef. Sausages with low meat content and additions like soy protein, potato flour or water binding additions are regarded as of low quality. Because of climate conditions, sausages were traditionally preserved by smoking, rather than drying, like in Mediterranean countries.

Since the 14th century, Poland excelled in the production of sausages, thanks in part to the royal hunting excursions across virgin forests with game delivered as gifts to friendly noble families and religious hierarchy across the country. The extended list of beneficiaries of such diplomatic generosity included city magistrates, academy professors, voivodes, szlachta. Usually the raw meat was delivered in winter and the processed meat throughout the rest of the year. With regard to varieties, early Italian, French and German influences played a role. Meat commonly preserved in fat and by smoking was mentioned by historian Jan Długosz in his annals:&quot;Annales seu cronici incliti regni Poloniae&quot; The &quot;Annales&quot; covered events from 965 to 1480, with mention of the hunting castle in Niepołomice along with King Władysław sending game to Queen Zofia from Niepołomice Forest, the most popular hunting ground for the Polish royalty beginning in the 13th century.

====Italy====

Sausages in Italian cuisine (Italian: &quot;salsiccia&quot;, , &quot;salsicce&quot;) are often made of pure pork. Sometimes they may contain beef. Fennel seeds and chilli are generally used as the primary spices in the South of Italy, while in the center and North of the country black pepper and garlic are more often used.

An early example of Italian sausage is &quot;lucanica&quot;, discovered by Romans after the conquest of Lucania. Lucanica&#x27;s recipe changed over the centuries and spread throughout Italy and the world with slightly different names. Today, lucanica sausage is identified as &quot;Lucanica di Picerno&quot;, produced in Basilicata (whose territory was part of the ancient Lucania).

&quot;Mazzafegato&quot; sausage (&#x27;liver mash&#x27;, or &#x27;liver sausage&#x27;) is a sausage typically from Abruzzo, Lazio, Marche, Umbria, and Tuscany regions that includes mashed liver. The style from Abruzzo includes pork liver, heart, lungs, and pork cheek, and is seasoned with garlic, orange peel, salt, pepper, and bay leaves. &quot;Salsiccia al finocchio&quot; (&#x27;fennel sausage&#x27;) is a sausage popularised in the Sicily region. These sausages differ from the Tuscan style sausage due the addition of crumbed, dried fennel seeds to the other spices used.

&quot;Salsiccia fresca&quot; (&#x27;fresh sausage&#x27;) is a type of sausage that is usually made somewhat spicy. It is made from fresh meat (often pork) and fat, and is flavoured with spices, salt, and pepper, and traditionally stuffed into natural gut casings. &quot;Salsiccia fresca al peperoncino&quot; (&#x27;fresh chilli sausage&#x27;) is a spicy sausage flavoured with chopped garlic, salt, and chilli pepper (which gives the sausage a redder colour). &quot;Salsiccia secca&quot; (&#x27;dried sausage&#x27;) is an air dried sausages typically made from either the meat of domestic pigs or from the meat from wild boars. &quot;Salsiccia toscana&quot; (&#x27;Tuscan sausage&#x27;), also known as &quot;sarciccia&quot;, is made from various cuts of pork, including the shoulder and ham, which is chopped and mixed with herbs such as sage and rosemary.

====Malta====
Maltese sausage (&quot;Maltese&quot;: &quot;Zalzett tal-Malti&quot;) is made of pork, sea salt, black peppercorns, coriander seeds and parsley. It is short and thick in shape and can be eaten grilled, fried, stewed, steamed or even raw when freshly made. A barbecue variety is similar to the original but with a thinner skin and less salt.

====Ukraine====
In Ukrainian sausage is called &quot;kovbasa&quot; (ковбаса). It is a general term and is used to describe a variety of sausages including &quot;domashnia&quot; (homemade kovbasa), &quot;pechinky&quot; (liver kovbasa), &quot;krovianka&quot; (kovbasa filled with blood and buckwheat) and &quot;vudzhena&quot; (smoked kovbasa). The traditional varieties are similar to Polish kielbasa.

It is served in a variety of ways such as fried with onions atop varenyky, sliced on rye bread, eaten with an egg and mustard sauce, or in &quot;Yayechnia z Kovbosoyu i yarnoyu&quot; a dish of fried kovbasa with red capsicum and scrambled eggs. In Ukraine kovbasa may be roasted in an oven on both sides and stored in ceramic pots with lard. The sausage is often made at home; however it has become increasingly brought at markets and even supermarkets. Kovbasa also tends to accompany &quot;pysanka&quot; (dyed and decorated eggs) as well as the eastern Slavic bread, paska in Ukrainian baskets at Easter time and is blessed by the priest with holy water before being consumed.

====France and Belgium====

French distinguishes between &quot;saucisson (sec)&quot;, cured sausage eaten uncooked, and &quot;saucisse&quot;, fresh sausage that needs cooking. Saucisson is almost always made of pork cured with salt, spices, and occasionally wine or spirits, but it has many variants which may be based on other meats and include nuts, alcohol, and other ingredients. It also differentiates between &quot;saucisson&quot; and &quot;boudin&quot; (&quot;pudding&quot;) which are similar to the British Black, White and Red puddings.

Specific kinds of French sausage include:
* Fresh sausages, mostly grilled, sometimes stewed
** Boudin blanc, a soft, light-colored sausage made of chicken, pork, or veal, or a mixture, and usually also containing eggs and milk;
** Boudin noir, a blood sausage;
** Andouillette, made of pork intestines;
** Cervelas de Lyon, with pistachios or truffles;
** Chipolata, thin and long;
** Crépinette, a small, flattened sausage wrapped in caul fat rather than a casing;
** Merguez, a spicy mutton- or beef-based sausage;
** Saucisse de Toulouse, often used in cassoulet
* Cured or smoked sausages, &quot;saucisson&quot;, served thinly sliced
** Andouille, usually smoked, made primarily of pork intestines
** Rosette de Lyon
** Saucisse de Morteau, smoked
** Saucisson de Lyon

Other French sausages include the diot.

====Germany====

There is an enormous variety of German sausages. Some examples of German sausages include Frankfurters/Wieners, Bratwürste, Rindswürste, Knackwürste, and Bockwürste. Currywurst, a dish of sausages with curry sauce, is a popular fast food in Germany.

====Greece====
Loukániko (Greek: λουκάνικο) is the common Greek word for pork sausage.

The name &#x27;loukaniko&#x27; is derived from ancient Roman cuisine.

====Nordic countries====
Nordic sausages (, , , , ) are usually made of 60–80% very finely ground pork, very sparsely spiced with pepper, nutmeg, allspice or similar sweet spices (ground mustard seed, onion and sugar may also be added). Water, lard, rind, potato starch flour and soy or milk protein are often added for binding and filling. In southern Norway, grilled and wiener sausages are often wrapped in a &quot;lompe&quot;, a potato flatbread somewhat similar to a &quot;lefse&quot;.

Virtually all sausages will be industrially precooked and either fried or warmed in hot water by the consumer or at the hot dog stand. Since hot dog stands are ubiquitous in Denmark (known as &quot;Pølsevogn&quot;) some people regard &quot;pølser&quot; as one of the national dishes, perhaps along with medisterpølse, a fried, finely ground pork and bacon sausage. The most noticeable aspect of Danish boiled sausages (never the fried ones) is that the casing often contains a traditional bright-red dye. They are also called &quot;wienerpølser&quot; and legend has it they originate from Vienna where it was once ordered that day-old sausages be dyed as a means of warning.

The traditional Swedish &quot;falukorv&quot; is a sausage made of a grated mixture of pork and beef or veal with potato flour and mild spices, similarly red-dyed sausage, but about 5 cm thick, usually baked in the oven coated in mustard or cut in slices and fried. The sausage got its name from Falun, the city from where it originates, after being introduced by German immigrants who came to work in the region&#x27;s mines. Unlike most other ordinary sausages it is a typical home dish, not sold at hot dog stands. Other Swedish sausages include &quot;prinskorv&quot;, &quot;fläskkorv&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;isterband&quot;; all of these, in addition to &quot;falukorv&quot;, are often accompanied by potato mash or &quot;rotmos&quot; (a root vegetable mash) rather than bread. &quot;Isterband&quot; is made of pork, barley groats and potato and is lightly smoked.

In Iceland, lamb may be added to sausages, giving them a distinct taste. Horse sausage and mutton sausage are also traditional foods in Iceland, although their popularity is waning. Liver sausage, which has been compared to haggis, and blood sausage are also a common foodstuff in Iceland.

In Finland, there are a few traditional types of sausages that have become a part of Finnish cuisine, such as &quot;ryynimakkara&quot; (groat sausage). There&#x27;s also a blood sausage called &quot;mustamakkara&quot; (black sausage), which has become a traditional dish in the Tampere region. Usually grilled sausages are very popular in Finland during the summer, especially in &quot;juhannus&quot;.

====Portugal and Brazil====

Embutidos (or enchidos) such as chouriço, linguiça, or alheira generally contain hashed meat, most commonly pork, seasoned with aromatic herbs or spices (pepper, red pepper, paprika, garlic, rosemary, thyme, cloves, ginger, nutmeg, etc.).

====Russia====

Traditional Russian cuisine eschews the fine cutting or grounding of meat. Thus sausagemaking, though generally known in Russia since at least 12th century, was not popular and largely started in earnest with the Petrine reforms, when a lot of Western products and practices were introduced. Traditional sausages were based on mixing meat with cereals, much like modern kishka and Polish kaszanka, while the newer purely meat varieties were made in German and Polish styles, often highly spiced and loaded with preservatives for non-refrigerated storage. One of the pre-revolutionary recipes specified as much as half pound of saltpetre per a pood of meat.

After the Revolution, the sausage-making was largely concentrated in large, governmentally controlled meat processing plants, often built from the American examples, which introduced new, medically controlled and industrially made styles such as omnipresent Soviet bolognas — Doktorskaya sausage and its fatter Lyubitelskaya variant, as well as generic wieners and very status-loaded and scarce smoked sausages and salamis. Traditional sausages continued to be made for local consumption by the farmers and such, often sold on Kolkhoz markets, like the home-style sausage, made from roughly minced pork and its fat, spiced with garlic and black pepper — this was a raw sausage, intended for roasting or grilling, but sometimes cooked by hot smoking for preservation and flavour (this variant is often called Ukrainian).

Since the return of capitalism, all imaginable types of sausage are produced and imported in Russia, but the traditional styles, be it a factory made Doctor&#x27;s bologna, artisanal links of delicately smoked Ukrainian or boldly red Krakow, or buckwheat-stuffed blood sausage, still endure.

====Serbia====
Types of sausages in Serbia include Sremska, Požarevačka, and Sudžuk.

====Spain====

In Spain, fresh sausages, &quot;salchichas&quot;, which are eaten cooked, and cured sausages, &quot;embutidos&quot;, which are eaten uncooked, are two distinct categories. Among the cured sausages are found products like chorizo, salchichón, and sobrasada. Blood sausage, morcilla, is found in both cured and fresh varieties. They are made with pork meat and blood, usually adding rice, garlic, paprika and other spices. There are many regional variations, and in general they are either fried or cooked in cocidos.

Fresh sausage may be red or white. Red sausages contain paprika (pimentón in Spanish) and are usually fried; they can also contain other spices such as garlic, pepper or thyme. The most popular type of red sausage is perhaps &quot;txistorra&quot;, a thin and long paprika sausage originating in Navarre. White sausages do not contain paprika and can be fried, boiled in wine, or, more rarely, in water.

The cervelat, a cooked sausage, is often referred to as Switzerland&#x27;s national sausage. A great number of regional sausage specialties exist as well, including air-dried such as salami.

===Latin America===

In most of Latin America, a few basic types of sausages are consumed, with slight regional variations on each recipe. These are &quot;chorizo&quot; (raw, rather than cured and dried like its Spanish namesake), &quot;longaniza&quot; (usually very similar to &quot;chorizo&quot; but longer and thinner), &quot;morcilla&quot; or &quot;relleno&quot; (blood sausage), and &quot;salchichas&quot; (often similar to hot dogs or Vienna sausages). Beef tends to be more predominant than in the pork-heavy Spanish equivalents.

====Argentina and Uruguay====

In Argentina and Uruguay, many sausages are consumed. Eaten as part of the traditional &quot;asado&quot;, &quot;chorizo&quot; (beef and/or pork, flavored with spices) and &quot;morcilla&quot; (blood sausage or black pudding) are the most popular. Both share a Spanish origin. One local variety is the &quot;salchicha argentina&quot; (Argentine sausage), &quot;criolla&quot; or &quot;parrillera&quot; (literally, barbecue-style), made of the same ingredients as the chorizo but thinner. There are hundreds of salami-style sausages. Very popular is the &quot;salame tandilero&quot;, from the city of Tandil. Other types include &quot;longaniza&quot;, &quot;cantimpalo&quot; and &quot;soppressata&quot;.

Vienna sausages are eaten as an appetizer or in hot dogs (called panchos), which are usually served with different sauces and salads. Leberwurst is usually found in every market. Weisswurst is also a common dish in some regions, eaten usually with mashed potatoes or &quot;chucrut&quot; (sauerkraut).

====Chile====

&quot;Longaniza&quot; is the most common type of sausage, or at least the most common name in Chile for sausages that also could be classified as chorizo. The Chilean variety is made of four parts pork to one part bacon (or less) and seasoned with finely ground garlic, salt, pepper, cumin, oregano, paprika and chilli sauce. The cities of Chillán and San Carlos are known among Chileans for having the best &quot;longanizas&quot;.

Another traditional sausage is the &quot;prieta&quot;, the Chilean version of blood sausage, generally known elsewhere in Latin America as &quot;morcilla&quot;. In Chile, it contains onions, spices and sometimes walnut or rice and is usually eaten at &quot;asados&quot; or accompanied by simple boiled potatoes. It sometimes has a very thick skin so is cut open lengthwise before eating. &quot;Vienesa&quot;s or Vienna sausages are also very common and are mainly used in the &quot;completo&quot;, the Chilean version of the hot dog.

====Colombia====

A grilled chorizo served with a buttered &quot;arepa&quot; is one of the most common street foods in Colombia. Butifarras Soledeñas are sausages from Soledad, Atlántico, Colombia. In addition to the standard Latin American sausages, dried pork sausages are served cold as a snack, often to accompany beer drinking. These include &quot;cábanos&quot; (salty, short, thin, and served individually), &quot;butifarras&quot; (of Catalan origin; spicier, shorter, fatter and moister than cábanos, often eaten raw, sliced and sprinkled with lemon juice) and &quot;salchichón&quot; (a long, thin and heavily processed sausage served in slices).

====Mexico====

The most common Mexican sausage by far is &quot;chorizo&quot;. It is fresh and usually deep red in color (in most of the rest of Latin America, chorizo is uncolored and coarsely chopped). Some chorizo is so loose that it spills out of its casing as soon as it is cut; this crumbled &quot;chorizo&quot; is a popular filling for torta sandwiches, eggs, breakfast burritos and tacos. &quot;Salchichas&quot;, &quot;longaniza&quot; (a long, thin, lightly spiced, coarse chopped pork sausage), moronga (a type of blood pudding) and head cheese are also widely consumed.

====El Salvador====

In El Salvador, chorizos are quite common, and the ones from the city of Cojutepeque are particularly well known there. The links, especially of those from Cojutepeque, are separated with corn husks tied in knots (see photo). Like most chorizos in Latin America, they are sold raw and must be cooked.

===North America===

North American breakfast or country sausage is made from uncooked ground pork, breadcrumbs and salt mixed with pepper, sage, and other spices. It is widely sold in grocery stores in a large synthetic plastic casing, or in links which may have a protein casing. It is also available sold by the pound without a casing. It can often be found on a smaller scale in rural regions, especially in southern states, where it is either in fresh patties or in links with either natural or synthetic casings as well as smoked. This sausage is most similar to English-style sausages and has been made in the United States since colonial days. It is commonly sliced into small patties and pan-fried, or cooked and crumbled into scrambled eggs or gravy. Other uncooked sausages are available in certain regions in link form, including Italian, bratwurst, chorizo, and linguica.

Several varieties of meat-and-grain sausages developed in the US. Scrapple is a pork-and-cornmeal sausage that originated in the Mid-Atlantic States. Goetta is a pork-and-oats sausage that originated in Cincinnati. Livermush, originating in North Carolina, is made with pork, liver, and cornmeal or rice. All were developed by German immigrants.

In Louisiana, there is a variety of sausage that is unique to its heritage, a variant of andouille. Unlike the original variety native to Northern France, Louisiana andouille has evolved to be made mainly of pork butt, not tripe, and tends to be spicy with a flavor far too strong for the mustard sauce that traditionally accompanies French andouille: prior to casing, the meat is heavily spiced with cayenne and black pepper. The variety from Louisiana is known as Tasso ham and is often a staple in Cajun and Creole cooking. Traditionally it is smoked over pecan wood or sugar cane as a final step before being ready to eat. In Cajun cuisine, boudin is also popular. Sausages made in the French tradition are popular in Québec, Ontario, and parts of the Prairies, where butchers offer their own variations on the classics. Locals of Flin Flon are especially fond of the Saucisse de Toulouse, which is often served with poutine.

Hot dogs, also known as frankfurters or wieners, are the most common pre-cooked sausage in the United States and Canada. Another popular variation is the corn dog, which is a hot dog that is deep fried in cornmeal batter and served on a stick. A common and popular regional sausage in New Jersey and surrounding areas is pork roll, usually thinly sliced and grilled as a breakfast meat.

Other popular ready-to-eat sausages, often eaten in sandwiches, include salami, American-style bologna, Lebanon bologna, prasky, liverwurst, and head cheese. Pepperoni and Italian sausage are popular pizza toppings.

===Oceania===

====Australia====
Australian sausages have traditionally been made with beef, pork and chicken, while recently game meats such as kangaroo have been used that typically have much less fat. English style sausages, known colloquially as &quot;snags&quot;, come in two varieties: thin, that resemble an English &#x27;breakfast&#x27; sausage, and thick, known as &#x27;Merryland&#x27; in South Australia. These types of sausage are popular at barbecues and can be purchased from any butcher or supermarket. Devon is a spiced pork sausage similar to Bologna sausage and Gelbwurst. It is usually made in a large diameter, and it is often thinly sliced and eaten cold in sandwiches.

Mettwurst and other German-style sausages are highly popular in South Australia, often made in towns like Hahndorf and Tanunda, due to the large German immigration to the state during early settlement. Mettwurst is usually sliced and eaten cold on sandwiches or alone as a snack. A local variation on cabanossi, developed by Italian migrants after World War II using local cuts of meat, is a popular snack at parties. The Don small goods company developed a spiced snack-style sausage based on the cabanossi in 1991 called Twiggy Sticks.

In Australia it is common to eat a sausage on a single slice of bread topped with onions and either tomato or barbeque sauce. This food item is known as a sausage sizzle.

==Vegetarian versions==

Vegetarian and vegan sausages are also available in some countries, or can be made from scratch at home. These may be made from tofu, seitan, nuts, pulses, mycoprotein, soya protein, vegetables or any combination of similar ingredients that will hold together during cooking. These sausages, like most meat-replacement products, generally fall into two categories: some are shaped, colored, flavored, and spiced to replicate the taste and texture of meat as accurately as possible; others such as the Glamorgan sausage rely on spices and vegetables to lend their natural flavor to the product and no attempt is made to imitate meat. While not vegetarian, the soya sausage was invented 1916 in Germany. First known as &quot;Kölner Wurst&quot; (&quot;Cologne Sausage&quot;) by later German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer (1876–1967).

<text>Interstate 99 (I-99) is an Interstate Highway in the United States with two segments: one located in central Pennsylvania and the other in northern Pennsylvania into southern New York along US 15. The southern terminus of the route is near exit 146 of the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-70/I-76) north of Bedford, where the road continues south as U.S. Route 220 (US 220). The northern terminus of the Pennsylvania segment is at an at-grade intersection with Musser Lane near I-80 near Bellefonte. The northern segment is entirely concurrent with US 15, beginning at I-180 in Williamsport northward into New York to an interchange with I-86 in Corning. Within Pennsylvania, I-99 passes through Altoona and State College—the latter home to the Pennsylvania State University—and is entirely concurrent with US 220. 

In November 2024, the northern segment was extended down US 15 to I-180 in Williamsport, entirely concurrent with US 15. Long-term plans call for the two segments of I-99 to be connected using portions of I-80 and US 220 through Pennsylvania. The only current progress on the connection is the direct access interchange at I-80.

Unlike most Interstate Highway numbers, which were assigned by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) to fit into a grid, I-99&#x27;s number was written into Section 332 of the National Highway System Designation Act of 1995 by Bud Shuster, then-chair of the US House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, the bill&#x27;s sponsor, and the representative of the district through which the highway runs. I-99 breaks the AASHTO numbering pattern associated with Interstate Highways, as it would be expected to lie east of I-97 but instead lies east of I-79 and west of I-81.

===Southern segment===

I-99 begins at an indirect interchange with US 220 and the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-70/I-76) north of Bedford. It begins concurrent with US 220, which continues south from the interchange toward the Maryland state line as a two-lane highway known as the Appalachian Thruway. To access the turnpike, drivers are required to use a short segment of US 220 Business (US 220 Bus.). North of the turnpike junction, the freeway becomes the Bud Shuster Highway as it heads through a rural portion of Bedford County. It connects to Pennsylvania Route 56 (PA 56) just west of Bedford County Airport at exit 3 and PA 869 at exit 7 before crossing into Blair County. Here, it meets PA 164 north of East Freedom at exit 23 prior to entering the Altoona area.

In Hollidaysburg, a borough south of the city, I-99 and US 220 connect to US 22 at exit 28, a large modified trumpet interchange. This junction allows travelers to head west toward Ebensburg, Johnstown, and Pittsburgh. The freeway continues to Altoona itself, where it indirectly connects to PA 36 via exit 32. Unlike the original routing of US 220 which goes through the city center, I-99 and US 220 mostly bypass it to the east, connecting to the city via streets leading eastward from the downtown district. At the northern edge of Altoona, PA 764 joins the old alignment of US 220 and parallels I-99 north for toward Bellwood. PA 764 leaves old US 220 about south of Bellwood, however, and terminates at I-99 exit 39. Bellwood itself is served by exit 41, which leads to PA 865.
The highway veers northeastward from Bellwood to serve the borough of Tyrone, located at the junction of old US 220 and PA 453. Access to the borough is made by way of exit 48, which serves PA 453. Past Tyrone, I-99 and US 220 head through sparsely populated areas of Blair and Centre counties. For this reason, only three exits exist between Tyrone and State College: exit 52, serving PA 350 and the small community of Bald Eagle, and exits 61 and 62, which connect to US 322 and the borough of Port Matilda. Here, US 322 joins I-99 and US 220 and follows them eastward to the State College area.
At exit 68 (US 322 Bus.), I-99 merges into the Mount Nittany Expressway, an older, northerly bypass of State College. I-99, US 220, and US 322 follow the expressway to the Mount Nittany Interchange, a directional T interchange located on the northern fringe of the Pennsylvania State University campus. Beaver Stadium, the home of the Penn State Nittany Lions football team, is visible from I-99 at this point. US 322 continues east through the interchange to follow the Mount Nittany Expressway while I-99 and US 220 split from US 322 and head northeastward toward Pleasant Gap, which I-99 connects to via exit 81 and PA 26. At this point, PA 26 joins the freeway and follows it to Bellefonte, served by exit 83 and PA 550. The southern segment of I-99 ends about later at an intersection with Musser Lane though the divided highway continues northeast to an interchange with I-80, where PA 26 continues north and US 220 joins I-80 east.

===Northern segment===
The northern segment of I-99 is entirely concurrent with US 15 and starts at the junction of US 220, US 15, and I-180. I-99 crosses through mountainous terrain in Lycoming and Tioga counties, bypassing Mansfield. The route crosses the Pennsylvania–New York border north of Lawrenceville, Pennsylvania. A four-lane freeway through the Steuben County town of Lindley, I-99 crosses through a rock cut, making a large bend to the north and bypassing the hamlet of Presho. The freeway enters a partial cloverleaf interchange with County Route 5 (CR 5; Smith Road). After CR 5, I-99 turns northeast through the town of Erwin, running to the west of the Indian Hills Golf Club. Making a gradual bend further to the northeast, the freeway crosses the Canisteo River and enters the hamlet of Erwins, where it enters a diamond interchange with New York State Route 417 (NY 417; Addison Road). After NY 417, it then turns alongside Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s Southern Tier Line (former Erie Railroad main line). Now paralleling the tracks and NY 417, I-99/US 15 crosses through Erwin, entering exit 11, which connects to NY 417 once again, next to Gang Mills Yard, the site of former Painted Post station.
After Gang Mills Yard, I-99 crosses through the Gang Mills section of Erwin, entering a large interchange at the northern end of the neighborhood. Signed exit 12, this interchange serves CR 107 (Robert Dann Drive) via NY 417. After CR 107, I-99 enters a large interchange that utilizes several flyover ramps between I-99, US 15, I-86, and NY 17 (Southern Tier Expressway). Ramps are also present, connecting to NY 352. This interchange serves as the northern terminus of both I-99 and US 15.

==History==
===Origins===

Corridor O of the Appalachian Development Highway System was assigned in 1965, running from Cumberland, Maryland (Corridor E, now I-68) to Bellefonte (I-80) along US 220. The portion in Pennsylvania, from Bedford north to Bald Eagle, was upgraded to a freeway in stages from the 1960s to the 1990s. The first section, from US 30 in Bedford to PA 56 near Cessna, opened in the latter half of the 1960s. Two more sections—from PA 56 north to modern exit 15 in Blair County and from Charlottsville (exit 45) to Bald Eagle—were completed in the 1970s. The portion between exit 15 and Altoona (exit 33) was finished in the 1980s while the segment between modern exits 33 and 45 was opened by 1997.
In 1991, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) was signed into law. It included a number of High Priority Corridors, one of which—Corridor 9—ran along US 220 from Bedford to Williamsport, and then north on US 15 to Corning, New York. The National Highway System Designation Act of 1995 amended ISTEA; among these amendments were that &quot;the portion of the route referred to in subsection (c)(9) [Corridor 9] is designated as Interstate Route I-99.&quot; This was the first interstate highway number to be written into law rather than to be assigned by AASHTO. The number was specified by Representative Bud Shuster, who said that the standard spur numbering was not &quot;catchy&quot;; instead, I-99 was named after a street car, No. 99, that took people from Shuster&#x27;s hometown of Glassport to McKeesport. I-99 breaks the AASHTO numbering pattern associated with interstate highways, since it lies east of I-79 but west of I-81 (the number suggests it would be located very close to the Atlantic Ocean, east of I-95).

===Designation and Bald Eagle Mountain===
On November 6, 1998, AASHTO formally approved the I-99 designation, which initially extended from the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Bedford to PA 350 in Bald Eagle. In 2002, plans were set in motion to extend I-99 northeast from Bald Eagle to State College via Port Matilda. The extension was fraught with issues, however. The proposed alignment for the highway north to Port Matilda proved to be controversial: while environmentalists called for I-99 to be constructed in the valley below Bald Eagle Mountain, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and valley residents favored a routing that took the freeway above the valley and along the side of the ridge. Farther north, the widening of Skytop, the mountain cut that US 322 uses to traverse Bald Eagle Mountain, resulted in the exposure of acidic pyrite rock in 2003.
Work on the segment ceased one year later as PennDOT attempted to stop the flow of acidic runoff from the site. The state remedied the situation by removing of pyrite and replacing it with a mix of limestone and fill, a process that took two years and cost $83 million (equivalent to $ million in ). With the environmental issues settled, construction resumed on the portion of the freeway south of Skytop Mountain. The section from Bald Eagle to Port Matilda was opened to traffic on December 17, 2007, while the remaining section between Port Matilda and the west end of the Mount Nittany Expressway near State College was completely opened on November 17, 2008. In all, the 18-mile Bald Eagle–State College section of I-99 cost $631 million (equivalent to $ million in ) to construct.

I-99 was extended northeastward to meet I-80 northeast of Bellefonte following the completion of the Bald Eagle–State College segment. The connection was made by way of the preexisting Mount Nittany Expressway and another, unnamed limited-access highway connecting the State College bypass to the Bellefonte area. The portion of the latter highway north of the PA 26 interchange was originally built in the 1970s as a two-lane freeway connecting Pleasant Gap to I-80. At the time, it was designated solely as PA 26. It was widened to four lanes in 1997. The piece connecting the PA 26 freeway to the Mount Nittany Expressway was completed in 2002. US 220 was rerouted via US 322 and the new road, and the old alignment of US 220 north of US 322 was designated US 220 Alternate (US 220 Alt.) on May 30, 2003. This extension, however, did not include an interchange with I-80, resulting in I-99 terminating at an at-grade intersection with Musser Lane just before reaching I-80.

Further north, one short segment of two-lane highway remained between Lawrenceville, Pennsylvania, and Presho, New York, almost entirely within New York. In the early 2010s, of new freeway was constructed to connect the existing freeway segments. This provided through traffic with a continuous freeway from Williamsport, Pennsylvania, to Corning, New York, and removed traffic from the overburdened two-lane section of US 15, which was retired to county route status as CR 115. On June 27, 2014, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the interstate-grade US 15 freeway from the Pennsylvania border to I-86 in Corning was officially signed as I-99.

==Future==

Though there is no specific date for completion, long-term plans call for the two segments of I-99 to be connected via US 220 from Bellefonte to Williamsport, running concurrent with I-80 as US 220 currently does, and continue northward along US 15 from Williamsport to the New York border. The entire portion of US 15 involved has been upgraded to Interstate Highway standards in anticipation of the I-99 designation, but some sections of US 220 still require upgrades, primarily in the vicinity of both interchanges with I-80 and between Jersey Shore and Linden. Signs have been erected along the present US 220 and US 15 between Bellefonte and Corning marking the route as the &quot;Future I-99 Corridor&quot;. Some of this section of road has also received exit number designations.

PennDOT has plans to build a high-speed interchange connecting I-99 to I-80 near Bellefonte. The new interchange will eliminate local access between PA 26 (Jacksonville Road) and I-80, which will be provided by a new exit to the east. The first phase of the project built the local access interchange between PA 26 and I-80. Construction on the local access interchange began on July 27, 2020. The local access interchange was opened to traffic on November 10, 2022, with a ribbon-cutting ceremony held. The local access interchange between PA 26 and I-80 was funded in part by a $35-million federal grant, with a total estimated cost of $52 million. The second phase of the project will make improvements to Jacksonville Road between the new interchange and the junction between I-80, and the third phase will build the high-speed interchange between I-80 and I-99. Bidding on the second and third phases was planned to begin in March 2022, with the improvements to Jacksonville Road to be finished by December 2023 and the high-speed interchange to be completed by December 2025. However, the bids for the other phases had not been released as of May 2023. , bidding began on the final phases. The second phase, the Jacksonville Road (PA 26) project is expected to take two years, cost $6.9 million and completion is now scheduled for the middle of 2026. Completion of the third and final phase, the $246 million high-speed interchange, is now expected in 2030.

During a 2002 taskforce meeting for I-99, it was suggested that I-390, which extends north from I-86 west of the I-86/I-99 junction near Corning and which crosses I-90 and terminates in the greater Rochester metropolitan area, be redesignated as I-99 once the I-80 to I-86 portion of that route is completed. The idea posits that I-390 is a logical extension of the I-99 corridor because I-99&#x27;s predecessor, US 15, originally extended to Rochester. No official moves to accomplish this have been taken.

<text>Interstate 5 (I-5) is the main north–south Interstate Highway on the West Coast of the United States, running largely parallel to the Pacific coast of the contiguous U.S. from Mexico to Canada. It travels through the states of California, Oregon, and Washington, serving several large cities on the West Coast, including San Diego, Los Angeles, Sacramento, Portland, and Seattle. It is the only continuous Interstate highway to touch both the Mexican and Canadian borders. Upon crossing the Mexican border at its southern terminus, the highway continues to Tijuana, Baja California, as Mexican Federal Highway 1 (Fed. 1). Upon crossing the Canadian border at its northern terminus, it continues to Vancouver as British Columbia Highway 99 (BC 99).

I-5 was originally created in 1956 as part of the Interstate Highway System, but it was predated by several auto trails and highways built in the early 20th century. The Pacific Highway was built in the 1910s and 1920s by the states of California, Oregon, and Washington, and was later incorporated into U.S. Route 99 (US 99) in 1926. I-5 largely follows the route of US 99, with the exception of portions south of Los Angeles and in the Central Valley of California. The freeway was built in segments between 1956 and 1978, including expressway sections of US 99 that were built earlier to bypass various towns along the route. US 99 was removed in 1972.

I-5 is a major Interstate Highway that spans and runs north–south through the West Coast states of California, Oregon, and Washington. It connects several major metropolitan areas as well as agricultural regions, seaports, and freight destinations. The freeway ranges from four lanes in some rural sections to 22 lanes in Orange County, California, where it had been widened and reconstructed.

===California===
The southern terminus of I-5 is at the Mexican border at the San Ysidro Port of Entry, the busiest land border crossing in the Western Hemisphere; the crossing handles a daily average of 70,000 vehicles and 20,000 pedestrians crossing northbound and connects with Mexican Federal Highway 1 in Tijuana. The freeway splits in San Diego&#x27;s San Ysidro neighborhood, with I-5 traveling northwest through Chula Vista and National City on the John J. Montgomery Freeway and I-805 serving the eastern neighborhoods. I-5 follows the shore of San Diego Bay and intersects State Route 15 (a continuation of I-15) near Naval Station San Diego. The freeway then travels around downtown San Diego and San Diego International Airport before reaching a junction with I-8.

I-5 bisects the University of California, San Diego campus, merging with I-805 nearby, and follows the Pacific coastline through the northern suburbs of San Diego. Between Oceanside and San Clemente, an stretch of the San Diego Freeway passes through Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton before entering Orange County. At Dana Point, I-5 turns inland and heads north through Mission Viejo to the El Toro Y interchange in Irvine, where I-405 splits and carries the San Diego Freeway designation. I-5 continues northwest as the Santa Ana Freeway through several Orange County and Los Angeles County suburbs and passes near Disneyland in Anaheim. The freeway intersects I-605 in Downey and I-710 in Commerce before reaching the city of Los Angeles. Southern Californians often refer to I-5 as &quot;the 5&quot; or as the Santa Ana Freeway in the Los Angeles area.

At the East Los Angeles Interchange near downtown Los Angeles, I-5 intersects US 101 and begins a short concurrency with I-10 on a section of the Golden State Freeway. The freeway splits from and turns northwest to follow the Los Angeles River through Glendale and into Burbank. I-5 then leaves the river and travels across the San Fernando Valley, later crossing the Newhall Pass through the Santa Susana Mountains to reach the Santa Clarita Valley; the Newhall Pass interchange with State Route 14 is notable for having separate lanes for truck traffic. The freeway passes the city of Santa Clarita and ascends into the Sierra Pelona Mountains, where the northbound and southbound lanes separate and cross sides for approximately . The northbound ascent includes a continuous 5 percent grade for . After passing Pyramid Lake, I-5 makes several turns as it follows a series of narrow valleys to reach the second-highest point of its entire length, Tejon Pass (elevation ) in the Tehachapi Mountains.

The freeway then traverses the narrow Grapevine Canyon and descends for into the San Joaquin Valley. At Wheeler Ridge near the south end of the valley, State Route 99 splits from the freeway to serve Bakersfield and other major cities in the Central Valley, while I-5 stays to the west. Now named the West Side Freeway, I-5 travels northwest along the edge of the Central Valley through farmland and avoids populated areas. The freeway is connected to several of the valley&#x27;s main cities, including Fresno, Merced, and Modesto, by other highways.

Near Tracy, I-580 splits from I-5 to provide the first of several connections to the San Francisco Bay Area; I-205 northeast of Tracy also provides a connection through I-580. The freeway continues north through Stockton to Sacramento, where it follows the Sacramento River through the southern suburbs and along the edge of downtown. I-5 intersects two transcontinental highways in the Sacramento area: US 50 (and unsigned I-305) south of downtown and I-80 in the northern suburbs. After an unsigned concurrency with State Route 99 in northern Sacramento, the freeway turns west to pass the city&#x27;s airport and resumes its northwestern path at Woodland. It then intersects I-505, another Bay Area connector, near Dunnigan.

The freeway continues north along the western edge of the Sacramento Valley, passing through farmland and several small towns before reaching the end of the valley at Red Bluff. I-5 then traverses the rugged Shasta Cascade region, passing through Redding and crossing Shasta Lake before beginning its ascent towards Mount Shasta. The freeway follows the Sacramento River upstream to the southwestern slopes of the mountain and turns northwest to reach Weed, where it intersects US 97, a major highway serving the Inland Northwest region. I-5 continues through Yreka in the Shasta Valley and follows the Klamath River into the Siskiyou Mountains, where it crosses into Oregon.

===Oregon===
I-5 enters Oregon near Siskiyou Summit, which sits at and is the highest point on the highway. From the summit, I-5 descends by over at a 6 percent grade to reach the Rogue Valley. The freeway passes through Ashland and Medford, running parallel to Oregon Route 99, and turns west to follow the Rogue River to Grants Pass, where it intersects US 199. I-5 then turns north and crosses a series of passes in the Klamath Mountains to reach the Umpqua Valley, where it follows the South Umpqua River to Roseburg.

The highway enters the Willamette Valley near Cottage Grove and forms the boundary between the cities of Eugene and Springfield. After crossing the Willamette River, I-5 intersects Oregon Route 126, which carries I-105, and Oregon Route 569; both highways provide connections to Eugene and Springfield. I-5 then travels due north through farmland on the east side of the Willamette River, passing a junction with US 20 in Albany, and bisects eastern Salem near the state capitol campus. It is connected to downtown Salem by Oregon Route 22 and the Salem Parkway, which joins I-5 as the freeway crosses the 45th parallel near Keizer.

From Salem, I-5 turns northeast and passes Woodburn before crossing the Willamette River on the Boone Bridge in Wilsonville, at the south end of the Portland metropolitan area. The freeway travels through the southern suburbs of Portland, intersecting I-205 in Tualatin and Oregon Route 217 in Tigard before entering the city proper. I-5 then turns northeast to follow Barbur Boulevard (part of Route 99W) and navigate the Terwilliger curves. The freeway continues north through the South Waterfront neighborhood, crossing under the Portland Aerial Tram and the western approach to the Ross Island Bridge (carrying US 26) before reaching an interchange with I-405.

I-5 and I-405 form a complete loop around downtown Portland, with I-5 crossing the Willamette River on the Marquam Bridge to run along the eastern riverfront. The freeway has interchanges with several major bridges crossing the Willamette, as well as the western terminus of I-84 near the Oregon Convention Center. From the I-84 interchange to a second junction with I-405 near the Fremont Bridge, I-5 is concurrent with US 30, which continues west towards Astoria. Through North Portland, the freeway runs below street level until it crosses the Columbia Slough to bisect Delta Park. continues across Hayden Island to the Interstate Bridge, a pair of vertical-lift bridges which carry the highway over the Columbia River into Washington state.

===Washington===
The highway enters Vancouver at the north end of the Interstate Bridge and immediately intersects Washington State Route 14 near the Fort Vancouver National Historic Site. The freeway passes near downtown Vancouver and continues north through the city&#x27;s suburbs before being rejoined by I-205 at Salmon Creek. I-5 travels north along the Columbia River to Kelso and Longview, where it switches to following the Cowlitz River between the Willapa Hills and Cascade foothills. The freeway then turns northwest to traverse a prairie and the adjacent cities of Chehalis and Centralia while concurrent with US 12.

I-5 continues north to a junction with US 101 in Tumwater, near Olympia and the state capitol campus. The freeway skirts the southeast side of downtown Olympia and turns east to cross Joint Base Lewis–McChord (formerly Fort Lewis and McChord Air Force Base). I-5 then turns north to enter Tacoma but bends east to intersect I-705, a short spur into downtown Tacoma. The freeway turns north again after leaving Tacoma and its nearby seaport near Fife to traverse the suburbs of South King County. I-5 intersects its eastern bypass of Seattle, I-405, in Tukwila near Seattle–Tacoma International Airport.

The freeway generally follows the Green and Duwamish rivers into Seattle, passing Boeing Field and the industrial district in the process. I-5 intersects I-90 near Seattle&#x27;s Chinatown–International District on the south side of downtown Seattle. The freeway turns northwest and bisects downtown Seattle in a trench, with some sections covered by Freeway Park and the Washington State Convention Center. It then turns north to intersect Washington State Route 520 near Eastlake and crosses the Ship Canal Bridge over Portage Bay, which lies between Lake Union and Lake Washington. I-5 continues through northern Seattle, passing the University District near the University of Washington campus and Green Lake before leaving the city. The section between downtown Seattle and Northgate includes a set of reversible express lanes that add extra capacity in the peak direction of travel.

I-5 continues through the northern suburbs of Seattle and turns northeasterly in Lynnwood, where it is rejoined by I-405, which serves the Eastside region. The freeway travels north through Everett, skirting the city&#x27;s downtown and intersecting US 2, and leaves the Seattle metropolitan area for the rural Skagit Valley. I-5 descends into the valley and travels through Mount Vernon and Burlington before climbing into the Chuckanut Mountains, where it turns west towards Bellingham Bay (part of the Salish Sea). The freeway travels around downtown Bellingham and turns northwest to continue across the rural Fraser Lowland. I-5 terminates at the Peace Arch Border Crossing on the Canadian border, adjacent to the eponymous monument, in Blaine. The highway becomes British Columbia Highway 99, which continues northwest to Vancouver.

==History==
An extensive section of this highway (over ), from approximately Stockton, California, to Portland, Oregon, follows the track of the Siskiyou Trail. This trail was based on an older network of Native American footpaths connecting the Pacific Northwest with California&#x27;s Central Valley. By the 1820s, trappers from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company were the first non-Native Americans to use the route of today&#x27;s I-5 to move between today&#x27;s Washington state and California. During the second half of the 19th century, mule trains, stagecoaches, and the Central Pacific railroad also followed the route of the Siskiyou Trail. By the early 20th century, pioneering automobile roads were built along the path of the Siskiyou Trail, notably the Pacific Highway. The Pacific Highway ran from British Columbia to San Diego, California, and was the immediate predecessor of much of US 99. The route of US 99 was in turn used as a basis for much of the route of today&#x27;s I-5.

A major deviation from the old US 99 route is the Westside Freeway portion of I-5 in California&#x27;s Central Valley. To provide a faster and more direct north–south route through the state, the decision was made to build a new freeway to the west and bypass Fresno, Bakersfield, and the rest of population centers in the area instead of upgrading the existing highway (which was re-designated as part of SR 99).
This re-route through California&#x27;s Central Valley was the last section of I-5 to be constructed, with the final segment dedicated and opened to traffic near Stockton, California, on October 12, 1979. Representatives from both Canada and Mexico attended the dedication to commemorate the first contiguous freeway connecting the North American countries. It cost an estimated $2.3 billion in 1979 dollars (equivalent to $ in dollars) to construct all of I-5.

This direct route also bypasses San Francisco and the rest of the San Francisco Bay Area. Original plans called for a loop Interstate with a directional suffix, I-5W. This route now roughly corresponds to I-580 from I-5 south of Tracy to Oakland, I-80 from Oakland to Vacaville, and I-505 from Vacaville to I-5 near Dunnigan. I-5W and most of the other Interstates around the country with directional suffixes were eventually renumbered or eliminated. Nevertheless, San Francisco is still listed as a control city on northbound I-5 between SR 99 and I-580.

By the early 21st century, sections of I-5 had deteriorated due to a maintenance backlog as well as high traffic volumes. Several bridges in Oregon were reconstructed or repaired to accommodate use by heavy freight vehicles.

On May 23, 2013, a bridge span collapsed over the Skagit River in Mount Vernon, Washington, sending two cars into the water and requiring traffic in both directions to bypass the crossing. The Washington State Department of Transportation used a temporary structure to restore access across the river while a permanent bridge replacement was built. That process was completed September 15, 2013.

On December 18, 2017, an Amtrak train derailed on an overpass crossing I-5 near Tacoma, Washington, and blocked several lanes of traffic.

The I-5 corridor forms part of the West Coast Electric Highway, a partnership between the states of California, Oregon, and Washington to build and maintain a network of charging stations for electric vehicles. The pact was formed in 2009 and the first charging stations—spaced apart—opened in 2011. In 2019, the three states also broke ground on a similar charging network for electric trucks along I-5 called the West Coast Clean Transit Corridor Initiative. The program is a collaboration of nine utilities and two agencies representing municipal utilities, and aims to enable electric freight and delivery trucks to operate along the entire West Coast corridor.

* Los Angeles and Orange County, California—I-405
* Los Angeles and Orange County, California—I-605
* Tracy, California—I-205
* Sacramento, California—I-305 (unsigned)
* Zamora, California—I-505
* Eugene, Oregon—I-105
* Portland, Oregon—I-405
* Portland, Oregon, and Vancouver, Washington—I-205

I-5 will have a complete set of auxiliary routes (i.e. 105, 205, 305, 405, 505, 605, 705, 805, 905), with the completion of I-905 in San Diego County. Currently, I-80 and I-90 are the only two Interstates to have complete sets of auxiliary routes.

Several routes, including I-305 and I-505 in Oregon, were planned but left unbuilt due to local opposition.
