<text>Lewis Brian Hopkin Jones (28 February 1942 – 3 July 1969) was an English musician and founder of the Rolling Stones. Initially a slide guitarist, he went on to sing backing vocals and played a wide variety of instruments on Rolling Stones recordings and in concerts.

After he founded the Rolling Stones as a British blues outfit in 1962 and gave the band its name, Jones&#x27;s fellow band members Keith Richards and Mick Jagger began to take over the band&#x27;s musical direction, especially after they became a successful songwriting team.

When Jones developed alcohol and drug problems, his performance in the studio became increasingly unreliable, leading to a diminished role within the band he had founded. In June 1969, the Rolling Stones dismissed Jones; guitarist Mick Taylor took his place in the group. Less than a month later, Jones died by drowning at the age of 27 in the swimming pool at his home at Cotchford Farm, East Sussex. His death was referenced in songs by many other pop bands, and Pete Townshend and Jim Morrison wrote poems about it. In 1989, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Rolling Stones.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Lewis Brian Hopkin Jones was born in the Park Nursing Home in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, on Saturday, 28 February 1942. An attack of croup at the age of four left Jones with asthma that lasted for the rest of his life. His middle-class parents, Lewis Blount Jones and Louisa Beatrice Jones (&quot;née&quot; Simmonds), were of Welsh descent. Brian had two sisters: Pamela, who was born on 3 October 1943 and died on 14 October 1945 of leukaemia; and Barbara, who was born on 22 August 1946.

Jones attended local schools, including Dean Close School from September 1949 to July 1953; and Cheltenham Grammar School for Boys, (now Pate&#x27;s Grammar School) which he entered in September 1953 after passing the eleven-plus exam. He enjoyed badminton and diving at school and became first clarinet in the school orchestra. Jones reportedly obtained seven O-level passes in 1957, thence continuing into the sixth form and obtaining a further two O-levels. He passed A-levels in physics and chemistry, but he failed in biology.

Jones was able to perform well in exams despite a lack of academic effort. However, he found school regimented and disliked school uniforms and conformism in general; Jones himself said: &quot;When I made the sixth form, I found myself accepted by the older boys; suddenly I was in.&quot; His hostility to authority figures resulted in his suspension from school on two occasions. According to Dick Hattrell, a childhood friend, &quot;He was a rebel without a cause, but when examinations came he was brilliant.&quot;

Both Jones&#x27;s parents were interested in music; his father was a piano teacher in addition to his job as an aeronautical engineer, and his mother played the piano and organ and led the choir at the local church. Jones listened to classical music as a child but preferred blues, particularly Elmore James and Robert Johnson. In 1957, he first heard Cannonball Adderley&#x27;s music and took an interest in jazz. Jones persuaded his parents to buy him a saxophone, and two years later, his parents gave him his first acoustic guitar as a 17th birthday present. Jones began performing at local blues and jazz clubs while busking and working odd jobs. He reportedly stole small amounts of money from work to pay for cigarettes, for which he was sacked.

=== Relationships and fatherhood ===
Jones&#x27;s first child was born in 1958 to a female friend. The baby, of unknown sex, was given up for adoption and, in contrast to Jones&#x27;s other children, has either not learned of the relationship to Jones, or has not publicly identified himself or herself as Jones&#x27;s child.

In the summer of 1959, Jones&#x27;s girlfriend – a Cheltenham schoolgirl named Valerie Corbett – became pregnant. Although Jones purportedly encouraged her to have an abortion, she carried the child to term, giving birth on 29 May 1960 and naming him Barry David. She soon placed the baby for adoption. The adoptive parents renamed the boy Simon. During this period, Jones lived a bohemian lifestyle abroad, busking with his guitar on the streets for money and living off the charity of others. Eventually, he ran short of money and returned to England.

In November 1959, Jones went to the Wooden Bridge Hotel in Guildford to see a band perform. He met a young married woman named Angeline, and the two had a one-night stand that resulted in her pregnancy. Angeline and her husband decided to raise the baby, Belinda, born on 4 August 1960. Jones never knew about the pregnancy or her birth.

In 1961, Jones applied for a scholarship to Cheltenham Art College. He was initially accepted, but the offer was withdrawn two days later after an unidentified acquaintance wrote to the college, calling Jones &quot;an irresponsible drifter&quot;. Later that year, on 22 October, Jones&#x27;s girlfriend Pat Andrews gave birth to his fourth known child, Julian Mark Andrews (known as Mark). Jones moved in with them and sold his record collection to buy flowers for Andrews and clothes for the newborn. In a television interview Andrews stated that in the early days of their relationship, although she and Jones were both working, his interest in the guitar meant he did not have much money to buy food or anything beyond paying the rent. According to Andrews, Jones was initially proud of Mark, but when the Rolling Stones acquired a manager, Jones was instructed not to be seen with either mother or child. Jones agreed she said, telling her she would have to &quot;put up with it for a few months&quot; until the band had had some success. However, once the Stones did become successful, she noted Jones &quot;just seemed to drift away&quot;, becoming more interested in famous people he met, and that she &quot;never received a penny from Brian at all&quot;. In the same interview, Andrews also noted she felt sorry for Jones as &quot;he just uses people&quot;.

In early 1963, Jones began a relationship with Linda Lawrence. On 23 July 1964, Lawrence gave birth to Jones&#x27;s fifth child, Julian Brian Lawrence. Lawrence later married Scottish folk/pop singer Donovan. They raised Julian together, changing his name to Julian Leitch.

In early October 1964, Jones&#x27;s occasional girlfriend, Dawn Molloy, announced to Jones and the Rolling Stones&#x27; management that she was pregnant by him. She received a cheque for £700 () from group manager Andrew Loog Oldham. In return, she signed an agreement that the matter was now closed and that she would make no statement about Jones or the child to the public or the press. The undated statement was signed by Molloy and witnessed by Mick Jagger. Molloy eventually gave the boy, whom she named Paul Andrew, up for adoption, and his new parents renamed him John Maynard.

In 1965, Jones met German singer Nico and began a three-month relationship with her. Jones introduced Nico to Andy Warhol and recommended she show him her music; through this she later received her role in The Velvet Underground. She became pregnant during the affair but decided to have an abortion in London that same year. The two remained friends.

A year later, while on tour, Jones met Italian-German model and actress Anita Pallenberg backstage and began a significant relationship with her. Jones became extremely abusive, at one point breaking his hand on Pallenberg&#x27;s face. In 1967, Pallenberg left Jones for his bandmate Keith Richards, which added to tensions between the bandmates.

Jones had subsequent relationships with English model Suki Potier and Swedish seamstress Anna Wohlin, as well as a short relationship in 1968 with American model Donyale Luna, who appeared with him in the concert film &quot;The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus&quot; several months before his death. Wohlin was living with Jones in 1969 when he died and has written two books about her time with him. Wohlin has stated that during his last year Jones had expressed immense guilt over not being there for his children. He wished to start over and become a &quot;real father&quot; and raise future children in the house he had bought. He also wished for his sons, who had not been adopted away by their mothers, Mark and Julian, to come and live in the house.

Jones&#x27;s youngest known child is a daughter named Barbara Anna Marion, born in 1969 to Elizabeth, a married American woman who raised the girl with her husband. Barbara has appeared in a 2019 documentary about Jones&#x27;s death.

Wohlin stated in her first book that she miscarried a girl in August 1969. She has referred to the baby as Johanna, a name she and Jones had picked out previously for when they had a daughter while planning for a family.

===Forming the Rolling Stones===

Jones left Cheltenham and moved to London, where he became friends with fellow musicians Alexis Korner, future Manfred Mann singer Paul Jones, future Cream bassist Jack Bruce, and others who made up the small London rhythm and blues and jazz scene. He became a blues musician, for a brief time calling himself &quot;Elmo Lewis&quot; and playing slide guitar. He also started a group with Paul Jones called the Roosters. In January 1963, after both Joneses left the group, Eric Clapton took over Brian&#x27;s position as guitarist.

Jones placed an advertisement in the 2 May 1962 edition of &quot;Jazz News&quot;, a Soho club information sheet, inviting musicians to audition for a new R&amp;B group at the Bricklayer&#x27;s Arms pub; pianist Ian Stewart was the first to respond. Later, singer Mick Jagger also joined this band; Jagger and his childhood friend Keith Richards had met Jones when he and Paul were playing Robert Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Dust My Broom&quot; with Korner&#x27;s band at the Ealing Jazz Club. Jagger brought guitarist Richards to rehearsals; Richards then joined the band. Jones&#x27;s and Stewart&#x27;s acceptance of Richards and the Chuck Berry songs he wanted to play coincided with the departure of blues purists guitarist Geoff Bradford and singer Brian Knight, who had no tolerance for Chuck Berry.

As Richards tells it, Jones came up with the name the &quot;Rollin&#x27; Stones&quot; (later with the &#x27;g&#x27;) while on the phone with a venue owner. &quot;The voice on the other end of the line obviously said, &#x27;What are you called?&#x27; Panic! &quot;The Best of Muddy Waters&quot; album was lying on the floor—and track five, side one was &#x27;Rollin&#x27; Stone Blues&#x27;&quot;. The Rollin&#x27; Stones played their first gig on 12 July 1962 at the Marquee Club in London, with a line-up of Jagger, Richards, Jones, Stewart, bass player Dick Taylor (later of the Pretty Things) and drummer Tony Chapman.

From September 1962 to September 1963, Jones, Jagger and Richards shared a flat (referred to by Richards as &quot;a beautiful dump&quot;) at 102 Edith Grove, Chelsea, with James Phelge, a future photographer whose name was used in some of the group&#x27;s early &quot;Nanker/Phelge&quot; writing credits. Jones and Richards spent day after day playing guitar while listening to blues records (notably Jimmy Reed, Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon and Howlin&#x27; Wolf). During this time, Jones also taught Jagger how to play harmonica.

The four Stones went searching for a bassist and drummer, finally settling on Bill Wyman on bass because he had a spare VOX AC30 guitar amplifier and always had cigarettes, as well as a bass guitar that he had built himself. After playing with Mick Avory, Tony Chapman and Carlo Little, in January 1963 they finally persuaded jazz-influenced Charlie Watts to join them. At the time, Watts was considered by fellow musicians to be one of the better drummers in London; he had played with (among others) Alexis Korner&#x27;s group Blues Incorporated.

Watts described Jones&#x27;s role in these early days: &quot;Brian was very instrumental in pushing the band at the beginning. Keith and I would look at him and say he was barmy. It was a crusade to him to get us on the stage in a club and be paid half-a-crown and to be billed as an R&amp;B band.&quot;

While acting as the band&#x27;s business manager, Jones received £5 more than the other members (), which did not sit well with the rest of the band and created resentment. Richards has said that both he and Jagger were surprised to learn that Jones considered himself the leader and was receiving the extra £5, especially as other people, like Giorgio Gomelsky, appeared to be doing the booking.

===Musical contributions===

Jones was a gifted multi-instrumentalist, proficient on a wide variety of musical instruments. His ability to play a wide variety of instruments is most evident on the albums &quot;Aftermath&quot; (1966), &quot;Between the Buttons&quot; (1967) and &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot; (1967). As a guitarist, in the early days, he favoured a white teardrop-shaped electric guitar produced by the Vox company, especially in live performances; he also played a wide variety of electric and acoustic guitars from companies such as Rickenbacker, Gibson, and Fender. As a slide guitarist, he favoured the open E and open G tunings.

Richards maintains that what he calls &quot;guitar weaving&quot; emerged from this period, from listening to Jimmy Reed albums: &quot;We listened to the teamwork, trying to work out what was going on in those records; how you could play together with two guitars and make it sound like four or five.&quot;

===Changes in band dynamics and estrangement from bandmates===

Oldham recognised the financial advantages of band members writing their own songs, as exemplified by Lennon–McCartney, and that playing covers would not sustain a band in the limelight for long. Further, he wanted to make Jagger&#x27;s charisma and flamboyance a focus of live performances. Jones saw his influence over the Stones&#x27; direction wane as their repertoire comprised fewer blues covers than he preferred; more Jagger/Richards originals developed (although many still had a bluesy sound), and Oldham increased his own managerial control, displacing Jones from yet another role.

In March 1967, Anita Pallenberg, Jones&#x27;s girlfriend of two years, left him for Richards when Jones became violent towards her while the three were on a trip to Morocco, further damaging the already strained relations between Jones and Richards. Jones was later hospitalised in Morocco. As tensions and Jones&#x27;s substance abuse increased, his musical contributions became sporadic. He became bored with the guitar and sought exotic instruments to play, and he was increasingly absent from recording sessions. In Peter Whitehead&#x27;s promotional film for &quot;We Love You&quot;, made in July 1967, he appears extremely groggy and disoriented.

Jones was arrested for drug possession on 10 May 1967, shortly after the Redlands bust at Richards&#x27;s Sussex home. Authorities found marijuana, cocaine, and methamphetamine in his flat. He confessed to marijuana use but said he did not use hard drugs.

Hostility grew between Jones, Jagger, and Richards, alienating Jones further from the group. Although many noted that Jones could be friendly and outgoing, Wyman, Richards, and Watts have commented that he could also be cruel and difficult. By most accounts, Jones&#x27;s attitude changed frequently; he was one minute caring and generous, the next making an effort to anger everyone. As Wyman observed in &quot;Stone Alone&quot;: &quot;There were at least two sides to Brian&#x27;s personality. One Brian was introverted, shy, sensitive, [and] deep-thinking. The other was a preening peacock, gregarious, artistic, desperately needing assurance from his peers.&quot; Wyman added: &quot;He pushed every friendship to the limit and way beyond.&quot;

Charlie Watts recalled that Jones indulged in drinking and drug taking &quot;but they weren&#x27;t very good for him...he wasn&#x27;t strong enough mentally or physically to take any of it. Brian was one of those people who did everything to excess.&quot; Watts also remarked that Jones was sometimes not very pleasant and that he upset other people very easily.

Jones&#x27;s last substantial sessions with the Stones occurred in the spring and summer of 1968 when the Stones produced &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jack Flash&quot; and the &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; album. His final lead guitar part was on the song &quot;No Expectations&quot;: he plays slide guitar to Richards&#x27;s acoustic rhythm. He can be seen in the Jean-Luc Godard film &quot;One Plus One&quot; playing acoustic guitar and chatting and sharing cigarettes with Richards, although Jones is neglected in the music-making. The film chronicles the making of &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot;.

Where once Jones played multiple instruments on many tracks, he played only minor roles on a few pieces during the latter stage of his time with the band. Jones&#x27;s last formal appearance was in the December 1968 &quot;The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus&quot;, a part-concert, part circus-act film organised by the band. It went unreleased for more than 25 years because Jagger was unhappy with the band&#x27;s performance compared with others in the film, such as Jethro Tull, John Lennon, the Who, and Taj Mahal. Commentary included as bonus material indicated that almost everyone at the concert sensed that Jones&#x27;s time with the Rolling Stones was nearing an end, and Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend of the Who thought it would be his last live musical performance.

===Legal issues and departure from the Rolling Stones===
Jones was arrested a second time on 21 May 1968 for possession of cannabis, which he said had been left by previous tenants of the flat. Because he was on probation at the time, he faced a long jail sentence if found guilty. The jury found him guilty, but the judge had sympathy for Jones; instead of jailing him, he fined him £50 () plus £105 in costs () and told him: &quot;For goodness&#x27; sake, don&#x27;t get into trouble again or it really &quot;will&quot; be serious.&quot;

Jones&#x27;s legal troubles, estrangement from his bandmates, substance abuse, and mood swings became too much of an obstacle to his active participation in the band. The Rolling Stones wanted to tour the United States in 1969 for the first time in three years, but Jones was not in a fit condition to tour, and his second arrest exacerbated problems with acquiring a US work visa. In addition, Jones&#x27;s attendance at rehearsals and recording sessions had become erratic. When he did appear he either rarely contributed anything musically or, when he did, his bandmates would switch off his amplifier, leaving Richards to play nearly all the guitars. According to author Gary Herman, Jones was &quot;literally incapable of making music; when he tried to play harmonica, his mouth started bleeding&quot;.

This behaviour was problematic during the &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot; and &quot;Beggar&#x27;s Banquet&quot; sessions and had worsened by the time the band began recording &quot;Let It Bleed&quot;. In March 1969, Jones borrowed the group&#x27;s Jaguar and went shopping in Pimlico Road. After the parked car was towed away by police, Jones hired a chauffeur-driven car to get home. In May 1969, Jones crashed his motorcycle into a shop window and was secretly taken to hospital under an assumed name. From this point, he was still attending recording sessions but was no longer a major contributor to the band&#x27;s music. By May, he had made two contributions to the work in progress: autoharp on &quot;You Got the Silver&quot; and percussion on &quot;Midnight Rambler&quot;. Jagger informed Jones that he would be fired from the band if he did not turn up to a photo session. Looking frail, he nonetheless showed up, and his last photo session as a Rolling Stone took place on 21 May 1969, first at St. Katherine Docks, Tower Bridge, London, and then at Ethan Russell&#x27;s photographic studio in South Kensington. The photos would appear on the album &quot;Through the Past, Darkly (Big Hits Vol. 2)&quot; in September 1969.

The Stones decided that following the release of the &quot;Let it Bleed&quot; album (scheduled for July 1969 in the US), they would start a tour of North America in November 1969. However, the Stones&#x27; management was informed that Jones would not receive a work permit owing to his drug convictions. At the suggestion of Stewart, the Stones decided to add a new guitarist. On 8 June 1969, Jones was visited by Jagger, Richards and Watts and was told that the group he had formed would continue without him.

To the public it appeared as if Jones had left voluntarily; the other band members told him that although he was being dismissed, it was his choice how to break it to the public. Jones released a statement on 9 June 1969, announcing his departure. In this statement, he said, among other things, that &quot;I no longer see eye-to-eye with the others over the discs we are cutting.&quot; He was replaced by the 20-year-old guitarist Mick Taylor, formerly of John Mayall&#x27;s Bluesbreakers.

During the period of his decreasing involvement in the band, Jones was living at Cotchford Farm in East Sussex, the residence formerly owned by &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; author A. A. Milne, which Jones had purchased in November 1968. Alexis Korner, who visited in late June, noted that Jones seemed &quot;happier than he had ever been&quot;. Jones is known to have contacted Korner, Stewart, John Lennon, Mitch Mitchell, Alan Price, and Jimmy Miller about intentions to put together another band. Jones had apparently demoed a few of his own songs in the weeks before his death, including &quot;Has Anybody Seen My Baby?&quot; and &quot;Chow Time&quot;.

=== Death ===

At around midnight on the night of 2–3 July 1969, Jones was discovered motionless at the bottom of his swimming pool at Cotchford Farm. His Swedish girlfriend, Anna Wohlin, was convinced he was alive when he was taken out of the pool, insisting he still had a pulse. However, by the time the doctors arrived, it was too late, and he was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital at the age of 27. The coroner&#x27;s report stated it was a drowning, later clarified as &quot;death by misadventure&quot;, and noted his liver and heart were greatly enlarged by past drug and alcohol abuse.

Upon Jones&#x27;s death, the Who&#x27;s Pete Townshend wrote a poem titled &quot;A Normal Day for Brian, A Man Who Died Every Day&quot; (printed in &quot;The Times&quot;); Jimi Hendrix dedicated a song to him on US television; and Jim Morrison of the Doors published a poem titled &quot;Ode to L.A. While Thinking of Brian Jones, Deceased&quot;. Coincidentally, Hendrix and Morrison both died within the following two years, with Morrison&#x27;s death falling on the same date as Jones&#x27;s. All three died at the age of 27.

On 5 July 1969, which was only two days after Jones&#x27;s death, the Rolling Stones had been scheduled to perform a free concert in Hyde Park. The concert had originally been promoted weeks earlier as the first public appearance of Mick Taylor as the band&#x27;s new guitarist. The band decided instead to dedicate their upcoming Hyde Park performance to the memory of Jones. At the beginning of the concert, Jagger took the stage to read excerpts from &quot;Adonais&quot;, a poem by Percy Bysshe Shelley about the death of his friend John Keats. Stagehands then released hundreds of white butterflies from the stage area as a tribute to Jones. Afterwards, the band played a Johnny Winter song that was one of Jones&#x27;s favourites, &quot;I&#x27;m Yours and I&#x27;m Hers&quot;, with Taylor on slide guitar.

Jones was reportedly buried deep in Cheltenham Cemetery to prevent exhumation by trophy hunters. His body was embalmed, with hair bleached white, and was placed in an air-tight silver and bronze casket. Watts and Wyman were the only Rolling Stones who attended the funeral. Mick Jagger and Marianne Faithfull were travelling to Australia to begin the filming of &quot;Ned Kelly&quot; and stated that their contracts did not allow them to delay the trip to attend the funeral.

When asked if he felt guilty about Jones&#x27;s death, Mick Jagger told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1995: &quot;No, I don&#x27;t really. I do feel that I behaved in a very childish way, but we were very young, and in some ways, we picked on him. But, unfortunately, he made himself a target for it; he was very, very jealous, very difficult, very manipulative, and if you do that in this kind of a group of people, you get back as good as you give, to be honest. I wasn&#x27;t understanding enough about his drug addiction. No one seemed to know much about drug addiction. Things like LSD were all new. No one knew the harm. People thought cocaine was good for you.&quot;

Wyman said in 2002, &quot;As the years go by, I become even more convinced that he&#x27;s entitled to a free pardon. Brian Jones is a legend, and his legacy is there for all to hear. While the Rolling Stones damaged all of us in some way, Brian was the only one that died.&quot;

====Murder theory====
Theories surrounding Jones&#x27;s death developed soon afterwards, with associates of the Stones claiming to have information that he was murdered. According to rock biographer Philip Norman, &quot;the murder theory would bubble back to the surface every five years or so&quot;. In 1993, it was reported that Jones was murdered by Frank Thorogood, a builder who was doing construction work on the property. He was the last person to see Jones alive. Thorogood allegedly confessed the murder to the Rolling Stones&#x27; driver Tom Keylock, who later denied this. The Thorogood theory was dramatised in the 2005 film &quot;Stoned&quot;. Thorogood is alleged to have killed Jones in a fight over money; he had been paid £18,000 for work on Cotchford Farm but he wanted another £6,000. The killing is alleged to have been covered up by senior police officers when they discovered how badly the investigation into Jones&#x27;s death had been botched by the local police.

In August 2009, Sussex Police decided to conduct a case review of Jones&#x27;s death for the first time since 1969 after new evidence was handed to them by Scott Jones, an investigative journalist, who had traced many of the people who were at Brian Jones&#x27;s house the night he died. The journalist had also uncovered unseen police files held at the National Archives. In 2010, following the review, Sussex Police stated it would not be reopening the case. It asserted that &quot;this has been thoroughly reviewed by Sussex Police&#x27;s Crime Policy and Review Branch, but there is no new evidence to suggest that the coroner&#x27;s original verdict of &#x27;death by misadventure&#x27; was incorrect&quot;. Jones&#x27;s children John and Barbara believe that their father was murdered. Barbara appears in the 2019 documentary &quot;Rolling Stone: Life and Death of Brian Jones&quot; which pushes the theory of the murder.

==Songwriting credits==
Unsure and insecure as a composer, Jones was not a prolific songwriter. The 30-second &quot;Rice Krispies&quot; jingle for Kellogg&#x27;s, co-written with the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency in 1963 and performed by the Rolling Stones incognito, was credited to Jones; this did not sit well with the rest of the band, who felt it was a group effort and all should benefit equally. Jones was also included in the &quot;Nanker/Phelge&quot; songwriting credit, a pseudonym used on fourteen tracks that were composed by the entire band and Andrew Oldham.

Oldham tried to establish a songwriting partnership between Jones and Gene Pitney after &quot;becoming bored senseless by Jones&#x27;s bleating about the potential of half-finished melodies that by no means deserved completion&quot;, but after two days of sessions &quot;the results remain best to be unheard, even by Rolling Stones&#x27; completists&quot;. In 1995, Mick Jagger told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine that Jones had been jealous of the Jagger/Richards songwriting team, and added: &quot;To be honest, Brian had no talent for writing songs. None. I&#x27;ve never known a guy with less talent for songwriting.&quot;

Faithfull reported that Jones wrote an early version of the melody for &quot;Ruby Tuesday&quot; and presented it to the group. Victor Bockris reported that Richards and Jones worked out the final melody in the studio. Additionally, Jones is credited (along with Richards) for the instrumental piece &quot;Hear It&quot;. However, in 1966, Jones composed, produced, and played on the soundtrack to &quot;Mord und Totschlag&quot; (English title: &quot;A Degree Of Murder&quot;), an avant-garde German film with Anita Pallenberg, adding the majority of the instrumentation to the soundtrack.

The only known released Jones song is &quot;(Thank You) For Being There&quot;, which is a poem by Jones put to music by Carla Olson (who coincidentally has collaborated with Mick Taylor). It appeared on the 1990 album &quot;True Voices&quot; as performed by Krysia Kristianne and Robin Williamson.

==Other contributions==

In the summer of 1968, Jones recorded the Morocco-based ensemble, the Master Musicians of Joujouka (Jajouka), which was later used by the band; the recording was released in 1971 as &quot;Brian Jones Presents the Pipes of Pan at Joujouka&quot;. &quot;Brian Jones Presents the Pipes of Pan at Jajouka&quot; was rereleased in co-operation with Bachir Attar and Philip Glass in 1995.

In 1967, Jones played alto saxophone on the Beatles song &quot;You Know My Name (Look Up the Number)&quot;, which was released in March 1970, eight months after his death.

Jones also played percussion on the Jimi Hendrix song &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot;.

===Equipment===
Jones&#x27;s main guitar in the early years was a Harmony Stratotone, which he replaced with a Gretsch Double Anniversary in two-tone green. His later guitars were mainly new guitars that Gibson would provide: various Gibson Firebird models, a Gibson ES-330 and a Gibson Les Paul.

==Public image and legacy==

Jones&#x27;s musicianship, especially in the early days of the Rolling Stones, added much to the singles that propelled the band into the pop charts; it was his fashion sense and his hairstyle, which appealed to both men and women, that were copied by bands on both sides of the Atlantic.

Pallenberg has stated in an interview that Jones wanted to look like Françoise Hardy, loved &quot;dressing up and posing about&quot; and that he would ask her to do his hair and make-up. Bo Diddley described Jones as &quot;a little dude that was trying to pull the group ahead. I saw him as the leader. He didn&#x27;t take no mess. He was a fantastic cat; he handled the group beautifully.&quot;

Jones&#x27;s death at 27 was the first of the 1960s rock phenomenon of music artists dying at 27. His death was followed within two years by the drug-related deaths of Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison, Alan Wilson, and Janis Joplin, all of the same age. The coincidence of their deaths at the same age has been referred to in popular culture as the &quot;27 Club&quot;.

When Alastair Johns, who owned Cotchford Farm for over 40 years after Jones&#x27;s death, refurbished the pool, he sold the original tiles to Jones&#x27;s fans for £100 each. The sales of the tiles paid for half of the work.

The Psychic TV song &quot;Godstar&quot; is about Jones&#x27;s death, as are Robyn Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Trash&quot;, the Drovers&#x27; &quot;She&#x27;s as Pretty as Brian Jones Was&quot;, Jeff Dahl&#x27;s &quot;Mick and Keith killed Brian&quot;, Ted Nugent&#x27;s &quot;Death by Misadventure&quot;, and Salmonblaster&#x27;s &quot;Brian Jones&quot;. Toy Love&#x27;s song &quot;Swimming Pool&quot; lists several dead rock icons, including Jones (the others are Morrison, Hendrix, and Marc Bolan), just as A House&#x27;s &quot;Endless Art&quot; does; Jones is also mentioned in De Phazz&#x27;s song &quot;Something Special&quot;. The Master Musicians of Joujouka song &quot;Brian Jones Joujouka Very Stoned&quot; was released in 1974 and 1996. The band Tigers Jaw heavily references Jones and his death in their song &quot;I Saw Water&quot;, and pop punk band Groovie Ghoulies released the song &quot;Planet Brian Jones&quot; on a 7&quot; vinyl EP of the same name in 1997. Alvin Youngblood Hart&#x27;s song &quot;Watchin&#x27; Brian Jones&quot; appeared on his 2014 single release &quot;Helluva Way (For A Man To Make a Livin&#x27;)&quot;. English group Ultimate Painting recorded &quot;Song For Brian Jones&quot; for their 2016 album &quot;Dusk&quot;.
As of 2023, fans from around the world continue to visit and decorate Jones&#x27;s grave in Cheltenham.

Many of Jones&#x27;s contemporaries admit to idolising him as young musicians, including Noel Redding, who, according to Pamela Des Barres&#x27;s book &quot;I&#x27;m With the Band&quot;, contemplated suicide after hearing about his death. The Brian Jonestown Massacre, an American psychedelic rock band, takes its name partly from Jones and is heavily influenced by his work.

The 2005 film &quot;Stoned&quot; is a fictionalised account of Jones&#x27;s death and his role in the Rolling Stones, partly based on Geoffrey Giuliano&#x27;s book &quot;Paint It Black: The Murder of Brian Jones&quot; (1994). The part of Brian was played by English actor Leo Gregory.

A fictionalised version of Jones and the tribute concert to him appears in Alan Moore and Kevin O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume III: Century&quot; in its second issue, &quot;Paint it Black&quot;. The world of &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; is an alternate universe version of Earth where several works of fiction are real with the fictional characters frequently interacting with each other, with these characters occasionally serving as analogues of historical figures. Jones&#x27;s fictional stand-in is Basil Fotherington-Tomas from the &quot;Nigel Molesworth&quot; books (who is now an adult, having grown up since the events in those books, and changed his name to &quot;Basil Thomas&quot;) and his band is called &quot;The Purple Orchestra&quot;.

Jones&#x27;s musicianship and contribution to the band are featured heavily in the documentary &quot;Crossfire Hurricane&quot;. Another documentary, &quot;Rolling Stone: Life and Death of Brian Jones&quot;, directed by Danny Garcia and distributed by Dudeski and Chip Baker Films, was released in 2020.

<doc id="81460" wikidata="Q617457" url="?curid=81460" title="List of monarchs of Brazil">
<text>The monarchs of Brazil (Portuguese: &quot;monarcas do Brasil&quot;) were the imperial heads of state and hereditary rulers of Brazil from the House of Braganza that reigned from the creation of the Brazilian monarchy in 1815 as a constituent kingdom of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves until the republican coup d&#x27;état that overthrew the Empire of Brazil in 1889.

The coast of the territory which would become known as Brazil was first explored by Portuguese navigators on 22 April 1500. This territory was subsequently colonized by the Portuguese crown. Since the transfer of the Portuguese court to Brazil in 1808, colonial rule had de facto ended. On 16 December 1815, Prince Regent John, the future king John VI, raised Brazil to the status of a kingdom, thus making his mother, Maria I, the reigning queen, the first monarch of Brazil. The next year, 20 March 1816, John succeeded his mother as king of the united Luso-Brazilian monarchy. Having proclaimed independence of the Kingdom of Brazil from Portugal in 1822, Pedro I, son of John VI, was acclaimed the first emperor of Brazil on 12 October 1822. He was later succeeded on 7 April 1831 by his son Pedro II, deposed along with the 74-years-old monarchy on 15 November 1889 in a bloodless and unpopular military coup d&#x27;état.

==Title==
From 16 December 1815 to 7 September 1822, while the Kingdom of Brazil was in union with the Kingdom of Portugal, the monarch&#x27;s full title and styles were, according to tradition and the United Kingdom&#x27;s 1822 Constitution: &quot;By the Grace of God, King/Queen of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves, of either side of the sea in Africa, Lord of Guinea and of Conquest, Navigation and Commerce of Ethiopia, Arabia, Persia and India, etc.&quot;

From 12 October 1822 to 15 November 1889, as the independent Empire of Brazil, the country&#x27;s monarch&#x27;s full title were: &quot;By Grace of God and Unanimous Acclamation of the People, Constitutional Emperor/Empress and Perpetual Defender of Brazil&quot;.

It&#x27;s worth noting that from a short period of time, between 15 November 1825 and 10 March 1826, according to the Treaty of Rio de Janeiro, by which Portugal recognized Brazilian independence, it was granted to King John VI the courtesy title of Emperor of Brazil, while his son was the actual reigning emperor. From the treaty&#x27;s date to his death John VI used the title: &quot;By the Grace of God, John VI, Emperor of Brazil, King of Portugal and the Algarves, of either side of the sea in Africa, Lord of Guinea and of Conquest, Navigation and Commerce of Ethiopia, Arabia, Persia and India, etc.&quot;

==Kingdom of Brazil (1815–1822)==

The house of Braganza continued to rule over Brazil, and on 16 December 1815, the Prince Regent João, the future king João VI raised Brazil to the status of a kingdom, thus making his mother, Maria I, the reigning Queen, the first Monarch of Brazil. The next year, 20 March 1816, João succeeded his mother as King of the united Luso-Brazilian monarchy.

==Empire of Brazil (1822–1889)==

The house of Braganza continued to rule over Brazil after Pedro I, son of John VI, was acclaimed the first Emperor of Brazil on 12 October 1822, having proclaimed the independence of the Kingdom of Brazil from Portugal. He was later succeeded on 7 April 1831 by his son Pedro II, the last monarch of Brazil. Pedro II of Brazil, reigned 49 years in fact or 58 years if the regency period is considered.

<doc id="81462" wikidata="Q9284972" url="?curid=81462" title="Jumping jack">
<text>A jumping jack, also known as a star jump and called a side-straddle hop in the US military, is a physical jumping exercise performed by jumping to a position with the legs spread wide and the hands going overhead, sometimes in a clap, and then returning to a position with the feet together and the arms at the sides.

The name origin for the jumping jack exercise has sometimes erroneously been identified as World War I U.S. General John J. &quot;Black Jack&quot; Pershing, who is said to have developed the exercise, but in fact the name comes from the jumping jack children&#x27;s toy, which makes similar arm swing and leg splay motions when the strings are tugged.

Although he played no part in inventing the exercise, the late fitness expert Jack LaLanne was given credit for popularizing it in the United States. LaLanne used the jumping exercise during routines he promoted in decades of television fitness programming.

==Variations and progression==
The exercise can be made more or less intense with different variations. In general, squatting deeper will make jumps more difficult, although not resulting in greater height than squats at &lt;90. According to studies, greater height is achieved when performing the jump from a shallower squat position (star jumps are often performed from a quarter squat position), while deeper squats are more effective at improving vertical jump height.

===Low impact===

The legs are stepped to the side without jumping, with the knees slightly bent and keeping in line with the ankles.

In an intermediate variation, the legs hop out to shoulder width while raising the arms, then hop back together while lowering the arms.

===Power jacks===
Power jacks are like jumping jacks but land in a wide squat position. As with other jumps, jumping out of a deeper squat position increases the intensity of the exercise and this can result in injury if proper form is not maintained in the deep squat position between successive jumps. Power jacks can be performed over multiple counts to pull the legs back to center with two small incremental jumps to return to the starting position,

===Squat jacks===

Squat jacks are performed by jumping the legs out and in while staying in a half squat position.

===Star jumps===
Star jumps are more explosive and performed with greater height than regular jumping jacks. Instead of landing in a wide stance the legs are swung out laterally in the air and pulled back to center to land in a tucked narrow squat. They are a rebounding jump beginning and landing in the tucked narrow squat position to continue successive jumps.

===Half jacks===
A similar jump exercise is called half-jacks, which were created to prevent rotator cuff injuries, which have been linked to the repetitive movements of the exercise. They are like regular jumping jacks but the arms go halfway above the head instead of all the way above it. The arms also hit the sides to help tighten the jump.

===Split jacks===

The split jack is a variation on the jumping jack that is similar to the split jump. It is performed by first standing in a staggered stance, while having the right foot in front of the left foot. Then the actual jumps are done while swinging an arm that is opposite to the jumping foot, switching legs throughout the process.

==Records==
The most jumping jacks performed in one minute is 136 - achieved by Binod Thapa in Kathmandu, Nepal, on 28 July 2023.

In 2010, &quot;National Geographic Kids&quot; organized an event in 1,050 locations as a part of Michelle Obama&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Move!&quot; exercise campaign in which 300,365 people were measured doing jumping jacks (for one minute) in a 24-hour period.

<text>Fort Sumter is an historic sea fort in the southeastern United States, near Charleston, South Carolina. Built on an artificial island at the entrance of Charleston Harbor to defend the region from a naval invasion, it was constructed after British forces captured and occupied Washington during the War of 1812 via a naval attack. The fort was still incomplete in 1861 when the Battle of Fort Sumter occurred from April 12 to 13, sparking the Civil War; it was severely damaged during the battle and left in ruins.

Although there were some efforts at reconstruction after the war, the fort as conceived was never completed. Since the middle of the 20th century, Fort Sumter has been open to the public as part of the Fort Sumter and Fort Moultrie National Historical Park, operated by the National Park Service.

==History==
===The building of Fort Sumter===
Named after American military officer Thomas Sumter, Fort Sumter was built after British forces captured and occupied Washington during the War of 1812 via a naval attack. It was built near Charleston, South Carolina, as one of the third system of U.S. fortifications to protect American harbors from a naval invasion. Constructed on an artificial island in the middle of the channel that provides Charleston with natural shelter, Fort Sumter was intended to dominate the harbor, reinforcing the protection provided by the shore artillery batteries at Fort Moultrie, Fort Wagner, and Fort Gregg.

The artificial island was originally a sand bar. In 1827, a group of engineers carried out depth sounding and concluded that it was a suitable location for a fort. Construction began in 1829. Seventy thousand tons of granite were transported from New England to build up the artificial island. By 1834, a timber foundation that was several feet beneath the water had been laid. However, the decision was made to build a (stronger) brick fort.

The brick fort is five-sided, long, with walls thick, standing over the low tide mark. Although never completed, it was designed to house 650 men and 135 guns in three tiers of gun emplacements.

Construction dragged out because of title problems, then problems with funding such a large and technically challenging project. Unpleasant weather and disease made the situation worse. The exterior was eventually finished, but the interior and armaments were never completed.
===Ownership===
Early in the nineteenth century, South Carolina had owned multiple forts, namely Fort Moultrie, Castle Pinckney, and Fort Johnson, but ceded them, along with sites for the future erection of forts, to the United States in 1805. The forts were of questionable military value and costly to maintain, so when asked to cede them, the state complied. This was not the last time that South Carolina would cede forts to the United States; on December 17, 1836, South Carolina officially ceded all &quot;right, title and, claim&quot; to the site of Fort Sumter to the United States.

===Civil War===
====Summary====
Fort Sumter is notable for two battles, the first of which began the American Civil War. It was one of a number of special forts planned after the War of 1812, combining high walls and heavy masonry, and classified as Third System, as a grade of structural integrity. Work started in 1829, but was incomplete by 1861, when the Civil War began.

The attack on Fort Sumter is generally taken as the beginning of the American Civil War—the first shots fired. Certainly it was so taken at the time—citizens of Charleston were celebrating. The First Battle of Fort Sumter began on April 12, 1861, when South Carolina Militia artillery fired from shore on the Union garrison. These were (both sides agreed) the first shots of the war. The bombardment continued all day, watched by many happy civilians. The fort had been cut off from its supply line and surrendered the next day. Major Robert Anderson took the flag with him as they evacuated.

The Second Battle of Fort Sumter (September 8, 1863) was a failed attempt by the Union to retake the fort, dogged by a rivalry between army and navy commanders. Although the fort was reduced to rubble, it remained in Confederate hands until it was evacuated as General Sherman marched through South Carolina in February 1865.

A widely announced &quot;End of the War&quot; celebration took place at Fort Sumter on April 14, 1865. The now-Major General Anderson, though ill and retired, came to the ceremony and raised the flag. The assassination of President Lincoln, which occurred on the evening of that date, almost immediately overshadowed the festivities.

====Preparing for war====
On December 26, 1860, only six days after South Carolina seceded from the Union, U.S. Army Major Robert Anderson abandoned the indefensible Fort Moultrie, spiking its large guns, burning its gun carriages, and taking its smaller cannon with him. He secretly relocated companies E and H (127 men, 13 of them musicians) of the 1st U.S. Artillery to Fort Sumter on his own initiative, without orders from his superiors. He thought that providing a stronger defense would delay an attack by South Carolina militia. The fort was not yet complete at the time and fewer than half of the cannons that should have been available were in place, due to military downsizing by President James Buchanan.

In a letter delivered January 31, 1861, South Carolina Governor Pickens demanded of President Buchanan that he surrender Fort Sumter because &quot;I regard that possession is not consistent with the dignity or safety of the State of South Carolina.&quot; Over the next few months repeated calls for evacuation of Fort Sumter from the government of South Carolina and then from Confederate Brigadier General P. G. T. Beauregard were ignored. Union attempts to resupply and reinforce the garrison were repulsed on January 9, 1861, when shots fired by cadets from the Citadel prevented the steamer &quot;Star of the West&quot;, hired to transport troops and supplies to Fort Sumter, from completing the task.

After realizing that Anderson&#x27;s command would run out of food by April 15, 1861, President Lincoln ordered a fleet of ships, under the command of Gustavus V. Fox, to attempt entry into Charleston Harbor and supply Fort Sumter. The ships assigned were the steam sloops-of-war USS &quot;Pawnee&quot; and USS &quot;Powhatan&quot;, transporting motorized launches and about 300 sailors (secretly removed from the Charleston fleet to join in the forced reinforcement of Fort Pickens, Pensacola, FL), armed screw steamer USS &quot;Pocahontas&quot;, Revenue Cutter USRC &quot;Harriet Lane&quot;, steamer &quot;Baltic&quot; transporting about 200 troops, composed of companies C and D of the 2nd U.S. Artillery, and three hired tugboats with added protection against small arms fire to be used to tow troop and supply barges directly to Fort Sumter. By April 6, 1861, the first ships began to set sail for their rendezvous off the Charleston Bar. The first to arrive was &quot;Harriet Lane&quot;, on the evening of April 11, 1861.

====First Battle of Fort Sumter====
On Thursday, April 11, 1861, Beauregard sent three aides, Colonel James Chesnut, Jr., Captain Stephen D. Lee, and Lieutenant A. R. Chisolm to demand the surrender of the fort. Anderson declined, and the aides returned to report to Beauregard. After Beauregard had consulted the Confederate Secretary of War, Leroy Walker, he sent the aides back to the fort and authorized Chesnut to decide whether the fort should be taken by force. The aides waited for hours while Anderson considered his alternatives and played for time. At about 3:00 a.m., when Anderson finally announced his conditions, Colonel Chesnut, after conferring with the other aides, decided that they were &quot;manifestly futile and not within the scope of the instructions verbally given to us.&quot; The aides then left the fort and proceeded to the nearby Fort Johnson. There, Chesnut ordered the fort to open fire on Fort Sumter.

On Friday, April 12, 1861, at 4:30 a.m., Confederate batteries opened fire on the fort, firing for 34 straight hours. Edmund Ruffin, noted Virginian agronomist and secessionist, claimed that he fired the first shot on Fort Sumter. His story has been widely believed, but Lieutenant Henry S. Farley, commanding a battery of two 10-inch siege mortars on James Island, actually fired the first shot at 4:30 a.m. No attempt was made to return the fire for more than two hours. The fort&#x27;s supply of ammunition was not suited for the task; also, there were no fuses for their explosive shells, which means that they could not explode. Only solid iron balls could be used against the Confederate batteries. At about 7:00 a.m., Captain Abner Doubleday, the fort&#x27;s second in command, was given the honor of firing the Union&#x27;s first shot, in defense of the fort. He missed, in part because Major Anderson did not use the guns mounted on the highest tier—the barbette tier, where the guns could engage the Confederate batteries better, but where the gunners would be more exposed to Confederate fire. The firing continued all day. The Union fired slowly to conserve ammunition. At night, the fire from the fort stopped, but the Confederates still lobbed an occasional shell into Sumter. On Saturday, April 13, the fort was surrendered and evacuated. During the attack, the Union colors fell. Lt. Norman J. Hall risked life and limb to put them back up, burning off his eyebrows permanently. A Confederate soldier bled to death having been wounded by a misfiring cannon. One Union soldier died and another was mortally wounded during the 47th shot of a 100-shot salute, allowed by the Confederacy. Afterward, the salute was shortened to 50 shots. Accounts, such as in the famous diary of Mary Chesnut, describe Charleston residents along what is now known as The Battery, sitting on balconies and drinking salutes to the start of the hostilities.

The Fort Sumter Flag became a popular patriotic symbol after Major Anderson returned North with it. The &quot;Star of the West&quot; took all the garrison members to New York City. There they were welcomed and honored with a parade on Broadway.

====Union siege of Fort Sumter====

Union efforts to retake Charleston Harbor began on April 7, 1863, when Rear Admiral Samuel Francis Du Pont, commander of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, led the ironclad frigate &quot;New Ironsides&quot;, the tower ironclad &quot;Keokuk&quot;, and the monitors &quot;Weehawken&quot;, &quot;Passaic&quot;, &quot;Montauk&quot;, &quot;Patapsco&quot;, &quot;Nantucket&quot;, &quot;Catskill&quot;, and &quot;Nahant&quot; in an attack on the harbor&#x27;s defenses. (The 1863 Battle of Fort Sumter was the largest deployment of monitors in action up to that time.) The attack was unsuccessful: the Union&#x27;s best ship, USS &quot;New Ironsides&quot; never effectively engaged, and the ironclads fired only 154 rounds, while receiving 2,209 from the Confederate defenders . Due to damage received in the attack, the USS &quot;Keokuk&quot; sank the next day, off the southern tip of Morris Island. Over the next month, working at night to avoid the attention of the Federal squadron, the Confederates salvaged &quot;Keokuk&#x27;s&quot; two eleven-inch Dahlgren guns . One of the Dahlgren guns was promptly placed in Fort Sumter.

The Confederates, in the meantime, were strengthening Fort Sumter. A workforce of just under 500 enslaved Africans, under the supervision of Confederate army engineers, were filling casemates with sand, protecting the gorge wall with sandbags, and building new traverse, blindages, and bombproofs. Some of Fort Sumter&#x27;s artillery had been removed, but 40 pieces still were mounted. Fort Sumter&#x27;s heaviest guns were mounted on the barbette, the fort&#x27;s highest level, where they had wide angles of fire and could fire down on approaching ships. The barbette was also more exposed to enemy gunfire than the casemates in the two lower levels of the fort.

A special military decoration, known as the Gillmore Medal, was later issued to all Union service members who had performed duty at Fort Sumter under the command of Major-General Quincy Adams Gillmore.



After the devastating bombardment, both Major General Quincy A. Gillmore and Rear Admiral John A. Dahlgren, now commanding the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, determined to launch a boat assault on Fort Sumter for the night of September 8–9, 1863. Cooperation between the Army and Navy was poor. Dahlgren refused to place his sailors and Marines under the command of an army officer, so two flotillas set out towards Fort Sumter that night. The army flotilla was detained off Morris Island by the low tide. By the time they could proceed, the navy assault had already been defeated and the army flotilla returned to shore.

The Navy&#x27;s assault involved 400 sailors and Marines in 25 boats. The operation was a fiasco from beginning to end. Poor reconnaissance, planning, and communication all characterized the operation. Commander Thomas H. Stevens, Jr., commanding the monitor &quot;Patapsco&quot;, was placed in charge of the assault. When Commander Stevens protested that he &quot;knew nothing of [the assault&#x27;s] organization &quot; and &quot;made some remonstrances on this grounds and others.&quot; Dahlgren replied, &quot;There is nothing but a corporal&#x27;s guard [about 6–10 men] in the fort, and all we have to do is go and take possession.&quot; . This underestimation of the Confederate forces on Dahlgren&#x27;s part may explain why he was hostile to a joint operation wishing to reserve the credit for the victory to the navy. Less than half of the boats landed. Most of the boats that did land landed on the right flank or right gorge angle, rather than on the gorge where there was a passable breach. The Union sailors and Marines who did land could not scale the wall. The Confederates fired upon the landing party and as well as throwing hand grenades and loose bricks. The men in the boats that had not landed fired muskets and revolvers blindly at the fort, endangering the landing party more than the garrison. The landing party took shelter in shell holes in the wall of the fort. In response to a signal rocket fired by the garrison, Fort Johnson and the Confederate warship CSS &quot;Chicora&quot; opened fire upon the boats and landing party. A number of the boats withdrew under fire and the landing party surrendered. The Union casualties were 8 killed, 19 wounded, and 105 captured (including 15 of the wounded). The Confederates did not suffer any casualties in the assault.

After the unsuccessful boat assault, the bombardment recommenced and proceeded with the varying degree of intensity, doing more damage to Fort Sumter until the end of the war. The garrison continued to suffer casualties. The Confederates continued to salvage guns and other material from the ruins and harassed the Union batteries on Morris Island with sharpshooters. The Confederates mounted four columbiads, one columbiad rifled, and two rifled 42-pounders, in the left face, bottom tier casemates.

====Recovery of Fort Sumter====

The last Confederate commander, Major Thomas A. Huguenin, a graduate of The Citadel, never surrendered Fort Sumter, but General William Tecumseh Sherman&#x27;s advance through South Carolina finally forced the Confederates to evacuate Charleston on February 17, 1865, and abandon Fort Sumter. The Federal government formally took possession of Fort Sumter on February 22, 1865.

Anderson, now a major general, returned to Sumter with the flag he had been forced to lower four years earlier, and on April 14, 1865, raised it in triumph over the ruined fort. Henry Ward Beecher was present and subsequently spoke at length about the occasion.

===After the war===

When the Civil War ended, Fort Sumter was in ruins. The U.S. Army worked to restore it as a useful military installation. The damaged walls were re-leveled to a lower height and partially rebuilt. The third tier of gun emplacements was removed. Eleven of the original first-tier gun rooms were restored with 100-pounder Parrott rifles.

From 1876 to 1897, Fort Sumter was used only as an unmanned lighthouse station. The start of the Spanish–American War prompted renewed interest in its military use and reconstruction commenced on the facilities that had further deteriorated over time. A new massive concrete blockhouse-style installation was built in 1898 inside the original walls, armed with two 12-inch M1888 guns, one on a disappearing carriage. Named &quot;Battery Huger&quot; in honor of Revolutionary War General Isaac Huger, it never saw combat. This battery was deactivated in 1947, and in 1948 the fort became Fort Sumter National Monument under the control of the National Park Service.

One hundred and forty-seven years after it was sent, a rolled up telegraphic message was found in a trunk belonging to Col. Alexander Ramsay Thompson of New York and eventually given to a museum in Charleston, S.C. The telegram was dated April 14, 1861 from the Governor of South Carolina to Gazaway Bugg Lamar in New York, reading in part:

In 1966, the site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Civil War Trust (a division of the American Battlefield Trust) and its partners have acquired and preserved of historic land related to the battles at Fort Sumter.

== Fort Sumter and Fort Moultrie National Historical Park ==
Fort Sumter and Fort Moultrie National Historical Park encompasses three sites in Charleston: the original Fort Sumter, the Fort Sumter Visitor Education Center, and Fort Moultrie on Sullivan&#x27;s Island. Access to Fort Sumter itself is by a 30-minute ferry ride from the Fort Sumter Visitor Education Center or Patriots Point. Access by private boat is no longer allowed.

The Visitor Education Center&#x27;s museum features exhibits about the disagreements between the North and South that led to the incidents at Fort Sumter. The museum at Fort Sumter focuses on the activities at the fort, including its construction and role during the Civil War.

April 12, 2011, marked the 150th Anniversary of the start of the Civil War. There was a commemoration of the events by thousands of Civil War reenactors with encampments in the area. A United States stamp of Fort Sumter and a first-day cover were issued that day.

On June 28, 2015, in the aftermath of the events of June 17, 2015, when a mass shooting took place at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in downtown Charleston, South Carolina, the five small flags that were arranged in a semi-circle around the large flagpole flying the 50-star United States flag at Fort Sumter were lowered so that the South Carolina flag could be flown at half staff. Those flown include a 33-star United States flag, a Confederate First National Flag (Stars and Bars), a South Carolina State Flag, a Confederate Second National Flag (Stainless Banner), and a 35-star United States flag. This display was added to Fort Sumter National Monument in the 1970s. In August 2015, the flagpoles were removed to create a new exhibit. The four historic national flags now fly on the lower parade ground.

By December 2019, sea level rise led to a Park Service decision to move some of the large rocks &quot;originally installed to protect the fort from the sea,&quot; farther from the fort&#x27;s walls, in order to create a protective breakwater and wetland.

<text>Paul Hindemith ( ; ; 16 November 189528 December 1963) was a German and American composer, music theorist, teacher, violist and conductor. He founded the Amar Quartet in 1921, touring extensively in Europe. As a composer, he became a major advocate of the &quot;Neue Sachlichkeit&quot; (New Objectivity) style of music in the 1920s, with compositions such as &quot;Kammermusik&quot;, including works with viola and viola d&#x27;amore as solo instruments in a neo-Bachian spirit. Other notable compositions include his song cycle &quot;Das Marienleben&quot; (1923), Das Unaufhörliche (1931), &quot;Der Schwanendreher&quot; for viola and orchestra (1935), the opera &quot;Mathis der Maler&quot; (1938), the &quot;Symphonic Metamorphosis of Themes by Carl Maria von Weber&quot; (1943), and the oratorio &quot;When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom&#x27;d&quot; (1946), a requiem based on Walt Whitman&#x27;s poem. Hindemith and his wife emigrated to Switzerland and the United States ahead of World War II, after worsening difficulties with the Nazi German regime. In his later years, he conducted and recorded much of his own music.

Most of Hindemith&#x27;s compositions are anchored by a foundational tone, and use musical forms and counterpoint and cadences typical of the Baroque and Classical traditions. His harmonic language is more modern, freely using all 12 notes of the chromatic scale within his tonal framework, as detailed in his three-volume treatise, &quot;The Craft of Musical Composition&quot;.

==Life and career==
Paul Hindemith was born in Hanau, near Frankfurt, the eldest child of the painter and decorator Robert Hindemith from Lower Silesia and his wife Marie Hindemith, née Warnecke. He was taught the violin as a child. He entered Frankfurt&#x27;s Dr. Hoch&#x27;s Konservatorium, where he studied violin with Adolf Rebner, as well as conducting and composition with Arnold Mendelssohn and Bernhard Sekles. At first he supported himself by playing in dance bands and musical-comedy groups. He became deputy leader of the Frankfurt Opera Orchestra in 1914 and was promoted to concertmaster in 1916. He played second violin in the Rebner String Quartet from 1914.

After his father&#x27;s 1915 death in World War I, Hindemith was conscripted into the Imperial German Army in September 1917 and sent to a regiment in Alsace in January 1918. There he was assigned to play bass drum in the regiment band, and also formed a string quartet. In May 1918 he was deployed to the front in Flanders, where he served as a sentry; his diary has him &quot;surviving grenade attacks only by good luck&quot;, according to &quot;New Grove Dictionary&quot;. After the armistice he returned to Frankfurt and the Rebner Quartet.

In 1921, Hindemith founded the Amar Quartet, playing viola, and extensively toured Europe with an emphasis on contemporary music. His younger brother Rudolf was the original cellist.
As a composer, he became a major advocate of the &quot;Neue Sachlichkeit&quot; (New Objectivity) style of music in the 1920s, with compositions such as &quot;Kammermusik&quot;. Reminiscent of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Brandenburg Concertos&quot;, they include works with viola and viola d&#x27;amore as solo instruments in a neo-Bachian spirit. In 1922, some of his pieces were played in the International Society for Contemporary Music festival at Salzburg, which first brought him to the attention of an international audience. The next year, he composed the song cycle &quot;Das Marienleben&quot; (&quot;The Life of Mary&quot;) and began to work as an organizer of the Donaueschingen Festival, where he programmed works by several avant-garde composers, including Anton Webern and Arnold Schoenberg. In 1927 he was appointed Professor at the Berliner Hochschule für Musik in Berlin. Hindemith wrote the music for Hans Richter&#x27;s 1928 avant-garde film &quot;Ghosts Before Breakfast&quot; (&quot;Vormittagsspuk&quot;) and also acted in the film; the score and original film were later burned by the Nazis. In 1929, Hindemith played the solo part in the premiere of William Walton&#x27;s viola concerto, after Lionel Tertis, for whom it was written, turned it down.

On 15 May 1924, Hindemith married the actress and singer Gertrud (Johanna Gertrude) Rottenberg (1900–1967). The marriage was childless.

The Nazis&#x27; relationship to Hindemith&#x27;s music was complicated. Some condemned his music as &quot;degenerate&quot; (largely based on his early, sexually charged operas such as &quot;Sancta Susanna&quot;). In December 1934, during a speech at the Berlin Sports Palace, Germany&#x27;s Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels publicly denounced Hindemith as an &quot;atonal noisemaker&quot;. The Nazis banned his music in October 1936, and he was subsequently included in the 1938 Entartete Musik (Degenerate Music) exhibition in Düsseldorf. Other officials working in Nazi Germany, though, thought that he might provide Germany with an example of a modern German composer, as, by this time, he was writing music based in tonality, with frequent references to folk music. The conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler&#x27;s defence of Hindemith, published in 1934, takes this line. The controversy around his work continued throughout the thirties, with Hindemith falling in and out of favour with the Nazis.

During the 1930s, Hindemith visited Cairo and also Ankara several times. He accepted an invitation from the Turkish government to oversee the creation of a music school in Ankara in 1935, after Goebbels had pressured him to request an indefinite leave of absence from the Berlin Academy. In Turkey, he was the leading figure of a new music pedagogy in the era of president Kemal Atatürk. His deputy was Eduard Zuckmayer. Hindemith led the reorganization of Turkish music education and the early efforts to establish the Turkish State Opera and Ballet. He did not stay in Turkey as long as many other émigrés, but he greatly influenced Turkish musical life; the Ankara State Conservatory owes much to his efforts. Young Turkish musicians regarded Hindemith as a &quot;real master&quot;, and he was appreciated and greatly respected.
Toward the end of the 1930s, Hindemith made several tours of America as a viola and viola d&#x27;amore soloist.

He emigrated to Switzerland in 1938, partly because his wife was of part-Jewish ancestry.

At the same time that he was codifying his musical language, Hindemith&#x27;s teaching and compositions began to be affected by his theories, according to critics such as Ernest Ansermet. Arriving in the U.S. in 1940, he taught primarily at Yale University, where he founded the Yale Collegium Musicum. At Yale, he required his students to study composition and theory from his pedagogical work, &quot;The Craft of Musical Composition&quot;, among other educational texts. Because of his commitments outside the university, the number of composers who studied under Hindemith was small. According to Luther Noss&#x27;s &quot;A History of the Yale School of Music 1855-1970&quot;, Hindemith taught for a little over ten years, teaching 400 students, of whom 46 earned degrees, mostly in music theory. He had such notable students as Lukas Foss, Graham George, Andrew Hill, Norman Dello Joio, Mel Powell, Yehudi Wyner, Harold Shapero, Hans Otte, Ruth Schönthal, Samuel Adler, Leonard Sarason, Fenno Heath, Mitch Leigh, and George Roy Hill. Hindemith also taught at the University at Buffalo, Cornell University, and Wells College. During this time he gave the Charles Eliot Norton Lectures at Harvard, from which the book &quot;A Composer&#x27;s World&quot; (1952) was extracted. Hindemith had a long friendship with Erich Katz, whose compositions were influenced by him. Also among Hindemith&#x27;s students were the future rocket scientist Wernher von Braun and the composers Franz Reizenstein, Harald Genzmer, Oskar Sala, Arnold Cooke, Robert Strassburg, and dozens of other notables.
Hindemith became a U.S. citizen in 1946, but returned to Europe in 1953, living in Zürich and teaching at the university there until he retired from teaching in 1957. Toward the end of his life he began to conduct more and made numerous recordings, mostly of his own music.

In 1954, an anonymous critic for &quot;Opera&quot; magazine, having attended a performance of Hindemith&#x27;s &quot;Neues vom Tage&quot;, wrote: &quot;Mr Hindemith is no virtuoso conductor, but he does possess an extraordinary knack of making performers understand how his own music is supposed to go.&quot;

Hindemith received the Wihuri Sibelius Prize in 1955. He was awarded the Balzan Prize in 1962 &quot;for the wealth, extent and variety of his work, which is among the most valid in contemporary music, and which contains masterpieces of opera, symphonic and chamber music.&quot;

Despite a prolonged decline in his physical health, Hindemith composed almost until his death. He died in Frankfurt from pancreatitis, aged 68. He and his wife are buried in Cimetière La Chiésaz, La Chiésaz, Canton of Vaud, Switzerland.

==Music==
Hindemith is among the most significant German composers of his time. His early works are in a late romantic idiom, and he later produced expressionist works, rather in the style of the early Schoenberg, before developing a leaner, contrapuntally complex style in the 1920s. This style has been described as neoclassical, but is quite different from the works by Igor Stravinsky labeled with that term, owing more to the contrapuntal language of Johann Sebastian Bach and Max Reger than the Classical clarity of Mozart.

The new style can be heard in the series of works called &quot;Kammermusik&quot; (Chamber Music) from 1922 to 1927. Each of these pieces is written for a different small instrumental ensemble, many of them very unusual. &quot;Kammermusik No. 6&quot;, for example, is a concerto for the viola d&#x27;amore, an instrument that has not been in wide use since the baroque period, but which Hindemith himself played. He continued to write for unusual groups of instruments throughout his life, producing (for example) a trio for viola, heckelphone and piano (1928), seven trios for three trautoniums (1930), a sonata for double bass, and a concerto for trumpet, bassoon, and strings (both in 1949).

In the 1930s Hindemith began to write less for chamber music groups, and more for large orchestral forces. He wrote his opera &quot;Mathis der Maler&quot;, based on the life of the painter Matthias Grünewald, in 1933–1935. This opera is rarely staged, though a well-known production by the New York City Opera in 1995 was an exception. It combines the neo-classicism of earlier works with folk song. As a preliminary stage to the composing of this opera, Hindemith wrote a purely instrumental symphony also called &quot;Mathis der Maler&quot;, which is one of his most frequently performed works. In the opera, some portions of the symphony appear as instrumental interludes; others were elaborated in vocal scenes.

Hindemith wrote &quot;Gebrauchsmusik&quot; (Music for Use)—compositions intended to have a social or political purpose and sometimes written to be played by amateurs. The concept was inspired by Bertolt Brecht. An example of this is Hindemith&#x27;s &quot;Trauermusik&quot; (Funeral Music), written in January 1936. He was preparing the London premiere of his viola concerto &quot;Der Schwanendreher&quot; when he heard news of the death of George V. He quickly wrote &quot;Trauermusik&quot; for solo viola and string orchestra in tribute to the late king, and the premiere was given that same evening, the day after the king&#x27;s death. Other examples of Hindemith&#x27;s &quot;Gebrauchsmusik&quot; include: 
* the &quot;Plöner Musiktage&quot; (1932), a series of pieces written for a day of community music-making in the city of Plön, culminating in an evening concert by grammar-school students and teachers.
* a Scherzo for viola and cello (1934), written in several hours during a series of recording sessions as a &quot;filler&quot; for an unexpected blank side of a 78 rpm album, and recorded immediately upon its completion.
* &quot;Wir bauen eine Stadt&quot; (&quot;We&#x27;re Building a City&quot;), an opera for eight-year-olds (1930).

Hindemith&#x27;s most popular work, both on record and in the concert hall, is probably the &quot;Symphonic Metamorphosis of Themes by Carl Maria von Weber&quot;, written in 1943. It takes melodies from various works by Carl Maria von Weber, mainly piano duets, but also one from the overture to his incidental music for &quot;Turandot&quot; (Op. 37/J. 75), and transforms and adapts them so that each movement of the piece is based on one theme.

In 1951, Hindemith completed his &quot;Symphony in B-flat&quot;. Scored for concert band, it was written for the U.S. Army Band &quot;Pershing&#x27;s Own&quot;. Hindemith premiered it with that band on 5 April of that year. Its second performance took place under the baton of Hugh McMillan, conducting the Boulder Symphonic Band at the University of Colorado. The piece is representative of Hindemith&#x27;s late works, exhibiting strong contrapuntal lines throughout, and is a cornerstone of the band repertoire. He recorded it in stereo with members of the Philharmonia Orchestra for EMI in 1956.

===Musical system===

Most of Hindemith&#x27;s music employs a unique system that is tonal but non-diatonic, often notated without a traditional key signature. Like most tonal music, it is centred on a tonic and modulates from one tonal centre to another, but it &quot;attempts ... the free use of all the twelve tones of the chromatic scale&quot;, rather than relying on a diatonic scale as a restricted subset of these notes. He even rewrote some of his music after developing this system. One of the core features of Hindemith&#x27;s system is a ranking of all musical intervals of the 12-tone equally tempered scale, from the most consonant to the most dissonant. He classifies chords in six categories, on the basis of dissonance, whether they contain a tritone, and whether they clearly suggest a root or tonal centre. His philosophy also encompassed melody—he strove for melodies that do not clearly outline major or minor triads.

In the late 1930s Hindemith wrote an instructional treatise in three volumes, &quot;The Craft of Musical Composition&quot;, which lays out this system in great detail. He also advocated this system as a means of understanding and analyzing the harmonic structure of other music, claiming that it has a broader reach than the traditional Roman numeral approach to chords (an approach strongly tied to diatonic scales). In the final chapter of Book 1, Hindemith seeks to illustrate the wide-ranging relevance and applicability of his system, analyzing musical examples from the medieval to the contemporary. These analyses include the early Gregorian melody &quot;Dies irae&quot;, compositions by Guillaume de Machaut, J. S. Bach, Richard Wagner, Igor Stravinsky, Arnold Schoenberg, and a composition of his own.

Hindemith&#x27;s 1942 piano work &quot;Ludus Tonalis&quot; contains twelve fugues, in the manner of Johann Sebastian Bach, using traditional devices like inversion, diminution, augmentation, retrogradation, stretto, etc. Each fugue is connected by an to the next, during which the music moves from the key of the last to its successor. The order of the keys follows Hindemith&#x27;s ranking of musical intervals around the tonal center of C.

Another traditional aspect of classical music that Hindemith retains is the idea of dissonance resolving to consonance. Much of Hindemith&#x27;s music begins in consonant territory, progresses into dissonant tension, and resolves in full, consonant chords and cadences. This is especially apparent in his &quot;Concert Music for Strings and Brass&quot; (1930).

==Notable students==
==Recordings==
Hindemith was a prolific composer. He conducted some of his own music in a series of recordings for EMI with the Philharmonia Orchestra and for Deutsche Grammophon with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, which have been digitally remastered and released on CD. The Violin Concerto was also recorded by Decca/London, with the composer conducting the London Symphony Orchestra and David Oistrakh as soloist. Everest Records issued a recording of Hindemith&#x27;s postwar &quot;When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom&#x27;d&quot; (&quot;A Requiem for Those We Love&quot;) on LP, conducted by Hindemith. A stereo recording of Hindemith conducting the requiem with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, with Louise Parker and George London as soloists, was made for Columbia Records in 1963 and later issued on CD. He also appeared on television as a guest conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s nationally syndicated &quot;Music from Chicago&quot; series; the performances have been released by VAI on home video. A complete collection of Hindemith&#x27;s orchestral music was recorded by German and Australian orchestras, all conducted by Werner Andreas Albert and released on the CPO label.

==Hindemithon Festival==
An annual festival of Hindemith&#x27;s music has been held at William Paterson University in Wayne, New Jersey, from 2003 through at least 2017. It features student, staff, and professional musicians performing a range of Hindemith&#x27;s works.

<text>The Santa Ana winds, occasionally referred to as the devil winds, are strong, extremely dry katabatic winds that originate inland and affect coastal Southern California and northern Baja California. They originate from cool, dry high-pressure air masses in the Great Basin.

Santa Ana winds are known for the hot, dry weather that they bring in autumn (often the hottest of the year), but they can also arise at other times of the year. They often bring the lowest relative humidities of the year to coastal Southern California, and &quot;beautifully clear skies&quot;. These low humidities, combined with the warm, compressionally-heated air mass, plus high wind speeds, create critical fire weather conditions, and fan destructive wildfires.

Typically, about 10 to 25 Santa Ana wind events occur annually. A Santa Ana wind can blow from one to seven days, with an average wind event lasting three days. The longest recorded Santa Ana event was a 14-day wind in November 1957. Damage from high winds is most common along the Santa Ana River basin in Orange County, the Santa Clara River basin in Ventura and Los Angeles County, through Newhall Pass into the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles County, and through the Cajon Pass into San Bernardino County near San Bernardino, Fontana, and Chino.

The Santa Ana Winds drive most wildfires in Southern California. Most recently, the winds are known as the force behind the January 2025 Southern California wildfires, having gone on and off for 17 days, starting on January 6th, 2025.

== Description ==

=== Meteorology ===
The Santa Anas are katabatic winds (Greek for &quot;flowing downhill&quot;) arising in higher altitudes and blowing down towards sea level. The National Weather Service defines Santa Ana winds as &quot;a weather condition [in southern California] in which strong, hot, dust-bearing winds descend to the Pacific Coast around Los Angeles from inland desert regions&quot;.

Santa Ana winds originate from high-pressure airmasses over the Great Basin and upper Mojave Desert. Any low-pressure area over the Pacific Ocean, off the coast of California, can change the stability of the Great Basin High, causing a pressure gradient that turns the synoptic scale winds southward down the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada and into the Southern California region. According to one meteorology journal, &quot;a popular rule of thumb used by forecasters is to measure the difference in pressure between the Los Angeles International Airport and Las Vegas; a difference of 9 millibars (0.27 inches of mercury) is enough to support a Santa Ana event.&quot; Dry air flows outward in a clockwise spiral from the high pressure center. This dry airmass sweeps across the deserts of eastern California toward the coast, and encounters the towering Transverse Ranges, which separate coastal Southern California from the deserts. The airmass, flowing from high pressure in the Great Basin to a low pressure center off the coast, takes the path of least resistance by channeling through the mountain passes to the lower coastal elevations, as the low pressure area off the coast pulls the airmass offshore. 

Mountain passes which channel these winds include the Soledad Pass, the Cajon Pass, and the San Gorgonio Pass, all well known for increasing Santa Anas as they are funneled through. This increase in speed, often to near-gale force or above is due to the Venturi effect of the passes. At the same time, as the air descends from higher elevation to lower, the temperature and barometric pressure increase adiabatically, warming about 5 °F for each 1,000 feet it descends (1 °C for each 100 m). Relative humidity decreases with the increasing temperature. The air has already been dried by orographic lift before reaching the Great Basin, as well as by subsidence from the upper atmosphere, so this additional warming often causes relative humidity to fall below 10 percent. 

The end result is a strong, warm, and very dry wind blowing out of the bottom of mountain passes into the valleys and coastal plain. These warm, dry winds, which can easily exceed , can severely exacerbate brush or forest fires, especially under drought conditions.

During Santa Ana conditions it is typically hotter along the coast than in the deserts, with the Southern California coastal region reaching some of its highest annual temperatures in autumn rather than summer. Frigid, dry arctic air from Canada tends to create the most intense Santa Ana winds.
While the Santa Anas are katabatic, they are not Föhn winds. These result from precipitation on the windward side of a mountain range which releases latent heat into the atmosphere which is then warmer on the leeward side (e.g., the Chinook or the original Föhn).

If the Santa Anas are strong, the usual day-time sea breeze may not arise, or develop weak later in the day because the strong offshore desert winds oppose the on-shore sea breeze. At night, the Santa Ana Winds merge with the land breeze blowing from land to sea and strengthen because the inland desert cools more than the ocean due to differences in the heat capacity and because there is no competing sea breeze.

Santa Ana winds are associated in the public mind with dry hot weather, but cold Santa Anas not only exist but have a strong correlation with the highest &quot;regionally averaged&quot; wind speeds.

===Regional impacts===

Santa Ana winds often bring the lowest relative humidities of the year to coastal Southern California. These low humidities, combined with the warm, compressionally-heated air mass, plus the high wind speeds, create critical fire weather conditions. The combination of wind, heat, and dryness accompanying the Santa Ana winds turns the chaparral into explosive fuel feeding the infamous wildfires for which the region is known. 

Although the winds often have a destructive nature, they have some benefits as well. They cause cold water to rise from below the surface layer of the ocean, bringing with it many nutrients that ultimately benefit local fisheries. As the winds blow over the ocean, sea surface temperatures drop about 4°C (7°F), indicating the upwelling. Chlorophyll concentrations in the surface water go from negligible, in the absence of winds, to very active at more than 1.5 milligrams per cubic meter in the presence of the winds.

====Local maritime impacts====
During the Santa Ana winds, large ocean waves can develop. These waves come from a northeasterly direction toward the normally sheltered sides of the Channel Islands, including commonly visited Catalina and Santa Cruz islands. Normally well-sheltered harbors and anchorages such as Avalon and Two Harbors can develop high surf and strong winds that can tear boats from their moorings. During Santa Ana conditions, it is advised that boaters moor on the Southern side of affected islands or return to the mainland.

==Related phenomena==

=== Santa Ana fog ===
A &quot;Santa Ana fog&quot; is a derivative phenomenon in which a ground fog settles in coastal Southern California at the end of a Santa Ana wind episode. When Santa Ana conditions prevail, with winds in the lower of the atmosphere from the north through east, the air over the coastal basin is extremely dry, and this dry air extends out over offshore waters of the Pacific Ocean. When the Santa Ana winds cease, the cool and moist marine layer may re-form rapidly over the ocean if conditions are right. The air in the marine layer becomes very moist and very low clouds or fog occurs. If wind gradients turn on-shore with enough strength, this sea fog is blown onto the coastal areas. This marks a sudden and surprising transition from the hot, dry Santa Ana conditions to cool, moist, and gray marine weather, as the Santa Ana fog can blow onshore and envelop cities in as quickly as fifteen minutes. However, a true Santa Ana fog is rare, because it requires conditions conducive to rapid re-forming of the marine layer, plus a rapid and strong reversal in wind gradients from off-shore to on-shore winds. More often, the high pressure system over the Great Basin, which caused the Santa Ana conditions in the first place, is slow to weaken or move east across the United States. In this more usual case, the Santa Ana winds cease, but warm, dry conditions under a stationary air mass continue for days or even weeks after the Santa Ana wind event ends.

A related phenomenon occurs when the Santa Ana condition is present but weak, allowing hot dry air to accumulate in the inland valleys that may not push all the way to sea level. Under these conditions auto commuters can drive from the San Fernando Valley where conditions are sunny and warm, over the low Santa Monica Mountains, to plunge into the cool cloudy air, low clouds, and fog characteristic of the marine air mass. This and the &quot;Santa Ana fog&quot; above constitute examples of an air inversion.

=== Sundowner winds ===

The similar winds in the Santa Barbara and Goleta area occur most frequently in the late spring to early summer, and are strongest at sunset, or &quot;sundown&quot;; hence their name: sundowner. Because high pressure areas usually migrate east, changing the pressure gradient in Southern California to the northeast, it is common for &quot;sundowner&quot; wind events to precede Santa Ana events by a day or two.

== Historical impact ==

The Santa Ana winds and the accompanying raging wildfires have been a part of the ecosystem of the Los Angeles Basin for over 5,000 years, dating back to the earliest habitation of the region by the Tongva and Tataviam peoples. The Santa Ana winds have been recognized and reported in English-language records as a weather phenomenon in Southern California since at least the mid-nineteenth century. During the Mexican–American War, Commodore Robert Stockton reported that a &quot;strange, dust-laden windstorm&quot; arrived in the night while his troops were marching south through California in January 1847. Various episodes of hot, dry winds have been described over this history as dust storms, hurricane-force winds, and violent north-easters, damaging houses and destroying fruit orchards. Newspaper archives have many photographs of regional damage dating back to the beginnings of news reporting in Los Angeles. When the Los Angeles Basin was primarily an agricultural region, the winds were feared particularly by farmers for their potential to destroy crops.

The strongest Santa Ana winds yet recorded occurred in early December 2011. An atmospheric set-up occurred that allowed the towns of Pasadena and Altadena in the San Gabriel Valley to get whipped by sustained winds at , and gusts up to . Mammoth Mountain experienced a near-record wind gust of , on December 1, 2011.

=== Wildfires ===
Because they are simultaneously &quot;gusty&quot; and &quot;desiccating&quot;, the Santa Ana winds are highly associated with regional wildfire danger. The winds have been implicated in some of the area&#x27;s (and even the state&#x27;s) largest and deadliest wildfires.
Major Santa Ana-fueled fires prior to 2000 included the Santiago Canyon Fire (1889), Bel Air Fire (1961), Agoura-Malibu firestorm (1978), Anaheim Fire (1982), Laguna Fire (1970), Laguna Fire (1993), and Kinneloa Fire (1993).

Major Santa Ana-fueled fires from 2000 to 2019 included Cedar Fire (2003), Old Fire (2003), Esperanza Fire (2006), Witch Creek Fire (2007), October 2007 California wildfires, Tea Fire (2008), Sayre Fire (2008), Freeway Complex Fire (2008), May 2014 San Diego County wildfires, December 2017 Southern California wildfires, and the Thomas Fire (2018).

Major Santa Ana-fueled fires from 2020 to present include the El Dorado Fire (2020), Bobcat Fire (2020), and Franklin Fire (2024). The Santa Ana winds heavily aggravated a series of wildfires in January 2025 including the Eaton Fire and the Palisades Fire during an exceptionally strong wind event. These fires burned through over 35,000 acres (14,163 ha) and have killed 24 people. The winds aggravating the fires reached over in some areas, with wind speeds comparable to that of a Category 1 hurricane.

== Health effects ==
The winds carry &quot;Coccidioides immitis&quot; and &quot;Coccidioides posadasii&quot; spores into nonendemic areas, a pathogenic fungus that causes Coccidioidomycosis (&quot;Valley Fever&quot;). Symptomatic infection (40 percent of cases) usually presents as an influenza-like illness with fever, cough, headaches, rash, and myalgia (muscle pain). Serious complications include severe pneumonia, lung nodules, and disseminated disease, where the fungus spreads throughout the body. The disseminated form of Coccidioidomycosis can devastate the body, causing skin ulcers, abscesses, bone lesions, severe joint pain, heart inflammation, urinary tract problems, meningitis, and often death.

== Name etymology ==
The name &quot;Santa Ana winds&quot; comes from the Santa Ana Canyon in Orange County, one of the many locations where the winds blow intensely. Santa Ana Canyon and Santa Ana River, the old Spanish land grant Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana, and the town of Santa Ana are all so named because the Portolá expedition entered the river valley on Saint Anne&#x27;s feast day in 1769. Newspaper references to the name &quot;Santa Ana winds&quot; appear as far back the 1870s and 1880s. Per the &quot;Riverside Press-Enterprise&quot; in 2020:

The name &quot;Santa Ana wind&quot; became nationally known following a sensationalized 1901 wire story about wind damage. However because local boosters thought the association of the sometimes-destructive winds with the town would be bad for business, they began claiming that calling the &quot;disagreeable&quot; winds the &quot;Santa Ana winds&quot; was &quot;both incorrect and libelous.&quot; The chamber of commerce thus began a misinformation campaign claiming the name was actually &quot;an Indian word&quot; from somewhere. Supposedly, in their telling, the term &quot;Santa Ana wind&quot; derived from a Native American phrase for &quot;big wind&quot; or &quot;devil wind&quot; that was then altered by Californios into the form &quot;Satanás&quot; (meaning Satan), and then still later corrupted into &quot;Santa Ana.&quot; However, an authority on local Native American languages claims this supposed Indigenous term, &quot;Santana&quot; or &quot;sandana,&quot; never existed. No evidence has ever emerged to support this explanation and it is a false etymology. Another false association is that the name is a reference to General Santa Anna of Mexico and dust clouds kicked up by his cavalry horses. The &quot;Santa Ana Journal&quot; newspaper which battled for years to discourage the association between the winds and the town, published a verse with a 1935 news story on wind impacts that nodded to the &quot;devil winds&quot; nomenclature: &quot;The devil sends the naughty winds To blow the skirts on high; But God is just and sends the dust To fill the bad man&#x27;s eye.&quot;

In 1933, Father John O&#x27;Connell of Mission San Juan Capistrano reported that Don Jesus Aguilar, born 1855 at Capistrano, said that in his day the winds had been called &quot;el viento del norte&quot; (&quot;the north wind&quot;).

== In popular culture ==
Santa Ana winds are widely believed to affect people&#x27;s moods and behavior. The Santa Ana winds are commonly portrayed in fiction as being responsible for a tense, uneasy, wrathful mood among Angelenos. The winds blow things over and &quot;make loud noises,&quot; which can set people on edge. As &quot;The New York Times&quot; put it in 2003, &quot;a dry, hot Santa Ana often symbolizes an unnamable menace lying just beneath the sun-shot surface of California life.&quot; According to the book blog, the winds notably appear in Richard Henry Dana&#x27;s &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot;, the Philip Marlowe story &quot;Red Wind&quot; by Raymond Chandler, three essays by Joan Didion (&quot;Some Dreamers of the Golden Dream&quot; and &quot;Los Angeles Notebook&quot;, both included in her 1968 book &quot;Slouching Towards Bethlehem&quot;, and &quot;Fire Season&quot;, included in her 1992 book &quot;After Henry&quot;), &quot;The Husband&quot; by Dean Koontz, &quot;White Oleander&quot; by Janet Fitch, and &quot;Less than Zero&quot; by Bret Easton Ellis. In Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s 2009 &quot;California novel&quot; &quot;Inherent Vice&quot; the winds make an appearance and, per one scholar, &quot;the obligatory noir description of their effects appears on page 98.&quot; 

&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; columnist David L. Ulin commented, &quot;...for writers such as Didion and Chandler, the Santa Ana is an emblem of disruption because, for them, Los Angeles is a disrupted world. We can take issue with that impression of the city; I sometimes do and sometimes don&#x27;t. But when the Santa Ana starts to blow, I invariably grow edgy...unable, in the most concrete sense, to settle myself down.&quot;



Some of this experienced mood shift is likely due to the increase of static electricity in dry conditions. California folklore therefore credits the winds with &quot;strange luminosity in the form of sparks and glows that accompany the winds&quot; and an excess of &quot;positive ions, disrupting health, well-being, and temperament.&quot;

<doc id="81473" wikidata="Q156774" url="?curid=81473" title="Pedro II of Brazil">
<text>&quot;Dom&quot; PedroII (2 December 1825 – 5 December 1891), nicknamed the Magnanimous (), was the second and last monarch of the Empire of Brazil, reigning for over 58 years. 

Pedro II was born in Rio de Janeiro, the seventh child of Emperor Dom Pedro I of Brazil and Empress Dona Maria Leopoldina and thus a member of the Brazilian branch of the House of Braganza (). His father&#x27;s abrupt abdication and departure to Europe in 1831 left the five-year-old as emperor and led to a lonely childhood and adolescence, obliged to spend his time studying in preparation for rule. His experiences with court intrigues and political disputes during this period greatly affected his later character; he grew into a man with a strong sense of duty and devotion toward his country and his people, yet increasingly resentful of his role as monarch.

Pedro II inherited an empire on the verge of disintegration, but he turned Brazil into an emerging power in the international arena. The nation grew to be distinguished from its Hispanic neighbors on account of its political stability, freedom of speech, respect for civil rights, vibrant economic growth, and form of government—a functional representative parliamentary monarchy. Brazil was also victorious in the Platine War, the Uruguayan War, and the Paraguayan War, as well as prevailing in several other international disputes and domestic tensions. Pedro II pushed through the abolition of slavery despite opposition from powerful political and economic interests. The Emperor established a reputation as a vigorous sponsor of learning, culture, and the sciences, and he won the respect and admiration of intellectuals such as Charles Darwin, Victor Hugo, and Friedrich Nietzsche, and was a friend to Richard Wagner, Louis Pasteur, and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, among others.

The Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d&#x27;état that had almost no support outside a clique of military leaders who desired a form of republic headed by a dictator. Pedro II had become weary of emperorship and despaired over the monarchy&#x27;s future prospects, despite its overwhelming popular support. He did not allow his ouster to be opposed and did not support any attempt to restore the monarchy. He spent the last two years of his life in exile in Europe, living alone on very little money.

The reign of Pedro II ended while he was highly regarded by the people and at the pinnacle of his popularity, and some of his accomplishments were reversed as Brazil slipped into a long period of weak governments, dictatorships, and constitutional and economic crises. The men who had exiled him soon began to see in him a model for the Brazilian Republic. A few decades after his death, his reputation was restored and his remains were returned to Brazil with celebrations nationwide. Historians have regarded the Emperor positively and several have ranked him as the greatest Brazilian.

== Early life ==
=== Birth ===

Pedro was born at 02:30 on 2 December 1825 in the Palace of São Cristóvão, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Named after St. Peter of Alcantara, his name in full was Pedro de Alcântara João Carlos Leopoldo Salvador Bibiano Francisco Xavier de Paula Leocádio Miguel Gabriel Rafael Gonzaga. Through his father, Emperor Dom Pedro I, he was a member of the Brazilian branch of the House of Braganza () and was referred to using the honorific &quot;Dom&quot; (Lord) from birth. He was the grandson of King Dom João VI of Portugal and nephew of Dom Miguel I. His mother was the Archduchess Maria Leopoldina of Austria, daughter of Franz II, the last Holy Roman Emperor. Through his mother, Pedro was a nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte and first cousin of Emperors Napoleon II of France, Franz Joseph I of Austria-Hungary and Don Maximiliano I of Mexico.

The only legitimate male child of Pedro I to survive infancy, he was officially recognized as heir apparent to the Brazilian throne with the title Prince Imperial on 6 August 1826. Empress Maria Leopoldina died on 11 December 1826, a few days after a stillbirth, when Pedro was a year old. Two and a half years later, his father married Princess Amélie of Leuchtenberg. Prince Pedro developed an affectionate relationship with her, whom he came to regard as his mother. Pedro I&#x27;s desire to restore his daughter Maria II to her Portuguese throne, which had been usurped by his brother Miguel I, as well as his declining political position at home led to his abrupt abdication on 7 April 1831. He and Amélie immediately departed for Europe, leaving behind the Prince Imperial, who became Emperor Dom Pedro II.

=== Early coronation ===

Upon leaving the country, Emperor Pedro I selected three people to take charge of his son and remaining daughters. The first was José Bonifácio de Andrada, his friend and an influential leader during Brazilian independence, who was named guardian. The second was Mariana de Verna, who had held the post of &quot;aia&quot; (governess) since the birth of Pedro II. As a child, the then-Prince Imperial called her &quot;Dadama&quot;, as he could not pronounce the word &quot;dama&quot; (Lady) correctly. He regarded her as his surrogate mother and would continue to call her by her nickname well into adulthood out of affection. The third person was Rafael, an Afro-Brazilian veteran of the Cisplatine War. He was an employee in the Palace of São Cristóvão whom Pedro I deeply trusted and asked to look after his son—a charge that he carried out for the rest of his life.

Bonifácio was dismissed from his position in December 1833 and replaced by another guardian. Pedro II spent his days studying, with only two hours set aside for amusements. Intelligent, he was able to acquire knowledge with great ease. However, the hours of study were strenuous and the preparation for his role as monarch was demanding. He had few friends of his age and limited contact with his sisters. All that coupled with the sudden loss of his parents gave Pedro II an unhappy and lonely upbringing. The environment in which he was raised turned him into a shy and needy person who saw books as a refuge and retreat from the real world.

The possibility of lowering the young Emperor&#x27;s age of majority, instead of waiting until he turned 18, had been floated since 1835. His elevation to the throne had led to a troublesome period of endless crises. The regency created to rule on his behalf was plagued from the start by disputes between political factions and rebellions across the nation. Those politicians who had risen to power during the 1830s had by now also become familiar with the pitfalls of rule. Historian Roderick J. Barman stated that by 1840, &quot;they had lost all faith in their ability to rule the country on their own. They accepted Pedro II as an authority figure whose presence was indispensable for the country&#x27;s survival&quot;. When asked by politicians if he would like to assume full powers, Pedro II accepted. On the following day, 23 July 1840, the General Assembly (the Brazilian Parliament) formally declared the 14-year-old Pedro II of age. He was later acclaimed, crowned, and consecrated on 18 July 1841.

== Consolidation ==
=== Imperial authority established ===

Removal of the factious regency brought stability to the government. Pedro II was seen nationwide as a legitimate source of authority, whose position placed him above partisanship and petty disputes. He was, however, still no more than a boy, and a shy, insecure, and immature one. His nature resulted from his broken childhood, when he experienced abandonment, intrigue, and betrayal. Behind the scenes, a group of high-ranking palace servants and notable politicians led by Aureliano Coutinho (later Viscount of Sepetiba) became known as the &quot;Courtier Faction&quot; as they established influence over the young Emperor. Some were very close to him, such as Mariana de Verna and Steward Paulo Barbosa da Silva. Pedro II was deftly used by the Courtiers against their actual or suspected foes.

The Brazilian government secured the hand of Princess Teresa Cristina of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. She and Pedro II were married by proxy in Naples on 30 May 1843. Upon seeing her in person, the Emperor was noticeably disappointed. Teresa Cristina was short, a bit overweight, and not considered conventionally pretty. He did little to hide his disillusionment. One observer stated that he turned his back to Teresa Cristina, another depicted him as being so shocked that he needed to sit. That evening, Pedro II wept and complained to Mariana de Verna, &quot;They have deceived me, &quot;Dadama&quot;!&quot; It took several hours to convince him that duty demanded that he proceed. The Nuptial Mass, with the ratification of the vows previously taken by proxy and the conferral of the nuptial blessing, occurred on the following day, 4 September.

In late 1845 and early 1846, the Emperor made a tour of Brazil&#x27;s southern provinces, traveling through São Paulo (of which Paraná was a part at this time), Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul. He was buoyed by the warm and enthusiastic responses he received. By then Pedro II had matured physically and mentally. He grew into a man who, at tall with blue eyes and blond hair, was seen as handsome. With growth, his weaknesses faded and his strengths of character came to the fore. He became self-assured and learned to be not only impartial and diligent, but also courteous, patient and personable. Barman said that he kept &quot;his emotions under iron discipline. He was never rude and never lost his temper. He was exceptionally discreet in words and cautious in action.&quot; Most importantly, this period saw the end of the Courtier Faction. Pedro II began to fully exercise authority and successfully engineered the end of the courtiers&#x27; influence by removing them from his inner circle while avoiding any public disruption.

=== Abolition of the slave trade and war ===

Pedro II was faced by three crises between 1848 and 1852. The first test came in confronting the trade in illegally imported slaves. This had been banned in 1826 as part of a treaty with the United Kingdom. Trafficking continued unabated, however, and the British government&#x27;s passage of the Slave Trade (Brazil) Act 1845 (8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. 122) authorized British warships to board Brazilian shipping and seize any found involved in the slave trade. While Brazil grappled with this problem, the Praieira revolt erupted on 6 November 1848. This was a conflict between local political factions within Pernambuco province; it was suppressed by March 1849. The Eusébio de Queirós Law was promulgated on 4 September 1850 which gave the Brazilian government broad authority to combat the illegal slave trade. With this new tool, Brazil moved to eliminate importation of slaves. By 1852 this first crisis was over, and Britain accepted that the trade had been suppressed.

The third crisis entailed a conflict with the Argentine Confederation regarding ascendancy over territories adjacent to the Río de la Plata and free navigation of that waterway. Since the 1830s, Argentine dictator Juan Manuel de Rosas had supported rebellions within Uruguay and Brazil. It was only in 1850 that Brazil was able to address the threat posed by Rosas. An alliance was forged between Brazil, Uruguay and disaffected Argentines, leading to the Platine War and the subsequent overthrow of the Argentine ruler in February 1852. Barman said that a &quot;considerable portion of the credit must be ... assigned to the Emperor, whose cool head, tenacity of purpose, and sense of what was feasible proved indispensable.&quot;

The Empire&#x27;s successful navigation of these crises considerably enhanced the nation&#x27;s stability and prestige, and Brazil emerged as a hemispheric power. Internationally, Europeans began to regard the country as embodying familiar liberal ideals, such as freedom of the press and constitutional respect for civil liberties. Its representative parliamentary monarchy also stood in stark contrast to the mix of dictatorships and instability endemic in the other nations of South America during this period.

== Growth ==
=== Pedro II and politics ===

At the beginning of the 1850s, Brazil enjoyed internal stability and economic prosperity. Under the prime ministry of Honório Hermeto Carneiro Leão (then-Viscount and later Marquis of Paraná) the Emperor advanced his own ambitious program: the &quot;conciliação&quot; (conciliation) and &quot;melhoramentos&quot; (material developments). Pedro II&#x27;s reforms aimed to promote less political partisanship, and forward infrastructure and economic development. The nation was being interconnected through railroad, electrical telegraph, and steamship lines, uniting it into a single entity. The general opinion, both at home and abroad, was that these accomplishments had been possible due to Brazil&#x27;s &quot;governance as a monarchy and the character of Pedro II&quot;.

Pedro II was neither a British-style figurehead nor an autocrat in the manner of Russian czars. The Emperor exercised power through cooperation with elected politicians, economic interests, and popular support. The active presence of Pedro II on the political scene was an important part of the government&#x27;s structure, which also included the cabinet, the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate (the latter two formed the General Assembly). He used his participation in directing the course of government as a means of influence. His direction became indispensable, although it never devolved into &quot;one-man rule.&quot; In his handling of the political parties, he &quot;needed to maintain a reputation for impartiality, work in accord with the popular mood, and avoid any flagrant imposition of his will on the political scene.&quot;

The Emperor&#x27;s more notable political successes were achieved primarily because of the non-confrontational and cooperative manner with which he approached both issues and the partisan figures with whom he had to deal. He was remarkably tolerant, seldom taking offense at criticism, opposition or even incompetence. He did not have the constitutional authority to force acceptance of his initiatives without support, and his collaborative approach towards governing kept the nation progressing and enabled the political system to successfully function. The Emperor respected the prerogatives of the legislature, even when they resisted, delayed, or thwarted his goals and appointments. Most politicians appreciated and supported his role. Many had lived through the regency period, when the lack of an emperor who could stand above petty and special interests led to years of strife between political factions. Their experiences in public life had created a conviction that Pedro II was &quot;indispensable to Brazil&#x27;s continued peace and prosperity.&quot;

=== Domestic life ===

The marriage between Pedro II and Teresa Cristina started off badly. With maturity, patience and their first child, Afonso, their relationship improved. Later Teresa Cristina gave birth to more children: Isabel, in 1846; Leopoldina, in 1847; and lastly, Pedro Afonso, in 1848. Both boys died when very young, which devastated the Emperor and completely changed his view of the Empire&#x27;s future. Despite his affection for his daughters, he did not believe that Princess Isabel, although his heir, would have any chance of prospering on the throne. He felt his successor needed to be male for the monarchy to be viable. He increasingly saw the imperial system as being tied so inextricably to himself, that it would not survive him. Isabel and her sister received a remarkable education, although they were given no preparation for governing the nation. Pedro II excluded Isabel from participation in government business and decisions.

Sometime around 1850, Pedro II began having discreet affairs with other women. The most famous and enduring of these relationships involved Luísa Margarida Portugal de Barros, Countess of Barral, with whom he formed a romantic and intimate, though not adulterous, friendship after she was appointed governess to the emperor&#x27;s daughters in November 1856. Throughout his life, the Emperor held onto a hope of finding a soulmate, something he felt cheated of due to the necessity of a marriage of state to a woman for whom he never felt passion. This is but one instance illustrating his dual identity: one who assiduously carried out his duty as emperor and another who considered the imperial office an unrewarding burden and who was happier in the worlds of literature and science.

Pedro II was hard-working and his routine was demanding. He usually woke up at 7:00 and did not sleep before 2:00 in the morning. His entire day was devoted to the affairs of state and the meager free time available was spent reading and studying. The Emperor went about his daily routine dressed in a simple black tail coat, trousers, and cravat. For special occasions he would wear court dress, and he only appeared in full regalia with crown, mantle, and scepter twice each year at the opening and closing of the General Assembly. Pedro II held politicians and government officials to the strict standards which he exemplified. The Emperor adopted a strict policy for the selection of civil servants based on morality and merit. To set the standard, he lived simply, once having said: &quot;I also understand that useless expenditure is the same as stealing from the Nation&quot;. Balls and assemblies of the Court ceased after 1852. He also refused to request or allow his civil list amount of R$800,000 per year (US$405,000 or £90,000 in 1840) to be raised from the declaration of his majority until his dethronement almost fifty years later.

=== Patron of arts and sciences ===

&quot;I was born to devote myself to culture and sciences,&quot; the Emperor remarked in his private journal during 1862. He had always been eager to learn and found in books a refuge from the demands of his position. Subjects which interested Pedro II were wide-ranging, including anthropology, history, geography, geology, medicine, law, religious studies, philosophy, painting, sculpture, theater, music, chemistry, physics, astronomy, poetry, and technology among others. By the end of his reign, there were three libraries in São Cristóvão palace containing more than 60,000 books. A passion for linguistics prompted him throughout his life to study new languages, and he was able to speak and write not only Portuguese but also Latin, French, German, English, Italian, Spanish, Greek, Arabic, Hebrew, Sanskrit, Chinese, Occitan, and Tupi. He became the first Brazilian photographer when he acquired a daguerreotype camera in March 1840. He set up one laboratory in São Cristóvão devoted to photography and another to chemistry and physics. He also had an astronomical observatory constructed.

The Emperor considered education to be of national importance and was himself a concrete example of the value of learning. He remarked: &quot;Were I not an Emperor, I would like to be a teacher. I do not know of a task more noble than to direct young minds and prepare the men of tomorrow.&quot; His reign saw the creation of the Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute to promote research and preservation in the historical, geographical, cultural, and social sciences. The Imperial Academy of Music and National Opera and the Pedro II School were also founded, the latter serving as a model for schools throughout Brazil. The Imperial Academy of the Fine Arts, established by his father, received further strengthening and support. Using his civil list income, Pedro II provided scholarships for Brazilian students to study at universities, art schools, and conservatories of music in Europe. He also financed the creation of the Institute Pasteur, helped underwrite the construction of Wagner&#x27;s Bayreuth Festspielhaus, as well as subscribing to similar projects. His efforts were recognized both at home and abroad. Charles Darwin said of him: &quot;The Emperor does so much for science, that every scientific man is bound to show him the utmost respect&quot;.

Pedro II became a member of the Royal Society, the Russian Academy of Sciences, The Royal Academies for Science and the Arts of Belgium and the American Geographical Society. In 1875, he was elected to the French Academy of Sciences, an honor previously granted to only two other heads of state: Peter the Great and Napoleon Bonaparte. He exchanged letters with scientists, philosophers, musicians and other intellectuals. Many of his correspondents became his friends, including Richard Wagner, Louis Pasteur, Louis Agassiz, John Greenleaf Whittier, Michel Eugène Chevreul, Alexander Graham Bell, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Arthur de Gobineau, Frédéric Mistral, Alessandro Manzoni, Alexandre Herculano, Camilo Castelo Branco, and James Cooley Fletcher. His erudition amazed Friedrich Nietzsche when the two met. Victor Hugo told the Emperor: &quot;Sire, you are a great citizen, you are the grandson of Marcus Aurelius,&quot; and Alexandre Herculano called him a &quot;Prince whom the general opinion holds as the foremost of his era because of his gifted mind, and due to the constant application of that gift to the sciences and culture.&quot;

=== Clash with the British Empire ===
At the end of 1859, Pedro II departed on a trip to provinces north of the capital, visiting Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas, Pernambuco, and Paraíba. He returned in February 1860 after four months. The trip was a huge success, with the Emperor welcomed everywhere with warmth and joy. The first half of the 1860s saw peace and prosperity in Brazil. Civil liberties were maintained. Freedom of speech had existed since Brazil&#x27;s independence and was strongly defended by Pedro II. He found newspapers from the capital and from the provinces an ideal way to keep track of public opinion and the nation&#x27;s overall situation. Another means of monitoring the Empire was through direct contacts with his subjects. One opportunity for this was during regular Tuesday and Saturday public audiences, where anyone of any social class, including slaves, could gain admittance and present their petitions and stories. Visits to schools, colleges, prisons, exhibitions, factories, barracks, and other public appearances presented further opportunities to gather first-hand information.

This tranquility temporarily disappeared when the British consul in Rio de Janeiro, William Dougal Christie, nearly sparked a war between his nation and Brazil. Christie sent an ultimatum containing bullying demands arising out of two minor incidents at the end of 1861 and beginning of 1862. The first was the sinking of a British merchant barque on the coast of Rio Grande do Sul after which its goods were pillaged by local inhabitants. The second was the arrest of a group of drunken British sailors who were causing a disturbance in the streets of Rio.

The Brazilian government refused to yield, and Christie issued orders for British warships to capture Brazilian merchant vessels as indemnity. Brazil prepared for what was seen as an imminent conflict. Pedro II was the main reason for Brazil&#x27;s resistance; he rejected any suggestion of yielding. This response came as a surprise to Christie, who changed his tenor and proposed a peaceful settlement through international arbitration. The Brazilian government presented its demands and, upon seeing the British government&#x27;s position weaken, severed diplomatic ties with Britain in June 1863.

== Paraguayan War ==

=== First Fatherland Volunteer ===
As war with the British Empire threatened, Brazil had to turn its attention to its southern frontiers. Another civil war had begun in Uruguay as its political parties turned against each other. The internal conflict led to the murder of Brazilians and looting of their property in Uruguay. Brazil&#x27;s government decided to intervene, fearful of giving any impression of weakness in the face of conflict with the British. A Brazilian army invaded Uruguay in December 1864, beginning the brief Uruguayan War, which ended in February 1865. Meanwhile, the dictator of Paraguay, Francisco Solano López, took advantage of the situation to establish his country as a regional power. The Paraguayan Army invaded the Brazilian province of Mato Grosso (the area known after 1977 as the state of Mato Grosso do Sul), triggering the Paraguayan War. Four months later, Paraguayan troops invaded Argentine territory as a prelude to an attack on Rio Grande do Sul.

Aware of the anarchy in Rio Grande do Sul and the incapacity and incompetence of its military chiefs to resist the Paraguayan army, Pedro II decided to go to the front in person. Upon receiving objections from the cabinet, the General Assembly and the Council of State, Pedro II pronounced: &quot;If they can prevent me from going as an Emperor, they cannot prevent me from abdicating and going as a Fatherland Volunteer&quot;—an allusion to those Brazilians who volunteered to go to war and became known throughout the nation as the &quot;Fatherland Volunteers&quot;. The monarch himself was popularly called the &quot;number-one volunteer&quot;. Given permission to leave, Pedro II disembarked in Rio Grande do Sul in July and proceeded from there by land. He travelled overland by horse and wagon, sleeping at night in a campaign tent. In September, Pedro II arrived in Uruguaiana, a Brazilian town occupied by a besieged Paraguayan army.

The Emperor rode within rifle-shot of Uruguaiana, but the Paraguayans did not attack him. To avoid further bloodshed, he offered terms of surrender to the Paraguayan commander, who accepted. Pedro II&#x27;s coordination of the military operations and his personal example played a decisive role in successfully repulsing the Paraguayan invasion of Brazilian territory. Before returning to Rio de Janeiro, he received the British diplomatic envoy Edward Thornton, who apologized on behalf of Queen Victoria and the British Government for the crisis between the empires. The Emperor regarded this diplomatic victory over the most powerful nation of the world as sufficient and renewed friendly relations.

=== Total victory and its heavy costs ===

Against all expectations, the war continued for five years. During this period, Pedro II&#x27;s time and energy were devoted to the war effort. He tirelessly worked to raise and equip troops to reinforce the front lines and to push forward the fitting of new warships for the navy. The rape of women, widespread violence against civilians, ransacking and destruction of properties that had occurred during Paraguay&#x27;s invasion of Brazilian territory had made a deep impression on him. He warned the Countess of Barral in November 1866 that &quot;the war should be concluded as honor demands, cost what it cost.&quot; &quot;Difficulties, setbacks, and war-weariness had no effect on his quiet resolve&quot;, said Barman. Mounting casualties did not distract him from advancing what he saw as Brazil&#x27;s righteous cause, and he stood prepared to personally sacrifice his own throne to gain an honorable outcome. Writing in his journal a few years previously Pedro II remarked: &quot;What sort of fear could I have? That they take the government from me? Many better kings than I have lost it, and to me it is no more than the weight of a cross which it is my duty to carry.&quot;

At the same time, Pedro II worked to prevent quarrels between the national political parties from impairing the military response. The Emperor prevailed over a serious political crisis in July 1868 resulting from a quarrel between the cabinet and Luís Alves de Lima e Silva (then-Marques and later Duke of Caxias), the commander-in-chief of the Brazilian forces in Paraguay. Caxias was also a politician and was a member of the opposing party to the ministry. The Emperor sided with him, leading to the cabinet&#x27;s resignation. As Pedro II maneuvered to bring about a victorious outcome in the conflict with Paraguay, he threw his support behind the political parties and factions that seemed to be most useful in the effort. The reputation of the monarchy was harmed and its trusted position as an impartial mediator was severely impacted in the long term. He was unconcerned for his personal position, and regardless of the impact upon the imperial system, he determined to put the national interest ahead of any potential harm caused by such expediencies.

His refusal to accept anything short of total victory was pivotal in the outcome. His tenacity was well-paid with the news that López had died in battle on 1 March 1870, bringing the war to a close. Pedro II turned down the General Assembly&#x27;s suggestion to erect an equestrian statue of him to commemorate the victory and chose instead to use the money to build elementary schools.

== Apogee ==
=== Abolitionism ===

In the 1870s, progress was made in both social and political spheres as segments of society benefited from the reforms and shared in the increasing prosperity. Brazil&#x27;s international reputation for political stability and investment potential greatly improved. The Empire was seen as a modern and progressive nation unequaled, with the exception of the United States, in the Americas. The economy began growing rapidly and immigration flourished. Railroad, shipping and other modernization projects were adopted. With &quot;slavery destined for extinction and other reforms projected, the prospects for &#x27;moral and material advances&#x27; seemed vast.&quot;

In 1870, few Brazilians opposed slavery and even fewer openly condemned it. Pedro II, who did not own slaves, was one of the few who did oppose slavery. Its abolition was a delicate subject. Slaves were used by all classes, from the richest to the poorest. Pedro II wanted to end the practice gradually to soften the impact to the national economy. With no constitutional authority to directly intervene to abolish slavery, the Emperor would need to use all his skills to convince, influence, and gather support among politicians to achieve his goal. His first open move occurred back in 1850, when he threatened to abdicate unless the General Assembly declared the Atlantic slave trade illegal.

Having dealt with the overseas supply of new slaves, Pedro II turned his attention in the early 1860s to removing the remaining source: enslavement of children born to slaves. Legislation was drafted at his initiative, but the conflict with Paraguay delayed discussion of the proposal in the General Assembly. Pedro II openly asked for the gradual eradication of slavery in the speech from the throne of 1867. He was heavily criticized, and his move was condemned as &quot;national suicide.&quot; Critics argued &quot;that abolition was his personal desire and not that of the nation.&quot; He consciously ignored the growing political damage to his image and to the monarchy in consequence of his support for abolition. Eventually, a bill pushed through by Prime Minister José Paranhos, was enacted as the Law of Free Birth on 28 September 1871, under which all children born to slave women after that date were considered free born.

=== To Europe and North Africa ===

On 25 May 1871, Pedro II and his wife traveled to Europe. He had long desired to vacation abroad. When news arrived that his younger daughter, the 23-year-old Leopoldina, had died in Vienna of typhoid fever on 7 February, he finally had a pressing reason to venture outside the Empire. Upon arriving in Lisbon, Portugal, he immediately went to the &quot;Janelas Verdes&quot; palace, where he met with his stepmother, Amélie of Leuchtenberg. The two had not seen each other in forty years, and the meeting was emotional. Pedro II remarked in his journal: &quot;I cried from happiness and also from sorrow seeing my Mother so affectionate toward me but so aged and so sick.&quot;

The Emperor proceeded to visit Spain, Great Britain, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Italy, Egypt, Greece, Switzerland, and France. In Coburg, he visited his daughter&#x27;s tomb. He found this to be &quot;a time of release and freedom&quot;. He traveled under the assumed name &quot;Dom Pedro de Alcântara&quot;, insisting upon being treated informally and staying only in hotels. He spent his days sightseeing and conversing with scientists and other intellectuals with whom he shared interests. The European sojourn proved to be a success, and his demeanor and curiosity won respectful notices in the nations which he visited. The prestige of both Brazil and Pedro II were further enhanced during the tour when news came from Brazil that the Law of Free Birth, abolishing the last source of enslavement, had been ratified. The imperial party returned to Brazil in triumph on 31 March 1872.

=== Religious Issue ===

Soon after returning to Brazil, Pedro II was faced with an unexpected crisis. The Brazilian clergy had long been understaffed, undisciplined and poorly educated, leading to a great loss of respect for the Catholic Church. The imperial government had embarked upon a program of reform to address these deficiencies. As Catholicism was the state religion, the government exercised a great deal of control over Church affairs, paying clerical salaries, appointing parish priests, nominating bishops, ratifying papal bulls and overseeing seminaries. In pursuing reform, the government selected bishops who satisfied its criteria for education, support for reform and moral fitness. However, as more capable men began to fill the clerical ranks, resentment of government control over the Church increased.

The bishops of Olinda and Belém (in the provinces of Pernambuco and Pará, respectively) were two of the new generation of educated and zealous Brazilian clerics. They had been influenced by the ultramontanism, which spread among Catholics in this period. In 1872, they ordered Freemasons expelled from lay brotherhoods. While European Freemasonry often tended towards atheism and anti-clericalism, things were much different in Brazil where membership in Masonic orders was common—although Pedro II himself was not a Freemason. The government headed by the Viscount of Rio Branco tried on two separate occasions to persuade the bishops to repeal, but they refused. This led to their trial and conviction by the Superior Court of Justice. In 1874, they were sentenced four years at hard labor, although the Emperor commuted this to imprisonment only.

Pedro II played a decisive role by unequivocally backing the government&#x27;s actions. He was a conscientious adherent of Catholicism, which he viewed as advancing important civilizing and civic values. While he avoided anything that could be considered unorthodox, he felt free to think and behave independently. The Emperor accepted new ideas, such as Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution, of which he remarked that &quot;the laws that he [Darwin] has discovered glorify the Creator&quot;. He was moderate in his religious beliefs but could not accept disrespect to civil law and government authority. As he told his son-in-law: &quot;[The government] has to ensure that the constitution is obeyed. In these proceedings there is no desire to protect masonry; but rather the goal of upholding the rights of the civilian power.&quot; The crisis was resolved in September 1875 after the Emperor grudgingly agreed to grant full amnesty to the bishops and the Holy See annulled the interdicts.

=== To the United States, Europe, and Middle East ===

Once again, the Emperor traveled abroad, this time going to the United States. He was accompanied by his faithful servant Rafael, who had raised him from childhood. Pedro II arrived in New York City on 15 April 1876, and set out from there to travel throughout the country; going as far as San Francisco in the west, New Orleans in the south, Washington, D.C., and north to Toronto, Canada. The trip was &quot;an unalloyed triumph&quot;, Pedro II making a deep impression on the American people with his simplicity and kindness. He then crossed the Atlantic, where he visited Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Russia, the Ottoman Empire, Greece, the Holy Land, Egypt, Italy, Austria, Germany, France, Britain, Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Portugal. He returned to Brazil on 22 September 1877.
Pedro II&#x27;s trips abroad made a deep psychological impact. While traveling, he was largely freed of the restrictions imposed by his office. Under the pseudonym &quot;Pedro de Alcântara&quot;, he enjoyed moving about as an ordinary person, even taking a train journey solely with his wife. Only while touring abroad could the Emperor shake off the formal existence and demands of the life he knew in Brazil. It became more difficult to reacclimate to his routine as head of state upon returning. Upon his sons&#x27; early deaths, the Emperor&#x27;s faith in the monarchy&#x27;s future had evaporated. His trips abroad now made him resentful of the emperorship assigned to him at the age of five. If he previously had no interest in securing the throne for the next generation, he now had no desire to keep it going during his own lifetime.

== Decline and fall ==
=== Decline ===

During the 1880s, Brazil continued to prosper, and social diversity increased markedly, including the first organized push for women&#x27;s rights. On the other hand, letters written by Pedro II reveal a man grown world-weary with age and having an increasingly alienated and pessimistic outlook. He remained respectful of his duty and was meticulous in performing the tasks demanded of the imperial office, albeit often without enthusiasm. Because of his increasing &quot;indifference towards the fate of the regime&quot; and his lack of action in support of the imperial system once it was challenged, historians have attributed the &quot;prime, perhaps sole, responsibility&quot; for the dissolution of the monarchy to the Emperor himself.

After their experience of the perils and obstacles of government, the political figures who had arisen during the 1830s saw the Emperor as providing a fundamental source of authority essential for governing and for national survival. These elder statesmen began to die off or retire from government until, by the 1880s, they had almost entirely been replaced by a newer generation of politicians who had no experience of the early years of Pedro II&#x27;s reign. They had only known a stable administration and prosperity and saw no reason to uphold and defend the imperial office as a unifying force beneficial to the nation. To them, Pedro II was merely an old and increasingly sick man who had steadily eroded his position by taking an active role in politics for decades. Before he had been above criticism, but now his every action and inaction prompted meticulous scrutiny and open criticism. Many young politicians had become apathetic toward the monarchic regime and, when the time came, they would do nothing to defend it. Pedro II&#x27;s achievements went unremembered and unconsidered by the ruling elites. By his very success, the Emperor had made his position seem unnecessary.

The lack of an heir who could feasibly provide a new direction for the nation also diminished the long-term prospects of the Brazilian monarchy. The Emperor loved his daughter Isabel, but he considered the idea of a female successor as antithetical to the role required of Brazil&#x27;s ruler. He viewed the death of his two sons as being a sign that the Empire was destined to be supplanted. Resistance to accepting a female ruler was also shared by the political establishment. Even though the Constitution allowed female succession to the throne, Brazil was still very traditional, and only a male successor was thought capable as head of state.

=== Abolition of slavery and coup d&#x27;état ===

By June 1887, the Emperor&#x27;s health had considerably worsened, and his personal doctors suggested going to Europe for medical treatment. While in Milan he passed two weeks between life and death, even being anointed. While on a bed recovering, on 22 May 1888 he received news that slavery had been abolished in Brazil. With a weak voice and tears in his eyes, he said, &quot;Great people! Great people!&quot; Pedro II returned to Brazil and disembarked in Rio de Janeiro in August 1888. The &quot;whole country welcomed him with an enthusiasm never seen before. From the capital, from the provinces, from everywhere, arrived proofs of affection and veneration.&quot; With the devotion expressed by Brazilians upon the return of the Emperor and the Empress from Europe, the monarchy seemed to enjoy unshakable support and to be at the height of its popularity.

The nation enjoyed great international prestige during the final years of the Empire, and it had become an emerging power within the international arena. Predictions of economic and labor disruption caused by the abolition of slavery failed to materialize and the 1888 coffee harvest was successful. The end of slavery had resulted in an explicit shift of support to republicanism by rich and powerful coffee farmers who held great political, economic, and social power in the country. Republicanism was an elitist creed which never flourished in Brazil, with little support in the provinces. The combination of republican ideas and the dissemination of positivism among the army&#x27;s lower and medium officer ranks led to indiscipline among the corps and became a serious threat to the monarchy. They dreamed of a dictatorial republic, which they believed would be superior to the monarchy.

Although there was no desire in Brazil among the majority of the population to change the form of government, the civilian republicans began pressuring army officers to overthrow the monarchy. They launched a coup d&#x27;état, arrested Prime Minister Afonso Celso, Viscount of Ouro Preto and instituted the republic on 15 November 1889. The few people who witnessed what occurred did not realize that it was a rebellion. Historian Lídia Besouchet noted that &quot;[r]arely has a revolution been so minor.&quot; During the ordeal, Pedro II showed no emotion as if unconcerned about the outcome. He dismissed all suggestions for quelling the rebellion that politicians and military leaders put forward. When he heard the news of his deposition he simply commented: &quot;If it is so, it will be my retirement. I have worked too hard and I am tired. I will go rest then.&quot; He and his family were sent into exile in Europe on 17 November.

== Exile and legacy ==

=== Last years ===
Teresa Cristina died three weeks after their arrival in Europe, and Isabel and her family moved to another place while Pedro settled first in Cannes and later in Paris. Pedro&#x27;s last couple of years were lonely and melancholic, as he lived in modest hotels without money and writing in his journal of dreams in which he was allowed to return to Brazil. He never supported a restoration of the monarchy, once stating that he had no desire &quot;to return to the position which I occupied, especially not by means of conspiracy of any sort.&quot; One day he caught an infection that progressed quickly into pneumonia. Pedro rapidly declined and died at 00:35 on 5 December 1891 surrounded by his family. His last words were &quot;May God grant me these last wishes—peace and prosperity for Brazil&quot;. While the body was being prepared, a sealed package in the room was found, and next to it a message written by the Emperor himself: &quot;It is soil from my country, I wish it to be placed in my coffin in case I die away from my fatherland.&quot;

Isabel wished to hold a discreet and private burial ceremony, but she eventually agreed to the French government&#x27;s request for a state funeral. On 9 December, thousands of mourners attended the ceremony at La Madeleine. Aside from Pedro&#x27;s family, these included: Francesco II, former king of the Two Sicilies; Isabel II, former queen of Spain; Philippe, comte de Paris; and other members of European royalty. Also present were General Joseph Brugère, representing President Sadi Carnot; the presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies as well as their members; diplomats; and other representatives of the French government. Nearly all members of the Institut de France were in attendance. Other governments from the Americas and Europe sent representatives, as did the Ottoman Empire, Persia, China, and Japan. Following the services, the coffin was taken in procession to the railway station to begin its trip to Portugal. Around 300,000 people lined the route under incessant rain and cold. The journey continued on to the Church of São Vicente de Fora near Lisbon, where the body of Pedro was interred in the Royal Pantheon of the House of Braganza on 12 December.

The Brazilian republican government, &quot;fearful of a backlash resulting from the death of the Emperor&quot;, banned any official reaction. Nevertheless, Brazilians were not indifferent to Pedro&#x27;s death, and &quot;repercussions in Brazil were also immense, despite the government&#x27;s effort to suppress. There were demonstrations of sorrow throughout the country: shuttered business activity, flags displayed at half-staff, black armbands on clothes, death knells, religious ceremonies.&quot; Masses were held in memory of Pedro throughout Brazil, and he and the monarchy were praised in the eulogies that followed.

=== Legacy ===
After his fall, Brazilians remained attached to the Emperor, who was still a popular and highly praised figure. This view was even stronger among those of African descent, who equated the monarchy with freedom because of his and his daughter Isabel&#x27;s part in the abolition of slavery. The continued support for the deposed monarch is largely credited to a generally held and unextinguished belief that he was a truly &quot;wise, benevolent, austere and honest ruler&quot;, said historian Ricardo Salles. The positive view of Pedro II, and nostalgia for his reign, only grew as the nation quickly fell into a series of economic and political crises which Brazilians attributed to the Emperor&#x27;s overthrow.

Strong feelings of guilt manifested among republicans, and these became increasingly evident upon the Emperor&#x27;s death in exile. They praised Pedro II, who was seen as a model of republican ideals, and the imperial era, which they believed should be regarded as an example to be followed by the young republic. In Brazil, the news of the Emperor&#x27;s death &quot;aroused a genuine sense of regret among those who, without sympathy for a restoration, acknowledged both the merits and the achievements of their deceased ruler.&quot; His remains, as well as those of his wife, were returned to Brazil in 1921 in time for the centenary of the Brazilian independence. The government granted Pedro II dignities befitting a head of state. A national holiday was declared and the return of the Emperor as a national hero was celebrated throughout the country. Thousands attended the main ceremony in Rio de Janeiro where, according to historian Pedro Calmon, the &quot;elderly people cried. Many knelt down. All clapped hands. There was no distinction between republicans and monarchists. They were all Brazilians.&quot; This homage marked the reconciliation of Republican Brazil with its monarchical past.

Historians have expressed high regard for Pedro II and his reign. The scholarly literature dealing with him is vast and, with the exception of the period immediately after his ouster, overwhelmingly positive, and even laudatory. He has been regarded by several historians in Brazil as the greatest Brazilian. In a manner similar to methods which were used by republicans, historians point to the Emperor&#x27;s virtues as an example to be followed, although none go so far as to advocate a restoration of the monarchy. Historian Richard Graham noted that &quot;[m]ost twentieth-century historians, moreover, have looked back on the period [of Pedro II&#x27;s reign] nostalgically, using their descriptions of the Empire to criticize—sometimes subtly, sometimes not—Brazil&#x27;s subsequent republican or dictatorial regimes.&quot;

<text>Ilford is a large town in East London, England, northeast of Charing Cross. Part of the London Borough of Redbridge, Ilford is within the ceremonial county of Greater London. It had a population of 168,168 in 2011, compared to 303,858 for the entire borough.

Identified as a metropolitan centre in the London Plan, Ilford&#x27;s commercial and retail centre is surrounded by extensive residential development. The town is on the transport corridor between London and coastal Essex, with both the A12 and the central railway station linking the regions. In recent years, as a result of increased levels of immigration, Ilford has become one of the most multicultural towns in England.

Historically a small rural settlement in the ancient parish of Barking in the Becontree hundred of the historic county of Essex, its strategic position on the River Roding and the London to Colchester road made it a coaching town. The arrival of the railway in 1839 accelerated its growth, leading to the area becoming part of the conurbation with London. It split from the parish of Barking in 1888, and, in the 20th century, Ilford significantly expanded and increased in population, becoming a municipal borough in 1926. In 1965, it merged with Wanstead and Woodford, also incorporating parts of neighbouring districts, to form the London Borough of Redbridge, part of Greater London.

==Origins and administration==
===Toponymy===
Ilford was historically known as Great Ilford to differentiate it from nearby Little Ilford. The name is first recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Ilefort&quot; and means &quot;ford over the Hyle&quot;. &quot;Hyle&quot; is an old Celtic name for the River Roding that means &quot;trickling stream&quot;. Great and Little Ilford share the place name origin, but the Domesday reference is to the Little Ilford area.

Great and Little Ilford appear to have always been distinct areas separated by the Roding. The place names of Great and Little Ilford both appear to derive from the ford (and river), rather than deriving from the subdivision of a larger Ilford area.

===Manor of Barking===
Barking was a huge Manor (landholding), first mentioned in a charter in 735 AD. The Manor covered the areas now known as Barking, Dagenham and Ilford. The Manor was held by the Nunnery of Barking Abbey.

===Ancient Parish of Barking===
By the late 1100s (the Parishes of England were, with a few exceptions, fixed for around 700 years from the late 12th century onwards) the huge Manor of Barking was served by two Ancient Parishes, Barking (including Ilford) and Dagenham. This reversed the usual situation (for smaller, and even quite large Manors) where a parish would serve one or more manors. As with other manors, the area held by the declined over time, but the parish boundaries based on its former extent remained constant.
The Parish of Barking, in the Becontree hundred of Essex, covered the areas now known as Barking and Ilford. Barking was a large ancient parish of in the Becontree hundred of Essex. It was divided into the wards of Chadwell, Great Ilford, Ripple and Town.

===Ilford separates from Barking===
The Barking parish authorities gradually lost responsibility for a variety of functions during the 19th century; from 1836, for the administration of poor relief, Ilford came within the Romford Poor Law Union and in 1840 the Metropolitan Police District was extended to cover the area. In 1875, the Romford rural sanitary district was created, covering a wide area including Ilford.

In 1888, Ilford and the neighbouring ward of Chadwell to its east were split from Barking and together formed a separate Ilford civil parish and also a new Urban District Council. In 1890, a local board of health was set up for the parish, replacing the rural sanitary authority, and in 1894 a reform of local government reconstituted it as an urban district. It formed part of the London Traffic Area from 1924 and the London Passenger Transport Area from 1933. It was incorporated as the Municipal Borough of Ilford in 1926.

The suburban expansion of London caused a significant increase in population and the borough became one of the largest in England not to gain county borough status.

===London Borough of Redbridge===
In 1965, the municipal borough was abolished and its former area was combined with that of Wanstead and Woodford, the northern extremity of Dagenham and a small part Chigwell Urban District (around Hainault), to form the new London Borough of Redbridge.

===Representation===
Two the UK Parliamentary constituencies are named after Ilford: Ilford North and Ilford South.The Member of Parliament (MP) for Ilford North is Wes Streeting of the Labour Party, who succeeded the previous MP Lee Scott of the Conservative Party in the 2015 general election. The MP for Ilford South from 2024 is Jas Athwal of the Labour Party. Redbridge forms part of the Havering and Redbridge London Assembly constituency.

==History==
===Prehistoric natural history===
The only complete skull of a mammoth discovered in the United Kingdom was unearthed in 1864 close to where Uphall Road is today. The skull can now be seen in the Natural History Museum and a cast of the skull and other prehistoric animal remains can be seen at Redbridge Museum, Central Library, Ilford.

===Iron Age===
Redevelopment has destroyed much of the evidence for early Ilford, but the oldest evidence for human occupation is the first- and second-century BC Iron Age earthwork known as Uphall Camp. This was situated between the Roding and Ilford Lane and is recorded in 18th-century plans. Roman finds have also been made in the vicinity.

===Lavender Mount===
A nearby mound called Lavender Mount existed into the 1960s, when it was removed during building work at Howards chemical works. Excavation has shown that Lavender Mount may have been a 16th-century &#x27;beacon-mound&#x27;. Archaeological discoveries are displayed at Redbridge Museum.

===Economic development===
Ilford straddled the important road from London to Colchester. The Middlesex and Essex Turnpike Trust controlled and maintained the road from 1721. The River Roding was made navigable for barges as far as Ilford Bridge from 1737. Ilford remained largely rural until its expansion in the 19th century. This brought about brickworks, cement works and coal yards to service the new buildings, largely centred on the River Roding. In 1839, a railway station was opened on the line from Romford to Mile End. The early businesses gave way to new industries, such as paper making and services such as steam laundries and collar making, to provide for the new commuting class created by the railway. 

A number of major businesses have been founded in the town, including the eponymous photographic film and chemicals manufacturer Ilford Photo. This was founded in 1879 by Alfred H. Harman, a photographer from Peckham, who established the business in a house in Cranbrook Road making gelatino-bromide &#x27;dry&#x27; plates. The business soon outgrew these premises, and its headquarters moved to a site at Roden Street until 1976 when the factory was closed. Many Ilford Limited products are displayed at Redbridge Museum.

The radio, electronics and telecommunications company Plessey, founded in 1917 in Marylebone, moved to Cottenham Road in Ilford early in 1919 and then to Vicarage Lane where it became one of the largest manufacturers in its field. During World War II, the factory was heavily damaged by bombing and the company carried out much of its manufacture, with 2,000 workers servicing a production line, located in the underground railway tunnel between Wanstead and Gants Hill. In 1955 the company employed 15,000 workers, in sites throughout Ilford and neighbouring areas, with an extensive research department. BAL-AMi Jukeboxes were manufactured at 290–296 High Road, Ilford, during the 1950s, which also served as the headquarters of the Balfour (Marine) Engineering company. The Exchange is the main shopping centre.

===Suburban expansion===

By 1653, Ilford was a compact village of 50 houses, mostly sited north and south of the current Broadway and the area was distinctly rural. In 1801 the population of Ilford was 1,724 and by 1841 it had grown to 3,742. It had a population of 41,244 in 1901 and occupied an area of . 2,500 houses of the vast Becontree Estate, built by the London County Council from 1921, were within the boundaries of Ilford; the addition caused a rise in population of 11,600 by 1926. 

The Central line service of the London Underground to new and former main-line stations in the area began in 1947 and the population of the Municipal Borough of Ilford peaked in 1951 at 184,706, declining to 178,024 in 1961 before being absorbed into Redbridge and Greater London in 1965. At the 2001 Census the combined populations of the Ilford North and Ilford South constituencies was 196,414.

===Notable events===
John Logie Baird, who invented the television, moved to Ilford in the mid to late 1920s to work on his new invention. He worked in a workshop on the roof of the Plessey premises in Ley Street, which has long since been demolished to make way for new housing.

In 1922, Ilford became notorious for being the site of the Thompson-Bywaters case, a &quot;cause celebre&quot; in the United Kingdom that later influenced the debate around capital punishment in the UK.

Ilford was also the birthplace of the actor Maggie Smith who left for Oxford at the age of four.

During World War II an Ilford man lost his life when his Royal Air Force training aircraft crashed in the United States. Local residents living near the site, in the State of Oklahoma, erected a monument in 2000 honouring the lives of all four RAF fliers who perished. The event was attended by the Mayor of Redbridge and his mace-bearer, to much local acclaim. The residents, who include Choctaw Indians and the Choctaw Nation government, continue honouring the lives of all four on each anniversary of the crashes, which took place in February 1943.

===Olympics===
Its proximity to the Olympic Park in Stratford meant that in 2011, Ilford was the fastest-growing tourist destination in Europe due to the London 2012 Summer Olympics.

<doc id="81480" wikidata="Q939" url="?curid=81480" title="Pedro I of Brazil">
<text>&quot;Dom&quot; Pedro I (12 October 1798 – 24 September 1834) was the founder and first ruler of the Empire of Brazil, where he was known as &quot;the Liberator&quot;. As King Dom Pedro IV, he reigned briefly over Portugal, where he also became known as &quot;the Liberator&quot; as well as &quot;the Soldier King&quot;. Born in Lisbon, Pedro I was the fourth child of King Dom John VI of Portugal and Queen Carlota Joaquina, and thus a member of the House of Braganza. When the country was invaded by French troops in 1807, he and his family fled to Portugal&#x27;s largest and wealthiest colony, Brazil.

The outbreak of the Liberal Revolution of 1820 in Lisbon compelled Pedro I&#x27;s father to return to Portugal in April 1821, leaving him to rule Brazil as regent. He had to deal with challenges from revolutionaries and insubordination by Portuguese troops, all of which he subdued. The Portuguese government&#x27;s threat to revoke the political autonomy that Brazil had enjoyed since 1808 was met with widespread discontent in Brazil. Pedro I chose the Brazilian side and declared Brazil&#x27;s independence from Portugal on 7 September 1822. On 12 October, he was acclaimed Brazilian emperor and by March 1824 had defeated all armies loyal to Portugal. A few months later, Pedro I crushed the short-lived Confederation of the Equator, a failed secession attempt by provincial rebels in Brazil&#x27;s northeast.

A secessionist rebellion in the southern province of Cisplatina in early 1825, and the subsequent attempt by the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata to annex it, led the Empire into the Cisplatine War. In March 1826, Pedro I briefly became king of Portugal before abdicating in favor of his eldest daughter, Dona Maria II. The situation worsened in 1828 when the war in the south resulted in Brazil&#x27;s loss of Cisplatina. During the same year in Lisbon, Maria II&#x27;s throne was usurped by Prince Dom Miguel, Pedro I&#x27;s younger brother. The Emperor&#x27;s concurrent and scandalous sexual affair with Domitila de Castro tarnished his reputation. Other difficulties arose in the Brazilian parliament, where a struggle over whether the government would be chosen by the monarch or by the legislature dominated political debates from 1826 to 1831. Unable to deal with problems in both Brazil and Portugal simultaneously, on 7 April 1831 Pedro I abdicated in favor of his son Dom Pedro II, and sailed for Europe.

Pedro I invaded Portugal at the head of an army in July 1832. Faced at first with what seemed a national civil war, he soon became involved in a wider conflict that enveloped the Iberian Peninsula in a struggle between proponents of liberalism and those seeking a return to absolutism. Pedro I died of tuberculosis in September 1834, just a few months after he and the liberals had emerged victorious. He was hailed by both contemporaries and posterity as a key figure who helped spread the liberal ideals that allowed Brazil and Portugal to move from absolutist regimes to representative forms of government.

== Early years ==

=== Birth ===

Pedro was born at 08:00 on 12 October 1798 in the Queluz Royal Palace near Lisbon, Portugal. He was named after St. Peter of Alcantara, and his full name was Pedro de Alcântara Francisco António João Carlos Xavier de Paula Miguel Rafael Joaquim José Gonzaga Pascoal Cipriano Serafim. He was referred to using the honorific &quot;Dom&quot; (Lord) from birth.

Through his father, Prince Dom John (later King Dom John VI), Pedro was a member of the House of Braganza (Portuguese: &quot;Bragança&quot;) and a grandson of King Dom Peter III and Queen Dona (Lady) Maria I of Portugal, who were uncle and niece as well as husband and wife. His mother, Doña Carlota Joaquina, was the daughter of King Don Charles IV of Spain. Pedro&#x27;s parents had an unhappy marriage. Carlota Joaquina was an ambitious woman, who always sought to advance Spain&#x27;s interests, even to the detriment of Portugal&#x27;s. Reputedly unfaithful to her husband, she went as far as to plot his overthrow in league with dissatisfied Portuguese nobles.

As the second eldest son (though the fourth child), Pedro became his father&#x27;s heir apparent and Prince of Beira upon the death of his elder brother Francisco António in 1801. Prince Dom John had been acting as regent on behalf of his mother, Queen Maria I, after she was declared incurably insane in 1792. By 1802, Pedro&#x27;s parents were estranged; John lived in the Mafra National Palace and Carlota Joaquina in Ramalhão Palace. Pedro and his siblings resided in the Queluz Palace with their grandmother Maria I, far from their parents, whom they saw only during state occasions at Queluz.

=== Education ===

In late November 1807, when Pedro was nine, the royal family escaped from Portugal as an invading French army sent by Napoleon approached Lisbon. Pedro and his family arrived in Rio de Janeiro, then capital of Brazil, Portugal&#x27;s largest and wealthiest colony, in March 1808. During the voyage, Pedro read Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; and conversed with the ship&#x27;s crew, picking up navigational skills. In Brazil, after a brief stay in the City Palace, Pedro settled with his younger brother Miguel and their father in the Palace of São Cristóvão (Saint Christopher). Although never on intimate terms with his father, Pedro loved him and resented the constant humiliation his father suffered at the hands of Carlota Joaquina due to her extramarital affairs. As an adult, Pedro would openly call his mother, for whom he held only feelings of contempt, a &quot;bitch&quot;. The early experiences of betrayal, coldness and neglect had a great impact on the formation of Pedro&#x27;s character.

A modicum of stability during his childhood was provided by his &quot;aia&quot; (governess), Maria Genoveva do Rêgo e Matos, whom he loved as a mother, and by his &quot;aio&quot; (supervisor) friar António de Arrábida, who became his mentor. Both were in charge of Pedro&#x27;s upbringing and attempted to furnish him with a suitable education. His instruction encompassed a broad array of subjects that included mathematics, political economy, logic, history and geography. He learned to speak and write not only in Portuguese, but also Latin and French. He could translate from English and understood German. Even later on, as an emperor, Pedro would devote at least two hours of each day to study and reading.

Despite the breadth of Pedro&#x27;s instruction, his education proved lacking. Historian Octávio Tarquínio de Sousa said that Pedro &quot;was without a shadow of doubt intelligent, quick-witted, [and] perspicacious.&quot; However, historian Roderick J. Barman relates that he was by nature &quot;too ebullient, too erratic, and too emotional&quot;. He remained impulsive and never learned to exercise self-control or to assess the consequences of his decisions and adapt his outlook to changes in situations. His father never allowed anyone to discipline him. While Pedro&#x27;s schedule dictated two hours of study each day, he sometimes circumvented the routine by dismissing his instructors in favor of activities that he found more interesting.

=== First marriage ===

The prince found fulfillment in activities that required physical skills, rather than in the classroom. At his father&#x27;s Santa Cruz farm, Pedro trained unbroken horses, and became a fine horseman and an excellent farrier. He and his brother Miguel enjoyed mounted hunts over unfamiliar ground, through forests, and even at night or in inclement weather. He displayed a talent for drawing and handicrafts, applying himself to wood carving and furniture making. In addition, he had a taste for music, and under the guidance of Marcos Portugal the prince became an able composer (later creating Brazil&#x27;s Independence Anthem). He had a good singing voice, and was proficient with several musical instruments (including piano, flute and guitar), playing popular songs and dances. Pedro was a simple man, both in habits and in dealing with others. Except on solemn occasions when he donned court dress, his daily attire consisted of white cotton trousers, striped cotton jacket and a broad-brimmed straw hat, or a frock coat and a top hat in more formal situations. He would frequently take time to engage in conversation with people on the street, noting their concerns.

Pedro&#x27;s character was marked by an energetic drive that bordered on hyperactivity. He was impetuous with a tendency to be domineering and short-tempered. Easily bored or distracted, he entertained himself with dalliances with women in addition to his hunting and equestrian activities. His restless spirit compelled him to search for adventure, and, sometimes in disguise as a traveler, he frequented taverns in Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s disreputable districts. He rarely drank alcohol, but was an incorrigible womanizer. His earliest known lasting affair was with a French dancer called Noémi Thierry, who had a stillborn child by him. Pedro&#x27;s father, who had ascended the throne as John VI, sent Thierry away to avoid jeopardizing the prince&#x27;s betrothal to Archduchess Maria Leopoldina, daughter of Emperor Francis I of Austria (formerly Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor).

On 13 May 1817, Pedro was married by proxy to Maria Leopoldina. When she arrived in Rio de Janeiro on 5 November, she immediately fell in love with Pedro, who was far more charming and attractive than she had been led to expect. After &quot;years under a tropical sun, his complexion was still light, his cheeks rosy.&quot; The 19-year-old prince was handsome and a little above average in height, with bright dark eyes and dark brown hair. &quot;His good appearance&quot;, said historian Neill Macaulay, &quot;owed much to his bearing, proud and erect even at an awkward age, and his grooming, which was impeccable. Habitually neat and clean, he had taken to the Brazilian custom of bathing often.&quot; The Nuptial Mass, with the ratification of the vows previously taken by proxy, occurred the following day. Seven children resulted from this marriage: Maria (later Queen Dona Maria II of Portugal), Miguel, João, Januária, Paula, Francisca and Pedro (later Emperor Dom Pedro II of Brazil).

== Independence of Brazil ==
=== Liberal Revolution of 1820 ===
On 17 October 1820, news arrived that the military garrisons in Portugal had mutinied, leading to what became known as the Liberal Revolution of 1820. The military formed a provisional government, supplanting the regency appointed by John VI, and summoned the &quot;Cortes&quot;—the centuries-old Portuguese parliament, this time democratically elected with the aim of creating a national Constitution. Pedro was surprised when his father not only asked for his advice, but also decided to send him to Portugal to rule as regent on his behalf and to placate the revolutionaries. The prince was never educated to rule and had previously been allowed no participation in state affairs. The role that was his by birthright was instead filled by his elder sister Dona Maria Teresa: John VI had relied on her for advice, and it was she who had been given membership in the Council of State.

Pedro was regarded with suspicion by his father and by the king&#x27;s close advisers, all of whom clung to the principles of absolute monarchy. By contrast, the prince was a well-known, staunch supporter of liberalism and of constitutional representative monarchy. He had read the works of Voltaire, Benjamin Constant, Gaetano Filangieri and Edmund Burke. Even his wife Maria Leopoldina remarked, &quot;My husband, God help us, loves the new ideas.&quot; John VI postponed Pedro&#x27;s departure for as long as possible, fearing that once he was in Portugal, he would be acclaimed king by the revolutionaries.

On 26 February 1821, Portuguese troops stationed in Rio de Janeiro mutinied. Neither John VI nor his government made any move against the mutinous units. Pedro decided to act on his own and rode to meet the rebels. He negotiated with them and convinced his father to accept their demands, which included naming a new cabinet and making an oath of obedience to the forthcoming Portuguese Constitution. On 21 April, the parish electors of Rio de Janeiro met at the Merchants&#x27; Exchange to elect their representatives to the &quot;Cortes&quot;. A small group of agitators seized the meeting and formed a revolutionary government. Again, John VI and his ministers remained passive, and the monarch was about to accept the revolutionaries&#x27; demands when Pedro took the initiative and sent army troops to re-establish order. Under pressure from the &quot;Cortes&quot;, John VI and his family departed for Portugal on 26 April, leaving behind Pedro and Maria Leopoldina. Two days before he embarked, the King warned his son: &quot;Pedro, if Brazil breaks away, let it rather do so for you, who will respect me, than for one of those adventurers.&quot;

=== Independence or Death ===

At the outset of his regency, Pedro promulgated decrees that guaranteed personal and property rights. He also reduced government expenditure and taxes. Even the revolutionaries arrested in the Merchants&#x27; Exchange incident were set free. On 5 June 1821, army troops under Portuguese lieutenant general Jorge Avilez (later Count of Avilez) mutinied, demanding that Pedro should take an oath to uphold the Portuguese Constitution after it was enacted. The prince rode out alone to intervene with the mutineers. He calmly and resourcefully negotiated, winning the respect of the troops and succeeding in reducing the impact of their more unacceptable demands. The mutiny was a thinly veiled military coup d&#x27;état that sought to turn Pedro into a mere figurehead and transfer power to Avilez. The prince accepted the unsatisfactory outcome, but he also warned that it was the last time he would yield under pressure.

The continuing crisis reached a point of no return when the &quot;Cortes&quot; dissolved the central government in Rio de Janeiro and ordered Pedro&#x27;s return. This was perceived by Brazilians as an attempt to subordinate their country again to Portugal—Brazil had not been a colony since 1815 and had the status of a kingdom. On 9 January 1822, Pedro was presented with a petition containing 8,000 signatures that begged him not to leave. He replied, &quot;Since it is for the good of all and the general happiness of the Nation, I am willing. Tell the people that I am staying.&quot; The date became known as the &quot;Dia do Fico&quot;. Avilez again mutinied and tried to force Pedro&#x27;s return to Portugal. This time the prince fought back, rallying the Brazilian troops (which had not joined the Portuguese in previous mutinies), militia units and armed civilians. Outnumbered, Avilez surrendered and was expelled from Brazil along with his troops.

During the next few months, Pedro attempted to maintain a semblance of unity with Portugal, but the final rupture was impending. Aided by an able minister, José Bonifácio de Andrada, he searched for support outside Rio de Janeiro. The prince traveled to Minas Gerais in April and on to São Paulo in August. He was welcomed warmly in both Brazilian provinces, and the visits reinforced his authority. While returning from São Paulo, he received news sent on 7 September that the &quot;Cortes&quot; would not accept self-governance in Brazil and would punish all who disobeyed its orders. &quot;Never one to eschew the most dramatic action on the immediate impulse&quot;, said Barman about the prince, he &quot;required no more time for decision than the reading of the letters demanded.&quot; Pedro mounted his bay mare and, in front of his entourage and his Guard of Honor, said: &quot;Friends, the Portuguese &quot;Cortes&quot; wished to enslave and persecute us. As of today our bonds are ended. By my blood, by my honor, by my God, I swear to bring about the independence of Brazil. Brazilians, let our watchword from this day forth be &#x27;Independence or Death!

=== Constitutional Emperor ===

The prince was acclaimed Emperor Dom Pedro I on his 24th birthday, which coincided with the inauguration of the Empire of Brazil on 12 October. He was crowned on 1 December in what is today known as the Old Cathedral of Rio de Janeiro. His ascendancy did not immediately extend throughout Brazil&#x27;s territories. He had to force the submission of several provinces in the northern, northeastern and southern regions, and the last Portuguese holdout units only surrendered in early 1824. Meanwhile, Pedro I&#x27;s relationship with Bonifácio deteriorated. The situation came to a head when Pedro I, on the grounds of inappropriate conduct, dismissed Bonifácio. Bonifácio had used his position to harass, prosecute, arrest and even exile his political enemies. For months Bonifácio&#x27;s enemies had worked to win over the Emperor. While Pedro I was still Prince Regent, they had given him the title &quot;Perpetual Defender of Brazil&quot; on 13 May 1822. They also inducted him into Freemasonry on 2 August and later made him grand master on 7 October, replacing Bonifácio in that position.

The crisis between the monarch and his former minister was felt immediately within the Constituent and Legislative General Assembly, which had been elected for the purpose of drafting a Constitution. A member of the Constituent Assembly, Bonifácio resorted to demagoguery, alleging the existence of a major Portuguese conspiracy against Brazilian interests—insinuating that Pedro I, who had been born in Portugal, was implicated. The Emperor became outraged by the invective directed at the loyalty of citizens who were of Portuguese birth and the hints that he was himself conflicted in his allegiance to Brazil. On 12 November 1823, Pedro I ordered the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly and called for new elections. On the following day, he placed a newly established native Council of State in charge of composing a constitutional draft. Copies of the draft were sent to all town councils, and the vast majority voted in favor of its instant adoption as the Constitution of the Empire.

As a result of the highly centralized State created by the Constitution, rebellious elements in Ceará, Paraíba and Pernambuco attempted to secede from Brazil and unite in what became known as the Confederation of the Equator. Pedro I unsuccessfully sought to avoid bloodshed by offering to placate the rebels. Angry, he said: &quot;What did the insults from Pernambuco require? Surely a punishment, and such a punishment that it will serve as an example for the future.&quot; The rebels were never able to secure control over their provinces, and were easily suppressed. By late 1824, the rebellion was over. Sixteen rebels were tried and executed, while all others were pardoned by the Emperor.

== Crises within and without ==

=== Portuguese dynastic affair ===

After long negotiations, Portugal signed a treaty with Brazil on 29 August 1825 in which it recognized Brazilian independence. Except for the recognition of independence, the treaty provisions were at Brazil&#x27;s expense, including a demand for reparations to be paid to Portugal, with no other requirements of Portugal. Compensation was to be paid to all Portuguese citizens residing in Brazil for the losses they had experienced, such as properties which had been confiscated. John VI was also given the right to style himself emperor of Brazil. More humiliating was that the treaty implied that independence had been granted as a beneficent act of John VI, rather than having been compelled by the Brazilians through force of arms. Even worse, Great Britain was rewarded for its role in advancing the negotiations by the signing of a separate treaty in which its favorable commercial rights were renewed and by the signing of a convention in which Brazil agreed to abolish slave trade with Africa within four years. Both accords were severely harmful to Brazilian economic interests.

A few months later, the Emperor received word that his father had died on 10 March 1826, and that he had succeeded his father on the Portuguese throne as King Dom Pedro IV. Aware that a reunion of Brazil and Portugal would be unacceptable to the people of both nations, he hastily abdicated the crown of Portugal on 2 May in favor of his eldest daughter, who became Queen Dona Maria II. His abdication was conditional: Portugal was required to accept the Constitution which he had drafted and Maria II was to marry his brother Miguel. Regardless of the abdication, Pedro I continued to act as an absentee king of Portugal and interceded in its diplomatic matters, as well as in internal affairs, such as making appointments. He found it difficult, at the very least, to keep his position as Brazilian emperor separate from his obligations to protect his daughter&#x27;s interests in Portugal.

Miguel feigned compliance with Pedro I&#x27;s plans. As soon as he was declared regent in early 1828, and backed by Carlota Joaquina, he abrogated the Constitution and, supported by those Portuguese in favor of absolutism, was acclaimed King Dom Miguel I. As painful as was his beloved brother&#x27;s betrayal, Pedro I also endured the defection of his surviving sisters, Maria Teresa, Maria Francisca, Isabel Maria and Maria da Assunção, to Miguel I&#x27;s faction. Only his youngest sister, Ana de Jesus, remained faithful to him, and she later traveled to Rio de Janeiro to be close to him. Consumed by hatred and beginning to believe rumors that Miguel I had murdered their father, Pedro I turned his focus on Portugal and tried in vain to garner international support for Maria II&#x27;s rights.

=== War and widowhood ===

Backed by the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata (present-day Argentina), a small band declared Brazil&#x27;s southernmost province of Cisplatina to be independent in April 1825. The Brazilian government at first perceived the secession attempt as a minor uprising. It took months before a greater threat posed by the involvement of the United Provinces, which expected to annex Cisplatina, caused serious concern. In retaliation, the Empire declared war in December, triggering the Cisplatine War. The Emperor traveled to Bahia province (located in northeastern Brazil) in February 1826, taking along his wife and daughter Maria. The Emperor was warmly welcomed by the inhabitants of Bahia. The trip was planned to generate support for the war-effort.

The imperial entourage included Domitila de Castro (then-Viscountess and later Marchioness of Santos), who had been Pedro I&#x27;s mistress since their first meeting in 1822. Although he had never been faithful to Maria Leopoldina, he had previously been careful to conceal his sexual escapades with other women. However, his infatuation for his new lover &quot;had become both blatant and limitless&quot;, while his wife endured slights and became the object of gossip. Pedro I was increasingly rude and mean toward Maria Leopoldina, left her short of funds, prohibited her from leaving the palace and forced her to endure Domitila&#x27;s presence as her lady-in-waiting. In the meantime, his lover took advantage by advancing her interests, as well as those of her family and friends. Those seeking favors or to promote projects increasingly sought her help, bypassing the normal, legal channels.

On 24 November 1826, Pedro I sailed from Rio de Janeiro to São José in the province of Santa Catarina. From there he rode to Porto Alegre, capital of the province of Rio Grande do Sul, where the main army was stationed. Upon his arrival on 7 December, the Emperor found the military conditions to be much worse than previous reports had led him to expect. He &quot;reacted with his customary energy: he passed a flurry of orders, fired reputed grafters and incompetents, fraternized with the troops, and generally shook up military and civilian administration.&quot; He was already on his way back to Rio de Janeiro when he was told that Maria Leopoldina had died following a miscarriage. Unfounded rumors soon spread that purported that she had died after being physically assaulted by Pedro I. Meanwhile, the war continued on with no conclusion in sight. Pedro I relinquished Cisplatina in August 1828, and the province became the independent nation of Uruguay.

=== Second marriage ===

After his wife&#x27;s death, Pedro I realized how miserably he had treated her, and his relationship with Domitila began to crumble. Maria Leopoldina, unlike his mistress, was popular, honest and loved him without expecting anything in return. The Emperor greatly missed her, and even his obsession with Domitila failed to overcome his sense of loss and regret. One day Domitila found him weeping on the floor and embracing a portrait of his deceased wife, whose sad-looking ghost Pedro I claimed to have seen. Later on, the Emperor left the bed he shared with Domitila and shouted: &quot;Get off of me! I know I live an unworthy life of a sovereign. The thought of the Empress does not leave me.&quot; He did not forget his children, orphaned of their mother, and was observed on more than one occasion holding his son, the young Pedro, in his arms and saying: &quot;Poor boy, you are the most unhappy prince in the world.&quot;

At the insistence of Pedro I, Domitila departed from Rio de Janeiro on 27 June 1828. He had resolved to marry again and to become a better person. He even tried to persuade his father-in-law of his sincerity, by claiming in a letter &quot;that all my wickedness is over, that I shall not again fall into those errors into which I have fallen, which I regret and have asked God for forgiveness&quot;. Francis I was less than convinced. The Austrian emperor, deeply offended by the conduct his daughter endured, withdrew his support for Brazilian concerns and frustrated Pedro I&#x27;s Portuguese interests. Because of Pedro I&#x27;s bad reputation in Europe, owing to his past behavior, princesses from several nations declined his proposals of marriage one after another. His pride thus wounded, he allowed his mistress to return, which she did on 29 April 1829 after having been away nearly a year.

However, once he learned that a betrothal had finally been arranged, the Emperor ended his relationship to Domitila. She returned to her native province of São Paulo on 27 August, where she remained. Days earlier, on 2 August, the Emperor had been married by proxy to Amélie of Leuchtenberg. He was stunned by her beauty after meeting her in person. The vows previously made by proxy were ratified in a Nuptial Mass on 17 October. Amélie was kind and loving to his children and provided a much needed sense of normality to both his family and the general public. After Domitila&#x27;s banishment from court, the vow the Emperor made to alter his behavior proved to be sincere. He had no more affairs and remained faithful to his spouse. In an attempt to mitigate and move beyond other past misdeeds, he made peace with José Bonifácio, his former minister and mentor.

== Between Portugal and Brazil ==

=== Endless crises ===

Since the days of the Constituent Assembly in 1823, and with renewed vigor in 1826 with the opening of the General Assembly (the Brazilian parliament), there had been an ideological struggle over the balance of powers wielded by the emperor and legislature in governance. On one side were those who shared Pedro I&#x27;s views, politicians who believed that the monarch should be free to choose ministers, national policies and the direction of government. In opposition were those, then known as the Liberal Party, who believed that cabinets should have the power to set the government&#x27;s course and should consist of deputies drawn from the majority party who were accountable to the parliament. Strictly speaking, both the party that supported Pedro I&#x27;s government and the Liberal Party advocated Liberalism, and thus constitutional monarchy.

Regardless of Pedro I&#x27;s failures as a ruler, he respected the Constitution: he did not tamper with elections or countenance vote rigging, refuse to sign acts ratified by the government, or impose any restrictions on freedom of speech. Although within his prerogative, he did not dissolve the Chamber of Deputies and call for new elections when it disagreed with his aims or postpone seating the legislature. Liberal newspapers and pamphlets seized on Pedro I&#x27;s Portuguese birth in support of both valid accusations (e.g., that much of his energy was directed toward affairs concerning Portugal) and false charges (e.g., that he was involved in plots to suppress the Constitution and to reunite Brazil and Portugal). To the Liberals, the Emperor&#x27;s Portuguese-born friends who were part of the Imperial court, including Francisco Gomes da Silva who was nicknamed &quot;the Buffoon&quot;, were part of these conspiracies and formed a &quot;secret cabinet&quot;. None of these figures exhibited interest in such issues, and whatever interests they may have shared, there was no palace cabal plotting to abrogate the Constitution or to bring Brazil back under Portugal&#x27;s control.

Another source of criticism by the Liberals involved Pedro I&#x27;s abolitionist views. The Emperor had indeed conceived a gradual process for eliminating slavery. However, the constitutional power to enact legislation was in the hands of the Assembly, which was dominated by slave-owning landholders who could thus thwart any attempt at abolition. The Emperor opted to try persuasion by moral example, setting up his estate at Santa Cruz as a model by granting land to his freed slaves there. Pedro I also professed other advanced ideas. When he declared his intention to remain in Brazil on 9 January 1822 and the populace sought to accord him the honor of unhitching the horses and pulling his carriage themselves, the then-Prince Regent refused. His reply was a simultaneous denunciation of the divine right of kings, of nobility&#x27;s supposedly superior blood and of racism: &quot;It grieves me to see my fellow humans giving a man tributes appropriate for the divinity, I know that my blood is the same color as that of the Negroes.&quot;

=== Abdication ===
The Emperor&#x27;s efforts to appease the Liberal Party resulted in very important changes. He supported an 1827 law that established ministerial responsibility. On 19 March 1831, he named a cabinet formed by politicians drawn from the opposition, allowing a greater role for the parliament in the government. Lastly, he offered positions in Europe to Francisco Gomes and another Portuguese-born friend to extinguish rumors of a &quot;secret cabinet&quot;. To his dismay, his palliative measures did not stop the continuous attacks from the Liberal side upon his government and his foreign birth. Frustrated by their intransigence, he became unwilling to deal with his deteriorating political situation.

Meanwhile, Portuguese exiles campaigned to convince him to give up on Brazil and instead devote his energies to the fight for his daughter&#x27;s claim to Portugal&#x27;s crown. According to Roderick J. Barman, &quot;[in] an emergency the Emperor&#x27;s abilities shone forth—he became cool in nerve, resourceful and steadfast in action. Life as a constitutional monarch, full of tedium, caution, and conciliation, ran against the essence of his character.&quot; On the other hand, the historian remarked, he &quot;found in his daughter&#x27;s case everything that appealed most to his character. By going to Portugal he could champion the oppressed, display his chivalry and self-denial, uphold constitutional rule, and enjoy the freedom of action he craved.&quot;

The idea of abdicating and returning to Portugal took root in his mind, and, beginning in early 1829, he talked about it frequently. An opportunity soon appeared to act upon the notion. Radicals within the Liberal Party rallied street gangs to harass the Portuguese community in Rio de Janeiro. On 11 March 1831, in what became known as the Night of the Bottle Fight (), the Portuguese retaliated and turmoil gripped the streets of the national capital. On 5 April, Pedro I fired the Liberal cabinet, which had only been in power since 19 March, for its incompetence in restoring order. A large crowd, incited by the radicals, gathered in Rio de Janeiro downtown on the afternoon of 6 April and demanded the immediate restoration of the fallen cabinet. The Emperor&#x27;s reply was: &quot;I will do everything for the people and nothing [compelled] by the people.&quot; Sometime after nightfall, army troops, including his guard, deserted him and joined the protests. Only then did he realize how isolated and detached from Brazilian affairs he had become, and to everyone&#x27;s surprise, he abdicated at approximately 03:00 on 7 April. Upon delivering the abdication document to a messenger, he said: &quot;Here you have my act of abdication, I&#x27;m returning to Europe and leaving a country that I loved very much, and still love.&quot;

== Return to Europe ==

=== Portuguese Civil War ===
At dawn on the morning of 7 April, Pedro, his wife, and others, including his daughter Maria II and his sister Ana de Jesus, were taken on board the British warship HMS &quot;Warspite&quot;. The vessel remained at anchor off Rio de Janeiro, and, on 13 April, the former emperor transferred to and departed for Europe aboard HMS &quot;Volage&quot;. He arrived in Cherbourg-Octeville, France, on 10 June. During the next few months, he shuttled between France and Great Britain. He was warmly welcomed, but received no actual support from either government to restore his daughter&#x27;s throne. Finding himself in an awkward situation because he held no official status in either the Brazilian Imperial House or in the Portuguese Royal House, Pedro assumed the title of Duke of Braganza on 15 June, a position that once had been his as heir-apparent to Portugal&#x27;s crown. Although the title should have belonged to Maria II&#x27;s heir-apparent, which he certainly was not, his claim was met with general recognition. On 1 December, his only daughter by Amélie, Maria Amélia, was born in Paris.

He did not forget his children left in Brazil. He wrote poignant letters to each of them, conveying how greatly he missed them and repeatedly asking them to seriously attend to their educations. Shortly before his abdication, Pedro had told his son and successor: &quot;I intend that my brother Miguel and I will be the last badly educated of the Braganza family&quot;. Charles Napier, a naval commander who fought under Pedro&#x27;s banner in the 1830s, remarked that &quot;his good qualities were his own; his bad owing to want of education; and no man was more sensible of that defect than himself.&quot; His letters to Pedro II were often couched in language beyond the boy&#x27;s reading level, and historians have assumed such passages were chiefly intended as advice that the young monarch might eventually consult upon reaching adulthood.

While in Paris, the Duke of Braganza met and befriended Gilbert du Motier, Marquis of Lafayette, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War who became one of his staunchest supporters. With limited funds, Pedro organized a small army composed of Portuguese liberals, like Almeida Garrett and Alexandre Herculano, foreign mercenaries and volunteers such as Lafayette&#x27;s grandson, Adrien Jules de Lasteyrie. On 25 January 1832, Pedro bade farewell to his family, Lafayette and around two hundred well-wishers. He knelt before Maria II and said: &quot;My lady, here is a Portuguese general who will uphold your rights and restore your crown.&quot; In tears, his daughter embraced him. Pedro and his army sailed to the Atlantic archipelago of the Azores, the only Portuguese territory that had remained loyal to his daughter. After a few months of final preparations they embarked for mainland Portugal, entering the city of Porto unopposed on 9 July. His brother&#x27;s troops moved to encircle the city, beginning a siege that lasted for more than a year.

=== Death ===
In early 1833, while besieged in Porto, Pedro received news from Brazil of his daughter Paula&#x27;s impending death. Months later, in September, he met with Antônio Carlos de Andrada, a brother of Bonifácio who had come from Brazil. As a representative of the Restorationist Party, Antônio Carlos asked the Duke of Braganza to return to Brazil and rule his former empire as regent during his son&#x27;s minority. Pedro realized that the Restorationists wanted to use him as a tool to facilitate their own rise to power, and frustrated Antônio Carlos by making several demands, to ascertain whether the Brazilian people, and not merely a faction, truly wanted him back. He insisted that any request to return as regent be constitutionally valid. The people&#x27;s will would have to be conveyed through their local representatives and his appointment approved by the General Assembly. Only then, and &quot;upon the presentation of a petition to him in Portugal by an official delegation of the Brazilian parliament&quot; would he consider accepting.

During the war, the Duke of Braganza mounted cannons, dug trenches, tended the wounded, ate among the rank and file and fought under heavy fire as men next to him were shot or blown to pieces. His cause was nearly lost until he took the risky step of dividing his forces and sending a portion to launch an amphibious attack on southern Portugal. The Algarve region fell to the expedition, which then marched north straight for Lisbon, which capitulated on 24 July. Pedro proceeded to subdue the remainder of the country, but just when the conflict looked to be winding down to a conclusion, his Spanish uncle Don Carlos, who was attempting to seize the crown of his niece Doña Isabella II, intervened. In this wider conflict that engulfed the entire Iberian Peninsula, the First Carlist War, the Duke of Braganza allied with liberal Spanish armies loyal to Isabella II and defeated both Miguel I and Carlos. A peace accord was reached on 26 May 1834.

Except for bouts of epilepsy that manifested in seizures every few years, Pedro had always enjoyed robust health. The war, however, undermined his constitution and by 1834 he was dying of tuberculosis. He was confined to his bed in Queluz Royal Palace from 10 September. Pedro dictated an open letter to the Brazilians, in which he begged that a gradual abolition of slavery be adopted. He warned them: &quot;Slavery is an evil, and an attack against the rights and dignity of the human species, but its consequences are less harmful to those who suffer in captivity than to the Nation whose laws allow slavery. It is a cancer that devours its morality.&quot; After a long and painful illness, Pedro died at 14:30 on 24 September 1834. As he had requested, his heart was placed in Porto&#x27;s Lapa Church and his body was interred in the Royal Pantheon of the House of Braganza. The news of his death arrived in Rio de Janeiro on 20 November, but his children were informed only after 2 December. Bonifácio, who had been removed from his position as their guardian, wrote to Pedro II and his sisters: &quot;Dom Pedro did not die. Only ordinary men die, not heroes.&quot;

Upon the death of Pedro I, the then-powerful Restorationist Party vanished overnight. A fair assessment of the former monarch became possible once the threat of his return to power was removed. Evaristo da Veiga, one of his worst critics as well as a leader in the Liberal Party, left a statement which, according to historian Octávio Tarquínio de Sousa, became the prevailing view thereafter: &quot;the former emperor of Brazil was not a prince of ordinary measure ... and Providence has made him a powerful instrument of liberation, both in Brazil and in Portugal. If we [Brazilians] exist as a body in a free Nation, if our land was not ripped apart into small enemy republics, where only anarchy and military spirit predominated, we owe much to the resolution he took in remaining among us, in making the first shout for our Independence.&quot; He continued: &quot;Portugal, if it was freed from the darkest and demeaning tyranny ... if it enjoys the benefits brought by representative government to learned peoples, it owes it to D[om]. Pedro de Alcântara, whose fatigues, sufferings and sacrifices for the Portuguese cause has earned him in high degree the tribute of national gratitude.&quot;

John Armitage, who lived in Brazil during the latter half of Pedro I&#x27;s reign, remarked that &quot;even the errors of the Monarch have been attended with great benefit through their influence on the affairs of the mother country. Had he governed with more wisdom it would have been well for the land of his adoption, yet, perhaps, unfortunate for humanity.&quot; Armitage added that like &quot;the late Emperor of the French, he was also a child of destiny, or rather, an instrument in the hands of an all-seeing and beneficent Providence for the furtherance of great and inscrutable ends. In the old as in the new world he was henceforth fated to become the instrument of further revolutions, and ere the close of his brilliant but ephemeral career in the land of his fathers, to atone amply for the errors and follies of his former life, by his chivalrous and heroic devotion in the cause of civil and religious freedom.&quot;

In 1972, on the 150th anniversary of Brazilian independence, Pedro I&#x27;s remains (though not his heart) were brought to Brazil—as he had requested in his will—accompanied by much fanfare and with honors due to a head of state. His remains were reinterred in the Monument to the Independence of Brazil, along with those of Maria Leopoldina and Amélie, in the city of São Paulo. Years later, Neill Macaulay said that &quot;[c]riticism of Dom Pedro was freely expressed and often vehement; it prompted him to abdicate two thrones. His tolerance of public criticism and his willingness to relinquish power set Dom Pedro apart from his absolutist predecessors and from the rulers of today&#x27;s coercive states, whose lifetime tenure is as secure as that of the kings of old.&quot; Macaulay affirmed that &quot;[s]uccessful liberal leaders like Dom Pedro may be honored with an occasional stone or bronze monument, but their portraits, four stories high, do not shape public buildings; their pictures are not borne in parades of hundreds of thousands of uniformed marchers; no &#x27;-isms&#x27; attach to their names.&quot;

As part of Brazil&#x27;s 200-year independence celebrations in 2022, the embalmed heart of Pedro I received military honors upon arrival in Brasília and was put on public display at the foreign ministry. It was then returned to Portugal after Brazil&#x27;s independence day.

<doc id="81493" wikidata="Q845864" url="?curid=81493" title="Bowser">
<text>, also known as King Bowser or King Koopa, is a fictional character and the main antagonist of Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Mario&quot; franchise. In Japan, he is titled . He is the arch-nemesis of the plumber Mario and the leader of the turtle-like Koopa race. Depicted as a fire-breathing monster with a tyrannical personality, Bowser&#x27;s ultimate goals are to kidnap Princess Peach and conquer the Mushroom Kingdom.

Bowser debuted as Mario&#x27;s opponent in the 1985 video game &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; Designer Shigeru Miyamoto initially conceived him as an ox based on the Ox-King from the Toei Animation film &quot;Alakazam the Great&quot;. However, Takashi Tezuka remarked that the character resembled a turtle more than an ox, leading them to redesign Bowser as the leader of the turtle-like Koopas. Since 2007, Bowser has been voiced by Kenneth W. James.

Following &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, Bowser has appeared in various genres, including role-playing games like &quot;Paper Mario&quot; and &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi&quot;, sports games such as &quot;Mario Kart&quot; and &quot;Mario Tennis&quot;, and fighting games like &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; He has appeared in multiple animations, including three series produced by DIC Entertainment (voiced by Harvey Atkin) and was portrayed by Dennis Hopper in the 1993 &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; film. Jack Black voiced him in &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot; (2023).

Bowser has received a mostly positive reception, with critics noting that he is one of the most iconic and recognizable video game villains. He was crowned the greatest video game villain of all time by the &quot;Guinness World Records Gamer&#x27;s Edition&quot;.

==Development==

Bowser was created by Nintendo designer and producer Shigeru Miyamoto. Miyamoto had first envisioned Bowser as an ox, based on the ox-like King Gruesome from the Toei Animation film &quot;Alakazam the Great&quot;. However, Nintendo designer Takashi Tezuka pointed out that the character looked a lot more like a turtle than an ox. Miyamoto and Tezuka then began to redesign his look to reflect a leader of the turtle-like Koopa Troopas. In his final design, Miyamoto commented that he could make Bowser &quot;look cool now&quot;. During the development of &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, Miyamoto contemplated commissioning the game&#x27;s art to a manga artist or illustrator. However, due to a lack of time, he created the game&#x27;s original box art himself. Bowser is depicted in this artwork in a way that differs from later renditions, with the most noticeable differences being his gray-blue complexion and lack of horns. Miyamoto received inspiration for the character&#x27;s appearance from an anime film version of the Chinese novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, which was renamed &quot;Alakazam the Great&quot; during the film&#x27;s Ameri period. Yōichi Kotabe based Bowser&#x27;s final design on the Chinese softshell turtle, which he recognized as highly aggressive, reflecting Bowser&#x27;s short temper.

Bowser&#x27;s original working name was &quot;Boss Creeper&quot; ( &quot;Bosu Kurīpā&quot;), after the Shellcreepers, the predecessors to the Koopa race, from &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; Miyamoto then named him &quot;Daimaō Kuppa&quot;. &quot;Kuppa&quot; came from the Japanese name for , &quot;gukbap&quot;, a Korean dish. Miyamoto had also considered the names &quot;Yukke&quot; and &quot;Bibinba&quot;, also Japanese names of Korean dishes ( &quot;yukhoe&quot; and &quot;bibimbap&quot; respectively). For the later North American release of the game, which also introduced the anglicized spelling &quot;Koopa&quot;, the character was named Bowser. His Korean name is not &quot;Gukbap&quot;, but &quot;Kupa&quot;, which is essentially a phonetic round-trip translation. The name was anglicized to Kuppa rather than Koopa in the Japanese versions up until the release of &quot;Super Mario World&quot;.

It is currently unconfirmed how the character received the English language name &quot;Bowser&quot;, or who gave him this name, although there are multiple competing theories. Matthew Byrd of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; noted that one theory comes from &quot;Bowser&quot; being a popular name for pets at the time, while another suggests that Miyamoto himself chose the name because both &quot;Bowser&quot; and &quot;Bibinba&quot; start with B. Another theory still relates to the origins of the surname &quot;Bowser&quot;, derived from a Norman greeting meaning &quot;good sir&quot;, and that it may be used ironically for the character given his diabolical nature.

Within early comics and potentially in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series, Bowser has been referenced to Gamera, the iconic fictional turtle kaiju with the abilities to breathe fire as well as fly by hiding in his shell and spinning it; Bowser&#x27;s ability to perform the latter is called &quot;Gamera Attack&quot; (ガメラアタック, &quot;Gamera Attakku&quot;).

==Characteristics==
Bowser is the King of the Koopas, anthropomorphic turtles that inhabit the world of the Mushroom Kingdom. Bowser differs greatly from the rest of the Koopa clan, which consists mainly of bipedal tortoises. He has a large, spiked turtle shell, horns, a draconic muzzle with fangs, taloned fingers, three clawed toes on each foot, red eyes, and a shock of red hair. He has immense physical strength, is nearly indestructible, can breathe fire, and can jump very high for his large size. He is accomplished in black magic for teleportation, summoning objects, flying, generating electricity, telekinesis, or metamorphosis.

Bowser&#x27;s physical size varies and in most games, he towers over most characters. In &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot;, he stands only slightly taller than Mario. He changes his size at will or through others&#x27; sorcery in games including &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Galaxy&quot;, and &quot;Super Mario Galaxy 2&quot;.

Bowser aspires to take over the Mushroom Kingdom and merge it with his own realm. He is infatuated with Princess Peach, and routinely kidnaps her as part of his plans for domination. Sometimes, he kidnaps Peach simply to lure Mario into a trap, but occasionally he hopes to marry her, such as in &quot;Super Mario Odyssey&quot;. He is typically the central antagonist in the main series, but in the RPG series, he sometimes works with the heroes to defeat a greater evil. His personality is generally menacing and sinister, but he sometimes displays a more comical side as a blustering, buffoonish bully with some emotional vulnerability. He also cares for his minions.

Originally in &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot;, Bowser was stated to be the father of the Koopalings with subsequent official sources adding that he is their biological father, but since their return in &quot;New Super Mario Bros. Wii&quot; they have been referred to as Bowser&#x27;s minions. Bowser Jr. was introduced as Bowser&#x27;s son in the 2002 game &quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot;. In a 2012 interview, Shigeru Miyamoto stated, &quot;Our current story is that the seven Koopalings are not Bowser&#x27;s children. Bowser&#x27;s only child is Bowser Jr., and we do not know who the mother is.&quot;

==Appearances==

Bowser debuted in the video game &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;. He then appeared through all &quot;Super Mario&quot; games (with the exception of games such as &quot;Super Mario Land&quot;), the &quot;Paper Mario&quot; series, the &quot;Yoshi&quot; series, and the &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi&quot; series.

===Other &quot;Mario&quot; games===
Bowser has appeared in nearly all of the &quot;Mario&quot; spin-off games, including in the &quot;Mario Kart&quot; and &quot;Mario Party&quot; series. Bowser appeared in multiple &quot;Mario&quot; sports games, such as &quot;Mario Tennis&quot;, &quot;Mario Golf&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Strikers&quot;, and &quot;Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games&quot;.
He appeared in &quot;Mario&#x27;s Time Machine&quot;, &quot;Hotel Mario&quot;, and &quot;Mario Pinball Land&quot;. Bowser appears as a playable character in &quot;Itadaki Street DS&quot; and its Wii sequel &quot;Fortune Street&quot;. Bowser is also a Dark attribute character who appears as the main opponent in &quot;Puzzle &amp; Dragons: Super Mario Bros. Edition&quot;.
Bowser appears in &quot;Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars&quot;. In &quot;Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle&quot;, Bowser makes a cameo. He also reappears in the sequel &quot;Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope&quot;.

===Other games===
Bowser is a playable character in every installment of the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series since 2001&#x27;s &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;. He was intended to be playable in the series&#x27; first installment, but was removed during development due to time constraints. Bowser is in &quot;Tetris Attack&quot;, a game inspired by the Japanese game Panel de Pon. All of the original cast members are replaced except Mr. Time, with characters from the Mario and Yoshi series, with Bowser taking on the role of Corderia as final boss. With the name Hammer Slam Bowser, Bowser debuts as a playable character in &quot;&quot;. He appears alongside &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; and comes with a &quot;Skylanders&quot; unique figurine. Dr. Bowser is playable in &quot;Dr. Mario World&quot;.

===In other media===
Dennis Hopper portrayed King Koopa in the 1993 live-action film &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; In the film, Koopa is the usurper ruler of Dinohattan, a city in a parallel universe in which humans evolved directly from dinosaurs. He abducts Princess Daisy but is eventually defeated by Mario and Luigi. This incarnation is almost entirely human in appearance, with blonde hair he gels in a crown-like shape, and he frequently wears a black business suit and necktie. However, after brief exposure to his own evolution-reversing technology by the Mario Bros., he starts occasionally possessing some reptilian traits. The climax of the film sees Koopa devolve into an enormous green &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; to battle the Mario Bros., who further devolve him into primordial ooze.

Bowser is one of the gaming villains attending a &quot;Bad-Anon&quot; support group in the 2012 animated film &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot;. The writers had early on envisioned the Bad-anon meeting with Bowser as a major character within the scene; according to film director Rich Moore, Nintendo was very positive towards this use, stating in Moore&#x27;s own words, &quot;If there is a group that is dedicated to helping the bad guy characters in video games then Bowser must be in that group!&quot;

Bowser was voiced by Jack Black in &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot; (2023). In the film, Bowser successfully captures the Super Star from the Penguin Kingdom and plots to destroy the Mushroom Kingdom unless Princess Peach agrees to marry him. His plans are ultimately foiled by Mario and Luigi, who retrieve the Super Star from Bowser, and defeat him in a final battle taking place in Brooklyn. Bowser is then shrunk with a Mini Mushroom and imprisoned in a bottle. In a mid-credit scene, Bowser is singing his song from earlier in the film, but he is scolded by a guard. This has also made Bowser the subject of an Internet meme with the song &quot;Peaches&quot;, written and performed in character by Black.

He appeared in &quot;Nintendo gamebooks&quot;. Bowser appears as the primary antagonist in Nintendo Power&#x27;s comic series &quot;Super Mario Adventures&quot;. Bowser reappears in the Mario comics of Valiant Comics&#x27; &quot;Nintendo Comics System&quot; as the principal antagonist of the Mushroom Kingdom.

==Reception and legacy==

Due largely to the success of the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise, Bowser has become one of the most iconic and easily recognizable video game antagonists of all time. He frequently appears in lists for greatest video game antagonists. &quot;IGN&quot; placed him at No. 2 out of 100, and &quot;GamePro&quot; placed him at No. 9 out of 47. &quot;GameSpot&quot; listed him at No. 9 in their &quot;Top 10 Video Game Villains&quot; article, stating &quot;Of all the villains to make an appearance on this list, Bowser... has got to be the most interesting,&quot; later adding &quot;While some people say Bowser&#x27;s life may have gotten into a rut, the man has simply refined his game down to an everyday thing. He&#x27;s focused, he&#x27;s dedicated, and worst of all, he&#x27;s patient.&quot; Bowser ranked in the first slot on &quot;GameDaily&quot;″s top 10 Nintendo characters that deserve their own games list, explaining if Yoshi and Wario get their own games, Bowser should too due to his being one of gaming&#x27;s most nefarious villains. In &quot;GameDaily&quot;″s top 10 Smash Bros. characters list, he ranked sixth. &quot;GameDaily&quot; also included him in their most persistent video game villains list. However, Bowser has been also rated as the 4th-biggest douchebag in gaming history by &quot;ScrewAttack&quot;, who said that he wants to &quot;take Mario down&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; editor Craig Harris described Bowser as being a household name. In 2011, &quot;Empire&quot; ranked him as the 23rd-greatest video game character while &quot;Guinness World Records Gamer&#x27;s Edition 2013&quot; featured Bowser first in their list of top 50 Villains. &quot;IGN&quot; named Bowser as one of the &quot;oldest villains in gaming history, not to mention one of the most iconic.&quot;

Bowser&#x27;s role in &quot;Super Mario Galaxy&quot; has been met with significant praise. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; editor Margaret Robertson commented that after years of being a &quot;comedy villain&quot;, &quot;Galaxy&quot; put him back at his &quot;scaly, scabrous best&quot;. &quot;PALGN&quot; editor Chris Sell called him the best boss in &quot;Mario Galaxy&quot;, stating that it wasn&#x27;t just because of the battles with him being &quot;superb, screen filling affairs&quot;, but also because he is &quot;back to being mean again&quot;. &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot; editor Aaron Kaluszka commented that battling Bowser has never been &quot;this intense and engaging&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; editor Cam Shea praised his physical appearance in &quot;Super Mario Galaxy&quot;, describing him as &quot;imposing and weighty&quot;. Another &quot;IGN&quot; editor, Matt Casamassina, praised the visual quality of the characters, citing Bowser in particular and mentioning how his &quot;funky red fur waggles in the wind&quot;. &quot;Game Positive&quot; editor Travis Simmons concurred, commenting that his hair &quot;gives him a touch of personality&quot;.

Bowser&#x27;s role in &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi: Bowser&#x27;s Inside Story&quot; has highly positive reception, frequently referenced as its main character. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; editor Christian Donlan commented that it felt good to play as Bowser, and that &quot;After years of picking a path carefully around threats, jumping out of harm&#x27;s way, and tackling challengers mostly from above, it&#x27;s a pleasure to put those cares aside and relish a few hours of spiky, tortoise-shelled power.&quot; &quot;Destructoid&quot; editor Jim Sterling described Bowser&#x27;s gameplay as &quot;brilliant comic relief&quot;. He also described the dialogue of the game as being &quot;laugh out loud funny&quot;, specifically praising Bowser&#x27;s ego. &quot;RPGamer&quot; editor Michael Cunningham praised the game for Bowser &quot;stealing the show&quot;, but also decried it for not having quite enough of him. &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot; editor Pedro Hernandez commented that the plot and humor of the game make iconic characters &quot;more enduring, including Bowser&quot;.

&quot;NGamer&quot; magazine editor Matthew Castle commented that all &quot;Mario&quot; role-playing games make good use of Bowser, but that this is the first game where Bowser takes the center stage. &quot;Game Style&quot; editor Drew Middlemas commented that Bowser stole the show, being portrayed as a &quot;creature of pure, blustering ego who reminds us of why he&#x27;s one of gaming&#x27;s greatest baddies.&quot; &quot;N-Europe&quot; editor called him the &quot;real star&quot; of the game, calling him a &quot;fantastic character&quot; with &quot;so much more to give than what we&#x27;ve seen from him so far, even in the other Mario RPGs&quot;. He added that his &quot;foul mood and lack of intelligence&quot; as well as his interactions with other characters are well written. &quot;Kombo&quot; editor commented that he became a more sympathetic character as the game progresses, adding that his &quot;massive ego pushes him towards heroism&quot;. &quot;Wired&quot; editor Chris Kohler called Bowser awesome, adding that his segments are funnier than Mario and Luigi&#x27;s. &quot;Giant Bomb&quot; editor Brad Shoemaker states that Bowser steals the show, commenting that playing as him gives players an inside glimpse of his ego and megalomania. &quot;IGN&quot; editor Craig Harris described Bowser as the only &quot;core Nintendo character over the past couple decades&quot; to not have a starring role in a video game, and this game acts as his &quot;big break&quot;. &quot;1UP.com&quot; editor Jeremy Parish stated that Bowser makes the game, describing him as more interesting than &quot;Bowser&#x27;s Inside Story&quot; predecessor&#x27;s partners, the baby forms of Mario and Luigi. &quot;GamePro&quot; editor Alicia Ashby called Bowser one of the most &quot;lovable characters in the Nintendo universe&quot;, and praising &quot;Bowser&#x27;s Inside Story&quot; for giving him &quot;much deserved time in the spotlight&quot;. &quot;GameSpy&quot; editor Phil Theobald called him the breakout star of the game, stating that &quot;the gruff, quick-to-anger pro/antagonist is a treat to watch as he continuously becomes infuriated with the incompetence of his minions.&quot; &quot;GamesRadar&quot; editor Henry Gilbert stated that he is &quot;home to the most drastic change to the formula&quot; in this game, stating that while he is still a &quot;humorously incapable villain&quot;, the game allows players to switch between Bowser and the Mario Bros. at their discretion.&quot;

Some &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; fans joked that Mario supposedly shouts, &quot;So long, gay Bowser!&quot; when throwing him a great distance. In April 2019, Charles Martinet, Mario&#x27;s voice actor, tweeted that Mario says, &quot;So long, King-a Bowser!&quot;. In the Japanese Rumble Pak-compatible version, as well as &quot;Super Mario 64 DS&quot; and &quot;Super Mario 3D All-Stars&quot;, Mario instead says &quot;buh-bye!&quot;, which Nintendo later confirmed in a tweet.

In the 2018 short comic &quot;The Super Crown&#x27;s some spicy new Mario lore&quot; on DeviantArt and Twitter, Bowser uses a Super Crown to transform into a monstrously sinister female resembling Peach, which fans named Bowsette. The character subsequently went viral. In 2015, the alligator snapping turtle of the Amur River was discovered and became an Internet sensation for its resemblance to Bowser. &quot;Bowser Day 2021&quot; became a Twitter fad.

On 8 September 2014, the Conseil de la Nation Atikamekw declared unilaterally the sovereignty of the Atikamekw Nation on the Nistaskinan. The objective of this is mainly to obtain a right of review for the projects exploiting the natural resources and to highlight the Atikamekw&#x27;s identity. &quot;Nitaskinan&quot; means &quot;our (excl.) land&quot; in the Atikamekw language, where &quot;Kitaskinan&quot; means &quot;our (inclusive) land,&quot; similar to other Cree languages&#x27; use of &quot;aski&quot;.

<doc id="81503" wikidata="Q179215" url="?curid=81503" title="Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom">
<text>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is a 1984 American action-adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg from a script by Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz, based on a story by George Lucas. It is the second installment in the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; film series and a prequel to &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. The film stars Harrison Ford, who reprises his role as the title character. Kate Capshaw, Amrish Puri, Roshan Seth, Philip Stone, and Ke Huy Quan, in his film debut, star in supporting roles. In the film, after arriving in British India, Indiana Jones is asked by desperate villagers to find a mystical stone and rescue their children from a Thuggee cult practicing child slavery, black magic, and ritual human sacrifice in honor of the goddess Kali.

Not wishing to feature the Nazis as the villains again, executive producer and story writer George Lucas decided to regard this film as a prequel. Three plot devices were rejected before Lucas wrote a film treatment that resembled the final storyline. As Lawrence Kasdan, Lucas&#x27;s collaborator on &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, turned down the offer to write the script, Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz, who had previously worked with Lucas on &quot;American Graffiti&quot; (1973), were hired as his replacements.

&quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; was released on May 23, 1984, to financial success, grossing $333.1 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of 1984. Initial critical reviews were mixed, with criticism aimed at its strong violence, as well as some of its darker story elements, and there was controversy over its portrayal of India. Critical opinion has improved since 1984, citing the film&#x27;s intensity and imagination. In response to some of the more violent sequences in the film, and with similar complaints about the Spielberg-produced &quot;Gremlins&quot; (which released two weeks later), Spielberg suggested that the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) alter its rating system, which it did within two months of the film&#x27;s release, creating a new PG-13 rating. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Score and won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects. A third film, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;, followed in 1989.

==Plot==
In 1935, American archeologist Indiana Jones survives a murder attempt from Shanghai crime boss Lao Che, who hired him to retrieve the remains of Nurhaci. Indy flees from the city accompanied by his young orphan sidekick Short Round and nightclub singer Willie Scott, unaware that the plane they are traveling on is owned by Che. The plane&#x27;s pilots dump the fuel and parachute away, but Indy, Willie and Short Round escape using an inflatable raft before the plane crashes. The trio ride down the slopes of the Himalayas and fall into a river before arriving at the Indian village of Mayapore. There, the villagers plead for Indy&#x27;s aid in retrieving a sacred lingam stone stolen along with the village&#x27;s children by evil forces from the nearby Pankot Palace. Indy agrees to do so, hypothesizing that the stone is one of the five Sankara stones given by the Hindu gods to help humanity fight evil. Traveling to the palace, the trio are warmly welcomed and allowed to stay for the night as guests, attending a banquet hosted by the palace&#x27;s young maharaja.

During the night, Indy is attacked by an assassin, but manages to kill him. He discovers a series of tunnels underneath the palace and explores them with Willie and Short Round. The trio eventually reaches a massive temple where they uncover Thuggee cultists conducting a human sacrifice. The cult, which possesses three Sankara stones, is revealed to have abducted the children of Mayapore, using them as slave labor to find the remaining stones. During an attempt to retrieve the stones, Indy is captured alongside Willie and Short Round. Thuggee high priest Mola Ram forces Indy to drink a potion that places him into a trance-like state, which makes Indy prepare Willie for sacrifice. Short Round is briefly enslaved in the tunnels, but he escapes and intercepts Willie&#x27;s sacrifice by freeing Indy from his trance, who rescues Willie in turn.

The trio defeat multiple cultists, collect the Sankara stones and free the children. After escaping an attempt by Mola Ram to drown them, the trio crosses a rope bridge above a river. Mola Ram ambushes them again, leading Indy to cut the bridge in two, causing a number of cultists to fall into the crocodile-infested water below. As Indy, Willie, Short Round, and Mola Ram struggle to climb up the broken bridge, Indy invokes the name of Shiva, prompting the stones to burn through his satchel. One stone burns Mola Ram and he falls to the river, where he is devoured by the crocodiles. British Indian Army soldiers arrive and defeat the remaining cultists, and Indy, Willie, and Short Round return to Mayapore to hand over their last remaining stone. As the villagers are reunited with their children, Indy and Willie embrace.

==Cast==

* Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones: An archaeologist adventurer who is asked by a desperate Indian village to retrieve a mysterious stone and rescue the missing village children. Ford undertook a strict physical exercise regimen headed by Jake Steinfeld to gain a more muscular tone for the part.
* Kate Capshaw as Wilhelmina &quot;Willie&quot; Scott: An American nightclub singer working in Shanghai. In a nod to the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, the nightclub is called &quot;Club Obi Wan&quot;. Willie is unprepared for her adventure with Indy and Short Round, and appears to be a damsel in distress. She also forms a romantic relationship with Indy. Over 120 actresses auditioned for the role, including Sharon Stone. To prepare for the role, Capshaw watched &quot;The African Queen&quot; and &quot;A Guy Named Joe&quot;. Spielberg wanted Willie to be a complete contrast to Marion Ravenwood from &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, so Capshaw dyed her brown hair blonde for the part. Costume designer Anthony Powell wanted the character to have red hair.
* Ke Huy Quan as Short Round: Indy&#x27;s young Chinese sidekick, who drives the 1936 Auburn Boat Tail Speedster that allows Indy to escape during the opening sequence. Quan was chosen as part of a casting call in Los Angeles. Around 6,000 actors auditioned worldwide for the part, including Peter Shinkoda; Quan was cast after his brother auditioned for the role. Spielberg liked his personality, so he and Ford improvised the scene where Short Round accuses Indy of cheating during a card game.
* Amrish Puri as Mola Ram: A Thuggee priest who performs rites of human sacrifices. The character is named after an 18th-century Indian painter. Lucas wanted Mola Ram to be terrifying, so the screenwriters added elements of Aztec and Hawaiian human sacrificers and European devil worship to the character. To create his headdress, make-up artist Tom Smith based the skull on a cow (as this would be sacrilegious), and used a latex shrunken head.
* Roshan Seth as Chattar Lal: The Prime Minister of the Maharaja of Pankot. Chattar, also a Thuggee worshipper, is enchanted by Indy, Willie, and Short Round&#x27;s arrival, but is offended by Indy&#x27;s questioning of the palace&#x27;s history and the archaeologist&#x27;s own dubious past.
* Philip Stone as Captain Philip Blumburtt: A British Indian Army officer on a routine inspection tour of Pankot Palace and the surrounding area. He assists Indiana by fighting off Thuggee cultists at the bridge with his regiment, the 11th Poona Rifles.

Additionally, Roy Chiao portrays Lao Che, a Shanghai crime boss who, with his sons Chen (Chua Kah Joo) and Kao Kan (Ric Young), hires Indy to recover the cremated ashes of one of his ancestors. David Yip (in his film debut) portrays Wu Han, a friend of Indy, who is killed in Club Obi Wan. Raj Singh portrays Zalim Singh, the adolescent Maharajá of Pankot (his voice is dubbed by Katie Leigh), and D. R. Nanayakkara portrays the village Shaman, the leader of a small village that recruits Indy to retrieve their stolen sacred Shiva lingam stone. Denawaka Hamine and Iranganie Serasinghe play two of the village women.

Professional wrestler Pat Roach plays the Thuggee overseer in the mines whom Indy has a large brawl with; Roach had previously appeared as a German mechanic and a Giant Sherpa who brawls with Indy in &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. Dan Aykroyd appears briefly and with a British accent as Weber, who escorts Jones, Short Round, and Willie from their car to the plane. Spielberg, Lucas, Marshall, and Kennedy have cameos at the airport.

===Development===
Spielberg later recalled that when Lucas first approached him for &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, &quot;George said if I directed the first one then I would have to direct a trilogy. He had three stories in mind. It turned out George did not have three stories in mind and we had to make up subsequent stories.&quot; Both men later attributed the film&#x27;s tone, which was darker than &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, to their personal moods following the breakups of their relationships. In addition, Lucas felt &quot;it had to have been a dark film. The way &quot;Empire Strikes Back&quot; was the dark second act of the Star Wars trilogy.&quot; Spielberg had said &quot;The danger in making a sequel is that you can never satisfy everyone. If you give people the same movie with different scenes, they say why weren&#x27;t you more original?&quot; &quot;But if you give them the same character in another fantastic adventure, but with a different tone, you risk disappointing the other half of the audience who just wanted a carbon copy of the first film with a different girl and a different bad guy. So you win and you lose both ways.&quot;

Lucas set the film in an earlier year than the first to avoid repeating the use of Nazis as the villains. Spielberg originally wanted to bring Marion Ravenwood back, with Abner Ravenwood considered as a possible character. In developing the story, Lucas conceived of an opening chase scene with Indiana Jones on a motorcycle on the Great Wall of China, followed by the discovery of a &quot;&quot;Lost World&quot; pastiche with a hidden valley inhabited by dinosaurs&quot;. Another idea was to feature the Monkey King as the plot device. However, Chinese authorities refused permission for them to film in the country, requiring a different setting. Lucas wrote a film treatment that included a haunted castle in Scotland, but Spielberg felt it was too similar to &quot;Poltergeist&quot;; so the setting transformed into a demonic temple in India.

Lucas came up with ideas that involved a religious cult devoted to child slavery, black magic, and ritual human sacrifice. Lawrence Kasdan of &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; was asked to write the script. &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to be associated with &quot;Temple of Doom&quot;,&quot; he reflected. &quot;I just thought it was horrible. It&#x27;s so mean. There&#x27;s nothing pleasant about it. I think &quot;Temple of Doom&quot; represents a chaotic period in both their [Lucas&#x27;s and Spielberg&#x27;s] lives, and the movie is very ugly and mean-spirited.&quot; Lucas hired Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz to write the script because of their knowledge of Indian culture. &quot;Gunga Din&quot; served as an influence for the film.

Huyck and Katz spent four days at Skywalker Ranch for story discussions with Lucas and Spielberg in early 1982. They later said the early plot consisted of two notions of Lucas&#x27;: that Indy would recover something stolen from a village and decide whether to give it back, and that the picture would start in China and work its way to India. Huyck says Lucas was very single-minded about getting through meetings, while &quot;Steve would always stop and think about visual stuff.&quot;

Lucas&#x27;s initial idea for Indiana&#x27;s sidekick was a virginal young princess, but Huyck, Katz, and Spielberg disliked the idea. Just as Indiana Jones was named after Lucas&#x27;s Alaskan Malamute, the character of Willie was named after Spielberg&#x27;s Cocker Spaniel, and Short Round was named after Huyck&#x27;s dog, whose name was derived from &quot;The Steel Helmet&quot;.

Lucas handed Huyck and Katz a 20-page treatment in May 1982 titled &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Death&quot; to adapt into a screenplay. Scenes such as the fight scene in Shanghai, the escape from the airplane, and the mine cart chase came from earlier scripts of &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. In &quot;Raiders,&quot; the headpiece for the Staff of Ra was originally conceived to be in two pieces, with the first piece in the museum of General Hok, a Japanese-allied Chinese warlord in Shanghai. Jones was planned to steal that piece, and then use a giant gong as a shield as General Hok fired a submachine gun at him during his escape, much like the final moments in Club Obi-Wan. Kasdan said that was too expensive to produce for the earlier movie. After that, Jones was to fly to Nepal to find Marion and the second piece. In flight, he fell asleep and all of the other passengers on the plane bailed out and parachuted to safety, leaving him to escape alone using an inflatable raft to slide down a Himalayan slope to Marion&#x27;s bar. Kasdan said this was cut because it interrupted the story flow and was &quot;too unbelievable,&quot; a complaint leveled by some critics at the finished scene.

Lucas, Huyck, and Katz had been developing &quot;Radioland Murders&quot; (1994) since the early 1970s. The opening music was taken from that script and applied to &quot;Temple of Doom&quot;. Spielberg reflected, &quot;George&#x27;s idea was to start the movie with a musical number. He wanted to do a Busby Berkeley dance number. At all our story meetings he would say, &#x27;Hey, Steven, you always said you wanted to shoot musicals.&#x27; I thought, &#x27;Yeah, that could be fun.

Lucas, Spielberg, Katz, and Huyck were concerned how to keep the audience interest while explaining the Thuggee cult. Huyck and Katz proposed a tiger hunt but Spielberg said, &quot;There&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going to stay in India long enough to shoot a tiger hunt.&quot; They eventually decided on a dinner scene involving eating bugs (which were made of rubber and filled with custard), monkey brains (raspberry flavored custard), and the like. &quot;Steve and George both still react like children, so their idea was to make it as gross as possible,&quot; says Katz.

Lucas sent Huyck and Katz a 500-page transcript of their taped conversations to help them with the script. The first draft was written in six weeks, in early August 1982. &quot;Steve was coming off an enormously successful movie [&quot;E.T.&quot;] and George didn&#x27;t want to lose him,&quot; said Katz. &quot;He desperately wanted him to direct (&quot;Temple of Doom&quot;). We were under a lot of pressure to do it really, really fast so we could hold on to Steve.&quot;

A second draft was finished by September. Captain Blumburtt, Chattar Lal, and the boy Maharaja originally had more crucial roles. A dogfight scene was deleted, as were scenes where those who drank the Kali blood turned into zombies with physical superhuman abilities. During pre-production, the &quot;Temple of Death&quot; title was replaced with &quot;Temple of Doom&quot;. From March to April 1983, Huyck and Katz simultaneously performed rewrites for a final shooting script. One scene that made it into the script, but was dropped during filming, was about a snake coiling around Willie. As Capshaw suffers from fear of snakes, Spielberg noticed how difficult it was for her, and decided to skip it.

Huyck and Katz later said Harrison Ford took many of the one liners originally given to Short Round.

===Casting===

Harrison Ford reprised his role of Indiana Jones from &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. For the role of Willie Scott, more than 100 actresses auditioned. Among the totally unknown actresses auditioning for the role was Sharon Stone. Finally, Spielberg chose Kate Capshaw after viewing her videotaped test and showing it to Harrison Ford. For the role of Short Round, casting director Mike Fenton arranged open calls for East Asian boys to come in to audition in several major cities, including New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Hawaii, Toronto, Chicago, Montreal, Hong Kong, and London. Originally, Ke Huy Quan&#x27;s younger brother went to audition for the role while Quan tagged along. The producers had noticed that Quan was giving his brother directions behind the camera during the audition, so the casting director had asked Quan to give it a shot, and was cast a few days later.

For the various Indian characters in the film, the villagers were played by Sri Lankan actors and actresses, while the characters in Pankot Palace were primarily played by Indian actors. For the role of Mola Ram, the arch-villain, they searched through England and the United States to find someone to play the part, as both Lucas and Spielberg were most anxious that they did not cast the principal Indian roles with Western actors darkened down. They couldn&#x27;t find anybody amongst the resident Indian actors in the United States, and so they got a permit for Amrish Puri, who was working on 18 films in India simultaneously at the time of his casting. Puri had met with Spielberg and initially declined the role, but was convinced after speaking with Richard Attenborough, whom Puri had worked with on a small part in &quot;Gandhi.&quot; Roshan Seth, who played prime minister Chattar Lal, also appeared in &quot;Gandhi&quot; alongside Puri.

===Filming===
The filmmakers were denied permission to film in North India and Amer Fort, due to the government finding the script offensive. Producer Frank Marshall explained that &quot;originally the scenes were going to be shot in India at a fantastic palace. They required us to give them a script, so we sent it over and we didn&#x27;t think it was going to be a problem. But because of the voodoo element with Mola Ram and the Thuggees, the Indian government was a little bit hesitant to give us permission. They wanted us to do things like not use the term Maharajah, and they didn&#x27;t want us to shoot in a particular temple that we had picked. The Indian government wanted changes to the script and final cut privilege.&quot;

As a result, location work went to Kandy, Sri Lanka, with matte paintings and scale models applied for the village, temple, and Pankot Palace. Budgetary inflation also caused &quot;Temple of Doom&quot; to cost $28.17 million, $8 million more than &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. Filming began on April 18, 1983, in Kandy, and moved to Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, England on May 5. Marshall recalled, &quot;when filming the bug scenes, crew members would go home and find bugs in their hair, clothes and shoes.&quot; Eight out of the nine sound stages at Elstree housed the filming of &quot;Temple of Doom&quot;. Lucas biographer Marcus Hearn observed, &quot;Douglas Slocombe&#x27;s skillful lighting helped disguise the fact that about 80 percent of the film was shot with sound stages.&quot;

Danny Daniels choreographed the opening music number &quot;Anything Goes&quot;. Capshaw learned to sing in Mandarin and took tap dance lessons. However the dress was fitted so tightly that Capshaw was not able to dance in it. Made by Barbara Matera out of original 1920s and 1930s beads, the dress was one of a kind. The opening dance number was actually the last scene to be shot, but the dress did feature in some earlier location shots in Sri Lanka, drying on a nearby tree. Unfortunately an elephant had started to eat it, tearing the whole back of the dress. Consequently, some emergency repair work had to be done by Matera with what remained of the original beads, and it was costume designer Anthony Powell who had to fill in the insurance forms. As to the reason for damage, he had no option but to put &quot;dress eaten by elephant&quot;.

In a 2003 documentary on the making of the film (first released when the original trilogy made its debut on DVD), costume designer Anthony Powell stated that only one evening dress was made for Capshaw due to the limited amount of original 1920s and 1930s beads and sequins (story above). However, there have been more than one of Capshaw&#x27;s evening dresses on display at the same time in different countries during exhibitions – from late 2014, a dress was on display at the Hollywood Costume exhibition in Los Angeles (exhibition ran from October 2, 2014 – March 2, 2015). At the very same time, the traveling &quot;Indiana Jones: Adventure of Archaeology&quot; exhibition was on display in Edmonton in Canada (October 11, 2014 – April 6, 2015) and there featured another of the red and gold dresses.

Production designer Norman Reynolds could not return for &quot;Temple of Doom&quot; because of his commitment to &quot;Return to Oz&quot;. Elliot Scott (&quot;Labyrinth&quot;, &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;), Reynolds&#x27; mentor, was hired. To build the rope bridge the filmmakers found a group of British engineers from Balfour Beatty working on the nearby Victoria Dam. Harrison Ford suffered a severe spinal disc herniation by performing a somersault while filming the scene with the assassin in Jones&#x27;s bedroom. A hospital bed was brought on set for Ford to rest between takes. Lucas stated, &quot;He could barely stand up, yet he was there every day so shooting would not stop. He was in incomprehensible pain, but he was still trying to make it happen.&quot; With no alternatives, Lucas shut down production while Ford was flown to Centinela Hospital on June 21 for recovery. Stunt double Vic Armstrong spent five weeks as a stand-in for various shots. Wendy Leech, Armstrong&#x27;s wife, served as Capshaw&#x27;s stunt double.

Macau (then a Portuguese colony) was substituted for Shanghai, while cinematographer Douglas Slocombe caught fever from June 24 to July 7 and could not work. Ford returned on August 8. Despite the problems during filming, Spielberg was able to complete &quot;Temple of Doom&quot; on schedule and on budget, finishing principal photography on August 26. Various pickups took place afterwards. This included Mammoth Mountain, Tuolumne River, American River, Yosemite National Park, San Joaquin Valley, Hamilton Air Force Base (all located in California), Snake River Canyon in Idaho, and Arizona. Producer Marshall directed a second unit in Florida in January 1984, using alligators to double as crocodiles. The mine chase was a combination of a roller coaster and scale models with dolls doubling for the actors. Minor stop-motion was also used for the sequence. Visual effects supervisors Dennis Muren, Joe Johnston and a crew at Industrial Light &amp; Magic provided the visual effects work, while Skywalker Sound, headed by Ben Burtt, commissioned the sound design. Burtt recorded roller coasters at Disneyland Park in Anaheim for the mine cart scene. Marshall recalls that filming the bugs was difficult, more so than the snakes in the first film: &quot;The bugs were much harder to work with than the snakes. You can arrange a pile of snakes. That&#x27;s impossible with bugs. People were also much more scared of the insects. Every once in a while you&#x27;d hear this shriek when the bugs found their way on to the tap-dance rehearsal stage - a bad place for any bug to be.&quot; Ke Huy Quan recalled that while filming a scary sequence, he started crying until Ford calm him down saying &quot;I will never hurt you!&quot;.

===Editing===
&quot;After I showed the film to George [Lucas], at an hour and 55 minutes, we looked at each other,&quot; Spielberg remembered. &quot;The first thing that we said was, &#x27;Too fast&#x27;. We needed to decelerate the action. I did a few more matte shots to slow it down. We made it a little bit slower, by putting breathing room back in so there&#x27;d be a two-hour oxygen supply for the audience.&quot;

==Reception==

===Critical response===
&quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; received mixed reviews upon its release, but over the years the film&#x27;s critical reception has improved. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of . The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;It may be too &#x27;dark&#x27; for some, but &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; remains an ingenious adventure spectacle that showcases one of Hollywood&#x27;s finest filmmaking teams in vintage form.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 57 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave the film a perfect four-star rating, calling it &quot;one of the greatest Bruised Forearm Movies ever made. You know what a Bruised Forearm Movie is. That&#x27;s the kind of movie where your date is always grabbing your forearm in a viselike grip, as unbearable excitement unfolds on the screen...&quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; makes no apologies for being exactly what it is: Exhilarating, manic, wildly imaginative escapism. No apologies are necessary. This is the most cheerfully exciting, bizarre, goofy, romantic adventure movie since &quot;Raiders,&quot; and it is high praise to say that it&#x27;s not so much a sequel as an equal... You stagger out with a silly grin -- and a bruised forearm, of course.&quot; Vincent Canby felt the film was &quot;too shapeless to be the fun that &quot;Raiders&quot; is, but shape may be beside the point. Old-time, 15-part movie serials didn&#x27;t have shape. They just went on and on and on, which is what &quot;Temple of Doom&quot; does with humor and technical invention.&quot; Neal Gabler commented that &quot;I think in some ways, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; was better than &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. In some ways it was less. In sum total, I&#x27;d have to say I enjoyed it more. That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s better necessarily, but I got more enjoyment out of it.&quot;

Colin Covert of the &quot;Star Tribune&quot; called the film &quot;sillier, darkly violent and a bit dumbed down, but still great fun.&quot; Pauline Kael preferred it to &quot;Raiders&quot;, writing: &quot;The subject of a movie can be momentum. It has often been the true—even if not fully acknowledged—subject of movies. In &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot;, it&#x27;s not just acknowledged, it&#x27;s gloried in...The whole movie is a shoot-the-chutes, and toward the end, when the heroic trio, having found the sacred stone and freed the stolen children from the maharajah&#x27;s mines, are trying to escape in a tiny mine car, and a shift in camera angles places us with them on a literal rollercoaster ride, the audience laughs in recognition that that&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve been on all along...The movie relates to Americans&#x27; love of getting in the car and just taking off—it&#x27;s a breeze.&quot;

Dave Kehr stated &quot;The film betrays no human impulse higher than that of a ten-year-old boy trying to gross out his baby sister by dangling a dead worm in her face.&quot; Ralph Novak of &quot;People&quot; complained &quot;The ads that say &#x27;this film may be too intense for younger children&#x27; are fraudulent. No parent should allow a young child to see this traumatizing movie; it would be a cinematic form of child abuse. Even Harrison Ford is required to slap Quan and abuse Capshaw. There are no heroes connected with the film, only two villains; their names are Steven Spielberg and George Lucas.&quot; &quot;The Observer&quot; described it as &quot;a thin, arch, graceless affair.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; summarized it as &quot;a two-hour series of none too carefully linked chase sequences ... sitting on the edge of your seat gives you a sore bum but also a numb brain.&quot; Leonard Maltin gave the film only two out of four stars, saying that it is &quot;headache inducing&quot; and &quot;never gives us a chance to breathe&quot;, and chiding the gross-out&#x27; gags.&quot; Colin Greenland reviewed the film for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;&quot;Raiders&quot; had the wit and lightness of touch not to take itself too seriously. &quot;Temple&quot; starts well, but promptly loses itself in clamorous self-importance. I couldn&#x27;t care less if it outgrosses &quot;Raiders&quot;. It grossed me out.&quot;

In 2014, &quot;Time Out&quot; polled several film critics, directors, actors, and stunt actors to list their top action films. &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; was listed at 71st place on this list.

Director Quentin Tarantino has stated that &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; is his favorite of the series, as well as Spielberg&#x27;s second-best film behind &quot;Jaws.&quot;&quot;[Spielberg] pushes the envelope, he creates PG-13, a movie so badass it created a new level in the MPAA,&quot; further adding &quot;there is a comedy aspect as gruesome as the cinema is; there is an ultimate comedy aspect that&#x27;s just not quite there as much in the first one.&quot;

===Reception from the cast and crew===
The character Willie Scott has often been criticized for its shrillness, with Capshaw calling Willie &quot;not much more than a dumb screaming blonde,&quot; further adding that she &quot;was blind-sided&quot; by the reaction to her character. &quot;The thing that surprised me the most was that the critics, women critics in particular, were very critical of Willie Scott, as if we were making a political statement and I was doing nothing for my sisters. I found it odd that it was an action-adventure film and we were meant to be doing message work.&quot;

When promoting &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; in 1989, Spielberg said &quot;I wasn&#x27;t happy with &quot;Temple of Doom&quot; at all. It was too dark, too subterranean, and much too horrific. I thought it out-poltered &quot;Poltergeist&quot;. There&#x27;s not an ounce of my own personal feeling in &quot;Temple of Doom&quot;.&quot; He later added during the &quot;Making of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; documentary, &quot;&quot;Temple of Doom&quot; is my least favorite of the trilogy. I look back and I say, &#x27;Well the greatest thing that I got out of that was I met Kate Capshaw.&#x27; We married years later and that to me was the reason I was fated to make &quot;Temple of Doom&quot;.&quot; Lucas, who had been going through a divorce with Marcia Lucas during the making of the film, attributed the film&#x27;s darkness to his relationship problems, but in regard to the film said, &quot;I love the movie, it&#x27;s just slightly darker in tone and not as fun as the first.&quot;

Seth said &quot;Let me tell you - the first 15 minutes of &quot;Indiana Jones And The Temple of Doom&quot; are perhaps the greatest 15 minutes in cinema. They are all about what cinema should be: sitting on the edge of your seat in excitement.&quot; Ford said &quot;I felt it was funny and explored interesting, dark places. That scene where he takes the heart out, that was a new thing, a dark thing. But I enjoyed that about it. It also possesses some of the craziest action, the most energy. I think it is a good film.&quot;

===Awards===
Dennis Muren and Industrial Light &amp; Magic&#x27;s visual effects department won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects at the 57th Academy Awards. Soundtrack composer John Williams was, as he had been for his work on &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, again nominated for Original Music Score. The visual effects crew won the same category at the 38th British Academy Film Awards. Cinematographer Douglas Slocombe, editor Michael Kahn, Ben Burtt and other sound designers at Skywalker Sound received nominations. Spielberg, the writers, Harrison Ford, Jonathan Ke Quan, Anthony Powell and makeup designer Tom Smith were nominated for their work at the Saturn Awards. &quot;Temple of Doom&quot; was nominated for Best Fantasy Film but lost to &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;.

==Controversy==
===Depiction of India===
The depiction of India caused controversy, with the film being not released in cinemas in the country, as the film received a temporary ban in India. The film was later released in the country when it came out on home video. A small protest group of around 30 to 50 people in Seattle, Washington, appeared in the local newspapers when they protested against the film for depicting Indians as either helpless or evil.

The depiction of Indian cuisine was heavily criticized, as dishes such as baby snakes, eyeball soup, beetles, and chilled monkey brains are not Indian foods. Professors such as Yvette Rosser have criticized the film for its portrayal of India, with Rosser writing &quot;[it] seems to have been taken as a valid portrayal of India by many teachers, since a large number of students surveyed complained that teachers referred to the eating of monkey brains.&quot; Another heavily criticized aspect was the film&#x27;s white savior narrative, with Indiana being depicted as a great white hero upon landing in a remote Indian village, with the villagers unable to help themselves.

Roshan Seth, who played Chattar Lal, mentioned that the banquet scene was a joke that went wrong, saying, &quot;Steven intended it as a joke, the joke being that Indians were so smart that they knew all Westerners think that Indians eat cockroaches, so they served them what they expected. The joke was too subtle for that film.&quot;

In his autobiography, Amrish Puri described the whole controversy around the film as &quot;silly&quot;. He wrote that &quot;it&#x27;s based on an ancient cult that existed in India and was recreated like a fantasy. If you recall those imaginary places like Pankot Palace, starting with Shanghai, where the plane breaks down and the passengers use a raft to jump over it, slide down a hill and reach India, can this ever happen? But fantasies are fantasies, like our Panchatantra and folklore. I know we are sensitive about our cultural identity, but we do this to ourselves in our own films. It&#x27;s only when some foreign directors do it that we start cribbing.&quot;

===PG rating===
Many parents who took their children to see the film complained that some sequences in the film were too violent for its PG rating, particularly sequences involving human sacrifice and children being flogged. Spielberg had initially defended the violence, stating &quot;the picture is not called &quot;Temple of Roses&quot;, it is called &quot;Temple of Doom&quot;. There are parts of this film that are too intense for younger children, but this is a fantasy adventure. It is the kind of violence that does not really happen and cannot be perpetuated by people leaving the cinema and performing those tricks on their friends at home.&quot;

In response to some of the more violent sequences in the film, and with similar complaints about &quot;Gremlins&quot; (which released two weeks later), Spielberg suggested that the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) alter its rating system by introducing an intermediary between the PG and R ratings. The MPAA concurred, and a new PG-13 rating was introduced two months after the film&#x27;s release. In the UK, the film was heavily censored for a PG rating. The United Kingdom followed suit five years later, with the BBFC introducing the 12 rating and &quot;Batman&quot; (1989) being the first film to receive it. &quot;Temple of Doom&quot; was itself re-rated 12, uncut, in 2012.

<text>In Greek mythology, Laomedon (; , &quot;Lāomédōn&quot;, &quot;ruler of the people&quot;) was a Trojan king, son of Ilus and thus nephew of Ganymede and Assaracus.

Laomedon was variously identified with different parents and siblings, as well as numerous children, including Priam and Tithonus. His possible wives were Placia, Strymo, Zeuxippe, or Leucippe. Laomedon owned magical horses with divine parentage, a gift from Zeus to his grandfather Tros in compensation for kidnapping Tros&#x27;s son Ganymede.

Zeus sent Poseidon and Apollo to serve Laomedon as punishment for a conspiracy against Zeus. The two gods built walls around Troy, but Laomedon refused to pay them, leading to a pestilence and a sea monster attacking the city. To end the calamities, Laomedon had to sacrifice his daughter Hesione to the sea monster. Heracles arrived and agreed to save Hesione in exchange for the magical horses, but Laomedon went back on his promise, causing Heracles to wage war on Troy.

Heracles eventually conquered the city, killing Laomedon and his sons, except for Podarces. Hesione was given to Telamon as a war prize, and she ransomed her brother Podarces, who then became known as Priam.

== Family ==
Laomedon&#x27;s mother was variously identified as Eurydice, Leucippe or Batia. Thus, his possible siblings are Themiste, Telecleia and sometimes, even Tithonus.

He was the father of Priam, Lampus, Hicetaon, Clytius, Hesione, Cilla, Astyoche, Proclia, Aethilla, Medesicaste and Clytodora. Tithonus is also described by most sources as Laomedon&#x27;s eldest legitimate son, and most sources omit Ganymede from the list of Laomedon&#x27;s children, but indicate him as his uncle instead. Laomedon&#x27;s possible wives were Placia, Strymo (or Rhoeo), Zeuxippe or Leucippe; by the former he begot Tithonus and by the latter King Priam (: &quot;Priamus was the son of Leucippe, whereas Tithonus was the son of Rhoeo or Strymo, the daughter of Scamander&quot;. He also had a son named Bucolion by the nymph Calybe, as recounted by Homer in the &quot;Iliad&quot;. Dictys Cretensis added Thymoetes to the list of Laomedon&#x27;s children.
== Mythology ==
=== Magical horses ===
Laomedon owned several horses with divine parentage that Zeus had given Tros (Laomedon&#x27;s grandfather) as compensation for the kidnapping of Tros&#x27;s son Ganymede. Anchises secretly bred his own mares from these horses.

According to one story, Ganymede was kidnapped by Zeus, who had seen the exceptional Virtue of the boy, as worthy only of Olympus, and ascended the young man into Heaven. Tros grieved for his son. Sympathetic, Zeus sent Hermes with two horses so swift they could run over water. Hermes also assured Tros that Ganymede was immortal and would be the cupbearer for the gods, a position of much distinction. Laomedon himself was the son of Ganymede&#x27;s brother Ilus, the son of Tros.

=== Wrath of gods ===
When Poseidon and Apollo entered a conspiracy to put Zeus in bonds, the supreme god being offended, sent them to serve with King Laomedon as punishment for their nefarious design. In other sources, the two gods simply tested the wantonness of the Laomedon. As ordered by Laomedon who promised wages, the two deities assuming the likeness of men undertook to build huge walls around the city. But when they had finished, the king refused to fulfill their agreement of reward. In vengeance, before the Trojan War, Apollo sent a pestilence to Troy while Poseidon released a sea monster which, carried up by a flood, snatched away the people of the plain.

The oracles foretold deliverance from these calamities if Laomedon would expose his daughter Hesione to be devoured by the sea monster. The king then exposed her by fastening her to the rocks near the sea. But by chance, after fighting the Amazons, Heracles, who had landed at Troy, saw the girl to be sacrificed. The hero promised to save the princess on condition of receiving from Laomedon the mares which Zeus had given in compensation for the ascendance of Ganymede into Olympus to serve the Deities. When Laomedon agreed, Heracles (along with Oicles and Telamon) killed the monster and rescued Hesione at the last minute. But when Laomedon would not give up his magical horses for their deeds, the hero put to sea after threatening to make war on Troy.

=== Siege of Heracles ===
After his servitude, Heracles mustered an army of noble volunteers and sailed for Ilium with eighteen ships of fifty oars each. Having come to port at Ilium, he left the guard of the ships to Oicles and he, with the rest of the champions, set out to attack the city. Meanwhile, Laomedon marched against the ships with a multitude and slew Oicles in battle. But being repulsed by the troops of Heracles, Laomedon was besieged. The siege once laid, Telamon was the first to breach the wall and enter the city, and after him Heracles. When the son of Zeus had taken the city he shot down Laomedon and his sons, except Podarces. Heracles assigned Hesione as a war prize to Telamon (by whom Telamon had a son called Teucer) and allowed her to take with her whomsoever of the captives she would. When Hesione chose Podarces, Heracles said that her brother must first be a slave and then be ransomed by her. So, when the prince was being sold, Hesione took the golden veil from her head and gave it as a ransom; hence Podarces was thereafter called Priam (from &quot;priamai&quot; &#x27;to buy&#x27;).

<text>In Greek mythology, Tros (; Ancient Greek: Τρώς, ) was the founder of the kingdom of Troy, of which the city of Ilios, founded by his son Ilus took the same name, and the son of Erichthonius by Astyoche (daughter of the river god Simoeis) or of Ilus I, from whom he inherited the throne. Tros was the father of three sons: Ilus, Assaracus and Ganymede and two daughters, Cleopatra and Cleomestra. He is the eponym of Troy, also named &quot;Ilion&quot; for his son Ilus. Tros&#x27;s wife was said to be Callirrhoe, daughter of the river god Scamander, or Acallaris, daughter of Eumedes.

Another Tros was a Trojan warrior. According to Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, he is the son of the Lycian Alastor and he was slain by Achilles.

== Genealogy ==

=== Homer&#x27;s account ===
The following excerpts from Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; recounts Tros&#x27; ancestors and descendants:

: Howbeit, if thou wilt, hear this also, that thou mayest know well my lineage, and many there be that know it: at the first Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, begat Dardanus, and he founded Dardania, for not yet was sacred Ilios builded in the plain to be a city of mortal men, but they still dwelt upon the slopes of many-fountained Ida. And Dardanus in turn begat a son, king Erichthonius, who became richest of mortal men. Three thousand steeds had he that pastured in the marsh-land; mares were they. rejoicing in their tender foals. Of these as they grazed the North Wind became enamoured, and he likened himself to a dark-maned stallion and covered them; and they conceived, and bare twelve fillies These, when they bounded over the earth, the giver of grain, would course over the topmost ears of ripened corn and break them not, and whenso they bounded over the broad back of the sea, would course over the topmost breakers of the hoary brine. And Erichthonius begat Tros to be king among the Trojans, and from Tros again three peerless sons were born, Ilus, and Assaracus, and godlike Ganymedes that was born the fairest of mortal men; wherefore the gods caught him up on high to be cupbearer to Zeus by reason of his beauty, that he might dwell with the immortals. And Ilus again begat a son, peerless Laomedon, and Laomedon begat Tithonus and Priam and Clytius, and Hicetaon, scion of Ares. And Assaracus begat Capys, and he Anchises; but Anchises begat me and Priam goodly Hector. This then is the lineage amid the blood wherefrom I avow me sprung.

=== Apollodorus&#x27; account ===
The ancient author Apollodorus in his book, &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, also gives Tros&#x27; lineage:

: And he (i.e. Dardanus) had sons born to him, Ilus and Erichthonius, of whom Ilus died childless, and Erichthonius succeeded to the kingdom and marrying Astyoche, daughter of Simoeis, begat Tros. On succeeding to the kingdom, Tros called the country Troy after himself, and marrying Callirrhoe, daughter of Scamander, he begat a daughter Cleopatra, and sons, Ilus, Assaracus, and Ganymede. This Ganymede, for the sake of his beauty, Zeus caught up on an eagle and appointed him cupbearer of the gods in heaven; and Assaracus had by his wife Hieromneme, daughter of Simoeis, a son Capys; and Capys had by his wife Themiste, daughter of Ilus, a son Anchises, whom Aphrodite met in love&#x27;s dalliance, and to whom she bore Aeneas and Lyrus, who died childless.

=== Dionysius of Halicarnassus ===
Another writer, named Dionysius of Halicarnassus, wrote a passage about Tros&#x27; ancestry that gives us back to Dardanus proving that the Trojan race was indeed of Greek origin.

: But the subject requires that I relate also how Aeneas was descended: this, too, I shall do briefly. Dardanus, after the death of Chrysê, the daughter of Pallas, by whom he had his first sons, married Bateia, the daughter of Teucer, and by her had Erichthonius, who is said to have been the most fortunate of all men, since he inherited both the kingdom of his father and that of his maternal grandfather. Of Erichthonius and Callirrhoê, the daughter of Scamander, was born Tros, from whom the nation has received its name; of Tros and Acallaris, the daughter of Eumedes, Assaracus; of Assaracus and Clytodora, the daughter of Laomedon, Capys; of Capys and a Naiad nymph, Hieromnemê, Anchises; of Anchises and Aphroditê, Aeneas.

== Mythology ==
When Zeus abducted Ganymedes, Tros grieved for his son. Sympathetic, Zeus sent Hermes with a pair of fine horses so swift they could run &quot;over water and standing airs of grain&quot;, &quot;the same that carry the immortals&quot;. Hermes also assured Tros that Ganymede was immortal and would be the cupbearer of the gods, a position of great distinction.

In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, Book V, 265 the described the horses given by Zeus to Tros as a compensation for his abduction of the youth:

: As for these twain, their swift horses shall not bear both back from us again, even if one or the other escape. And another thing will I tell thee, and do thou lay it to heart. If so be Athene, rich in counsel, shall vouchsafe me this glory, to slay them both, then do thou hold here these swift horses, binding the reins taut to the chariot rim; but be mindful to rush upon the horses of Aeneas and drive them forth from the Trojans to the host of the well-greaved Achaeans. For they are of that stock where from Zeus, whose voice is borne afar, gave to Tros recompense for his son Ganymedes, for that they were the best of all horses that are beneath the dawn and the sun. Of this stock the king of men Anchises stole a breed, putting his mares to them while Laomedon knew naught thereof. And from these a stock of six was born him in his palace; four he kept himself and reared at the stall, and the other two he gave to Aeneas, devisers of rout. Could we but take these twain, we should win us goodly renown.

In variant versions, Ganymede is son of Laomedon son of Ilus son of Tros; however, others call him son of Ilus, Erichthonius or Assaracus.

It was from Tros that the Dardanians were called Trojans and the land named the Troad.

<doc id="81511" wikidata="Q752034" url="?curid=81511" title="Stall (fluid dynamics)">
<text>In fluid dynamics, a stall is a reduction in the lift coefficient generated by a foil as angle of attack exceeds its critical value. The critical angle of attack is typically about 15°, but it may vary significantly depending on the fluid, foil – including its shape, size, and finish – and Reynolds number.

Stalls in fixed-wing aircraft are often experienced as a sudden reduction in lift. It may be caused either by the pilot increasing the wing&#x27;s angle of attack or by a decrease in the critical angle of attack. The latter may be due to slowing down (below stall speed) or the accretion of ice on the wings (especially if the ice is rough). A stall does not mean that the engine(s) have stopped working, or that the aircraft has stopped moving—the effect is the same even in an unpowered glider aircraft. Vectored thrust in aircraft is used to maintain altitude or controlled flight with wings stalled by replacing lost wing lift with engine or propeller thrust, thereby giving rise to post-stall technology.

Because stalls are most commonly discussed in connection with aviation, this article discusses stalls as they relate mainly to aircraft, in particular fixed-wing aircraft. The principles of stall discussed here translate to foils in other fluids as well.

==Formal definition==
A stall is a condition in aerodynamics and aviation such that if the angle of attack on an aircraft increases beyond a certain point, then lift begins to decrease. The angle at which this occurs is called the &quot;critical angle of attack&quot;. If the angle of attack increases beyond the critical value, the lift decreases and the aircraft descends, further increasing the angle of attack and causing further loss of lift. The critical angle of attack is dependent upon the airfoil section or profile of the wing, its planform, its aspect ratio, and other factors, but is typically in the range of 8 to 20 degrees relative to the incoming wind (relative wind) for most subsonic airfoils. The critical angle of attack is the angle of attack on the lift coefficient versus angle-of-attack (Cl~alpha) curve at which the maximum lift coefficient occurs.

Stalling is caused by flow separation which, in turn, is caused by the air flowing against a rising pressure. Whitford describes three types of stall: trailing-edge, leading-edge and thin-aerofoil, each with distinctive Cl~alpha features. For the trailing-edge stall, separation begins at small angles of attack near the trailing edge of the wing while the rest of the flow over the wing remains attached. As angle of attack increases, the separated regions on the top of the wing increase in size as the flow separation moves forward, and this hinders the ability of the wing to create lift. This is shown by the reduction in lift-slope on a Cl~alpha curve as the lift nears its maximum value. The separated flow usually causes buffeting. Beyond the critical angle of attack, separated flow is so dominant that additional increases in angle of attack cause the lift to fall from its peak value.

Piston-engined and early jet transports had very good stall behaviour with pre-stall buffet warning and, if ignored, a straight nose-drop for a natural recovery. Wing developments that came with the introduction of turbo-prop engines introduced unacceptable stall behaviour. Leading-edge developments on high-lift wings, and the introduction of rear-mounted engines and high-set tailplanes on the next generation of jet transports, also introduced unacceptable stall behaviour. The probability of achieving the stall speed inadvertently, a potentially hazardous event, had been calculated, in 1965, at about once in every 100,000 flights, often enough to justify the cost of development of warning devices, such as stick shakers, and devices to automatically provide an adequate nose-down pitch, such as stick pushers.

When the mean angle of attack of the wings is beyond the stall a spin, which is an autorotation of a stalled wing, may develop. A spin follows departures in roll, yaw and pitch from balanced flight. For example, a roll is naturally damped with an unstalled wing, but with wings stalled the damping moment is replaced with a propelling moment.

==Variation of lift with angle of attack==

The graph shows that the greatest amount of lift is produced as the critical angle of attack is reached (which in early-20th century aviation was called the &quot;burble point&quot;). This angle is 17.5 degrees in this case, but it varies from airfoil to airfoil. In particular, for aerodynamically thick airfoils (thickness to chord ratios of around 10%), the critical angle is higher than with a thin airfoil of the same camber. Symmetric airfoils have lower critical angles (but also work efficiently in inverted flight). The graph shows that, as the angle of attack exceeds the critical angle, the lift produced by the airfoil decreases.

The information in a graph of this kind is gathered using a model of the airfoil in a wind tunnel. Because aircraft models are normally used, rather than full-size machines, special care is needed to make sure that data is taken in the same Reynolds number regime (or scale speed) as in free flight. The separation of flow from the upper wing surface at high angles of attack is quite different at low Reynolds number from that at the high Reynolds numbers of real aircraft. In particular at high Reynolds numbers the flow tends to stay attached to the airfoil for longer because the inertial forces are dominant with respect to the viscous forces which are responsible for the flow separation ultimately leading to the aerodynamic stall. For this reason wind tunnel results carried out at lower speeds and on smaller scale models of the real life counterparts often tend to overestimate the aerodynamic stall angle of attack. High-pressure wind tunnels are one solution to this problem.

In general, steady operation of an aircraft at an angle of attack above the critical angle is not possible because, after exceeding the critical angle, the loss of lift from the wing causes the nose of the aircraft to fall, reducing the angle of attack again. This nose drop, independent of control inputs, indicates the pilot has actually stalled the aircraft.

This graph shows the stall angle, yet in practice most pilot operating handbooks (POH) or generic flight manuals describe stalling in terms of airspeed. This is because all aircraft are equipped with an airspeed indicator, but fewer aircraft have an angle of attack indicator. An aircraft&#x27;s stalling speed is published by the manufacturer (and is required for certification by flight testing) for a range of weights and flap positions, but the stalling angle of attack is not published.

As speed reduces, angle of attack has to increase to keep lift constant until the critical angle is reached. The airspeed at which this angle is reached is the (1g, unaccelerated) stalling speed of the aircraft in that particular configuration. Deploying flaps/slats decreases the stall speed to allow the aircraft to take off and land at a lower speed.

==Aerodynamic description==
===Fixed-wing aircraft===
A fixed-wing aircraft can be made to stall in any pitch attitude or bank angle or at any airspeed but deliberate stalling is commonly practiced by reducing the speed to the unaccelerated stall speed, at a safe altitude. Unaccelerated (1g) stall speed varies on different fixed-wing aircraft and is represented by colour codes on the airspeed indicator. As the plane flies at this speed, the angle of attack must be increased to prevent any loss of altitude or gain in airspeed (which corresponds to the stall angle described above). The pilot will notice the flight controls have become less responsive and may also notice some buffeting, a result of the turbulent air separated from the wing hitting the tail of the aircraft.

In most light aircraft, as the stall is reached, the aircraft will start to descend (because the wing is no longer producing enough lift to support the aircraft&#x27;s weight) and the nose will pitch down. Recovery from the stall involves lowering the aircraft nose, to decrease the angle of attack and increase the air speed, until smooth air-flow over the wing is restored. Normal flight can be resumed once recovery is complete. The maneuver is normally quite safe, and, if correctly handled, leads to only a small loss in altitude (). It is taught and practised in order for pilots to recognize, avoid, and recover from stalling the aircraft. A pilot is required to demonstrate competency in controlling an aircraft during and after a stall for certification in the United States, and it is a routine maneuver for pilots when getting to know the handling of an unfamiliar aircraft type. The only dangerous aspect of a stall is a lack of altitude for recovery.
A special form of asymmetric stall in which the aircraft also rotates about its yaw axis is called a spin. A spin can occur if an aircraft is stalled and there is an asymmetric yawing moment applied to it. This yawing moment can be aerodynamic (sideslip angle, rudder, adverse yaw from the ailerons), thrust related (p-factor, one engine inoperative on a multi-engine non-centreline thrust aircraft), or from less likely sources such as severe turbulence. The net effect is that one wing is stalled before the other and the aircraft descends rapidly while rotating, and some aircraft cannot recover from this condition without correct pilot control inputs (which must stop yaw) and loading. A new solution to the problem of difficult (or impossible) stall-spin recovery is provided by the ballistic parachute recovery system.

The most common stall-spin scenarios occur on takeoff (departure stall) and during landing (base to final turn) because of insufficient airspeed during these maneuvers. Stalls also occur during a go-around manoeuvre if the pilot does not properly respond to the out-of-trim situation resulting from the transition from low power setting to high power setting at low speed. Stall speed is increased when the wing surfaces are contaminated with ice or frost creating a rougher surface, and heavier airframe due to ice accumulation.

Stalls occur not only at slow airspeed, but at any speed when the wings exceed their critical angle of attack. Attempting to increase the angle of attack at 1g by moving the control column back normally causes the aircraft to climb. However, aircraft often experience higher g-forces, such as when turning steeply or pulling out of a dive. In these cases, the wings are already operating at a higher angle of attack to create the necessary force (derived from lift) to accelerate in the desired direction. Increasing the g-loading still further, by pulling back on the controls, can cause the stalling angle to be exceeded, even though the aircraft is flying at a high speed. These &quot;high-speed stalls&quot; produce the same buffeting characteristics as 1g stalls and can also initiate a spin if there is also any yawing.

===Characteristics===
Different aircraft types have different stalling characteristics but they only have to be good enough to satisfy their particular Airworthiness authority. For example, the Short Belfast heavy freighter had a marginal nose drop which was acceptable to the Royal Air Force. When the aircraft were sold to a civil operator they had to be fitted with a stick pusher to meet the civil requirements. Some aircraft may naturally have very good behaviour well beyond what is required. For example, first generation jet transports have been described as having an immaculate nose drop at the stall. Loss of lift on one wing is acceptable as long as the roll, including during stall recovery, doesn&#x27;t exceed about 20 degrees, or in turning flight the roll shall not exceed 90 degrees bank. If pre-stall warning followed by nose drop and limited wing drop are naturally not present or are deemed to be unacceptably marginal by an Airworthiness authority the stalling behaviour has to be made good enough with airframe modifications or devices such as a stick shaker and pusher. These are described in &quot;Warning and safety devices&quot;.

==Stall speeds==

Stalls depend only on angle of attack, not airspeed. However, the slower an aircraft flies, the greater the angle of attack it needs to produce lift equal to the aircraft&#x27;s weight. As the speed decreases further, at some point this angle will be equal to the critical (stall) angle of attack. This speed is called the &quot;stall speed&quot;. An aircraft flying at its stall speed cannot climb, and an aircraft flying below its stall speed cannot stop descending. Any attempt to do so by increasing angle of attack, without first increasing airspeed, will result in a stall.

The actual stall speed will vary depending on the airplane&#x27;s weight, altitude, configuration, and vertical and lateral acceleration. Propeller slipstream reduces the stall speed by energizing the flow over the wings.

Speed definitions vary and include:
* VS: Stall speed: the speed at which the airplane exhibits those qualities accepted as defining the stall.
* VS0: The stall speed or minimum steady flight speed in landing configuration. The zero-thrust stall speed at the most extended landing flap setting.
* VS1: The stall speed or minimum steady flight speed obtained in a specified configuration. The zero thrust stall speed at a specified flap setting.

An airspeed indicator, for the purpose of flight-testing, may have the following markings: the bottom of the white arc indicates VS0 at maximum weight, while the bottom of the green arc indicates VS1 at maximum weight. While an aircraft&#x27;s VS speed is computed by design, its VS0 and VS1 speeds must be demonstrated empirically by flight testing.

==In accelerated and turning flight==

The normal stall speed, specified by the VS values above, always refers to straight and level flight, where the load factor is equal to 1g. However, if the aircraft is turning or pulling up from a dive, additional lift is required to provide the vertical or lateral acceleration, and so the stall speed is higher. An accelerated stall is a stall that occurs under such conditions.

In a banked turn, the lift required is equal to the weight of the aircraft plus extra lift to provide the centripetal force necessary to perform the turn:
:formula_1

where:
:formula_2 = lift
:formula_3 = load factor (greater than 1 in a turn)
:formula_4 = weight of the aircraft

To achieve the extra lift, the lift coefficient, and so the angle of attack, will have to be higher than it would be in straight and level flight at the same speed. Therefore, given that the stall always occurs at the same critical angle of attack, by increasing the load factor (e.g. by tightening the turn) the critical angle will be reached at a higher airspeed:
:formula_5

where:
:formula_6 = stall speed
:formula_7 = stall speed of the aircraft in straight, level flight
:formula_3 = load factor

The table that follows gives some examples of the relation between the angle of bank and the square root of the load factor. It derives from the trigonometric relation (secant) between formula_2 and formula_4.

For example, in a turn with bank angle of 45°, Vst is 19% higher than Vs.

According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) terminology, the above example illustrates a so-called turning flight stall, while the term &quot;accelerated&quot; is used to indicate an &quot;accelerated turning stall&quot; only, that is, a turning flight stall where the airspeed decreases at a given rate.

The tendency of powerful propeller aircraft to roll in reaction to engine torque creates a risk of accelerated stalls. When an aircraft such as a Mitsubishi MU-2 is flying close to its stall speed, the sudden application of full power may cause it to roll, creating the same aerodynamic conditions that induce an accelerated stall in turning flight even if the pilot did not deliberately initiate a turn. Pilots of such aircraft are trained to avoid sudden and drastic increases in power at low altitude and low airspeed as it may be difficult to recover from an accelerated stall under these conditions.

A notable example of an air accident involving a low-altitude turning flight stall is the 1994 Fairchild Air Force Base B-52 crash.

==Types==

===Dynamic stall===

Dynamic stall is a non-linear unsteady aerodynamic effect that occurs when airfoils rapidly change the angle of attack. The rapid change can cause a strong vortex to be shed from the leading edge of the aerofoil, and travel backwards above the wing. The vortex, containing high-velocity airflows, briefly increases the lift produced by the wing. As soon as it passes behind the trailing edge, however, the lift reduces dramatically, and the wing is in normal stall.

Dynamic stall is an effect most associated with helicopters and flapping wings, though also occurs in wind turbines, and due to gusting airflow. During forward flight, some regions of a helicopter blade may incur flow that reverses (compared to the direction of blade movement), and thus includes rapidly changing angles of attack. Oscillating (flapping) wings, such as those of insects like the bumblebee—may rely almost entirely on dynamic stall for lift production, provided the oscillations are fast compared to the speed of flight, and the angle of the wing changes rapidly compared to airflow direction.

Stall delay can occur on airfoils subject to a high angle of attack and a three-dimensional flow. When the angle of attack on an airfoil is increasing rapidly, the flow will remain substantially attached to the airfoil to a significantly higher angle of attack than can be achieved in steady-state conditions. As a result, the stall is delayed momentarily and a lift coefficient significantly higher than the steady-state maximum is achieved. The effect was first noticed on propellers.

===Deep stall===
A &quot;deep stall&quot; (or &quot;super-stall&quot;) is a dangerous type of stall that affects certain aircraft designs, notably jet aircraft with a T-tail configuration and rear-mounted engines. In these designs, the turbulent wake of a stalled main wing, nacelle-pylon wakes and the wake from the fuselage &quot;blanket&quot; the horizontal stabilizer, rendering the elevators ineffective and preventing the aircraft from recovering from the stall. Aircraft with rear-mounted nacelles may also exhibit a loss of thrust. T-tail propeller aircraft are generally resistant to deep stalls, because the prop wash increases airflow over the wing root, but may be fitted with a precautionary vertical tail booster during flight testing, as happened with the A400M.

Trubshaw gives a broad definition of deep stall as penetrating to such angles of attack formula_11 that pitch control effectiveness is reduced by the wing and nacelle wakes. He also gives a definition that relates deep stall to a locked-in condition where recovery is impossible. This is a single value of formula_11, for a given aircraft configuration, where there is no pitching moment, i.e. a trim point.

Typical values both for the range of deep stall, as defined above, and the locked-in trim point are given for the Douglas DC-9 Series 10 by Schaufele. These values are from wind-tunnel tests for an early design. The final design had no locked-in trim point, so recovery from the deep stall region was possible, as required to meet certification rules. Normal stall beginning at the &quot;g break&quot; (sudden decrease of the vertical load factor) was at formula_13, deep stall started at about 30°, and the locked-in unrecoverable trim point was at 47°.

The very high formula_11 for a deep stall locked-in condition occurs well beyond the normal stall but can be attained very rapidly, as the aircraft is unstable beyond the normal stall and requires immediate action to arrest it. The loss of lift causes high sink rates, which, together with the low forward speed at the normal stall, give a high formula_11 with little or no rotation of the aircraft. BAC 1-11 G-ASHG, during stall flight tests before the type was modified to prevent a locked-in deep-stall condition, descended at over and struck the ground in a flat attitude moving only forward after initial impact. Sketches showing how the wing wake blankets the tail may be misleading if they imply that deep stall requires a high body angle. Taylor and Ray show how the aircraft attitude in the deep stall is relatively flat, even less than during the normal stall, with very high negative flight-path angles.

Effects similar to deep stall had been known to occur on some aircraft designs before the term was coined. A prototype Gloster Javelin (serial &quot;WD808&quot;) was lost in a crash on 11 June 1953 to a &quot;locked-in&quot; stall. However, Waterton states that the trimming tailplane was found to be the wrong way for recovery. Low-speed handling tests were being done to assess a new wing. Handley Page Victor &quot;XL159&quot; was lost to a &quot;stable stall&quot; on 23 March 1962. It had been clearing the fixed droop leading edge with the test being stall approach, landing configuration, C of G aft. The brake parachute had not been streamed, as it may have hindered rear crew escape.

The name &quot;deep stall&quot; first came into widespread use after the crash of the prototype BAC 1-11 G-ASHG on 22 October 1963, which killed its crew. This led to changes to the aircraft, including the installation of a stick shaker (see below) to clearly warn the pilot of an impending stall. Stick shakers are now a standard part of commercial airliners. Nevertheless, the problem continues to cause accidents; on 3 June 1966, a Hawker Siddeley Trident (G-ARPY), was lost to deep stall; deep stall is suspected to be cause of another Trident (the British European Airways Flight 548 &quot;G-ARPI&quot;) crash – known as the &quot;Staines Disaster&quot; – on 18 June 1972, when the crew failed to notice the conditions and had disabled the stall-recovery system. On 3 April 1980, a prototype of the Canadair Challenger business jet crashed after initially entering a deep stall from 17,000 ft and having both engines flame-out. It recovered from the deep stall after deploying the anti-spin parachute but crashed after being unable to jettison the chute or relight the engines. One of the test pilots was unable to escape from the aircraft in time and was killed. On 26 July 1993, a Canadair CRJ-100 was lost in flight testing due to a deep stall. It has been reported that a Boeing 727 entered a deep stall in a flight test, but the pilot was able to rock the airplane to increasingly higher bank angles until the nose finally fell through and normal control response was recovered. The crash of West Caribbean Airways Flight 708 in 2005 was also attributed to a deep stall.

Deep stalls can occur at apparently normal pitch attitudes, if the aircraft is descending quickly enough. The airflow is coming from below, so the angle of attack is increased. Early speculation on reasons for the crash of Air France Flight 447 blamed an unrecoverable deep stall, since it descended in an almost flat attitude (15°) at an angle of attack of 35° or more. However, it was held in a stalled glide by the pilots, who held the nose up amid all the confusion of what was actually happening to the aircraft.

Canard-configured aircraft are also at risk of getting into a deep stall. Two Velocity aircraft crashed due to locked-in deep stalls. Testing revealed that the addition of leading-edge cuffs to the outboard wing prevented the aircraft from getting into a deep stall. The Piper Advanced Technologies PAT-1, N15PT, another canard-configured aircraft, also crashed in an accident attributed to a deep stall. Wind-tunnel testing of the design at the NASA Langley Research Center showed that it was vulnerable to a deep stall.

In the early 1980s, a Schweizer SGS 1-36 sailplane was modified for NASA&#x27;s controlled deep-stall flight program.

===Tip stall===
Wing sweep and taper cause stalling at the tip of a wing before the root. The position of a swept wing along the fuselage has to be such that the lift from the wing root, well forward of the aircraft center of gravity (c.g.), must be balanced by the wing tip, well aft of the c.g. If the tip stalls first the balance of the aircraft is upset causing dangerous nose pitch up. Swept wings have to incorporate features which prevent pitch-up caused by premature tip stall.

A swept wing has a higher lift coefficient on its outer panels than on the inner wing, causing them to reach their maximum lift capability first and to stall first. This is caused by the downwash pattern associated with swept/tapered wings. To delay tip stall the outboard wing is given washout to reduce its angle of attack. The root can also be modified with a suitable leading-edge and airfoil section to make sure it stalls before the tip. However, when taken beyond stalling incidence the tips may still become fully stalled before the inner wing despite initial separation occurring inboard. This causes pitch-up after the stall and entry to a super-stall on those aircraft with super-stall characteristics. Span-wise flow of the boundary layer is also present on swept wings and causes tip stall. The amount of boundary layer air flowing outboard can be reduced by generating vortices with a leading-edge device such as a fence, notch, saw tooth or a set of vortex generators behind the leading edge.

==Warning and safety devices==
Fixed-wing aircraft can be equipped with devices to prevent or postpone a stall or to make it less (or in some cases more) severe, or to make recovery easier.
* An aerodynamic twist can be introduced to the wing with the leading edge near the wing tip twisted downward. This is called washout and causes the wing root to stall before the wing tip. This makes the stall gentle and progressive. Since the stall is delayed at the wing tips, where the ailerons are, roll control is maintained when the stall begins.
* A stall strip is a small sharp-edged device that, when attached to the leading edge of a wing, encourages the stall to start there in preference to any other location on the wing. If attached close to the wing root, it makes the stall gentle and progressive; if attached near the wing tip, it encourages the aircraft to drop a wing when stalling.
* A stall fence is a flat plate in the direction of the chord to stop separated flow progressing out along the wing
* Vortex generators, tiny strips of metal or plastic placed on top of the wing near the leading edge that protrude past the boundary layer into the free stream. As the name implies, they energize the boundary layer by mixing free stream airflow with boundary layer flow, thereby creating vortices, this increases the momentum in the boundary layer. By increasing the momentum of the boundary layer, airflow separation and the resulting stall may be delayed.
* An anti-stall strake is a leading edge extension that generates a vortex on the wing upper surface to postpone the stall.
* A stick pusher is a mechanical device that prevents the pilot from stalling an aircraft. It pushes the elevator control forward as the stall is approached, causing a reduction in the angle of attack. In generic terms, a stick pusher is known as a &quot;stall identification device&quot; or &quot;stall identification system&quot;.
* A stick shaker is a mechanical device that shakes the pilot&#x27;s controls to warn of the onset of stall.
* A stall warning is an electronic or mechanical device that sounds an audible warning as the stall speed is approached. The majority of aircraft contain some form of this device that warns the pilot of an impending stall. The simplest such device is a &quot;stall warning horn&quot;, which consists of either a pressure sensor or a movable metal tab that actuates a switch and produces an audible warning in response.
* An angle-of-attack indicator for light aircraft, the &quot;AlphaSystemsAOA&quot; and a nearly identical &quot;lift reserve indicator&quot;, are both pressure-differential instruments that display margin above stall and/or angle of attack on an instantaneous, continuous readout. The General Technics CYA-100 displays true angle of attack via a magnetically coupled vane. An AOA indicator provides a visual display of the amount of available lift throughout its slow-speed envelope regardless of the many variables that act upon an aircraft. This indicator is immediately responsive to changes in speed, angle of attack, and wind conditions, and automatically compensates for aircraft weight, altitude, and temperature.
* An angle of attack limiter or an &quot;alpha limiter&quot; is a flight computer that automatically prevents pilot input from causing the plane to rise over the stall angle. Some alpha limiters can be disabled by the pilot.

Stall warning systems often involve inputs from a broad range of sensors and systems to include a dedicated angle of attack sensor.

Blockage, damage, or inoperation of stall and angle of attack (AOA) probes can lead to unreliability of the stall warning and cause the stick pusher, overspeed warning, autopilot, and yaw damper to malfunction.

If a forward canard is used for pitch control, rather than an aft tail, the canard is designed to meet the airflow at a slightly greater angle of attack than the wing. Therefore, when the aircraft pitch increases abnormally, the canard will usually stall first, causing the nose to drop and so preventing the wing from reaching its critical AOA. Thus, the risk of main-wing stalling is greatly reduced. However, if the main wing stalls, recovery becomes difficult, as the canard is more deeply stalled, and angle of attack increases rapidly.

If an aft tail is used, the wing is designed to stall before the tail. In this case, the wing can be flown at higher lift coefficient (closer to stall) to produce more overall lift.

Most military combat aircraft have an angle of attack indicator among the pilot&#x27;s instruments, which lets the pilot know precisely how close to the stall point the aircraft is. Modern airliner instrumentation may also measure angle of attack, although this information may not be directly displayed on the pilot&#x27;s display, instead driving a stall warning indicator or giving performance information to the flight computer (for fly-by-wire systems).

==Flight beyond the stall==
As a wing stalls, aileron effectiveness is reduced, rendering the plane difficult to control and increasing the risk of a spin. Post stall, steady flight beyond the stalling angle (where the coefficient of lift is largest) requires engine thrust to replace lift, as well as alternative controls to replace the loss of effectiveness of the ailerons. Short-term stalls at 90–120° (e.g. Pugachev&#x27;s cobra) are sometimes performed at airshows. The highest angle of attack in sustained flight so far demonstrated was 70° in the X-31 at the Dryden Flight Research Center. Sustained post-stall flight is a type of supermaneuverability.

==Spoilers==

Except for flight training, airplane testing, and aerobatics, a stall is usually an undesirable event. Spoilers (sometimes called lift dumpers), however, are devices that are intentionally deployed to create a carefully controlled flow separation over part of an aircraft&#x27;s wing to reduce the lift it generates, increase the drag, and allow the aircraft to descend more rapidly without gaining speed. Spoilers are also deployed asymmetrically (one wing only) to enhance roll control. Spoilers can also be used on aborted take-offs and after main wheel contact on landing to increase the aircraft&#x27;s weight on its wheels for better braking action.

Unlike powered airplanes, which can control descent by increasing or decreasing thrust, gliders have to increase drag to increase the rate of descent. In high-performance gliders, spoiler deployment is extensively used to control the approach to landing.

Spoilers can also be thought of as &quot;lift reducers&quot; because they reduce the lift of the wing in which the spoiler resides. For example, an uncommanded roll to the left could be reversed by raising the right wing spoiler (or only a few of the spoilers present in large airliner wings). This has the advantage of avoiding the need to increase lift in the wing that is dropping (which may bring that wing closer to stalling).

==History==
German aviator Otto Lilienthal died while flying in 1896 as the result of a stall. Wilbur Wright encountered stalls for the first time in 1901, while flying his second glider. Awareness of Lilienthal&#x27;s accident and Wilbur&#x27;s experience motivated the Wright Brothers to design their plane in &quot;canard&quot; configuration. This purportedly made recoveries from stalls easier and more gentle. The design allegedly saved the brothers&#x27; lives more than once. Although, canard configurations, without careful design, can actually make a stall unrecoverable.

The aircraft engineer Juan de la Cierva worked on his &quot;Autogiro&quot; project to develop a rotary wing aircraft which, he hoped, would be unable to stall and which therefore would be safer than aeroplanes. In developing the resulting &quot;autogyro&quot; aircraft, he solved many engineering problems which made the helicopter possible.

<doc id="81512" wikidata="Q828530" url="?curid=81512" title="Bertie Wooster">
<text>Bertram Wilberforce Wooster is a fictional character in the comedic Jeeves stories created by British author P. G. Wodehouse. An amiable English gentleman and one of the &quot;idle rich&quot;, Bertie appears alongside his valet, Jeeves, whose intelligence manages to save Bertie or one of his friends from numerous awkward situations. Bertie Wooster and Jeeves have been described as &quot;one of the great comic double-acts of all time&quot;.

Bertie is the narrator and central figure of most of the Jeeves short stories and novels. The two exceptions are the short story &quot;Bertie Changes His Mind&quot; (1922), which is narrated by Jeeves, and the novel &quot;Ring for Jeeves&quot; (1953), a third-person narration in which Bertie is mentioned but does not appear. First appearing in &quot;Extricating Young Gussie&quot; in 1915, Bertie is the narrator of ten novels and over 30 short stories, his last appearance being in the novel &quot;Aunts Aren&#x27;t Gentlemen&quot;, published in 1974.

==Inspiration==

The Wodehouse scholar Norman Murphy believes George Grossmith Jr. to have been the inspiration for the character of Bertie Wooster. Others have asserted John Wodehouse, 3rd Earl of Kimberley was the inspiration. P. G. Wodehouse was a distant cousin of John Wodehouse. He was also the godfather to the 3rd Earl&#x27;s son, John Wodehouse, 4th Earl of Kimberley.

The Wodehouse character Reggie Pepper was an early prototype of Bertie Wooster.

==Fictional biography==
===Early life===

Bertie Wooster and his friend Bingo Little were born in the same village only a few days apart. Bertie&#x27;s middle name, &quot;Wilberforce&quot;, is the doing of his father, who won money on a horse named Wilberforce in the Grand National the day before Bertie&#x27;s christening and insisted on his son carrying that name. The only other piece of information given about Bertie&#x27;s father, aside from the fact that he had numerous relatives, is that he was a great friend of Lord Wickhammersley of Twing Hall. Bertie refers to his father as the &quot;guv&#x27;nor&quot;, and seems to have had a friendly relationship with him.

When he was around seven years of age, Bertie was sometimes compelled to recite &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; for guests by his mother; she proclaimed that he recited nicely, but Bertie disagrees, and says that he and others found the experience unpleasant. Bertie also mentions reciting other poems as a child, including &quot;Ben Battle&quot; and works by Walter Scott. Like Jeeves, Bertie says that his mother thought him intelligent. Bertie makes no other mention of his mother, though he makes a remark about motherhood after being astounded by a friend telling a blatant lie: &quot;And this, mark you, a man who had had a good upbringing and had, no doubt, spent years at his mother&#x27;s knee being taught to tell the truth.&quot;

When Bertie was eight years old, he took dancing lessons (alongside Corky Potter-Pirbright, sister of Bertie&#x27;s friend Catsmeat Potter-Pirbright). It is established throughout the series that Bertie is an orphan who inherited a large fortune at some point, although the exact details and timing of his parents&#x27; deaths are never made clear.

===Education===

Bertie Wooster&#x27;s early education took place at the semi-fictional Malvern House Preparatory School, headed by Rev. Aubrey Upjohn, whom he meets again in &quot;Jeeves in the Offing&quot;. (Wodehouse himself attended a school by that name, in Kearsney, Kent, but the Malvern House that appears in the stories is in the fictional town of Bramley-on-Sea.) At Malvern House, Bertie&#x27;s friends called him &quot;Daredevil Bertie&quot;, though Upjohn and others called him &quot;Bungling Wooster&quot;.

One detail of Bertie&#x27;s Malvern House life that comes into several stories is his winning of the prize for scripture knowledge. Bertie speaks with pride of this achievement on several occasions, but in &quot;Right Ho, Jeeves&quot;, his friend Gussie Fink-Nottle, while intoxicated, publicly accuses Bertie of having won the award by cheating. Bertie stoutly denies this charge, however, and on the same occasion, Gussie makes other completely groundless accusations against other characters. Despite his pride over his accomplishment, Bertie does not remember precisely what the prize was, simply stating that it was &quot;a handsomely bound copy of a devotional work whose name has escaped me&quot;.

Bertie once won a prize at private school for the best collection of wildflowers made during the summer holidays. When Bertie was fourteen, he won the Choir Boys&#x27; Handicap bicycle race at a local school treat, having received half a lap start.

After Malvern House, Bertie was further educated at the non-fictional Eton and at Magdalen College, Oxford. At Oxford he was a Rackets Blue.

Bertie is a member of the Drones Club, and most of his friends and fellow Drones members depicted in the stories attended one or both of these institutions with him. It was at Oxford that he first began celebrating the night of the annual Boat Race between Oxford and Cambridge. Though ordinarily he drinks in moderation, Bertie says he is &quot;rather apt to let myself go a bit&quot; on Boat Race night, typically drinking more than usual and making mischief with his old school friends. Specifically, Bertie and others tend to celebrate the occasion by stealing a policeman&#x27;s helmet, though they often get arrested as a result. London magistrates are aware of this tradition and tend to be lenient towards Bertie when he appears in court the morning after the Boat Race, generally only imposing a fine of five pounds; while this would have constituted a significant amount of money for many people at the time, Bertie has no trouble paying it.

===The stories===
The Jeeves canon is set in a floating timeline (with each story being set at the time when it was written though the characters do not age), in an idealized world where wars are downplayed or not mentioned. Certain Edwardian era elements, such as traditional gentlemen&#x27;s clubs like the Drones Club, continue to be prevalent throughout the stories.

With a few exceptions, the short stories were written first, followed by the novels. The saga begins chronologically in the short story &quot;Jeeves Takes Charge&quot;, in which Bertie Wooster first hires Jeeves. Bertie and Jeeves usually live at Berkeley Mansions, though they also go to New York and numerous English country houses. Throughout the short stories and novels, Bertie tries to help his friends and relatives, but ends up becoming entangled in trouble himself, and is ultimately rescued by Jeeves. Typically, Bertie has a new piece of clothing or item that Jeeves disapproves of, though Bertie agrees to relinquish it at the end of the story.

Almost always narrating the story, Bertie becomes involved in many complex and absurd situations. He appears in the one short story he does not narrate, &quot;Bertie Changes His Mind&quot;, and does not make an appearance in &quot;Ring for Jeeves&quot;, though he is mentioned. An important story for Bertie is &quot;Clustering Round Young Bingo&quot;, in which Bertie writes an article titled &quot;What the Well-Dressed Man is Wearing&quot; for his Aunt Dahlia&#x27;s weekly magazine, &quot;Milady&#x27;s Boudoir&quot;. For his article, Aunt Dahlia paid Bertie a packet of cigarettes. As with his prize for scripture knowledge, Bertie is proud of this article and mentions it many times. Two other events that are particularly significant for Bertie are his short-lived interest in living with his nieces in &quot;Bertie Changes His Mind&quot; and his temporary separation from Jeeves when Bertie refused to stop playing his banjolele in &quot;Thank You, Jeeves&quot;.

On several occasions, Bertie assumes an alias. After being arrested on Boat Race night, he calls himself Eustace H. Plimsoll when appearing in court (in &quot;Thank You, Jeeves&quot; and &quot;Right Ho, Jeeves&quot;). He is also brought to court after tripping a policeman in &quot;Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit&quot;, and calls himself Ephraim Gadsby. In one scene in &quot;Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves&quot;, he is said to be a thief named Alpine Joe, which is mentioned again in &quot;Aunts Aren&#x27;t Gentlemen&quot;. He also impersonates three other people in different stories, namely Rosie M. Banks in &quot;Jeeves in the Springtime&quot; and &quot;Bingo and the Little Woman&quot;, Oliver &quot;Sippy&quot; Sipperley in &quot;Without the Option&quot;, and Gussie Fink-Nottle in &quot;The Mating Season&quot;.

In &quot;Ring for Jeeves&quot;, set in post-WWII England, Bertie attends a school that teaches the aristocracy basic skills, including boot-cleaning, sock-darning, bed-making and primary-grade cooking. This school does not allow its students to employ valets, so Jeeves cannot follow Bertie there and instead works as a butler for Lord Rowcester. However, Bertie is eventually expelled for cheating after he pays a woman to do his sock darning, and Jeeves returns to his side.

==Personal characteristics==
===Age and appearance===

Bertie is approximately 24 years old when he first meets Jeeves in &quot;Jeeves Takes Charge&quot;, first published in 1916. His age is not stated in any other story. In the reference work &quot;Wodehouse in Woostershire&quot; by Wodehouse scholars Geoffrey Jaggard and Tony Ring, it is speculated that Bertie&#x27;s age ranges from approximately 24 to 29 over the course of the stories. Nigel Cawthorne, author of &quot;A Brief Guide to Jeeves and Wooster&quot;, also suggested that Bertie is approximately 29 at the end of the saga.

Tall and slim, Bertie is elegantly dressed, largely because of Jeeves, who tends to talk Bertie out of the more flamboyant articles of clothing that Bertie sometimes favours. He has blue eyes. Normally clean-shaven, he grows a moustache in two different stories, and ultimately loses the moustache, as Jeeves does not think a moustache suits Bertie. It seems that he has an innocent-looking appearance; when Bertie wants to wear an alpine hat in &quot;Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves&quot;, he states, &quot;I was prepared to concede that it would have been more suitable for rural wear, but against this had to be set the fact that it unquestionably lent a &quot;diablerie&quot; to my appearance, and mine is an appearance that needs all the &quot;diablerie&quot; it can get.&quot; Bertie has an expressive face that Jeeves can read easily.

In illustrations, Bertie Wooster has frequently been depicted wearing a monocle. However, this is probably merely a stereotypical depiction of an upper-class gentleman, as Bertie does not seem to wear a monocle in the original stories. The only evidence of Bertie wearing a monocle occurs in &quot;The Spot of Art&quot;, when Bertie sees a portrait of himself, wearing a monocle, in a poster advertising soup. Bertie is revolted by the image, which gives him a look of &quot;bestial greed&quot;. The monocle seems to exaggerate this expression, and Bertie makes fun of how large the monocle looks, calling it &quot;about six inches in circumference&quot;. Bertie is never described as wearing a monocle elsewhere. It is unlikely that Bertie would wear a monocle that would not be mentioned, since the glasses of other characters, particularly Bertie&#x27;s friend Gussie Fink-Nottle, are well-described, and another prominent Wodehouse character, Psmith, has a distinctive monocle that is mentioned many times.

===Personality===

Bertie is pleasant and amiable, according to Jeeves. A well-intentioned and honorable young gentleman, he has a strong moral code and prides himself on helping his friends. Unlike his Aunt Agatha, he is not snobbish to servants and is not bothered when one of his pals wants to marry someone from a different social class. He gladly spends time with a variety of people, including rich aristocrats and poor artists.

Tending to be unworldly and naive, Bertie is tricked by con artists in &quot;Aunt Agatha Takes the Count&quot; and &quot;Jeeves and the Greasy Bird&quot;, though Jeeves could have warned him earlier on during the former occasion and he was driven by desperation in the latter circumstances; in &quot;Aunts Aren&#x27;t Gentlemen&quot;, he realises he is being tricked by a man named Graham, but is unable to avoid paying Graham anyway. He is not interested in global affairs or politics, and advises Jeeves to miss as many political debates as possible in order to live a happy and prosperous life. Usually modest about his intelligence, Bertie states, &quot;I know perfectly well that I&#x27;ve got, roughly speaking, half the amount of brain a normal bloke ought to possess&quot;, though he occasionally wants to prove his intelligence, for example in &quot;Scoring off Jeeves&quot;. He comes up with well-intentioned if ill-advised or unfortunately botched schemes, such as when he decides to kiss Pauline Stoker to spur his friend Chuffy to propose to her in &quot;Thank You, Jeeves&quot;.

Sometimes, Bertie acts diffidently, giving in to the whims of his formidable aunts or fiancées, but there are also times when Bertie displays a strong will, for example when he attempts to defy Jeeves&#x27;s wishes on clothing, and when he resolves to confront Aunt Agatha at the end of &quot;The Mating Season&quot;. Nonetheless, Bertie lacks what Jeeves calls &quot;Presence&quot; and has difficulty presenting himself with authority in front of an audience. On two occasions, Bertie mentions reluctantly playing a part in an amateur theatrical production at a country house, once when roped into playing a butler, and another time when compelled to play King Edward III at his Aunt Agatha&#x27;s house; for Bertie, both times were a trying ordeal.

By no means an ambitious man, Bertie seeks neither a prestigious job nor a socially advantageous marriage; it is implied throughout the series that his inheritance means he need not pursue either course. In his own words, Bertie is the sort of person who is &quot;content just to exist beautifully&quot;. He likes living a leisurely, quiet life and appreciates small things in his day, such as the oolong tea (which he sometimes calls Bohea) that Jeeves brings to him every morning.

===Hobbies===

Bertie participates in a number of physical activities. He likes swimming under ordinary circumstances; he is less fond of it when he falls into water unexpectedly while dressed in regular attire, which occurs multiple times in the stories. He plays tennis with Bingo Little in &quot;Jeeves and the Impending Doom&quot;. Bertie also plays golf in the same story. His golf handicap is 16, and he plays in the Drones Club golf tournament every year. At Oxford, he obtained a blue for rackets playing with his friend Harold &quot;Beefy&quot; Anstruther, and briefly went in for rowing under the coaching of Stilton Cheesewright. Later, he rows a boat that Jeeves is steering in &quot;Jeeves and the Impending Doom&quot;. Bertie plays squash and was runner-up one year in the Drones Club Annual Squash Handicap. There is no doubt in his mind that he will win the Drones Club darts competition in &quot;Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit&quot;. Claiming that he can &quot;out-Fred the nimblest Astaire&quot; Bertie enjoys dancing and likes fancy dress balls.

Capable of reading sheet music, Bertie has a light baritone voice and sings often, most prominently in &quot;Jeeves and the Song of Songs&quot;. He keeps a piano in his flat, and once played &quot;Happy Days Are Here Again&quot; with one finger on the piano at Totleigh Towers when there was no other method of self-expression available. In &quot;Thank You, Jeeves&quot;, he attempts to play the banjolele, apparently with little success despite his enthusiasm. In an early story, Bertie claims that &quot;bar a weekly wrestle with the &#x27;Pink &#x27;Un&#x27; and an occasional dip into the form book I&#x27;m not much of a lad for reading&quot;, yet Bertie is frequently in the middle of reading a mystery or crime novel in later stories. He states that he is never happier than when curled up with the latest Agatha Christie, and regularly references literary characters in mystery and crime fiction, including Christie&#x27;s Hercule Poirot and others such as Sherlock Holmes, A. J. Raffles, and Nero Wolfe.

==Relationships==
===Jeeves===

When Bertie Wooster catches his valet Meadowes stealing his silk socks among other things, he sacks him and sends for another from the agency. Jeeves arrives and mixes Bertie a hangover cure. The cure is remarkably effective, and Bertie engages Jeeves immediately. Thereafter, Bertie happily cedes much of the control of his life to the competent Jeeves, despite the occasional clashes that sometimes occur &quot;when two men of iron will live in close association&quot;, according to Bertie. These clashes generally occur because Bertie insists on wearing a new jacket, tie, or some other item that Jeeves disapproves of, though Bertie invariably agrees to give up the item after Jeeves saves him from trouble.

===Family===
Due to the volume of stories and time span over which Wodehouse wrote them, there are a number of inconsistencies and contradictions in the information given about his relatives. Bertie and several of his relations appear in the early semi-canonical short story &quot;Extricating Young Gussie&quot;. In that story the family name is Mannering-Phipps, not Wooster, and the story has been excluded from most collections of Jeeves and Wooster material, even though the incidents in that story are referenced in later stories.

The family members who make an appearance in the most Jeeves stories are Bertie&#x27;s Aunt Dahlia (7 short stories, 7 novels) and Aunt Agatha (8 short stories). Aunt Dahlia is friendly and good-natured while Aunt Agatha is cold and haughty, though both make demands of Bertie. Bertie feels obliged to follow their whims, often getting in trouble doing so. Aunt Dahlia&#x27;s husband Tom Travers and children Angela and Bonzo Travers play important roles. Spenser Gregson, Aunt Agatha&#x27;s first husband, does not play a major role, but their son Thomas &quot;Thos&quot; Gregson and later her second husband Percy Craye, Earl of Worplesdon appear in the stories.

Aside from Aunts Dahlia and Agatha, Bertie Wooster&#x27;s father had other siblings. In &quot;Extricating Young Gussie&quot;, Bertie&#x27;s Uncle Cuthbert is described as the &quot;late head of the family&quot;, but it is said his son Gussie has no title; Cuthbert&#x27;s widow is Bertie&#x27;s Aunt Julia. Another uncle is Uncle Willoughby, upon whom Bertie is initially financially dependent. One of Bertie&#x27;s uncles, the late Henry Wooster, was the husband of Bertie&#x27;s Aunt Emily; Claude and Eustace are their twin sons and Bertie&#x27;s cousins. In &quot;The Rummy Affair of Old Biffy&quot;, Bertie takes a present for another of Aunt Emily&#x27;s sons, Harold, who has just turned six, but, embarrassed at the relatively inexpensive gift he had bought, Bertie wrenches his Uncle James&#x27;s card off a toy aeroplane, replacing it with his own. Bertie&#x27;s Uncle George is Lord Yaxley, so if he inherited that title he is likely to be Bertie&#x27;s eldest living uncle, and Bertie&#x27;s paternal grandfather may have held the title as well. However, the relative ages of Bertie&#x27;s father and remaining uncles are not delineated, so it is unclear whether Bertie or one of his male cousins is in line to inherit the peerage. It is theoretically possible that the title was a life peerage under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876, but unlikely as Uncle George is described as having devoted his life to food and drink.

In the story &quot;Bertie Changes His Mind&quot;, Bertie mentions a sister who has three daughters, referred to by Jeeves as Mrs Scholfield, though his sister and nieces are not mentioned again.

====List of relatives====
Bertie Wooster has many relatives who appear or are mentioned in the stories. Three other possible relatives (Cuthbert and Julia Mannering-Phipps and their son Gussie) appear or are mentioned in &quot;Extricating Young Gussie&quot;, though in this story Bertie&#x27;s surname appears to be Mannering-Phipps. It is not shown in later stories if the three relatives are renamed Wooster. In his book &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in Wodehouse&quot;, Daniel Garrison suggests that the protagonist of &quot;Extricating Young Gussie&quot;, Bertie Mannering-Phipps, is a prototype of the later Bertie Wooster. Richard Usborne writes that Bertie Wooster does appear in &quot;Extricating Young Gussie&quot; though his last name is Mannering-Phipps in the story. In the book &quot;Wodehouse in Woostershire&quot;, it is suggested that Bertie&#x27;s grandmother was married twice, first to a Mannering-Phipps and then to a Wooster with the title Lord Yaxley. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the Mannering-Phipps family, they are listed with asterisks below.

Some marriages occur during the course of the stories. Bertie&#x27;s uncle Lord Yaxley marries Maud Wilberforce as a result of the events of &quot;Indian Summer of an Uncle&quot;, and Bertie&#x27;s aunt Agatha Gregson marries Lord Worplesdon sometime before the events of &quot;Joy in the Morning&quot;.

Bertie Wooster&#x27;s relatives include:

===Fiancées===

Bertie never marries, but frequently finds himself engaged. In an early story, he attempts to become engaged to Gwladys Pendlebury, an artist who paints his portrait. In the early years, he is rather given to impulsive and short-lived infatuations, under the influence of which he proposes to Florence Craye (in &quot;Jeeves Takes Charge&quot;, the fourth story in terms of publication and the first in the internal timeline of the books), to Pauline Stoker, and to Bobbie Wickham. In all of these cases, he rethinks the charms of the holy state and a &quot;lovely profile&quot; upon closer understanding of the personalities of the women in question. Having already received a proposal from him, each woman assumes that she has an open invitation to marry Bertie whenever she has a spat with her current fiancé. Madeline Bassett and Honoria Glossop suffer from a similar delusion, though in each of their cases Bertie was attempting to plead the case of a friend (Gussie Fink-Nottle and Bingo Little respectively) but was misinterpreted as confessing his own love. In all of these cases, Bertie, who aims to be an honorable &quot;preux chevalier&quot; (valiant knight), feels he has to agree to the marriage, and relies on Jeeves to somehow end the engagement. In the later stories and novels, Bertie regards engagement solely as a dire situation from which Jeeves must extricate him. In the last novel, Bertie acknowledges that his infatuations have all been short-lived.

In &quot;Thank You, Jeeves&quot;, Bertie states that he is glad he did not marry Pauline Stoker because she is &quot;one of those girls who want you to come and swim a mile before breakfast and rout you out when you are trying to snatch a wink of sleep after lunch for a merry five sets of tennis&quot;, and adds that his ideal wife should be, in contrast to the dynamic Pauline, &quot;something rather more on the lines of Janet Gaynor&quot;. However, later in the same novel, Jeeves tells Pauline that he doubts a union between her and Bertie would have been successful as Bertie is &quot;essentially one of Nature&#x27;s bachelors&quot;.

Though Jeeves frequently rescues Bertie from unwanted engagements, only rarely do they openly discuss the matter, as they both feel it would be unseemly to &quot;bandy a woman&#x27;s name&quot; in such a way.

Of the women Bertie Wooster becomes engaged to, those who appear in the most Jeeves stories are Madeline Bassett (5 novels), Lady Florence Craye (1 short story, 3 novels), Bobbie Wickham (3 short stories, 1 novel), and Honoria Glossop (4 short stories).

===Friends===

Bertie is loyal to his friends, willing to do whatever he can to solve their problems, saying &quot;when there is a chance of helping a pal we Woosters have no thought of self&quot;. This has led to problems for him, since he is regularly drawn into troublesome tasks. Though he continues to provide help, Bertie is aware that people do not hesitate to give him unpleasant jobs; as he says, &quot;Whenever something sticky was afoot and action had to be taken the cry was sure to go up, &#x27;Let Wooster do it.&#x27;&quot; Bertie&#x27;s friends are eager to ask for advice from Jeeves, who enjoys helping Bertie&#x27;s pals. Jeeves essentially runs a &quot;big Mayfair consulting practice&quot; from their home, and Bertie is accustomed to his acquaintances consulting Jeeves directly without talking to him first. Sometimes Bertie tries to assert that he can also solve problems, but truly he thinks of Jeeves as a genius as much as everyone else does.

Among Bertie&#x27;s friends, those who appear in the most Jeeves stories are Bingo Little (10 short stories), Gussie Fink-Nottle (4 novels), and Tuppy Glossop (3 short stories, 1 novel). Others include Rev. Harold P. &quot;Stinker&quot; Pinker, Claude &quot;Catsmeat&quot; Potter-Pirbright, Oliver &quot;Sippy&quot; Sipperley, and Rockmetteller &quot;Rocky&quot; Todd. Sometimes a friend or acquaintance will become a jealous antagonist, for example G. D&#x27;Arcy &quot;Stilton&quot; Cheesewright.

Some pals of Bertie&#x27;s are occasionally mentioned who do not play major roles in the Jeeves stories, including Freddie Widgeon, Cyril &quot;Barmy&quot; Fotheringay-Phipps, and Oofy Prosser. Many Drones Club members appear in the separate Wodehouse Drones Club stories. Bertie is acquainted with Lord Emsworth, another of Wodehouse&#x27;s best-known characters, who appears in the Blandings Castle stories. Bertie also knows Lord Emsworth&#x27;s son Freddie Threepwood.

===Adversaries===

Bertie encounters a number of adversaries who are suspicious of him or threaten him in some way. These individuals are often quick to misinterpret Bertie&#x27;s actions, which may seem strange due to the bizarre situations he becomes involved in, and come to the conclusion that Bertie is somehow mentally unsound or that he is a thief.

Among Bertie&#x27;s various adversaries, those who appear in the most Jeeves stories are the &quot;nerve specialist&quot; or &quot;loony doctor&quot; Sir Roderick Glossop (4 short stories, 2 novels), and the intimidating &quot;amateur dictator&quot; Roderick Spode (4 novels), though Sir Roderick Glossop later becomes Bertie&#x27;s friend. Other antagonists include Sir Watkyn Bassett and Major Plank.

==Language==
With two exceptions, the stories are told in the first person by Bertie Wooster. Although Jeeves occasionally describes Bertie as &quot;mentally negligible&quot;, Bertie&#x27;s narrative style reflects notable facility with the English language. He displays what would be considered by today&#x27;s standards a broad, if not very deep, knowledge of English literature, making allusions from sources including the Bible, Shakespeare, and romantic literature of the 19th century (all of these references typical of the schooling he and his 20th-century audience received), even if he relies on Jeeves to complete quotations for him. Bertie frequently applies these serious references in an over-simplified, farcical manner to the situation he is in, or uses the reference in a way totally contrary to its original context and meaning. In one story, Bertie complains about the constant attentions of a woman in whom he has no interest by referring to her as &quot;young Sticketh-Closer-Than-a-Brother&quot; in an annoyed fashion. The verse (Proverbs 18:24) that Bertie partially quotes actually praises the value of close friendship when it refers to a &quot;friend that sticketh closer than a brother&quot;.

Bertie is fond of pre-World War I slang, peppering his speech with words and phrases such as &quot;what ho!&quot;, &quot;pipped&quot;, &quot;bally&quot; and so on, and he informally abbreviates words and phrases, such as &quot;eggs and b&quot; (eggs and bacon). He uses exaggerated imagery, and throughout the stories, he almost never says the word &quot;walk&quot;, instead using terms and phrases like &quot;toddle&quot;, &quot;stagger&quot;, &quot;ankle&quot;, &quot;leg it&quot;, &quot;make tracks&quot;, &quot;whoosh&quot; and &quot;whizz&quot;. His informal language is juxtaposed with advanced vocabulary; Bertie claims that over the years, he has picked up a vocabulary of sorts from Jeeves. As the years pass, he makes references to popular film and literature that would have been well-known to readers when the books were written.

One literary device Bertie employs is the transferred epithet, using an adjective to modify a noun instead of using the corresponding adverb to modify the verb of the sentence. Examples of this include &quot;I balanced a thoughtful lump of sugar on the teaspoon&quot; and &quot;He waved a concerned cigar&quot;. He also favours the mixed metaphor, an absurd combination of two incompatible metaphors. For example, after one of Bertie&#x27;s plans goes awry, he decides not to dwell on his mistake, saying &quot;spilt milk blows nobody any good&quot;; this combines the proverbs &quot;It&#x27;s no use crying over spilt milk&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s an ill wind that blows no good&quot;. Bertie also uses running gags, making humorous statements and recalling them later within the same story and in other stories.

==Adaptations==

; Television 
* Ian Carmichael played the part of Bertie Wooster (opposite Dennis Price as Jeeves) in the BBC television series, &quot;The World of Wooster&quot; (1965–1967).
* Jonathan Cecil (who, like Bertie himself, was an Old Etonian) played him in the BBC tribute film &quot;Thank You, P. G. Wodehouse&quot; (1981), with Michael Aldridge as Jeeves.
* Hugh Laurie (also an Old Etonian) portrayed Bertie Wooster in the early-1990s ITV series &quot;Jeeves and Wooster&quot; opposite his long-time comedy partner, Stephen Fry, as Jeeves and has been widely acclaimed as &quot;the definitive portrayal of Jeeves &amp; Wooster&quot;. While Bertie&#x27;s character is largely faithful to his character in the canon, Bertie is also depicted as being a capable pianist and singer, making use of actor-musician Hugh Laurie&#x27;s musical talents. He plays and sings show tunes and popular songs of the 1920s and 1930s, including the songs &quot;Nagasaki&quot;, &quot;Forty-Seven Ginger-Headed Sailors&quot;, &quot;Puttin&#x27; on the Ritz&quot;, &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot; and &quot;You Do Something to Me&quot;. In the original stories, Bertie sings often and is said to have a pleasant &quot;light baritone voice&quot;, and can read sheet music, though it is unclear to what extent he plays piano. In the episode &quot;The Delayed Arrival&quot;, Bertie crossdresses and assumes an alias when he briefly pretends to be a maid named &quot;Beryl&quot; employed in the Travers household, Brinkley Court. This did not occur in the original novel on which the episode was based, &quot;Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit&quot;.

; Film
* David Niven was the first, and to date the only actor to play Bertie Wooster in a mainstream theatrical film, in &quot;Thank You, Jeeves!&quot; (1936). This film bore almost no resemblance to Wodehouse&#x27;s fiction. Bertie was portrayed as woman-chaser, the opposite of the more common situation in the stories, in which Bertie strives to avoid marriage entanglements. Jeeves (Arthur Treacher) seemed more of a pompous prig than a brilliant helper. Notably, when Bertie grows a moustache that Jeeves disapproves of in &quot;Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit&quot;, Bertie cites Niven&#x27;s moustache as a justification. A follow-up film, &quot;Step Lively, Jeeves&quot; (1937), did not feature Bertie Wooster as a character.

; Radio 
* &quot;Leave It to Jeeves&quot; (1940) was a radio drama broadcast on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Forecast&quot; series. Edward Everett Horton portrayed Bertie Wooster and Alan Mowbray portrayed Jeeves.
* Naunton Wayne portrayed Bertie Wooster in a 1955 radio drama based on &quot;Right Ho, Jeeves&quot; broadcast on the BBC Light Programme, with Deryck Guyler as Jeeves.
* Terry-Thomas played Bertie Wooster opposite Roger Livesey as Jeeves in a dramatisation of &quot;Indian Summer of an Uncle&quot; and &quot;Jeeves Takes Charge&quot; released as a record album in 1958.
* Richard Briers portrayed Bertie Wooster in the BBC Radio 4 series &quot;What Ho, Jeeves!&quot; opposite Michael Hordern as Jeeves. The series ran occasionally from 1973 to 1981.
* Simon Cadell played Bertie Wooster opposite David Suchet as Jeeves in the BBC &quot;Saturday Night Theatre&quot; radio adaptation of &quot;Right Ho, Jeeves&quot; in 1988.
* Mark Richard portrayed Bertie Wooster with Martin Jarvis as Jeeves in a 1997 L.A. Theatre Works dramatisation of &quot;The Code of the Woosters&quot;. Simon Templeman played Bertie Wooster with Paxton Whitehead as Jeeves in the same organisation&#x27;s 1998 recording of an adaptation of &quot;Thank You, Jeeves&quot;.
* Marcus Brigstocke played Bertie Wooster in a BBC Radio 4 adaptation of &quot;The Code of the Woosters&quot; in 2006, with Andrew Sachs as Jeeves.
* James Callis voiced Bertie Wooster in a 2018 BBC adaptation of &quot;Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves&quot;, with Martin Jarvis as Jeeves.

; Audiobooks 
* Audiobooks of many of the Jeeves stories and novels in which Bertie Wooster is the narrator have been recorded by British actors, including Simon Callow, Jonathan Cecil, Ian Carmichael, Martin Jarvis, Frederick Davidson, and Dinsdale Landen.
* In 2020, Audible released the first volume of their P.G Wodehouse collection. This volume contains the books The Inimitable Jeeves, Carry On Jeeves, Right Ho, Jeeves, The Code of the Woosters and Joy in the Morning. They are narrated by Stephen Fry.

;Stage
* The 1975 musical &quot;Jeeves&quot; opened with David Hemmings as Bertie Wooster, and Michael Aldridge as Jeeves.
* &quot;By Jeeves&quot;, the 1996 rewrite of the previous musical, opened with Steven Pacey as Bertie Wooster, and Malcolm Sinclair as Jeeves. In the 2001 recording, John Scherer portrayed Bertie Wooster, with Martin Jarvis as Jeeves.
* The play &quot;Jeeves and Wooster in Perfect Nonsense&quot; opened in 2013 with Stephen Mangan as Bertie Wooster and Matthew Macfadyen as Jeeves.

;Literature
*In the fictional biography &quot;Jeeves: A Gentleman&#x27;s Personal Gentleman&quot; by C. Northcote Parkinson, Bertie Wooster becomes the 9th Earl of Yaxley on the death of his uncle George, marries Bobbie Wickham and makes Jeeves the landlord of the Angler&#x27;s Rest pub, which is on the Yaxley estate. Jeeves then supplants Mr Mulliner as the resident expert and storyteller of the pub.
* In Alan Moore&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier&quot;, Bertie Wooster appears in the segment &quot;What Ho, Gods of the Abyss?&quot; which comically mixes elements of Wodehouse with H.P. Lovecraft&#x27;s Cthulhu Mythos. Bertie blithely recounts the arrival of a Mi-go to Brinkley Court and Aunt Dahlia&#x27;s possession by Cthulhu. The Lovecraftian menaces are driven off by Jeeves with the assistance of Mina Murray, Allan Quatermain, Carnacki and but not before Gussie Fink-Nottle&#x27;s brain is surgically removed (a condition that, in the end, causes no real difference in his behaviour). Throughout the events, Bertie remains unaware of the true nature of the goings-on.
* &quot;Jeeves and the Wedding Bells&quot;, a Jeeves novel by Sebastian Faulks narrated by Bertie Wooster, was published in 2013. It was authorized by the Wodehouse estate. The audiobook was narrated by Julian Rhind-Tutt.
* The novel &quot;Jeeves and the King of Clubs&quot; was written by Ben Schott and published in 2018 with the authorization of the Wodehouse estate. The audiobook was narrated by James Lance. Schott wrote a sequel titled &quot;Jeeves and the Leap of Faith&quot;, which was published in 2020. The audiobook for &quot;Jeeves and the Leap of Faith&quot; was narrated by Daniel Ings.

<text>Universities in the United Kingdom have generally been instituted by royal charter, papal bull, Act of Parliament, or an instrument of government under the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 or the Higher Education and Research Act 2017. Degree awarding powers and the &#x27;university&#x27; title are protected by law, although the precise arrangements for gaining these vary between the constituent countries of the United Kingdom.

Institutions that hold degree awarding powers are termed &quot;recognised bodies&quot;, this list includes all universities, university colleges and colleges of the University of London, some higher education colleges, and the Archbishop of Canterbury. Degree courses may also be provided at &quot;listed bodies&quot;, leading to degrees validated by a recognised body. Undergraduate applications to almost all UK universities are managed by the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS).

While legally, &#x27;university&#x27; refers to an institution that has been granted the right to use the title, in common usage it now normally includes colleges of the University of London, including in official documents such as the Dearing Report.

The representative bodies for higher education providers in the United Kingdom are Universities UK, GuildHE and Independent Higher Education. The responsible minister within the Department for Education is the Minister of State for Skills, currently Jacqui Smith.

==History==
Universities in Britain date back to the dawn of mediaeval &quot;studium generale&quot;, with Oxford and Cambridge taking their place among the world&#x27;s oldest universities. No other universities were successfully founded in England during this period; opposition from Oxford and Cambridge blocked attempts to establish universities in Northampton and Stamford. Medical schools in London (i.e., Barts and St Thomas&#x27;s), though not universities in their own right, were among the first to provide medical teaching in England.

In Scotland, St Andrew&#x27;s, Glasgow and King&#x27;s College, Aberdeen were founded by papal bull. Post-Reformation, these were joined by Edinburgh, Marischal College, Aberdeen, and the short-lived Fraserburgh University. In England, meanwhile, Henry VIII&#x27;s plan to found a university in Durham came to nothing and a later attempt to found a university at Durham during the Commonwealth was successfully opposed by Oxford and Cambridge. Gresham College was, however, established in London in the late 16th century, despite concerns expressed by Cambridge. In Ireland, Trinity College Dublin was founded as &quot;the mother of a University&quot; by a royal charter from Queen Elizabeth.

The 18th century saw the establishment of medical schools at Edinburgh and Glasgow universities and at hospitals in London. A number of dissenting academies were also established. But the next attempt to found a university did not come until the Andersonian Institute (now Strathclyde University) was established in Glasgow in 1798.

===19th-century expansion===
The French Revolution and the ensuing Napoleonic wars led to over 40% of universities in Europe closing. From 153 universities in 1789, numbers fell to only 83 in 1815. The next quarter century saw a rebound, with 15 new universities founded, bringing numbers back to 98 by 1840.

In England, the late 18th and early 19th centuries saw the arrival of Catholic seminaries driven from the continent by the French Revolution and the establishment of the St Bees Theological College to train Anglican priests in 1816. The first Anglican college to move beyond specialist training to provide a more general university education in Arts was in Wales: St David&#x27;s College, Lampeter (now part of the University of Wales, Trinity Saint David) was founded in 1822, opened in 1827, and gained a royal charter in 1828.

By then, the higher education revolution was well under way. Between 1824 and 1834 ten medical schools were established in provincial cities; many of these went on to form the nuclei of the redbrick universities, and in 1825 there was serious talk of founding a third English university in York. This would, however, have required government support. The opinion of Robert Peel – cabinet minister and MP for Oxford University – was sought, and (after consulting with his constituents) he advised against proceeding.

This period also saw the establishment of Mechanics Institutes in a number of cities. The first of these, established in Edinburgh in 1821, would eventually become Heriot-Watt University, while the London Mechanics Institute, established in 1823, developed into Birkbeck, University of London. Many others would eventually become polytechnics and then, in 1992, universities. The Polytechnic Institution (now the University of Westminster) opened at 309 Regent Street, London, in August 1838, to provide &quot;practical knowledge of the various arts and branches of science connected with manufacturers, mining operations and rural economy&quot;.

Very soon after news of the York scheme broke, Thomas Campbell wrote to &quot;The Times&quot; proposing a university be founded in London. This would become UCL, founded in 1826 as a joint stock company under the name of London University. Due to its lack of theology teaching, its willingness to grant degrees (if it were given this power) to non-Anglicans, and its unauthorised assumption of the title of &quot;university&quot;, this inspired calls in 1827 for the foundation of a &#x27;true and genuine &quot;London University&quot;&#x27; by royal charter, to be known (in the same manner as Edinburgh was officially known as the College of King James VI) as &quot;The College of King George IV in London&quot;. This became King&#x27;s College London, granted a royal charter in 1829 – but as a college rather than a university.

UCL was revolutionary not just in admitting non-Anglicans (indeed non-Anglicans were allowed to study at Cambridge, but not to take degrees, and UCL could not grant them degrees); it also pioneered the study of modern languages and of geography, as well as appointing the first Professor of English Language and Literature, although the study of English Literature as a distinct subject was pioneered by King&#x27;s College London. Neither of the colleges was residential – a break from the two ancient English universities, although non-residential universities were the norm in Scotland.

In 1830, a Whig government was elected with Earl Grey as Prime Minister, and in early 1831 news broke that a charter was to be granted to the London University, officially recognising it as a university and thus enabling it to award degrees. Cambridge voted to petition the King not to allow the awarding of degrees with the same name as theirs or Oxford&#x27;s. The charter was blocked.

Then, later in 1831, a plan was announced to found a university in Durham. Grey&#x27;s government supported the bill to establish the university, despite it limiting its degrees to Anglicans. Thus the University of Durham was established by Act of Parliament in 1832, and opened in 1833. In 1836 it pioneered the system of external examiners for its final degree examinations, bringing in Oxford academics to ensure the same standards. It was incorporated by royal charter in 1837 and awarded its first degrees the same year. In 1838 it opened Britain&#x27;s first course in engineering, and in 1846 pioneered &quot;halls&quot; accommodation, where students let rooms ready-furnished and serviced by shared staff, and took all their meals together. This was in contrast to the system at Oxford and Cambridge (and in Durham&#x27;s original college) where students had to furnish their own rooms, supply their own servants, and provide their own food.

In 1834, the House of Commons backed the granting of a charter to the London University. In 1835, the government responded by announcing its intention to establish the University of London as an examining board that would grant degrees to affiliated colleges and medical schools. This was done in 1836, with the old London University accepting a charter as a college under the name of University College, London.

The new University of London achieved one of the principal goals of the founders of UCL: it would award degrees without any religious test, the first university in England to do so. The first degrees were conferred in 1839 to students from UCL and King&#x27;s College London. But from 1840 it affiliated other colleges and schools, opening up the possibility of degrees for many students who would not previously have attended a university. Another big step came in 1858 when the system of affiliated colleges was abandoned and London degrees were opened to any man who passed the examination. From 1878, University of London degrees were opened to women – the first in the United Kingdom.

In 1845, Queen&#x27;s Colleges were established across Ireland: in Belfast, Cork and Galway, followed by the establishment of the Queen&#x27;s University of Ireland in 1850 as a federal university encompassing the three colleges. In response, the Catholic University of Ireland (never recognised as a university by the British state, although granted degree awarding power by the Pope) was established in Dublin by the Catholic Church. This eventually led to the dissolution of the Queen&#x27;s University in 1879 and its replacement by the Royal University of Ireland, an examining board after the pattern of the University of London.

The first women&#x27;s college was Bedford College in London, which opened in 1849. It was followed by Royal Holloway (with which it merged in the 1980s) and the London School of Medicine for Women in London and colleges in Oxford and Cambridge. After London opened its degrees to women in 1878, UCL opened its courses in Arts, Law and Science to women, although it took the First World War to open up the London medical schools. By the end of the 19th century, the only British universities not granting degrees to women were Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin.

Non-Anglicans were admitted to degrees at Oxford in 1854, Cambridge in 1856 and Durham in 1865. The remaining tests were (except in theology) removed by the Universities Tests Act 1871, allowing non-Anglicans to become full members of the university (membership of Convocation at Oxford and Durham or the Senate at Cambridge) and to hold teaching positions.

An Act of Parliament was passed in 1858 that modernised the constitutions of all of the Scottish universities. Under this Act, the two universities in Aberdeen were united into the University of Aberdeen (explicitly preserving the foundation date of King&#x27;s College) and the University of Edinburgh was made independent from the town corporation.

The first of the civic university colleges was the Anglican Queen&#x27;s College, Birmingham, built on the nucleus of the Birmingham Medical School, which gained its royal charter in 1843 but did not ultimately prove a success. This was followed in 1851 by Owens College, Manchester. Further university colleges followed in Newcastle (1871), notable for admitting women to its courses from the start, Aberystwyth (1872), Leeds (1874), Bristol (1876), Sheffield (1879), Mason College, Birmingham (1880), Dundee (1881), Liverpool (1881), Nottingham (1881), Cardiff (1883), and Bangor (1884). With the exceptions of Newcastle (associated with Durham) and Dundee (associated with St Andrews), all of the university colleges prepared their students for London degrees.

In the late 1870s, Owens College applied for university status. After objections by other civic colleges, it was decided instead to erect the Victoria University as a federal body, with Owens College as, initially, its only college. It was joined by Liverpool in 1884 and Leeds in 1887.

In 1889, government funding was provided to the English provincial university colleges (with the exception of Queen&#x27;s College, Birmingham), along with Dundee in Scotland, and UCL and King&#x27;s College in London. Government funding was already being provided to the ancient Scottish universities, the University of London, and to the Welsh and Irish colleges. Bedford College in London (1894), Reading (1901) and Southampton (1902) were later added to the grant to university colleges.

In 1893, the University of Wales was established as another federal body, uniting the colleges in Aberystwyth, Cardiff and Bangor, but not St David&#x27;s College, Lampeter.

The late 19th century saw UCL and King&#x27;s College London campaigning for a say in how the University of London was run, alongside a campaign for a &quot;teaching university&quot; for London. Royal commissions were held and a charter was drawn up for the &quot;Albert University&quot; that would have seen the two colleges leave the University of London and form a federal body, like the colleges of the Victoria University. In the end it was decided to reform the University of London itself, this was put into effect by an Act of Parliament in 1898, leading to completely new statutes establishing the federal University of London in 1900.

===20th century===

1900 also saw Mason College, Birmingham (which had absorbed the Medical School from Queen&#x27;s College in 1892) become the University of Birmingham. This was the first of the redbrick universities to gain university status. Over the next decade the Victoria University dissolved, its colleges becoming the universities of Manchester, Leeds, and Liverpool, and the colleges in Sheffield and Bristol also gained university status as the University of Sheffield and the University of Bristol. The last of the original provincial university colleges, in Newcastle, remained connected to the University of Durham, but moved to a federal structure with equal Newcastle and Durham divisions. In Ireland, Queen&#x27;s College Belfast became Queen&#x27;s University Belfast, and the other colleges formed the National University of Ireland, replacing the Royal University.

The First World War caused financial crises in many British universities and university colleges. This led to the formation of the University Grants Committee after the war, with Oxford, Cambridge and the Durham division of Durham University finally accepting government funding. Only one institution, Reading University (1926), became a university between the wars. New university colleges were set up in Swansea (1920), Leicester (1921), Exeter (1922) and Hull (1927).

===Expansion after 1945===

After the Second World War, there was an enormous expansion in the demand for higher education. A final public university college was set up in Keele in 1949; this was the first university college to receive full degree awarding powers as a college rather than on becoming a university (St David&#x27;s College, Lampeter, held limited degree awarding power from the mid 19th century, but could only award BA and BD degrees).
In 1952, there were just 18 universities in the UK: Oxford, Cambridge, St Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Durham, London, Wales, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Sheffield, Queen’s University Belfast, Bristol, Reading and Nottingham. 

Between 1948 (Nottingham) and 1967 (Dundee) all of the university colleges (except those that had become colleges of the University of London) achieved independent university status. Newcastle University is notable for having been made a university in 1963 by Act of Parliament rather than by royal charter. The 1960s saw a large expansion in the number of universities in the UK with eight universities, known as the plateglass universities, established as new institutions rather than from earlier university colleges, a number of other institutions that had not been university colleges promoted directly to university status following the Robbins Report in 1963, and the Open University founded as a distance-learning University.

In 1973, the University College at Buckingham was established as a private sector, non-profit college, opening in 1976. It awarded &quot;licences&quot; that were externally examined in the same manner as degrees, rather than being associated with the University of London or another parent university like the earlier university colleges. In 1983, it became the UK&#x27;s first private university after being granted a royal charter as the University of Buckingham.

===Since 1992===
A major change to UK higher education occurred in 1992 with the abolition of the &quot;binary divide&quot; between universities and polytechnics. By the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, the polytechnics and the Scottish central institutions all became universities. These post-1992 (or &quot;new&quot;) institutions nearly doubled the number of universities in the UK.

In 1993, the University of London underwent a major shake-up, with the larger colleges being granted direct access to government funding and the right to confer University of London degrees themselves. This was a major step towards their being recognised generally as &quot;de facto&quot; universities.

In 1997, Cardiff University (then the University of Wales, Cardiff) was granted degree awarding powers. This was the first time such powers had been granted to a constituent institution of a university (although the University of Wales, Lampeter held degree awarding powers, these were granted prior to it joining the federal university). Over the next decade, all of the constituent institutions of the University of Wales and many of those of the University of London gained their own degree awarding powers.

In 2005, Cardiff University left the University of Wales, which shifted to a confederal structure in 2007 before being essentially dissolved following a series of scandals in 2011. In 2007, Imperial College left the University of London, raising fears about the future of that federal institution. However, it has survived and attracted new members, although many of the larger colleges now award their own degrees. In 2016, City University, London was the first institute to voluntarily surrender university status when it became a college of the University of London.

In 2018, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that hundreds of academics had been accused of bullying students and colleagues, leading to calls from Venki Ramakrishnan, president of the Royal Society, for an overhaul of workplace practices in universities and from Fiona Watt, chair of the Medical Research Council, for an annual national audit of bullying incidents.

===University funding from 1945===
In the years following the end of the Second World War, local education authorities (LEAs) paid some student tuition fees and provided some non-mature students with a maintenance grant. Under the Education Act 1962 a national mandatory award of student maintenance grant was established, payable by the LEAs to students on most full-time courses. In 1980, the level of grant increased from £380 to £1,430.

As the university population rose during the 1980s the sums paid to universities became linked to their performance and efficiency, and by the mid-1990s funding per student had dropped by 40% since the mid-1970s, while numbers of full-time students had reached around 2,000,000 (around a third of the age group), up from around 1,300,000.

In 1989, the levels of maintenance grants were frozen at £2,265 – which since 1985 had been means tested – but a system of student loans was introduced to provide for additional funding. Initially loans of up to £420 were available, and could be taken out by all students. The costs of tuition continued to be met in full for all domestic students.

Following an investigation into the future of universities, the July 1997 report of the National Committee of Inquiry into Higher Education, chaired by the then Sir Ronald (later Lord) Dearing recommended the ending of universal free higher education, and that students should pay £1,000 towards the cost of their tuition fees, which would be recovered in the form of a graduate tax.

Tuition fees were introduced in 1998, raised to £3,000 a year in 2006, and passed £9,000 a year by 2012. At the time of the Dearing Report, tuition fees were still paid in full by the local education authorities, student grants of up to £1,755 (£2,160 in London) were linked to family income, and a subsidised student loan of £1,685 (£2,085 in London) was available. Instead of following Dearing&#x27;s suggestions, the grant was replaced by the present loan scheme, introduced for students starting in 1998. There was a transition year when about half the previous means-tested grant was available, though they still had to pay the new £1,000 tuition fee. From 1999, the grant was abolished altogether.

The abolition of tuition fees was a major issue in the 1999 Scottish parliamentary elections, and subsequently was part of the agreement that led to the Labour/Liberal Democrats coalition that governed Scotland from 1999 to 2003.

From the academic year 2006/7, a new system of tuition fees was introduced in England. These variable tuition fees of up to £3,000 per year are paid up-front as previously, but new student loans are available that may only be used to pay for tuition fees, and must be repaid after graduation, in addition to the existing loan. In fact, there is very little variation in the tuition fees charged by universities—nearly all charge the maximum tuition fee on all courses. Instead, the differences appear in the nature and value of various &#x27;access&#x27; bursaries that are on offer. There has been considerable debate since the 1980s about the tendency toward vocationalism and the decline in the humanities, as well as a growing mindset among senior administrators that is preoccupied with marketing and corporate-like measures of &quot;success.&quot;

In 2010, the government voted to raise the amount universities can charge for undergraduate tuition fees (for England only) to between £6,000 – £9,000 per year though most charge the maximum. In 2016, the government raised the cap on tuition fees to £9,250 from 2017. In 2024, the government raised the cap to £9,535 for 2025/26.
In recent years, tuition fees charged from foreign students have become an important source of university income. International fees for a Master&#x27;s degree typically range from £10,000 to £35,000, with the subject and the university&#x27;s ranking being the main determinants. In the academic year 2022/23, tuition fees from non-UK students amounted to a total of £11.8 billion across all universities, equal to 46% of all higher education course fees, and nearly 23% of total university income, with some universities earning as much as three quarters of their fees from international students.

==Governance==
Universities in the United Kingdom do not have a coherent system of funding or governance, and both remain heavily debated. A growing body of other legal rights, for instance, for staff in reasonable expectations of fair procedure, or for students in fairness over the awarding of degrees, has grown through judicial review.

===Degree awarding powers and university title===

Both degree awarding powers and university title are controlled under UK law, and it is illegal for an institution to call itself a university or to purport to offer UK degrees without authorisation. Higher education is a devolved power, so the rules for degree awarding powers and university title differ between the four countries of the United Kingdom.

In Scotland and Northern Ireland the last UK national standards (from 1999) still apply. Institutions may hold taught degree awarding powers, allowing them to award ordinary and honours bachelor&#x27;s degrees and taught master&#x27;s degrees, and research degree awarding powers, allowing them additionally to award master&#x27;s degrees by research and doctoral degrees. Institutions with taught degree powers may be awarded the title of &quot;university college&quot;, but for university title an institution must hold research degree awarding powers, as well as having over 4,000 full-time equivalent (FTE) students, with over 3,000 on degree -level courses and at least 500 higher education students in each of five broad subject areas. For both degree awarding powers and university title, the final decision is made by the Privy Council on the advice of the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA).

The rules in England and Wales diverged from those in Scotland and Northern Ireland in 2004 and were further modified in 2010 with the introduction of foundation degree awarding powers for further education colleges. Under these regulations, which remain in force in Wales, while taught and research degree awarding powers are awarded indefinitely to institutions in the publicly funded higher education sector, they are time limited to six years for other institutions (e.g. private colleges and universities) after which they must be renewed. The rules for university title allowed institutions holding only taught degree awarding powers to become universities in England and Wales from 2004, and the requirement for minimum student numbers across five broad subject areas was dropped. The overall higher education FTE student number criterion remained at 4,000, with 3,000 on degree-level courses (clarified to include foundation degrees, which has been introduced since the 1999 regulations). The final award of degree awarding powers continued to rest with the Privy Council; for university title it lay with the Privy Council for publicly funded institutions while alternative providers had to get permission to use &quot;University&quot; in their name under the Companies Act 2006, the recommendation in both cases coming from the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) via the relevant government department (in England) or from the Welsh Government.

England diverged from Wales in 2012 with a reduction in the number of higher education FTE students needed for university title to 1,000 (750 on degree level courses), with the addition that at least 55% of total FTE students had to be on higher education courses. There were further technical changes in 2015 before a complete overhaul of the system in England under the Higher Education and Research Act 2017. This saw the abolition of HEFCE and its replacement by the Office for Students (OfS). A new tier of degree awarding powers – bachelor&#x27;s degree awarding powers, allowing the award of degrees up to level 6 on the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications – was introduced.

Under this act, degree awarding powers were made available on a probationary basis, termed &quot;New DAPs&quot; to providers without a track record in higher education, who had previously had to have a validation agreement with a recognised body to establish a track record prior to gaining their own powers. Providers with a track record of the years or more can apply for time-limited &quot;Full DAPs&quot; and those who have held time-limited date awarding powers for more than three years can apply for &quot;Indefinite DAPs&quot;. Another change is that degree awarding powers can now be limited to some subjects rather than covering all possible degrees at that level as previously. There is also an intention to make it possible for institute to gain research degree awarding powers without taught degree awarding powers. New criteria for university title will apply for applications from April 2019, the government had started its intention that student numbers limits will be removed but that the criterion that 55 percent of students are on higher education courses will remain, and that providers with bachelor&#x27;s degree awarding powers and single subject degree awarding powers will be eligible for university title. The OfS will take over the responsibility of granting degree awarding powers and university title from the Privy Council, and will also be responsible for the awarding of university title to institutions outside of the publicly-funded higher education sector. The act gives OfS the ability to remove indefinite degree awarding powers and university title from any institution in England, including those granted these by royal charter.

===Staff and student voice===
Governance of universities is set by each university&#x27;s constitution, typically deriving from an Act of Parliament, a royal charter or an Order in Council issued by the Privy Council. The most progressive models support a high degree of voice for staff and students, with the Higher Education Code of Governance stating that:

Reforms were first put into law after an Oxford University commission of 1852 stated it must reverse &quot;successive interventions by which the government of the University was reduced to a narrow oligarchy.&quot; For example, since the Cambridge University Act 1856 set its rules in law, that university&#x27;s statutes require that its Regent House (mostly full-time university members) elects its governing body, the 23 member &quot;Council&quot;. Four members are elected by heads of colleges, four by professors and readers, eight by other academic fellows, three by students, four by a &quot;grace&quot; (a vote) of the whole Regent House.

In Scotland, the Universities (Scotland) Act 1966, with amendments by the Higher Education Governance (Scotland) Act 2016, contains minimum standards for the composition of courts, with a rector elected by students (but at Edinburgh University, staff also vote) and an elected vice-chairman. Assessors are appointed by the local authority, chancellor, general council and &quot;senatus academicus&quot;. Also there are student members, employee representatives and co-opted lay members. For instance, Aberdeen University has up to a 22 person &quot;court&quot;, with an elected rector and a person she or he chooses, a principal plus one she or he chooses, a vice-principal (five members), two members appointed by the local councils, four members appointed by the General Council, six members from the Senatus Academicus, and up to five co-opted members.

In England and Wales, the pattern is more haphazard and often deficient in representation. The constitution of the London School of Economics, which unusually takes the legal form of a company limited by guarantee, currently requires its seventeen-member &quot;Council&quot; to have two student representatives, and three staff representatives. Anomalously, the King&#x27;s College London Act 1997 required a 38 member council with five ex-officio members, twenty lay appointees, eight elected by academics, three elected by students, and two by non-academic staff members, however this provision still remains to be put into effect on the &quot;appointed day&quot;. Other universities have a broad variety of governance structures, although if there is not a special statute or constitution, the general rules are set by the Education Reform Act 1988. This says that university governing bodies with constitutions issued by the Privy Council should have between 12 and 24 members, with up to thirteen lay members, up to two teachers, up to two students, and between one and nine members co-opted by the others. The wide variations in governing bodies raise the question about staff or student voice should have any limit, given their fundamental expertise in university life.

===Vice-chancellor===
The chancellorship of a university is a ceremonial position held by a prominent public figure. The actual executive responsibilities are borne by a vice-chancellor. In recent years, the role of the vice-chancellor has shifted from one of academic administration to strategic management. Accompanying this shift has been a massive rise in remuneration. In 2019, the Office for Students reported that the average basic salary for a university vice chancellor rose ahead of inflation, from £245,000 a year to £253,000 a year, with five heads earning more than £500,000 with benefits and severance payments included.

===Funding===
Before 1998, universities were funded mainly by central government, although they have been increasingly reliant on charging students and seeking to raise private capital. First, universities have the power to generate income through endowment trust funds, accumulated over generations of donations and investment. Second, under the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 there are funding councils paid for through general taxation for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. For England and Wales, the Secretary of State appoints 12 to 15 members and the chair, of which 6 to 9 should be academics and the remainder with &quot;industrial, commercial or financial&quot; backgrounds. Funds are administered at the councils&#x27; discretion but must consult with &quot;bodies representing the interests of higher education institutions&quot; such as the University and College Union and Universities UK. After the Higher Education and Research Act 2017, the English council from 2018 will be renamed the &quot;Office for Students&quot;. Further, there are seven research councils (AHRC, ESRC, MRC, etc.) which distribute funds after peer review of applications by academics conducting research.

Third, and most controversially, funding may come from charging students. From WW2 tuition fees in the UK were effectively abolished and local authorities paid maintenance grants. The Education Act 1962 formally required this position for all UK residents, and this continued through the expansion of university places recommended by the Robbins Report of 1963. However, over the 1980s and 1990s, grants were diminished, requiring students to become ever more reliant on their parents&#x27; wealth. Further, appointed in 1996, the Dearing Report argued for the introduction of tuition fees because it said graduates had &quot;improved employment prospects and pay.&quot; Instead of funding university through progressive tax, the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998 mandated £1,000 fees for home students. In England, this rose to £3,000 in the Higher Education Act 2004, and £9,000 after the Browne Review in 2010 led by the former CEO of oil corporation BP. In 2017, the limit on fees was £9,250 for students in England, £9,000 in Wales, and £3,805 in Northern Ireland. The same rates apply for European Union students, who cannot be discriminated against under EU law. By contrast, under the Scotland Act 1998, the Scottish government resolved not to introduce tuition fees for students under 25. Under EU law, it is allowable that English students are charged tuition fees in Scottish universities while EU students may not be, because non-discrimination does not apply to internal domestic affairs. For English universities, the Higher Education Act 2004 enables the Secretary of State to set fee limits, while universities are meant to ensure &quot;fair access&quot; by drafting a &quot;plan&quot; for &quot;equality of opportunity&quot;. There is no limit on international students fees, which have steadily risen to typically around double. A system of student loans is available for UK students through the government owned Student Loans Company. Means-tested grants were also available, but abolished for students who began university after August 2016. While EU students qualify for the same fees as UK students, they only qualify for loans (or previously grants) if they have been resident for three years in the UK. As the UK is in a minority of countries to still charge tuition fees, increasing demands have been made to abolish fees on the ground that they burden people without wealthy families in debt, deter disadvantaged students from education, and escalate income inequality.

There are five private universities (the charitable University of Buckingham and Regent&#x27;s University London, and the for-profit institutions The University of Law, BPP University and Arden University) where the government does not subsidise the tuition fees; at all other universities the government pays 75% or more of the average student fee. (The non-profit Richmond, The American International University in London is accredited by the American Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.) In April 2017 the House of Commons voted to increase the cap on tuition fees to £9,250 per year, which took effect for students starting in September 2017. Students in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland are also eligible for a means-tested grant, and many universities provide bursaries to poor students. Non-European Union students are not subsidised by the UK government and so have to pay much higher tuition fees.

===Other legal rights===
Rights to other standards go for staff, or students, universities are subject to both judicial review and rights in contract law because they are seen as having both an equally &quot;public&quot; and &quot;private&quot; nature. In a leading case of &quot;Clark v University of Lincolnshire and Humberside&quot; a student claimed that she should not have received a third class degree after her computer crashed, she lost an assignment, and was forced to rush a new one. The Court of Appeal held that her application for both breach of contract and judicial review should not be struck out because there could be a good case to hear, so long as it did seek to overturn &quot;issues of academic or pastoral judgment&quot; where &quot;any judgment of the courts would be jejune and inappropriate&quot;. However, the shorter time limit of three months in judicial review was more appropriate than six years in contract. Cases which have sought to challenge academic judgment for failing students are typically bound to fail, as grading with a fair process is in the bounds of academic judgment. In &quot;Buckland v Bournemouth University&quot;, where the university management interfered with academic assessment of student grades, this founded a right for a professor to claim he was constructively and unfairly dismissed. All access to education must be free from unlawful discrimination under the Equality Act 2010. In the Higher Education Act 2004 sections 11-21 provides for a modern complaints procedure to be followed in universities.

===Legal status===
All UK universities are independent bodies. With the exception of three private for-profit universities, British universities are charities. UK universities have four principal charity regulators. For universities outside England, this is the relevant national regulator: the Charity Commission for England and Wales for Welsh universities; the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator for Scottish Universities; and the Charity Commission for Northern Ireland for both Northern Irish universities.

In England, most (all but twenty, as of May 2018) higher education institutes are exempt charities that are not registered with the Charity Commission; the principal regulator for universities that are exempt charities is the Office for Students while for those that are not exempt it is the Charity Commission. Both of the two charitable private universities in England are regulated by the Charity Commission.

Universities in the UK have a wide variety of legal structures, leading to differences in their rights and powers, and in who is a member of the corporate body of the university.

The most common form among &quot;old&quot; universities is incorporation by royal charter. The form and objectives of the corporation are laid down in the individual charter and statutes, but commonly all graduates are members of the university. Many London colleges were also incorporated by this route. At the ancient Scottish universities the corporation is formed, under the Universities (Scotland) Act 1889, by the university court rather than the graduates. A chartered corporation may not change its statutes without the approval of the Privy Council.

Newcastle University is the only English university to be purely a statutory corporation, and the only &quot;old&quot; university not incorporated by royal charter, having been created by the Universities of Durham and Newcastle upon Tyne Act 1963. Among London colleges, Royal Holloway, University of London was created in 1985 by the Royal Holloway and Bedford New College Act 1985 (merging the 19th century Royal Holloway and Bedford colleges), and is similarly a statutory corporation. The main difference between this and a chartered corporation is that a statutory corporation has no power to do something that is not aligned with its defined aims and objectives.

Durham and London, while both incorporated by royal charter, have statutes made under Acts of Parliament rather than under their charters (in the case of Durham, this arrangement dates back to its creation by Act of Parliament in 1832, while for London it dates from the university&#x27;s reconstitution by Act of Parliament in 1900). This makes them both chartered and statutory corporations.

At Oxford and Cambridge, incorporated by a public Act of Parliament in 1571, only graduates who have proceeded to the academic rank of MA are members of the university. Their statues are made under Acts of Parliament, thus they are also considered statutory corporations for some purposes.

Most new universities are Higher Education Corporations, a form of corporation created by the Education Reform Act 1988 to incorporate the polytechnics independently of their local councils. In a higher education corporation, only the governing board is incorporated, not the graduates. Some newer London colleges share this status. Some new universities are companies limited by guarantee, a common form of incorporation used &quot;inter alia&quot; for some charities. The London School of Economics is also incorporated in this manner. The University of Chester is an unincorporated trusts within the Church of England, as was Bishop Grosseteste University up to 2019. This was also the original form of Durham University (at that time also a church university) between its foundation in 1832 and its incorporation by royal charter in 1837.

Under the Education Reform Act 1988, higher education providers will be either &quot;recognised bodies&quot; or &quot;listed bodies&quot;. A &quot;recognised body&quot; is defined as &quot;a university, college or other body which is authorised by Royal Charter or by or under Act of Parliament to grant degrees&quot; or a body authorised by such a body &quot;to act on its behalf in the granting of degrees&quot; (this later category covers the colleges of the University of London with regard to the issuing of London degrees). A &quot;listed body&quot; is defined as a body which either &quot;provides any course which is in preparation for a degree to be granted by a recognised body and is approved by or on behalf of the recognised body&quot; – independent institutions whose degrees are validated by a recognised body; or &quot;is a constituent college, school or hall or other institution of a university which is a recognised body&quot; – including the colleges of the universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Durham and the Highlands and Islands, the central institutes of the University of London (although not its colleges, which are recognised bodies), Manchester Business School, the university colleges affiliated to Queen&#x27;s University Belfast (Stranmillis University College and St Mary&#x27;s University College), and the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama (part of the University of South Wales).

===Mergers===
The first merger between British universities was that between King&#x27;s College, Aberdeen and Marischal College, Aberdeen under the Universities (Scotland) Act 1858 to form the University of Aberdeen, explicitly maintaining the foundation date of King&#x27;s College.

In 1984 the New University of Ulster merged with Ulster Polytechnic to form Ulster University. There have also been a number of mergers between colleges of the University of London, of particular note is the merger of Royal Holloway College and Bedford College in 1985 by Act of Parliament.

Cardiff University merged with the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology in 1984, and then re-merged with the University of Wales College of Medicine in 2004, the two having previously been separated in the 1930s.

Also in 2004, the Victoria University of Manchester and the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology merged to form the University of Manchester.

In 2002, London Guildhall University and the University of North London merged to form London Metropolitan University.

At around the same time a merger was proposed between Imperial College London and University College London, but was abandoned following protests.

In 2011, a merger was proposed between two universities in Scotland: University of Abertay Dundee and University of Dundee. This similarly did not occur.

In Wales, the University of Wales Lampeter and Trinity University College merged in 2010 to form the University of Wales, Trinity Saint David, with Swansea Metropolitan University joining in 2012 and the University of Wales committed to joining once it has completed its commitments to current students. Legally this was a takeover rather than a merger as UWTSD remains incorporated under Lampeter&#x27;s 1828 charter.

Also in Wales, the University of South Wales was formed in 2013 by a merger of the University of Glamorgan and the University of Wales, Newport. The University of Wales Institute Cardiff declined to take part in the merger, becoming Cardiff Metropolitan University.

==Categorisation==
UK universities can be categorised in a number of different ways. Historically, they have frequently been categorised based on age and location, while some more recent categorisations have used statistical techniques such as cluster analysis.

===Categorisation by age and location===
One of the earliest attempts to categorise British universities was by George Edwin Maclean in a 1917 report for the US Department of the Interior. This split the universities into five groups based on age, structure and location: ancient universities of England (including Durham as being similar in structure), Scottish universities, the University of London, the &quot;new or provincial universities&quot;, and the university colleges (Maclean&#x27;s report only covered England and Scotland; Wales and Ireland were omitted).

In the early 1950s the University Grants Committee (UGC) divided British universities by age into five groups by age and location. The English universities were divided into three: ancient, Durham and London, and the civic universities, with the other groups being the ancient Scottish universities (then the only universities in Scotland) and the University of Wales (then the only university in Wales). The 1963 Robbins Report split the (then existing) universities into seven categories: the ancient universities of England, the ancient universities of Scotland, the University of London, the older civic universities of England (Maclean&#x27;s &quot;new or provincial&quot; universities, with the addition of Durham, which at the time took in Newcastle), the University of Wales, the newer civic universities of England (mostly comprising Maclean&#x27;s university colleges), and the new foundations in England (the plate glass universities).

Watts (1972) expanded this to eight &quot;conventional&quot; categories: Oxbridge, ancient Scottish, London, larger civic (or redbrick), smaller civic (or white tile), Wales and Belfast, new (or plate glass) and technological. Scott (1995) has 12 categories: ancient English, the University of London, the Victorian civic universities, the newer civic universities (which Scott calls &quot;redbrick&quot;), the &quot;sui generis&quot; universities (which do not fit well into any other classification), the technological universities, Scottish universities, Welsh universities, Northern Irish universities, the Open University, the &quot;old &#x27;new (plate glass) universities and the &quot;new &#x27;new universities (former polytechnics), along with four categories of colleges (many of which have since become universities): multi-faculty, liberal arts, further/higher education and specialised. This was referred to by Henkel and Little (1999) as &quot;an extraordinary hodge-podge of historical, territorial and functional criteria&quot;. Bligh, McNay and Thomas (1999) divided universities more simply into six categories: (Oxford, Cambridge, and St Andrews), other collegiate (Durham, Lancaster and York, with a sub-category for the federal universities of London and Wales), older civic (including Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Glasgow), newer civic (including Newcastle but not Keele), post-war (also explicitly including York and implicitly Lancaster) and post-1992. Watson (2013) updates Scott&#x27;s (1995) classification, removing the separate categories for Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish universities and most of the categories of college (retaining only &quot;HE in FE&quot;), and adding &quot;New new new universities&quot; for the colleges that became universities following the Higher Education Act 2004, &quot;Private&quot; (a category defined as, at the time, only containing Buckingham) and &quot;For profit&quot;.

The groupings tend to be somewhat fuzzy in definition, with membership of each group varying between different authors. The common categories are:
* &quot;Ancient universities&quot;, which are normally subdivided geographically into the ancient universities of Scotland and Oxbridge in England.
* The &quot;University of London&quot; and its constituent colleges, which were founded in London from the early 19th century onwards as non-residential university colleges, following the pattern of the ancient universities of Scotland. Scott notes that it &quot;compris[es] large schools like Imperial College, University College and the London School of Economics, and small specialised institutes&quot;. London does not always feature as a stand-alone category: the UGC joined London with Durham, while Bligh, McNay and Thomas put it in with Durham, York, Lancaster and Wales in their &#x27;other collegiate&#x27; group.
* &quot;Civic universities&quot;, often divided into older or larger and younger or smaller, or some similar division. The older or larger civic universities, also known as redbrick universities, were founded in provincial cities as non-residential university colleges in the later 19th and early 20th century. The newer or smaller civic universities, sometimes called &quot;white tile&quot; universities, were founded later. &quot;Redbrick&quot; is sometimes used to mean any university established between 1800 and 1960, or between 1800 and 1992. Scott, unusually, uses &quot;redbrick&quot; to refer to the younger civics universities.
* &quot;Plate glass universities&quot; were created in the 1960s as residential universities with degree-awarding powers from the start, in contrast to being created as university colleges. The UGC took the decision to create these universities in the late 1950s and early 1960s, prior to the Robbins Report. The Scottish University of Stirling was the only entirely new university created as a result of the Robbins Report, and is often considered (e.g. by Scott) as a Scottish equivalent of the plate glass universities.
* &quot;Technological universities&quot; were created from the colleges of advanced technology as a result of the recommendations of the 1963 Robbins Report and are thus also known as Robbins expansion universities.
* &quot;Old universities&quot; refers to institutions that were part of the university sector prior to 1992, including full colleges of the federal universities of London and Wales in 1992.
* &quot;New universities&quot; or &quot;post-1992 universities&quot; are institutions that entered the university sector following the passing of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, including former Polytechnics, colleges and institutes of higher education, and other higher education corporations, but not older university institutions that were part of the university sector as colleges of the universities of London or Wales (e.g., Imperial College or Cardiff University). More recent classifications divide the post-1992 universities into those (mainly former polytechnics) that became universities after the 1992 act and other colleges that became universities after the Higher Education Act 2004.
* &quot;Scottish universities&quot;, &quot;Welsh universities&quot; and &quot;Northern Irish universities&quot; form three of Scott&#x27;s twelve categories, with the other nine consisting solely of English universities, although he does allow for the Scottish category to be subdivided into ancient, civic, technological, &quot;old &#x27;new (plate glass), and &quot;new &#x27;new (post-1992). The four Scottish universities founded in the 1960s (covering Scott&#x27;s sub-categories of civic, technological and &quot;old &#x27;new) are sometimes termed the Scottish chartered universities.

Some universities are hard to categorise. Durham University is particularly challenging, being treated variously as an ancient university, an older/larger civic or a smaller civic. Maclean, who classified it as &quot;ancient&quot;, noted that: &quot;Several Englishmen have been surprised that Durham should be grouped with Oxford and Cambridge, rather than with the newer English universities, since it was founded in 1832. In fact, in its Durham division it is an inchoate Oxford or Cambridge, the third of the ancient universities in England, brought forth after an interval of 700 years as one born out of due time.&quot; The grouping of Durham and other pre-redbrick universities with the ancient universities may also sometimes be termed &quot;pre-Victorian&quot; or (by analogy to redbrick) &quot;grey brick&quot;. Durham is also sometimes classified, on the grounds of age, as a larger or older civic university. Watts, who categorises Durham among the large civic universities, notes that: &quot;Objection … may be made to the inclusion of Durham with the larger civic universities, which is made primarily on age grounds and in spite of the fact that in terms of structure and academic tradition Durham is probably rather closer to Oxbridge. The Robbins Committee (1963) rejected both these arguments and paid more attention to the criterion of size, including Durham with the smaller civic universities&quot;. The main report of the Robbins Committee, however, classified Durham as the oldest of the older civic universities. The UGC joined Durham with London to form a separate group between the ancient and civic universities, while others have considered &quot;redbrick&quot; to include London and Durham along with the civic universities, but excluding the technological and plate glass universities from the 1960s. Whyte, in his history of Redbrick universities, considers Durham, along with St David&#x27;s College, Lampeter as a religiously-exclusive, residential, university institution, following the Oxbridge pattern and separated from the development of the redbrick universities and from the London colleges. Scott classifies Lampeter with the other Welsh universities and Durham as &quot;sui generis&quot;.

The University of Dundee is similarly sometimes joined with the ancient universities of Scotland. Watts places it here, while noting that &quot;there might … be dispute about the inclusion of Dundee with the ancient Scottish universities&quot;. Whyte considered it to be a redbrick university, while Scott considered it to be the only Scottish civic university.

The University of Keele is also categorised by Scott as &quot;sui generis&quot; on the basis that it was &quot;bravely designed in the 1940s up provide a broad undergraduate education but with an extra-mural twist to reflect its Potteries location&quot;. As Durham lies between the ancient and civic universities, Keele lies between the civic and plate glass universities. Watts identifies it among the plate glass universities, but it was a former university college (founded in 1949 and promoted to a university in 1962) not a new institution founded as a university. The Robbins report classified it as newer civic university.

Many categorisations do not include the Open University, the UK&#x27;s open-access distance learning university at all, while Scott considers it to form its own category of institution. The private University of Buckingham, founded in 1973 and made a university by royal charter in 1983, is not considered by either Scott or by Bligh, McNay and Thomas, but Watson assigns it to a separate category of private universities. The colleges (and now former colleges) of the federal universities of London and Wales are also normally omitted – it is only the parent university that is categorised.

===Mission groups===
These are actual groupings with defined memberships:
* Russell Group – self-selected association of 24 public research universities.
* MillionPlus – coalition of post-1992 universities
* University Alliance – coalition of &quot;business engaged&quot; (mostly) post-1992 universities.
* Cathedrals Group – coalition of (mostly) new universities with historic links to one or more of the Christian churches.
* Independent Universities Group – private universities.
* Independent Higher Education – private universities and higher education providers.

===Categorisation by structure===
* Unitary universities – the standard structure, with all teaching and services provided by the central University. Long standard in Scotland, the first unitary university in England was Birmingham in 1900.
* Examining Board universities – modelled on the separation of teaching in College and examination by the Senate House in the University of Cambridge, the University of London (1836–1900) and the Royal University of Ireland (1880–1909) were set up to function purely as examining boards; there are no current universities in this category.
* Federal universities – Starting with the Queen&#x27;s University of Ireland (1850–1880) a number of universities have been federal in nature, including the Victoria University (1880–1904), the University of Wales (1893–2007), Durham University (1909–1963) and the Federal University of Surrey (2000–2004); the only current federal universities in the UK are the University of London (from 1900) and the University of the Highlands and Islands (from 2011).
* Collegiate universities – the classical Oxbridge model of a university containing a number of colleges. In addition to Oxford and Cambridge, this has been adopted by Durham, York, and Lancaster, although these differ from the Oxbridge model in that there is no teaching in their colleges. The University of Roehampton and the University of the Arts London are also collegiate, with teaching taking place in academic departments associated with the colleges. Federal universities are also sometimes referred to as collegiate.

===Statistical categorisation===

Research by Vikki Boliver in 2015 used cluster analysis to divide UK universities into four clusters based on how elite they were using data on academic selectivity, research activity, teaching quality, socio-economic exclusivity and economic resources. The first cluster consisted of only Oxford and Cambridge. The second cluster contained the remaining universities from the Russell Group along with the former members of the defunct 1994 Group (except for the University of Essex), all of the pre-1992 universities in Scotland, and the University of Kent. The third cluster was the remaining pre-1992 universities (with the exception of the University of Wales Trinity Saint David (UWTSD), which is technically pre-1992 as it operates under the University of Wales, Lampeter&#x27;s 1828 Royal Charter), many of the former polytechnics and central institutions, and a few former HE colleges that became university colleges and then universities after the polytechnics. The fourth cluster has the remaining polytechnics and the majority of the former HE colleges, along with UWTSD.

Research England carried out a cluster analysis of English universities in 2018 as part of is preparation for the Knowledge Exchange Framework. This used three key dimensions: existing knowledge base, knowledge generation and physical assets. Ninety nine broad-discipline institutions were classified using the cluster analysis, with heuristics (and in one case manual intervention) being used to identify specialist institutions based on concentration of academics; these were manually assigned by field of specialisation to STEM (subdivided into biosciences and veterinary (5 institutions), engineering (1 institution), and agriculture (3 institutions)), social sciences and business (5 institutions), and arts and design (18 institutions). The cluster analysis identified five clusters, randomly assigned labels to avoid implying any ranking of which cluster was &quot;better&quot;. The key characteristics of the clusters were:
* Cluster E (29 institutions): &quot;Large universities with broad discipline portfolio across both STEM and non-STEM generating a mid-level amount of world-leading research across all disciplines. Significant amount of research funded by gov&#x27;t bodies/hospitals; 9.5% from industry. Large proportion of part-time undergraduate students, and small postgraduate population dominated by taught postgraduates.&quot;
* Cluster J (17 institutions): &quot;Mid-sized universities with limited funded research activity and generating limited world-leading research. Academic activity across STEM and non-STEM including other health, computer sciences, architecture/planning, social sciences and business, humanities, arts and design. Research activity funded largely by government bodies/hospitals; 13.7% from industry.&quot;
* Cluster M (17 institutions): &quot;Small universities with limited funded research activity and generating limited world-leading research. Academic activity across disciplines, particularly in other health domains and non-STEM. Much of research activity funded by gov&#x27;t bodies/hospitals; 14.7% from industry.&quot;
* Cluster V (16 institutions): &quot;Very large, very high research intensive and broad-discipline universities undertaking significant amounts of world-leading research. Research funded by range of sources incl. RCs, gov&#x27;t bodies, charities and 10.2% from industry. Discipline portfolio: significant activity in clinical medicine and STEM. Student body includes significant numbers of taught and research postgraduates.&quot;
* Cluster X (20 institutions): &quot;Large, high research intensive and broad-discipline universities undertaking a significant amount of world-leading research. Much of research funded by RCs and gov&#x27;t bodies; 8.5% from industry. Discipline portfolio balanced across STEM and non-STEM with less or no clinical medicine activity. Large proportion of taught postgraduates in student population.&quot;

==Employment in higher education==
In December 2018, nearly 440,000 people worked in the higher education sector. According to research by the University and College Union, in 2019/20 around 220,000 academic staff were employed in UK higher education institutions; a third of these were on fixed-term contracts. In 2022, there were 240,420 employed in the sector.

==Admission==

The universities in the United Kingdom (with the exception of The Open University) share an undergraduate admission system operated by UCAS. Applications are normally made during the final year of secondary school, prior to students receiving their final results, with schools providing predicted grades for their students. Applications should be made by 15 January to the majority of undergraduate courses, but by 15 October for admissions to most courses in medicine, dentistry and veterinary science, and for all courses at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge. Some art and design courses have a later deadline of 24 March. Applications received up to 30 June are sent to universities, after this date they go straight into Clearing. Offers are made by early May for applications received by 15 January and by mid July for applications received by 30 June. Applicants who apply late, do not receive or accept any offers, or who do not meet the conditions of their offer, go into Clearing, which opens in early July although it is busiest directly after A-level results are announced. Most UK providers advertise courses they have not filled during the standard application period through Clearing.

Around half of British universities had one or more courses that require an entrance examination as of 2012 in addition to secondary school qualifications. These include many medicine and dentistry courses as well as popular courses in law and mathematics. Some highly competitive courses also require students to attend an interview or audition.

Many universities now operate the Credit Accumulation and Transfer Scheme (CATS) and all universities in Scotland use the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF) enabling easier transfer between courses and institutions.

==Reputation==

British higher education has a strong international reputation, with over half of international students citing this as one of the main factors in deciding to study in the UK (compared to 22 percent of international students studying in Canada, 21 percent in Australia and 15 percent in the US). London has also been ranked as the best city in the world for students. However, a number of universities, including Cambridge, UCL and the LSE, have warned that Brexit poses a reputational risk for UK universities, and there are also fears about the impact of the government&#x27;s immigration and visa policy.

Domestic rankings of universities in the UK were first introduced in 1993 by The Times Good University Guide. Today, there are three main domestic league tables published by The Times and Sunday Times, The Guardian, and the Complete University Guide. Each year since 2008, Times Higher Education has compiled a &quot;Table of Tables&quot; to combine the results of the three mainstream league tables. In the 2018 table, the top-five universities were the University of Cambridge, University of Oxford, University of St Andrews, Imperial College London and Durham University.

In the 2020 Times Higher Education World University Rankings, Oxford was placed first, Cambridge third, and Imperial tenth; while the 2020 top fifty also included UCL at fifteenth, LSE at 27th, Edinburgh at 30th, and King&#x27;s College London at 36th. A further four UK universities (eleven in total) rank in the top 100. Oxford, Cambridge and Imperial have been consistently ranked in the top ten on this table.

In the QS World University Rankings, Oxford (fourth in 2020), Cambridge (seventh), UCL (eighth), and Imperial (ninth) are consistently present in the top ten. Edinburgh (20th), Manchester (27th), King&#x27;s College London (33rd), LSE (44th), and Bristol (49th) also make the top fifty and a further nine UK universities (eighteen total) make the top 100.

The &quot;Academic Ranking of World Universities&quot; also places Cambridge (third in 2019) and Oxford (seventh) consistently in the world top ten. University College London (15th), Imperial College London (23rd), the University of Edinburgh (31st), and the University of Manchester (33rd) also make the top 50 and two more UK universities (eight total) are in the top 100.

In specific subject rankings, UK universities have performed well with a quarter of all top rankings taken by British Universities in the QS 2017 rankings. The University of Oxford is rated top in most subjects among British universities, with the Royal College of Art first in the world for art and design, the Institute of Education, part of University College London, for education, University of Sussex for Development Studies and Loughborough University for sports-related subjects.

In August 2019, the &quot;New Statesman&quot; magazine published a cover story, later reprinted by &quot;The Week&quot;, arguing that British universities have suffered from decades of grade inflation, and from a set of perverse incentives imposed by successive governments: &quot;An elite university education has been sold to successive generations of students. An emaciated, grossly expanded education has been delivered.&quot;

==Peculiarities==
In England and Wales the majority of young full-time university students live away from home, which is not the case for universities in some, mainly Southern European, countries such as Italy and Spain. Most universities in the United Kingdom provide (or at least help organise) rented accommodation for many of their students, particularly in the first year; some British universities provide accommodation for the full duration of their courses. As a result, the lifestyle of university students in the United Kingdom can be quite different from those of some European universities where the majority of students live at home with their parents. The introduction of university fees paid by students from 2006 onwards has led many English and Welsh students to apply to institutions closer to their family&#x27;s homes to reduce the additional costs of moving and living farther away.

The University of London from its reform in 1900, and the University of Wales from its inception in 1893 until its reform in 2007, have been federal universities. They have a central governing body with overall responsibility for the maintenance of standards at the constituent colleges. Recently, however, there has been considerable pressure from the larger colleges to become more autonomous and, in some cases, completely independent institutions. Examples of this were the secession of Imperial College London from the University of London and Cardiff University leaving the University of Wales. Cardiff&#x27;s departure and policies pursued by the Welsh Government have led to the break-up of the University of Wales, which is in the process of merging with the University of Wales Trinity Saint David, with an expected completion date of 2017.

The London School of Economics (a college of the University of London) was founded as a company registered at Companies House, having no royal charter or founding Act of Parliament. The University of Buckingham was the only private university in the UK until 2012.

Two universities, Bishop Grosseteste University in Lincoln and the University of Chester, are unincorporated trusts under the trusteeship of their local Church of England dioceses.

The University of Warwick, originally to be named the University of Warwickshire when it was established in 1965, is several miles from Warwick, the county town, and is situated on the southern edge of Coventry in the West Midlands county. Following the county boundary changes, Warwick University&#x27;s campus straddles the Warwickshire and city of Coventry boundary, although many of its students live in the nearby towns of Kenilworth and Leamington Spa, Warwickshire.

John Banks Jenkinson was petitioner for the royal charters of both the University of Wales Trinity Saint David (granted in 1828) and Durham University (granted in 1837), as Bishop of St David&#x27;s and Dean of Durham.

In common with practice worldwide, graduates of universities in the United Kingdom often place not only their academic qualifications but also the names of the universities that awarded them after their name, the university typically (but not universally) being placed in parentheses, thus: &quot;John Smith, Esq, BSc (Sheffield)&quot;, or &quot;John Smith BSc Sheffield&quot;. Degrees are generally listed in ascending order of seniority followed by diplomas. An exception may be made when a degree of a different university falls between two degrees of the same university: &quot;John Smith, MSci (York), PhD (London)&quot;; &quot;Jane Smoth BA, PhD (London), MA (Bristol)&quot;.

Some older British universities are regularly denoted by an abbreviation of their Latin name. Notably &quot;Oxon&quot;, &quot;Cantab&quot;, &quot;Dunelm&quot; are used for the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge and Durham, which are different from the English abbreviation. For other universities, such as &quot;St And&quot; for St Andrews, &quot;Glas&quot; for Glasgow, &quot;Aberd&quot; for Aberdeen, &quot;Edin&quot; for Edinburgh or &quot;Lond&quot; for University of London, the Latin and English abbreviations are identical (both &quot;Aberdon&quot; and &quot;Londin&quot;
are used occasionally, making the Latin explicit). More recently established universities also sometimes use Latin abbreviations, especially when they share the name of an episcopal see, in which case they sometimes use the same abbreviation that the bishop uses for his signature.

On 30 March 2007 the University of Oxford issued a document entitled &quot;&quot;Oxford University Calendar&quot;: Notes on Style&quot;, which promulgated a new system of abbreviations for use in publications of that university. The general rule is to use the first syllable and the first letter of the second syllable. Thus Oxford and Cambridge became &#x27;Oxf&#x27; and &#x27;Camb&#x27;. The change was controversial (p. 2, n. 1) but was considered essential to preserve consistency since most of the United Kingdom&#x27;s universities can be rendered only in English. This document also counsels against the use of parentheses.

==Value of academic degrees==
A study by the Sutton Trust in 2015 found that, after taking student loan repayments into account, a higher apprenticeship (at level 5 in the national qualifications frameworks) delivered higher lifetime earnings on average than a degree from a non-Russell Group university. Despite this, polling for the report found that apprenticeships have a lower perceived value than degrees.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies has found that, after controlling for differences in student characteristics, graduates in medicine and economics earn (on average) 20% more and graduates in business, computing and architecture 10% more than average graduates, while graduates in creative arts earn 15% less. It also found that there is a wide variation in graduate earnings within subjects, even between graduates with the same degree from the same institution. One reason for this variation is the wealth of graduates&#x27; family backgrounds, but subject and institution choice as well as prior education attainment level can be a more significant determinant.

A 2017 study by the Office for National Statistics found that, although university graduates are consistently more likely to be employed than non-graduates, they are increasingly likely to be overqualified for the jobs which they do hold. In peak earning years, a university graduate will earn an average of £36,000 per year, an apprentice will earn £30,000 per year, an A-level graduate will earn £24,000 per year, while someone without an A-level will earn £20,000 per year. Breaking down the university degrees into separate professions, undergraduates in engineering or medicine earn the most at £44,500 per year, while undergraduates in the arts earn the least at £20,700 per year. Finally, Russell Group graduates hold 61% of all jobs that require a university degree, despite being only 17% of all higher education graduates.

The Intergenerational Foundation found in a 2018 paper that the &quot;graduate premium&quot; had fallen to around £100,000 averaged across all subjects, degree classes and universities, although with such a wide variation by subject and institution that it was impossible to quantify in a meaningful way. They argue that the graduate premium has been diluted by the large number of graduates, in particular those with non-vocational degrees from non-elite institutions. Making matters worse, employers have responded to the oversupply of graduates by raising the academic requirements of many occupations higher than is really necessary to perform the work. Further study of the graduate premium by the Higher Education Statistics Agency and Warwick University shows that, while graduates born in 1970 earned 19% more than their non-graduate peers, the premium has fallen to 11% for graduates born in 1990.

In a 2018 study, the National Audit Office reported that, although some progress has been made in increasing STEM subject enrollment since 2011, the progress does not match labour market demand. For example, too many students are seeking a degree in the biological sciences, while the shortage in STEM apprentices has seen little improvement. In particular, women have shown scant interest in acquiring high-demand skills such as a computer science degree.

A 2018 study by the Office for National Statistics found that one in eight young people without degree-level qualifications are working in graduate jobs. Most of these jobs are in sales, human resources, and retail and wholesale management. In these fields, on-the-job training can be an effective substitute for formal qualifications.

A 2020 study by the Department for Education found that the median annual earnings of university graduates, five years into their careers, ranged from £20,800 in the creative arts and design to £49,450 in medicine and dentistry.

==Academic standards==
Concern exists about possible grade inflation. It is claimed that academics are under increasing pressure from administrators to award students good marks and grades with little regard for those students&#x27; actual abilities, in order to maintain their league table rankings. The percentage of graduates who receive a First has grown from 7% in 1997 to 26% in 2017, with the rate of growth sharply accelerating toward the end of this period. A 2018 study by the &quot;UK Standing Committee for Quality Assessment&quot; concluded that improvements in faculty skill and student motivation are only two of many factors driving average grades upward, that grade inflation is real, that the British undergraduate degree classifications will become less useful to students and employers, and that inflation will undermine public confidence in the overall value of higher education. Many students believe that a First or upper Second, by itself, is no longer sufficient to secure a good job, and that their CVs must include additional experiences, such as extracurricular activity, to remain competitive.

The Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) regularly reviews all UK universities to ensure standards are maintained. It is also responsible for producing subject benchmark statements and descriptions of the different degree levels (foundation, bachelor&#x27;s master&#x27;s and doctorates). The QAA also certifies that British degrees (with the exception of Oxbridge MAs, which it does not consider to be academic degrees) meet the level descriptors for the Bologna process, with the caveat that initial medical degrees are at master&#x27;s level but retain the name of bachelor&#x27;s degrees for historical reasons and that similarly the MAs of &quot;a small number of universities&quot; in Scotland are at bachelor&#x27;s level.
In some subjects (particularly those with associated chartered status), professional bodies also accredit degrees, e.g. the Institute of Physics accredits physics degrees.

<text>Marianne Fredriksson, née Persson (March 28, 1927 in Gothenburg – February 11, 2007 in Österskär) was a Swedish author who worked and lived in Roslagen and Stockholm. Before becoming a novelist, she was a journalist for various Swedish newspapers and magazines, including &quot;Svenska Dagbladet&quot;.

Fredriksson published fifteen novels, most of which have been translated into English, German, Dutch, and other languages. Most of her earlier books are based on biblical stories. A central theme in her writings is friendship, because as she maintained, &quot;friendship will be more important than love&quot; in the future.

<doc id="81520" wikidata="Q3621681" url="?curid=81520" title="Reverse speech">
<text>Reverse speech is a pseudoscientific topic first advocated by David John Oates which gained publicity when it was mentioned on Art Bell&#x27;s nightly Coast to Coast AM radio talk show. It is based upon the theory that during spoken language production, human speakers subconsciously produce hidden messages that give insights into their innermost thoughts. Oates claims that it therefore has applications in psychotherapy, criminology and business negotiation. The theory has been rejected by mainstream science and academia.

==Claims==

Oates&#x27; claim is that, on average, once in every 15–20 seconds of casual conversation a person produces two related sentences—a &quot;forward-spoken&quot; message that is heard consciously, and a &quot;backwards&quot; message unconsciously embedded in the person&#x27;s speech. These two modes of speech, forward and backward, are supposedly dependent upon each other and form an integral part of human communication. In the dynamics of interpersonal communication, both modes of speech combine to communicate the total psyche of the person, conscious as well as unconscious. Oates claims that backward speech is always honest and reveals the truth about the speaker&#x27;s intentions and motivations. The most famous recording that allegedly demonstrates this is the speech given by Neil Armstrong at the time of the first human lunar landing on 20 July 1969. If played backwards, the words &quot;small step for man&quot; sound somewhat like &quot;Man will spacewalk.&quot;

An alternative explanation for this phenomenon is pareidolia, the tendency of the human brain to perceive meaningful patterns in random noise. Pareidolia is even more likely to occur when a person consciously tries to detect a pattern, as is the case for someone listening for intelligible phrases in backwards speech. The power of suggestion is then used to nudge the listener to hear what the presenter wants him to hear. David John Oates, for example, almost always tells the listener in advance what he should expect to hear, thereby planting a suggestion that would make the listener more likely to actually &quot;hear&quot; that phrase. A study has shown that when listening to the same clips without being told in advance what to expect, the results have a higher variation.

==Rejection by the scientific community==
Most academics in the field of linguistics have not paid attention to Oates&#x27; work, and it has been called a pseudoscience. For the most part, universities and research institutes have refused to test Oates&#x27; theories because of a lack of theoretical basis to make his predictions even worth testing, and the fact that many of his claims are untestable, but one of the few scientific experiments to evaluate Oates&#x27; claims did not support his findings. Others have criticized &quot;reverse speech&quot; as lacking a rigorous methodology and not being informed by an understanding of issues in linguistics, and characterized Oates as &quot;more interested in making a profit than educating others,&quot; pointing out the large amount of merchandise and services his website sells. Reverse speech has been compared to the controversial field (labelled a pseudoscience by some) of neuro-linguistic programming. Because of the &quot;dogmatic&quot; tone of Oates&#x27; material, reverse speech has been compared to &quot;fringe literature.&quot;

Oates&#x27; own claims about the applications of reverse speech have also been challenged. One report has questioned whether reverse speech was ever really used in police work, as Oates claimed. Likewise, his claim that reverse speech has applications in psychology and psychotherapy is not supported by mainstream research in those fields. Oates&#x27; work has been described as &quot;dangerous&quot; because of its potential for misuse and the likelihood of leading to false accusations of people in criminal courts, similarly to the controversial practice of facilitated communication.

<text>Teotihuacan (; Spanish: Teotihuacán, ; ) is an ancient Mesoamerican city located in a sub-valley of the Valley of Mexico, which is located in the State of Mexico, northeast of modern-day Mexico City.

Teotihuacan is known today as the site of many of the most architecturally significant Mesoamerican pyramids built in the pre-Columbian Americas, namely the Pyramid of the Sun and the Pyramid of the Moon. Although close to Mexico City, Teotihuacan was not a Mexica (i.e. Aztec) city, and it predates the Aztec Empire by many centuries. At its zenith, perhaps in the first half of the first millennium (1 CE to 500 CE), Teotihuacan was the largest city in the Americas, with a population of at least 25,000, but has been estimated at 125,000 or more, making it at least the sixth-largest city in the world during its epoch.

The city covered   and 80 to 90 percent of the total population of the valley resided in Teotihuacan. Apart from the pyramids, Teotihuacan is also anthropologically significant for its complex, multi-family residential compounds, the Avenue of the Dead, and its vibrant, well-preserved murals. Additionally, Teotihuacan exported fine obsidian tools found throughout Mesoamerica. The city is thought to have been established around 100 BCE, with major monuments continuously under construction until about 250 CE. The city may have lasted until sometime between the 7th and 8th centuries CE, but its major monuments were sacked and systematically burned around 550 CE. Its collapse might be related to the extreme weather events of 535–536.

Teotihuacan began as a religious center in the Mexican Plateau around the first century CE. It became the largest and most populated center in the pre-Columbian Americas. Teotihuacan was home to multi-floor apartment compounds built to accommodate the large population. The term Teotihuacan (or Teotihuacano) is also used to refer to the whole civilization and cultural complex associated with the site.

Although it is a subject of debate whether Teotihuacan was the center of a state empire, its influence throughout Mesoamerica is well documented. Evidence of Teotihuacano presence is found at numerous sites in Veracruz and the Maya region. The later Aztecs saw these magnificent ruins and claimed a common ancestry with the Teotihuacanos, modifying and adopting aspects of their culture. The ethnicity of the inhabitants of Teotihuacan is the subject of debate. Possible candidates are the Nahua, Otomi, or Totonac ethnic groups. Other scholars have suggested that Teotihuacan was multi-ethnic, due to the discovery of cultural aspects connected to the Maya as well as Oto-Pamean people. It is clear that many different cultural groups lived in Teotihuacan during the height of its power, with migrants coming from all over, but especially from Oaxaca and the Gulf Coast.

After the collapse of Teotihuacan, central Mexico was dominated by more regional powers, notably Xochicalco and Tula.

The city and the archeological site are located in what is now the San Juan Teotihuacán municipality in the State of México, approximately northeast of Mexico City. The site covers a total surface area of and was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987. It is the most-visited archeological site in Mexico, receiving 4,185,017 visitors in 2017.

==Etymology==
The name was given by the Nahuatl-speaking Aztecs centuries after the fall of the city around 550 CE. The term has been glossed as &quot;birthplace of the gods&quot;, or &quot;place where gods were born&quot;, reflecting Nahua creation myths that were said to occur in Teotihuacan. Nahuatl scholar Thelma D. Sullivan interprets the name as &quot;place of those who have the road of the gods.&quot; This is because the Aztecs believed that the gods created the universe at that site. The name is pronounced in Nahuatl, with the stress on the syllable . By normal Nahuatl orthographic conventions, a written accent mark would not appear in that position. Both this pronunciation and the Spanish pronunciation are used; in Spanish and usually English, the stress falls on the final syllable.

The original name of the city is unknown, but it appears in hieroglyphic texts from the Maya region as , or &quot;Place of Reeds&quot;. This suggests that, in the Maya civilization of the Classic period, Teotihuacan was understood as a Place of Reeds similar to other Postclassic Central Mexican settlements that took the name of , such as and .

This naming convention led to much confusion in the early 20th century, as scholars debated whether &quot;Teotihuacan&quot; or &quot;Tula-Hidalgo&quot; was the &quot;Tollan&quot; described by 16th-century chronicles. It now seems clear that may be understood as a generic Nahua term applied to any large settlement. In the Mesoamerican concept of urbanism, and other language equivalents serve as a metaphor, linking the bundles of reeds and rushes that formed part of the lacustrine environment of the Valley of Mexico and the large gathering of people in a city.

As of January 23, 2018, the name &quot;Teotihuacan&quot; has come under scrutiny by experts, who now feel that the site&#x27;s name may have been changed by Spanish colonizers in the 16th century. Archeologist Verónica Ortega of the National Institute of Anthropology and History states that the city appears to have actually been named &quot;Teohuacan&quot;, meaning &quot;City of the Sun&quot; rather than &quot;City of the Gods&quot;, as the current name suggests.

==History==

===Historical course===
The first human establishment in the Teotihuacan area dates back to 600 BCE, and until 200 BCE the site consisted of scattered small villages. The total estimated population of the Teotihuacan Valley during this time was approximately 6,000. From 100 BCE to 750 CE, Teotihuacan evolved into a huge urban and administrative center with cultural influences throughout the broader Mesoamerica region.

The history of Teotihuacan is distinguished by four consecutive periods:

Period I occurred between 200 - 1 BCE and marks the development of a distinctively urban area. During this period, Teotihuacan began to grow into a city as local farmers began coalescing around the abundant springs of Teotihuacan.

Period II lasted between 1 CE to 350 CE. During this era, &quot;Teotihuacan&quot; exhibited explosive growth and emerged as the largest metropolis in Mesoamerica. Factors influencing this growth include the destruction of other settlements due to volcanic eruptions and the economic pull of the expanding city. This influx of new residents caused a reorganization of urban housing to the unique compound complexes that typify Teotihuacan. This period is notable for its monumental architecture and sculpture, especially the construction of some of the most well-known sites of &quot;Teotihuacan&quot;, the Pyramids of the Sun and Moon. Further, the shift of political power from the Temple of the Feathered Serpent and its surrounding palace structure to the Avenue of the Dead Complex occurred sometime between CE 250 and 350. Some authors believe that this represents a shift from the centralized, monarchical political system to a more decentralized and bureaucratic organization. Around 300 CE, the Temple of the Feathered Serpent was desecrated and construction in the city proceeded in a more egalitarian direction, focusing on the building of comfortable, stone accommodations for the population&quot;.&quot;

Period III lasted from 350 to 650 CE and is known as the classical period of Teotihuacan, during which the city reached the apogee of influence in Mesoamerica. Its population is estimated at a minimum of 125,000 inhabitants, and the city was among the largest cities in the ancient world, containing 2,000 buildings within an area of 18 square kilometers. It was also during this high period when Teotihuacan contained approximately half all people in the Valley of Mexico, becoming a kind of primate city of Mesoamerica. This period saw a massive reconstruction of buildings, and the Temple of the Feathered Serpent, which dates back to the previous period, was covered with a plaza with rich sculptural decoration. Typical artistic artifacts of this period are funeral masks, crafted mainly from green stone and covered with mosaics of turquoise, shell or obsidian. These masks were highly uniform in nature.

Period IV describes the time period between 650 and 750 CE. It marks the end of Teotihuacan as a major power in Mesoamerica. The city&#x27;s elite housing compounds, clustered around the Avenue of the Dead, bear many burn marks, and archeologists hypothesize that the city experienced civil strife that hastened its decline. Factors that also led to the decline of the city included disruptions in tributary relations, increased social stratification, and power struggles between the ruling and intermediary elites. Following this decline, Teotihuacan continued to be inhabited, though it never reached its previous levels of population.

===Origins and foundation===
The early history of Teotihuacan is quite mysterious, and the origin of its founders is uncertain. Around 300 BCE, people of the central and southeastern areas of Mesoamerica began to gather into larger settlements. Teotihuacan was the largest urban center of Mesoamerica before the Aztecs, almost 1000 years prior to their epoch. The city was already in ruins by the time of the Aztecs. For many years, archeologists believed it was built by the Toltec. This belief was based on colonial period texts, such as the Florentine Codex, which attributed the site to the Toltecs. However, the Nahuatl word &quot;Toltec&quot; generally means &quot;craftsman of the highest level&quot; and may not always refer to the Toltec civilization centered at Tula, Hidalgo. Since Toltec civilization flourished centuries after Teotihuacan, the people could not have been the city&#x27;s founders.

In the Late Formative era, a number of urban centers arose in central Mexico. The most prominent of these appears to have been Cuicuilco, on the southern shore of Lake Texcoco. Scholars have speculated that the eruption of the Xitle volcano may have prompted a mass emigration out of the central valley and into the Teotihuacan valley. These settlers may have founded or accelerated the growth of Teotihuacan.

Other scholars have put forth the Totonac people as the founders of Teotihuacan and have suggested that Teotihuacan was a multi-ethnic state since they find diverse cultural aspects connected to the Zapotec, Mixtec, and Maya peoples. The builders of Teotihuacan took advantage of the geography in the Basin of Mexico. From the swampy ground, they constructed raised beds, called chinampas, creating high agricultural productivity despite old methods of cultivation. This allowed for the formation of channels, and subsequently canoe traffic, to transport food from farms around the city. The earliest buildings at Teotihuacan date to about 200 BCE. The largest pyramid, the Pyramid of the Sun, was completed by 100 CE.

===Year 378: Conquest of Tikal===
Evidence of a king or other authoritarian ruler is strikingly absent in Teotihuacan. Contemporaneous cities in the same region, including Mayan and Zapotec, as well as the earlier Olmec civilization, left ample attestations of dynastic authoritarian sovereignty in the form of royal palaces, ceremonial ball courts, and depictions of war, conquest, and humiliated captives. However, no such artifacts have been found in Teotihuacan. Many scholars have thus concluded that Teotihuacan was led by some sort of &quot;collective governance.&quot;

In January 378, the warlord Sihyaj K&#x27;ahk&#x27; (literally, &quot;born of fire&quot;), depicted with artifacts and the feather-serpent imagery associated with Teotihuacan culture, conquered Tikal, 600 miles away from Teotihuacan, removing and replacing the Maya king, with support from El Peru and Naachtun, as recorded by Stela 31 at Tikal and other monuments in the Maya region. At this time, the Spearthrower Owl ruler was also associated with Teotihuacan culture. Linda R. Manzanilla wrote in 2015:


===Year 426: Conquest of Copán and Quiriguá===
In 426, the Copán ruling dynasty was created with K&#x27;inich Yax K&#x27;uk&#x27; Mo&#x27; as the first king. The Dynasty went on to have sixteen rulers. Copán is located in modern-day Honduras, as described by Copán Altar Q. Soon thereafter, Yax K&#x27;uk&#x27; Mo&#x27; installed Tok Casper as king of Quiriguá, about 50 km north of Copán.

===Zenith===
The city reached its peak in 450 CE when it was the center of a powerful culture whose influence extended through much of the Mesoamerican region. At this time, the city covered over 30 km (over square miles), and perhaps housed a population of 150,000 people, with one estimate reaching as high as 250,000. Various districts in the city housed people from across the Teotihuacan region of influence, which spread south as far as Guatemala. Notably absent from the city are fortifications and military structures.

The nature of political and cultural interactions between Teotihuacan and the centers of the Maya region (as well as elsewhere in Mesoamerica) has been a long-standing and significant area for debate. Substantial exchange and interaction occurred over the centuries from the Terminal Preclassic to the Mid-Classic period. &quot;Teotihuacan-inspired ideologies&quot; and motifs persisted at Maya centers into the Late Classic, long after Teotihuacan itself had declined. However, scholars debate the extent and degree of Teotihuacan influence. Some believe that it had direct and militaristic dominance while others view the adoption of &quot;foreign&quot; traits as part of a selective, conscious, and bi-directional cultural diffusion. New discoveries have suggested that Teotihuacan was not much different in its interactions with other centers from the later empires, such as the Toltec and Aztec. It is believed that Teotihuacan had a major influence on the Preclassic and Classic Maya.


Architectural styles prominent at Teotihuacan are found widely dispersed at a number of distant Mesoamerican sites, which some researchers have interpreted as evidence for Teotihuacan&#x27;s far-reaching interactions and political or militaristic dominance. A style particularly associated with Teotihuacan is known as &quot;talud-tablero&quot;, in which an inwards-sloping external side of a structure (&quot;talud&quot;) is surmounted by a rectangular panel (&quot;tablero&quot;). Variants of the generic style are found in a number of Maya region sites including Tikal, Kaminaljuyu, Copan, Becan, and Oxkintok, and particularly in the Petén Basin and the central Guatemalan highlands. The &quot;talud-tablero&quot; style pre-dates its earliest appearance at Teotihuacan in the Early Classic period; it appears to have originated in the Tlaxcala-Puebla region during the Preclassic. Analyses have traced the development into local variants of the &quot;talud-tablero&quot; style at sites such as Tikal, where its use precedes the 5th-century appearance of iconographic motifs shared with Teotihuacan. The &quot;talud-tablero&quot; style disseminated through Mesoamerica generally from the end of the Preclassic period, and not specifically, or solely, via Teotihuacano influence. It is unclear how or from where the style spread into the Maya region. During its zenith, the main structures at Teotihuacan, including the pyramids, were painted in impressive shades of dark red, with some small spots persisting to this day.

The city was a center of industry, home to many potters, jewelers, and craftspeople. Teotihuacan is known for producing a great number of obsidian artifacts. No ancient Teotihuacano non-ideographic texts are known to exist (or known to have once existed). Inscriptions from Maya cities show that Teotihuacan nobility traveled to, and perhaps conquered, local rulers as far away as Honduras. Maya inscriptions note an individual named by scholars as &quot;Spearthrower Owl&quot;, apparently ruler of Teotihuacan, who reigned for over 60 years and installed his relatives as rulers of Tikal and Uaxactun in Guatemala.

Scholars have based interpretations of Teotihuacan culture on its archeology, murals that adorn the site (and others, like the Wagner Murals, found in private collections), and hieroglyphic inscriptions made by the Maya describing their encounters with Teotihuacan conquerors. The creation of murals, perhaps tens of thousands of murals, reached its height between 450 and 650. The artistry of the painters was unrivaled in Mesoamerica and has been compared with that of painters in Renaissance Florence, Italy.

=== Collapse ===
Scholars originally thought that invaders attacked the city in the 7th or 8th century, sacking and burning it. More recent evidence, however, seems to indicate that the burning was limited to the structures and dwellings associated primarily with the ruling class. Some think this suggests that the burning was from an internal uprising and the invasion theory is flawed because early archeological efforts were focused exclusively on the palaces and temples, places used by the upper classes. Because all of these sites showed burning, archeologists concluded that the whole city was burned. Instead, it is now known that the destruction was centered on major civic structures along the Avenue of the Dead. The sculptures inside palatial structures, such as Xalla, were shattered. No traces of foreign invasion are visible at the site.

Evidence for population decline beginning around the 6th century lends some support to the internal unrest hypothesis. The decline of Teotihuacan has been correlated to lengthy droughts related to the climate changes of 535–536, possibly caused by the eruption of the Ilopango volcano in El Salvador. This theory of ecological decline is supported by archeological remains that show a rise in the percentage of juvenile skeletons with evidence of malnutrition during the 6th century, further supporting the hypothesis of famine as one of the more plausible reasons for the decline of Teotihuacan. Urbanized Teotihuacanos would likely have been dependent on agricultural crops such as maize, beans, amaranth, tomatillos, and pumpkins. If climate change affected crop yields, then the harvest would not have been sufficient to feed Teotihucan&#x27;s extensive population. However, the two main hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. Drought leading to famine could have led to incursions from smaller surrounding civilizations as well as internal unrest.

As Teotihuacan fell in local prominence, other nearby centers, such as Cholula, Xochicalco, and Cacaxtla, competed to fill the power void. They may have even aligned themselves against Teotihuacan to seize the opportunity to further reduce its influence and power. The art and architecture at these sites emulate Teotihuacan forms but also demonstrate an eclectic mix of motifs and iconography from other parts of Mesoamerica, particularly the Maya region.

The sudden destruction of Teotihuacan was common for Mesoamerican city-states of the Classic and Epi-Classic period. Many Maya states suffered similar fates in subsequent centuries, a series of events often referred to as the Classic Maya collapse. Nearby, in the Morelos valley, Xochicalco was sacked and burned in 900, and Tula met a similar fate around 1150.

===Aztec period===
During the 1200s CE, Nahua migrants repopulated the area. By the 1300s, it had fallen under the sway of Huexotla, and in 1409 was assigned its own tlatoani, Huetzin, a son of the tlatoani of Huexotla. But his reign was cut short when Tezozomoc, tlatoani of Azcapotzalco, invaded Huexotla and the neighboring Acolhua lands in 1418. Huetzin was deposed by the invaders, and Tezozomoc installed a man named Totomochtzin. Less than a decade later, in 1427, the Aztec Empire formed, and Teotihuacan was vassalized once more by the Acolhua.

==Culture==
Archeological evidence suggests that Teotihuacan was a multi-ethnic city, and while the predominant language or languages used in Teotihuacan have been lost to history, early forms of Totonac and Nahua, which were spoken by the Aztecs, seem to be highly plausible. This apparent regionally diverse population of Teotihuacan can be traced back to a natural disaster that occurred prior to its population boom. At one point in time, Teotihuacan was rivaled by another basin power, Cuicuilco. Both cities, roughly the same size and hubs for trade, were productive centers of artisans and commerce. Roughly around 100 BCE, however, the power dynamic changed when Mount Xitle, an active volcano, erupted, and heavily affected Cuicuilco and the farmland that supported it. It is believed that the later exponential growth of Teotihuacan&#x27;s population was due to the subsequent migration of those displaced by the eruption. While this eruption is referenced as being the primary cause of the mass exodus, recent advancements of dating have shed light on an even earlier eruption. The eruption of Popocatepetl in the middle of the first century preceded that of Xitle, and is believed to have begun the aforementioned degradation of agricultural lands and structural damage to the city. Xitle&#x27;s eruption further instigated the abandonment of Cuicuilco.

In the Tzacualli phase (–150 CE), Teotihuacan saw a population growth to approximately 60,000 to 80,000 people, most of whom are believed to have come from the Mexican basin. Following this growth, however, the influx of new residents slowed, and evidence suggests that, by the Miccaotli phase, , the urban population had reached its maximum.

In 2001, Terrence Kaufman presented linguistic evidence suggesting that an important ethnic group in Teotihuacan was of Totonacan or Mixe–Zoquean linguistic affiliation. He uses this to explain general influences from Totonacan and Mixe–Zoquean languages in many other Mesoamerican languages, whose people did not have any known history of contact with either of the abovementioned groups. Other scholars maintain that the largest population group must have been of Otomi ethnicity because the Otomi language is known to have been spoken in the area around Teotihuacan both before and after the Classic period and not during the middle period.

Teotihuacan compounds show evidence of being segregated into three classes: high elites, intermediate elites, and the laboring class. Residential architectural structures seem to be differentiable by the artistry and complexity of the structure itself. Based on the quality of construction materials and sizes of rooms as well as the quality of assorted objects found in the residency, dwellings radiating outward from the Central district and along the Avenue of the Dead might have been occupied by higher status individuals. However, Teotihuacan overall does not appear to have been organized into discrete zoning districts. The more elite compounds were often decorated with elaborate murals. Thematic elements of these murals included processions of lavishly dressed priests, jaguar figures, the storm god deity, and an anonymous goddess whose hands offer gifts of maize, precious stones, and water. Rulers who may have requested to be immortalized through art are noticeably absent in Teotihuacan artwork. Observed artwork, instead, tends to portray institutionalized offices and deities. It suggests their art glorifies nature and the supernatural and emphasizes egalitarian rather than aristocratic values. Also absent from Teotihuacan artwork is writing, despite the city having a strong network of contact with the literate Maya.

The laboring classes, themselves also stratified, consisted of farmers, skilled craftworkers, and the peripheral rural population. The city dwelling craftspeople of various specialties were housed in apartment complexes distributed throughout the city, known as neighborhood centers, and evidence shows that these centers were the economic and cultural engines of Teotihuacan. Established by the elite to showcase the sumptuary goods that the resident craftsmen provided, the neighborhood centers representing diversity in goods was aided by the heavy concentration of immigrated individuals from different regions of Mesoamerica. Along with archeological evidence pointing to one of the primary traded items being textiles, craftspeople capitalized on their mastery of painting, building, the performance of music and military training. These neighborhood centers closely resembled individual compounds, often surrounded by physical barriers separating them from the others. In this way, Teotihuacan developed an internal economic competition that fueled productivity and helped create a social structure of its own that differed from the larger structure. The repeated actions of the craftworkers left their physical mark. Based on the wear of teeth, archeologists were able to determine that some bodies worked with fibers with their frontal teeth, insinuating that they were involved with making nets, like those depicted in mural art. Female skeletons provided evidence that they might have sewn or painted for long periods of time, indicative of the headdresses that were created as well as pottery which was fired and painted. Wear on specific joints indicate the carrying of heavy objects over an extended period of time. Evidence of these heavy materials is found in the copious amounts of imported pottery, and raw materials found on-site, such as rhyolitic glass shards, marble, and slate. The residences of the rural population of the city were in enclaves between the middle-class residences or the periphery of the city while smaller encampments filled with earthenware from other regions, also suggest that merchants were situated in their own encampments as well.

===Religion===
In &quot;An Illustrated Dictionary of the Gods and Symbols of Ancient Mexico and the Maya&quot;, Miller and Taube list eight deities:
* The Storm God
* The Great Goddess
* The Feathered Serpent. An important deity in Teotihuacan; most closely associated with the Feathered Serpent Pyramid (Temple of the Feathered Serpent).
* The Old God
* The War Serpent. Taube has differentiated two different serpent deities whose depictions alternate on the Feathered Serpent Pyramid: the Feathered Serpent and what he calls the &quot;War Serpent&quot;. Other researchers are more skeptical.
* The Netted Jaguar
* The Pulque God
* The Fat God. Known primarily from figurines and so assumed to be related to household rituals.

Esther Pasztory adds one more:
* The Flayed God. Known primarily from figurines and so assumed to be related to household rituals.

The consensus among scholars is that the primary deity of Teotihuacan was the Great Goddess of Teotihuacan. The dominant civic architecture is the pyramid. Politics were based on the state religion, and religious leaders were the political leaders. Religious leaders would commission artists to create religious artworks for ceremonies and rituals. The artwork likely commissioned would have been a mural or a censer depicting gods like the Great Goddess of Teotihuacan or the Feathered Serpent. Censers would be lit during religious rituals to invoke the gods including rituals with human sacrifice.

As evidenced from human and animal remains found during excavations of the pyramids in the city, Teotihuacanos practiced human sacrifice. Scholars believe that the people offered human sacrifices as part of a dedication when buildings were expanded or constructed. The victims were probably enemy warriors captured in battle and brought to the city for ritual sacrifice to ensure the city could prosper. Some men were decapitated, some had their hearts removed, others were killed by being hit several times over the head, and some were buried alive. Animals that were considered sacred and represented mythical powers and the military were also buried alive or captured and held in cages such as cougars, a wolf, eagles, a falcon, an owl, and even venomous snakes.

Numerous stone masks have been found at Teotihuacan, and have been generally believed to have been used during a funerary context. However, other scholars call this into question, noting that the masks &quot;do not seem to have come from burials&quot;.

===Population===
Teotihuacan had one of the largest, or perhaps had the largest, population of any city in the Basin of Mexico during its occupation. Teotihuacan was a large pre-historic city that underwent massive population growth and sustained it over most of the city&#x27;s occupancy. In 100 CE, the population could be estimated at around 60,000-80,000, after 200 years of the city&#x27;s occupancy, within of the city. The population, eventually, stabilized around 100,000 people around 300 CE.

The population reached its peak numbers around 400 to 500 CE. During 400 to 500 CE, the Xolalpan period, the city&#x27;s population was estimated to be 100,000 to 200,000 people. This number was achieved by estimating compound sizes to hold approximately 60 to 100, with 2,000 compounds. These high numbers continued until the city started to decline between 600 and 700 CE.

One of Teotihuacan&#x27;s neighborhoods, Teopancazco, was occupied during most of the time Teotihuacan was as well. It showed that Teotihuacan was a multiethnic city that was broken up into areas of different ethnicities and workers. This neighborhood was important in two ways; the high infant mortality rate and the role of the different ethnicities. The high infant mortality rate was important within the neighborhood, and the city at large, as there are a large number of perinatal skeletons at Teopancazco. This suggests that the population of Teotihuacan was sustained and grew due to people coming into the city, rather than the population reproducing. The influx of people came from surrounding areas, bringing different ethnicities to the city.

Teotihuacan also had two other neighborhoods that prominently depicted this multiethnic city picture. Both neighborhoods contained not only different architecture from the other parts of Teotihuacan but also artifacts and burial practices that began the narrative of these places. Archaeologists have also performed oxygen isotope ratio testing and strontium isotope ratio testing to determine, using the bones and the teeth of the skeletons uncovered, whether these skeletons were native to Teotihuacan or were immigrants to the city. The oxygen ratio testing can be used to determine where someone grew up, and the strontium ratio testing can be used to determine where someone was born and where they were living when they died. These tests revealed a lot of information, but specifically enabled clear distinction between the people living in the ethnic neighborhoods and those native to Teotihuacan.

One neighborhood was called Tlailotlacan and was believed to be a neighborhood of migrants predominantly from the Oaxaca region. The excavations there featured prominently artifacts in the Zapotec style of from the Zapotec region, including one tomb with an antechamber. The oxygen isotope ratio testing was particularly helpful when analyzing this neighborhood because it painted a clear picture of the initial influx from Oaxaca, followed by routine journeys back to the homeland to maintain the culture and heritage of the following generations. Later oxygen isotope ratio testing also revealed that out of the skeletons tested, four-fifths of them had immigrated to the city or were born in the city, but spent their childhood in their homeland before returning to Teotihuacan. There was evidence of constant interaction between Teotihuacan and the Oaxacan homeland through journeys taken by children and mothers, keeping the culture and the roots to their homeland alive.

The other main neighborhood was called Barrio de Los Comerciantes, or the Merchants&#x27; Barrio. There is less information about those who lived here (or perhaps more research needs to be done), but this neighborhood also had clear differences from other areas of the city. The architecture was different, featuring round adobe structures, as well as foreign pottery and artifacts identified as belonging to the Gulf Coast region. This neighborhood, similarly to Tlailotclan, saw a huge influx of immigration, determined by the strontium isotope ratio testing of bones and teeth, with people spending a significant part of their lives before death in Teotihuacan.

===Writing and literature===
There was a big find in the La Ventilla district that contains over 30 signs and clusters on the floor of the patio. Much of the findings in Teotihuacan suggest that the inhabitants had their own writing style. The figures were made &quot;quickly and show control&quot; giving the idea that they were practiced and were adequate for the needs of their society. Other societies around Teotihuacan adopted some of the symbols that were used there. The inhabitants there rarely used any other societies&#x27; symbols and art. These writing systems were not anything like those of their neighbors, but the same writings show that they must have been aware of the other writings.

===Obsidian workshops ===

The processing of obsidian was the most developed art and the main source of wealth in Teotihuacan and many other ancient Mesoamerican cultures. The workshops produced tools or objects of obsidian of various uses and types (black and grey colors), intended for commercial transactions beyond the geographical boundaries of the city, with cities such as Monte Alban in Oaxaca Mexico, Tikal in Guatemala, and some Mayan states. Figurines, blades, arrowheads, spikes, knife handles, jewelry, masks, or ornaments, etc were some of the most notable and common objects constructed. Obsidian came mainly from the mines of Pachuca (Teotihuacan) and its processing was the most important industry in the city, which had acquired the monopoly in the trade of obsidian in the broader Middle American region. The state also heavily monitored the trade, movement, and creation of obsidian tools, as it was such an important industry in the city that it was limited to the regional workshops where the tools were produced. This brittle yet strong rock, was mainly formed into objects by flaking off pieces from a larger cone, but wood and bone tools have also been found to have been used in the process.

==Archeological site==
Knowledge of the huge ruins of Teotihuacan was never completely lost. After the fall of the city, various squatters lived on the site. During Aztec times, the city was a place of pilgrimage and identified with the myth of Tollan, the place where the sun was created. Today, Teotihuacan is one of the most noted archeological attractions in Mexico.

===Excavations and investigations===
In the late 17th century Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora (1645–1700) made some excavations around the Pyramid of the Sun. Minor archeological excavations were conducted in the 19th century. In 1905 Mexican archeologist and government official, in the regime of Porfirio Díaz, Leopoldo Batres led a major project of excavation and restoration. The Pyramid of the Sun was restored to celebrate the centennial of the Mexican War of Independence in 1910. The site of Teotihuacan was the first to be expropriated for the national patrimony under the Law of Monuments (1897), giving jurisdiction under legislation for the Mexican state to take control. Some 250 plots were farmed on the site. Peasants who had been farming portions were ordered to leave and the Mexican government eventually paid some compensation to those individuals. A feeder train line was built to the site in 1908, which allowed the efficient hauling of material from the excavations and later brought tourists to the site. In 1910, the International Congress of Americanists met in Mexico, coinciding with the centennial celebrations, and the distinguished delegates, such as its president Eduard Seler and vice president Franz Boas were taken to the newly finished excavations.

Further excavations at the &quot;Ciudadela&quot; were carried out in the 1920s, supervised by Manuel Gamio. Between April 26 and July 29, 1932, Swedish anthropologist/archaeologist Sigvald Linné, his wife, and a small crew excavated in the Xolalpan area, part of the municipality of San Juan Teotihuacán. Other sections of the site were excavated in the 1940s and 1950s. The first site-wide project of restoration and excavation was carried out by INAH from 1960 to 1965, supervised by Jorge Acosta. This undertaking had the goals of clearing the Avenue of the Dead, consolidating the structures facing it, and excavating the Palace of &quot;Quetzalpapalotl&quot;.

During the installation of a &quot;sound and light&quot; show in 1971, workers discovered the entrance to a tunnel and cave system underneath the Pyramid of the Sun. Although scholars long thought this to be a natural cave, more recent examinations have established the tunnel was entirely manmade. The interior of the Pyramid of the Sun has never been fully excavated.

In 1980-82, another major program of excavation and restoration was carried out at the Pyramid of the Feathered Serpent and the Avenue of the Dead complex. Most recently, a series of excavations at the Pyramid of the Moon have greatly expanded evidence of cultural practices.

====Recent discoveries====
In late 2003 a tunnel beneath the Temple of the Feathered Serpent was accidentally discovered by Sergio Gómez Chávez and Julie Gazzola, archeologists of the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH). After days of a heavy rainstorm, Gómez Chávez noticed that a nearly three-foot-wide sinkhole occurred near the foot of the temple pyramid.

First trying to examine the hole with a flashlight from above Gómez could see only darkness, so tied with a line of heavy rope around his waist he was lowered by several colleagues, and descending into the murk he realized it was a perfectly cylindrical shaft. At the bottom he came to rest in an apparently ancient construction – a man-made tunnel, blocked in both directions by immense stones. Gómez was aware that archeologists had previously discovered a narrow tunnel underneath the Pyramid of the Sun and supposed he was now observing a kind of similar mirror tunnel, leading to a subterranean chamber beneath the Temple of the Feathered Serpent. He decided initially to elaborate on a clear hypothesis and to obtain approval. Meanwhile, he erected a tent over the sinkhole to preserve it from the hundreds of thousands of tourists who visit Teotihuacán. Researchers reported that the tunnel was believed to have been sealed in 200 CE.

Preliminary planning of the exploration and fundraising took more than six years.

Before the start of excavations, beginning in the early months of 2004, Victor Manuel Velasco Herrera, from UNAM Institute of Geophysics, determined with the help of ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and a team of some 20 archeologists and workers the approximate length of the tunnel and the presence of internal chambers. They scanned the earth under the Ciudadela, returning every afternoon to upload the results to Gómez&#x27;s computers. By 2005, the digital map was complete. The archeologists explored the tunnel with a remote-controlled robot called Tlaloc II-TC, equipped with an infrared camera and a laser scanner that generates 3D visualization to perform three-dimensional register of the spaces beneath the temple. A small opening in the tunnel wall was made and the scanner captured the first images, 37 meters into the passage.

In 2009, the government granted Gómez permission to dig. By the end of 2009 archeologists of the INAH located the entrance to the tunnel that leads to galleries under the pyramid, where remains of rulers of the ancient city might have been deposited. In August 2010 Gómez Chávez, now director of &quot;Tlalocan Project: Underground Road&quot;, announced that INAH&#x27;s investigation of the tunnel – closed nearly 1,800 years ago by Teotihuacan dwellers – will proceed. The INAH team, consisting of about 30 people supported by national and international advisors at the highest scientific levels, intended to enter the tunnel in September–October 2010. This excavation, the deepest made at the Pre-Hispanic site, was part of the commemorations of the 100th anniversary of archeological excavations at Teotihuacan and its opening to the public.

It was mentioned that the underground passage runs under Feathered Serpent Temple, and the entrance is located a few meters away from the temple at the expected place, deliberately sealed with large boulders nearly 2,000 years ago. The hole that had appeared during the 2003 storms was not the actual entrance; a vertical shaft of almost 5 meters by side is the access to the tunnel. At 14 meters deep, the entrance leads to a nearly 100-meter long corridor that ends in a series of underground galleries in the rock. After archeologists broke ground at the entrance of the tunnel, a staircase, and ladders that would allow easy access to the subterranean site were installed. Works advanced slowly and with painstaking care; excavating was done manually, with spades. Nearly 1,000 tons of soil and debris were removed from the tunnel. There were large spiral seashells, cat bones, pottery, fragments of human skin. The rich array of objects unearthed included: wooden masks covered with inlaid rock jade and quartz, elaborate necklaces, rings, greenstone crocodile teeth and human figurines, crystals shaped into eyes, beetle wings arranged in a box, sculptures of jaguars, and hundreds of metalized spheres. The mysterious globes lay in both the north and south chambers. Ranging from 40 to 130 millimeters, the balls have a core of clay and are covered with a yellow jarosite formed by the oxidation of pyrite. According to George Cowgill of Arizona State University, the spheres are a fascinating find: &quot;Pyrite was certainly used by the Teotihuacanos and other ancient Mesoamerican societies. Originally, the spheres would have shown [sic] brilliantly. They are indeed unique, but I have no idea what they mean.&quot; All these artifacts were deposited deliberately and pointedly, as if in offering to appease the gods.

One of the most remarkable findings in the tunnel chambers was a miniature mountainous landscape, 17 meters underground, with tiny pools of liquid mercury representing lakes. The walls and ceiling of the tunnel were found to have been carefully impregnated with mineral powder composed of magnetite, pyrite (fool&#x27;s gold), and hematite to provide a glittering brightness to the complex, and to create the effect of standing under the stars as a peculiar re-creation of the underworld. At the end of the passage, Gómez Chávez&#x27;s team uncovered four greenstone statues, wearing garments and beads; their open eyes would have shone with precious minerals. Two of the figurines were still in their original positions, leaning back and appearing to contemplate up at the axis where the three planes of the universe meet – likely the founding shamans of Teotihuacan, guiding pilgrims to the sanctuary, and carrying bundles of sacred objects used to perform rituals, including pendants and pyrite mirrors, which were perceived as portals to other realms.

After each new segment was cleared, the 3D scanner documented the progress. By 2015 nearly 75,000 fragments of artifacts have been discovered, studied, cataloged, analyzed and, when possible, restored.

The significance of these new discoveries is publicly explored in a major exhibition at the De Young Museum in San Francisco, which opened in late September 2017.

A recent discovery of an 1800-year-old bouquet of flowers was made in 2021. The flowers, which were found in the tunnel beneath a pyramid dedicated to the feathered serpent deity Quetzalcóatl, date to between roughly 1 and 200 C.E. It is the first time such a well-preserved plant matter has been discovered at Teotihuacan.

====Monuments of Teotihuacan====

The city of Teotihuacan was characterized by large and imposing buildings, which included, apart from the complexes of houses, temples, large squares, stadiums, and palaces of the rulers, nobles, and priests. The city&#x27;s urban-ceremonial space is considered one of the most impressive achievements of the pre-Columbian New World. 
The size and quality of the monuments, the originality of the residential architecture, and the miraculous iconography in the colored murals of the buildings or the vases with the paintings of butterflies, eagles, coyotes with feathers and jaguars, suggest beyond any doubt a high-level civilization, whose cultural influences were spread and transplanted into all the Mesoamerican populations. The main monuments of the city of Teotihuacan are connected to each other by a central road of 45 meters wide and a length of 2 kilometers, called &quot;Avenue of the Dead &quot; (Avenida de Los Muertos), because it is believed to have been paved with tombs. East is the imposing &quot;Pyramid of the Sun &quot; (Piramide del Sol), the third-largest pyramid in the world. It has a volume of 1 million cubic meters. It is a gradual pyramid, with a base dimension of 219.4 x 231.6 meters and a height of 65 meters. At the top of the pyramid, there was a huge pedestal, where human sacrifices were made. 
At the north end of the city, the Boulevard of the dead ends in the &quot;Pyramid of the Moon &quot; (Piramide de la Luna), surrounded laterally by platforms-ramps and lower pyramids. In the southern part is the &quot;Temple of Cetzalkokal &quot; (Quetzalcoatl), dedicated to God in the form of a winged serpent, which gives life and fertility. Sculpture representation of the God Ketzalkokal and twelve Heads of winged snakes adorn the two sides of the uphill scale of the temple.

===Site layout===
The city&#x27;s broad central avenue, called &quot;Avenue of the Dead&quot; (a translation from its Nahuatl name &quot;Miccaotli&quot;), is flanked by impressive ceremonial architecture, including the immense Pyramid of the Sun (third largest in the world after the Great Pyramid of Cholula and the Great Pyramid of Giza). Pyramid of the Moon and The Ciudadela with Temple of the Feathered Serpent are placed at both ends of the Avenue while Palace-museum Quetzalpapálot, the fourth basic structure of the site, is situated between two main pyramids. Along the Avenue are many smaller talud-tablero platforms as well. The Aztecs believed they were tombs, inspiring the name of the avenue. Scholars have now established that these were ceremonial platforms that were topped with temples.

The Avenue of the Dead is roughly 40 meters wide and 4 km long. Further down the Avenue of the Dead, after a small river, is the area known as the Citadel, containing the ruined Temple of the Feathered Serpent Quetzalcoatl. This area was a large plaza surrounded by temples that formed the religious and political center of the city. The name &quot;Citadel&quot; was given to it by the Spanish, who believed it was a fort. Most of the common people lived in large apartment buildings spread across the city. Many of the buildings contained workshops where artisans produced pottery and other goods.

The urban layout of Teotihuacan exhibits two slightly different orientations, which resulted from both astronomical and topographic criteria. The central part of the city, including the Avenue of the Dead, conforms to the orientation of the Sun Pyramid, while the southern part reproduces the orientation of the Ciudadela. The two constructions recorded sunrises and sunsets on particular dates, allowing the use of an observational calendar. The orientation of the Sun Pyramid was intended to record &quot;the sunrises on February 11 and October 29 and sunsets on April 30 and August 13. The interval from February 11 and October 29, as well as from August 13 to April 30, is exactly 260 days&quot;. The recorded intervals are multiples of 13 and 20 days, which were elementary periods of the Mesoamerican calendar. Furthermore, the Sun Pyramid is aligned to Cerro Gordo to the north, which means that it was purposefully built on a spot where a structure with a rectangular ground plan could satisfy both topographic and astronomical requirements. The artificial cave under the pyramid additionally attests to the importance of this spot.

Another example of artificial landscape modifications is the course of the San Juan River, which was modified to bend around the structures as it goes through the center of town eventually returning to its natural course outside of Teotihuacan.
Pecked-cross circles throughout the city and in the surrounding regions served as a way to design the urban grid, and as a way to read their 260-day calendar. The urban grid had great significance to city planners when constructing Teotihuacan, as the cross is pecked into the ground in the Pyramid of the Sun in specific places throughout Teotihuacan in precise degrees and angles over three km in distance. The layout of these crosses suggests it was there to work as a grid to the layout of Teotihuacan because they are laid out in a rectangular shape facing the Avenue of the Dead. The direction of the axes of the crosses don&#x27;t point to an astronomical North and South direction but instead point to their own city&#x27;s North. Numerology also has significance in the cross pecking because of the placement and amount of the holes, which sometimes count to 260 days, the length of the ritual calendrical cycle. Some of the pecked-cross circles also resemble an ancient Aztec game called, patolli.

These pecked-cross circles can be found not just in Teotihuacan, but also throughout Mesoamerica. The ones found all share certain similarities. These include having the shape of two circles, one being inside of the other. They are all found pecked on the ground or onto rocks. They are all created with a small hammer-like device that produces cuplike markings that are 1 centimeter in diameter and 2 centimeters apart. They all have axes that are in line with the city structures of the region. Because they are aligned with the structures of the cities, they also align with the position of significant astronomical bodies.

The Ciudadela was completed during the Miccaotli phase, and the Pyramid of the Sun underwent a complex series of additions and renovations. The Great Compound was constructed across the Avenue of the Dead, west of Ciudadela. This was probably the city&#x27;s marketplace. The existence of a large market in an urban center of this size is strong evidence of state organization. Teotihuacan was at that point simply too large and too complex to have been politically viable as a chiefdom.

The Ciudadela is a great enclosed plaza capable of holding 100,000 people. About 700,000 cubic meters (yards) of material were used to construct its buildings. Its central feature is the Temple of Quetzalcoatl, which was flanked by upper-class apartments. The entire compound was designed to overwhelm visitors.

==Threat from development==
The archeological park of Teotihuacan is under threat from development pressures. In 2004, the governor of Mexico state, Arturo Montiel, gave permission for Wal-Mart to build a large store in the third archeological zone of the park. According to Sergio Gómez Chávez, an archeologist and researcher for Mexico&#x27;s National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) fragments of ancient pottery were found where trucks dumped the soil from the site.

More recently, Teotihuacan has become the center of controversy over Resplandor Teotihuacan, a massive light and sound spectacular installed to create a nighttime show for tourists. Critics explain that a large number of perforations for the project have caused fractures in stones and irreversible damage, while the project will have limited benefit.

In May 2021, the Secretariat of Culture announced that a construction crew had been bulldozing the northern outskirts of the city ruins in order to develop the land for an amusement park, despite three-months worth of orders from the government to stop work. The report detailed that at least 25 archeological structures were in immediate danger.

===Mexican government response===
On May 31, 2021, 250 National Guard troops and 60 agents of the Attorney General&#x27;s Office were sent to the Teotihuacán site to seize parcels of land intended for illegal construction and to forcibly stop further destruction of historical sites. The National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) had suspended authorization for those projects in March, yet construction work with heavy machinery and looting of artifacts had continued. The seizure of the land came a week after the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) warned that Teotihuacán was at risk of losing its UNESCO World Heritage designation.

<doc id="81557" wikidata="Q97276669" url="?curid=81557" title="Government of Senegal">
<text>The Government of Senegal (French: &quot;Gouvernement du Sénégal&quot;) is the union government created by the constitution of Senegal, consisting of the executive, parliament, and judiciary. The Seat of the Government is located in Dakar. The government is led by the president (currently Bassirou Diomaye Faye).

== Executive branch ==

The president is elected by popular vote for a five-year term. The Council of Ministers is appointed by the president. The 2001 constitution introduced a two-term limit for the president; a March 2016 referendum restored the presidential term to five years from seven.

== Legislative branch ==
The National Assembly (&quot;Assemblée Nationale&quot;) comprises 165 members elected for five-year terms by parallel voting. Of these, 90 are elected by plurality vote in single and multi-seat constituencies across Senegal, with a further 15 elected from overseas voters. The remaining 60 elected through proportional representation. The Senate, an indirectly elected upper chamber, was abolished in 2012, leaving a unicameral system.

== Politics ==

Politics in Senegal takes place within the framework of a presidential democratic republic. The president is the head of state and government. Executive power in Senegal is concentrated in the president&#x27;s hands.

== Judicial branch ==
The nation&#x27;s highest courts that deal with business issues are the constitutional council and the Court of Cassation, members of which are named by the president.

== Administrative divisions ==
Senegal is subdivided into 13 regions (&quot;régions&quot;, singular – &quot;région&quot;):

Dakar, Diourbel, Fatick, Kaolack, Kédougou, Kolda, Louga, Matam, Saint-Louis, Sédhiou, Tambacounda, Thiès, Ziguinchor. Local administrators are all appointed by and responsible to the President.

== International relations ==
Senegal joined with the Gambia to form the nominal confederation of Senegambia in 1982. However, the envisaged integration of the two countries was never carried out, and the union was dissolved in 1989. Despite peace talks, a separatist group in the southern Casamance region has sporadically clashed with government forces since 1982. Senegal has a long history of participating in international peacekeeping.

Senegal is a member of ACCT, ACP, AfDB, ECA, ECOWAS, FAO, FZ, G-15, G-77, IAEA, IBRD, ICAO, ICCt, ICC, ICFTU, ICRM, IDA, IDB, IFAD, IFC, IFRCS, ILO, IMF, IMO, Inmarsat, Intelsat, Interpol, IOC, IOM, ITU, MIPONUH, NAM, OAU, OIC, OPCW, PCA, UN, UNCTAD, UNESCO, UNIDO, UNIKOM, UNMIBH, UNMIK, UNTAET, UPU, WADB, WAEMU, WCL, WCO, WFTU, WHO, WIPO, WMO, WToO, and WTrO.

Senegal has acted as a mediator between Sudan and Chad over the crisis in Darfur.

<text>Clematis marmoraria (New Zealand dwarf clematis) is an evergreen plant with parsley-like, leathery and dark green foliage. The white flowers are about 2 cm wide, blooming in early spring.

==Habitat==
This clematis can be found growing in alpine marble karrenfeld either in crevices in massive marble, or amongst semi-fixed rocks, stones, and similar rocky sites in open herbfield. 

==Uses==
&quot;Clematis × cartmanii&quot; is a hybrid between &quot;Clematis marmoraria&quot; and &quot;Clematis paniculata&quot; that is grown ornamentally. The hybrid was created by NZ horticulturalist Joe Cartman and several popular cultivars of the cross are now in cultivation.

<doc id="81560" wikidata="Q899731" url="?curid=81560" title="Zeros and poles">
<text>In complex analysis (a branch of mathematics), a pole is a certain type of singularity of a complex-valued function of a complex variable. It is the simplest type of non-removable singularity of such a function (see essential singularity). Technically, a point is a pole of a function if it is a zero of the function and is holomorphic (i.e. complex differentiable) in some neighbourhood of .

A function is meromorphic in an open set if for every point of there is a neighborhood of in which at least one of and is holomorphic.

If is meromorphic in , then a zero of is a pole of , and a pole of is a zero of . This induces a duality between &quot;zeros&quot; and &quot;poles&quot;, that is fundamental for the study of meromorphic functions. For example, if a function is meromorphic on the whole complex plane plus the point at infinity, then the sum of the multiplicities of its poles equals the sum of the multiplicities of its zeros.

== Definitions ==
A function of a complex variable is holomorphic in an open domain if it is differentiable with respect to at every point of . Equivalently, it is holomorphic if it is analytic, that is, if its Taylor series exists at every point of , and converges to the function in some neighbourhood of the point. A function is meromorphic in if every point of has a neighbourhood such that at least one of and is holomorphic in it.

A zero of a meromorphic function is a complex number such that . A pole of is a zero of .

If is a function that is meromorphic in a neighbourhood of a point formula_1 of the complex plane, then there exists an integer such that 
:formula_2
is holomorphic and nonzero in a neighbourhood of formula_1 (this is a consequence of the analytic property).
If , then formula_1 is a &quot;pole&quot; of order (or multiplicity) of . If , then formula_1 is a zero of order formula_6 of . &quot;Simple zero&quot; and &quot;simple pole&quot; are terms used for zeroes and poles of order formula_7 &quot;Degree&quot; is sometimes used synonymously to order.

This characterization of zeros and poles implies that zeros and poles are isolated, that is, every zero or pole has a neighbourhood that does not contain any other zero and pole.

Because of the &quot;order&quot; of zeros and poles being defined as a non-negative number and the symmetry between them, it is often useful to consider a pole of order as a zero of order and a zero of order as a pole of order . In this case a point that is neither a pole nor a zero is viewed as a pole (or zero) of order 0.

A meromorphic function may have infinitely many zeros and poles. This is the case for the gamma function (see the image in the infobox), which is meromorphic in the whole complex plane, and has a simple pole at every non-positive integer. The Riemann zeta function is also meromorphic in the whole complex plane, with a single pole of order 1 at . Its zeros in the left halfplane are all the negative even integers, and the Riemann hypothesis is the conjecture that all other zeros are along .

In a neighbourhood of a point formula_8 a nonzero meromorphic function is the sum of a Laurent series with at most finite &quot;principal part&quot; (the terms with negative index values):
:formula_9
where is an integer, and formula_10 Again, if (the sum starts with formula_11, the principal part has terms), one has a pole of order , and if (the sum starts with formula_12, there is no principal part), one has a zero of order formula_6.

==At infinity==
A function formula_14 is &quot;meromorphic at infinity&quot; if it is meromorphic in some neighbourhood of infinity (that is outside some disk), and there is an integer such that 
:formula_15
exists and is a nonzero complex number.

In this case, the point at infinity is a pole of order if , and a zero of order formula_6 if .

For example, a polynomial of degree has a pole of degree at infinity.

The complex plane extended by a point at infinity is called the Riemann sphere.

If is a function that is meromorphic on the whole Riemann sphere, then it has a finite number of zeros and poles, and the sum of the orders of its poles equals the sum of the orders of its zeros. 

Every rational function is meromorphic on the whole Riemann sphere, and, in this case, the sum of orders of the zeros or of the poles is the maximum of the degrees of the numerator and the denominator.

== Examples ==
* The function
::formula_17
: is meromorphic on the whole Riemann sphere. It has a pole of order 1 or simple pole at formula_18 and a simple zero at infinity.

* The function
:: formula_19
: is meromorphic on the whole Riemann sphere. It has a pole of order 2 at formula_20 and a pole of order 3 at formula_21. It has a simple zero at formula_22 and a quadruple zero at infinity.

* The function
:: formula_23
: is meromorphic in the whole complex plane, but not at infinity. It has poles of order 1 at formula_24. This can be seen by writing the Taylor series of formula_25 around the origin.

* The function
::formula_26
: has a single pole at infinity of order 1, and a single zero at the origin.

All above examples except for the third are rational functions. For a general discussion of zeros and poles of such functions, see .

==Function on a curve==

The concept of zeros and poles extends naturally to functions on a &quot;complex curve&quot;, that is complex analytic manifold of dimension one (over the complex numbers). The simplest examples of such curves are the complex plane and the Riemann surface. This extension is done by transferring structures and properties through charts, which are analytic isomorphisms.

More precisely, let be a function from a complex curve to the complex numbers. This function is holomorphic (resp. meromorphic) in a neighbourhood of a point of if there is a chart formula_27 such that formula_28 is holomorphic (resp. meromorphic) in a neighbourhood of formula_29 Then, is a pole or a zero of order if the same is true for formula_29

If the curve is compact, and the function is meromorphic on the whole curve, then the number of zeros and poles is finite, and the sum of the orders of the poles equals the sum of the orders of the zeros. This is one of the basic facts that are involved in Riemann–Roch theorem.

<doc id="81562" wikidata="Q603000" url="?curid=81562" title="John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band">
<text>John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band is the debut solo studio album by English musician John Lennon. Backed by the Plastic Ono Band, it was released by Apple Records on 11 December 1970 in tandem with the similarly titled album by his wife, Yoko Ono. At the time of its issue, &quot;John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band&quot; received mixed reviews overall, but later came to be widely regarded as Lennon&#x27;s best solo album.

Co-produced by Lennon, Ono and Phil Spector, it followed Lennon&#x27;s recording of three experimental releases with Ono and a live album from the 1969 version of the Plastic Ono Band. &quot;John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band&quot; contains a largely raw production sound with songs heavily influenced by Lennon&#x27;s recent primal therapy. Its lyrics reflect Lennon&#x27;s personal issues and includes themes of child-parent abandonment and psychological suffering. The tracks were recorded in September and October 1970 at Abbey Road Studios in London, simultaneously with Ono&#x27;s similarly titled solo album.

&quot;John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band&quot; peaked at number eight on the UK Albums Chart and number six on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. In 1987, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it fourth in its list &quot;The 100 Best Albums of the Last Twenty Years&quot; and in 2012, ranked it number 23 in their list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. It was voted number 244 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000). In 2000, the album was remixed with two bonus tracks, &quot;Power to the People&quot; and &quot;Do the Oz&quot;. The album&#x27;s 2021 &quot;Ultimate Mixes&quot; reissue, in the eight-disc &quot;Ultimate Collection&quot; box set, features 159 previously unreleased mixes, demos, outtakes, and isolated track elements.

==Background==

Following the break-up of the Beatles in April 1970, John Lennon and his wife Yoko Ono undertook primal therapy with the guidance of Arthur Janov for four weeks at his London offices. The three then flew to Los Angeles to continue the therapy for four months. Janov&#x27;s therapy technique emphasised emotionally reliving repressed childhood traumas rather than analytical discussion.

Lennon and Ono stayed in a rented house in Bel Air, keeping a low profile and committing fully to Janov&#x27;s course. Lennon embraced the discipline as he had Transcendental Meditation in the late 1960s, and the act of engaging with past traumas became &quot;too primal&quot;. Ono later commented that primal therapy helped curb his possessiveness towards her, as he recognised that his feelings of jealousy stemmed from events that took place long before they met.

With the experience he received from the therapy, Lennon was able to channel his emotions into an album&#x27;s worth of self-revelatory material. In July, he started to record demos of songs that would show up on &quot;John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band&quot;. On 26 July, he taped numerous demos of &quot;God&quot;, which includes the line &quot;I don&#x27;t believe in Beatles&quot;. &quot;When a Boy Meets a Girl&quot; was among the songs Lennon demoed at this time, but he did not record it for the album.

Lennon&#x27;s therapy was never completed due to the expiry of his US visa. Janov had intended that Lennon&#x27;s treatment would require a minimum of a year, such was the severity of his trauma. Janov expressed concern that the therapy had ended prematurely and that Lennon&#x27;s rediscovered anger over his childhood remained unresolved.

==Music and lyrics==
Lennon&#x27;s experience in primal therapy strongly influenced both the lyrical content of the album, pushing him toward themes of child–parent relationships and psychological suffering, and the simple yet intense style of the album&#x27;s music. Throughout the album Lennon touches on many personal issues: his abandonment by his parents, in &quot;Mother&quot; (though he denied that that was what the song was about on a posthumously-released live album); the means by which young people are made into soldiers, in &quot;Working Class Hero&quot;; a reminder that, despite his rage and pain, Lennon still embraces &quot;Love&quot;; and &quot;God&quot;, a renunciation of external saviours. In the piano-driven climax of &quot;God&quot;, after listing a handful of things he does not believe in, including Jesus, Hitler, Buddha, Elvis, &quot;Zimmerman&quot; (Bob Dylan) and Beatles, Lennon proclaims that he believes only in himself and Ono.

&quot;Look at Me&quot; dates from the period of the White Album (1968), and is built on a fingerpicking guitar pattern very similar to the one Lennon used in &quot;Dear Prudence&quot;, &quot;Happiness Is a Warm Gun&quot; and &quot;Julia&quot;. Donovan claimed that he taught Lennon this technique while the two were in Rishikesh in 1968. &quot;Remember&quot; uses the same piano riff that Lennon played in the discarded coda to the Beatles&#x27; July 1969 recording of &quot;Something&quot;.

&quot;My Mummy&#x27;s Dead&quot;, which closes &quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot;, is partly set to the tune of the nursery rhyme &quot;Three Blind Mice&quot;. The recording used on the album was taken from Lennon&#x27;s Los Angeles demos.

==Recording==
Having exhausted the extensions of their American visas, Lennon and Ono returned from the US on 15 September 1970. Soon afterwards, Ono miscarried at close to eight months pregnant, and Lennon&#x27;s equilibrium was tested when his father, Alf Lennon, resumed contact, having recently remarried and become a father again. At Alf&#x27;s request, they met up at Tittenhurst Park for Lennon&#x27;s 30th birthday, but Lennon launched into a primal therapy-inspired tirade against him and, according to the account Alf left with his solicitor, threatened to kill him.

Recording for the album took place at Abbey Road Studios in London, beginning on 26 September. Lennon played guitar or piano on the songs, with bassist Klaus Voormann and drummer Ringo Starr as the other core musicians. The album title refers to the Plastic Ono Band, the conceptual band Lennon and Ono formed in 1969 of various supporting musicians they would use on their various solo albums. Lennon asked Phil Spector, who had produced Lennon&#x27;s hit &quot;Instant Karma!&quot; earlier that year, to co-produce the new album. Since they were unable to contact Spector before recording began, Allen Klein, Lennon&#x27;s manager, took out an advertisement in &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine that read: &quot;Phil! John is ready this weekend.&quot;

Spector and Apple artist Billy Preston each played piano on a track. During the sessions, Lennon, Voormann and Starr jammed on a variety of songs in between recording the new tracks: &quot;When a Boy Meets a Girl&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s All Right Mama&quot;, &quot;Glad All Over&quot;, &quot;Honey Don&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot;, &quot;Hound Dog&quot; and &quot;Matchbox&quot;. They also taped the basic track for Starr&#x27;s &quot;Early 1970&quot; in which the drummer describes his relationship with each of his former bandmates; in the verse dedicated to Lennon, Starr sings, &quot;They screamed and they cried, now they&#x27;re free&quot;.

As longstanding friends of Lennon, Voormann and Starr were disturbed by his emotional behaviour in the studio. In his 2004 book &quot;Postcards from the Boys&quot;, Starr recalls that Lennon would burst out crying or start screaming midway through recording a track. Voormann said that Lennon would change from being upbeat to highly emotional and would discuss his feelings with Ono as they listened to playbacks in the studio control room. In Voormann&#x27;s view, the effects of Lennon&#x27;s therapy were especially confronting to Starr, since &quot;The old John was gone; it was a different John. It wasn&#x27;t the one he was used to.&quot;

According to music critic Richie Unterberger, bootlegs from the sessions suggest that Lennon was far from the despondent artist reflected in the finished album. As the ensemble recorded &quot;Remember&quot; on 9 October, Lennon&#x27;s 30th birthday, George Harrison visited the studio and delivered a tape of &quot;It&#x27;s Johnny&#x27;s Birthday&quot;, after Ono had asked Lennon&#x27;s friends for musical greetings to mark the occasion. The session tapes reveal Lennon and Starr&#x27;s delight at Harrison&#x27;s arrival. In author Robert Rodriguez&#x27;s description, the meeting reflects the three former Beatles&#x27; closeness, at the expense of Paul McCartney, as well as Lennon&#x27;s playfulness while making &quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot;.

Lennon and Ono produced &quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot; largely on their own, as Spector was absent for much of the recording sessions. Spector mixed the album for three days towards the end of October. All work on the record was completed by 27 October, when Lennon and Ono flew to New York to publicise primal therapy and collaborate on the experimental films &quot;Up Your Legs Forever&quot; and &quot;Fly&quot;.

==Artwork==
Lennon&#x27;s album cover is almost identical to Ono&#x27;s companion piece, the sole difference being that on Ono&#x27;s cover, she is lying on Lennon&#x27;s body. The photo was taken at Lennon&#x27;s Tittenhurst Park estate with a consumer-grade Instamatic camera by actor Dan Richter, who also worked as an assistant for the Lennons at the time. The initial compact disc issue of the album listed the title and artist, while the 2000 remixed version restores the original artwork. In addition, the original LP had no track listing on the back cover, which instead showed a school photo of Lennon in his youth.

The LP included a lyric sheet on one side of its inner sleeve. Despite Capitol Records&#x27; concerns over Lennon&#x27;s profanities in &quot;I Found Out&quot; and &quot;Working Class Hero&quot;, the lyrics appeared uncensored in the US album package. In the UK, EMI ensured that each mention of &quot;fucking&quot; in &quot;Working Class Hero&quot; was bowdlerised through the use of asterisks.

==Release==
&quot;John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band&quot; was released in both the UK and US on 11 December 1970, the same day as Ono&#x27;s matching album. Lennon considered issuing &quot;Love&quot; as a single in the US but settled on &quot;Mother&quot;. The song was edited down to under four minutes through the removal of the opening funeral bells and an early fadeout. Backed by Ono&#x27;s track &quot;Why&quot;, the single was released there on 28 December. In Japan, the album&#x27;s title was , which translates as &quot;John&#x27;s Soul&quot;. Several US radio stations banned &quot;Working Class Hero&quot; because of the song&#x27;s use of the word &quot;fucking&quot;.
Lennon viewed &quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot; as his best work up to that point. He called it &quot;Sgt. Lennon&quot;, referring to the Beatles&#x27; 1967 album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. His promotion for the album included a lengthy interview with Jann Wenner of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, recorded in New York on 8 December and published in two installments under the title &quot;Lennon Remembers&quot;. As with his new music, Lennon&#x27;s comments reflected the effects of primal therapy. He used the opportunity to discuss his troubled childhood, debunk the Beatles as a myth, and denigrate his former bandmates&#x27; solo albums. He also dismissed the effectiveness of the 1960s cultural revolution as a &quot;dream&quot; and committed to political protest as his new artistic direction. Together with the sentiments of &quot;God&quot;, the interview ended any hope of the Beatles reuniting and was followed soon after by McCartney filing suit in a London court to dissolve the group as a legal partnership.

The album and Lennon&#x27;s political stance furthered his credibility among underground radicals, as the New Left welcomed his debunking of the Beatles&#x27; image. Its commercial performance nevertheless paled beside Harrison&#x27;s concurrently released &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; and McCartney&#x27;s self-titled solo album, issued in April. &quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot; peaked at number 8 in the UK and number 6 in the US, spending eighteen weeks in the top 100. In the Netherlands, it was number 1 for seven weeks.

Lennon was especially aggrieved that his LP was overshadowed by the acclaim afforded &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;. According to ABKCO executive Allan Steckler, neither Klein nor promotions man Pete Bennett knew how to go about marketing &quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot; in the US, where it received minimal AM airplay. Starr attributed the muted public response to the album&#x27;s paucity of &quot;toe-tappers&quot;.

==Contemporary critical reception==
Although &quot;John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band&quot; received some highly favourable reviews, critical reception to the album was mixed overall. Andy Gray of the &quot;NME&quot; said it offered truths that would resonate with most listeners but that Lennon was governed by &quot;a great big chip on his shoulder about class consciousness and the unfairness of the world&quot;. Gray also wrote: &quot;I have rarely heard so much anguish and suffering put into a track as in the first song, &#x27;Mother&#x27;.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Geoffrey Cannon wrote that Lennon had taken the self-centredness of &quot;McCartney&quot; to an obsessive level. He predicted that the songs would have limited interest but added: &quot;Lennon&#x27;s album makes a deep impression, if more on him than us. He screams and cries, desolation, bitterness, anguish. This is the album of a man of black bile. This is declamation, not music.&quot; Writing in &quot;The Times&quot;, Richard Williams described &quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot; as &quot;almost unbearably stark&quot; and &quot;not an album I can put on for pleasure&quot;.

Reviewing for &quot;Creem&quot;, Dave Marsh found it &quot;totally enthralling to see that Lennon has once again unified, to some degree, his life and his music into a truly whole statement&quot;. He deemed Lennon&#x27;s perspective &quot;elitist&quot; and less adventurous than Ono&#x27;s on her LP, but nevertheless likened the album to the highly political statements made by jazz artists such as Archie Shepp, Charlie Parker and Charles Mingus in their music. Michael Ross, also of &quot;Creem&quot;, wrote in the December 1970 issue &quot;This record is John, the man, destroying the dream, the idol, the idols, revitalizing his dirt-poor emotions, feeling that in the midst of change, he is, love is.&quot; Don Heckman of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was unimpressed by &quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot;, calling it a &quot;group of empty selections&quot; that, like McCartney&#x27;s album, showed its creator to be overly preoccupied with himself and weakened artistically as a solo performer. &quot;Billboard&quot;″s reviewer described the album as &quot;Self determination music, intensely analytical of self with production values kept down to the minimum&quot;, and predicted it would remain the subject of analysis for years like &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;.

John Gabree of &quot;High Fidelity&quot; deemed the LP &quot;a tremendously exciting listening experience, perhaps the best any Beatle has ever offered&quot;. He praised the musicianship, sparse arrangements and Lennon&#x27;s directness, and said that on the strength of &quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot; and Harrison&#x27;s &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, he was not bothered if the Beatles ever reunited as a band. Robert Christgau named &quot;John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band&quot; the best album of 1970 in his year-end list for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, and in a decade-end list, he ranked it 21st best from the 1970s.

==Retrospective assessments and legacy==

&quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot; is considered by some to be Lennon&#x27;s best solo album and is certainly one of his most influential works. The record became known as &quot;the Primal Album&quot;. Janov incorporated it into his therapy course, although he rued that Lennon had cut off his therapy prematurely and that &quot;We had opened him up, and we didn&#x27;t have time to put him back together again.&quot;

Music critic Greil Marcus remarked, &quot;John&#x27;s singing in the last verse of &#x27;God&#x27; may be the finest in all of rock.&quot; In a retrospective review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Robert Christgau wrote that the album&#x27;s lyrics are political, existential, and carefully thought out, while Spector&#x27;s production is elegantly simple so that each instrument resonates. Christgau added: &quot;Left out in the open, without protective harmonies or racket, Lennon&#x27;s singing takes on an expressive specificity that anyone in search of the century&#x27;s great vocal performances would be foolish to overlook.&quot; Garry Mulholland of &quot;Uncut&quot; describes it as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; that &quot;remains the most profound and perfectly realised confessional album that rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll has produced&quot;.

&quot;Mojo&quot; critic John Harris includes &quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot; among &quot;the trilogy of truly essential post-Beatles solo albums&quot;, along with &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; and Wings&#x27; &quot;Band on the Run&quot;. In 2008, it was the subject of a documentary film by Matthew Longfellow as part of Eagle Rock&#x27;s &quot;Classic Albums&quot; series. Coinciding with the 50th anniversary of Lennon and Ono&#x27;s twin 1970 albums, Thames &amp; Hudson published the book &quot;John &amp; Yoko/Plastic Ono Band&quot;, which includes illustrations by Voormann.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moran/SMH&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, &quot;Q&quot; placed &quot;John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band&quot; at number 62 in its list of the &quot;100 Greatest British Albums Ever&quot;. In 1987, the album was ranked fourth on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 100 best albums of the period 1967–87, and in 2003, it was placed at number 22 in the magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, 23 in a 2012 revised list, and 85 in a 2020 revised list. In 2006, the album was placed by &quot;Pitchfork&quot; at number 60 of its Top 100 Albums of the 1970s. In 2006, the album was chosen by &quot;Time&quot; as one of the 100 best albums of all time.

==Subsequent releases==
After Lennon&#x27;s death, EMI&#x27;s Parlophone label reissued &quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot;, along with seven other Lennon albums, as part of a box set, which was released in the UK on 15 June 1981. In 2000, Ono supervised a remixing of &quot;John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band&quot; for its remastered CD reissue, including two bonus tracks: Lennon&#x27;s 1971 hit &quot;Power to the People&quot;, and &quot;Do the Oz&quot;, originally released as the B-side to &quot;God Save Us&quot; under the name Elastic Oz Band and later part of the 1998 box set &quot;John Lennon Anthology&quot;.

In 2003, Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab reissued the album in 24-karat Gold CD audio and 180-gram half-speed mastered GAIN 2 Ultra Analog in vinyl reissues. In 2010, a digital remaster of Lennon&#x27;s entire discography was released, using original mixes and artwork.

A 50th Anniversary reissue of the album was released on 23 April 2021, under the title &quot;John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band: The Ultimate Collection&quot;. The eight-disc box set spreads over six CDs and two Blu-ray HD discs, and features 159 new mixes, including previously unreleased demos, studio outtakes, and isolated track elements, along with 5.1 surround and Dolby Atmos mixes.

<text>The White Sea (; Karelian and ; ) is a southern inlet of the Barents Sea located on the northwest coast of Russia. It is surrounded by Karelia to the west, the Kola Peninsula to the north, and the Kanin Peninsula to the northeast. The whole of the White Sea is under Russian sovereignty and considered to be part of the internal waters of Russia. Administratively, it is divided between the Arkhangelsk and Murmansk oblasts and the Republic of Karelia.

The major port of Arkhangelsk is located on the White Sea. For much of Russia&#x27;s history this was Russia&#x27;s main centre of international maritime trade, conducted by the Pomors (&quot;seaside settlers&quot;) from Kholmogory. In the modern era it became an important Soviet naval and submarine base. The White Sea–Baltic Canal connects the White Sea with the Baltic Sea.

The White Sea is one of the four seas named (not only in English) after common colour terms—the others being the Black, Red and Yellow seas.

==Geography==
===Extent===
The International Hydrographic Organization defines the northern limit of the White Sea as &quot;A line joining Svyatoy Nos (Murmansk Coast, 39°47&#x27;E) and Cape Kanin&quot;.

===Topography===

There are four main bays or gulfs on the White Sea. These bays connect with the funnel-shaped opening to the Barents Sea via a narrow strait called &quot;Gorlo&quot; (, meaning &quot;throat&quot;). Kandalaksha Gulf lies in the western part of the White Sea; it is the deepest part of the sea, reaching 340 metres (1,115 feet). On the south, Onega Bay receives the Onega River. To the southeast, the Dvina Bay receives the Northern Dvina at the major port of Arkhangelsk. On the east side of the &#x27;gorlo&#x27;, opposite to the Kola Peninsula, is Mezen Bay. It receives the Mezen River and the Kuloy River. Other major rivers flowing into the sea are the Vyg, Niva, Umba, Varzuga and Ponoy.

The seabed of the central part and Dvina Bay is covered in silt and sand, whereas the bottom of the northern part, the Kandalaksha Gulf and Onega Bay is a mixture of sand and stones. Ice age deposits often emerge near the sea shores. Northwestern coasts are tall and rocky but the slope is much weaker at the southeastern side.

The White Sea contains a large number of islands, but most of them are small. The main island group is the Solovetsky Islands, located almost in the middle of the sea, near the entrance to Onega Bay. Kiy Island in Onega Bay is significant due to a historic monastery. Velikiy Island, located close to the shore, is the largest island in the Kandalaksha Gulf.

===Hydrography and bathymetry===
The White Sea is a water-filled depression in the block of a continental shelf known as the Baltic Shield. Its bottom is very uneven and contains the Kandalaksha Hollow in the northwest and the Solovetsky Islands in the south. Also, the Onega Bay has many small underwater elevations. The opening and the &quot;gorlo&quot; of the sea are rather shallow, with depths about 50 metres or less. There is an underwater ridge in the northern part of the &quot;gorlo&quot;, resulting in maximum depths of 40 metres in that part. This hinders water exchange between the White and Barents seas. The exchange is assisted by the tides, which are semidiurnal (rising twice a day), with the amplitude increasing from 1 metre on the south to 10 metres in Mezen Bay. Currents are rather weak in the open seas with the speed below 1 km/h, but they significantly strengthen in the bays. The tidal waves are much faster than the regular currents and reach the speeds of 9 km/h in Mezen Bay, 3.6 km/h in Onega Bay and 1.3 km/h in the Kandalaksha Gulf.

Rivers bring annually about 215 km3 of fresh water, on average, mostly to the Onega, Mezen and Dvina bays. The Northern Dvina alone may contribute up to 171 km3 in some years, with the Mezen, Onega, Kem and Vyg rivers adding up to 38.5, 27.0, 12.5 and 11.5 km3, respectively. About 40% of this volume is brought during the snow melting in May, and the inflow is minimal in February–March. This inflow raises and lowers the sea level that promotes the water exchange with the Barents Sea. As a result, annually, about 2,000 km3 and 2,200 km3 flow in and out of the White Sea, respectively. The inflow of fresh water in spring decreases the surface salinity in the top 5–10-metre layer to 23‰ (parts per thousand) in the eastern and 26–27‰ in the western parts of the sea, reaching 10–12‰ in Dvina Bay; it also increases the content of silicon and silicates in water, which is a characteristic feature of the White Sea.

Storms are the strongest in October–November. Shallow sea depths reduce the wave height to the average of 1 metre, sometimes reaching 3–5 metres. The sea is quiet in July–August.

===Climate===

The climate varies between polar and subarctic with frequent fogs and clouds. Winds are predominantly southwestern in winter with speeds of 4–8 m/s. They bring cold air from the south, establishing the temperature of about −15 °C (February) over most of the sea. The northern part is warmer at about −9 °C, sometimes reaching −6 °C, due to the warm air masses from the Atlantic. Arctic anticyclones, however, change winds to the northeastern ones, bringing much colder weather with temperatures of about −25 °C. Summers are cold, cloudy and relatively humid, with northeastern winds and frequent rains. Average July temperatures are 8–10 °C. Occasional southeastern winds bring warm air from Europe, raising the temperature to 17–19 °C and sometimes even to 30 °C. Annual precipitations increase from 282 mm in the north 529 in the south.

In winter, from October–November to April–May, the sea freezes, with the average January water temperatures of −1.9 °C in the north, between −1.3 and −1.7 °С in the centre, and between −0.5 and −0.7 °С in the bays. These variations are due to the distribution of water salinity across the sea, which increases from 24 to 26‰ in the centre to 30.5‰ in the &quot;gorlo&quot;, reaching 34.0–34.5‰ toward the Barents Sea. The freezing period varies from year to year as shown in the satellite image to the right. The ice is not stationary, but 90% of it is floating and is continuously removed to the Barents Sea. Ice thickness is usually about 40 cm but may reach 150 cm in cold winters.

In summer, surface water warms up to 15 °С in the central part, but remains relatively cold in the north, at 7–8 °С, due to the water exchange between the surface and the cold bottom part which is enhanced by the shallow depths in the northern parts. Deep sea (about 100 m or more) is characterised by stable temperature (−1.4 °С) and salinity (30‰). The depth distribution of water temperature is very inhomogeneous across the sea. For example, at the exit from Dvina Bay, water temperature drops to 0 °C at the depth of only 12–15 m, but the same temperature is reached at 65 m at the exit from the Kandalaksha Gulf.

==History==
Residents of Novgorod knew of the White Sea from at least the 11th century and rapidly explored its commercial significance for navigation and its coastal forests rich in fur animals. One of the earliest settlements near the sea shores grew up in the late 14th century at Kholmogory, on the Northern Dvina. From there, in 1492, a merchant fleet laden with grain and carrying ambassadors of Ivan III of Russia sailed to Denmark, marking the establishment of the first international seaport in Russia.

The first foreign ship to arrive in Kholmogory was the English &quot;Edward Bonaventure&quot; commanded by Richard Chancellor in 1553. Together with two other ships under the command of Hugh Willoughby, his crew had sought a northern route to the Indies, especially India and China. The expedition, sponsored by King Edward VI of England and a group of about 240 English merchants, had London&#x27;s authorisation to establish trade connections. The ships of Willoughby were separated and the other two were lost at sea, but &quot;Edward Bonaventure&quot; managed to pass the White Sea and reach Kholmogory, from where Chancellor was escorted to Moscow to meet the Russian Tsar, Ivan IV. Returning from Russia in 1554, Chancellor brought back a detailed description of Moscow and the Russian north, which were largely unknown to Europe, as well as a letter from the Tsar expressing desire to establish trade relations with England. In 1555 Queen Mary issued a charter authorising the Muscovy Company to trade with Russia via the White Sea route.

Dutch ships soon followed the English, and the port of Kholmogory became busy with shipments of fur and fish. Local and foreign shops and factories were established in the city at that time. The port was reinforced with a fortress which sustained a siege by the Polish-Lithuanian army in 1613. Increasing traffic overloaded the port, which relied on shallow river-waters and had limited ship-capacity. However, instead of expanding the old port, Ivan IV established a new one down-river in 1584, called New Kholmogory, which from 1596 began to become known as Arkhangelsk.

Between the 15th and early 18th centuries, the White Sea served as the major trade route in and out of Russia. This role decreased later after the foundation of Saint Petersburg (1703), which opened a more direct ice-free connection between Russia and the bulk of Western Europe via the Baltic Sea. From the 1920s, most northern Russian sea shipments diverted from the White Sea to the new port of Murmansk (officially founded in 1916), where the waters did not freeze in winter.

== Legislative status ==

The entire water area of the White Sea is the territorial waters of the Russian Federation. Any movement of foreign vessels on the White Sea is carried out in accordance with the legislation of the Russian Federation.

==Fauna and economy==

The sea hosts more than 700 species of invertebrates, about 60 species of fish, and five species of marine mammals, including the friendly beluga and the white whale. Several other dolphin species, such as harbour porpoises, appear less frequently while larger whales such as bowhead, humpback and rorquals, northern bottlenose, orcas have been considered as rare visitors to the waters while actual frequency of occurrences within White Sea basin is not specified. The fishing industry is relatively small, mostly targeting harp seal, ringed seal, herring, saffron cod, European smelt, Atlantic cod and Atlantic salmon. There is a developing seaweed industry.

The White Sea is an important traffic centre of northwestern Russia, interconnecting various economic regions and providing an outlet to the foreign routes. The White Sea–Baltic Canal links it through Lake Onega to the Baltic Sea and the major city and port of Saint Petersburg. The Baltic Sea, in turn, is connected by the Volga–Baltic Waterway to the Volga River, Black, Caspian, and Azov seas. The major ports on the White Sea are Arkhangelsk, Belomorsk, Onega, Mezen, Kem, Kandalaksha and Umba. Despite being frozen in winter, the sea remains navigable all year around because of deployment of icebreakers.

<text>Astrid Kirchherr (; 20 May 1938 – 12 May 2020) was a German photographer and artist known for her association with the Beatles (along with her friends Klaus Voormann and Jürgen Vollmer) and her photographs of the band&#x27;s original members — John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Stuart Sutcliffe and Pete Best — during their early days in Hamburg.

Kirchherr met artist Stuart Sutcliffe in the Kaiserkeller bar in Hamburg in 1960, where Sutcliffe was playing bass with the Beatles, and was later engaged to him, before his death in 1962. Although Kirchherr shot very few photographs after 1967, her early work has been exhibited in Hamburg, Bremen, London, Liverpool, New York City, Washington, D.C., Tokyo, Vienna, and at the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Hall of Fame. She published three limited-edition books of photographs.

==Early life==

Kirchherr was born on 20 May 1938 in Hamburg, Germany, and was the daughter of a former executive of the German branch of the Ford Motor Company 
and was brought up by her widowed mother, Nielsa Kirchherr, on Eimsbütteler Strasse, in a wealthy part of the Hamburg suburb of Altona.
During World War II, she was evacuated to the safety of the Baltic Sea where she remembered seeing dead bodies on the shore (after the ships &quot;Cap Arcona&quot; and the SS &quot;Deutschland&quot; had been bombed and sunk) and the destruction in Hamburg when she returned.

After her graduation, Kirchherr enrolled in the Meisterschule für Mode, Textil, Grafik und Werbung in Hamburg, as she wanted to study fashion design but demonstrated a talent for black-and-white photography. Reinhard Wolf, the school&#x27;s main photographic tutor, convinced her to switch courses and promised that he would hire her as his assistant when she graduated. Kirchherr worked for Wolf as his assistant from 1959 until 1963.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Kirchherr and her art school friends were involved in the European existentialist movement whose followers were later nicknamed &quot;Exis&quot; by Lennon. In 1995, she told BBC Radio Merseyside: &quot;Our philosophy then, because we were only little kids, was wearing black clothes and going around looking moody. Of course, we had a clue who Jean-Paul Sartre was. We got inspired by all the French artists and writers, because that was the closest we could get. England was so far away, and America was out of the question. So France was the nearest. So we got all the information from France, and we tried to dress like the French existentialists... We wanted to be free, we wanted to be different, and tried to be cool, as we call it now.&quot;

==The Beatles==
Kirchherr, Voormann and Vollmer were friends who had all attended the Meisterschule, and shared the same ideas about fashion, culture and music. Voormann became Astrid&#x27;s boyfriend, and moved into the Kirchherr home, where he had his own room. In 1960, after Kirchherr and Vollmer had had an argument with Voormann, he wandered down the Reeperbahn (in the St. Pauli district of Hamburg) and heard music coming from the Kaiserkeller club. Voormann walked in and watched a performance by a group called the Beatles: Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, Sutcliffe and Best, their drummer at the time. Voormann asked Kirchherr and Vollmer to listen to this new music, and after being persuaded to visit the Kaiserkeller (which was in the rough area of the Reeperbahn), Kirchherr decided that all she wanted to do was to be as close to the Beatles as she could. The trio of friends had never heard rock n&#x27; roll before, having previously listened to only trad jazz, with some Nat King Cole and The Platters mixed in. The trio then visited the Kaiserkeller almost every night, arriving at 9 o&#x27;clock and sitting by the front of the stage. Kirchherr later said: &quot;It was like a merry-go-round in my head, they looked absolutely astonishing... My whole life changed in a couple of minutes. All I wanted was to be with them and to know them.&quot;

Kirchherr later said that she, Voormann and Vollmer felt guilty about being German, and about Germany&#x27;s recent history. Meeting the Beatles was something very special for her, although she knew that English people would think that she ate sauerkraut, and would comment on her heavy German accent, but they made jokes about it together. Lennon would make sarcastic remarks from the stage, saying &quot;You Krauts, we won the war&quot;, knowing that very few Germans in the audience spoke English, but sailors from English-speaking countries present would roar with laughter.

Sutcliffe was fascinated by the trio, but especially Kirchherr, and thought they looked like &quot;real bohemians&quot;. Bill Harry later said that when Kirchherr walked in, every head would immediately turn her way, and that she always captivated the whole room. Sutcliffe wrote to a friend that he could hardly take his eyes off her and had tried to talk to Kirchherr during the next break, but she had already left the club. Sutcliffe managed to meet them eventually, and learned that all three had attended the Meisterschule, which was the same type of art college that Lennon and Sutcliffe had attended in Liverpool. (The &quot;Meisterschule für Mode, Textil, Grafik und Werbung&quot; - Master Craftspeoples&#x27; College for Fashion, Textile, Graphics, and Advertising - now called the University of Applied Sciences).

==Photographs==
Kirchherr asked the Beatles if they would mind letting her take photographs of them in a photo session, which impressed them, as other groups had only snapshots that were taken by friends. The next morning Kirchherr took photographs with a Rolleicord camera, at a fairground in a municipal park called &quot;Hamburger Dom&quot; which was close to the Reeperbahn, and in the afternoon she took them all (minus Best, who decided not to go) to her mother&#x27;s house in Altona. Kirchherr&#x27;s bedroom (which was all in black, including the furniture, with silver foil on the walls and a large tree branch suspended from the ceiling), was decorated especially for Voormann, with whom she had a relationship, although after the visits to the Kaiserkeller their relationship became purely platonic. Kirchherr started dating Sutcliffe, although she always remained a close friend of Voormann.

Kirchherr later supplied Sutcliffe and the other Beatles with Preludin, which, when taken with beer, made them feel euphoric and helped to keep them awake until the early hours of the morning. The Beatles had taken Preludin before, but it was only possible at the time to obtain Preludin with a doctor&#x27;s prescription note. Kirchherr&#x27;s mother received them from a local chemist, who supplied them without asking questions. After meeting Kirchherr, Lennon filled his letters to Cynthia Powell (his girlfriend at the time) with &quot;Astrid said this, Astrid did that&quot;, which made Powell jealous, until she read that Sutcliffe was in a relationship with Kirchherr. When Powell visited Hamburg with Dot Rhone (McCartney&#x27;s girlfriend at the time) in April 1961, they stayed at Kirchherr&#x27;s house. In August 1963, Kirchherr met Lennon and Cynthia in Paris while they were both there for a belated honeymoon, as Kirchherr was there with a girlfriend for a few days&#x27; holiday. The four of them went from wine bar to wine bar and finally ended up back at Kirchherr&#x27;s lodgings, where all four fell asleep on Kirchherr&#x27;s single bed.

The Beatles met Kirchherr again in Hamburg in 1966 when they were touring Germany, and Kirchherr gave Lennon the letters he had written to Sutcliffe in 1961 and 1962. Lennon said it was &quot;the best present I&#x27;ve had in years&quot;. All of the Beatles wrote many letters to Kirchherr: &quot;I only have a couple from George [Harrison], which I&#x27;ll never show anyone, but he wrote so many. So did the others. I probably threw them away. You do that when you&#x27;re young – you don&#x27;t think of the future.&quot; Harrison later asked Kirchherr to arrange the cover of his &quot;Wonderwall Music&quot; album in 1968.

===The Beatles haircut and clothes===

Kirchherr is credited with inventing the Beatles&#x27; moptop haircut although she disagreed, saying: &quot;All that rubbish people said, that I created their hairstyle, that&#x27;s rubbish! Lots of German boys had that hairstyle. Stuart [Sutcliffe] had it for a long while and the others copied it. I suppose the most important thing I contributed to them was friendship.&quot; In 1995, Kirchherr told BBC Radio Merseyside: &quot;All my friends in art school used to run around with this sort of what you call Beatles haircut. And my boyfriend then, Klaus Voormann, had this hairstyle, and Stuart liked it very very much. He was the first one who really got the nerve to get the Brylcreem out of his hair and asking me to cut his hair for him. Pete [Best] has really curly hair and it wouldn&#x27;t work.&quot; Kirchherr says that after she cut Sutcliffe&#x27;s hair, Harrison asked her to do the same when she was visiting Liverpool, and Lennon and McCartney had their hair cut in the same style while they were in Paris, by Kirchherr&#x27;s friend, Vollmer, who was living there at the time as an assistant to photographer William Klein.

After moving into the Kirchherr family&#x27;s house, Sutcliffe used to borrow her clothes, as he was the same height as Kirchherr. He wore her leather pants and jackets, collarless jackets, oversized shirts, and long scarves. He also borrowed a corduroy suit with no lapels that he wore on stage, which prompted Lennon to sarcastically ask if his mother had lent him the suit.

==Stuart Sutcliffe==

Sutcliffe wrote to friends that he was infatuated with Kirchherr, and asked her friends which colours, films, books and painters she liked, and whom she fancied. Best later commented that the beginning of their relationship was, &quot;like one of those fairy stories&quot;. Kirchherr says that she immediately fell in love with Sutcliffe, and referred to him as &quot;the love of my life&quot;. Kirchherr and Sutcliffe got engaged in November 1960, and exchanged rings, as is the German custom. Sutcliffe later wrote to his parents that he was engaged to Kirchherr, which they were shocked to learn, as they thought he would give up his career as an artist, although he told Kirchherr that he would like to be an art teacher in London or Germany in the future.

Kirchherr and Sutcliffe went to Liverpool in the summer of 1961, as Kirchherr wanted to meet Sutcliffe&#x27;s family (and to see Liverpool) before their marriage. Everybody was expecting a strange beatnik artist from Hamburg, but Kirchherr turned up at the Sutcliffes&#x27; house at 37 Aigburth Drive, Liverpool, bearing a single long-stemmed orchid in her hand as a present, and dressed in a round-necked cashmere sweater and tailored skirt.

In February 1962, Sutcliffe collapsed in the middle of an art class in Hamburg. He was suffering from intense headaches, and Kirchherr&#x27;s mother had German doctors perform checks on him, although they were unable to determine the cause of his headaches. While living at the Kirchherrs&#x27; house in Hamburg, his condition deteriorated. On 10 April 1962, Kirchherr received a phone call from her mother, who informed her that Sutcliffe had collapsed again, was brought back to the house and an ambulance had been called for. Kirchherr rushed home and rode with Sutcliffe in the ambulance, but he died in her arms before it reached the hospital.

Three days later Kirchherr met Lennon, McCartney and Best at the Hamburg airport (they were returning to Hamburg to perform) and told them Sutcliffe had died of a brain haemorrhage. Harrison and manager Brian Epstein arrived on another plane sometime later with Sutcliffe&#x27;s mother, who had been informed by telegram. Harrison and Lennon were helpful towards the distraught Kirchherr, with Lennon telling her one day that she definitely had to decide if she wanted to &quot;live or die, there is no other question.&quot;

==Freelance photographer==

In 1964, Kirchherr became a freelance photographer, and with her colleague Max Scheler she took &quot;behind the scenes&quot; photographs of the Beatles during the filming of &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, as an assignment for the German &quot;Stern&quot; magazine. Epstein had forbidden any publicity photographs to be taken without his permission, but Kirchherr phoned Harrison, who said he would arrange it, but added, &quot;Only if they pay you.&quot;
&quot;Stern&quot; phoned Bill Harry at his &quot;Mersey Beat&quot; newspaper and asked if he could arrange a photograph of all the groups in Liverpool, so Harry suggested Kirchherr be the photographer, although Kirchherr later said she placed an advertisement in the &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot; newspaper. Kirchherr and Scheler said that any group who wanted their photograph taken in front of St. George&#x27;s Hall would be paid per musician, but over 200 groups turned up on the day, which meant Kirchherr and Scheler soon ran out of money. Kirchherr didn&#x27;t publish the photographs until 1995, in a book called &quot;Liverpool Days&quot;, which is a limited-edition collection of black-and-white photographs. In 1999, a companion book called &quot;Hamburg Days&quot; was published (a two-volume limited edition), containing a set of photographs by Kirchherr and &quot;memory drawings&quot; by Voormann. The drawings are recollections of places and situations that Voormann clearly remembers, but Kirchherr had never photographed, or had lost the photographs.

Kirchherr described how difficult it was to be accepted as a female photographer in the 1960s: &quot;Every magazine and newspaper wanted me to photograph the Beatles again. Or they wanted my old stuff, even if it was out of focus, whether they were nice or not. They wouldn&#x27;t look at my other work. It was very hard for a girl photographer in the 60s to be accepted. In the end I gave up. I&#x27;ve hardly taken a photo since 1967.&quot; 
Kirchherr was quoted as saying that &quot;When We Was Fab&quot; (Genesis Publications 2007), would be her last book of photographs: &quot;I have decided it is time to create one book in which I am totally involved so that it contains the pictures I like most, printed the way I would print them, even down to the text and design... This book is me and that is why it will be the last one. The very last one.&quot;

Kirchherr expressed respect for other photographers, such as Annie Leibovitz (because of the humour in her work), Irving Penn, Richard Avedon, Jim Rakete and Reinhard Wolf (German Wikipedia), and French film-makers François Truffaut, and Jean Cocteau. Kirchherr said that her favourite photos are the ones she took of Sutcliffe by the Baltic sea, and of Lennon and Harrison in her attic room at 45a Eimsbütteler Strasse. She expressed reservations about digital photography, saying that a photographer should concentrate on the art of photography and not on the technical results, although admitting that she knew nothing about computers and was &quot;afraid of the internet&quot;.

Kirchherr admitted she was not good at business because of insufficient organisation, and had never really looked after the negatives of her photographs to prove ownership. Her business partner Ulf Krüger—a songwriter and record producer—successfully found many of Astrid&#x27;s negatives and photographs and had them copyrighted, although he believes that Kirchherr lost over the years because of people using her photographs without permission. In July 2001, Kirchherr visited Liverpool to open an exhibition of her work at the Mathew Street art gallery, which is close to the former site of The Cavern Club. She appeared as a guest at the city&#x27;s Beatles Week Festival during the August Bank Holiday. Kirchherr&#x27;s work has been exhibited internationally in places, such as Hamburg, Bremen, London, Liverpool, New York City, Washington D.C., Tokyo, Vienna, and at the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Hall of Fame.

==Later life==

In 1967, Kirchherr married English drummer Gibson Kemp (born Gibson Stewart Kemp, August 1945, Liverpool, Lancashire), who had replaced Ringo Starr in Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. The marriage ended in divorce after seven years. She then worked as a barmaid, as an interior designer, and then for a music publishing firm, getting married for a second time to a German businessman.
Kirchherr worked as an advisor in 1994 on the film &quot;Backbeat&quot;, which portrayed Kirchherr, Sutcliffe and the Beatles during their early days in Hamburg. She was impressed with Stephen Dorff (who played Sutcliffe in the film), commenting that he was the right age (19 years old at the time), and his gestures, the way he smoked, and talked were so like Sutcliffe&#x27;s that she had goose pimples. Kirchherr was portrayed in the film by Sheryl Lee.

Starting in the mid-1990s, Kirchherr and business partner Krüger operated the K&amp;K photography shop in Hamburg, offering custom vintage prints, books and artwork for sale. K&amp;K periodically helped arrange Beatles&#x27; conventions and other Beatles&#x27; events in the Hamburg area. She commented in 1995: &quot;My [second] marriage ended in 1985... I regretted I had no children. I just couldn&#x27;t see me have any. But now I am pleased when I see the situation the world is in. I live alone and am very happy.&quot;

Kirchherr died on 12 May 2020 in Hamburg, following &quot;a short, serious illness&quot;, a week prior to her 82nd birthday. News of her death was first announced by Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn via Twitter. He praised her involvement with the band as &quot;immeasurable&quot;, and credited her as an &quot;intelligent, inspirational, innovative, daring, artistic, awake, aware, beautiful, smart, loving and uplifting friend to many&quot;.

<text>The South Bay is a region of the Los Angeles metropolitan area, located in the southwest corner of Los Angeles County. The name stems from its geographic location stretching along the southern shore of Santa Monica Bay. The South Bay contains sixteen cities plus portions of the City of Los Angeles and unincorporated portions of the county. The area is bounded by the Pacific Ocean on the south and west and generally by the City of Los Angeles on the north and east.

== Neighborhoods ==
The South Bay includes:
*The Beach Cities
**El Segundo
**Hermosa Beach
**Manhattan Beach
**Redondo Beach
**Torrance
*The Palos Verdes Peninsula
**Palos Verdes Estates
**Rancho Palos Verdes
**Rolling Hills
**Rolling Hills Estates
*Neighborhoods of the City of Los Angeles
**Harbor City
**Harbor Gateway
**San Pedro
**Westchester
**Wilmington
*Inland cities of the South Bay
**Carson
**Gardena
**Hawthorne
**Inglewood
**Lawndale
**Lomita
*And unincorporated areas of L.A. County including:
**Alondra Park/El Camino Village 
**Del Aire/Wiseburn
**West Rancho Dominguez
**Lennox
**Westfield/Academy Hills
**West Carson
The region is bordered on the north by the Westside region of Los Angeles, on the northeast by the South Los Angeles region and on the east and southeast by the Gateway Cities.

==South Bay Cities Council of Governments==
The South Bay Cities Council of Governments (SBCCOG) is a joint powers authority government agency made of politicians from the sixteen South Bay cities and unincorporated Los Angeles County that share the goal of maximizing the quality of life and productivity of the South Bay region of Los Angeles. The SBCCOG members are Carson, El Segundo, Gardena, Hawthorne, Hermosa Beach, Inglewood, Lawndale, Lomita, Manhattan Beach, Palos Verdes Estates, Rancho Palos Verdes, Redondo Beach, Rolling Hills, Rolling Hills Estates, Torrance, the Harbor City/San Pedro/Wilmington communities of the City of Los Angeles and the unincorporated areas of the County of Los Angeles District 2 and 4.

==Major employers==

===Port of Los Angeles===
The Port of Los Angeles, sprawling across the shorelines of San Pedro and Wilmington, is the busiest in the United States. When combined with the Port of Long Beach, it is the fifth-busiest in the world. Traditionally, most of the populations of Wilmington and San Pedro have worked for the port in some capacity. It is increasingly the primary driver of the Southern California economy. Industrial growth in the Inland Empire is almost entirely attributable to increased port traffic since the 1980s. The massive increase in cargo volume has created significant air pollution (especially of particulate matter in neighboring communities, resulting from the combustion of low-grade marine diesel fuel).

===Aerospace===
The South Bay is the traditional home of Southern California&#x27;s aerospace industry. While considerably shrunken from its Cold War peak, it still represents a major economic force, employing thousands in high-skill, high-wage engineering positions and generating enormous amounts of tax revenue. Northrop Grumman has a major facility in El Segundo where the F/A-18 Hornet fuselage is manufactured, as well as the headquarters of the Space Technology division in Redondo Beach and a facility at the Hawthorne Municipal Airport. Howmet Fastening Systems, a subsidiary of Howmet Aerospace, has their corporate headquarters located in Torrance with manufacturing facilities in both Torrance and Carson. Boeing and Lockheed Martin also maintain extensive production facilities throughout the South Bay and Raytheon maintains a facility in El Segundo. The Los Angeles Air Force Base and neighboring Aerospace Corporation in El Segundo are a main focus of aerospace research activity and serve as the primary development facilities for military satellites and other space programs. DirecTV, a former subsidiary of Hughes Aircraft, is also headquartered in El Segundo for the same reason. SpaceX is also headquartered in the South Bay in Hawthorne.

===Oil refining===
Petroleum refining is another important component of the South Bay&#x27;s economy. Major South Bay refiners include Tesoro (ARCO facility in Carson), Chevron (El Segundo), Phillips 66 (Wilmington), PBF Energy (Torrance), Tesoro (Wilmington), and Valero (Wilmington). These refiners supply a large share of petroleum products for Southern California as well as for Nevada and Arizona.

===Automotive===
Japanese automobile manufacturer Honda maintains its North American headquarters in the South Bay, in the city of Torrance. (Nissan was also headquartered in the South Bay until late 2005, but relocated to Tennessee, citing the high cost of running a business in California. Toyota relocated to Plano, Texas in 2017 for many of the same reasons.) While these locations are largely the legacy of the region&#x27;s historical importance as a Japanese-American population center, it has proven fortunate for two reasons; first, it enables closer oversight of vehicle import operations at the nearby ports; and second, it gives them proximity to the automobile customization culture that is prominent in nearby South Los Angeles. Tesla is stationed near the headquarters of SpaceX in Hawthorne.

==Transportation==
The Harbor (I-110), San Diego (I-405), Gardena (SR 91), and Century (I-105) Freeways provide the region with its principal transportation links.

The Los Angeles MTA&#x27;s A Line (opened in 1990 as the Blue Line) is a light rail line running between Downtown Los Angeles and Downtown Long Beach. It was the first of the MTA&#x27;s modern rail lines since the 1961 demise of the Pacific Electric Railway&#x27;s Red Car system. The C Line (opened in 1995 as the Green Line, together with the Glenn Anderson Freeway), a freeway-median light rail line, also serves the South Bay. It runs between Redondo Beach and Norwalk in the median of the Century Freeway (Interstate 105), providing indirect access to LAX via a shuttle bus and future automated people mover. The K Line opened from Expo/Crenshaw station to Westchester/Veterans station, but is expected to be fully operational to Aviation/Imperial station in 2024.

Several ports and harbors in the South Bay provide access to Santa Catalina Island, a popular resort. In addition, LAX borders El Segundo to the north in the neighborhood of Westchester, Los Angeles. The area is also home to two public airports; Zamperini Field in Torrance and Hawthorne Municipal Airport in Hawthorne.

==Media==
In addition to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, the South Bay cities are served by daily papers, the &quot;Daily Breeze&quot;, the weeklies &quot;The Beach Reporter,&quot; &quot;The Easy Reader and South Bay Community News&quot;, a bi-monthly real estate magazine, &quot;South Bay DIGS&quot; and lifestyle publication &#x27;Southbay Magazine&#x27;. The National Football League has its West Coast headquarters and production facility for NFL Network, NFL RedZone and the NFL.com app in Inglewood.

==Music==
The South Bay has a rich history in music, and has produced a number of significant rock bands, like Hawthorne natives The Beach Boys in the early 1960s, and continuing particularly in punk music. Other notable South Bay-based artists include:
* 98 Mute (Hermosa Beach)

==Sports and entertainment==
The South Bay is host to many professional sports teams and entertainment venues. The Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers of the National Football League play at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood. The LA Galaxy of Major League Soccer play their home games at Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson. 

The Los Angeles Clippers of the National Basketball Association will play in their new stadium, Intuit Dome, in Inglewood beginning 2024.

Various entertainment venues are located in the South Bay, including SoFi Stadium, Kia Forum, and YouTube Theater in Inglewood, Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, and Toyota Sports Center in El Segundo. Three casinos also operate in the South Bay; the Hollywood Park Casino in Inglewood and the Normandie Casino and Hustler Casino in Gardena.

<text>Wiiija was a British independent record label founded in 1988 by staff from the Rough Trade Shop in Notting Hill, London. The name Wiiija is a corruption of W11 1JA, the postcode of the Rough Trade Shop in Talbot Street.

The label was notable for introducing the band Therapy? and releasing the first records by Silverfish, Huggy Bear and Cornershop. Notable later releases included Free Kitten and Bis while the commercial success of Cornershop from 1997 rewarded the label&#x27;s long-term support.

Wiiija became loosely associated with the early UK riot grrrl scene as a result of releases by Huggy Bear and Blood Sausage, as well as the &quot;Some Hearts Paid To Lie&quot; EP which featured Comet Gain, Skinned Teen, Linus and Pussycat Trash. Labelmates Cornershop can be seen along with Huggy Bear and Blood Sausage in the 1994 tour documentary &quot;Getting Close To Nothing&quot;.

In 1996 it became a subsidiary of Beggars Banquet Records and remained active until the early 2000s.
