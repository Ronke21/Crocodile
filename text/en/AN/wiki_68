<text>The Bristol Blenheim is a British light bomber designed and built by the Bristol Aeroplane Company, which was used extensively in the first two years of the Second World War, with examples still being used as trainers until the end of the war. Development began with the &quot;Type 142&quot;, a civil airliner, after a challenge from the newspaper proprietor Lord Rothermere to produce the fastest commercial aircraft in Europe. The &quot;Type 142&quot; first flew in April 1935, and the Air Ministry, ordered a modified design as the &quot;Type 142M&quot; for the Royal Air Force (RAF) as a bomber.

Deliveries of the new Blenheim to RAF squadrons commenced on 10 March 1937. In service the Type 142M became the Blenheim Mk.I which would be developed into the long-nosed Type 149, the Blenheim Mk.IV, except in Canada where Fairchild Canada built the Type 149 under licence as the Bolingbroke. The Type 160 Bisley was also developed from the Blenheim but was already obsolete when it entered service.

Both versions were converted into heavy fighters by the addition of a gun pack with four Browning machine guns mounted under the fuselage. The Mk.IV was also used as a maritime patrol aircraft and both aircraft were also used as bombing and gunnery trainers once they had become obsolete as combat aircraft.

The Blenheim was one of the first British aircraft with an all-metal stressed-skin construction, retractable landing gear, flaps, a powered gun turret and variable-pitch propellers. The Mk.I was faster than most of the RAF&#x27;s biplane fighters in the late 1930s but advances soon left it vulnerable if flown in daylight, though it proved successful as a night fighter. The Blenheim was effective as a bomber but many were shot down. Both Blenheim types were used by foreign operators and examples were licence built in Yugoslavia and Finland, in addition to Canada.

==Development==
===Origins===
In 1933 Frank Barnwell, Bristol&#x27;s chief designer, went to the United States to collect first-hand information on their latest twin-engined, low-wing monoplane airliners. When he returned home he discussed one of them, the Lockheed Electra 12A, with Roy Fedden and prepared a design to match it using Fedden&#x27;s Bristol Aquila engine which produced 500 hp, the same power as the engine used in the Electra. Sir Archibald Russell described Barnwell&#x27;s design as &quot;close to being a replica of the Electra&quot;. It was designated &quot;Type 135&quot;.

In early 1934, Lord Rothermere, owner of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; newspaper, challenged the British aviation industry to build a high-speed aircraft capable of carrying six passengers and two crew members – he referred to the ambition as seeking &quot;the fastest commercial aeroplane in Europe, if not the world&quot;. German firms were producing record-breaking high-speed designs, such as the single-engined Heinkel He 70, and Rothermere wanted the prestige of being able to claim to have the fastest civilian aircraft. Rothermere also intended to encourage businesses and key figures to make greater use of civil aviation and to demonstrate to the British Air Ministry how their fighter aircraft may not be able to match modern transport aircraft, which may be easily converted to, or used as the basis for, a bomber aircraft.

Rothermere became aware of Bristol&#x27;s &quot;Type 135&quot; proposal and on 3 March 1934, Barnwell issued him with a quote of the specification and performance statistics of the design, including an estimated top speed of at . The Aquila engine had been shelved in favour of the supercharger-equipped, poppet-valve Bristol Mercury engine. Deeming it suitable for the challenge, the design of Type 135 was further adapted to produce the &quot;Type 142&quot; to meet the requirements outlined by Rothermere. In late March 1934, Rothermere placed an order for a &quot;Type 142&quot; aircraft, under which he paid for half of the estimated £18,500 cost up front and the remainder upon the aircraft&#x27;s first flight in the following year.
On 12 April 1935, the &quot;Type 142&quot;, named &quot;Britain First&quot;, conducted its maiden flight from Filton Aerodrome, South Gloucestershire. Flight tests soon proved that the aircraft was faster than the fighters in service with the Royal Air Force (RAF), having a top speed of . Rothermere presented the aircraft to the nation for a formal evaluation as a potential bomber. By June 1935, the Air Ministry had become interested in the project due to its high performance. On 9 July 1935, a design conference was held by Bristol at the ministry&#x27;s request into the question of converting the &quot;Type 142&quot; into a medium bomber.

The Air Ministry quickly formalised Specification B.28/35 for prototypes of a bomber version; the &quot;Type 142M&quot; (M for military). One change between the &quot;Type 142M&quot; bomber and its &quot;Type 142&quot; predecessor was the repositioning of the wing from a low-wing to a mid-wing position, which allowed for more internal space within the fuselage underneath the main spar to accommodate a sizeable bomb bay. Other modifications included the addition of a bomb-aimer&#x27;s position and a Browning machine gun in the port wing along with provisions for a semi-retractable gun turret in the dorsal position.

===Production===
In September 1935, an initial contract for 150 aircraft was placed. The Air Ministry had chosen to order the type directly from the drawing board, having been urgently sought as one piece of a wider and rapid expansion of the RAF. The first aircraft built of this production model, &quot;K7033&quot;, served as the only prototype; on 25 June 1936, &quot;K7033&quot; conducted its first flight from Filton. The service name for the aircraft became &quot;Blenheim Mk I&quot; after the famous battle during the War of the Spanish Succession. On 10 March 1937, production deliveries to the RAF formally started; 114 Squadron became the first squadron to receive the Blenheim. On 13 January 1938, the Blenheim entered service with No. 30 Squadron, the first overseas squadron to receive the type; in early 1939, the first Blenheims arrived in India.

From July 1936 onwards, various additional orders were placed for the &quot;Blenheim Mk I&quot;, including multiple orders for the export market. By the end of 1936, 1,568 aircraft were on order. In order to meet the demand, secondary assembly lines were established at Chadderton by Avro and at Speke by Rootes Securities. The aircraft was built under licence by foreign countries, including Finland, who completed a total of 55 aircraft, and Yugoslavia, which completed 16 aircraft with a further 24 in advanced stages of completion when Germany invaded Yugoslavia. Other countries also procured the Blenheim, including Romania, Greece and Turkey. By September 1939, orders for the Blenheim had risen to 2,088 aircraft. Total production of the &quot;Blenheim Mk I&quot; in England was 1,351 aircraft prior to the end of the production run in 1939; production had been terminated in favour of more advanced variants.

The Blenheim production programme saw several shifts in requirements and in capacity. A modified Blenheim design, given the name &quot;Bolingbroke&quot;, was manufactured under licence in Canada by Fairchild Aircraft. The Bolingbroke, which had been developed in response to Air Ministry Specification G.24/35 to procure a coastal reconnaissance/light bomber as a replacement for the Avro Anson, had substantial improvements that would serve as the basis for improved variants of the Blenheim. Both the navigator&#x27;s station and range limitations of the Blenheim Mk.I had been subject to considerable criticism, prompting the development of an improved model to rectify the shortcomings. On 24 September 1937, an experimental Blenheim Mk.I, modified with an extended forward fuselage beyond its original stepless cockpit, smooth-fronted nose enclosure, made its first flight from Filton.

===Further development===
Formal work on an extended-range reconnaissance version started as the Blenheim Mk II, which increased tankage from . Only one Blenheim Mk II was completed, as flight tests revealed the increase in speed to be marginal and not warranting further development. Another modification resulted in the Blenheim Mk III, which lengthened the nose, dispensing with the &quot;stepless cockpit&quot; format of the Mk.I, introducing a true windscreen in front of the pilot, to provide more room for the bomb aimer. This required the nose to be &quot;scooped out&quot; in front of the pilot to maintain visibility during takeoff and landing. Both modifications were combined, along with a newer version of the Mercury engine with . The turret acquired a pair of Brownings in place of the original single Vickers K gun, creating the Blenheim Mk IV.
In early 1939, the first batch of Blenheim Mk IVs were accepted into service; these lacked outer fuel tanks but were accepted due to the urgent demand for the type. Early Blenheim Mk IVs were also equipped with the Mercury VIII engine, most were fitted with the more powerful Mercury XV or Mercury 25 models. Further aircraft deliveries were made to the production standard and were primarily manufactured by Avro and Rootes. Production of the Blenheim IV continued until June 1943, when newcomers such as the Beaufort-derived Beaufighter had succeeded the type. A total of 3,307 were produced.

A long-range fighter version, the Blenheim Mk IF, was also developed. For this role, about 200 Blenheims were fitted with a gun pack under the fuselage for four Brownings. Later, the Airborne Intercept (AI) Mk III or IV radar was fitted to some aircraft in use as night fighters; these were the first British fighters to be equipped with radar. The Blenheim had been selected as the first aircraft to be adapted for this role as its fuselage was sufficiently roomy to accommodate the additional crew member and radar apparatus. Their performance was marginal as a fighter but they served as an interim type pending availability of the more capable Beaufighter derivative. About 60 Mk IVs were also equipped with the gun pack as the Mk IVF and were used by Coastal Command to protect convoys from German long-range bombers.

The last bomber variant was conceived as an armoured ground attack aircraft, with a solid nose containing four more Browning machine guns. Originally known as the Bisley, (after the shooting competitions held at Bisley Ranges), the production aircraft were renamed Blenheim Mk V and featured a strengthened structure, pilot armour, interchangeable nose gun pack or bomb-aimer position and another Mercury variant with . The Mk V was ordered for conventional bombing operations, with the removal of armour and most of the glazed nose section. The Mk V (Type 160) was used primarily in the Middle East and Far East. The Blenheim served as the basis for the Beaufort torpedo bomber, which led to the Beaufighter, with the lineage performing two evolutions of bomber-to-fighter.

==Design==

The Bristol Blenheim was a twin-engine high performance all-metal medium bomber aircraft, powered by a pair of Bristol Mercury VIII air-cooled radial engines, each capable of . Each engine drove a three-bladed controllable-pitch propeller, and were equipped with both hand-based and electric engine starters. To ease maintenance, the engine mountings were designed with a split-segment to facilitate rapid engine removal without disturbing the carburettors. A pair of fuel tanks, each containing up to 140 gallons, were housed within the centre-section of the fuselage.

The fuselage of the Blenheim employed a light-alloy monocoque structure using open-section stringers, and was constructed in three sections. The wing is also built in three sections, the centre-section of which is bolted and rivetted to the fuselage. The outer wing sections are tapered in chord and thickness. Extensive use of Alclad sheeting is made in elements such as the ribs, skin, flaps, and web reinforcement of the spars. The tail unit is of a cantilever monoplane style, using an all-metal tailplane and fin while the aerodynamically-balanced rudder and elevators use a metal frame covered with fabric. The undercarriage was hydraulically-retracted, with an auxiliary hand-pump for emergency actuation; medium-pressure tyres were used, complete with pneumatically-actuated differentially-control brakes.

The Blenheim typically carried a crew of three – pilot, navigator/bombardier and wireless (radio) operator/air gunner. The pilot&#x27;s quarters on the left side of the nose were so cramped that the control yoke obscured all flight instruments while engine instruments eliminated the forward view on landings. Most secondary instruments were arranged along the left side of the cockpit, essential items such as the propeller pitch control were actually placed behind the pilot where they had to be operated by feel alone. The navigator/bombardier was seated alongside the pilot, and made use of a sliding/folding seat whilst performing the bomb aiming role. Dual flight controls could be installed. The wireless operator/air gunner was housed aft of the wing alongside the aircraft&#x27;s dorsal gun turret.
Armament comprised a single forward-firing  Browning machine gun outboard of the port engine and a Lewis Gun in a semi-retracting Bristol Type B Mk I dorsal turret firing to the rear. From 1939, the Lewis gun was replaced by the more modern Vickers VGO machine-gun. A bomb load could be carried in the internal bomb bay set into the centre section of the fuselage. Like most contemporary British aircraft, the bomb bay doors were kept closed with bungee cords and opened under the weight of the released bombs. Because there was no way to predict how long it would take for the bombs to force the doors open, bombing accuracy was consequently poor. The bomb bay could be loaded using a hand-operated winch incorporated into the fuselage.

To achieve its relatively high speed, the Blenheim used a very small fuselage cross-section, with its upper front glazing all at one angle in the form of a &quot;stepless cockpit&quot; that used no separate windscreen panels for the pilot, a notable feature of a substantial majority of German bomber designs, first conceived during the war years. Both fixed and sliding window panels were present, along with a transparent sliding roof. Other onboard equipment included a radio, cameras, navigation systems, electric lighting, oxygen apparatus, and stowage for parachutes and clothing.

==Operational history==
===Outbreak of war===
In September 1939, the month in which the Second World War broke out, the Blenheim Mk I equipped two home-based squadrons and 11 overseas squadrons in locations such as Egypt, Aden, Iraq, India, and Singapore. Further RAF squadrons had received, or were in the process of converting to, the more capable Blenheim Mk IV; 168 Blenheim Mk IV aircraft had entered RAF operational strength by the outbreak of war.

On the day that war was declared on Germany, a Blenheim Mk IV, &quot;N6215&quot;, piloted by Flying Officer Andrew McPherson was the first British aircraft to cross the German coast to perform a high altitude reconnaissance mission upon the German Navy in the vicinity of Wilhelmshaven, Lower Saxony. The following morning, 15 Blenheims from three squadrons set off on one of the first bombing missions to attack the ships spotted on the previous day. The raid was a failure, only nine aircraft attacked, and only superficial damage was done to the cruiser &quot;Emden&quot;, when one of No. 107 Squadron&#x27;s Blenheims crashed into the cruiser, killing 11 crewmen. RAF Coastal Command were soon using the Blenheim with the stated mission of protecting British shipping convoys off the east coast.

Shortly after the conflict&#x27;s start, the RAF Advanced Air Striking Force (AASF) was deployed to numerous airfields in France, allowing for shorter range bombing missions against German targets, including industries. Several squadrons of Blenheim IVs were assigned to the AASF, being frequently used against targets in France and the Low Countries once the Battle of France had begun. Blenheims were also assigned to the air component of the British Expeditionary Force of the Army.

In May 1940, AASF and BEF Blenheims participated in the Battle of France, being sent against German forces moving towards Brussels, resulting in many aircraft quickly sustaining heavy damage or being lost to enemy fire. German attacks upon the French airfields also damaged a considerable number of Blenheims on the ground. On 14 May, a combined force of Fairey Battles and Blenheims was dispatched on a counter-attack upon German forces as they broke through defensive lines: 40 out of 71 aircraft were lost in this sortie. This is claimed to be the highest ever losses known to the RAF. Further action by Blenheims of Bomber Command that day sustained a 25% aircraft loss despite a high level of British fighter cover. Shortly thereafter, the mostly-depleted squadrons were withdrawn to Britain. Around 50 Blenheims supported the Dunkirk evacuation by harassing enemy forces.

Rapid advances in technology which had taken place in the late 1930s had rendered the Blenheim mostly obsolete by the outbreak of the war. In particular, it had become heavier as extra service equipment was installed; much of this was found to be necessary through operational experience. This, coupled with the rapid performance increases of the fighters that would oppose it, had eclipsed the Blenheim&#x27;s speed advantage. In January 1941, the Air Staff classified the Blenheim as inadequate in terms of performance and armament for current operations.

The light armament was seldom able to deter fighter opposition. Squadrons were forced to use several different improvisations in an attempt to provide better defensive armament, until officially sanctioned modifications were able to be introduced in early 1940. The Blenheim also proved to be vulnerable to anti-aircraft artillery, especially around the rear fuselage. Flexible, self-sealing liners had been fitted to the fuel tanks but they were still not fully protected against the MG FF cannon carried by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s Bf 109 and Bf 110 fighters.

===Home front===
Blenheim squadrons were still in immediate and high demand after their withdrawal from France as part of the British action during the Norwegian campaign. Typically operating from bases in the northern areas of the British mainland, such as RAF Lossiemouth, flying for extended periods over the North Sea led to the weather posing almost as much of a risk as enemy combatants, particularly as most of the Blenheim IVs lacked any heating or deicing systems; in response, some aircraft were later equipped with boilers fixed onto the starboard engine exhaust. A sizeable number of losses occurred, caused by both enemy action and mid-air engine failures due to icing.

After the fall of France in June 1940, the Free French Air Force was formed at RAF Odiham, Hampshire, in the form of &quot;Groupe Mixte de Combat&quot; (GMC) 1, consisting of a mixed bag of Blenheims and Westland Lysander liaison/observation aircraft, which were later dispatched to North Africa and saw action against Italian and German forces.
Blenheim units operated throughout the Battle of Britain, often taking heavy casualties, although they were never accorded the publicity of the fighter squadrons. From July to December 1940, Blenheims raided German-occupied airfields both in daylight and at night. Although most of these raids were unproductive, there were some successes; on 1 August five out of twelve Blenheims sent to attack Haamstede and Evere (Brussels) were able to bomb, damaging (50 per cent, 40 per cent and 10 per cent) three Bf 109Es of II./JG 27 at Leuwarden and apparently killing a &quot;Staffelkapitän&quot; identified as &quot;Hauptmann&quot; Albrecht von Ankum-Frank. Two other 109s were claimed by Blenheim gunners. Another successful raid on Haamstede was made by a single Blenheim on 7 August which destroyed one 109 of 4./JG 54, heavily damaged another, and caused lighter damage to four more.

There were also some missions which produced an almost 100% casualty rate amongst the Blenheims. One such operation was mounted on 13 August 1940 against a &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; airfield near Aalborg in north-western Denmark by twelve aircraft of 82 Squadron. One Blenheim returned early (the pilot was later charged but was killed on another operation before a court martial was held); the other eleven, which reached Denmark, were shot down, five by flak and six by Bf 109s. Blenheim units had also been formed to carry out long-range strategic reconnaissance missions over Germany and German-occupied territories. In this role, the Blenheims once again proved to be too slow and vulnerable against &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; fighters and they took constant casualties.
On 12 August 1941, an action described by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 2006 as being the &quot;RAF&#x27;s most audacious and dangerous low-level bombing raid, a large-scale attack against power stations near Cologne&quot; took place. The raid was a low-level daylight raid by 54 Blenheims under the command of Wing Commander Nichol of 114 Squadron. They hit their targets (Fortuna Power Station in Oberaußem-Fortuna and the Goldenberg Power Station in Hürth-Knapsack), but twelve of the Blenheims were lost during the raid, 22% of those that took part, which was far above the sustainable loss rate of less than 5%. The England cricketer Squadron leader Bill Edrich was awarded the DFC for his part in the raid.

From 5 September 1940 Blenheims of Bomber Command began a bombing campaign targeting German-occupied ports along the English Channel, alongside heavier bomber types. Bomber Command Blenheims also performed anti-shipping patrols due to Coastal Command&#x27;s own strike squadrons being heavily depleted throughout the latter half of 1940. On 11 March 1940, a Blenheim IV, &quot;P4852&quot;, became the first RAF aircraft to sink a U-boat, having scored two direct hits on in the Schillig Roads. In April 1941, a campaign aiming to completely close off the Channel to enemy shipping was launched using an initial flight of Blenheims stationed at RAF Manston. Between April and June that year, a total of 297 Blenheims of No 2. Group attacked German shipping at sea, losing 36 aircraft, while Coastal Command launched 143 attacks in the same period, losing 52 aircraft; by the end of the year, 698 ships had been attacked and 41 of these sunk for the loss of 123 aircraft.

====Fighter operations====

The Bristol Blenheim was used by both Bomber and Fighter Commands. About two hundred Mk I bombers were modified into Mk IF long-range fighters with 600 Squadron (Auxiliary Air Force) based at Hendon, the first squadron to take delivery in September 1938. By 1939, at least seven squadrons were operating them as fighters, increasing to about 60 squadrons within a few months. The Mk IF proved to be slower and less manoeuvrable than expected, and by June 1940 daylight Blenheim losses caused concern for Fighter Command. The Mk IF was relegated mainly to night fighter duties where 23 Squadron, which had already operated them at night, soon relegated them to night intruder operations as they were not effective as night fighters.

In the German night-bombing raid on London on 18 June 1940, Blenheims accounted for five German bombers, thus proving that they were better-suited for night fighting. In July, No. 600 Squadron, by then based at RAF Manston, had some of its Mk IFs equipped with AI Mk III radar. With this radar equipment, a Blenheim from the Fighter Interception Unit (FIU) at RAF Ford achieved the first success on the night of 2–3 July 1940, accounting for a Dornier Do 17 bomber. The Blenheim was replaced by the faster and more heavily-armed Bristol Beaufighter in 1940–1941.

===Mediterranean and Middle East===

On 11 June 1940, only hours after Italy&#x27;s entry into the war on Germany&#x27;s side, several Blenheim IVs bombed Italian positions. In mid-1940, reinforcement ferry routes were established throughout Africa, starting in Takoradi on the Gold Coast. By the end of 1940, a total of three RAF squadrons equipped with Blenheim IV aircraft were performing anti-shipping, bombing, and reconnaissance missions in support of Allied ground forces in North Africa.

By July 1941, it had been recognised that, in response to the increasing intensity of combat in North Africa and in the Middle East theatres, additional squadrons were urgently required. In the latter half of 1941, several Blenheim squadrons were flown out to Malta, many being stationed there into early 1942 before mainly being absorbed in the Western Desert air operations. As Bomber Command gradually took Blenheims out of the Northern Europe theatre, they were often dispatched to other areas such as North Africa. Upon the outbreak of the Pacific War in December 1941, some Blenheim squadrons in the Middle East were relocated from the theatre to the Far East in response to the new threat from Japanese forces.

===South East Asia===
Blenheims continued to operate widely in many combat roles until about 1943, equipping RAF squadrons in the UK and at British bases in Aden, India, British Malaya, Singapore, and the Dutch East Indies. Many Blenheims were lost to Japanese fighters during the Malayan Campaign and the battles for Singapore and Sumatra. By that point, the traditional daylight light bomber role was more effectively carried out by suitable fighter-bombers, and the surviving examples were relegated to training duties. Nonetheless, the Blenheim played a role in preventing India from falling and in recapturing Burma, destroying over 60 aircraft on the ground in raids on Bangkok early in the campaign.

One Blenheim pilot, Squadron Leader Arthur Scarf, was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for an attack on Singora, Thailand, on 9 December 1941. Another bomber of No. 60 Squadron RAF was credited with shooting down Lt Col Tateo Katō&#x27;s Nakajima Ki-43 fighter and badly damaging two others in a single engagement on 22 May 1942, over the Bay of Bengal. Katō&#x27;s death was a severe blow to the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force.

The Air Ministry&#x27;s replacement for the Blenheim as a daylight bomber, another Bristol design, the Buckingham, was overtaken by events and changes in requirements, and considered inferior to the de Havilland Mosquito, and as such did not see combat. The final ground-attack version – the Blenheim Mk V – first equipped 139 Squadron in June 1942. Eventually thirteen squadrons – mainly in the Middle East and Far East – received this variant but operated them generally only for a few months.

One Blenheim Mk IV left in Java by the retreating British forces in 1942 ended up in the hands of the fledgling Indonesian Air Force (AURI). They repaired it, installed Nakajima Sakae engines, painted it in their colours, and flew it around Yogyakarta on at least three occasions.

====First attack on the Japanese carrier force====
On 9 April 1942, nine Blenheims from 11 Squadron attacked the 1st Air Fleet (&quot;Kidō Butai&quot;); the Imperial Japanese main carrier battle group (Admiral Chūichi Nagumo). The Blenheims approached undetected by the A6M2 Zero combat air patrol (CAP) fighters and surprised the Japanese carrier battle group. While the bombers attacked fleet carrier from an altitude of , they missed. Four of the Blenheims were shot down over the carriers by CAP &quot;Zeroes&quot; (two of which were claimed by ace-fighter pilot Kaname Harada from ) and by other Japanese aircraft returning from the earlier attack on , shooting down two &quot;Zeroes&quot; in return. This was the first time a Japanese carrier force had faced a concerted air attack in the Pacific War.

===Finland===

In 1936, the Finnish Air Force became the first export customer for the Blenheim, ordering 18 Blenheim Mk Is, which were delivered from Britain between June 1937 and July 1938. Two years later, Finland obtained a manufacturing licence for the Blenheim. Before any aircraft could be manufactured at the &quot;Valtion lentokonetehdas&quot; (State Aeroplane Factory) in Finland, the Winter War broke out, forcing the Finns to order more aircraft from the UK. A further 24 British-manufactured Blenheims were ordered during the Winter War and were delivered from the RAF&#x27;s own stocks.

In the aftermath of the Winter War, 55 Blenheims were constructed in Finland, the final aircraft being completed in September 1944; this brought the total number of Blenheims in Finnish service to 97 (75 Mk Is and 22 Mk IVs). The Finns also received 20 half-completed ex-Yugoslavian Mk IV Blenheims captured by Germany, together with manufacturing tools, production equipment, and a huge variety of spare parts, although some of these had been damaged or otherwise destroyed through sabotage. Yugoslavia had ceased production of the Mk I and commenced a production run of Mk IVs just prior to the April 1941 invasion. The British-made Blenheims had RAF green interiors, RAF seat belts and instruments on imperial units, while Finnish-made Blenheims had medium grey interiors, Finnish-style seat belts and metric instruments.
The Finnish Blenheims flew 423 missions during the Winter War, and close to 3,000 missions during the Continuation War and Lapland War. Blenheim machine-gunners also shot down eight Soviet aircraft. Thirty-seven Blenheims were lost in combat during the wars. The Finnish Blenheims were divided on six series (&quot;sarja&quot;):

:Series I (BL-104..BL-121): 18 British-made Blenheim I bombers with doorless bomb bays. Arrived in 1938
:Series II (BL-146..BL-160): 15 Finnish-made Blenheim I bombers with deepened bomb bay doors. In service by 1941.
:Series III (BL-122..BL-133): 12 British-made Blenheim IV bombers (&quot;long-noses&quot;). Arrived in January 1940.
:Series IV (BL-134..BL-145): 12 British-made Blenheim I bombers. Arrived in February 1940.
:Series V (BL-161..BL-190): 30 Finnish-made Blenheim I bombers. In service by 1943.
:Series VI (BL-196..BL-205): 10 Finnish-made Blenheim IV bombers. In service by 1944.
:Series VII (BL-191..BL-195): six Finnish-made Blenheim I bombers, was cancelled in 1944.

Series I with doorless bomb bays could carry bomb load in the bomb bay and up to in wing cells. Series II, V and VI could carry load on bomb bay and on wing cells and fuselage racks. Series III and IV had the original RAF bomb bays and racks and could carry only load on bomb bay and on wing cells. The bomb bays, bomb bay doors and bomb racks of various series were modified on major overhauls to host bigger bombs.

After the war, Finland was prohibited from flying bomber aircraft by the Paris Peace Treaty, with Finland&#x27;s Blenheims being placed into storage in 1948. However, in 1951, five Blenheims were re-activated for use as target tugs, with the last flight of a Finnish Blenheim taking place on 20 May 1958. The usual nickname of Blenheim in the Finnish Air Force was &quot;Pelti-Heikki&quot; (&quot;Tin Henry&quot;).

==Surviving aircraft==
In Finland, the sole surviving original Blenheim in the world, a Mk IV registered as BL-200 of the Finnish Air Force, has been completely restored and is now on display at the Aviation Museum of Central Finland at Tikkakoski.

An airworthy Blenheim was rebuilt from a scrapped Bolingbroke over a 12-year period, only to crash at an airshow at Denham within a month of completion in 1987.

A replacement Bolingbroke Mk IVT was rebuilt to flying status over five years and painted to represent a Blenheim Mk IV in RAF wartime service. It began flying at air shows and exhibitions in the UK in May 1993, and was used in the 1995 film version of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot;. This aircraft crashed on landing at Duxford on 18 August 2003, but after extensive repair and conversion to the Mark I &quot;Short nose&quot; version by The Aircraft Restoration Company (ARC) at Duxford, was displayed to the public on 30 May 2014, and flew again, for 29 minutes, on 20 November 2014, following restoration at the Imperial War Museum Duxford, Cambridgeshire, England. The aircraft appeared in the 2017 Christopher Nolan film &quot;Dunkirk&quot;.

In summer 1996, a Bristol Blenheim Mk IVF was recovered from the sea, a few kilometres off Rethymnon, Crete. The aircraft belonged to No. 203 Squadron RAF and was downed by friendly fire on 28 April 1941. The Blenheim was moved to the Hellenic Air Force Museum for restoration.

The Kent Battle of Britain Museum in Hawkinge began a project to build a Blenheim IVF using the remains of four Bristol Bolingbrokes in 2018. The Aircraft Restoration Company (ARC) provided the left-over parts from its own Blenheim restoration.

The Royal Museum of the Armed Forces and Military History in Brussels exhibits a Bolingbroke painted as a No. 139 Squadron RAF Blenheim XD-A that crash landed in May 1940 in Belgium.

A Bolingbroke is being restored for museum display at Aerospace Bristol.

<doc id="81574" wikidata="Q275007" url="?curid=81574" title="9.5 mm film">
<text>9.5 mm film is an amateur film format introduced by Pathé in 1922 as part of the &quot;Pathé Baby&quot; amateur film system. It was conceived initially as an inexpensive format to provide copies of commercially made films to home users, although a simple camera was released shortly afterwards.

It became very popular in Europe over the next few decades and is still used by a small number of enthusiasts today. Over 300,000 projectors were produced and sold mainly in France and England, and many commercial features were available in the format.

==Format==
The format makes use of a single, central perforation (sprocket hole) between each pair of frames, as opposed to 8 mm film, which has perforations along one edge, and most other film formats, which have perforations on each side of the image. The single hole allowed more of the film to be used for the actual image, and in fact the image area is almost the same size as 16 mm film. The perforation in the film is invisible to viewers, as the intermittent shutter blocks the light as the film is pulled through the gate to the next frame.

The width of 9.5 mm was chosen because three strips of film could be made from one strip of unperforated 28 mm film. This was useful when duplicating films, because only one strip of 28 mm had to be processed. When discontinued in 1927, 9.5 mm strips were cut from 35 mm film.

The projection system also incorporated a way to save film on non-moving titles. A notch in the film was recognised by the projector, which would then project the second frame after it for 3 seconds. By this method, 3 seconds of screen time was available for 1 frame of film, rather than the 42 frames required if the film was projected at the normal rate (which was 14 fps at the very beginning, then it became 16 fps). The same principle was used by the &#x27;Agfa Family&#x27; system of Super 8 camera and projector in 1981 though to provide still images rather than titles.

==Pathéscope==

In Britain, 9.5 mm film, projectors and cameras were distributed by Pathéscope Ltd. During the years leading up to the Second World War, and for some years after the war, the gauge was used by enthusiasts who wanted to make home movies and to show commercially made films at home. Pathéscope produced a large number of home versions of significant films, including Mickey Mouse and Betty Boop cartoons, classic features such as Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Blackmail&quot;, and comedies by such well-known stars as Laurel and Hardy and Chaplin. A notable element in the Pathéscope catalogue was pre-war German mountain films by such directors as G. W. Pabst and Leni Riefenstahl. Classics such as Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Metropolis&quot;, &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot; and Dupont&#x27;s &quot;Vaudeville&quot; attracted many film collectors.

Film for home cinematography was usually supplied in rolls approximately 30 feet (9 m) long and enclosed in a &quot;charger&quot; or magazine, but spool loading (50 ft/15 m or 100 ft/30 m) was also available. Pre-war the most popular film was Ortho reversal costing only about 4 shillings and 6 pence per charger. After the war Panchromatic film became more usual, and around 1953 even Kodachrome I became available, though it took weeks to get it processed in Paris. Pathéscope Colour Film (actually made by Ferrania) was introduced in the 1950s. A number of cameras and projectors were produced, the more successful including the Pathéscope H camera and Gem projector. Optical sound was introduced for 9.5 mm in 1938, but efforts to produce a library of sound films were interrupted by the War. The optical track resulted in a rather square frame format for the picture.

After the war, the 9.5 mm gauge suffered strong competition from Kodak&#x27;s 8 mm film, which was introduced in 1932. Notwithstanding the far poorer resolution of the 8 mm frame, which could hold only about a quarter of the information of the 9.5 mm or 16 mm frame, 8 mm was taken up by a wider public, partly because of the commercial power of its sponsors and the much lower cost of Kodachrome processed in England. Pathéscope found itself struggling to hold its place in the market, and in 1959 there was a workers&#x27; buy-out and name change to Pathéscope (Great Britain) Ltd., with links to French Pathé being broken. The new company produced a well-made 9.5 mm Prince camera made in England by Smiths Industries and a low-powered Princess projector, but the gauge was already doomed as a popular format, and in 1960 the firm went into liquidation. Nevertheless, the gauge has been kept alive by a dedicated group of enthusiasts who have used methods such as re-perforating 16 mm film to provide continued supplies of material. The French Color City company provides modern 9.5 mm film stock. Several 9.5 clubs still exist in various countries and 9.5 festivals are held each year.

==Problems==
The central perforation of 9.5 mm film cannot be supported in the gate of camera or projector in the same way that 8 or 16 mm perforations are. Much damage was caused to 9.5 mm prints by early cheap toy projectors which lacked the customary sprocket drive requiring the pull-down claw to do all the work of transporting the film. Many very old 9.5 mm films are however still in good condition.

A further problem was that the film had to be passed through continuous processing machines slowly. The sprocket caused turbulence (the same effect as over agitation) to the developer immediately adjacent to the sprocket hole which resulted in that portion of the frame becoming overdeveloped (which manifested itself on the projected frame as over exposure). The filmstock is still process today (in the UK) and the central perforation is no longer a problem (since decades).

<doc id="81575" wikidata="Q208909" url="?curid=81575" title="Parlophone">
<text>Parlophone Records Limited (also known as Parlophone Records and Parlophone) is a record label founded in Germany in 1896 by the Carl Lindström Company as Parlophon. The British branch of the label was founded on 8 August 1923 as the Parlophone Company Limited (the Parlophone Co. Ltd.), which developed a reputation in the 1920s as a jazz record label. On 5 October 1926, the Columbia Graphophone Company acquired Parlophone&#x27;s business, name, logo, and release library, and merged with the Gramophone Company on 31 March 1931 to become Electric &amp; Musical Industries Limited (EMI). George Martin joined Parlophone in 1950 as assistant to Oscar Preuss (who had set up the London branch of the company in 1923), the label manager, taking over as manager in 1955. Martin produced and released a mix of recordings, including by comedian Peter Sellers, pianist Mrs Mills, and teen idol Adam Faith.

In 1962, Martin signed the Beatles, a beat group from Liverpool who earlier that year had been rejected by Decca Records. During the 1960s, when Cilla Black, Billy J. Kramer, the Fourmost, and the Hollies also signed, Parlophone became one of the world&#x27;s most famous labels. For several years, Parlophone claimed the best-selling UK single, &quot;She Loves You&quot;, and the best-selling UK album, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, both by the Beatles. The label placed seven singles at number 1 during 1964, when it claimed top spot on the UK Albums Chart for 40 weeks. Parlophone continued as a division of EMI until it was merged into the Gramophone Co. on 1 July 1965. On 1 July 1973, the Gramophone Co. was renamed EMI Records Limited.

On 28 September 2012, regulators approved Universal Music Group&#x27;s (UMG) planned acquisition of EMI on condition that its EMI Records group would be divested from the combined group. EMI Records Ltd included Parlophone (except the Beatles&#x27; catalogue) and other labels to be divested and were for a short time operated in a single entity known as the Parlophone Label Group (PLG), while UMG pended their sale. Warner Music Group (WMG) acquired Parlophone and [PLG] on 7 February 2013, making Parlophone their third flagship label alongside Warner and Atlantic. PLG was renamed Parlophone Records Limited in May 2013. Parlophone is the oldest of WMG&#x27;s &quot;flagship&quot; record labels.

==History==

===Early years===
Parlophone was founded &quot;Parlophon&quot; by Carl Lindström Company in 1896. The name Parlophon was used for gramophones before the company began making records of their own. The label&#x27;s ₤ trademark is a stylised blackletter &quot;L&quot; (formula_1) that stands for Lindström. (Its resemblance to the British pound sign &quot;£&quot; and the Italian lira sign &quot;₤&quot; is coincidental: both derive from the letter &quot;L&quot; used as an abbreviation for the Ancient Roman unit of measurement .) On 8 August 1923, the British branch of &quot;Parlophone&quot; (with the &quot;e&quot; added) was established, led by A&amp;R manager Oscar Preuss. In its early years, Parlophone established itself as a leading jazz label in Britain.

===EMI years and initial success===
In 1927, the Columbia Graphophone Company acquired a controlling interest in the Carl Lindström Company, including Parlophone. Parlophone became a subsidiary of Electric &amp; Musical Industries (EMI), after Columbia Graphophone merged with the Gramophone Company in 1931.

In 1950, Oscar Preuss hired producer George Martin as his assistant. When Preuss retired in 1955, Martin succeeded him as Parlophone&#x27;s manager. Parlophone specialized in mainly classical music, cast recordings, and regional British music, but Martin also expanded the reach into novelty and comedy records. One notable example is &quot;The Best of Sellers&quot;, a collection of sketches and comic songs by Peter Sellers undertaken in the guise of a variety of comic characters. It reached number three in the UK Albums Chart in 1958. Others include the albums of the comedy music double act Flanders and Swann. Musicians signed to the label included Humphrey Lyttelton and the Vipers Skiffle Group.

A consistently successful act for Parlophone was teen idol Adam Faith, who was signed to the label in 1959. The label gained significant popularity in 1962 when Martin signed Liverpool band the Beatles. Parlophone gained more attention after signing the Hollies, Ella Fitzgerald, and Gerry and the Pacemakers in the 1960s. Martin left EMI/Parlophone to form Associated Independent Recording (AIR) Studios in 1965. Norman Smith took over as Parlophone director, though EMI chairman Sir Joseph Lockwood unsuccessfully attempted to recruit Joe Meek for the job.

Parlophone became dormant (except for Beatles reissues) in 1973 when most of EMI&#x27;s heritage labels were phased out in favour of EMI Records, only to be revived in 1980. The first single released on the revived label was by British group The Cheaters (Parlophone – R6041). During the next decades the label signed Pet Shop Boys, Duran Duran, Roxette, Radiohead, Supergrass, Guy Berryman, the Chemical Brothers, Blur, Coldplay, Kylie Minogue, Damon Albarn, Conor Maynard, Gabrielle Aplin, and Gorillaz.

On 23 April 2008, Miles Leonard was confirmed as the label&#x27;s president.

===Acquisition by Warner Music Group===
On 28 September 2012, regulators approved Universal Music Group&#x27;s planned acquisition of Parlophone&#x27;s parent group EMI for £1.2 billion, subject to conditions imposed by the European Commission requiring that UMG sell off a number of labels, including Parlophone itself (aside from the Beatles&#x27; catalogue, which was kept by UMG and moved to Universal&#x27;s newly formed Calderstone Productions), Chrysalis (aside from Robbie Williams&#x27; catalogue), Ensign, Virgin Classics, EMI Classics, worldwide rights to Roulette Records (and its sublabels), and EMI&#x27;s operations in Portugal, Spain, France, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Poland. These labels and catalogues were operated independently from Universal as Parlophone Label Group until a buyer was found. UMG received several offers for PLG, including those from Island founder Chris Blackwell, Simon Fuller, a Sony/BMG consortium, Warner Music Group, and MacAndrews &amp; Forbes.

On 7 February 2013, it was confirmed that Warner Music Group would acquire Parlophone Label Group for US$765 million. The deal was approved in May 2013 by the European Union, which saw no concerns about the deal because of WMG&#x27;s smaller reach compared to the merged UMG and Sony. Warner Music closed the deal on 1 July. Parlophone Label Group was the old EMI Records label that included both the Parlophone and the eponymous EMI labels. The EMI trademark was retained by Universal (as Virgin EMI Records) while the &quot;old&quot; EMI Records became defunct and was renamed &quot;Parlophone Records Ltd.&quot;

Soon after acquiring Parlophone, WMG signed an agreement with IMPALA and the Merlin Network (two groups which opposed the EMI/Universal deal) to divest $200 million worth of catalogues to independent labels in order to help offset the consolidation triggered by the merger. In April 2016, the back catalogue of British rock band Radiohead, who had sued Parlophone and EMI over a dispute in music royalties, was transferred to XL Recordings.

WMG treats Parlophone as its third &quot;frontline&quot; label group alongside Atlantic and Warner. In the US, most of Parlophone&#x27;s artists are now distributed under Warner Records except Dinosaur Pile-Up, distributed by 300 Elektra Entertainment&#x27;s Roadrunner Records, Coldplay and Tinie Tempah, both distributed by Atlantic Records, and David Guetta, distributed by Atlantic&#x27;s electronic music imprint Big Beat Records.

==Roster==
Parlophone&#x27;s roster includes many popular music artists. Its contemporary His Master&#x27;s Voice was more of a classical music label and ceased issuing popular music recordings in 1967; later replaced by EMI Classics, which was absorbed into Warner Classics in 2013; English Columbia was replaced by the EMI pop label. Parlophone also operates Regal, a contemporary revival of the historic Columbia Graphophone budget/reissue label founded in 1914. The list records those who achieved notability.

===The Beatles===
The Beatles&#x27; albums in the U.K. up to &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; were issued on the Parlophone label. Subsequent releases – &quot;The Beatles&quot; (also known as the &quot;White Album&quot;), &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;, &quot;Abbey Road&quot; and &quot;Let It Be&quot; – were issued on the Beatles&#x27; own Apple record label, manufactured and distributed by EMI and bearing Parlophone catalogue numbers.

On 6 June 1962, producer George Martin signed the Beatles to Parlophone, in turn, making the Beatles&#x27; deal one of the cheapest by Parlophone. Despite the separation of Parlophone from EMI as a condition of EMI&#x27;s acquisition by UMG, Universal was allowed to keep the Beatles&#x27; recorded music catalogue, which is now managed by the subsidiary Calderstone Productions.

==Parlophone record labels==
The labels shown here include those used for 78s and LPs. The label design for 7-inch singles had the same standard template as several other EMI labels, with the large &quot;45&quot; insignia to the right. In recent years, design uniformity has relaxed from release to release.

<text>Southampton Football Club () is a professional football club based in Southampton, Hampshire, England. The club competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English football, after achieving promotion in the 2024 EFL Championship play-off final. Its home ground since 2001 has been St Mary&#x27;s Stadium, before which it was based at The Dell. The team play in red and white shirts. They have been nicknamed &quot;The Saints&quot; because of the club&#x27;s beginnings as a church football team at St Mary&#x27;s Church. Southampton shares a long-standing South Coast derby rivalry with Portsmouth, in part due to geographic proximity and both cities&#x27; respective maritime histories.

Founded in 1885, the club joined the Southern League as Southampton St. Mary&#x27;s in 1894, dropping the St. Mary&#x27;s from their name three years later. Southampton won the Southern League on six occasions and were beaten FA Cup finalists in 1900 and 1902, before being invited to become founder members of the Football League Third Division in 1920. They won promotion as Third Division South champions in 1921–22, remaining in the Second Division for 31 years until they were relegated in 1953. Crowned Third Division champions under the stewardship of Ted Bates in 1959–60, they were promoted into the First Division at the end of the 1965–66 campaign. They played top-flight football for eight seasons, but won the FA Cup as a Second Division team in 1976 with a 1–0 victory over Manchester United. Manager Lawrie McMenemy then took the club back into the top-flight with promotion in 1977–78.

Southampton were beaten finalists in the League Cup in 1979 and finished as runners-up in the First Division in 1983–84, three points behind Liverpool. The club were founder members of the Premier League in 1992 and reached another FA Cup final in 2003. Relegation ended their 27-year stay in the top-flight in 2005, and they were relegated down to the third tier in 2009. Southampton won the Football League Trophy in 2010 and won successive promotion from League One and the Championship in 2010–11 and 2011–12. After an 11-year stint in the top flight, during which they were EFL Cup runners-up in 2017, they were relegated in 2023. The club won the 2024 Championship play-off final and returned to the Premier League at the first attempt.

==History==

===Foundation and Southern League (1885–1920)===
Southampton were originally founded at St. Mary&#x27;s Church, on 21 November 1885 by members of the St. Mary&#x27;s Church of England Young Men&#x27;s Association.

St. Mary&#x27;s Y.M.A., as they were usually referred to in the local press, played most of their early games on The Common where games were frequently interrupted by pedestrians insistent on exercising their right to roam. More important matches, such as cup games, were played either at the County Cricket Ground in Northlands Road or the Antelope Cricket Ground in St Mary&#x27;s Road.

The club was originally known as St. Mary&#x27;s Young Men&#x27;s Association F.C. (usually abbreviated to &quot;St. Mary&#x27;s Y.M.A.&quot;) and then became simply St. Mary&#x27;s F.C. in 1887–88, before adopting the name Southampton St. Mary&#x27;s when the club joined the Southern League in 1894.

For the start of their League career, Saints signed several new players on professional contracts, including Charles Baker, Alf Littlehales and Lachie Thomson from Stoke and Fred Hollands from Millwall. After winning the Southern League title in 1896–97, the club became a limited company and was renamed Southampton F.C.

Southampton won the Southern League championship for three years running between 1897 and 1899 and again in 1901, 1903 and 1904. During this time, they moved to a newly built £10,000 stadium called The Dell, to the northwest of the city centre in 1898. Although they would spend the next 103 years there, the future was far from certain in those early days and the club had to rent the premises first before they could afford to buy the stadium in the early part of the 20th century. The club reached the first of their four FA Cup Finals in 1900. On that day, they went down 4–0 to Bury and two years later they would suffer a similar fate at the hands of Sheffield United as they were beaten 2–1 in a replay of the 1902 final. Reaching those finals gave Southampton recognition, even internationally: in 1909, an Athletic Bilbao representative who played for affiliated team Atlético Madrid purchased 50 Saints shirts during a trip to England, which were shared between the two squads. This early Southampton connection is the reason why the colours of both Spanish clubs became red and white, as they are nowadays.

===Joining the Football League (1920–1966)===
After World War I, Southampton joined the newly formed Football League Third Division in 1920 which split into South and North sections a year later. The 1921–22 season ended in triumph with promotion and marked the beginning of a 31-year stay in the Second Division.

The 1922–23 season was a unique &quot;Even Season&quot; – 14 wins, 14 draws and 14 defeats for 42 points, or one point per game. Goals for and against statistics were also equal and the team finished in mid-table.

In 1925 and 1927, they reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, losing 2–0 and 2–1 to Sheffield United and Arsenal respectively.

Southampton were briefly forced to switch home matches to the ground of their local rivals Portsmouth at Fratton Park during World War II when a bomb landed on The Dell pitch in November 1940, leaving an 18-foot crater which damaged an underground culvert and flooded the pitch.

Promotion was narrowly missed in 1947–48 when they finished in third place, a feat repeated the following season (despite having an eight-point lead with eight games to play) whilst in 1949–50 they narrowly missed out on promotion to second placed Sheffield United. In the 1948–49 and 1949–50 seasons, Charlie Wayman scored 56 goals, but relegation in 1953 sent Southampton sliding back into Division 3 (South).

It took until 1960 for Southampton to regain Second Division status with Derek Reeves plundering 39 of the champions&#x27; 106 league goals. On 27 April 1963, a crowd of 68,000 at Villa Park saw them lose 1–0 to Manchester United in the FA Cup semi-final.

===Reaching the First Division and cup win (1966–1977)===
In 1966, Ted Bates&#x27; team were promoted to the First Division as runners-up, with Martin Chivers scoring 30 of Saints&#x27; 85 league goals.

For the following campaign Ron Davies arrived to score 43 goals in his first season. Saints stayed among the elite for eight years, with the highest finishing position being seventh place in 1968–69 and again in 1970–71. These finishes were high enough for them to qualify for the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1969–70 (going out in Round 3 to Newcastle United) and its successor, the UEFA Cup in 1971–72, when they went out in the first round to Athletic Bilbao.

In December 1973, Bates stood down to be replaced by his assistant Lawrie McMenemy. The Saints were one of the first victims of the new three-down relegation system in 1974.

Under McMenemy&#x27;s management, Saints started to rebuild in the Second Division, capturing players such as Peter Osgood, Jim McCalliog, Jim Steele and Peter Rodrigues (captain) and in 1976, Southampton reached the FA Cup final, playing Manchester United at Wembley, and beat much-fancied United 1–0 with a goal from Bobby Stokes. The following season, they played in Europe again in the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, reaching Round 3 where they lost 2–3 on aggregate to Anderlecht.

===Return to First Division (1977–1992)===
In 1977–78, captained by Alan Ball, Saints finished runners-up in the Second Division (behind Bolton Wanderers) and returned to the First Division. They finished comfortably in 14th place in their first season back in the top flight. The following season they returned to Wembley in the final of the League Cup where they acquitted themselves well, losing 3–2 to Nottingham Forest.

In 1980, McMenemy made his biggest signing, capturing the European Footballer of the Year Kevin Keegan. Although Keegan&#x27;s Southampton career only lasted two years, Saints fielded an attractive side also containing Alan Ball, prolific goal-scorer Ted MacDougall, (who still holds the record for the largest number of goals in an FA Cup game – nine – for Bournemouth against Margate in an 11–0 win), MacDougall&#x27;s strike partner at Bournemouth and Norwich City, Phil Boyer, club stalwart Mick Channon and Charlie George and in 1980–81 they scored 76 goals, finishing in sixth place, then their highest league finish. The following season, Kevin Keegan helped lift the club to the top of the First Division. Southampton led the league for over two months, taking top spot on 30 January 1982 and staying there (apart from one week) until 3 April 1982. But in a disappointing end to the season, in which Keegan was hampered by a back injury, Southampton won only two of their last nine games and finished seventh. The winners of a wide-open title race were Keegan&#x27;s old club Liverpool, who were crowned champions on the final day of the season. Keegan scored 26 of Southampton&#x27;s 72 goals that season, but was then sold to Newcastle.

Southampton continued to progress under McMenemy&#x27;s stewardship, and with a team containing Peter Shilton (the England goalkeeper), Nick Holmes, David Armstrong, striker Steve Moran and quick winger Danny Wallace reached their highest ever league finish as runners-up in 1983–84 (three points behind the champions Liverpool) as well as reaching the semi-final of the FA Cup losing 1–0 to Everton at Highbury. McMenemy then added experienced midfielder Jimmy Case to his ranks.

They finished fifth the following year, but as a result of the Heysel Disaster all English clubs were banned from European competition: had it not been for this, then Southampton would have again qualified for the UEFA Cup.

McMenemy left at the end of the 1984–85 season to be succeeded by Chris Nicholl, who was sacked after six years in charge despite preserving the club&#x27;s top flight status. He was replaced by Ian Branfoot, who until the end of the 1990–91 season had been assistant manager to Steve Coppell at Crystal Palace. By this stage, a key player in the Southampton line-up was Guernsey-born attacking midfielder/striker Matthew Le Tissier, who broke into the first team in the 1986–87 season. He was voted PFA Young Player of the Year in 1990 and later made eight appearances for the England team – he finally retired in 2002 at the age of 33. Another exciting young player to break into the Southampton team just after Le Tissier was Alan Shearer, who at the age of 17 scored a hat-trick against Arsenal in a league match in April 1988. Shearer was a first team regular by 1990, and stayed with Southampton until July 1992, when he was sold to Blackburn Rovers for a national record of more than £3 million. He then became the most expensive footballer in the world when Blackburn sold him to Newcastle for £15 million in 1996. He also scored 30 times for England internationally.

===Southampton in the Premier League (1992–2005)===
Southampton were founding members of the Premier League in 1992–93, but spent most of the next ten seasons struggling against relegation. In 1995–96, Southampton finished 17th with 38 league points, avoiding relegation on goal difference. Two important wins during the final weeks of the season did much to ensure that Saints and not Manchester City would achieve Premiership survival. First came a 3–1 home win over eventual double winners Manchester United, then came a 1–0 away win over relegated Bolton Wanderers. Former Liverpool and Rangers manager Graeme Souness, was brought in, signing foreign players such as Egil Østenstad and Eyal Berkovic. The highlight of the season was a 6–3 win over Manchester United at The Dell in October, when both his signings scored twice. Souness resigned after just one season in charge, being replaced by Dave Jones who had won promotion to Division One with Stockport County as well as reaching the League Cup semi-finals.

In 1998–99, they were rooted to the bottom of the table for much of the first half of the season but again avoided relegation on the last day of the season after a late run of good results, helped by the intervention of Latvian Marian Pahars and old hero Le Tissier (The so-called &quot;Great Escape&quot;). In 1999, Southampton were given the go-ahead to build a new 32,000-seat stadium in the St Mary&#x27;s area of the city, having been playing in the Dell since 1898. The stadium had been converted to an all-seater format earlier in the decade, but had a capacity of less than 16,000 and was unsuitable for further expansion.

During the 1999–2000 season, Dave Jones quit as Southampton manager to concentrate on a court case after he was accused of abusing children at the children&#x27;s home where he had worked during the 1980s. The accusations were later proved to be groundless, but it was too late to save Jones&#x27; career as Southampton manager and he was succeeded by ex-England manager Glenn Hoddle. Hoddle helped keep Southampton well clear of the Premier League drop zone but having received an offer he moved to Tottenham Hotspur just before the end of the 2000–01 season. He was replaced by first-team coach Stuart Gray, who oversaw the relocation to the St Mary&#x27;s Stadium for the 2001–02 season. At the end of the 2000–01 season, in the last competitive match at The Dell, Matthew Le Tissier came on late to score the last ever league goal at the old stadium with a half volley on the turn in a 3–2 win against Arsenal. Gray was sacked after a poor start to the following season, and he was replaced by ex-Coventry City manager Gordon Strachan, who steered Southampton to safety and a secure 11th-place finish.

In 2002–03, Southampton finished eighth in the league and finished runners-up in the FA Cup to Arsenal (after losing 1–0 at the Millennium Stadium), thanks in no small part to the metamorphosis of James Beattie, who fired home 24 goals, 23 in the league. Strachan resigned in March 2004 and within eight months, two managers – Paul Sturrock and Steve Wigley – had come and gone. Chairman Rupert Lowe risked the ire of Saints fans when he appointed Harry Redknapp as manager on 8 December 2004, just after his resignation at South Coast rivals Portsmouth. He brought in a number of new signings, including his son Jamie in the attempt to survive relegation. Southampton were relegated from the Premier League on the last day of the season, ending 27 successive seasons of top flight football for the club. Their relegation was ironically confirmed by a 2–1 home defeat to Manchester United, who had been on the receiving end of many upsets by Southampton over the years, namely in the 1976 FA Cup final and since then on a number of occasions in the league, as well as inflicting a heavy defeat on them in a November 1986 League Cup tie which cost United manager Ron Atkinson his job.

Lowe and Southampton continued to make headlines after former England Rugby World Cup-winning coach Sir Clive Woodward joined the club—eventually being appointed technical director in June 2005.

===Outside the top flight (2005–2012)===

In November 2005, manager Harry Redknapp resigned to rejoin Portsmouth, and was replaced by George Burley. Rupert Lowe resigned as chairman in June 2006, and Jersey-based businessman Michael Wilde, who had become the club&#x27;s major shareholder assumed the post. Following a club record £6 million being spent on transfers, Polish strikers Grzegorz Rasiak and Marek Saganowski performed well and the season saw the introduction of 17-year-old left-back Gareth Bale. Southampton finished in sixth place and lost the play-off semi-final to Derby County on penalties.

The board sought new investment in the club, and in February 2007, Wilde stepped down as chairman to be replaced by local businessman Leon Crouch as &quot;Acting chairman&quot;, a role Crouch retained until 21 July 2007. In the 2007–08 season, George Burley said that players such as Bale and Kenwyne Jones had to be sold to stop the club going into administration and that failing to achieve promotion had put the club in serious financial difficulty. Burley left the club in January 2008 to take over as Scotland manager and was replaced by Nigel Pearson who saved the club from relegation on the final day.

In July 2008, all the board members except one resigned, allowing Lowe and Wilde to return: Wilde as chairman of Southampton FC and Rupert Lowe as chairman of Southampton Leisure Holdings plc. Although Pearson kept the team up, the board did not renew his contract due to financial constraints, and the relatively unknown Dutchman Jan Poortvliet was appointed manager. Financial troubles continued to mount, resulting in more players being sold or loaned out and parts of St Mary&#x27;s were closed off to reduce costs. In January 2009, Poortvliet resigned with the club one place from bottom of the Championship, with Mark Wotte taking over managerial duties.

In April 2009, Southampton&#x27;s parent company was placed in administration. A 10-point penalty was imposed, but as the team was already being relegated due to finishing second from bottom of the Football League Championship this points deduction had to apply to the 2009–10 season. By the end of May, the club was unable to meet its staff wages and asked employees to work unpaid as a gesture of goodwill. The administrator warned that the club faced imminent bankruptcy unless a buyer was found. In June, administrator Mark Fry confirmed negotiations with two groups of investors, followed by confirmation that the club had been sold to an overseas buyer &quot;owned and controlled by Markus Liebherr&quot;. Italian businessman Nicola Cortese was brought in by Liebherr to look after the club&#x27;s business interests on his behalf. In July 2009, with the club in the control of the new owner, Wotte was sacked as head coach and Alan Pardew was appointed as the new first team manager. The Saints made their first big signing under Liebherr, striker Rickie Lambert, who was purchased on 10 August from League One side Bristol Rovers.

Southampton started the 2009–10 season in League One, in the third tier of English football for the first time in 50 years and with −10 points. In March 2010, Southampton won their first trophy since 1976 when they defeated Carlisle United 4–1 at Wembley to claim the Football League Trophy. Southampton finished the season in seventh place, seven points from the last play-off position.

A new home shirt was unveiled on 10 June 2010, in celebration of the club&#x27;s 125th anniversary. The design was based on the original St. Mary&#x27;s Y.M.A. kit used in 1885; it featured the new anniversary crest and was without a sponsor&#x27;s logo. On 11 August, it was announced that Liebherr had died; however, the club&#x27;s future had been assured and planned for before his death. Pardew was dismissed in August and Nigel Adkins joined from Scunthorpe United as his replacement. The club was promoted to the Championship in May 2011 as runners-up to Brighton &amp; Hove Albion.

Returning to the Championship for the 2011–12 season, Southampton made their best start to a season for 75 years with a winning run at St. Mary&#x27;s of 13 league games, setting a new club record and going top of the league. In April 2012, Southampton achieved promotion to the Premier League as runners-up to Reading. The final game of the season set a record attendance at St Mary&#x27;s Stadium of 32,363. Lambert finished the season as the Championship&#x27;s top goalscorer with 27 league goals, his third &quot;Golden Boot&quot; in four seasons. He also won the &quot;Championship Player of the Year&quot; award. As a result, they became the second team within a year to achieve back-to-back promotions, a feat that Norwich City had achieved one year before.

===Return to the Premier League, relegation, and subsequent promotion (2012–present)===
Southampton returned to the Premier League for season 2012–13 initially under Nigel Adkins. Substantial sums were spent to strengthen the playing squad, but early in the season, Adkins was replaced by Argentine coach Mauricio Pochettino. Southampton finished the season in 14th place, and next season in eighth.
At the end of the 2013–14 season, Pochettino departed the club for Tottenham. The club subsequently appointed Ronald Koeman as his replacement on a three-year contract, and made several high-profile sales over the summer. In the final game of the 2014–15 season, a 6–1 victory against Aston Villa, Sadio Mané scored three goals in the space of 176 seconds, the fastest hat-trick in the history of the Premier League. The club finished seventh, then their highest ever Premier League rank, therefore qualifying for the 2015–16 UEFA Europa League. After defeating Vitesse, the Saints were eliminated in the play-off by Midtjylland. The following season, Southampton once again set new records for the club at the end of the season, finishing in sixth place. They once again qualified for the Europa League, although this time immediately entered the group stages, as opposed to the play-off rounds.

In June 2016, Koeman left Southampton to join Everton and Claude Puel replaced him on a three-year contract. The club were eliminated in the group stage of the Europa League but were more successful in the EFL Cup, where they lost 3–2 in the final to Manchester United. The club ended the 2016–17 season in eighth. During the summer, Puel was replaced as manager by Argentine coach Mauricio Pellegrino, previously of Alavés. In mid-season, the club sold Dutch defender Virgil van Dijk to Liverpool for an estimated £75 million, Southampton&#x27;s record sale and a world record for his position. Pellegrino was sacked in March 2018 with the team one point above the relegation zone, and his replacement, former player, Mark Hughes, guided the club to a 17th-place finish, avoiding relegation on the last day of the season. Hughes signed a new contract at the end of the season but a poor start to the following season led to him being sacked in December with the team in 18th place. He was replaced with former RB Leipzig boss Ralph Hasenhüttl, who steered the club away from relegation to finish 16th.

In August 2017, Southampton Football Club confirmed that the Chinese businessman Gao Jisheng had completed a multimillion-pound takeover of the club, acquiring an 80% stake for around £210m after successfully passing the relevant checks, including the Premier League&#x27;s owners and directors test. The deal followed more than 12 months of talks between the Gao family and the south coast club. The investment was made personally by Gao and his daughter Nelly as opposed to being sanctioned through Lander Sports, as originally mooted. Hangzhou-based Lander is the family&#x27;s business arm, which develops, constructs and manages sports sites.

Southampton suffered their worst ever defeat on 25 October 2019, losing 9–0 to Leicester City at home, this would later be replicated on 2 February 2021 against Manchester United at Old Trafford in the following campaign, albeit under different circumstances. It is tied with Ipswich Town&#x27;s defeat by Manchester United in 1995 as the biggest defeat since the Premier League&#x27;s inception. Following universal backlash toward the team&#x27;s performance, the players and coaching staff refused their wages from the match and instead donated them to the Saints Foundation. On 9 April 2020, Southampton became the first Premier League club to defer players&#x27; salaries, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite a poor start that saw them in the relegation zone as late as November, Southampton improved greatly as the season went on, ending the year with a seven-game unbeaten streak to finish 11th in the league. Their final tally of 52 points was the team&#x27;s highest total since 2015–16.

The club&#x27;s good run continued in the 2020–21 season with the Saints sitting in third after 13 games. The team also had a successful run in the FA Cup where they reached the semi-finals, losing to eventual winners Leicester City. In November, Southampton briefly led the Premier League table. However, despite the outstanding start to the season, a mid-season loss of form and an accumulation of injuries which decimated the senior squad ranks, due in part to the unavailability of much of the club&#x27;s training facilities resulting from the restrictions imposed during the second lockdown in England. As a consequence of this, Hasenhüttl was forced to field many of the club&#x27;s youth players in an attempt to fill in the gaps in his senior squad. After an impressive run during the first half of the season, Southampton would eventually finish in 15th place. In January 2022, Gao sold his 80% stake to Sport Republic, a group financed by Serbian Dragan Šolak for £100m. Despite most pundits predicting them to be relegated at the start of the season, Southampton finished the 2021–22 season in 15th place for the second consecutive year.

In November 2022, it was announced Southampton had parted company with manager Ralph Hasenhüttl after four years, to be replaced by Nathan Jones. On 12 February 2023, Jones was sacked following a disappointing run of results during which the Saints lost seven out of eight league matches, leaving them bottom of the Premier League table. After having served as caretaker manager in a 1–0 victory over Chelsea, Rubén Sellés, who had joined Southampton as first-team lead coach in June 2022, was announced as Jones&#x27;s replacement on 24 February on a contract until the end of the 2022–23 season. Sellés was unable to save the Saints&#x27; season, and the team were officially relegated on 13 May, following a 2–0 home loss to Fulham. On 24 May 2023, Southampton confirmed that they would not renew the contract of Sellés when it expired at the end of the season.

On 21 June 2023, the club appointed Russell Martin as manager on a three-year contract. Southampton returned to the Premier League at the first attempt, defeating Leeds United in the play-off final. On 15 December 2024, Martin was sacked as Southampton sat 20th in the Premier League table with only 5 points after 16 games following a 5–0 defeat at home by Tottenham Hotspur. He was replaced in the interim by Simon Rusk, the Southampton U-21s head coach. Six days later, Ivan Jurić was appointed the next manager on an 18-month deal.

==Club identity==

===Crest===
Originally, the club used the same crest as the one used by the city itself. However, in 1974 a competition was run for fans to design a new one.

The winning design, designed by Rolland Parris, was used for around 20 years, before being modified slightly by Southampton design agency The Graphics Workshop in the 1990s for copyright reasons.

From top-to-bottom, the halo is a reference to the nickname &quot;Saints&quot;, the ball to the nature of the club, the scarf to the fans and the team colours. The tree represents the nearby New Forest and Southampton Common, with the water representing Southampton&#x27;s connections with the rivers, seas and oceans. Below that is a white rose – the symbol of the city which is also present on the city coat of arms. In the mid-1990s the ball was changed from a vintage style ball (such as those used in the 1960s) to the current ball with black and white panels, for copyright reasons.

On 13 May 2010, the official crest for the 125th anniversary was released: &quot;The black outline and halo feature will now appear in gold, whilst the all important years 1885 and 2010 are scripted either side of the shield, with the figure 125 replacing the ball&quot;. The badge was used on Southampton&#x27;s shirts for the 2010–11 season.

===Anthem===
The Saints&#x27; anthem is the popular sports tune &quot;When the Saints Go Marching In&quot;, and since the club&#x27;s official nickname is &quot;the Saints&quot;, they are one of only a few teams who do not change the original lyric.

===Kit manufacturers and sponsors===
Thirteen companies have sponsored the players&#x27; shirts since shirt advertising was permitted in English football. The first company to do so was photocopier manufacturer Rank Xerox which sponsored the club for three years from 1980. Other sponsors have been Air Florida (1983), Draper Tools (1984–93), Dimplex (1993–95), Sanderson (1995–99), Friends Provident (1999–2006), Flybe (2006–10), aap3 (2011–14), Veho (2014–16), Virgin Media (2016–19), LD Sports (2019–20), and Sportsbet.io (2020–24). Since 2024, the shirt sponsor is Rollbit. In addition, Virgin Media was Southampton&#x27;s sleeve sponsor from 2017 to 2022. JD Sports was the sleeve sponsor for the 2022–23 season. Mairon Freight UK was the sleeve sponsor for the 2023–24 season. Since 2024, the sleeve sponsor is P&amp;O Cruises.

Since 2024, Southampton&#x27;s kits have been manufactured by Puma. Previous manufacturers have included Umbro (1974–76, 2008–13), Admiral (1976–80, 1991–93), Patrick (1980–87), Hummel (1987–91, 2021–24), Pony (1993–99), Adidas (2013–14, 2015–16) and Under Armour (2016–21). From 1999 to 2008, and in 2014–15, the club used its own brand, Saints.

==Stadium and training facilities==

The club&#x27;s first home ground was the Antelope Ground from 1887 to 1896. Followed by the County Cricket Ground from 1896 to 1898.

From 1898 to 2001, Southampton played their home games at The Dell. The purpose-built stadium was redeveloped a number of times through its 103-year history, with two of the stands being completely rebuilt after fires and in 1950 it became the first ground in England to have permanent floodlighting installed. Following the Taylor report, The Dell was converted to an all-seater stadium and, with a capacity of approximately 15,000, became the smallest ground in England&#x27;s top-flight, precipitating a move to a new home.

St Mary&#x27;s Stadium has been home to the Saints since August 2001. It has a capacity of 32,689 and is one of only a handful of stadia in Europe to meet UEFA&#x27;s Four Star criteria. The stadium has also been host to a number of international games. The ground&#x27;s record attendance is 32,363, set in a game between Southampton and Coventry City in April 2012.

The club&#x27;s training facilities, Staplewood Campus, are located in Marchwood on the edge of the New Forest. The current facilities were opened in November 2014, at a cost of circa £40m. The main building was named after the club&#x27;s late owner, Markus Liebherr.

For the 2012–13 season, until the end of the 2013–14 season, the club agreed a deal with Eastleigh, then of the Conference South, for the use of their stadium, Ten Acres, for The Saints&#x27; U21 team fixtures. This continued a partnership with Eastleigh that had lasted for nearly a decade. This partnership, though, ended and Southampton&#x27;s youth teams continued to play at Staplewood and St. Mary&#x27;s until the 2019–20 season when some U23 cup games were to be played at Totton&#x27;s Testwood Stadium, where Southampton Women had played their league home matches. 

==Rivalries==
The South Coast Derby is the name given to matches between the Saints and their fierce nearby rivals, Portsmouth, from the city of the same name, 19 miles (31 km) from Southampton. The south coast derbies are also referred to as the Hampshire derby. Including Southern League games, there have been 71 games between the two clubs, with Southampton winning 35 and Portsmouth 21.

==Bob Higgins historic sexual abuse==
Southampton became involved in the United Kingdom football sexual abuse scandal in December 2016 when several former Southampton teenage trainees told the BBC about inappropriate incidents in the 1980s involving a former football coach who was later revealed to be Bob Higgins. Higgins was dismissed by Southampton in 1989 after the allegations were made against him, and in 1991 he was charged with six counts of indecent assault against young boys he had been coaching; at the trial at Southampton Crown Court he was acquitted on the direction of the judge when the prosecution offered no evidence. Higgins then worked as a youth coach at Peterborough United in the mid-1990s,&lt;ref name=&quot;James/Morris-05Dec2016&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and was investigated as part of a 1997 Channel 4 &quot;Dispatches&quot; investigation. After two further court cases, Higgins was found guilty in 2019 of indecent assault, at Bournemouth Crown Court, and sentenced to 24 years in prison.

The FA&#x27;s Sheldon Review, published in March 2021, identified failures to act adequately on complaints or rumours of sexual abuse at clubs including Southampton. In November 2021, a report by the children&#x27;s charity Barnardo&#x27;s criticised Southampton for missing opportunities to prevent Higgins from abusing schoolboy footballers: &quot;adults in Southampton Football Club during the time Higgins worked for them or on their behalf did not consider the welfare and wellbeing of the boys involved with the club as their prime consideration.&quot; It said the damage caused was &quot;incalculable&quot; and &quot;devastating&quot;. Southampton issued a deep apology, admitting it had &quot;completely failed to protect so many young people from suffering abuse over a long period of time&quot;.

<text>Spider silk is a protein fibre or silk spun by spiders. Spiders use silk to make webs or other structures that function as adhesive traps to catch prey, to entangle and restrain prey before biting, to transmit tactile information, or as nests or cocoons to protect their offspring. They can use the silk to suspend themselves from height, to float through the air, or to glide away from predators. Most spiders vary the thickness and adhesiveness of their silk according to its use.

In some cases, spiders may use silk as a food source. While methods have been developed to collect silk from a spider by force, gathering silk from many spiders is more difficult than from silk-spinning organisms such as silkworms.

All spiders produce silk, although some spiders do not make webs. Silk is tied to courtship and mating. Silk produced by females provides a transmission channel for male vibratory courtship signals, while webs and draglines provide a substrate for female sex pheromones. Observations of male spiders producing silk during sexual interactions are common across widespread taxa. The function of male-produced silk in mating has received little study.

==Properties==

===Structural===
Silks have a hierarchical structure. The primary structure is the amino acid sequence of its proteins (spidroin), mainly consisting of highly repetitive glycine and alanine blocks, which is why silks are often referred to as a block co-polymer. On a secondary level, the short side-chained alanine is mainly found in the crystalline domains (beta sheets) of the nanofibril. Glycine is mostly found in the so-called amorphous matrix consisting of helical and beta turn structures. The interplay between the hard crystalline segments and the strained elastic semi-amorphous regions gives spider silk its extraordinary properties. Various compounds other than protein are used to enhance the fibre&#x27;s properties. Pyrrolidine has hygroscopic properties that keep the silk moist while warding off ant invasion. It occurs in high concentration in glue threads. Potassium hydrogen phosphate releases hydrogen ions in aqueous solution, resulting in a pH of about 4, making the silk acidic and thus protecting it from fungi and bacteria that would otherwise digest the protein. Potassium nitrate is believed to prevent the protein from denaturing in the acidic milieu.

Termonia introduced this first basic model of silk in 1994. He suggested crystallites embedded in an amorphous matrix interlinked with hydrogen bonds. Refinements to this model include: semi-crystalline regions were found as well as a fibrillar skin core model suggested for spider silk, later visualised by AFM and TEM. Sizes of the nanofibrillar structure and the crystalline and semi-crystalline regions were revealed by neutron scattering.

The fibres&#x27; microstructural information and macroscopic mechanical properties are related. Ordered regions (i) mainly reorient by deformation for low-stretched fibres and (ii) the fraction of ordered regions increases progressively for higher fibre stretching.

===Mechanical===
Each spider and each type of silk has a set of mechanical properties optimised for their biological function.

Most silks, in particular dragline silk, have exceptional mechanical properties. They exhibit a unique combination of high tensile strength and extensibility (ductility). This enables a silk fibre to absorb a large amount of energy before breaking (toughness, the area under a stress-strain curve).
Strength and toughness are distinct quantities. Weight for weight, silk is stronger than steel, but not as strong as Kevlar. Spider silk is, however, tougher than both.

The variability of spider silk fibre mechanical properties is related to their degree of molecular alignment. Mechanical properties also depend on ambient conditions, i.e. humidity and temperature.

==== Young&#x27;s modulus ====
Young&#x27;s modulus is the resistance to deformation elastically along the tensile force direction. Unlike steel or Kevlar which are stiff, spider silk is ductile and elastic, having lower Young&#x27;s modulus. According to Spider Silkome Database, &quot;Ariadna lateralis&quot; silk has the highest Young&#x27;s modulus with 37 GPa, compared to 208 GPa for steel and 112 GPa for Kevlar.

====Tensile strength====
A dragline silk&#x27;s tensile strength is comparable to that of high-grade alloy steel (450−2000 MPa), and about half as strong as aramid filaments, such as Twaron or Kevlar (3000 MPa). According to Spider Silkome Database, &quot;Clubiona vigil&quot; silk has the highest tensile strength.

====Density====
Consisting of mainly protein, silks are about a sixth of the density of steel (1.3 g/cm3). As a result, a strand long enough to circle the Earth would weigh about . (Spider dragline silk has a tensile strength of roughly 1.3 GPa. The tensile strength listed for steel might be slightly highere.g. 1.65 GPa, but spider silk is a much less dense material, so that a given weight of spider silk is five times as strong as the same weight of steel.)

====Energy density====
The energy density of dragline spider silk is roughly .

====Ductility====
Silks are ductile, with some able to stretch up to five times their relaxed length without breaking.

====Toughness====
The combination of strength and ductility gives dragline silks a high toughness (or work to fracture), which &quot;equals that of commercial polyaramid (aromatic nylon) filaments, which themselves are benchmarks of modern polymer fibre technology&quot;. According to Spider Silkome Database, &quot;Araneus ishisawai&quot; silk is the toughest.

==== Elongation at break ====
Elongation at break compares initial object length to final length at break. According to Spider Silkome Database, &quot;Caerostris darwini&quot; silk has the highest strain at break for any spider silk, breaking at 65% extension.

====Temperature====
While unlikely to be relevant in nature, dragline silks can hold their strength below -40 °C (-40 °F) and up to 220 °C (428 °F). As occurs in many materials, spider silk fibres undergo a glass transition. The glass-transition temperature depends on humidity, as water is a plasticiser for spider silk.

====Supercontraction====
When exposed to water, dragline silks undergo supercontraction, shrinking up to 50% in length and behaving like a weak rubber under tension. Many hypotheses have attempted to explain its use in nature, most popularly to re-tension webs built in the night using the morning dew.

====Highest-performance====
The toughest known spider silk is produced by the species Darwin&#x27;s bark spider (&quot;Caerostris darwini&quot;): &quot;The toughness of forcibly silked fibers averages 350 MJ/m3, with some samples reaching 520 MJ/m3. Thus, &quot;C. darwini&quot; silk is more than twice as tough as any previously described silk and over 10 times tougher than Kevlar&quot;.

===Adhesive===
Silk fibre is a two-compound secretion, spun into patterns (called &quot;attachment discs&quot;) using a minimum of silk substrate. The pyriform threads polymerise under ambient conditions, become functional immediately, and are usable indefinitely, remaining biodegradable, versatile and compatible with other materials in the environment. The adhesive and durability properties of the attachment disc are controlled by functions within the spinnerets. Some adhesive properties of the silk resemble glue, consisting of microfibrils and lipid enclosures.

== Uses ==
All spiders produce silks, and a single spider can produce up to seven different types of silk for different uses. This is in contrast to insect silks, where an individual usually only produces a single type. Spiders use silks in many ways, in accord with the silk&#x27;s properties. As spiders have evolved, so has their silks&#x27; complexity and uses, for example from primitive tube webs 300–400 million years ago to complex orb webs 110 million years ago.

== Silk types ==
Meeting the specification for all these ecological uses requires different types of silk presenting different properties, as either a fibre, a structure of fibres, or a globule. These types include glues and fibres. Some types of fibres are used for structural support, others for protective structures. Some can absorb energy effectively, whereas others transmit vibration efficiently. These silk types are produced in different glands; so the silk from a particular gland can be linked to its use.

Many species have different glands to produce silk with different properties for different purposes, including housing, web construction, defence, capturing and detaining prey, egg protection, and mobility (fine &quot;gossamer&quot; thread for ballooning, or for a strand allowing the spider to drop down as silk is extruded).
==Synthesis and fibre spinning==

Silk production differs in an important aspect from that of most other fibrous biomaterials. It is pulled on demand from a precursor out of specialised glands, rather than continuously grown like plant cell walls. 

The spinning process occurs when a fibre is pulled away from the body of a spider, whether by the spider&#x27;s legs, by the spider&#x27;s falling under its own weight, or by any other method. The term &quot;spinning&quot; is misleading because no rotation occurs. It comes from analogy to the textile spinning wheels. Silk production is a pultrusion, similar to extrusion, with the subtlety that the force is induced by pulling at the finished fibre rather than squeezing it out of a reservoir. The fibre is pulled through (possibly multiple) silk glands of multiple types.

===Silk gland===
The gland&#x27;s visible, or external, part is termed the spinneret. Depending on the complexity of the species, spiders have two to eight spinnerets, usually in pairs. Species have varying specialised glands, ranging from a sac with an opening at one end, to the complex, multiple-section ampullate glands of the golden silk orb-weavers.

Behind each spinneret on the surface of the spider lies a gland, a generalised form of which is shown in the figure.
;Gland characteristics

# The leftmost section is the secretory or tail section. The walls of this section are lined with cells that secrete proteins Spidroin I and Spidroin II, the main components of this spider&#x27;s dragline. These proteins are found in the form of droplets that gradually elongate to form long channels along the length of the final fibre, hypothesised to assist in preventing crack formation or self-healing.
# The ampulla (storage sac) is next. This stores and maintains the gel-like unspun silk dope. In addition, it secretes proteins that coat the surface of the final fibre.
# The funnel rapidly reduces the large diameter of the storage sac to the small diameter of the tapering duct.
# The final length is the tapering duct, the site of most of the fibre formation. This consists of a tapering tube with several tight sharp turns, a valve near the end includes a spigot from which the solid silk fibre emerges. The tube tapers hyperbolically, therefore the unspun silk is under constant elongational shear stress, an important factor in fibre formation. This section is lined with cells that exchange ions, reduce the dope pH from neutral to acidic, and remove water from the fibre. Collectively, the shear stress and the ion and pH changes induce the liquid silk dope to undergo a phase transition and condense into a solid protein fibre with high molecular organisation. The spigot at the end has lips that clamp around the fibre, controlling fibre diameter and further retaining water.
# Almost at the end is a valve. Though discovered some time ago, its precise purpose is still under discussion. It is believed to assist in restarting and rejoining broken fibres, acting much in the way of a helical pump, regulating the thickness of the fibre, and/or clamping the fibre as a spider falls upon it. The similarity of the silk worm&#x27;s silk press and the roles each of these valves play in the silk production in these two organisms are under discussion.

Throughout the process the silk appears to have a nematic texture, in a manner similar to a liquid crystal, arising in part due to the high protein concentration of silk dope (around 30% in terms of weight per volume). This allows the silk to flow through the duct as a liquid while maintaining molecular order.

As an example of a complex spinning field, the spinneret apparatus of an adult &quot;Araneus diadematus&quot; (garden cross spider) consists of many glands shown below. A similar gland architecture appears in the black widow spider.
* 500 pyriform glands for attachment points
* 4 ampullate glands for the web frame
* 300 aciniform glands for the outer lining of egg sacs, and for ensnaring prey
* 4 tubuliform glands for egg sac silk
* 4 aggregate glands for adhesive functions
* 2 coronate glands for the thread of adhesion lines
In the silk apparatus of the american genus Kaira, the two aggregate glands, unique so far in the whole Araneae order display an astounding microscopic structure with its giant cells pads secreting an allomone attractive for preys (male moths)

==Artificial synthesis==

To artificially synthesise spider silk into fibres, two broad tasks are required. These are synthesis of the feedstock (the unspun silk dope in spiders), and synthesis of the production conditions (the funnel, valve, tapering duct, and spigot). Few strategies have produced silk that can efficiently be synthesised into fibres.

===Feedstock===
The molecular structure of unspun silk is both complex and long. Though this endows the fibres with desirable properties, it also complicates replication. Various organisms have been used as a basis for attempts to replicate necessary protein components. These proteins must then be extracted, purified, and then spun before their properties can be tested.

===Geometry===
Spider silks with comparatively simple molecular structure need complex ducts to be able to form an effective fibre. Approaches:

====Syringe and needle====
Feedstock is forced through a hollow needle using a syringe.

Although cheap and easy to produce, gland shape and conditions are loosely approximated. Fibres created using this method may need encouragement to solidify by removing water from the fibre with chemicals such as (environmentally undesirable) methanol or acetone, and also may require later stretching of the fibre to achieve desirable properties.

====Superhydrophobic surfaces====
Placing a solution of spider silk on a superhydrophobic surface can generate sheets, particles, and nanowires of spider silk.

====Sheets====
Self-assembly of silk at standing liquid-gas interphases of a solution tough and strong sheets. These sheets are now explored for mimicking the basal membrane in tissue modeling.

====Microfluidics====
Microfluidics have the advantage of being controllable and able to test spin small volumes of unspun fibre, but setup and development costs are high. A patent has been granted and continuously spun fibres have achieved commercial use.

====Electrospinning====
Electrospinning is an old technique whereby a fluid is held in a container such that it flows out through capillary action. A conducting substrate is positioned below, and a difference in electrical potential is applied between the fluid and the substrate. The fluid is attracted to the substrate, and tiny fibres jump from their point of emission, the Taylor cone, to the substrate, drying as they travel. This method creates nano-scale fibres from silk dissected from organisms and regenerated silk fibroin.

=== Other shapes ===
Silk can be formed into other shapes and sizes such as spherical capsules for drug delivery, cell scaffolds and wound healing, textiles, cosmetics, coatings, and many others. Spider silk proteins can self-assemble on superhydrophobic surfaces into nanowires, as well as micron-sized circular sheets. Recombinant spider silk proteins can self-assemble at the liquid-air interface of a standing solution to form protein-permeable, strong and flexible nanomembranes that support cell proliferation. Potential applications include skin transplants, and supportive membranes in organ-on-a-chip. These nanomembranes have been used to create a static &quot;in-vitro&quot; model of a blood vessel.

=== Synthetic spider silk ===
Replicating the complex conditions required to produce comparable fibres has challenged research and early-stage manufacturing. Through genetic engineering, &quot;E. coli&quot; bacteria, yeasts, plants, silkworms, and animals other than silkworms have been used to produce spider silk-like proteins, which have different characteristics than those from a spider. Extrusion of protein fibres in an aqueous environment is known as &quot;wet-spinning&quot;. This process has produced silk fibres of diameters ranging from 10 to 60 μm, compared to diameters of 2.5–4 μm for natural spider silk. Artificial spider silks have fewer and simpler proteins than natural dragline silk, and consequently offer half the diameter, strength, and flexibility of natural dragline silk.

==== Research ====
* In March 2010, researchers from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science &amp; Technology succeeded in making spider silk directly using &quot;E. coli&quot; modified with certain genes of the spider &quot;Nephila clavipes&quot;. This approach eliminates the need to &quot;milk&quot; spiders.
* A 556 kDa spider silk protein was manufactured from 192 repeat motifs of the &quot;N. clavipes&quot; dragline spidroin, having similar mechanical characteristics as their natural counterparts, i.e., tensile strength (1.03 ± 0.11 GPa), modulus (13.7 ± 3.0 GPa), extensibility (18 ± 6%), and toughness (114 ± 51 MJ/m3).
* AMSilk developed spidroin using bacteria.
* Bolt Threads produced a recombinant spidroin using yeast, for use in apparel fibers and personal care. They produced the first commercial apparel products made of recombinant spider silk, trademarked Microsilk, demonstrated in ties and beanies.
* Kraig Biocraft Laboratories used research from the Universities of Wyoming and Notre Dame to create silkworms genetically altered to produce spider silk.
* Defunct Canadian biotechnology company Nexia produced spider silk protein in transgenic goats; the milk produced by the goats contained significant quantities of the protein, 1–2 grams of silk proteins per litre of milk. Attempts to spin the protein into a fibre similar to natural spider silk resulted in fibres with tenacities of 2–3 grams per denier. Nexia used wet spinning and squeezed the silk protein solution through small extrusion holes to simulate the spinneret, but this was not sufficient to replicate native spider silk properties.
* Spiber produced a synthetic spider silk (Q/QMONOS). In partnership with Goldwin, a ski parka made from this was in testing in 2016.
* Researchers from Japan&#x27;s RIKEN Center constructed an artificial gland that reproduced spider silk&#x27;s molecular structure. Precise microfluidic mechanisms directed proteins to self-assemble into functional fibers. The process used negative pressure to pull (rather than push) a spidroin solution through the device. The resulting fibers matched the hierarchical structure of natural fiber.

==Human uses==
The earliest recorded attempt to weave fabric from spider silk was in 1709 by François Xavier Bon who, using a process similar to creating silkworm silk, wove silk derived spider&#x27;s egg cocoons into stockings and gloves. Fifty years later Jesuit missionary invented a reeling device for harvesting spider silk directly from spiders, allowing it to be spun into threads. Neither Bon nor Termeyer were successful in producing commercially viable quantities.

The development of methods to mass-produce spider silk led to the manufacturing of military, medical, and consumer goods, such as ballistic armour, athletic footwear, personal care products, breast implant and catheter coatings, mechanical insulin pumps, fashion clothing, and outerwear. However, due to the difficulties in extracting and processing, the largest known piece of cloth made of spider silk is an textile with a golden tint made in Madagascar in 2009. Eighty-two people worked for four years to collect over one million golden orb spiders and extract silk from them. In 2012, spider silk fibres were used to create a set of violin strings.

=== Medicine ===
Peasants in the southern Carpathian Mountains used to cut up tubes built by &quot;Atypus&quot; and cover wounds with the inner lining. It reportedly facilitated healing, and connected with the skin. This is believed to be due to the silk&#x27;s antiseptic properties, and because silk is rich in vitamin K, which can aid in clotting blood. &quot;N. clavipes&quot; silk was used in research concerning mammalian neuronal regeneration.

=== Science and technology ===
Spider silk has been used as a thread for crosshairs in optical instruments such as telescopes, microscopes, and telescopic rifle sights. In 2011, silk fibres were used to generate fine diffraction patterns over N-slit interferometric signals used in optical communications. Silk has been used to create biolenses that could be used in conjunction with lasers to create high-resolution images of the inside of the human body.

Silk has been used to suspend inertial confinement fusion targets during laser ignition, as it remains considerably elastic and has a high energy to break at temperatures as low as 10–20 K. In addition, it is made from &quot;light&quot; atomic number elements that emit no x-rays during irradiation that could preheat the target, limiting the pressure differential required for fusion.

<text>Bombardier Aviation, a division of Bombardier Inc., is headquartered in Dorval, Quebec, Canada. The company currently produces the Global and Challenger series of business jets. 

At its peak, Bombardier operated manufacturing plants in 27 countries and employed over 70,000 workers. However, under financial pressure, it significantly reduced its workforce and divested its entire commercial aircraft portfolio including the Q-Series regional turboprop, CRJ-Series of regional jets, and the C-Series narrowbody jet. 

== History ==
===Early activities===


Bombadier acquired the state-owned Canadair from the government of Canada in 1986 and restored it to profitability. Canadair had been nationalized in 1976.

In 1989, Bombardier acquired the near-bankrupt Short Brothers aircraft manufacturing company in Belfast, Northern Ireland. This was followed in 1990 by the acquisition of the bankrupt American company Learjet, a manufacturer of business jets headquartered in Wichita, Kansas. A third major aircraft manufacturer acquisition was the money-losing Boeing subsidiary, de Havilland Aircraft of Canada based in Toronto, Ontario, acquired in 1992. Canadair, Learjet and Short Brothers cost US$ 215 million to acquire and produced revenues of US$1.3 billion in 1990. The sales of Canadair commuter jets and airborne surveillance systems, Learjet business aircraft and Short Brothers C-23 Sherpa cargo planes were growing at that time.

The aerospace company accounted for over half of Bombardier Inc.&#x27;s revenue. By the start of the 2010s, its most popular aircraft included its Dash 8 Series 400, CRJ100/200/440, and CRJ700/900/1000 lines of regional airliners although the company was devoting most of its Research and Development budget to the newer CSeries. It also manufactured the Bombardier 415 amphibious water-bomber (in Dorval and North Bay), and the Global Express and the Challenger lines of business jets.

The CSeries, which Bombardier offered in several size versions, initially competed with the Airbus A318 and Airbus A319; the Boeing 737 Next Generation 737-600 and 737-700 models; and the Embraer 195. Bombardier claimed the CSeries would burn 20% less fuel per trip than these competitors, which would make it still about 8% more fuel efficient than the Boeing 737 MAX, which was introduced in 2017.

In 2008, the launch customer for the CSeries, Lufthansa, signed a letter of intent for up to 60 aircraft and 30 options. The Montreal manufacturing complex was redeveloped by Ghafari Associates to incorporate lean manufacturing for the CSeries.

===2010–2016===
On 24 March 2011, Shanghai-based Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) and Bombardier Inc. signed a framework agreement for a long-term strategic cooperation on commercial aircraft. The intention was to break the near-duopoly of Airbus and Boeing. Aircraft covered by the programme included the Bombardier CRJ-series, CSeries and Q-series; and the Comac ARJ21 and Comac C919. In January 2012, the firm began manufacturing simple structures, such as flight controls for the CRJ series, from its first facility in Africa, near Casablanca, Morocco. On 30 September 2013, it broke ground on its permanent facility, due to open late 2014. In October, a joint development deal between Bombardier and a South Korean consortium consisting of Korea Aerospace Industries and Korean Air Lines was revealed, to develop a 90-seater turboprop regional airliner, targeting a 2019 launch date.

In November 2012, Bombardier signed the largest deal in its history with Swiss business jet operator VistaJet for 56 Global series jets for a total value of $3.1 billion, including an option for an additional 86 jets, for a total transaction value of $7.8 billion. In April 2013, Canada&#x27;s Porter Airlines placed a conditional order for 12 CSeries aircraft, with options for another 18; this was conditional on jets being allowed to use Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport off downtown Toronto. In 2015, the Canadian Government announced that it would not approve the marine expansion of the runway required for the use of jets at the airport and the proposal was shelved.

In January 2014, 1,700 employees were cut from Bombardier Aerospace due to a 19 percent drop in orders in 2013. In July of that year, Bombardier reorganized itself in response to underperformance; President Guy Hachey retired and Bombardier Aerospace was split into three divisions: business aircraft; commercial aircraft and aerostructures; and engineering services, while 1,800 jobs were cut. In its 2014-year end statement, Bombardier Aerospace reported its employee count had reduced by 3,700, delivered 290 aircraft and held orders for 282 more; and also claimed &quot;strong long-term potential&quot;. On 29 October 2015, Bombardier announced a US$4.9-billion third-quarter loss and $3.2 billion writedown on the CSeries. It also cancelled its Learjet 85 program, taking another US$1.2-billion writedown and cancelling 64 outstanding orders. The firm&#x27;s debt reached approximately $9 billion, largely due to the CSeries, which had not recorded a single firm order since September 2014. Bombardier shares fell 17.4 per cent on that day. By 21 December 2015, the firm had 243 firm orders for the CSeries; a US$2.5 billion cash infusion – $1 billion from the provincial government plus a $1.5 billion investment from the &quot;Caisse de dépôts et placements du Québec&quot; – was keeping the parent company adequately funded.

On 17 February 2016, Bombardier announced its 2015 profits were $138 million before taking a $5.4 billion write-down; it also announced 7,000 jobs would be cut. After a long and expensive development, costing US$5.4 billion to date, including a US$3.2 billion writeoff, the small (110–125 seat) CS100 version of the CSeries received initial type certification from Transport Canada on 18 December 2015. At the time, the company had 243 firm orders and letters of intent and commitment for another 360. Most orders were for the CS300 model. The first CS100 was expected to be flying by mid-2016 in Lufthansa colours. &quot;Certification is a great thing, but 2016 is going to be critical for orders,&quot; analyst Chris Murray, a
Managing Director with Alta Corp, told Bloomberg Business. Fred Cromer, president of Bombardier&#x27;s commercial aircraft unit, hinted on 21 December 2015 that price cuts or other incentives may be offered to bolster sales (list price for the CS100 was US$71.8 million and for the CS300 US$82 million).

Intending to boost profit margins, Bombardier announced on 12 January 2016 that it would cancel deals with third party sales agent Tag Aeronautics, as well as cancelling 24 firm and 30 optional orders, aiming to later resell these aircraft without a sales agency fee. The CSeries was adversely hit by production delays and stiff competition in 2016. On 20 January, United Continental Holdings Inc. announced that it had ordered 40 Boeing 737-700s instead. Air Canada announced it would buy up to 75 CS300s, a larger variant, on 17 February 2016; prior to this, there had been no CSeries orders since 2014. The CSeries program was forecast to have positive cash flow after delivering approximately 200 aircraft. David Tyerman, an analyst with Canaccord Genuity, commented on the difficulty of winning orders and questioned how profitable the next CSeries order will be. According to Bjorn Fehrm of the aviation consulting firm Leeham Company, the first 15 CSeries built in 2016 each cost $60 million to make, but would sell for only $30 million.

Bombardier held negotiation with Delta Air Lines, the latter placing an order in April 2016 for 75 CS100 models with an option for 50 additional aircraft. At full list price, the deal would total US$5.6 billion; sources claimed that Delta had received a significant discount. Air Canada firmed up its tentative order for 45 CS300s with an option for another 30 in June 2016; it was reportedly valued at $3.8 billion, increasing to $6.3 billion if the option was exercised (based on the aircraft&#x27;s list price). The next day, Bombardier delivered the first CSeries jet to Swiss International Air Lines, the first operator to start flying them.

===Government subsidy controversies===

==== Embraer ====

Brazil and Canada engaged in an international, adjudicated trade dispute over government subsidies to domestic aircraft manufacturers in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The World Trade Organization decided that Brazil ran an illegal subsidy program, Proex, benefiting Brazilian manufacturer Embraer from at least 1999–2000; and that Canada illegally subsidized its indigenous regional airliner industry.

In late September 2017, the World Trade Organization announced that it would consider Brazil&#x27;s complaint filed in February, including allegations that the Canadian government unfairly subsidized the CSeries. Embraer claimed that the subsidies are an &quot;unsustainable practice that distorts the entire global market, harming competitors at the expense of Canadian taxpayers.&quot;

====2015–2017 government assistance====

On 29 October 2015, the Quebec government announced that it would invest US$1 billion (roughly CAD$1.3 billion) to protect jobs and the CSeries, the province buying a 49.5% interest in the limited partnership controlling the CSeries program. Bombardier had reportedly asked Ottawa for a repayable loan of $350 million, while the province expected the federal government to match its $1 billion loan in return for a near 50 percent stake in the CSeries program. Debts from the project had forced Bombardier to raise cash and seek aid in order to stay afloat. Both provincial and federal contributions came via repayable loans; independent economist Mark Milke claimed it is questionable whether they would be repaid, calling the bailout loans &quot;corporate welfare&quot; in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;.

Days after his swearing-in, on 10 November 2015, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stated Bombardier must make a &quot;strong business case&quot; for federal aid, agreeing that the firm exemplified important high-value manufacturing, but stated that such aid would be shaped by Canadians&#x27; best interests, not on &quot;emotion, politics or symbols&quot;. In April 2016, the federal government offered an aid package to Bombardier without disclosing the amount or conditions imposed; it reportedly rejected the offer. An unnamed source advised Reuters that negotiations were still underway. On 14 April 2016, Bombardier shares were at a six-month high over rumors that Delta had ordered CSeries jets. The firm continued to request a $1 billion aid package from the federal government.

In May 2016, the federal government reportedly offered a $1 billion aid package (in addition to the $1 billion subsidy offered by the Government of Quebec) with the condition of Bombardier ending its dual-class share structure which enables the Bombardier and Beaudoin families to control it despite a minority ownership. According to Bloomberg, the talks reached a standstill over this condition. The federal plan also recommended that the firm issue new shares to gain $1 billion in additional funding. The &quot;Toronto Star&quot; predicted that the government would bailout the firm as bankruptcy would lead to the loss of some 70,000 jobs as well as significant exports, which had totaled $34.2 billion in the previous five years. In May 2016, Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the aerospace sector is &quot;critically important&quot;. In February 2017, the federal government agreed to provide $372.5 million in interest-free repayable loans, to be issued in instalments over the following four years; one third was intended for the CSeries while the rest went to the Global 7000 business jet.

=== Airbus partnership ===

On 16 October 2017, Bombardier and Airbus announced a partnership on the CSeries program to expand in an estimated market of more than 6,000 new 100-150 seat aircraft over 20 years; in July 2018, Airbus acquired a 50.01% majority stake in the holding company for the program, Bombardier keeping 31% and Investissement Québec 19%. Under this deal, the CSeries is now marketed as the Airbus A220. Access to Airbus&#x27;s supply chain expertise was intended to save production costs while the headquarters and primary assembly line remain in Québec, with a second assembly line at the Airbus Mobile factory in Alabama, US. Airbus did not pay for its share, nor did it assume any debt. Airbus insisted that it had no plan to buy Bombardier&#x27;s stake in the program, remaining strategic partners after 2025; clauses allowed it to buy out Quebec&#x27;s share in 2023 and Bombardier&#x27;s seven years after the deal closes, though production is required to remain in Quebec until at least 2041. Bombardier CEO Alain Bellemare said the deal would raise sales: &quot;It brings certainty to the future of the program so it increases the level of confidence that the aircraft is there to stay. Combining the CSeries with Airbus&#x27;s global scale ... will take the CSeries program to new heights&quot;.

=== Divestment ===

On 8 November 2018, Viking Air parent Longview Aviation Capital Corp. acquired the Q400 program and the de Havilland brand from Bombardier. Viking had already bought the discontinued de Havilland Canada aircraft type certificates in 2006. At that point, Q400 sales were lower than rival ATR. Bombardier announced the sale was for $300 million and expected $250 million annual savings. The Q400 deal closed on 3 June 2019; the new holding company, De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Limited, inherited an order book of 51 Q400s. Also in late 2018, Bombardier sold its business jet training program to CAE Inc. for $645 million and announced 5,000 job cuts over 18 months across its 70,000 employees worldwide: 500 in Ontario, 2,500 in Quebec and 2,000 outside Canada.

Bombardier shifted focus from commercial to business aircraft, anticipating business jet shipments to increase from 135 in 2018 to 150-155 in 2019, and forecast revenues of $16.5 billion in 2018, rising to over $20 billion in 2020 with a free cash flow of $0.75-1 billion, mostly via the large Global 7500. Business Aircraft revenues were expected to increase from $5 billion for 2018 to $6.25 billion in 2019 and $8.5 billion in 2020 with 180 deliveries, including aftermarket within the 4,700 fleet doubling from the 28% captured in 2015. Aerostructures &amp; Engineering Services were expected to grow from $2 billion in 2018 to $2.25 billion in 2020. Airliner revenues were expected to shrink from $1.7 billion to $1.4 billion in 2019, halving losses to $125 million, with deliveries flat at 35 CRJs and Q400s; it was to be profitable with CRJs only in 2020.

On 2 May 2019, Bombardier&#x27;s aerospace division was renamed &quot;Bombardier Aviation&quot; following the divestment of the CSeries and Q400 programmes. On 25 June 2019, Bombardier agreed with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to sell the CRJ program, a deal was expected to close in early 2020 subject to regulatory approval. Mitsubishi will gain Bombardier&#x27;s global expertise in terms of engineering, certification, customer relations and support, boosting its SpaceJet (formerly MRJ) programme and enabling its production in North America. The deal includes two service centres in Canada and two in the US, as well as the CRJ&#x27;s type certificates. Bombardier retains the Mirabel assembly facility and produce the CRJ on behalf of Mitsubishi until the current order backlog is complete. In early May 2020, Mitsubishi confirmed that all conditions had been met. The transaction closed on 1 June. Bombardier&#x27;s CRJ-related service and support activities were transferred to a new Montreal-based company, MHI RJ Aviation Group.

On 31 October 2019, Bombardier announced the sale of its aerostructures activities and aftermarket services operations in Northern Ireland and Morocco, and its aerostructures maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facility in Dallas, to Spirit AeroSystems. The sale was expected to close in the first half of 2020 subject to regulatory approval. In September 2020 Spirit said &quot;there can be no assurances&quot; that conditions would be met by the 31 October deadline. A last-minute amendment reduced the amount of the cash consideration and adjusted the overall valuation, enabling the parties to set a closing date of 30 October.

On 12 February 2020, Bombardier sold its share in Airbus Canada Limited Partnership, the holding company for the A220 programme, for $591 million; Airbus now has a 75% share, with the remaining 25% owned by Investissement Québec. This sale marked Bombardier&#x27;s &quot;strategic exit&quot; from the commercial aviation sector.

Despite rumours that its business jet activities might be sold to Textron, parent company of Cessna, Beechcraft and Bell Helicopters, on 17 February it emerged that Bombardier had instead agreed to sell its rail division to Alstom and would focus exclusively on business aviation.

==Facilities==

Bombardier Aviation has several facilities.

===Facilities history===
Bombardier Aerospace once had manufacturing, engineering and services facilities in 27 countries. The production facilities are located in Canada, the United States, and Mexico.

On 3 May 2018, Bombardier announced the sale of its Toronto Downsview facility where it manufactures the Global business jet family and the Q400 regional turboprops, for $635 million, leased back for three to five years to maintain Q400 production, while leasing a site at Toronto Pearson International Airport to open a final assembly plant for the Global business jets.
On 2 May 2019, Bombardier announced that all of its aerospace assets would be consolidated into a &quot;single, streamlined and fully integrated business&quot;, resulting in the sale of its operations in Belfast and Morocco.

=== Current facilities ===

==== Canada ====
* Montreal Trudeau International Airport — Headquarters. Challenger 300 and 650 final assembly and flight test. Global family interior completion.
* Saint-Laurent, Quebec — Product Development Centre. Cockpit and aft fuselage manufacturing facility.

<doc id="81584" wikidata="Q2050326" url="?curid=81584" title="Northridge, Los Angeles">
<text>Northridge is a neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley region of the City of Los Angeles. The community is home to California State University, Northridge, and the Northridge Fashion Center.

Originally named Zelzah by settlers in 1908, the community was renamed North Los Angeles in 1929 but the appellation sometimes caused confusion between North Hollywood and Los Angeles. In 1938, civic leader Carl S. Dentzel decided to rename the community to Northridge Village, which morphed into modern-day Northridge.

The Northridge area can trace its history back to the Tongva people and later to Spanish explorers. It was sold by the Mexican governor Pío Pico to Eulogio de Celis, whose heirs divided it for resale.

==Population==
The 2000 U.S. census counted 57,561 residents in the Northridge neighborhood—or , among the lowest population densities for the city. In 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 61,993. In 2000 the median age for residents was 32, about average for city and county neighborhoods; the percentage of residents aged 19 to 34 was among the county&#x27;s highest.

The neighborhood was considered &quot;highly diverse&quot; ethnically within Los Angeles, with a high percentage of Asian people for the county. The breakdown was whites, 49.5%; Latinos, 26.1%; Asians, 14.5%; blacks, 5.4%; and others, 4.6%. Mexico (24.7%) and the Philippines (9.8%) were the most common places of birth for the 31.8% of the residents who were born abroad—an average figure for Los Angeles.

The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $67,906, considered high for the city. Renters occupied 46.4% of the housing stock, and house- or apartment-owners held 53.6%. The average household size of 2.7 people was considered average for Los Angeles.

In 2000 there were 3,803 military veterans, or 8.5% of the population, a high percentage compared to the rest of the city.

==Geography==
Northridge touches Porter Ranch and Granada Hills on the north, North Hills on the east, Van Nuys on the southeast, Lake Balboa and Reseda on the south, and Winnetka and Chatsworth on the west.

==History==
===Tongva===
The Northridge area was first inhabited over 2,000 years ago by the Tongva. The village of Totonga was located in the Northridge area. The Tongva lived in dome-shaped houses and are sometimes referred to as the &quot;people of the earth&quot;. They spoke a Takic Uto-Aztecan (Shoshonean) language. Many of their pictographs were destroyed by the development of Greater Los Angeles.

===Mexican land sale===
In the late 1840s, Mexican Governor Pio Pico broke with the tradition of &quot;granting&quot; land and, instead, sold it, without the usual area limitations, to Eulogio de Celis, a native of Spain. By 1850, de Celis was in the Los Angeles census as an agriculturist, 42 years old, and the owner of real estate worth $20,000.

===Land division===
A few years later, the land was split up. The heirs of Eulogio de Celis sold the northerly half – – to Senator George K. Porter, who had called it the &quot;Valley of the Cumberland&quot; and Senator Charles Maclay, who exclaimed: &quot;This is the Garden of Eden.&quot; Porter was interested in ranching; Maclay in subdivision and colonization. Francis Marion (&quot;Bud&quot;) Wright, an Iowa farm boy who migrated to California as a young man, became a ranch hand for Senator Porter and later co-developer of the Hawk Ranch, which is now Northridge land.

=== Early community ===
In 1908, the Southern Pacific Railroad lays tracks through the Hawk Ranch property; following this and continuing the pattern of railroad boom towns, the Hawk Ranch was sold for subdivision and was renamed &quot;Zelzah&quot; in 1910. The name is derived from a biblical name for an oasis as a reference to a water well located in the area. The Zelzah Train Station or Depot was built on the site that is now the northwest corner of Parthenia Avenue and Reseda Boulevard, across the street from the water well. Also in 1910, on January 13, the large balloon America landed on the so-called &quot;Zelzah ranch&quot; after a trip from Huntington Park. By April, The Scandia Land and Loan Company was advertising &quot;Zelzah Acres&quot; with land going for $250 per acre. The company advertised the acres as the &quot;cream of the San Fernando valley, the richest soil in California,&quot; describing the ease of transportation provided by the station, the lack of alkali, adobe or hardpan soil, and stating that water for domestic purposes could be welled from 35 to 65 feet and at 140 to 300 feet for general irrigation; water would later become a major selling point for land in the valley after the arrival of the Los Angeles Aqueduct. The initial growth in the region was so marked that discussions of the creation of new school districts were being forwarded to the county school superintendent Mark Keppel, one of these districts being named Zelzah which would benefit 15 children of school age living nine to ten miles from a schoolhouse. By the beginning of 1912, a post office had been established in Zelzah. By April 1913, sales agents E. O. Hanson &amp; Sons were advertising that only 300 of the original 1100 acres were left for sale, by then at $325 an acre.

The first church built in Northridge, the Faith Bible Church, was built in 1917. By the 1920s, the town became a shipping center for agricultural products and continued to be a rural community for many years.

Residents of Zelzah voted to change the community&#x27;s name to &quot;North Los Angeles&quot; in 1929. Reseda Boulevard, the main thoroughfare of the community, was paved in 1930.

In 1938, the community&#x27;s name was changed to the more popular &quot;Northridge Village&quot; at the suggestion of local resident and director of the Southwest Museum in Los Angeles Carl Denzel; it would later be shortened to just &quot;Northridge&quot;.

=== Post-war years ===
The community began to develop rapidly after World War II and agricultural lots were subdivided into suburban housing tracts to meet the demand for single-family homes by veterans and their families. Commercial development began to take place in the 1950s; the San Fernando Valley State College was opened in 1956. Light industry moved into the area and spurred a building boom. The train depot was torn down in 1961 and underpasses were constructed below the railway over Reseda Boulevard and Parthenia Street.

==Education==
Thirty-four percent of Northridge residents aged 25 and older had earned a four-year degree by 2000, an average percentage for the city but high for the county. The percentages of the same-age residents with a bachelor&#x27;s degree and a master&#x27;s degree or higher were high for the county.

===Primary and secondary schools===
In 1962, Nobel Junior High School in Northridge became the first air-conditioned school in the Los Angeles school district.

In 1982 the board considered closing Prairie Street Elementary School in Northridge. It was located on the California State University, Northridge campus, and that university used Prairie as a laboratory school. In April 1983 an advisory committee of the LAUSD recommended closing eight LAUSD schools, including Prairie Street School. In August 1983 the board publicly considered closing Prairie, which had 280 students at the time. In 1984 the board voted to close the Prairie Street School. In 1985 some parents were trying to have Prairie Street School reopened.

=== Colleges ===
California State University, Northridge, or CSUN, part of the California State University system, offers bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in a number of disciplines. The school is a major producer of K-12 teachers in the region and the nation as a whole. CSUN also has engineering, business, and film programs.

CSUN had its beginnings as a college on Nordhoff Street and Etiwanda Avenue and officially opened in 1956 as San Fernando Valley Campus of Los Angeles State College of Applied Arts and Sciences. Two years later it separated from its parent and became San Fernando Valley State College. By the early 1970s, however, this institution became known as California State University, Northridge. By fall of 2016, CSUN had reached enrollment of almost 40,000 students.

A 2004 study revealed that CSUN is a major contributor to the local economy: between $663 million and $686 million annually. Additionally, CSUN employs 5,800 people directly through the university and adds another 5,700 to 6,000 jobs into the local economy.

==Entertainment==
===Motion pictures and television===

Silent star Janet Gaynor and her costume-designer husband Adrian were the first owners of a spacious estate in Northridge, which was later sold to Barbara Stanwyck and Robert Taylor. Later, actor Jack Oakie owned the property and lived on it. The Oakie house was set for the wrecking ball, but in 2010 the city agreed to buy the Tudor-style stone landmark and its ranch estate.

Marion Marx, wife of Zeppo Marx, and Barbara Stanwyck started Marwyck Ranch as a horse breeding farm. The original house and a small portion of the ranch still exist, and is managed by the city as Oakridge Estate Park. Northridge was known as the &quot;Horse Capital of the West,&quot; with regular Sunday horse shows, annual stampedes, and country fairs.

===Devonshire Downs===
In the late 1960s, Devonshire Downs was the site of two major rock music festivals. The little-known two-day 1967 &quot;Fantasy Faire and Magic Music Festival&quot; (at &quot;Devonshire Meadows&quot;) featured The Doors, Jefferson Airplane, Country Joe and the Fish, The Grass Roots, Canned Heat, Iron Butterfly and several other bands. The better-known but confusingly named 1969 &quot;Newport Pop Festival&quot; was a massive three-day event that featured Jimi Hendrix and many other top acts. It took place in June and was briefly the largest music festival ever held before losing that distinction to Woodstock the following August. Like its famous successor, it had problems with large numbers of gate-crashers, and some young attendees far from home camped out nearby in sleeping bags. Unlike Woodstock, &quot;nearby&quot; included parts of suburban Northridge, where most of the local residents were horrified to find their neighborhoods invaded by &quot;hippies&quot;. A ban on rock music festivals soon followed.

==Earthquakes==
The 1994 Northridge earthquake was named for Northridge based on early estimates of the location of the quake&#x27;s epicenter; however, further refinements showed it to be technically in neighboring Reseda. The earthquake, which occurred on a blind thrust fault, was one of the strongest ground motions ever recorded in North America. Freeways collapsed, and many buildings suffered irreparable damages. Vertical and horizontal accelerations lifted structures off their foundations. During the 1994 quake, the Northridge Hospital Medical Center remained open and treated more than 1,000 patients who came to the facility during the first few days after the magnitude 6.7 quake.

This was the second time in 23 years that the area had been affected by a strong earthquake. On February 9, 1971, the San Fernando earthquake (also known as the Sylmar earthquake) struck, having a magnitude of 6.5.

<doc id="81586" wikidata="Q44426" url="?curid=81586" title="Rainer Werner Fassbinder">
<text>Rainer Werner Fassbinder (; 31 May 1945 – 10 June 1982), sometimes credited as R. W. Fassbinder, was a German filmmaker, dramatist and actor. He is widely regarded as one of the major figures and catalysts of the New German Cinema movement. Versatile and prolific, his over 40 films span a variety of genres, most frequently blending elements of Hollywood melodrama with social criticism and avant-garde techniques. His films, according to him, explored &quot;the exploitability of feelings&quot;. His work was deeply rooted in post-war German culture: the aftermath of Nazism, the German economic miracle, and the terror of the Red Army Faction. He worked with a company of actors and technicians who frequently appeared in his projects.

Fassbinder began leading the acting troupe Anti-Theater in 1967, with whom he staged some of his earliest productions. His first feature-length film was a gangster movie called &quot;Love Is Colder Than Death&quot; (1969); he scored his first domestic commercial success with &quot;The Merchant of Four Seasons&quot; (1972) and his first international success with &quot;&quot; (1974), both of which are considered masterpieces by contemporary critics. Big-budget projects such as &quot;Despair&quot; (1978), &quot;Lili Marleen&quot; and &quot;Lola&quot; (both 1981) followed.
His greatest success came with &quot;The Marriage of Maria Braun&quot; (1979), chronicling the rise and fall of a German woman in the wake of World War II. Other notable films include the lesbian chamber drama &quot;The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant&quot; (1972), &quot;Fox and His Friends&quot; (1975), &quot;Satan&#x27;s Brew&quot; (1976), &quot;In a Year of 13 Moons&quot; (1978), and &quot;Querelle&quot; (1982), all of which dealt with homoerotic themes. He also directed the TV series &quot;World on a Wire&quot; (1973) and &quot;Berlin Alexanderplatz&quot; (1980).

Fassbinder died on 10 June 1982, at age 37, from a lethal cocktail of cocaine and barbiturates. His career lasted less than two decades, but he was extremely prolific; between 1967 and 1982, he completed over 40 feature films, 24 plays, two television serials, three short films, and four video productions, winning five of the most prestigious prizes for feature film in Germany, including the Golden Bear and multiple German Film Awards. His premature death is often considered the end of the New German Cinema timeframe.

==Early life==
Fassbinder was born in the small town of Bad Wörishofen on 31 May 1945. He was born three weeks after US Army occupied the town and the unconditional surrender of Germany. The aftermath of World War II deeply marked his childhood and the lives of his family. In compliance with his mother&#x27;s wishes, Fassbinder later claimed he was born on 31 May 1946, to more clearly establish himself as a child of the post-war period; his real age was revealed shortly before his death. He was the only child of Liselotte Pempeit (1922–93), a translator, and Helmut Fassbinder, a doctor who worked from the couple&#x27;s apartment in Sendlinger Straße, near Munich&#x27;s red light district. When he was three months old, he was left with a paternal uncle and aunt in the country, since his parents feared he would not survive the winter with them. He was one year old when he was returned to his parents in Munich. Fassbinder&#x27;s mother came from the Free City of Danzig (now Gdańsk, Poland), whence many Germans had fled following World War II. As a result, a number of her relatives came to live with them in Munich.

Fassbinder&#x27;s parents were cultured members of the bourgeoisie. His father concentrated on his career, which he saw as a means to inspire his passion for writing poetry. His mother largely ignored him as well, spending the majority of her time with her husband working on his career. In 1951, Liselotte Pempeit and Helmut Fassbinder divorced. Helmut moved to Cologne while Liselotte raised her son as a single parent in Munich. To support herself and her child, Pempeit took in boarders and found employment as a German to English translator. When she was working, she often sent her son to the cinema to pass time. Later in life, Fassbinder claimed that he saw at least one film a day, sometimes as many as four per day. During this period, Pempeit was often away from her son for long periods while she recuperated from tuberculosis. In his mother&#x27;s absence, Fassbinder was looked after by his mother&#x27;s tenants and friends. As he was often left alone, he became used to the independence and later became a juvenile delinquent. He clashed with his mother&#x27;s younger lover Siegfried, who lived with them when Fassbinder was around eight or nine years old. He had a similar difficult relationship with the much older journalist Wolff Eder (c.1905–71), who became his stepfather in 1959. Early in his adolescence, Fassbinder came out as bisexual.

As a teen, Fassbinder was sent to boarding school. His time there was marred by his repeated escape attempts, and he eventually left school before any final examinations. At the age of 15, he moved to Cologne with his father. Though they argued constantly, Fassbinder stayed with his father for a couple of years while attending night school. To earn money, he worked small jobs; he also helped his father, who rented apartments to migrant workers. During this time, Fassbinder began to immerse himself in his father&#x27;s world of culture, writing poems, short plays, and stories.

==Beginnings==
In 1963, aged 18, Fassbinder returned to Munich with plans to attend night school with the idea to eventually study drama. Following his mother&#x27;s advice, he took acting lessons and from 1964 to 1966 attended the Fridl-Leonhard Studio for actors in Munich. There, he met Hanna Schygulla, who would become one of his most important actors. During this time, aged 20, he made his first 8mm short films, worked as a sound man in student films and as an assistant director or in small acting roles in theatre. During this period, he also wrote the tragic-comic play: &quot;Drops on Hot Stones&quot;. To gain entry to the Berlin Film School, Fassbinder submitted a film version of his play &quot;Parallels&quot;. He also entered several 8 mm films including &quot;This Night&quot; (now considered lost), but he was turned down for admission, as were Werner Schroeter and Rosa von Praunheim who would also have careers as film directors.

He returned to Munich where he continued with his writing. He also made two short films, &quot;The City Tramp&quot; (&quot;Der Stadtstreicher&quot;, 1966) and &quot;The Little Chaos&quot; (&quot;Das Kleine Chaos&quot;, 1967). Shot in black and white, they were financed by Fassbinder&#x27;s lover, Christoph Roser, an aspiring actor from a wealthy family, in exchange for leading roles. Fassbinder acted in both of these films, which also featured Irm Hermann. In the latter, his mother – under the name of Lilo Pempeit – played the first of many parts in her son&#x27;s films.

==Theater career==
At age 22, Fassbinder joined the now defunct Munich Action-Theater in 1967; there, he was active as actor, director and scriptwriter. After two months he became the theatre&#x27;s leader. In April 1968, now 23, he directed the production of his play &quot;Katzelmacher&quot;, which tells the story of a foreign worker from Greece who becomes the object of intense racial, sexual, and political hatred among a group of Bavarian &quot;slackers&quot;. A few weeks later, in May 1968, the Action-Theater was disbanded after its theater was wrecked by one of its founders. It promptly reformed as the Anti-Theater under Fassbinder&#x27;s direction. The troupe lived and performed together. This close-knit group of young actors included among them Fassbinder, Peer Raben, Harry Baer and Kurt Raab, who along with Hanna Schygulla and Irm Hermann became the most important members of his cinematic stock company. Working with the Anti-Theater, Fassbinder continued writing, directing and acting. In the space of 18 months he directed 12 plays. Of these 12 plays, four were written by Fassbinder; he rewrote five others.

The style of his stage directing closely resembled that of his early films, a mixture of choreographed movement and static poses, taking its cues from musicals, cabaret, films and the student protest movement.

After he made his earliest feature films at age 24 in 1969, Fassbinder centered the efforts of his career as film director, but maintained an intermittent foothold in the theater until his death. He worked in various productions throughout Germany and made a number of radio plays in the early 1970s. In 1974 at age 29, Fassbinder took directorial control over the Theater am Turm (TAT) of Frankfurt; when this project ended in failure and controversy, Fassbinder became less interested in theater.

In honor of Rosa von Praunheim, Fassbinder staged the play &quot;Dedicated to Rosa von Praunheim&quot;.

==Early films and acclaim==
Fassbinder used his theatrical work as a springboard for making films; and many of the Anti-Theater actors and crew worked with him throughout his entire career (for instance, he made 20 films each with actresses Hanna Schygulla and Irm Herrmann). He was strongly influenced by Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Verfremdungseffekt&quot; (alienation effect) and the French New Wave cinema, particularly the works of Jean-Luc Godard. He also praised &quot;The Damned&quot; (1969) by Luchino Visconti his favorite movie. Other filmmakers who influenced Fassbinder included Howard Hawks, Michael Curtiz, Raoul Walsh, and Nicholas Ray.

Fassbinder developed his rapid working methods early. Because he knew his actors and technicians so well, Fassbinder was able to complete as many as four or five films per year on extremely low budgets. This allowed him to compete successfully for the government grants needed to continue making films.

Unlike the other major &quot;auteurs&quot; of the New German Cinema, Volker Schlöndorff, Werner Herzog and Wim Wenders, who started out making movies, Fassbinder&#x27;s stage background was evident throughout his work. Additionally, he learned how to handle all phases of production, from writing and acting to direction and theater management. This versatility surfaced in his films too where, in addition to some of the aforementioned responsibilities, Fassbinder served as composer, production designer, cinematographer, producer and editor. He also appeared in 30 projects of other directors.

By 1976, Fassbinder had gained international prominence, prizes at major film festivals, premieres and retrospectives in Paris, New York and Los Angeles, and a study of his work by Tony Rayns had been published. All these factors helped make him a familiar name among cinephiles and campus audiences throughout the world. He lived in Munich when not traveling, rented a house in Paris with ex-wife Ingrid Caven. He was often seen in gay bars in New York, earning him cult hero status, but also a controversial reputation in and out of his films. His films were a fixture in art houses of the time after he became internationally known with &quot;&quot;. In 1977, he was a member of the jury at the 27th Berlin International Film Festival.

==Film career==

Starting at the age of 21, Fassbinder made forty-four films and television dramas in 15 years, along with directing 15 plays for the theatre. These films were largely written or adapted for the screen by Fassbinder. He was also art director on most of the early films, editor or co-editor on many of them (often credited as Franz Walsh, though the spelling varies), and he acted in 19 of his own films as well as for other directors. He wrote 14 plays, created new versions of six classical plays, and directed or co-directed 25 stage plays. He wrote and directed four radio plays and wrote song lyrics. In addition, he wrote 33 screenplays and collaborated with other screenwriters on 13 more. On top of this, he occasionally performed many other roles such as cinematographer and producer on a small number of them. Working with a regular ensemble of actors and technicians, he was able to complete films ahead of schedule and often under budget and thus compete successfully for government subsidies. He worked fast, typically omitting rehearsals and going with the first take.

Fassbinder&#x27;s first ten films (1969–1971) were said to be an extension of his work in the theater, shot usually with a static camera and with deliberately unnaturalistic dialogue.

In 1971 through 1977, his films brought him international attention, with films modeled, to ironic effect, on the melodramas Douglas Sirk made in Hollywood in the 1950s. In these films, Fassbinder explored how deep-rooted prejudices about race, sex, sexual orientation, politics and class are inherent in society, while also tackling his trademark subject of the everyday fascism of family life and friendship.

The final films, from around 1977 until his death, were more varied, with international actors sometimes used and the stock company disbanded, although the casts of some films were still filled with Fassbinder regulars. He became increasingly idiosyncratic in terms of plot, form and subject matter in movies like &quot;The Marriage of Maria Braun&quot; (1979), &quot;The Third Generation&quot; (1979) and &quot;Querelle&quot; (1982). He also articulated his themes in the bourgeois milieu with his trilogy about women in post-fascist Germany: &quot;The Marriage of Maria Braun&quot; (1979), &quot;The Angst of Veronica Voss&quot; and &quot;Lola&quot;.

&quot;I would like to build a house with my films&quot;, Fassbinder once remarked. &quot;Some are the cellars, others the walls, still others the windows. But I hope in the end it will be a house.&quot;

Fassbinder&#x27;s work as a filmmaker was honored in the 2007 exhibition &quot;Fassbinder: Berlin Alexanderplatz&quot;, which was organized by Klaus Biesenbach at the Museum of Contemporary Art together with Kunst-Werke Institute for Contemporary Art, Berlin. For his exhibition at MoMA, Klaus Biesenbach received the International Association of Art Critics (AICA) award.

===Avant-garde films (1969–1971)===
Working simultaneously in theater and film, Fassbinder created his own style from a fusion of the two artforms. His ten early films are characterized by a self-conscious and assertive formalism. Influenced by Jean-Luc Godard, Jean-Marie Straub and the theories of Bertolt Brecht, these films are austere and minimalist in style. Although praised by many critics, they proved too demanding and inaccessible for a mass audience. Fassbinder&#x27;s rapid working methods had begun by this stage.

====&quot;Love Is Colder Than Death&quot; (1969)====
Shot in black and white with a shoestring budget in April 1969, Fassbinder&#x27;s first feature-length film, &quot;Love Is Colder Than Death&quot; (1969) (&quot;Liebe ist kälter als der Tod&quot;), was a deconstruction of the American gangster films of the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. Fassbinder plays the lead role of Franz, a small-time pimp who is torn between his mistress Joanna, a sex worker played by Hanna Schygulla, and his friend Bruno, a gangster sent after Franz by the syndicate that he has refused to join. Joanna informs the police of a bank robbery the two men have planned. Bruno is killed in the shootout, but Franz and Joanna escape.

&quot;Love Is Colder Than Death&quot; is a low key film with muted tone, long sequences, non-naturalistic acting and little dialogue. Success was not immediate. &quot;Love Is Colder Than Death&quot; was ill-received at its premiere at the Berlin Film Festival. The film, however, already displays the themes that were to remain present through the director&#x27;s subsequent work: loneliness, the longing for companionship and love, and the fear and reality of betrayal.

====&quot;Katzelmacher&quot; (1969)====
Fassbinder&#x27;s second film, &quot;Katzelmacher&quot; (1969), (Bavarian pejorative slang term for a foreign worker from the Mediterranean), was received more positively, garnering five prizes after its debut at Mannheim. It features a group of rootless and bored young couples who spend much of their time in idle chatter, empty boasting, drinking, playing cards, intriguing or simply sitting around. The arrival of Jorgos, a guest worker from Greece, leads to a growing curiosity on the part of the women and the antagonism among the men living in a suburban block of apartments in Munich. This kind of social criticism, featuring alienated characters unable to escape the forces of oppression, is a constant throughout Fassbinder&#x27;s oeuvre. &quot;Katzelmacher&quot; was adapted from Fassbinder&#x27;s first produced play – a short piece that was expanded from forty minutes to feature length, moving the action from a country village to Munich and delaying the appearance of Jorgos.

====&quot;Gods of the Plague&quot; (1970)====
&quot;Gods of the Plague&quot; (&quot;Götter der Pest&quot;) is a bleak gangster film with a winter setting, shot mostly indoors and at night. The character of Franz (from Fassbinder&#x27;s first film, but now played by Harry Baer) is released from prison, but falls back with the wrong crowd. He teams up with his best friend, a black Bavarian criminal who killed his brother, to raid a supermarket. Both men are betrayed by Franz&#x27;s jilted lover Joanna who tips off the police. Franz is killed, and the film ends at his laconic funeral.

Similar in plot and characters to both &quot;Love is Colder than Death&quot; (1969) and &quot;The American Soldier&quot; (1970), &quot;Gods of the Plague&quot;″s theme of homoerotic love would reappear repeatedly in the director&#x27;s films.

====&quot;Why Does Herr R. Run Amok?&quot; (1970)====
The last of the four films Fassbinder shot in 1969, was his first in color, &quot;Why Does Herr R. Run Amok?&quot; &quot;(Warum läuft Herr R. Amok?)&quot;. It was co-directed by Michael Fengler (the friend who had been his cameraman on the short film &quot;The Little Chaos&quot; in 1967). Only the outlines of the scenes were sketched by Fassbinder. Fengler and the cast then improvised the dialogue. Fassbinder asserted that this was really Fengler&#x27;s work rather than his. Nevertheless, the two were jointly given a directorial award for the project in the 1971 German Film prize competition, and &quot;Why Does Herr R. Run Amok?&quot; has always been considered among Fassbinder&#x27;s films.

&quot;Why Does Herr R. Run Amok?&quot; portrays the life of Herr Raab, a technical draughtsman married and with a small child. The pressures of middle-class life take a toll on him. A visit by a woman neighbor occasions the incident that gives the film its title. Irritated by the incessant chat between his wife and her friend while he tries to watch TV, Herr Raab kills the neighbor with a blow to the head with a candle stick and then kills both his wife and their son. Herr Raab is later found hanged in an office restroom.

====&quot;The American Soldier&quot; (1970)====
The main theme of the gangster film &quot;The American Soldier&quot; &quot;(Der Amerikanische Soldat)&quot; is that violence is an expression of frustrated love. A sudden frenzied outburst of repressed passion, the revelation of desire and a need for love that has been thwarted and comes too late is central here. The eponymous hit man of the title (actually a German, played by Karl Scheydt) is a cold-blooded contract killer, who returns from Vietnam to his native Munich, where he is hired by three renegade policemen to do away with a number of undesirables. Eventually he ends up killing the girlfriend of one of the policemen with his friend Franz Walsh (Fassbinder). The film closes with the music of the song &quot;So much tenderness&quot;, written by Fassbinder and sung by Gunther Kaufmann. &quot;The American Soldier&quot; is the third and final installment of Fassbinder&#x27;s loose trilogy of gangster pictures formed by &quot;Love Is Colder Than Death&quot; and &quot;Gods of the Plague&quot;. It pays homage to the Hollywood gangster genre, and also alludes to Southern Gothic race narratives.

====&quot;The Niklashausen Journey&quot; (1970)====
In &quot;&quot; (&quot;Die Niklashauser Fahrt&quot;), Fassbinder co-writes and co-directs with Michael Fengler. This avant-garde film, commissioned by the WDR television network, was shot in May 1970 and it was broadcast in October the same year.&quot;The Niklashausen Journey&quot; was loosely based on the real-life of Hans Boehm, a shepherd who in 1476 claimed that the Virgin Mary called him to foment an uprising against the church and upper classes. Despite a temporary success, Boehm&#x27;s followers were eventually massacred and he was burned at the stake. Fassbinder&#x27;s intention was to show how and why revolutions fail. His approach was to compare the political and sexual turmoil of feudal Germany with that of the contraculture movement and the protests of 1968. Fassbinder did not clarify the time frame of the action, mixing medieval elements (including some costumes, settings, speech and music) with those from other time periods, like the Russian Revolution, the Rococo period, postwar Germany and the Third World.

&quot;The Niklashausen Journey&quot;, influenced by Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s &quot;Weekend&quot; and Glauber Rocha&#x27;s &quot;Antonio das Mortes&quot;, consists of only about a dozen or so scenes, most of which are either theatrical tableaux where there is no movement of the characters and the camera darts from speaker to speaker or are shots where characters pace back and forth while giving revolutionary speeches about Marxist struggles and debates on economic theories.

====&quot;Whity&quot; (1970)====
Set in 1876, &quot;Whity&quot; centers on the title character, a mulatto who works as the obsequious servant in the mansion of a dysfunctional family in the American South. He is the illegitimate son of the family patriarch and the black cook. Whity tries to carry out all their orders, however demeaning until several of the family members ask him to kill some of the others. He eventually kills them all and runs away to the desert with a prostitute from the local bar.

The film was shot in Almeria, Spain, in widescreen, on locations built for the Westerns made by Sergio Leone. Its production was particularly traumatic for cast and crew. &quot;Whity&quot;, a mixture of Euro-western and American South melodrama, was badly received by the critics and became Fassbinder&#x27;s biggest flop. The film was neither picked up for theatrical release, nor was there interest for broadcasting it on television. As a result, &quot;Whity&quot; was only seen as its premiere. It remained unavailable until the 1990s, when it began to be screened; now, like almost all of Fassbinder&#x27;s films, it is available on DVD.

====&quot;Rio das Mortes&quot; (1971)====
A whimsical comedy, &quot;Rio das Mortes&quot; follows two young men without prospects who try to raise money to realize their dream of finding a buried treasure in Peru using a map of the Rio das Mortes. The girlfriend of one of them finds the notion stupid and wants to put a stop to it, but eventually the two friends find a patroness to finance their adventure.

Based on an idea by Volker Schlondorff, &quot;Rio das Mortes&quot; was shot in January 1970 following &quot;Why Does Herr R. Run Amok?&quot;, but was broadcast on television a year later in February 1971. The film feels casually constructed; the humor is bland and the plot has been criticized for its sloppiness and poor character development. &quot;Rio das Mortes&quot; is best remembered for a scene unrelated to the plot, as the girlfriend, played by Schygulla, dances to Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; on the jukebox in the company of an oafish leather-jacketed youth, played by Fassbinder.

====&quot;Pioneers in Ingolstadt&quot; (1971)====
&quot;Pioneers in Ingolstadt&quot; &quot;(Pioniere in Ingolstadt)&quot; was adapted from an eponymous play by Marieluise Fleißer written in 1927. It follows two young women whose lives are transformed when army engineers (the pioneers of the title) arrive to their town to build a bridge. One of the women flirts from soldier to soldier, but her friend falls in love only to be abandoned.

Shot in November 1970, &quot;Pioneers in Ingolstaldt&quot; was commissioned for television. Fassbinder wanted to bring the plot from the 1920s to contemporary Germany, but the producers, fearing to offend the German army, refused. A compromise did not satisfy any of the parties, and midway through the project Fassbinder lost interest in it. The film suffered as a consequence, and it ranks among Fassbinder&#x27;s weakest films.

The tensions and bitterness that had surrounded the making of &quot;Whity&quot; led Fassbinder to dismantle the collective project of the Anti-Theater as a production company. Instead, he founded his own production company: Tango films. &quot;Pioneers in Ingolstadt&quot;, although broadcast before the theatrical release of &quot;Beware of a Holy Whore&quot;, was the last film made by Fassbinder during his formative period. In the following year, 1971, Fassbinder shot only one film: &quot;The Merchant of Four Seasons&quot;.

====&quot;Beware of a Holy Whore&quot; (1971)====
&quot;Beware of a Holy Whore&quot; was based, like many of Fassbinder&#x27;s films, on a personal experience – the shooting of his earlier film, the revisionist western &quot;Whity&quot; (1970). The film shows an egomaniacal director, beset by a stalled production, temperamental actors, and a frustrated crew. When asked what the movie he is making is about, he replies: &quot;brutality.&quot; The film ends with a typical Fassbinder-esque irony, as the crew gang up on the director. &quot;Beware of a Holy Whore&quot; marked the end of Fassbinder&#x27;s avant-garde period. It presented such an embittered and radical self-critique that his future films would have to be quite different from the ones made before. After spinning out ten films in not much more than a year (this film was shot only a few months after &quot;Whity&quot;) in a frenzied burst of creativity, his anti-film anti-theater drive seemed to conclude.

===German melodramas (1971–1976)===
After &quot;Pioneers in Ingolstadt&quot;, Fassbinder took an eight-month break from filmmaking. During this time, he turned for a model to Hollywood melodrama, particularly the films German émigré Douglas Sirk made in Hollywood for Universal-International in the 1950s: &quot;All That Heaven Allows&quot;, &quot;Magnificent Obsession&quot; and &quot;Imitation of Life&quot;. Fassbinder was attracted to these films not only because of their entertainment value, but also for their depiction of various kinds of repression and exploitation.

====&quot;The Merchant of Four Seasons&quot; (1971)====
Fassbinder scored his first domestic commercial success with &quot;The Merchant of Four Seasons&quot; (&quot;Händler der vier Jahreszeiten&quot;, 1971). The film portrays a married couple who are fruit sellers. Hans faces rejection from his family after he violently assaults his wife for not bending to his will. She leaves him, but after he suffers a heart attack they reunite, though he now has to employ other men. His restricted ability to function leads him to ponder his own futility. He literally drinks himself to death.

&quot;The Merchant of Four Seasons&quot; uses melodrama as a style to create critical studies of contemporary German life for a general audience. It was Fassbinder&#x27;s first effort to create what he declared he aspired to: a cinematic statement of the human condition that would transcend national boundaries as the films of Michelangelo Antonioni, Ingmar Bergman and Federico Fellini had done. It is also his first realization of what he learned from Sirk: that people, however small they may be, and their emotions, however insignificant they may seem, could be big on the movie screen.

====&quot;The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant&quot; (1972)====
Loneliness is a common theme in Fassbinder&#x27;s work, together with the idea that power becomes a determining factor in all human relationships. His characters yearn for love, but seem condemned to exert an often violent control over those around them. A good example is &quot;The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant&quot; (, 1972) which was adapted by Fassbinder from his plays. The title character is a fashion designer who lives in a self-created dreamland and the action is restricted mostly to her lavish bedroom. After the failure of her second marriage, Petra falls hopelessly and obsessively in love with Karin, a cunning young working-class woman who wants a career in modeling. The model&#x27;s exploitation of Petra mirrors Petra&#x27;s extraordinary psychological abuse of her silent assistant, Marlene. Fassbinder portrays the slow meltdown of these relationships as inevitable, and his actresses (there are no men in the film) move in a slow, trance-like way that hints at a vast world of longing beneath the beautiful, brittle surface.

====&quot;Jail Bait&quot; (1972)====
&quot;&quot; (&quot;Wildwechsel&quot;, 1972), also known as &quot;Wild Game&quot;, is a bleak story of teenage angst, set in industrial northern Germany during the 1950s. As in many other of his films, Fassbinder analyses lower middle class life with characters who, unable to articulate their feelings, bury them in inane phrases and violent acts. Love turns into a power struggle of deception and betrayal. The story centers on Hanni, a precocious 14-year-old schoolgirl who starts a relationship with Franz, a 19-year-old worker in a chicken processing plant. Their romance faces the opposition of the girl&#x27;s conservative parents. Franz is sentenced to nine months in prison for having sex with a minor. When he is released on probation, they continue their relationship and Hanni becomes pregnant. Afraid of her father&#x27;s anger, she persuades Franz to kill him. When Franz returns to prison for this murder, Hanni tells him that their child died at birth and that their love was &quot;only physical&quot;.

Originally made for German television, &quot;Jail Bait&quot; was based on a play by Franz Xaver Kroetz, who violently disagreed with Fassbinder&#x27;s adaptation, calling it pornographic. The luridness of its theme furthered the controversy.

====&quot;World on a Wire&quot; (1973)====
His only science fiction film, &quot;World on a Wire&quot; (&quot;Welt am Draht&quot;, 1973), was a departure for Fassbinder. An adaptation of the pulp sci-fi novel &quot;Simulacron-3&quot; by Daniel F. Galouye, it was made as a two-part, 205-minute production for television using 16mm film stock during a hiatus from the lengthy production of &quot;Effi Briest&quot; and in the same year as &quot;Martha&quot; and &quot;Ali: Fear Eats the Soul&quot;.

A story of realities within realities, &quot;World on a Wire&quot; follows a researcher, working at the institute of cybernetics and future science, who begins to investigate the mysterious death of his mentor. He falls deep into the cover up behind a computer capable of creating an artificial world with units living as human beings unaware that their world is just a computer projection. Made in contemporary Paris, the film was stylistically inspired by Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s &quot;Alphaville&quot; (1965) and in its theme of artificial humans wanting to reach real life anticipated Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982).

====&quot;Ali: Fear Eats the Soul&quot; (1974)====
Fassbinder first gained international success with &quot;Fear Eats the Soul&quot; (&quot;Angst essen Seele auf&quot;, 1974). This film was shot in 15 days in September 1973 with a very low budget, ranking among Fassbinder&#x27;s quickest and cheapest. Nevertheless, the impact on Fassbinder&#x27;s career and in overseas release remains cemented as a great and influential work. It won the International Critics Prize at Cannes and was acclaimed by critics everywhere as one of 1974&#x27;s best films.

&quot;Fear Eats the Soul&quot; was loosely inspired by Sirk&#x27;s &quot;All That Heaven Allows&quot; (1955). It details the vicious response of family and community to a lonely aging white cleaning lady who marries a muscular, much younger black Moroccan immigrant worker. The two are drawn to each other out of mutual loneliness. When their relationship becomes known, they experience various forms of hostility and public rejection. Gradually, their relationship is tolerated, not out of real acceptance, but because those around the good-hearted old lady realize their ability to exploit her is threatened. As the external pressures over the couple begin to subside, internal conflicts surface.

====&quot;Martha&quot; (1974)====
Fassbinder&#x27;s main characters tend to be naifs, either men or women, who are rudely, sometimes murderously, disabused of their romantic illusions. Shot on 16mm film and made for television, &quot;Martha&quot; (1974) is a melodrama about cruelty in a traditional marriage.

The plot focuses on the title character, a spinster librarian. Soon after the death of her father while on vacation in Rome, Martha meets a wealthy civil engineer, who sweeps her off her feet. They encounter each other again at a wedding in her hometown of Constance and soon marry. However, their married life becomes an exercise for her husband to express his sadism and for Martha to endure her masochism. Her husband shows his desire for her violently, leaving marks on her body. He obsessively controls her life, her diet, her taste in music and her interests, until she is confined to their house. Martha&#x27;s initially positive wish to be liked by her oppressive and abusive husband pushes her to such an extreme that she becomes deranged, leading to her own permanent physical paralysis.

====&quot;Effi Briest&quot; (1974)====
&quot;Effi Briest&quot; was Fassbinder&#x27;s dream film and the one in which he invested the most work. While he normally took between nine and 20 days to make a film, this time it required 58 shooting days, dragged out over two years. The film is a period piece adapted from Theodor Fontane&#x27;s classic novel of 1894, concerning the consequences of betrayed love. Set in the closed, repressive Prussian society of the Bismarck era, the film paints a portrait of a woman&#x27;s fate completely linked to an unbending and utterly unforgiving code of social behavior. The plot follows the story of Effi Briest, a young woman who seeks to escape her stifling marriage to a much older man by entering into a brief affair with a charming soldier. Six years later, Effi&#x27;s husband discovers her affair with tragic consequences.

The film served as a showpiece for Fassbinder&#x27;s muse and favorite actress Hanna Schygulla, whose detached acting style fitted the roles the director created for her. Fassbinder made her a star, but artistic differences while making &quot;Effi Briest&quot; created a split that lasted for some years, until Fassbinder called her back to take the role of Maria Braun.

====&quot;Like a Bird on a Wire&quot; (1975)====
&quot;Like a Bird on a Wire&quot; (&quot;Wie ein Vogel auf dem Draht&quot;) is a forty-minute television production featuring Brigitte Mira, the main actress in &quot;Fear eats the Soul&quot;, singing cabaret songs and love ballads from the 1940s and 1950s. Between songs, she drinks and talks about her husbands. The title is borrowed from Leonard Cohen&#x27;s song &quot;Bird on the Wire&quot;, with which the program ends.

Fassbinder considered this project &quot;an attempt to do a show about the Adenauer era. For us it certainly wasn&#x27;t entirely successful. But the film does reveal the utter repulsiveness and sentimentality of the time&quot; he explained.

====&quot;Fox and His Friends&quot; (1975)====
Many of Fassbinder&#x27;s films deal with homosexuality, in keeping with his interest in characters who are social outsiders, but he drew away from most representations of homosexuals in films. In an interview at the 1975 Cannes Film Festival, Fassbinder said about &quot;Fox and His Friends&quot;: &quot;It is certainly the first film in which the characters are homosexuals, without homosexuality being made into a problem. In films, plays or novels, if homosexuals appear, the homosexuality was the problem, or it was a comic turn. But here homosexuality is shown as completely normal, and the problem is something quite different, it&#x27;s a love story, where one person exploits the love of the other person, and that&#x27;s the story I always tell&quot;.

In &quot;Fox and His Friends&quot; (&quot;Faustrecht der Freiheit&quot;, 1974) a sweet but unsophisticated working-class homosexual wins the lottery and falls in love with the elegant son of an industrialist. His lover tries to mold him into a gilt-edged mirror of upper-class values, all the while appropriating Fox&#x27;s lottery winnings for his own ends. He ultimately destroys Fox&#x27;s illusions, leaving him heartbroken and destitute.

Fassbinder worked within the limits of Hollywood melodrama, though the film is partially based on the plight of his then lover Armin Meier (to whom the film is dedicated). The film is notable for Fassbinder&#x27;s performance as the unlucky Fox, in a self-directed starring role.

&quot;Fox and His Friends&quot; has been deemed homophobic by some and overly pessimistic by others. The film&#x27;s homosexuals are not, surprisingly, any different from the film&#x27;s equally lecherous heterosexuals. The film&#x27;s pessimism is far outweighed by Fassbinder&#x27;s indictment of Fox as an active participant in his own victimization, a familiar critique found in many of the director&#x27;s films.

====&quot;Mother Küsters Goes to Heaven&quot; (1975)====
In &quot;Mother Küsters&#x27; Trip to Heaven&quot; (&quot;Mutter Küsters Fahrt zum Himmel&quot;), a melodrama, Emma Küsters becomes the center of media and political attention after her husband, a factory worker, killed his supervisor or his supervisor&#x27;s son and then himself when lay offs were announced. The film drew on both Sirk&#x27;s melodramas and Weimar-era workers&#x27; films, connecting the genres to tell a political coming-of-age story about Mother Küsters, who seeks to understand what led to her husband&#x27;s actions and how to respond. The film is very critical of the era&#x27;s politics and media, as the people to whom Emma Küsters turns all exploit her and her experience. The media, communists, anarchists and even her own family members all take advantage of Mother Küsters&#x27;s tragedy to advance their own agendas.

====&quot; Fear of Fear&quot; (1975)====
Made for German television, &quot;&quot; (&quot;Angst vor der Angst&quot;) is a psychological drama about a middle-class housewife, locked into a dull life with a distracted husband, two small children, and openly hostile in-laws. She becomes addicted to valium and alcohol overwhelmed by an irrational anxiety and fear of her inexorable descent into madness.

&quot;Fear of Fear&quot; is similar in theme to &quot;Martha&quot;, which also portrays the effect of a dysfunctional marriage in an oppressed housewife, the central role was again played by Margit Carstensen.

====&quot;I Only Want You to Love Me&quot; (1976)====
&quot;I Only Want You to Love Me&quot; (&quot;Ich will doch nur, daß ihr mich liebt&quot;, 1976) tells the story of Peter, a construction worker in jail for manslaughter. His life is recounted in a series of flashbacks. A hard working man, Peter spends his spare time building a house for his cold unloving parents. He marries and finds a job in another city, but in his desperate yearning for affection he tries to buy the love of those around him with expensive gifts which soon makes him fall into a spiral of debt. When he sees his own unrequited love for his parents reflected during an argument in a bar, he kills a man who serves as a proxy for his father.

The film was made for television and shot during a pause while making &quot;Satan&#x27;s Brew&quot;. Based on a true account taken from &quot;For Life&quot;, a book of interviews edited by Klaus Antes and Christiane Erhardt, it was Fassbinder&#x27;s personal reflections on childhood and adolescence.

====&quot;Satan&#x27;s Brew&quot; (1976)====
In a time of professional crisis, Fassbinder made &quot;Satan&#x27;s Brew&quot; (&quot;Satansbraten&quot;, 1976) a bleak amoral comedy that pays homage to Antonin Artaud&#x27;s theatre of cruelty. Stylistically far from the melodramas that made him known internationally, &quot;Satan&#x27;s Brew&quot; gave way to a new phase in his career. In &quot;Satan&#x27;s Brew&quot;, a neurotic poet suffering from writer&#x27;s block struggles to make ends meet while dealing with a frustrated long suffering wife, a half witted brother and various prostitutes and masochist women who drift in and out of his life. He convinces himself to be the reincarnation of the gay romantic poet Stefan George (1868–1933) after he plagiarizes his poem &quot;The Albatros&quot;.

===International films (1976–1982)===
Enthusiasm for Fassbinder&#x27;s films grew quickly after &quot;Fear Eats the Soul&quot;. Vincent Canby paid tribute to Fassbinder as &quot;the most original talent since Godard&quot;. In 1977, the New Yorker Theater in Manhattan held a Fassbinder Festival.

However, as enthusiasm for Fassbinder grew outside of Germany, his films still failed to impress the native audience. At home, he was better known for his television work and for his open homosexuality. Coupled with the controversial issues of his films – terrorism, state violence, racism, sexual politics – it seemed that everything Fassbinder did provoked or offended someone.

After completing in 1978 his last low-budget and very personal ventures (&quot;In a Year of 13 Moons&quot; and &quot;The Third Generation&quot;) he would concentrate on making films that were becoming increasingly garish and stylized. However, his TV series &quot;Berlin Alexanderplatz&quot; was a naturalistic adaptation of the two-volume novel by Alfred Döblin, which Fassbinder had read many times.

====&quot;Chinese Roulette&quot; (1976)====
&quot;Chinese Roulette&quot; (&quot;Chinesisches Roulette&quot;) is a gothic thriller with an ensemble cast. The film follows a twelve-year-old crippled girl, Angela, who, due to her parents&#x27; lack of affection, arranges an encounter between them with their respective lovers at the family country estate. The film climaxes with a truth-guessing game. The players divide into two teams, which take it in turn to pick out one member of the other side and ask them question about people and objects. The game is played at the suggestion of Angela, who plays against her mother. When the mother asks: &quot;In the Third Reich, what would that person have been?&quot;, Angela&#x27;s answer is &quot;Commandant of the concentration camp at Bergen Belsen&quot;; it is her mother she is describing.

====&quot;The Stationmaster&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1977)====
There are no happy endings in Fassbinder&#x27;s films. His protagonists, usually weak men or women with masochistic tendencies, pay a heavy price for their victimization. &quot;The Stationmaster&#x27;s Wife&quot; (&quot;Bolwieser&quot;) is based on a 1931 novel, &quot;Bolwieser: The Novel Of a Husband&quot; by the Bavarian writer Oskar Maria Graf. The plot follows the downfall of Xaver Bolwieser, a railway stationmaster submitted to the will of his domineering and unfaithful wife, whose repeated infidelities completely ruin Bolwieser&#x27;s life. Broadcast initially as a two-part television series, &quot;The Stationmaster&#x27;s Wife&quot; was shortened to a 112-minute feature film and released in the first anniversary of Fassbinder&#x27;s death. The film stars Kurt Raab, Fassbinder&#x27;s close friend whom the director usually cast as a pathetic man. Raab was also set designer of Fassbinder&#x27;s films until their friendship and professional relationship broke up after making this film.

====&quot;Germany in Autumn&quot; (1978)====
&quot;Germany in Autumn&quot; &quot;(Deutschland im Herbst)&quot; is an omnibus film, a collective work of eight German filmmakers including Fassbinder, Alf Brustellin, Volker Schlöndorff, Bernhard Sinkel and Alexander Kluge, the main organizer behind the project. They took a look at the wave of guilt and paranoia that afflicted West Germany&#x27;s society and its authorities in the months between the kidnapping and murder of industrialist Hanns Martin Schleyer by Red Army Faction members and the deaths of Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin and Jan-Carl Raspe in Stammheim Prison. The film is a document about terrorism and its sociopolitical aftermath. It begins with Schleyer&#x27;s wake, a segment filmed by Alexander Kluge and Volker Schlöndorff, and it ends with the tumultuous joint funeral of Baader, Ensslin, and Raspe in Stuttgart.

====&quot;Despair&quot; (1978)====
Fassbinder made three films in English, a language in which he was not proficient: &quot;Despair&quot; (1978), &quot;Lili Marleen&quot; (1980) and &quot;Querelle&quot; (1982). All three films have international actors and are very ambitious, yet each faced artistic and commercial problems.
&quot;Despair&quot; is based upon the 1936 novel of the same name by Vladimir Nabokov, adapted by Tom Stoppard and featuring Dirk Bogarde. It was made on a budget of 6,000,000 DEM, exceeding the total cost of Fassbinder&#x27;s first 15 films.

&quot;Despair – A Journey into the Light&quot; (&quot;Despair – Eine Reise ins Licht&quot;) tells the story of Hermann Hermann, an unbalanced Russian émigré and chocolate magnate, whose business and marriage have both grown bitter. The factory is close to bankruptcy, and his vulgar wife is chronically unfaithful. He hatches an elaborate plot to take a new identity in the belief it will free him of all his worries. The story of Hermann&#x27;s descent into madness is juxtaposed against the rise of National Socialism in the Germany of the 1930s.

====&quot;In a Year of Thirteen Moons&quot; (1978)====

&quot;In a Year of Thirteen Moons&quot; (&quot;In einem Jahr mit 13 Monden&quot;, 1978) is Fassbinder&#x27;s most personal and bleakest work. The film follows the tragic life of Elvira, a transsexual formerly known as Erwin. In the last few days before her suicide, she decides to visit some of the important people and places in her life. In one sequence, Elvira wanders through the slaughterhouse where she worked as Erwin, recounting her history amid the meat-hooked corpses of cattle whose slit throats rain blood onto the floor. In another scene, Elvira returns to the orphanage where she was raised by nuns and hears the brutal story of her childhood. Fassbinder&#x27;s camera tracks the nun (played by his mother) telling Elvira&#x27;s story; she moves with a kind of military precision through the grounds, recounting the story in blazing detail, unaware that Elvira had collapsed and can no longer hear it.

&quot;In a Year of Thirteen Moons&quot; was explicitly personal, a reaction to his former lover Armin Meier&#x27;s suicide. In addition to writing, directing, and editing, Fassbinder also designed the production and worked as the cameraman. When the film played in the New York Film Festival in October 1979, critic Vincent Canby (who championed Fassbinder&#x27;s work in the United States) wrote, &quot;Its only redeeming feature is genius.&quot;

====&quot;The Marriage of Maria Braun&quot; (1979)====

With &quot;The Marriage of Maria Braun&quot; (&quot;Die Ehe der Maria Braun&quot;), his greatest success, Fassbinder finally attained the popular acceptance he sought with German audiences. The title character is an ambitious and strong willed woman separated from her husband towards the end of World War II. The plot follows Maria Braun&#x27;s steady rise as a successful business woman during the Adenauer era. Maria&#x27;s dream of a happy life with her husband remains unfulfilled. Her professional achievements are not accompanied by personal happiness. The film, constructed in the Hollywood tradition of &quot;women&#x27;s pictures&quot; presenting a woman overcoming hardships, serves also as a parable of the West Germany economic miracle embodied in the character of Maria Braun. Her story of manipulation and betrayal parallels Germany&#x27;s spectacular postwar economic recovery in terms of its cost in human values.

The film was the first part of a trilogy centered on women during the post-war &quot;economic miracle&quot; which was completed with &quot;Lola&quot; (1981) and &quot;Veronika Voss&quot; (1982).

====&quot;The Third Generation&quot; (1979)====
The economic success of &quot;The Marriage of Maria Braun&quot; allowed Fassbinder to pay his debts and to embark on a personal project, &quot;The Third Generation&quot; (&quot;Die Dritte Generation&quot;, 1979), a black comedy about terrorism. Fassbinder found financial backing for this film difficult to acquire and it was ultimately made on a small budget and borrowed money. As he did with &quot;In a Year of Thirteen Moons&quot;, Fassbinder worked again as the film&#x27;s cameraman.

The film concerns a group of aspiring terrorists from leftist bourgeois backgrounds who kidnap an industrialist during carnival season unaware that they have been manipulated by the capitalist and the authorities whose hidden agenda is for terrorism to create a demand for security hardware and to gain support for harsher security measures. The actions of the ineffectual cell of underground terrorists are overlaid with a soundtrack filled with newscast, voiceovers, music and gibberish. The political theme of the film aroused controversy.

====&quot;Berlin Alexanderplatz&quot; (1980)====
Returning to his explorations of German history, Fassbinder finally realized his dream of adapting Alfred Döblin&#x27;s 1929 novel &quot;Berlin Alexanderplatz&quot;. A television series running more than 13 hours, with a two-hour coda (released in the U.S. as a 15-hour feature), it was the culmination of the director&#x27;s inter-related themes of love, life, and power.

&quot;Berlin Alexanderplatz&quot; centers on Franz Biberkopf, a former convict and minor pimp, who tries to stay out of trouble but is dragged down by crime, poverty and the duplicity of those around him. His best friend, Reinhold, makes him lose an arm and murders Franz&#x27; prostitute girlfriend, Mieze. The love triangle of Franz, Reinhold and Mieze is staged against the rising tide of Nazism in Germany. The film emphasized the sadomasochist relationship between Biberkopf and Reinhold stressing its homoerotic nature. Fassbinder had read the book at age 14; later claiming that it helped him survive a &quot;murderous puberty&quot;. The influence of Döblin&#x27;s novel can be seen in many of Fassbinder&#x27;s films most of whose protagonists are named Franz, some with the surname Biberkopf like the naïve working class lottery winner in &quot;Fox and His Friends&quot;, who is played by Fassbinder. He also took the pseudonym of Franz Walsch for his work as editor on his own films: Walsch was an oblique homage to director Raoul Walsh.

====&quot;Lili Marleen&quot; (1981)====
Fassbinder took on the Nazi period with &quot;Lili Marleen&quot;, an international co production, shot in English and with a large budget. The script was vaguely based on the autobiography of World War II singer Lale Andersen, &quot;The Sky Has Many Colors&quot;. The film is constructed as a big, tear-jerking Hollywood melodrama in its depiction of the unfulfilled love story between a German variety singer separated by the war from a Swiss Jewish composer. Central to the story is the song that gives the film its title.

Fassbinder presents the period of Nazi Germany as a predictable development of German history that was staged as spectacle supported by hate. Filmed with a morbid nostalgia for swastikas, showbiz glitz and as a cloak-and-dagger romance, the main theme of &quot;Lili Marleen&quot; is the question: is it morally justifiable to survive under National Socialism, as the naïve singer does by having a successful career?

====&quot;Theater in Trance&quot; (1981)====

&quot;Theater in Trance&quot; is a documentary which Fassbinder shot in Cologne in June 1981 at the &quot;Theaters of the World&quot; Festival. Over scenes from groups such as the Squat Theatre and the Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch Fassbinder spoke passages from Antonin Artaud as well as his own commentary.

====&quot;Lola&quot; (1981)====
&quot;Lola&quot; tells the story of an upright, new building commissioner who arrives in a small town. He falls in love with Lola, innocently unaware of the fact that she is a famed prostitute and the mistress of an unscrupulous developer. Unable to reconcile his idealistic image of Lola with reality, the commissioner spirals into the very corruption he had sought to fight out.

====&quot;Veronika Voss&quot; (1982)====
Fassbinder won the Golden Bear at the 32nd Berlin International Film Festival for &quot;Veronika Voss&quot;. The original German title, &quot;Die Sehnsucht der Veronika Voss&quot;, translates as &quot;The longing of Veronika Voss&quot;. Set in the 1950s, the film depicts the twilight years of the title character, a faded Nazi starlet. A sports reporter becomes enthralled by the unbalanced actress and discovers that she is under the power of a villainous doctor who supplies her with the drugs she craves so long as she can pay the exorbitant fee. Despite the reporter&#x27;s best attempts, he is unable to save her from a terrible end.

====&quot;Querelle&quot; (1982)====
Fassbinder did not live to see the premiere of his last film, &quot;Querelle&quot;, based on Jean Genet&#x27;s novel &quot;Querelle de Brest&quot;. The plot follows the title character, a handsome sailor who is a thief and hustler. Frustrated in a homoerotic relationship with his own brother, Querelle betrays those who love him and pays them even with murder.

==Personal life==

Fassbinder had relationships with both men and women. He rarely kept his professional and personal life separate, and was known to cast family, friends and lovers in his films. Early in his career he had a lasting but fractured relationship with Irm Hermann, a former secretary whom he forced to become an actress. Fassbinder usually cast her in unglamorous roles, most notably as the unfaithful wife in &quot;The Merchant of Four Seasons&quot; and the silent abused assistant in &quot;The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant&quot;.

Hermann idolized him, but Fassbinder tormented and tortured her for over a decade. This included domestic violence: &quot;He couldn&#x27;t conceive of my refusing him, and he tried everything. He almost beat me to death on the streets of Bochum ...&quot; In 1977, Hermann became romantically involved with another man and became pregnant by him. Fassbinder proposed to her and offered to adopt the child; she turned him down.

In 1969, while portraying the lead role in the TV film &quot;Baal&quot; under the direction of Volker Schlöndorff, Fassbinder met Günther Kaufmann, a black Bavarian actor who had a minor role in the film. Despite the fact that Kaufmann was married and had two children, Fassbinder fell madly in love with him. The two began a turbulent affair which ultimately affected the production of &quot;Baal&quot;. Fassbinder tried to buy Kaufmann&#x27;s love by casting him in major roles in his films and buying him expensive gifts.

Kaufmann relished the attention and became more demanding. Fassbinder bought him four Lamborghinis over the period of a year; Kauffmann wrecked one and sold the others if they failed to meet his expectations. The relationship came to an end when Kaufmann became romantically involved with composer Peer Raben. After the end of their relationship, Fassbinder continued to cast Kaufmann in his films, albeit in minor roles. Kaufmann appeared in 14 of Fassbinder&#x27;s films, with the lead role in &quot;Whity&quot; (1971).

Although he claimed to be opposed to matrimony as an institution, in 1970 Fassbinder married Ingrid Caven, an actress who regularly appeared in his films. Their wedding reception was recycled in the film he was making at that time, &quot;The American Soldier&quot;. Their relationship of mutual admiration survived the complete failure of their two-year marriage. &quot;Ours was a love story in spite of the marriage&quot;, Caven explained in an interview, adding about her former husband&#x27;s sexuality: &quot;Rainer was a homosexual who also needed a woman. It&#x27;s that simple and that complex.&quot; The three most important women of Fassbinder&#x27;s life, Irm Hermann, Ingrid Caven and Juliane Lorenz, his last partner, were not disturbed by his romantic and sexual involvement with men.

In 1971, Fassbinder began a relationship with El Hedi ben Salem, a Moroccan Berber who had left his wife and five children the previous year, after meeting him at a gay bathhouse in Paris. Over the next three years, Salem appeared in several Fassbinder productions. His best-known role was as Ali in &quot;&quot; (1974). Their three-year relationship was punctuated with jealousy, violence and heavy drug and alcohol use. Fassbinder finally ended the relationship in 1974, due to Salem&#x27;s chronic alcoholism and tendency to become violent when he drank. Shortly after the breakup, Salem stabbed three people (none fatally) in Berlin and had to be smuggled out of the city. Salem eventually made his way to France where he was arrested and imprisoned. He hanged himself while in custody in 1977. News of Salem&#x27;s suicide was kept from Fassbinder for years. He eventually found out about his former lover&#x27;s death shortly before his own death in 1982 and dedicated his last film, &quot;Querelle&quot;, to Salem.

Fassbinder&#x27;s next lover was Armin Meier. Meier was a near-illiterate former butcher who had spent his early years in an orphanage. He also appeared in several Fassbinder films in this period. A glimpse into their troubled relationship can be seen in Fassbinder&#x27;s episode for &quot;Germany in Autumn&quot; (1978). Fassbinder ended the relationship in April 1978. During the week of Fassbinder&#x27;s birthday (31 May), Meier deliberately consumed four bottles of sleeping pills and alcohol in the kitchen of the apartment he and Fassbinder had previously shared. His body was found a week later.

In the last four years of Fassbinder&#x27;s life, his companion was Juliane Lorenz (born 1957), the editor of his films during the last years of his life. She can be seen in a small role as the film producer&#x27;s secretary in &quot;Veronika Voss&quot;. According to Lorenz, they considered getting married but never did so. Although they were reported as drifting apart in his last year, an accusation Lorenz has denied, they were still living together at the time of his death.

==Controversies==
Media scandals and controversies ensured that in Germany, Fassbinder was permanently in the news, making calculatedly provocative remarks in interviews. His work often received mixed reviews from the national critics, many of whom only began to take him seriously after the foreign press had hailed him as a major director.

There were frequent exposés of his lifestyle in the press, and attacks on all sides from the groups his films offended. His television series &quot;Eight Hours Don&#x27;t Make a Day&quot; was cut from eight to five episodes after pressure from conservatives. The playwright Franz Xaver Kroetz sued over Fassbinder&#x27;s adaptation of his play &quot;Jail Bait&quot;, alleging that it was obscene. Lesbians and feminists accused Fassbinder of misogyny (in presenting women as complicit in their own oppression) in his &#x27;Women&#x27;s Pictures&#x27;. &quot;The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant&quot; has been cited by some feminist and gay critics as both homophobic and sexist.

Gay critics also criticized &quot;Fox and His Friends&quot; for not positively depicting homosexuality in bourgeois society, feeling Fassbinder had betrayed them. Conservatives attacked him for his association with the far-left. Marxists said he had sold out his political principles in his depictions of left-intellectual manipulations in &quot;Mother Küsters&#x27; Trip to Heaven&quot; and of a late-blooming terrorist in &quot;The Third Generation&quot;. &quot;Berlin Alexanderplatz&quot; was moved to a late-night television slot amid widespread complaints that it was unsuitable for children. The most heated criticism came for his play &quot;Trash, the City and Death&quot;, whose scheduled performance at the Theater am Turm in Frankfurt was cancelled early in 1975 amid accusations of antisemitism. In the turmoil, Fassbinder resigned from his directorship of that prestigious theater complex, complaining that the play had been misinterpreted. The play is about an unscrupulous and very greedy Jewish businessman in Frankfurt who ruthlessly uses German guilt over the Holocaust to make himself rich. Though published at the time, and quickly withdrawn, the play was not performed until five years after Fassbinder&#x27;s death by Thieves Theatre in 1987 at ABC No Rio.

==Death==
By the time he made his last film, &quot;Querelle&quot; (1982), Fassbinder was consuming significant quantities of drugs and alcohol. On the night of 9–10 June 1982, Wolf Gremm, director of the film &quot;Kamikaze 1989&quot; (1982), which starred Fassbinder, was staying in his apartment. Early that evening, Fassbinder retired to his bedroom. He was working on notes for a future film, &quot;Rosa L&quot;, based on the life of Polish-German revolutionary socialist Rosa Luxemburg. Fassbinder was watching television while reading when, shortly after 1 am, he received a phone call from his friend and assistant Harry Baer. At 3:30 a.m, when Juliane Lorenz arrived home, she heard the noise of the television in Fassbinder&#x27;s room, but she could not hear him snoring. Though not allowed to enter the room uninvited, she went in, and discovered his lifeless body with a cigarette still between his lips. A thin ribbon of blood trickled from one nostril.

Fassbinder died from an overdose of cocaine and barbiturates. The notes for &quot;Rosa L&quot; were found next to his body. His remains were interred at Bogenhausener Friedhof in Munich.

<text>Alfred Adler ( ; ; 7 February 1870 – 28 May 1937) was an Austrian medical doctor, psychotherapist, and founder of the school of individual psychology. His emphasis on the importance of feelings of belonging, relationships within the family, and birth order set him apart from Freud and others in their common circle. He proposed that contributing to others (social interest or ) was how the individual feels a sense of worth and belonging in the family and society. His earlier work focused on inferiority, coining the term inferiority complex, an isolating element which he argued plays a key role in personality development. Alfred Adler considered a human being as an individual whole, and therefore he called his school of psychology &quot;individual psychology&quot;.

Adler was the first to emphasize the importance of the social element in the re-adjustment process of the individual and to carry psychiatry into the community. A &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot; survey, published in 2002, ranked Adler as the 67th most eminent psychologist of the 20th century.

== Early life ==
Adler was born on February 7, 1870 at Mariahilfer Straße 208 in Rudolfsheim, a village on the western fringes of Vienna, a modern part of Rudolfsheim-Fünfhaus, the 15th district of the city. He was second of the seven children of a Jewish couple, Pauline (Beer) and Leopold Adler. Leopold Adler was a Hungarian-born grain merchant. Leopold&#x27;s nephew was Victor Adler, a leader of the labour movement and founder of the Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party (SDAP). Alfred&#x27;s younger brother died in the bed next to him when Alfred was only three years old, and throughout his childhood, he maintained a rivalry with his older brother. This rivalry was spurred on because Adler believed his mother preferred his brother over him. Despite his good relationship with his father, he still struggled with feelings of inferiority in his relationship with his mother.

Alfred was an active, popular child and an average student who was also known for the competitive attitude toward his older brother, Sigmund. Early on, he developed rickets, which kept Alfred from walking until he was four years old. At the age of four, he developed pneumonia and heard a doctor say to his father, &quot;Your boy is lost&quot;. Along with being run over twice and witnessing his younger brother&#x27;s death, this sickness contributed to his overall fear of death. At that point, he decided to be a physician. He was very interested in the subjects of psychology, sociology and philosophy. After studying at the University of Vienna, he specialized as an eye doctor, and later in neurology and psychiatry.

== Career ==
Adler began his medical career as an ophthalmologist, but he soon switched to general practice, and established his surgery in a less affluent part of Vienna across from the Prater, a combination of amusement park and circus. His clients included circus people, and it has been suggested that the unusual strengths and weaknesses of the performers led to his insights into &quot;organ inferiorities&quot; and compensation.

In his early career, Adler wrote an article in defence of Freud&#x27;s theory after reading one of Freud&#x27;s most well known works, &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot;. In 1902, because of his supportive article, Adler received an invitation from Sigmund Freud to join an informal discussion group that included and Wilhelm Stekel. The group, the &quot;Wednesday Society&quot; (), met regularly on Wednesday evenings at Freud&#x27;s home and was the beginning of the psychoanalytic movement, expanding over time to include many more members. Each week a member would present a paper and after a short break of coffee and cakes, the group would discuss it. The main members were Otto Rank, Max Eitingon, Wilhelm Stekel, Karl Abraham, Hanns Sachs, Fritz Wittels, Max Graf, and Sandor Ferenczi. In 1908, Adler presented his paper, &quot;The aggressive instinct in life and in neurosis&quot;, at a time when Freud believed that early sexual development was the primary determinant of the making of character, with which Adler took issue. Adler proposed that the sexual and aggressive drives were &quot;two originally separate instincts which merge later on&quot;. Freud at the time disagreed with this idea.

When Freud in 1920 proposed his dual instinct theory of libido and aggressive drives in &quot;Beyond the Pleasure Principle&quot;, without citing Adler, he was reproached that Adler had proposed the aggressive drive in his 1908 paper (Eissler, 1971). Freud later commented in a 1923 footnote he added to the Little Hans case that, &quot;I have myself been obliged to assert the existence of an aggressive instinct&quot; (1909, p. 140, 2), while pointing out that his conception of an aggressive drive differs from that of Adler. A long-serving member of the group, he made many more beyond this 1908 pivotal contribution to the group, and Adler became president of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society eight years later (1910). He remained a member of the Society until 1911, when he and a group of his supporters formally disengaged from Freud&#x27;s circle, the first of the great dissenters from orthodox psychoanalysis (preceding Carl Jung&#x27;s split in 1914).

This departure suited both Freud and Adler, since they had grown to dislike each other. During his association with Freud, Adler frequently maintained his own ideas which often diverged from Freud&#x27;s. While Adler is often referred to as &quot;a pupil of Freud&quot;, in fact this was never true; they were colleagues, Freud referring to him in print in 1909 as &quot;My colleague Dr Alfred Adler&quot;. The association of Adler and Freud lasted a total of 9 years, and they never saw each other after the separation. Freud continued to dislike Adler even after the separation and tended to do so with other defectors from psychoanalysis. Even after Adler&#x27;s death, Freud maintained his distaste for him. When conversing with a colleague over the matter, he stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t understand your sympathy for Adler. For a Jewish boy out of a Viennese suburb a death in Aberdeen is an unheard of career in itself and a proof of how far he had got on. The world really rewarded him richly for his service in having contradicted psychoanalysis.&quot; In 1929 Adler showed a reporter with the &quot;New York Herald&quot; a copy of the faded postcard that Freud had sent him in 1902. He wanted to prove that he had never been a disciple of Freud&#x27;s but rather that Freud had sought him out to share his ideas.

Adler founded the Society for Individual Psychology in 1912 after his break from the psychoanalytic movement. Adler&#x27;s group initially included some orthodox Nietzschean adherents (who believed that Adler&#x27;s ideas on power and inferiority were closer to Nietzsche than Freud&#x27;s). Their enmity aside, Adler retained a lifelong admiration for Freud&#x27;s ideas on dreams and credited him with creating a scientific approach to their clinical utilization (Fiebert, 1997). Nevertheless, even regarding dream interpretation, Adler had his own theoretical and clinical approach. The primary differences between Adler and Freud centered on Adler&#x27;s contention that the social realm (exteriority) is as important to psychology as is the internal realm (interiority). The dynamics of power and compensation extend beyond sexuality, and gender and politics can be as important as libido. Moreover, Freud did not share Adler&#x27;s socialist beliefs, the latter&#x27;s wife being for example an intimate friend of many of the Russian Marxists such as Leon Trotsky.

In 1927, entrusted the founding of the Adler&#x27;s Society to Dimitrije Mitrinović, a Serbian philosopher, revolutionary and mystic.

In Berlin, in summer 1930, Adler met with English occultist Aleister Crowley. Their connection was through Karl Germer, a German and American businessman and occultist known as Frater Saturnus, who was one of Adler’s patients. Crowley later claimed to “know [Adler] personally” and even to have “handled” some of his Berlin patients and to have “put a lot of my own theory and practice into it.”

== The Adlerian school ==
Following Adler&#x27;s break from Freud, he enjoyed considerable success and celebrity in building an independent school of psychotherapy and a unique personality theory. He traveled and lectured for a period of 25 years promoting his socially oriented approach. His intent was to build a movement that would rival, even supplant, others in psychology by arguing for the holistic integrity of psychological well-being with that of social equality. Adler&#x27;s efforts were halted by World War I, during which he served as a doctor with the Austro-Hungarian Army. After the conclusion of the war, his influence increased greatly. In 1919, Adler started the first Child Guidance clinic in Vienna. With the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Social Democratic Party of Austria came to power in the newly-formed Austrian Republic. The Social Democrats supported welfare programs with a particular focus on childhood educational reform. The resulting climate enabled Adler and his associates to establish 28 child guidance clinics, and Vienna became the first city in the world to provide schoolchildren with free educational therapy.

At the same time, from 1921 onwards, Adler was a frequent lecturer in Europe and the United States, becoming a visiting professor at Columbia University in 1927. His clinical treatment methods for adults were aimed at uncovering the hidden purpose of symptoms using the therapeutic functions of insight and meaning.

Adler was concerned with the overcoming of the superiority/inferiority dynamic and was one of the first psychotherapists to discard the analytic couch in favor of two chairs. This allows the clinician and patient to sit together more or less as equals. Clinically, Adler&#x27;s methods are not limited to treatment after-the-fact but extend to the realm of prevention by preempting future problems in the child. Prevention strategies include encouraging and promoting social interest, belonging, and a cultural shift within families and communities that leads to the eradication of pampering and neglect (especially corporal punishment). Adler&#x27;s popularity was related to the comparative optimism and comprehensibility of his ideas. He often wrote for the lay public. Adler always retained a pragmatic approach that was task-oriented. These &quot;Life tasks&quot; are occupation/work, society/friendship, and love/sexuality. Their success depends on cooperation. The tasks of life are not to be considered in isolation since, as Adler famously commented, &quot;they all throw cross-lights on one another&quot;.

In his bestselling book, &quot;Man&#x27;s Search for Meaning&quot;, Dr. Viktor E. Frankl compared his own &quot;Third Viennese School of Psychotherapy&quot; (after Freud&#x27;s and Adler&#x27;s schools) to Adler&#x27;s analysis:

== Emigration ==
In the early 1930s, after most of Adler&#x27;s Austrian clinics had been closed due to his Jewish heritage (despite his conversion to Christianity), Adler left Austria for a professorship at the Long Island College of Medicine in the US, in 1934.

== Basic principles ==
Adler was influenced by the mental construct ideas of the philosopher Hans Vaihinger (&quot;The Philosophy of &#x27;As if&#x27;&quot;) and the literature of Dostoyevsky. While still a member of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society he developed a theory of organic inferiority and compensation that was the prototype for his later turn to phenomenology and the development of his famous concept, the inferiority complex.

Adler was also influenced by the philosophies of Immanuel Kant, Friedrich Nietzsche, Rudolf Virchow and the statesman Jan Smuts (who coined the term &quot;holism&quot;). Adler&#x27;s School, known as &quot;Individual Psychology&quot;—an arcane reference to the Latin &quot;individuals&quot; meaning indivisibility, a term intended to emphasize holism—is both a social and community psychology as well as a depth psychology. Adler was an early advocate in psychology for prevention and emphasized the training of parents, teachers, social workers and so on in democratic approaches that allow a child to exercise their power through reasoned decision making whilst co-operating with others. He was a social idealist, and was known as a socialist in his early years of association with psychoanalysis (1902–1911).

Adler was pragmatic and believed that lay people could make practical use of the insights of psychology. Adler was also an early supporter of feminism in psychology and the social world, believing that feelings of superiority and inferiority were often gendered and expressed symptomatically in characteristic masculine and feminine styles. These styles could form the basis of psychic compensation and lead to mental health difficulties. Adler also spoke of &quot;safeguarding tendencies&quot; and neurotic behavior long before Anna Freud wrote about the same phenomena in her book &quot;The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defense&quot;.

Adlerian-based scholarly, clinical and social practices focus on the following topics:
* Social interest and community feeling
* Holism and the creative self
* Fictional finalism, teleology, and goal constructs
* Psychological and social encouragement
* Inferiority, superiority and compensation
* Life style/style of life
* Early recollections (a projective technique)
* Family constellation and birth order
* Life tasks and social embeddedness
* The conscious and unconscious realms
* Private logic and common sense (based in part on Kant&#x27;s &quot;&quot;)
* Symptoms and neurosis
* Safeguarding behavior
* Guilt and guilt feelings
* Socratic questioning
* Dream interpretation
* Child and adolescent psychology
* Democratic approaches to parenting and families
* Adlerian approaches to classroom management
* Leadership and organizational psychology

Adler created Adlerian Therapy, because he believed that one&#x27;s psyche should be studied in the context of that person&#x27;s environment.

=== Adler&#x27;s approach to personality ===
In one of his earliest and most famous publications, &quot;Study of Organ Inferiority and Its Psychical Compensation,&quot; Adler outlined the basics for what would be the beginning foundation of his personality theory. The article focuses mainly on the topics of organ inferiority and compensation. Organ inferiority is when one organ, or portion of the body, is weaker than the rest. Adler postulated that the body&#x27;s other organs would work together in order to compensate for the weakness of this &quot;inferior&quot; organ. When compensation occurs, other areas of the body make up for the function lacking in the inferior portion. In some cases, the weakness may be overcompensated transforming it into a strength. An example would be an individual with a weak leg becoming a great runner later on. As his theory progressed, the idea of organ inferiority was replaced with feelings of inferiority instead. As Adler&#x27;s theory progressed, he continued evolving his theory and key ideas.

Adler&#x27;s book, (&quot;The Neurotic Character&quot;) defines his earlier key ideas. He argued that human personality could be explained teleologically: parts of the individual&#x27;s unconscious self ideally work to convert feelings of inferiority to superiority (or rather completeness). The desires of the self ideal were countered by social and ethical demands. If the corrective factors were disregarded and the individual overcompensated, then an inferiority complex would occur, fostering the danger of the individual becoming egocentric, power-hungry and aggressive or worse.

Common therapeutic tools include the use of humor, historical instances, and paradoxical injunctions.

=== Psychodynamics and teleology ===
Adler maintained that human psychology is psychodynamic in nature. Unlike Freud&#x27;s metapsychology that emphasizes instinctual demands, human psychology is guided by goals and fueled by a yet unknown creative force. Like Freud&#x27;s instincts, Adler&#x27;s fictive goals are largely unconscious. These goals have a &quot;teleological&quot; function. Constructivist Adlerians, influenced by neo-Kantian and Nietzschean ideas, view these &quot;teleological&quot; goals as &quot;fictions&quot; in the sense that Hans Vaihinger spoke of (&quot;fictio&quot;). Usually there is a fictional final goal which can be deciphered alongside of innumerable sub-goals. The inferiority/superiority dynamic is constantly at work through various forms of compensation and overcompensation. For example, in anorexia nervosa the fictive final goal is to &quot;be perfectly thin&quot; (overcompensation on the basis of a feeling of inferiority). Hence, the fictive final goal can serve a persecutory function that is ever-present in subjectivity (though its trace springs are usually unconscious). The end goal of being &quot;thin&quot; is fictive, however, since it can never be subjectively achieved.

Teleology serves another vital function for Adlerians. Chilon&#x27;s &quot;hora telos&quot; (&quot;see the end, consider the consequences&quot;) provides for both healthy and maladaptive psychodynamics. Here we also find Adler&#x27;s emphasis on personal responsibility in mentally healthy subjects who seek their own and the social good.

=== Constructivism and metaphysics ===
As a psychodynamic system, Adlerians excavate the past of a client/patient in order to alter their future and increase integration into community in the &#x27;here-and-now&#x27;. The &#x27;here-and-now&#x27; aspects are especially relevant to those Adlerians who emphasize humanism and/or existentialism in their approaches.

=== Holism ===
Metaphysical Adlerians emphasize a spiritual holism in keeping with what Jan Smuts articulated (Smuts coined the term &quot;holism&quot;), that is, the spiritual sense of one-ness that holism usually implies (etymology of holism: from ὅλος holos, a Greek word meaning all, entire, total) Smuts believed that evolution involves a progressive series of lesser wholes integrating into larger ones. Whilst Smuts&#x27; text &quot;Holism and Evolution&quot; is thought to be a work of science, it actually attempts to unify evolution with a higher metaphysical principle (holism). The sense of connection and one-ness revered in various religious traditions (among these, Christianity, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Islam, Buddhism and Baha&#x27;i) finds a strong complement in Adler&#x27;s thought.

The pragmatic and materialist aspects to contextualizing members of communities, the construction of communities and the socio-historical-political forces that shape communities matter a great deal when it comes to understanding an individual&#x27;s psychological make-up and functioning. This aspect of Adlerian psychology holds a high level of synergy with the field of community psychology, especially given Adler&#x27;s concern for what he called &quot;the absolute truth and logic of communal life&quot;. However, Adlerian psychology, unlike community psychology, is holistically concerned with both prevention and clinical treatment after-the-fact. Hence, Adler can be considered the &quot;first community psychologist&quot;, a discourse that formalized in the decades following Adler&#x27;s death (King &amp; Shelley, 2008).

Adlerian psychology, Carl Jung&#x27;s analytical psychology, Gestalt therapy and Karen Horney&#x27;s psychodynamic approach are holistic schools of psychology. These discourses eschew a reductive approach to understanding human psychology and psychopathology.

=== Typology ===
Adler developed a scheme of so-called personality types, which were however always to be taken as provisional or since he did not, in essence, believe in personality types, and at different times proposed different and equally tentative systems. The danger with typology is to lose sight of the individual&#x27;s uniqueness and to gaze reductively, acts that Adler opposed. Nevertheless, he intended to illustrate patterns that could denote a characteristic governed under the overall style of life. Hence American Adlerians such as Harold Mosak have made use of Adler&#x27;s typology in this provisional sense:
* The Getting or Leaning They are sensitive people who have developed a shell around themselves which protects them, but they must rely on others to carry them through life&#x27;s difficulties. They have low energy levels and so become dependent. When overwhelmed, they develop what we typically think of as neurotic symptoms: phobias, obsessions and compulsions, general anxiety, hysteria, amnesias, and so on, depending on individual details of their lifestyle.
* The Avoiding types are those that hate being defeated. They may be successful, but have not taken any risks getting there. They are likely to have low social contact in fear of rejection or defeat in any way.
* The Ruling or Dominant type strive for power and are willing to manipulate situations and people, anything to get their way. People of this type are also prone to anti-social behavior.
* The Socially Useful types are those who are very outgoing and very active. They have a lot of social contact and strive to make changes for the good.

These &#x27;types&#x27; are typically formed in childhood and are expressions of the Style of Life.

=== The importance of memories ===
Adler placed great emphasis upon the interpretation of early memories in working with patients and school children, writing that, &quot;Among all psychic expressions, some of the most revealing are the individual&#x27;s memories.&quot; Adler viewed memories as expressions of &quot;private logic&quot; and as metaphors for an individual&#x27;s personal philosophy of life or &quot;lifestyle&quot;. He maintained that memories are never incidental or trivial; rather, they are chosen reminders: &quot;(A person&#x27;s) memories are the reminders she carries about with her of her limitations and of the meanings of events. There are no &#x27;chance&#x27; memories. Out of the incalculable number of impressions that an individual receives, she chooses to remember only those which she considers, however dimly, to have a bearing on her problems.&quot;

=== On birth order ===
Adler often emphasized one&#x27;s psychological birth order as having an influence on the style of life and the strengths and weaknesses in one&#x27;s psychological make up. Birth order referred to the placement of siblings within the family. It is important to note the difference between psychological and ordinal birth order (e.g. in some families, a second child might behave like a firstborn, in which case they are considered to be an ordinal secondborn but a psychological firstborn). Mosak, H.H. &amp; Maniacci, M. P. (1999). A primer of Adlerian Psychology. Taylor and Francis. Adler believed that the firstborn child would be in a favorable position, enjoying the full attention of the eager new parents until the arrival of a second child. This second child would cause the first born to suffer feelings of dethronement, no longer being the center of attention. Adler (1908) believed that in a three-child family, the oldest child would be the most likely to suffer from neuroticism and substance addiction which he reasoned was a compensation for the feelings of excessive responsibility &quot;the weight of the world on one&#x27;s shoulders&quot; (e.g. having to look after the younger ones) and the melancholic loss of that once supremely pampered position. As a result, he predicted that this child was the most likely to end up in jail or an asylum. Youngest children would tend to be overindulged, leading to poor social empathy. Consequently, the middle child, who would experience neither dethronement nor overindulgence, was most likely to develop into a successful individual yet also most likely to be a rebel and to feel squeezed-out. Adler himself was the third (some sources credit second) in a family of six children.

Adler never produced any scientific support for his interpretations on birth order roles, nor did he feel the need to. Yet the value of the hypothesis was to extend the importance of siblings in marking the psychology of the individual beyond Freud&#x27;s more limited emphasis on the mother and father. Hence, Adlerians spend time therapeutically mapping the influence that siblings (or lack thereof) had on the psychology of their clients. The idiographic approach entails an excavation of the phenomenology of one&#x27;s birth order position for likely influence on the subject&#x27;s Style of Life. In sum, the subjective experiences of sibling positionality and inter-relations are important in terms of the dynamics of psychology, for Adlerian therapists and personality theorists, not the cookbook predictions that may or may not have been objectively true in Adler&#x27;s time.

For Adler, birth order answered the question, &quot;Why do children, who are raised in the same family, grow up with very different personalities?&quot; While a strict geneticist, believing siblings are raised in a shared environment, may claim any differences in personality would be caused by subtle variations in the individuals&#x27; genetics, Adler showed through his birth order theory that children do not grow up in the same shared environment, but the oldest child grows up in a family where they have younger siblings, the middle child with older and younger siblings, and the youngest with older siblings. The position in the family constellation, Adler said, is the reason for these differences in personality and not genetics: a point later taken up by Eric Berne.

=== On addiction ===
Adler&#x27;s insight into birth order, compensation and issues relating to the individuals&#x27; perception of community also led him to investigate the causes and treatment of substance abuse disorders, particularly alcoholism and morphinism, which already were serious social problems of his time. Adler&#x27;s work with addicts was significant since most other prominent proponents of psychoanalysis invested relatively little time and thought into these widespread ills of the modern and post-modern age. In addition to applying his individual psychology approach of organ inferiority, for example, to the onset and causes of addictive behaviors, he also tried to find a clear relationship of drug cravings to sexual gratification or their substitutions. Early pharmaco-therapeutic interventions with non-addictive substances, such as neuphyllin were used, since withdrawal symptoms were explained by a form of &quot;water-poisoning&quot; that made the use of diuretics necessary.

Adler and his wife&#x27;s pragmatic approach, and the seemingly high success rates of their treatment were based on their ideas of social functioning and well-being. Clearly, life style choices and situations were emphasized, for example the need for relaxation or the negative effects of early childhood conflicts were examined, which compared to other authoritarian or religious treatment regimens, were clearly modern approaches. Certainly some of his observations, for example that psychopaths were more likely to be drug addicts are not compatible with current methodologies and theories of substance abuse treatment, but the self-centered attributes of the illness and the clear escapism from social responsibilities by pathological addicts put Adler&#x27;s treatment modalities clearly into a modern contextual reasoning.

=== On homosexuality ===

Adler&#x27;s ideas regarding non-heterosexual sexuality and various social forms of deviance have long been controversial. Along with prostitution and criminality, Adler had classified &#x27;homosexuals&#x27; as falling among the &quot;failures of life&quot;. In 1917, he began his writings on homosexuality with a 52-page magazine, and sporadically published more thoughts throughout the rest of his life.

The Dutch psychologist Gerard J. M. van den Aardweg underlines how Alfred Adler came to his conclusions for, in 1917, Adler believed that he had established a connection between homosexuality and an inferiority complex towards one&#x27;s own gender. This point of view differed from Freud&#x27;s theory that homosexuality is rooted in narcissism or Jung&#x27;s view of expressions of contrasexuality vis-à-vis the archetypes of the Anima and Animus.

There is evidence that Adler may have moved towards abandoning the hypothesis. Towards the end of Adler&#x27;s life, in the mid-1930s, his opinion towards homosexuality began to shift. Elizabeth H. McDowell, a New York state family social worker recalls undertaking supervision with Adler on a young man who was &quot;living in sin&quot; with an older man in New York City. Adler asked her, &quot;Is he happy, would you say?&quot; &quot;Oh yes,&quot; McDowell replied. Adler then stated, &quot;Well, why don&#x27;t we leave him alone.&quot;

According to the novelist Phyllis Bottome, who wrote Adler&#x27;s &quot;Biography&quot; (after Adler himself laid upon her that task): &quot;He always treated homosexuality as lack of courage. These were but ways of obtaining a slight release for a physical need while avoiding a greater obligation. A transient partner of your own sex is a better known road and requires less courage than a permanent contact with an &quot;unknown&quot; sex... Adler taught that men cannot be judged from within by their &quot;possessions,&quot; as he used to call nerves, glands, traumas, drives et cetera, since both judge and prisoner are liable to misconstrue what is invisible and incalculable; but that he can be judged, with no danger from introspection, by how he measures up to the three common life tasks set before every human being between the cradle and the grave: work (employment), love or marriage (intimacy), and social contact (friendships.)&quot;

=== Parent education ===
Adler emphasized both treatment and prevention. With regard to psychodynamic psychology, Adlerians emphasize the foundational importance of childhood in developing personality and any tendency towards various forms of psychopathology. The best way to inoculate against what are now termed &quot;personality disorders&quot; (what Adler had called the &quot;neurotic character&quot;), or a tendency to various neurotic conditions (depression, anxiety, etc.), is to train a child to be and feel an equal part of the family. The responsibility of the optimal development of the child is not limited to the mother or father, but rather includes teachers and society more broadly. Adler argued therefore that teachers, nurses, social workers, and so on require training in parent education to complement the work of the family in fostering a democratic character. When a child does not feel equal and is enacted upon (abused through pampering or neglect) he or she is likely to develop inferiority or superiority complexes and various concomitant compensation strategies. These strategies exact a social toll by seeding higher divorce rates, the breakdown of the family, criminal tendencies, and subjective suffering in the various guises of psychopathology. Adlerians have long promoted parent education groups, especially those influenced by the famous Austrian/American Adlerian Rudolf Dreikurs (Dreikurs &amp; Soltz, 1964).
=== Spirituality, ecology and community ===
In a late work, &quot;Social Interest: A Challenge to Mankind&quot; (1938), Adler turns to the subject of metaphysics, where he integrates Jan Smuts&#x27; evolutionary holism with the ideas of teleology and community: &quot;sub specie aeternitatis&quot;. Unabashedly, he argues his vision of society: &quot;Social feeling means above all a struggle for a communal form that must be thought of as eternally applicable... when humanity has attained its goal of perfection... an ideal society amongst all mankind, the ultimate fulfillment of evolution.&quot; Adler follows this pronouncement with a defense of metaphysics:

This social feeling for Adler is &quot;Gemeinschaftsgefühl&quot;, a community feeling whereby one feels he or she belongs with others and has also developed an ecological connection with nature (plants, animals, the crust of this earth) and the cosmos as a whole, sub specie aeternitatis. Clearly, Adler himself had little problem with adopting a metaphysical and spiritual point of view to support his theories.

==Use of Adler&#x27;s work without attribution==
Much of Adler&#x27;s theories have been absorbed into modern psychology without attribution. Psychohistorian Henri F. Ellenberger writes, &quot;It would not be easy to find another author from which so much has been borrowed on all sides without acknowledgement than Alfred Adler.&quot; Ellenberger posits several theories for &quot;the discrepancy between greatness of achievement, massive rejection of person and work, and wide-scale, quiet plagiarism...&quot; These include Adler&#x27;s &quot;imperfect&quot; style of writing and demeanor, his &quot;capacity to create a new obviousness,&quot; and his lack of a large and well organized following.

==Influence on depth psychology==
In collaboration with Sigmund Freud and a small group of Freud&#x27;s colleagues, Adler was among the co-founders of the psychoanalytic movement and a core member of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society: indeed, to Freud he was &quot;the only personality there&quot;. He was the first major figure to break away from psychoanalysis to form an independent school of psychotherapy and personality theory, which he called individual psychology because he believed a human to be an indivisible whole, an &quot;individuum&quot;. He also imagined a person to be connected or associated with the surrounding world.

This was after Freud declared Adler&#x27;s ideas as too contrary, leading to an ultimatum to all members of the Society (which Freud had shepherded) to drop Adler or be expelled, disavowing the right to dissent (Makari, 2008). Nevertheless, Freud always took Adler&#x27;s ideas seriously, calling them &quot;honorable errors&quot;. Following this split, Adler would come to have an enormous, independent effect on the disciplines of counseling and psychotherapy as they developed over the course of the 20th century (Ellenberger, 1970). He influenced notable figures in subsequent schools of psychotherapy such as Rollo May, Viktor Frankl, Abraham Maslow and Albert Ellis. His writings preceded, and were at times surprisingly consistent with, later Neo-Freudian insights such as those evidenced in the works of Otto Rank, Karen Horney, Harry Stack Sullivan and Erich Fromm, some considering that it would take several decades for Freudian ego psychology to catch up with Adler&#x27;s ground-breaking approach.

Adler emphasized the importance of equality in preventing various forms of psychopathology, and espoused the development of social interest and democratic family structures for raising children. His most famous concept is the inferiority complex which speaks to the problem of self-esteem and its negative effects on human health (e.g. sometimes producing a paradoxical superiority striving). His emphasis on power dynamics is rooted in the philosophy of Nietzsche, whose works were published a few decades before Adler&#x27;s. Specifically, Adler&#x27;s conceptualization of the &quot;Will to Power&quot; focuses on the individual&#x27;s creative power to change for the better. Adler argued for holism, viewing the individual holistically rather than reductively, the latter being the dominant lens for viewing human psychology. Adler was also among the first in psychology to argue in favor of feminism, and the female analyst, making the case that power dynamics between men and women (and associations with masculinity and femininity) are crucial to understanding human psychology (Connell, 1995). Adler is considered, along with Freud and Jung, to be one of the three founding figures of depth psychology, which emphasizes the unconscious and psychodynamics (Ellenberger, 1970; Ehrenwald, 1991). He is also considered by some to be one of the greatest psychologists and philosophers of the twentieth century.

== Personal life ==
During his college years, he had become attached to a group of socialist students, among which he had found his wife-to-be, Raissa Timofeyewna Epstein, an intellectual and social activist from Russia studying in Vienna. Because Raissa was a militant socialist, she had a large impact on Adler&#x27;s early publications and ultimately his theory of personality. They married in 1897 and had four children, two of whom, his daughter Alexandra and his son Kurt, became psychiatrists. Their children were writer, psychiatrist and Socialist activist Alexandra Adler; psychiatrist Kurt Adler; writer and activist Valentine Adler; and Cornelia &quot;Nelly&quot; Adler. Raissa, Adler&#x27;s wife, died at 89 in New York City on April 21, 1962.

Author and journalist Margot Adler (1946–2014) was Adler&#x27;s granddaughter.

== Death and cremation ==
Adler died from a heart attack in 1937 in Aberdeen, Scotland, during a lecture tour. While walking down a street, Adler was seen to collapse and lie motionless on the pavement. As a man ran over to him and loosened his collar, Adler mumbled &quot;Kurt&quot;, the name of his son, and died. The autopsy performed determined his death was caused by a degeneration of the heart muscle. His body was cremated at Warriston Crematorium in Edinburgh but the ashes were never reclaimed. In 2007, his ashes were rediscovered in a casket at Warriston Crematorium and returned to Vienna for burial in 2011. His death was a temporary blow to the influence of his ideas, although a number of them were subsequently taken up by neo-Freudians. Through the work of Rudolf Dreikurs in the United States and many other adherents worldwide, Adlerian ideas and approaches remain strong and viable more than 80 years after Adler&#x27;s death.

== Legacy ==
Around the world there are various organizations promoting Adler&#x27;s orientation towards mental and social well-being. These include the International Committee of Adlerian Summer Schools and Institutes (ICASSI), the North American Society of Adlerian Psychology (NASAP) and the International Association for Individual Psychology. Teaching institutes and programs exist in Austria, Canada, England, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Switzerland, the United States, Jamaica, Peru, and Wales.

== Artistic and cultural references ==
The two main characters in the novel &quot;Plant Teacher&quot; engage in a session of Adlerian lifestyle interpretation, including early memory interpretation.

In the episode Something About Dr. Mary of the television series &quot;Frasier&quot;, Frasier recalls having to &quot;pass under a dangerously unbalanced portrait of Alfred Adler&quot; during his studies at Harvard.

He appears as a character in the &quot;Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot;.

The area was inhabited for around 8,000 years by Native Americans of the Fernandeño-Tataviam and Chumash-Venturaño tribes, who lived in the Santa Monica Mountains and Simi Hills and close to the Arroyo Calabasas (Calabasas Creek) tributary of the Los Angeles River in present-day Woodland Hills. The first Europeans to enter the San Fernando Valley were the Portola Expedition in 1769, exploring Alta California for Spanish mission and settlement locations. Seeing it from present-day Sepulveda Pass, the oak savanna inspired them to call the area &quot;El Valle de Santa Catalina de Bononia de Los Encinos&quot; (Valley of St. Catherine of Bononia of the Oaks). The Mission San Fernando Rey de España (Mission San Fernando) was established in 1797 and controlled the valley&#x27;s land, including future Woodland Hills.

Ownership of the southern half of the valley, south of present-day Roscoe Boulevard from Toluca Lake to Woodland Hills, by Americans began in the 1860s. First, Isaac Lankershim (as the &quot;San Fernando Farm Homestead Association&quot;) in 1869, then Isaac Lankershim&#x27;s son, James Boon Lankershim, and Isaac Newton Van Nuys (as the &quot;Los Angeles Farm &amp; Milling Company&quot;) in 1873, and finally, in the &quot;biggest land transaction ever recorded in Los Angeles County&quot;, a syndicate led by Harry Chandler of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; with Hobart Johnstone Whitley, Gen. Moses Sherman, and others (as the Los Angeles Suburban Homes Company) in 1910.
Victor Girard Kleinberger bought in the area from Chandler&#x27;s group and founded the town of Girard in 1922. He sought to attract residents and businesses by developing an infrastructure, advertising in newspapers, and planting 120,000 trees. His 300 pepper trees, forming a canopy over Canoga Avenue between Ventura Boulevard and Saltillo Street, became Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument #93 in 1972. the area was described as &quot;A small business district on Ventura Boulevard at Topanga Canyon Junction. The population is scattered, being found mostly throughout the surrounding agricultural country.&quot; The community of Girard was eventually incorporated into Los Angeles, and in 1945, it became known as Woodland Hills. Reference to the founding of Girard is part of the story arc in the first season of &quot;Perry Mason&quot; (2020).

<doc id="81596" wikidata="Q12389" url="?curid=81596" title="Donkey Kong (character)">
<text>often shortened to DK, is a character created by the Japanese game designer Shigeru Miyamoto. One of the flagship characters of the Japanese video game company Nintendo, he is the star of the &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; franchise and also features in the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise. Donkey Kong is a large, powerful gorilla who leads the Kongs, a family of various primates. He is stubborn and buffoonish, and throws barrels to attack or uncover power-ups. He wears a red necktie bearing his initials and is accompanied by supporting characters such as his sidekick Diddy Kong, girlfriend Candy Kong, and archenemy King K. Rool.

Donkey Kong debuted as the antagonist of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, a 1981 platform game. Miyamoto created him to replace the &quot;Popeye&quot; character Bluto after Nintendo was unable to obtain the license. Miyamoto designed him as a dumb, humorous antagonist, named &quot;donkey&quot; to convey &quot;stubborn&quot; and &quot;kong&quot; to imply &quot;gorilla&quot;, and drew inspiration from the fairy tale &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and the 1933 film &quot;King Kong&quot;. The Rare developer Kevin Bayliss redesigned Donkey Kong as a 3D model for &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; (1994); Nintendo has used the Bayliss design since. 

Donkey Kong has appeared in many video games, including the original &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; arcade games, the &quot;Country&quot; series of side-scrolling platform games, &quot;Mario&quot; games such as &quot;Mario Kart&quot; and &quot;Mario Party&quot;, and the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series of crossover fighting games. The 1981 game characterized Donkey Kong as Mario&#x27;s rebellious pet ape, while games since &quot;Country&quot; feature him as a protagonist and player character who seeks to protect his stash of bananas. Outside of games, Donkey Kong has appeared in animation, comics, children&#x27;s books, Super Nintendo World theme park attractions, and merchandise such as Lego construction toys. He has been voiced by Takashi Nagasako in games since 2004, and was voiced by Richard Yearwood in the television series &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; (1997–2000) and by Seth Rogen in &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot; (2023).

Donkey Kong is a pop culture icon and is frequently listed among the greatest video game characters. He is one of Nintendo&#x27;s most enduring characters; the &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; franchise was Nintendo&#x27;s first major international success, established it as a prominent force in the video game industry, and remains one of Nintendo&#x27;s bestselling franchises. Donkey Kong has also been the subject of analysis regarding his similarities to King Kong—which sparked the 1983 &quot;Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co., Ltd.&quot; lawsuit—his gender role, and his transition from villain to hero.

==Character==
Donkey Kong, also known by his initials DK, is the star of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, a video game series and media franchise owned by the Japanese video game company Nintendo. One of Nintendo&#x27;s flagship characters, he also appears in the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise; he is a playable character in most &quot;Mario Kart&quot; and &quot;Mario Party&quot; games and in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series of crossover fighting games. He makes cameo appearances in other Nintendo franchises, such as &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot;.

Donkey Kong first appeared as the antagonist of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, a 1981 arcade game; he is Mario&#x27;s rebellious pet gorilla who kidnaps his girlfriend Pauline and climbs a construction site. He appeared as a captive in the sequel, &quot;Donkey Kong Jr.&quot; (1982), in which he must be rescued by his son Donkey Kong Jr., and returned as the antagonist in &quot;Donkey Kong 3&quot; (1983) and &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; (1994). From 1994, &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; games were developed by the British studio Rare until its acquisition by the Nintendo competitor Microsoft in 2002. Rare&#x27;s 1994 Super Nintendo Entertainment System game &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; recast Donkey Kong as the protagonist. He has largely been portrayed as heroic since, though he occasionally appears as a villain, such as in &quot;Mario vs. Donkey Kong&quot; (2004).

Donkey Kong is a large and powerful gorilla who leads the Kongs, a family of various primates. He resides in a city in early &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; games, but the Rare games moved his residence to Donkey Kong Island, an idyllic isle. Donkey Kong weighs 800 pounds, and since 1994, has been depicted wearing a red necktie bearing his initials. Although Donkey Kong was introduced as an antagonist, he is not evil. &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot; noted that, unlike the &quot;Mario&quot; villains Bowser and Wario, Donkey Kong&#x27;s villainous acts are the result of jealous temper tantrums rather than malice. He is stubborn, buffoonish, and innocent, and strives to help others and be accepted. He protects his stash of bananas from enemies such as the Kremlings, a crocodile army led by his archenemy King K. Rool, and the Tiki Tak Tribe, a race of floating masks. Donkey Kong is frequently accompanied by his nephew and sidekick Diddy Kong, and his girlfriend, Candy Kong.

In his playable appearances, Donkey Kong is a heavyweight. He throws barrels to impede the player&#x27;s progress in the 1981 game. This trait is retained in his playable appearances, whereby he uses barrels as weapons or to uncover power-ups. Donkey Kong&#x27;s other abilities include slapping the ground, rolling, clinging onto and climbing surfaces, and swinging on vines. He rides vehicles such as minecarts and barrel-shaped rockets, and animals such as Rambi the Rhino and Enguarde the Swordfish. In &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot;, Donkey Kong has slow but powerful attacks such as a chargeable punch and a headbutt, with &quot;IGN&quot; likening him to &quot;Street Fighter&quot; Zangief.

===In other media===
A &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; cartoon produced by Ruby-Spears aired as part of CBS&#x27;s hour-long &quot;Saturday Supercade&quot; programming block in 1983. It follows Mario and Pauline as they attempt to capture Donkey Kong after he escapes from a circus. Donkey Kong also featured in &quot;Captain N: The Game Master&quot;, a DIC Entertainment series that ran on NBC for 34 episodes between 1989 and 1991. He interacts with other Nintendo Entertainment System characters such as &quot;Castlevania&quot; Simon Belmont. The computer-animated &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; (1997–2000), a sitcom, follows Donkey Kong as he attempts to protect a magical artifact, the Crystal Coconut, from King K. Rool.

Donkey Kong is a major character in &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot; (2023), an animated film produced by Nintendo, Illumination, and Universal Pictures. Mario and Princess Peach seek the Kongs&#x27; help to stop Bowser from invading the Mushroom Kingdom. The Kongs agree to help after Mario defeats Donkey Kong in an arena fight. Mario and Donkey Kong begin as foes, but learn they both want the respect of their fathers, and Donkey Kong participates in the final battle against Bowser.

Appearances in printed media include &quot;Blip&quot;, a short-lived American comic book published by Marvel Comics in 1983, a &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; comic published by the British comics publisher Fleetway Publications in 1995, and children&#x27;s book adaptations of the &quot;Country&quot; games by Michael Teitelbaum. Donkey Kong appears on Nintendo merchandise, including clothing, toys such as plushes and Amiibo figures, and trading cards. The Lego Group introduced a Donkey Kong Lego figure in a series of &quot;Country&quot; Lego Super Mario sets in 2023. Donkey Kong also features in the &quot;Country&quot;-themed area at Universal Studios&#x27; Super Nintendo World, which opened in 2024. Visitors may take pictures with a Donkey Kong mascot.

===Cranky Kong===
&quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; establishes that &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; is a hereditary title and that the Donkey Kong introduced in the Rare games is separate from the arcade games. The original Donkey Kong appears as a grumpy, elderly gorilla. Cranky Kong provides scathing, fourth wall-breaking humor, unfavorably comparing games to older ones such as the original &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;. His wife, Wrinkly Kong, was introduced in &quot;Donkey Kong Country 2&quot; (1995) and is killed off as a joke in &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; (1999), appearing in subsequent games as a ghost.

In most games, Cranky appears as a non-player character who provides hints or sells items. He is playable in &quot;Tropical Freeze&quot;, in which he can use his cane to bounce on enemies and obstacles. Cranky also appears in spin-offs such as the &quot;Donkey Konga&quot; games and &quot;Donkey Kong Barrel Blast&quot; (2007), and as a supporting character in &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot;. On February 20, 2014, to promote &quot;Tropical Freeze&quot;, Nintendo pretended to have Cranky take over its Twitter account, tweeting wisecracks and image macros.

The Rare &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; games referred to Cranky Kong as both Donkey Kong&#x27;s father and grandfather, which the developer Gregg Mayles suggested was due to his senility. While Nintendo often referred to Cranky as Donkey Kong&#x27;s grandfather after Rare&#x27;s acquisition by Microsoft, &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot; identifies him as Donkey Kong&#x27;s father. Journalists have noted that the inconsistency makes it unclear if the modern Donkey Kong is intended to be an adult Donkey Kong Jr., who does not appear in the &quot;Country&quot; games.

==Development==
===Conception===
In 1980, the commercial failure of Nintendo&#x27;s arcade game &quot;Radar Scope&quot; put the newly established subsidiary Nintendo of America in a financial crisis. Its founder, Minoru Arakawa, asked his father in-law, the Nintendo CEO Hiroshi Yamauchi, to provide a game that could repurpose the unsold &quot;Radar Scope&quot; cabinets. Most of Nintendo&#x27;s top developers were preoccupied, so the task went to Shigeru Miyamoto, a first-time game designer. Miyamoto found most arcade games of the time dull and wanted to make one that told a story, drawing from his favorite media such as the Shakespeare play &quot;Macbeth&quot;, the fairy tale &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, and the 1933 film &quot;King Kong&quot;.

Miyamoto devised a love triangle with the characters Popeye, Olive Oyl, and Bluto from the &quot;Popeye&quot; franchise, but a licensing deal between Nintendo and King Features fell through. Miyamoto created original characters to replace the &quot;Popeye&quot; ones; Mario and Pauline replaced Popeye and Olive Oyl, and Donkey Kong replaced Bluto. Like Bluto, Donkey Kong was a hairy, brutish character. Miyamoto chose a gorilla—an animal he found &quot;nothing too evil or repulsive&quot;—because he felt it made the scenario more interesting and humorous, and because gorillas are built similarly to humans. &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and &quot;King Kong&quot; influenced the choice.

Nintendo considered around 20 names for the character before settling on Donkey Kong, a name suggested by the export manager Shinichi Todori according to court documents. It is a common misconception that &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; is a mistranslation of &quot;Monkey Kong&quot;. &quot;Donkey&quot; was meant to convey &quot;stubborn&quot;, while &quot;kong&quot; is a generic term for &quot;gorilla&quot; in Japan. Miyamoto called him &quot;King Kong&quot; during development, as, in Japan, it was commonly used to refer to any large ape. One name, &quot;Funky Kong&quot;, was later used for a separate character in &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot;. Other names considered included &quot;Kong Dong&quot; and &quot;Kong Holiday&quot;. Nintendo of America objected to the name &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; because it did not believe that &quot;donkey&quot; could be used to describe an idiot, but Miyamoto liked how it sounded.

&quot;Donkey Kong&quot; popularity quickly led to the production of a sequel, &quot;Donkey Kong Jr.&quot; Miyamoto wanted to make Donkey Kong the player character, but the sprite graphic was too big to easily maneuver, so he created Donkey Kong Jr. The developers made Donkey Kong Mario&#x27;s captive so they could still feature him at the top of the screen. Donkey Kong first appeared as a protagonist in &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot;.

===Design===
Miyamoto designed Donkey Kong to appear dumb, as he saw him as a humorous rather than evil antagonist. In his mind, Donkey Kong&#x27;s motivation was not to hurt Pauline, but to retaliate against Mario, who mistreated him. With the exception of &quot;Donkey Kong 3&quot;, Donkey Kong&#x27;s character artwork during the 1980s generally portrayed him as likable, even as a villain. The 1994 Game Boy game was the first to depict Donkey Kong wearing a red tie with his initials. For &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot;, Rare&#x27;s Kevin Bayliss redesigned Donkey Kong. Bayliss was asked only to make him look more modern; he had no problems with the existing design, but was nonetheless excited to reinterpret him. 

Alongside the red tie from the Game Boy game, Bayliss gave Donkey Kong what &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; described as &quot;menacing, sunken eyes and [a] beak-like muzzle&quot;. Bayliss wanted a character that looked believable and could perform animations such as pounding his chest. His initial design was blocky and muscular to make Donkey Kong easy to animate, but became more cartoonish when Nintendo faxed reference material. Bayliss recycled the eye design from those of the Battletoads, characters he had previously designed for Rare. In retrospect, Bayliss felt this made it difficult for Donkey Kong to express emotions besides annoyance.

Miyamoto provided some suggestions, but otherwise left the specifics to Bayliss. &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; marked Donkey Kong&#x27;s first appearance as a 3D model, and the limitations of technology at the time influenced the redesign. Miyamoto asked that Donkey Kong have eyebrows and tangible fur, but both were infeasible. For the eyebrows, Rare compromised by making the area around Donkey Kong&#x27;s eyes black. Miyamoto suggested the tie to better convey Donkey Kong&#x27;s stubbornness. He felt Rare &quot;breathed new life into&quot; Donkey Kong and made him &quot;really cool&quot;, but also childish. Because real gorillas move slowly, Rare based Donkey Kong&#x27;s running animation on a horse&#x27;s gallop. Steve Mayles rendered Donkey Kong&#x27;s finalized 3D model in mid-1993.

Nintendo used the Bayliss design for decades in both &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; and &quot;Mario&quot; games. While Paon reintroduced elements of the arcade-era design for Donkey Kong&#x27;s appearance in &quot;DK: King of Swing&quot; (2004), subsequent games, including the sequel &quot;Donkey Kong: Jungle Climber&quot; (2007), did not. Donkey Kong underwent his first major redesign since &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; in 2022 for &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot;. The design, which combines elements of the Bayliss design with the original arcade-era one, features larger eyes, a less angular brow, lighter fur, and more realistic proportions. Another redesign, similar to the film design and artwork by Nintendo&#x27;s Shigehisa Nakaue, was revealed in 2025 and is set to debut in a future &quot;Mario Kart&quot; game.

===Voice===
In his early animated appearances, Donkey Kong was voiced by the comedian Soupy Sales and the actor Garry Chalk. Richard Yearwood voiced Donkey Kong in the &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; animated series, while Sterling Jarvis performed his singing voice. Yearwood reprised the role for a fan-made short film in 2023. Charles Martinet, who voiced Mario and other &quot;Mario&quot; characters until 2023, also voiced Donkey Kong for Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Mario in Real Time&quot; trade show attraction.

Donkey Kong does not have a consistent voice across games, and generally makes gorilla noises instead of speaking in full sentences. When developing &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot;, Rare planned to use real gorilla noises and visited the Twycross Zoo to record them. The composer David Wise described the visit as &quot;a complete waste of time&quot;. Outside of feeding times, the gorillas were too quiet, so a Rare staffer, Mark Betteridge, provided Donkey Kong&#x27;s voice. Grant Kirkhope provided the voice while composing music for &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot;. Kirkhope&#x27;s voice appeared in games such as &quot;Mario Kart: Double Dash&quot; (2003), the Game Boy Advance port of &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot;, and &quot;Mario vs. Donkey Kong&quot;. Takashi Nagasako is the most prolific Donkey Kong voice actor, having voiced him in 36 games as of 2025. He first provided it in &quot;Mario Power Tennis&quot; (2004).

The actor and comedian Seth Rogen voiced Donkey Kong in &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot;. Rogen, a fan of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; since childhood, used his regular speaking voice, as he felt the role did not require an unusual one. He said that, during casting, &quot;I was very clear that I don&#x27;t do voices. If you want me to be in this movie, then it&#x27;s going to sound like me and that&#x27;s it... I think in the film and in the game, all you seem to know about Donkey Kong is that he throws barrels and does not like Mario very much. And that&#x27;s what I ran with.&quot; The directors gave Rogen freedom to approach the role, and most of his directions were to yell and sound angry. Rogen enjoyed the role and expressed interest in reprising it.

==Themes and analysis==

Donkey Kong has been described as a parody of King Kong, with &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot; writing that the 1981 game&#x27;s scenario &quot;was almost a mockery of the premise of the [1933 &quot;King Kong&quot;] film&quot;. Whereas King Kong is fearsome, Donkey Kong is silly and foolish. The similarities sparked the 1983 &quot;Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co., Ltd.&quot; lawsuit, in which Universal alleged that &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; violated its trademark of &quot;King Kong&quot;. Robert W. Sweet ruled it was unlikely that anyone would confuse the two, as Donkey Kong was &quot;farcical, childlike and nonsexual&quot; compared to King Kong, &quot;a ferocious gorilla in quest of a beautiful woman&quot;. He noted stark contrasts between King Kong, who goes on bloody rampages and viciously attacks foes, and Donkey Kong, who bounces and struts to taunt the player and uses humorous obstacles such as cement tubs and pies.

The 1981 game features a simple damsel in distress narrative with traditional gender roles, which Miyamoto reused in his &quot;Super Mario&quot; and &quot;Legend of Zelda&quot; games. Donkey Kong, hypermasculine and brutish, kidnaps the passive Pauline, who must be rescued by the &quot;appropriately masculine&quot; hero, Mario. However, due to the cyclical nature of the gameplay, the masculine Mario is unsuccessful in defeating the hypermasculine Donkey Kong, who always recaptures Pauline. The Western New England University professor Edward Wesp found this makes Donkey Kong similar to the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; character Road Runner, with Mario akin to the perpetually failing Wile E. Coyote. Wesp writes that Mario&#x27;s &quot;determination and skill... will, in the end, fail to overcome [Donkey Kong]&#x27;s brutish power&quot;.

Games featuring Donkey Kong as a protagonist depict melodramatic adventures that emphasize action over characterization. In his initial appearance, Donkey Kong is similar to Nintendo villains such as &quot;Mario&quot; Bowser, &quot;Zelda&quot; Ganon, and &quot;Metroid&quot; Ridley, in that he is animalistic, unclothed, and unrelatable, much like the literary villains Caliban and Gollum. &quot;PopMatters&quot; observed that, in turning Donkey Kong into a protagonist, &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; &quot;domesticated&quot; him, adding the tie to clothe him and supporting Kongs to provide a family. The tie—as well as Donkey Kong&#x27;s contrast with the crocodilian King K. Rool, a more primitive animal—suggests Donkey Kong possesses sophistication and nobility and does not merely act upon impulse. The Kong family highlights that Donkey Kong cares for others and is past kidnapping. The player thus perceives him as selfless and admirable.

==Reception and legacy==
Donkey Kong has been described as one of the most iconic Nintendo mascots. In its 250th issue in January 2010, &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; named him their eighth-favorite Nintendo hero, describing him as goofy and entertaining. They also named him their eighth-favorite Nintendo villain, joking that one should avoid him if he is not wearing a tie. &quot;IGN&quot; criticized the tie, writing that &quot;DK needs a fashion makeover ... This guy used to be a working icon. Now his status is starting to show signs of rust.&quot; &quot;1UP.com&quot; named him the most &quot;Gracelessly Aging Character&quot;, citing the fact that the original Donkey Kong from the arcade game eventually became Cranky Kong. &quot;IGN&quot; ranked him 5th in their &quot;Top 100 Videogames Villains&quot; list for his earlier appearances. &quot;UGO.com&quot; listed Donkey Kong seventh on their list of &quot;The 25 Awesomest Hidden Characters&quot; for his cameo appearance in &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot;. &quot;Empire&quot; also included him on their list of the 50 greatest video game characters, adding that he is &quot;the worst named character in the history of gaming&quot;. The 2011 &quot;Guinness World Records Gamer&#x27;s Edition&quot; lists Donkey Kong as the 33rd-most popular video game character. In 2012, &quot;GamesRadar&quot; ranked him as the 25th-best hero in video games. Jeremy Parish of &quot;Polygon&quot; ranked 73 fighters from &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; &quot;from garbage to glorious&quot;, listing Donkey Kong as 22nd, stating that &quot;we&#x27;d love to play as Donkey Kong. This guy, though? He&#x27;s just the latter-day imposter version from &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; — the original DK&#x27;s son.&quot; Gavin Jasper of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; ranked Donkey Kong in 13th place of &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; characters, stating that &quot;DK is a blast to play as, especially when unleashing his ground-slap move in a match against seven opponents and everyone&#x27;s bouncing around like ping-pong balls. His wind-up punch is perfect, too&quot;. &quot;HobbyConsolas&quot; also included Donkey Kong on their &quot;The 30 best heroes of the last 30 years&quot;. According to Matt Reeves, the treacherous Koba-loyal apes in service of the Colonel in his 2017 film &quot;War for the Planet of the Apes&quot; are nicknamed &quot;donkeys&quot; in a reference both to Donkey Kong, and how they are used as &quot;pack mules&quot;.

<text>HPFS (High Performance File System) is a file system created specifically for the OS/2 operating system to improve upon the limitations of the FAT file system. It was written by Gordon Letwin and others at Microsoft and added to OS/2 version 1.2, at that time still a joint undertaking of Microsoft and IBM, and released in 1988.

== Overview ==
Compared with FAT, HPFS provided a number of additional capabilities:
*Support for mixed case file names, in different code pages
*Support for long file names (255 characters as opposed to FAT&#x27;s 8.3 naming scheme)
*More efficient use of disk space (files are not stored using multiple-sector clusters but on a per-sector basis)
*An internal architecture that keeps related items close to each other on the disk volume
*Less fragmentation of data
*Extent-based space allocation
*Separate datestamps for last modification, last access, and creation (as opposed to last-modification-only datestamp in then-times implementations of FAT)
*B+ tree structure for directories
*Root directory located at the midpoint, rather than at the beginning of the disk, for faster average access

HPFS also can keep 64 KB of metadata (&quot;extended attributes&quot;) per file.

IBM offers two kinds of IFS drivers for this file system:

*The standard one with a cache limited to 2 MB
*&quot;HPFS386&quot; provided with certain server versions of OS/2, or as added component for the server versions that did not come with it

HPFS386&#x27;s cache is limited by the amount of available memory in OS/2&#x27;s system memory arena and was implemented in 32-bit assembly language. HPFS386 is a ring 0 driver (allowing direct hardware access and direct interaction with the kernel) with built-in SMB networking properties that are usable by various server daemons, whereas HPFS is a ring 3 driver. Thus, HPFS386 is faster than HPFS and highly optimized for server applications. It is also highly tunable by experienced administrators.

Though IBM still had rights to HPFS, its agreement with Microsoft to continue licensing the HPFS386 version was contingent upon the company paying Microsoft a licensing fee for each copy sold. This was a result of the Microsoft and IBM collaboration that gave both the right to use Windows and OS/2 technology.

Due to the Microsoft dependence, limited partition size, file size limit of 2 GB and the long disk-check times after a crash, IBM ported the journaling file system, JFS, to OS/2 as a substitute.

DOS and Linux support HPFS via third-party drivers. Windows NT versions 3.51 and earlier had native support for HPFS.

== Native support under Windows ==
Windows 95 and its successors Windows 98 and Windows Me have no support for HPFS. , because NTFS and HPFS share the same filesystem identification number in the partition table.

Windows NT 3.1 and 3.5 have native read/write support for local disks and can even be installed onto an HPFS partition. 

Windows NT 3.51 can also read and write from local HPFS formatted drives. Starting with Windows NT 4 the filesystem driver &quot;PINBALL.SYS&quot; enabling the read/write access is not shipped anymore. Later Windows versions do not ship with this driver. Note that this driver is limited to 4GB HPFS volumes.

Microsoft retained rights to OS/2 technologies, including the HPFS filesystem, after they ceased collaboration with IBM. Since Windows NT 3.1 was designed for more rigorous (enterprise-class) use than previous versions of Windows, it included support for HPFS (and NTFS) giving it a larger storage capacity than the FAT12 and FAT16 filesystems. However, since HPFS lacks a journal, any recovery after an unexpected shutdown or other error state takes progressively longer as the filesystem grows. A utility such as CHKDSK would need to scan each entry in the filesystem to ensure no errors are present, a problem which is vastly reduced on NTFS, which simply replays the journal.

<text>The U.S. State of Colorado is divided into 64 counties. Two of these, the City and County of Denver, which serves as the state capital, and the City and County of Broomfield, have consolidated city and county governments. Of the other 62 counties, all operate under Dillon&#x27;s Rule except the two that are home rule (Pitkin and Weld). Counties are important units of government in Colorado since there are no civil townships or other minor civil divisions.

El Paso County, with a population of 730,395 in 2020, is the most populous county in Colorado, while San Juan County is the least populous, with a population of 705. Las Animas County, in area, is the most extensive county, while the City and County of Broomfield, in area, is the least extensive. The City and County of Denver is the most densely populated Colorado county, with a population density of 4,674 residents per square mile (1,805/km2) as of 2020, while Hinsdale County is the least densely populated county, with a population density of 0.71 resident per square mile (0.27/km2).

Mount Elbert, the highest summit of Colorado and the entire Rocky Mountains at an elevation of , is located in Lake County. The lowest point in Colorado is where the Arikaree River flows out of Yuma County and into Kansas, at elevation. This point, which is the highest low point of any state, is higher than the highest points of 18 states and the District of Columbia.
== History ==
On November 1, 1861, the new Territory of Colorado created 17 original counties: Arapahoe, Boulder, Clear Creek, Costilla, Douglas, El Paso, Fremont, Gilpin, Guadalupe, Huerfano, Jefferson, Lake, Larimer, Park, Pueblo, Summit, and Weld; plus the Cheyenne Reserve. Six days later, the name of Guadelupe County was changed to Conejos County.

On February 9, 1866, the first new county, Las Animas, was created, followed by Saguache in December of that year. Bent County was created in February 1870, followed by Greenwood the following month. On February 2, 1874, Grand County and Elbert County were formed, and on February 10, La Plata, Hinsdale, and Rio Grande counties were created. Greenwood was absorbed into Bent on February 5. The last county to be created under the Colorado Territory name was San Juan County, created three months before statehood.

By the time Colorado became a state on August 1, 1876, it had only 26 counties. In January 1877, Routt and Ouray were formed, followed by Gunnison and Custer counties in March. In February 1879, Chaffee County was created. From February 8–10, 1879, Lake county was renamed Carbonate County. In 1881, Dolores County and Pitkin County were created. In 1883, Montrose, Mesa, Garfield, Eagle, Delta, and San Miguel counties were formed, leaving the total number of counties at 39. The number rose to 40 in 1885 with the creation of Archuleta County on April 14. Washington County and Logan County were both created in 1887. Between February 19 and April 16 in 1889, Morgan, Yuma, Cheyenne, Otero, Rio Blanco, Phillips, Sedgwick, Kiowa, Kit Carson, Lincoln, Prowers, Baca, and Montezuma counties were formed, bringing the total to 55. By 1900, Mineral County and Teller County had been added. On November 15, 1902, Arapahoe County was split into Adams and South Arapahoe Counties, and Denver was reconstituted as a consolidated city-county from portions of both newly formed counties on December 1, 1902. By 1912, Jackson County, Moffat County, and Crowley County had been created. Alamosa was created in 1913. In 2001, Broomfield was reconstituted as a consolidated city-county from parts of Adams, Boulder, Jefferson and Weld counties, bringing the total to 64 counties.

== 2023 population estimates ==
For United States Census Bureau population estimates for Colorado counties as of July 1, 2023, see the List of Colorado counties by population. That list ranks the counties by 2023 population and includes population changes since the 2000 United States Census. That list also includes the county websites, links to Colorado Department of Transportation county maps, and the geographic coordinates of the counties.

As of July 1, 2023, El Paso County remains the most populous county in Colorado with a population estimate of 744,215, while Hinsdale County with a 2023 population of 765 is now the least populous. Five of the 64 Colorado counties now have more than 500,000 residents, while 12 counties have fewer than 5,000 residents.

:8. Las Animas County was the first new Colorado county to be created (in 1866) after the original 17 counties.
:9. Greenwood County was the longest lived former Colorado county, existing four years from 1870 to 1874.
:10. In 1876, San Juan County became the last county created by the Territory of Colorado, bringing the total number of territorial counties to 26.
:11. In 1877, Ouray County became the first county created by the new State of Colorado.
:12. Carbonate County was the shortest lived former Colorado county, existing only two days in 1879 before being dissolved.
:13. The City and County of Broomfield became the newest Colorado county in 2001, bring the total number of counties to 64.

== County distinctions ==
:1. El Paso County (88) and the City and County of Denver (93) and are among the 100 most populous counties of the United States.
:2. San Juan County (16), Hinsdale County (25), Mineral County (32), Jackson County (55), Kiowa County (59), and Cheyenne County (80) are among the 100 least populous counties of the United States.
:3. Jefferson County borders ten adjacent counties, the most of any Colorado county.
:4. Delta County and the City and County of Denver each border only three adjacent counties, the fewest of Colorado counties.
:5. Weld County has the most incorporated municipalities of any Colorado county with 31.
:6. The following nine Colorado counties have no incorporated municipalities other than their county seat:

:7. Of all 64 Colorado counties, only Conejos County has a county seat that is not an incorporated municipality.
:8. The City and County of Denver and the City and County of Broomfield are the only two Colorado counties with enclaves. Arapahoe County, Boulder County, and Jefferson County are the only three Colorado counties with exclaves.

<text>The Windows API, informally WinAPI, is the foundational application programming interface (API) that allows a computer program to access the features of the Microsoft Windows operating system in which the program is running. Programs can access API functionality via shared-library technologies or via system-file access.

Each major version of the Windows API has a distinct name that identifies a compatibility aspect of that version. For example, Win32 is the major version of Windows API that runs on 32-bit systems. The name, Windows API, collectively refers to all versions of this capability of Windows.

Microsoft provides developer support via a software development kit, Microsoft Windows SDK, which includes documentation and tools for building software based on the Windows API.

==Services==

This section lists notable services provided by the Windows API.

===Base Services===
Base services include features such as the file system, devices, processes, threads, and error handling. These functions reside in &lt;samp&gt;kernel.exe&lt;/samp&gt;, &lt;samp&gt;krnl286.exe&lt;/samp&gt; or &lt;samp&gt;krnl386.exe&lt;/samp&gt; files on 16-bit Windows, and &lt;samp&gt;kernel32.dll and KernelBase.dll&lt;/samp&gt; on 32 and 64 bit Windows. These files reside in the folder &lt;samp&gt;\Windows\System32&lt;/samp&gt; on all versions of Windows.

===Advanced Services===
Advanced services include features beyond the kernel like the Windows registry, shutdown/restart the system (or abort), start/stop/create a Windows service, manage user accounts. These functions reside in &lt;samp&gt;advapi32.dll&lt;/samp&gt; and &lt;samp&gt;advapires32.dll&lt;/samp&gt; on 32-bit Windows.

===Graphics Device Interface===
The Graphics Device Interface (GDI) component provides features to output graphics content to monitors, printers, and other output devices. It resides in &lt;samp&gt;gdi.exe&lt;/samp&gt; on 16-bit Windows, and &lt;samp&gt;gdi32.dll&lt;/samp&gt; on 32-bit Windows in user-mode. Kernel-mode GDI support is provided by codice_1 which communicates directly with the graphics driver.

===User Interface===
The User Interface component provides features to create and manage screen windows and most basic controls, such as buttons and scrollbars, receive mouse and keyboard input, and other functions associated with the graphical user interface (GUI) part of Windows. This functional unit resides in &lt;samp&gt;user.exe&lt;/samp&gt; on 16-bit Windows, and &lt;samp&gt;user32.dll&lt;/samp&gt; on 32-bit Windows. Since Windows XP versions, the basic controls reside in &lt;samp&gt;comctl32.dll&lt;/samp&gt;, together with the common controls (Common Control Library).

===Common Dialog Box Library===
The Common Dialog Box Library provides standard dialog boxes to open and save files, choose color and font, etc. The library resides in a file called &lt;samp&gt;commdlg.dll&lt;/samp&gt; on 16-bit Windows, and &lt;samp&gt;comdlg32.dll&lt;/samp&gt; on 32-bit Windows. It is grouped under the &quot;User Interface&quot; category of the API.

===Common Control Library===
The Common Control Library provides access to advanced user interface controls include things like status bars, progress bars, toolbars and tabs. The library resides in a DLL file called &lt;samp&gt;commctrl.dll&lt;/samp&gt; on 16-bit Windows, and &lt;samp&gt;comctl32.dll&lt;/samp&gt; on 32-bit Windows. It is grouped under the &quot;User Interface&quot; category of the API.

===Windows Shell===
The Windows Shell component provides access to the operating system shell. The component resides in &lt;samp&gt;shell.dll&lt;/samp&gt; on 16-bit Windows, and &lt;samp&gt;shell32.dll&lt;/samp&gt; on 32-bit Windows. The Shell Lightweight Utility Functions are in &lt;samp&gt;shlwapi.dll&lt;/samp&gt;. It is grouped under the &quot;User Interface&quot; category of the API. 

===Network Services===
Network Services provide access to the various networking abilities of the operating system. Its subcomponents include NetBIOS, Winsock, NetDDE, remote procedure call (RPC) and many more. This component resides in &lt;samp&gt;netapi32.dll&lt;/samp&gt; on 32-bit Windows.

===Web===
The Internet Explorer (IE) web browser exposes APIs and as such could be considered part of the Windows API. IE has been included with the operating system since Windows 95 OSR2 and has provided web-related services to applications since Windows 98.

==Program interaction==

The Windows API is a C language-based API. Functions and data structures are consumable via C syntax by including windows.h, but the API can be consumed via any programming language that can inter-operate with the API data structures and calling conventions for function calls and callbacks. 

Of note, the implementation of API functions has been developed in several languages other than C. 

Despite the fact that C is not an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, the Windows API is somewhat object-oriented due to its use of handles. Various other technologies from Microsoft and others make this object-oriented aspect more apparent by using an OOP language such as C++ — see Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC), Visual Component Library (VCL), GDI+. Of note, Windows 8 provides the Windows API and the WinRT API, which is implemented in C++ and is object-oriented by design.

Windows.pas is a Delphi unit that exposes the features of Windows API the Pascal equivalent of windows.h.

==Related technologies==

Many Microsoft technologies use the Windows API -- as most software running on Windows does. As middle-ware between Windows API and an application, the following technologies provide some access to Windows API. Some technologies are described as wrapping Windows API, but this is debatable since they don&#x27;t provide or expose all of the capabilities of Windows API. 

* Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC) exposes some of Windows API functionality in C++ classes, and thus allows a more object-oriented way to interact with the API
* Active Template Library (ATL) is a C++ template library that provides some Windows API access
* Windows Template Library (WTL) was developed as an extension to ATL, and intended as a smaller alternative to MFC
* Most application frameworks for Windows provide some access to Windows API; including .NET runtime and Java virtual machine and any other programming languages targeting Windows
* Various technologies for communicating between components and applications starting with Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE), which was superseded by Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) and later by the Component Object Model (COM), Automation Objects, ActiveX controls, and the .NET Framework

Although almost all Windows programs use the Windows API, on the Windows NT line of operating systems, programs that start early in the Windows startup process use the Native API instead.

==History==

The Windows API has always exposed a large part of the underlying structure of the Windows systems to programmers. This had the advantage of giving them much flexibility and power over their applications, but also creates great responsibility in how applications handle various low-level, sometimes tedious, operations that are associated with a graphical user interface.

For example, a beginning C programmer will often write the simple &quot;hello world&quot; as their first assignment. The working part of the program is only a single printf line within the main subroutine. The overhead for linking to the standard I/O library is also only one line:

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void) {
 printf(&quot;Hello, World!\n&quot;);

Charles Petzold, who wrote several books about programming for the Windows API, said: &quot;The original hello world program in the Windows 1.0 SDK was a bit of a scandal. HELLO.C was about 150 lines long, and the HELLO.RC resource script had another 20 or so more lines. (...) Veteran programmers often curled up in horror or laughter when encountering the Windows hello-world program.&quot; Petzold explains that while it was the first Windows sample programs developers were introduced to, it was quite &quot;fancy&quot; and more complex than needed. Tired of people ridiculing the length of the sample, he eventually reduced it to a simple MessageBox call.

Over the years, various changes and additions were made to Windows systems, and the Windows API changed and grew to reflect this. The Windows API for Windows 1.0 supported fewer than 450 function calls, whereas modern versions of the Windows API support thousands. However, in general, the interface remained fairly consistent, and an old Windows 1.0 application will still look familiar to a programmer who is used to the modern Windows API.

Microsoft has made an effort to maintain backward compatibility. To achieve this, when developing new versions of Windows, Microsoft sometimes implemented workarounds to allow compatibility with third-party software that used the prior version in an undocumented or even inadvisable way. Raymond Chen, a Microsoft developer who works on the Windows API, has said: &quot;I could probably write for months solely about bad things apps do and what we had to do to get them to work again (often in spite of themselves). Which is why I get particularly furious when people accuse Microsoft of maliciously breaking applications during OS upgrades. If any application failed to run on Windows 95, I took it as a personal failure.&quot;

One of the largest changes to the Windows API was the transition from Win16 (shipped in Windows 3.1 and older) to Win32 (Windows NT and Windows 95 and up). While Win32 was originally introduced with Windows NT 3.1 and Win32s allowed use of a Win32 subset before Windows 95, it was not until Windows 95 that widespread porting of applications to Win32 began. To ease the transition, in Windows 95, for developers outside and inside Microsoft, a complex scheme of API thunks was used that could allow 32-bit code to call into 16-bit code (for most of Win16 APIs) and vice versa. &quot;Flat thunks&quot; allowed 32-bit code to call into 16-bit libraries, and the scheme was used extensively inside Windows 95&#x27;s libraries to avoid porting the whole OS to Win32 in one batch. In Windows NT, the OS was pure 32-bit, except parts for compatibility with 16-bit applications, and only generic thunks were available to thunk from Win16 to Win32, as for Windows 95. The Platform SDK shipped with a compiler that could produce the code needed for these thunks. Versions of 64-bit Windows are also able to run 32-bit applications via WoW64. The SysWOW64 folder located in the Windows folder on the OS drive contains several tools to support 32-bit applications.

==Major versions==
Each version of Microsoft Windows contains a version of Windows API, and almost every new version of Microsoft Windows has introduced additions and changes to the Windows API. 

The name, Windows API, refers to essentially the same capability in each version of Windows, but there is another name for this capability that is based on major architectural aspects of the Windows version that contains it. When there was only one version, it was simply called Windows API. Then, when the first major update was made, Microsoft gave it the name Win32 and gave the first version the name Win16. The term Windows API refers to both versions and all subsequently developed major versions.

* Win16 is in the 16-bit versions of Windows. The functions reside mainly in core files of the OS: &quot;kernel.exe&quot; (or &quot;krnl286.exe&quot; or &quot;krnl386.exe&quot;), &quot;user.exe&quot; and &quot;gdi.exe&quot;. Despite the file extension of &lt;samp&gt;exe&lt;/samp&gt;, such a file is accessed as a DLL.
* Win32 is in the 32-bit versions of Windows (NT, 95, and later). The functions are implemented in system DLL files including kernel32.dll, user32.dll, and gdi32.dll. Win32 was introduced with Windows NT. In Windows 95, it was initially referred to as Win32c, with &quot;c&quot; meaning &quot;compatibility&quot;. This term was later abandoned by Microsoft in favor of Win32.
* Win32s is an extension for the Windows 3.1x family of Microsoft Windows that implemented a subset of the Win32 API for these systems. The &quot;s&quot; stands for &quot;subset&quot;.
* Win64 is the version in the 64-bit platforms of the Windows architecture (, x86-64 and AArch64). Both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of an application can be compiled from one codebase, although some older API functions have been deprecated, and some of the API functions that were deprecated in Win32 were removed. All memory pointers are 64-bit by default (the LLP64 model), so porting Win32-compatible source code includes updating for 64-bit pointer arithmetic.
* WinCE is the version in the Windows CE operating system.

==Other implementations==

The Wine project provides a Win32 API compatibility layer for Unix-like platforms, between Linux kernel API and programs written for the Windows API. ReactOS goes a step further and aims to implement the full Windows operating system, working closely with the Wine project to promote code re-use and compatibility. DosWin32 and HX DOS Extender are other projects which emulate the Windows API to allow executing simple Windows programs from a DOS command line. Odin is a project to emulate Win32 on OS/2, superseding the original Win-OS/2 emulation which was based on Microsoft code. Other minor implementations include the MEWEL and Zinc libraries which were intended to implement a subset of the Win16 API on DOS (see List of platform-independent GUI libraries).

Windows Interface Source Environment (WISE) was a licensing program from Microsoft which allowed developers to recompile and run Windows-based applications on Unix and Macintosh platforms. WISE SDKs were based on an emulator of the Windows API that could run on those platforms.

Efforts toward standardization included Sun&#x27;s Public Windows Interface (PWI) for Win16 (see also: Sun Windows Application Binary Interface (Wabi)), Willows Software&#x27;s Application Programming Interface for Windows (APIW) for Win16 and Win32 (see also: Willows TWIN), and ECMA-234, which attempted to standardize the Windows API bindingly.

==Compiler support==

To develop software that uses the Windows API, a compiler must be able to use the Microsoft-specific DLLs listed above (COM-objects are outside Win32 and assume a certain vtable layout). The compiler must either handle the header files that expose the interior API function names, or supply such files.

For the language C++, Zortech (later Symantec, then Digital Mars), Watcom and Borland have all produced well known commercial compilers that have been used often with Win16, Win32s, and Win32. Some of them supplied &quot;memory extenders&quot;, allowing Win32 programs to run on Win16 with Microsoft&#x27;s redistributable Win32s DLL. The Zortech compiler was probably one of the first stable and usable C++ compilers for Windows programming, before Microsoft had a C++ compiler.

For certain classes of applications, the compiler system should also be able to handle interface description language (IDL) files. Collectively, these prerequisites (compilers, tools, libraries, and headers) are known as the &quot;Microsoft Platform SDK&quot;. For a time, the Microsoft Visual Studio and Borland&#x27;s integrated development system were the only integrated development environments (IDEs) that could provide this (although, the SDK is downloadable for free separately from the entire IDE suite, from Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows 7 and .NET Framework 4).

, the MinGW and Cygwin projects also provide such an environment based on the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), using a stand-alone header file set, to make linking against the Win32-specific DLLs simple. LCC-Win32 is a C compiler maintained by Jacob Navia, freeware for non-commercial use. Pelles C is a freeware C compiler maintained by Pelle Orinius. Free Pascal is a free software Object Pascal compiler that supports the Windows API. The MASM32 package is a mature project providing support for the Windows API under Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) by using custom made or converted headers and libraries from the Platform SDK. Flat assembler FASM allows building Windows programs without using an external linker, even when running on Linux.

Windows specific compiler support is also needed for Structured Exception Handling (SEH). This system serves two purposes: it provides a substrate on which language-specific exception handling can be implemented, and it is how the kernel notifies applications of exceptional conditions such as dereferencing an invalid pointer or stack overflow. The Microsoft/Borland C++ compilers had the ability to use this system as soon as it was introduced in Windows 95 and NT, however the actual implementation was undocumented and had to be reverse engineered for the Wine project and free compilers. SEH is based on pushing exception handler frames onto the stack, then adding them to a linked list stored in thread-local storage (the first field of the thread environment block). When an exception is thrown, the kernel and base libraries unwind the stack running handlers and filters as they are encountered. Eventually, every exception unhandled by the application will be dealt with by the default backstop handler, which pops up the Windows common crash dialog.

<text>Glendale is a city located primarily in the Verdugo Mountains region, with a small portion in the San Fernando Valley, of Los Angeles County, California, United States. As of 2023, Glendale had a Census-estimated population of 187,050, down 8,493 (–4.8%) from the 2020 United States census count of 196,543, which in turn was up from 191,719 at the 2010 census, making it the 4th-most populous city in Los Angeles County and the 24th-most populous city in California. It is located about north of downtown Los Angeles.

Glendale lies in the Verdugo Mountains, and is a suburb in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The city is bordered to the northwest by the Shadow Hills and Tujunga neighborhoods of Los Angeles; to the northeast by La Cañada Flintridge and the unincorporated area of La Crescenta; to the west by Burbank and Griffith Park; to the east by Eagle Rock and Pasadena; to the south by the Atwater Village neighborhood of Los Angeles; and to the southeast by Glassell Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. The Golden State, Ventura, Glendale, and Foothill freeways run through the city.

==History==
===Indigenous history===
The earliest known inhabitants of Glendale and its surroundings were members of the Tongva people. Villages in the Glendale-La Crescenta-Montrose area included Ashwaangna, Hahamongna, Maungna, Tujunga and Wiqanga.

===Spanish era===
In 1797, José María Verdugo, a corporal in the Spanish army from Baja California, received the Rancho San Rafael from Governor Diego de Borica, formalizing his possession and use of land on which he had been grazing livestock and farming since 1784. Rancho San Rafael was a Spanish concession, of which 25 were made in California. Unlike the later Mexican land grants, the concessions were similar to grazing permits, with the title remaining with the Spanish crown.

Jose Maria Verdugo retired from the military and began expanding his ranch operations. Soon he had nearly 2,000 head of cattle, 670 horses and 70 mules. With the help of his son, Julio, he built several adobe structures for various uses. Workers grew crops such grains, peppers, oranges, figs, grapes and pomegranates, and also made wine.

===Mexican era===

New Spain achieved its independence from the Spanish Empire in 1821, and from 1824, Rancho San Rafael existed within the new Mexican Republic.

When Jose Maria Verdugo died in 1831, his estate was divided between his son, Julio, and his daughter, Catalina.

===American era===
Mexican rule ended during the Mexican–American War: Americans took control from the Californios after a series of battles, culminating with the signing of the Treaty of Cahuenga on January 13, 1847. With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican–American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1852, confirmed by the Commission in 1855, and the grant was patented to Julio and Catalina Verdugo in 1882.

In 1861, Julio Verdugo took out a mortgage to build a larger house. Unable to make the loan payments, the family was forced into bankruptcy proceedings. In 1871, the court divided the ranch into several parcels to satisfy the many claims against the Verdugos.

The court gave Benjamin Dreyfus, of California, the largest allotment: more than 8,000 acres, which later became Eagle Rock and Tropico. Andrew Glassell and Alfred Chapman were awarded the great Rancho La Cañada and more than 2,000 acres of what is now Highland Park and York Valley. David Burbank was awarded 4,607 acres, and his property eventually became the neighboring city of Burbank.

==== Incorporation and growth ====
The arrival of the railroad in Southern California set off a real estate boom. In 1883, soon after Atwater Village was settled, the Atwater Tract Office brought train service to the area. On March 11, 1887, Erskine Mayo Ross, Cameron E. Thom, and several others, filed the first plat for Glendale, described as &quot;Pasadena&#x27;s first and only rival.&quot; It was bounded by First Street (now Lexington Drive) on the north, Fifth Street (now Harvard Street) on the south, Central Avenue on the west, and the Childs Tract on the east. Concurrently, to the southwest formed Tropico.

An important civic booster of the era was Leslie Coombs Brand (1859–1925), who partnered with Henry E. Huntington to bring the Pacific Electric Railway, or the &quot;Red Cars&quot;, to the area. The Glendale–Burbank Line, which was operational from 1904 to 1955, ran from Downtown Los Angeles to Burbank via Glendale. At the railroad dedication celebration, Brand spoke of &quot;his early dreams coming true, in which he pictured a country home in close proximity to the city.&quot; Brand also owned Glendale Light &amp; Power Company, the Miradero Water Company, and the Consolidated Water Company. By 1915, Leslie Brand had divested most of his financial interests in Glendale.

The Forest Lawn Cemetery opened in 1906.

The city officially incorporated in 1906, but lacked a permanent city hall. The architecture firm of Anderson and Murdock won a contract to construct a new city hall in 1910, and it was completed in 1912.

Pioneering endocrinologist and entrepreneur Henry R. Harrower opened his clinic in Glendale in 1920, which for many years was the largest business in the city.

Following the 1922 demolition of the Atwater Tract Office, Southern Pacific Railroad constructed the Glendale Southern Pacific Railroad Depot. Glendale was served by the Southern Pacific Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Coast Daylight&quot; daytime and &quot;Lark&quot; overnight passenger trains.

The Hotel Glendale, a six-story beaux-arts building which boasted 160 rooms and two elevators, became Glendale&#x27;s tallest building when it opened in 1925. Its location, at the intersection of Broadway and Glendale Avenue, was chosen because of its proximity to several transportation lines.

The Alexander Theatre opened in 1925, and featured vaudeville performances and silent films on a single screen.

The Grand Central Airport opened in 1929. Within a year, the enterprise was sold to the Curtiss-Wright Flying Service, managed by C. C. Moseley, a co-founder of the future Western Airlines. It became the city&#x27;s largest employer. It was also at Grand Central that Moseley established the first of his private flying schools, Curtiss-Wright Technical Institute (later renamed Cal-Aero Academy).

The Renaissance Revival-style Glendale Main Post Office opened in 1934. 
Several Works Progress Administration projects were constructed in Glendale during the 1930s, including Glendale Community College&#x27;s John A. Davitt Administration Building (1937) and the Glendale Civic Auditorium (1938).

==== Contemporary history ====
The Second World War proved to be a boon to Glendale as Southern California became a major staging area for the Pacific War. Grand Central Airport served as a training facility for pilots and mechanics, while a foundry on San Fernando Road produced airplane parts.

In 1941, the city launched a municipal bus system named Glendale City Lines.

In 1942, a new Glendale City Hall, a Works Progress Administration project in the PWA Moderne style, was completed on the site of Glendale&#x27;s first permanent City Hall from 1912. In 1943, the Los Angeles County Superior Court opened a courthouse in Glendale. 

In October 1953, the Glendale–Burbank Line came under the purview of Metropolitan Coach Lines, which initiated a series of service reductions. Interurban service ended in 1955, bringing an end to Glendale&#x27;s streetcar suburb era.

With the proliferation of jet aircraft, Grand Central Airport&#x27;s relatively short 3,400-foot runway was unable to accommodate modern aircraft. In 1959, the airport shut down. In 1961, Walt Disney purchased a large portion of the closed airport to establish a creative workshop for employees working on the construction of Disney theme parks and attractions worldwide. Initially named WED Enterprises, the team came to be known as Walt Disney Imagineering.

Until as late as the 1960s, Glendale was a sundown town, which meant that non-white people were required to leave city limits by a certain time each day or risk arrest and possible violence. In 1964, Glendale was selected by George Lincoln Rockwell to be the West Coast headquarters of the American Nazi Party. After a legal battle with the city of Glendale, the party moved their headquarters to El Monte in 1966. 

=====Demographic and economic changes=====
The emergence of increasingly visible ethnic groups — including Armenians, Cubans, Filipinos and Koreans — changed the official discourse in Glendale. In 1972, C.E. Perkins, then city manager, encouraged the Rotary Club of Glendale to prepare itself as the city could no longer remain isolated in an increasingly diverse America. Through the 1970s, concurrent with increasing immigration into Glendale, was the city&#x27;s rapid urbanization. During this era, the Glendale Freeway and the Ventura Freeway were constructed. The Glendale Galleria shopping mall opened in 1976, and was further expanded in 1982.

In the 1980s, many single-family homes in south Glendale were demolished for apartment and condominium construction. This construction boom resulted in Glendale&#x27;s population growing at a rate 60% higher than that of the county at large, turning the city into a denser, younger and more cosmopolitan urban center. In 1983, Larry Zarian was elected as the city&#x27;s first Armenian city council member, and in 1986, he became the city&#x27;s first Armenian mayor. In 1984, the city revived municipal service with the Glendale Beeline.

By 1990, Glendale was, proportionately, more immigrant than either the city or county of Los Angeles, with 45% of its residents being foreign-born. By the mid-1990s, Glendale&#x27;s Anglo-American population had been surpassed by Armenians and Latinos. Some Anglo-American residents, largely fueled by anti-Armenian sentiment, decried the increased density in South Glendale.

By the 2000s, Glendale had outgrown its &quot;bedroom community&quot; reputation as an urban area of its own, in large part due to the Americana at Brand outdoor shopping and residential community. The new development was opened to the public in 2008, featuring 75 shops, restaurants, apartments, condominiums, and an 18-plex cinema. In 2023, Americana at Brand owner Caruso claimed that the lifestyle center had &quot;replac[ed] blighted properties and ignit[ed] a wave of higher-end housing, retail, office space and hotel development in Glendale.&quot; In response to the Americana at Brand&#x27;s opening, the Glendale Galleria underwent an extensive renovation in 2012. By 2014, the construction of thousands of luxury apartments in downtown Glendale raised fears of gentrification. The post-Americana development boom has also included several hotels, such as a Hampton Inn &amp; Suites (2016), a Hyatt Place (2017), The Glenmark (2020) and a Hotel Indigo (2025).

==Geography==
Glendale is located in the southeastern San Fernando Valley. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of ; of it is land and of it (0.43%) is covered by water. Glendale is the fourth largest city within Los Angeles County. It is bordered to the north by the foothill communities of La Cañada Flintridge, La Crescenta, and Tujunga; to the south by the Atwater Village and Glassell Park communities incorporated by the city of Los Angeles; to the east by Pasadena and Eagle Rock (also incorporated within Los Angeles); and to the west by Griffith Park and the city of Burbank. Glendale is located north of downtown Los Angeles.

===Geology===
Several known earthquake faults criss-cross the Glendale area and adjacent mountains, as in much of Southern California. Among the more recognized faults are the Sierra Madre and Hollywood faults, situated in the city&#x27;s northern and southwestern portions, respectively. Additionally, the Verdugo and Raymond faults intersect through the city&#x27;s central and southeastern areas. The San Gabriel fault, meanwhile, is located northeast of the city. Roughly northeast of Glendale is a major portion of the San Andreas Fault known as the &quot;Big Bend&quot;, where quake-recurrence tracking shows major activity roughly every 140–160 years. The closest portion of the San Andreas is actually from Glendale. The last major quake along the southern San Andreas was recorded in 1857.

In the 1971 San Fernando earthquake, which took place along the western edge of the Sierra Madre Fault, surface ruptures were nearly long, including one portion a few miles northwest of Glendale. Most of the damage was in the northern San Fernando Valley, though 31 structures in Glendale suffered major damage and had to be demolished, plus numerous chimneys collapsed. The 1994 Northridge earthquake had an epicenter about from Glendale. The city suffered severe damage to a public parking structure and sections of the Glendale Galleria parking structures and exterior columns incurred damages.

===Climate===
Glendale has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csa&quot;), with hot summers and mild winters with occasional rainfall. The highest recorded temperature in Glendale was on September 6, 2020. The lowest recorded temperature was on February 15, 1990. The warmest month is August and the coolest month is January.

The annual average precipitation is just over , mostly falling between November and April. Rainfall totals are highly variable from year to year, with the wettest years (sometimes over of rainfall) usually associated with warm El Niño conditions, and the drier years (sometimes under of rainfall) with cool La Niña episodes in the Pacific.

The hills and mountains of northern Glendale very rarely have snow, owing to its warmer temperatures during the winter. It may only occur about every five to ten years. The last time it snowed was February 26, 2011, in which snow accumulation of approximately occurred and sleet was present. Frost sometimes occurs at night from late November to early March. Heavy rains and thunderstorms are also common during the winter. The spring brings temperate weather, with little rain. The summer is usually fairly warm, with highs from , to the low 100s (40 °C). Summer is usually very dry, but thunderstorms can come from Arizona, bringing high humidity into the area. These rare days cause heat indices over . Fall often brings clear and dry weather, but can be gusty due to the Santa Ana winds, blowing in once or twice a year from October to December. Santa Ana winds can reach up to , with gusts up to in mountain passes and canyons. Thunderstorms occur very rarely and they are accompanied by gusty winds and hail.

===Race and ethnicity===
====Armenians====
Glendale has one of the largest communities of Armenian descent in the United States.

=====History=====
Armenian families have lived in the city since the 1920s, but the surge in immigration escalated in the 1970s. Armenian Americans are well integrated into the city, with many businesses, several Armenian schools, and ethnic/cultural organizations serving this ethnic group. Beginning in the late 1970s, as a result of the Lebanese Civil War and the Iranian Revolution, a dramatic influx of Armenians began to arrive in Glendale.

Beginning in the late 1980s, with assistance from family and friends already there, Armenians from the former Soviet Union began arriving. In the Glendale Unified School District, by 1988, along with students from the Middle East, they had become the largest ethnic group in the public schools, now having a larger number than Latinos.

By 1999, about 25% of the population spoke Armenian and there were many Armenian businesses.

According to the United States 2000 Census, Glendale is home to 65,343 Armenian Americans (making up 34.1% of the total population), increasing from 1990 when there were 31,402 Armenian Americans in the city. As of 2005, one-third of Los Angeles&#x27; estimated 153,000 Armenians (or 51,000, around a quarter of Glendale&#x27;s 205,000 residents) lived in Glendale. At that time, Armenians held a majority on the Glendale city council, and it had done so since that year. By 2005, the Armenian population was 40% of the total population.

In 2014, a Glendale Police Department spokesperson, stated, &quot;In five to eight years, the [Armenian] community went from a few thousand to about 40,000.&quot; Levon Marashlian, an instructor of Armenian history at Glendale College, stated that in the early 1990s Glendale&#x27;s Armenian community became the largest in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, surpassing the Armenian community of Hollywood. Alice Petrossian, the GUSD director of intercultural education, stated that Burbank lies within the middle of other Armenian communities, so it attracted Armenians. There are also a great number of Armenian immigrants from Iran who, due to the religious restrictions and lifestyle limitations of the Islamic government, immigrated to the US, many to Glendale since it was where their relatives resided.

=====Organizations=====
In 1994, a new headquarters of the Armenian National Committee of America-Western Region opened in Glendale. ANCA Chairman Raffi Hamparian stated &quot;One could look at it cynically and say they&#x27;re coming because this is an election year, but on the other hand[,] the Armenian community has a lot of friends, because we&#x27;re active in the public life of many cities[.]&quot; In 2004, the Armenian Cultural Foundation started planning for an educational and recreational youth center in south Glendale. In 2009, upon the center&#x27;s completion, the various Armenian Revolutionary Federation-aligned organizations — such as the Armenian National Committee of America, the Armenian Relief Society, the Armenian Youth Federation and Hamazkayin — moved to this new facility.

The Armenian Assembly of America&#x27;s Western Region office is in Glendale.

The Armenian General Benevolent Union serves Glendale through its Pasadena-based Pasadena-Glendale chapter.

Homenetmen, a non-aligned sport and scouting organization, started its Glendale Ararat chapter in 1983. Since 1996, the chapter has been located in neighboring Glassell Park.

====Other ethnic groups====
In the 1930s, Glendale prevented the Civilian Conservation Corps from stationing African American workers in a local park, citing sundown town ordinances that both cities had adopted.

The Mexican American community was established in Glendale by the 1960s. The late 1980s and early 1990s also saw increases in Mexican American population as Glendale offers higher-quality education in a safer suburban environment away from the city.

Several Korean cities have sought to create business and cultural relationships with Glendale. Central Park has the only West Coast monument to Korean comfort women of World War II.

, Filipino Americans were the third largest minority group in Glendale, making up seven percent of the city&#x27;s total population, overtaking Korean Americans.
In 2022, the Filipino American Friendship Monument was unveiled in Central Park.

After the Iranian Revolution, many Persians migrated to the cities seeking a suburban city with lower crime and quality education.

===Religion===
====Christianity====
St. Mark&#x27;s Episcopal Church dates back to 1888, but the current building was built in 1948.

Holy Family Catholic Church dates back to 1907, but the current building was consecrated in 1922.

Since 2019, glendaleOUT has advocated on behalf of Glendale&#x27;s LGBT+ residents. Since 2022, the origination has hosted the annual Glendale Pride in the Park event held at Adams Square Mini-Park. The event is a family-friendly picnic.

GALAS LGBTQ+ Armenian Society provides specialized services to the local Armenian LGBT+ community, and the organization has been recognized as a community leader by Glendale elected officials. At the Glendale City Council&#x27;s 2024 proclamation declaring June as LGBTQ+ Pride Month, GALAS Boardmember Shant Jaltorossian commented, stating &quot;Our work as a cultural hub and resource group emphasizes the importance of intersectionality in our fight for justice. GALAS will continue to build a loving community which celebrates our roots, both Armenian and LGBTQ+, as we advocate for a better, more inclusive future.&quot;

====Anti-LGBT+ hate in Glendale====
At the June 6, 2023 Glendale Unified Board of Education meeting, where an annual Pride Month declaration was to occur, a crowd of more than 200 — including far-right organizations such as the Proud Boys — gathered outside the Glendale Unified School District headquarters. As tensions between pro- and anti-LGBT+ sides rose, the Glendale Police Department declared an unlawful assembly.

Grand Central Airport was a municipal airport developed from 1923 which became the largest employer in Glendale for many years, and contributed to the development of aviation in the United States in many important ways. The main terminal building still stands and includes both Art Deco and Spanish-style architectural elements. The facility was the first official terminal for the Los Angeles area, as well as the departure point for the first commercial west-to-east transcontinental flight flown by Charles Lindbergh. During World War II, the Grand Central Air Terminal building was camouflaged to protect it from enemy targeting. It was closed down in 1959, and made way for the Grand Central Business Centre, an industrial park.

===Film and television industry===

Glendale, along with neighboring Burbank, has served as a major production center for the American film industry and especially animation.

Located near Walt Disney&#x27;s Hyperion studio in Los Feliz, the Alex Theatre was Disney&#x27;s favorite place during the 1930s to gauge audience reactions to his cartoons. Following his death in 1966, Disney was interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park.

When The Walt Disney Company outgrew its Burbank studio lot in the early 1960s, it expanded to Glendale&#x27;s Grand Central Business Centre. First came the headquarters for Imagineering, and from 1985 to 1995, during the Disney Renaissance, Walt Disney Animation Studios (then known as Walt Disney Feature Animation) was headquartered in the Grand Central Business Centre. Disneytoon Studios, a division of WDAS, is still located in the Grand Central Business Centre near GC3, along with the Animation Research Library, Disney Animation&#x27;s archive.

Following the acquisition of DreamWorks Animation by Comcast and its NBCUniversal subsidiary in 2016, Katzenberg said that &quot;We will absolutely continue to make animated films here.&quot;

In 2002, the city&#x27;s redevelopment agency gave Animation Initiative Glendale six months to develop a viable plan for adapting the historic Fidelity Federal Savings and Loan building for use as an animation museum. These plans were ultimately unsuccessful.

<text>Space Channel 5 is a Rhythm video game developed and published by Sega for the Dreamcast. It was later ported to the PlayStation 2 and Game Boy Advance. Following space-faring reporter Ulala as she investigates an alien invasion, players engage in rhythm-based combat where Ulala mimics the actions of rivals in time to musical tracks.

The game was conceived by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, who was told to create something aimed at a female audience. Production lasted two years, with a staff of around 20 that included company veterans and newcomers to game development. The music, composed by Naofumi Hataya and Kenichi Tokoi, drew inspiration from big band music. Ken Woodman&#x27;s &quot;Mexican Flyer&quot; had informed the musical style and acted as the theme song. The overall style was influenced by culture from the 1950s and 1960s, and the later music videos of Peter Gabriel and Michael Jackson, the latter having a cameo appearance in the game.

While the game was released to low sales, journalists gave the Dreamcast original generally positive reviews; praise focused on its music-central gameplay and art style, but faulted its short length and syncing issues with the graphics. The PS2 version met with similar praise, with many recommending it due to the low selling price. The GBA version, subtitled &quot;Ulala&#x27;s Cosmic Attack&quot;, saw lower scores due to technical shortcomings. The game has since spawned a series of related games and media, beginning with the sequel &quot;Space Channel 5: Part 2&quot;, released in 2002 in Japan and 2003 worldwide.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Space Channel 5&quot; is a music video game in which players take on the role of Ulala, a reporter working for the titular news channel in a 1960s-styled science fiction future filled with competing news channels. When an alien race called the Morolians begin attacking, Ulala simultaneously reports on the events, fights off the threat, and clashes with rival reporters. The invasion is revealed to have been staged by Space Channel 5 boss Chief Blank to drive up ratings for the channel. With help from fellow reporters and support from her fans, Ulala defeats Blank.

Players control Ulala through four stages; real-time polygonal character models and visual effects move in sync to pre-rendered MPEG movies which form the level backgrounds. All gameplay has Ulala mimicking the movements and vocalisations of her opponents (compared by journalists to the game Simon Says). Actions are performed in time to music tracks playing in each section of a stage. There are six buttons that match actions on-screen; the directional pad buttons, and two action buttons (A and B on Dreamcast and Game Boy Advance (GBA), Cross and Circle on PlayStation 2) which are presented with the vocalization &quot;chu&quot;.

Levels are split between &quot;dance&quot; areas and shooting areas. During dance sections, Ulala mimics actions and shouts of &quot;chu&quot; from enemies, with successful actions boosting a &quot;Ratings&quot; meter in the lower right corner of the screen. In combat, Ulala must shoot at and defeat enemies, and also rescue hostages with the other action button. After either a dance or combat section, Ulala is joined in her progress by the people she rescued. During boss battles, Ulala has a health meter represented on-screen as hearts; a heart is lost for each mistake. If Ulala makes too many mistakes and loses all hearts during boss battles, fails to meet the minimum rating requirements, or causes ratings to drop to zero by missing or failing actions, the player reaches a game over and must restart. The game features a new game plus option, where players can begin a new game using a completed save file. Depending on the current rating, alternate routes are unlocked and new enemy patterns appear.

==Development==

The concept for &quot;Space Channel 5&quot; originated when Tetsuya Mizuguchi—then known for his work on racing games—was contacted by Sega to develop a game for the Dreamcast aimed at a female casual gaming demographic. Mizuguchi had no knowledge of such a demographic, so he personally interviewed several young girls to find their tastes in gaming. He discovered that, while male gamers trended towards games that allowed for ranking and high scores, women preferred straight puzzle games. Mizuguchi decided to create a game which would bring together both video game and music fans, using his personal experience with nightclub disco and music events such as Street Parade. He also drew inspiration from the art of Wassily Kandinsky, wanting to encourage a form of synesthesia within players. Other sources of inspiration were the music of the 1950s and 60s, and the music videos of Peter Gabriel and Michael Jackson that were showing on MTV during the 80s. This concept originated in 1993, with full production beginning in 1998 following extensive internal planning and approval by Sega senior staff.

Production was handled by Sega AM9, later known as United Game Artists. The team included many staff from Team Andromeda (makers of &quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot;) and the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series and more who were complete newcomers to game development. Development for the game lasted almost two years. Beginning with a small team of ten, it eventually expanded to 27 members as development progressed. Mizuguchi acted as the game&#x27;s producer, with Takashi Yuda both directing and providing the voice for supporting character Fuze. The game was Mizuguchi&#x27;s first time working on a game aimed exclusively at the home console market, as his earlier work had first been developed for arcade. Speaking about the Dreamcast, Mizuguchi said that it allowed higher-quality music compared to graphics-focused racing games. He wanted to use the new technology to incorporate interactivity into the score. Production was challenging at times due to the balance of gameplay and scenario.

===Design===
The earliest versions of the game were described by Mizuguchi as &quot;very cool, but not so fun&quot;, as players simply pressed buttons in time to the music while a non-interactive video changed. To make the game more interesting, Mizuguchi drew inspiration from the rhythm troope Stomp; a particular piece which inspired him was a segment where a performer would have the audience copy their clapping, with the rhythm becoming more complex over time. Mizuguchi wanted to incorporate this into the game, combining it with a narrative and distinctive music. The rest of the team found it difficult to understand Mizuguchi&#x27;s vision as they were confused by his wish for comedy to be a part of the game&#x27;s style, so he hired a pantomime artist to school the team in physical comedy. The production team also went to a comedy workshop to practise miming and physical comedy routines to further inform their understanding of the game. The name of the game&#x27;s aliens &quot;Morolians&quot; was a derivation of the surname of artist Mayumi Moro; it came about as the team often used her last name around the office. Moro found its use in the game funny.

A key aspect of the game was that while the gameplay involved shooting, Ulala never actually killed anyone, allowing the game to be approachable to a wider range of players. When pitching the gameplay in his design document, Mizuguchi distilled the basic cycle of effort and reward, then came up with a means of realising them in the game. To ensure the team fully understood the gameplay concept of matching button presses to music and character actions, all extraneous effects were stripped away, leaving a basic version the team could focus on. While some animations were created using motion capture, the rest were animated by hand. The vocalization &quot;Chu&quot; emerged during voice recording. The original word was &quot;Shoot&quot;, but the actors had difficulty pronouncing it using the necessary single syllable, resulting in the word being contracted and altered into its current form.

Ulala&#x27;s motion capture actions were performed by Japanese dancer Nazu Nahoko. The Morolians&#x27; movements were scripted by the mime artist Mizuguchi hired to help the team during early production. The idea of streaming polygonal models over CGI movies was suggested by Yuta. They made use of ADX technology to synch the movement of models over the movies. The game content filled just over 99% of the Dreamcast GD-ROM disc. The space usage was attributed by Mizuguchi to the large amount of video and audio streaming used in the game. In hindsight, Mizuguchi cited the use of pre-rendered movies as a challenge to the team. Due to the amount of space used, some planned comedy segments had to be cut. An early tech demo was put together for the game; in this prototype version, the player character was a man, and only the most basic elements of its gameplay and theme were in place. A later version featured a prototype design for Ulala. The game&#x27;s visual aesthetic of a &quot;retro future&quot; was present in that demo, and stayed throughout production. Influences on the characters and art design came from across the production team, with tastes ranging from &quot;Star Wars&quot; to &quot;Doraemon&quot; to Monty Python. Mizuguchi was inspired by the contrasting styles of orchestral music and science fiction setting used in &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

The character of Ulala was a collaborative creation, though much of her design was attributed to the game&#x27;s art director Yumiko Miyabe. Ulala&#x27;s early actions were deemed too &quot;cool and stylish&quot;, and her overall movement too stiff. Her design was also adjusted several times so she would appeal to male gamers (who favored looks) and female gamers (who preferred personality). Another notable artist on the project was Jake Kazdal, who worked as a concept and model artist. Kazdal said that one of Ulala&#x27;s key design inspirations was the titular lead of the science fiction film &quot;Barbarella&quot; (1968). The art style continued to evolve from there, with the staff often laughing at the &quot;sheer ridiculousness&quot; of some later characters. Her costume&#x27;s orange colour was a reference to the Dreamcast logo and signified Sega&#x27;s new direction.

===Audio===
====Music====
The music for &quot;Space Channel 5&quot; was composed by Naofumi Hataya and Kenichi Tokoi of Sega&#x27;s music label WaveMaster. Hataya also acted as sound director. The musical style, inspired by big band jazz of the 1950s and 60s, was one of the earliest elements to be decided upon. Hataya attributed the game&#x27;s musical direction to Mizuguchi&#x27;s guidance throughout production. The musical style changed with each stage, with later sections incorporating techno and trance. The in-game soundtrack mixed CD-quality music with midi sound samples. According to Hataya, one of the hardest aspects of music development was the variety of genres and fitting all the score onto the game disc. Music production ran simultaneously with the game&#x27;s production, with the sound team at first using concept art and in-production gameplay. Late in development, the story caused a lot of additional work for the team. The final total of in-game music was estimated at 70 minutes.

The game&#x27;s main theme was &quot;Mexican Flyer&quot;, composed by Ken Woodman in 1966. Mizuguchi approached Woodman about using the theme. Woodman was surprised that someone wanted to use the theme for a video game. The use of &quot;Mexican Flyer&quot; in the game&#x27;s early presentation video informed the direction of the music. Getting the rights to the track proved difficult, as the track was extremely obscure and had not been used in any media since its release. The ending theme &quot;Pala Paya&quot; used vocals performed by WaveMaster staff. A soundtrack album for the game was published by Marvelous Entertainment and distributed by VAP on February 21, 2000. The album featured 22 tracks, including a remix of &quot;Mexican Flyer&quot;. Tracks from &quot;Space Channel 5&quot; were included in the compilation album &quot;Space Channel 5 20th Anniversary: Gyungyun Selection&quot; by UMA on December 18, 2019.

====Voice cast====
Sega chose not to promote the game&#x27;s voice cast. Most of the voice roles were performed by members of the game&#x27;s staff. This was due to the team wanting full control of how characters were portrayed, and the need to do quick re-recording sessions. Ulala&#x27;s Japanese voice actress was similarly pulled from Sega staff. According to Mizuguchi, the recording process was so strenuous, and his demands so exacting that the actress was brought to tears. Journalist James Mielke attributed Ulala&#x27;s voice to Mineko Okamura. Okamura later confirmed her role, saying her demo voice was kept in the final game after positive feedback from the press. Professionals Show Hayami and Kae Iida were hired for the roles of rival reporters Jaguar and Pudding respectively, with Iida originally being planned for the role of Ulala. Ulala was voiced in English by Apollo Smile, then a notable television personality.

A notable cameo was Michael Jackson himself, featuring in the game as the character &quot;Space Michael&quot;. A long-term collaborator with and fan of Sega, Jackson was shown a near-finished version of the game by Sega staff member Shuji Utsumi. Jackson loved the game and wanted to be featured in it. Mizuguchi initially wanted to refuse the request, as the game was only a month away from completion, but the team wanted to include Jackson, so they substituted a Morolian-controlled NPC character for a model based on Jackson and added moves based on the singer&#x27;s famous dance moves. Initially thinking Jackson would dislike it, Mizuguchi was surprised when Jackson approved, realising the pressures the team were under, and provided voice lines for the character.

==Release==
&quot;Space Channel 5&quot; was first announced at the September 1999 Tokyo Game Show. Nahoko portrayed the character Ulala at live promotional events, including its TGS showings. The game was released in Japan on December 16, 1999. Sega pushed the game&#x27;s release with heavy public promotions and an extensive launch event in Tokyo. The game was supported by several pieces of merchandise. In the US, Sega conducted a contest in Universal City, California titled &quot;Space Channel 5 Ulala-a-like Contest&quot;. The contestants were girls between the ages of 9 and 21 who competed to who could resemble Ulala the best. The contestants were able to meet with Ulala portrayed by Kelly Preston and the winner won $500 and a Dreamcast.

The game&#x27;s localization was handled by Sega, who approached it &quot;with care and time&quot;. One of the key elements for the team was finding the right English voice for Ulala. When the dialogue was localized, there was little difference between regions beyond language-specific nuances. The music itself received little to no changes. The game was released internationally in 2000; it was published in North America on June 6, and in Europe on October 8.

Following their exit from the console market, Sega began moving the &quot;Space Channel 5&quot; franchise onto other systems, beginning with the PlayStation 2. The PS2 version released in Europe on March 15, 2002; and in Japan on December 12 of that year. In North America, the PS2 port was bundled with its sequel and published in the region by Agetec. This version released in North America on November 18. In Japan, the PS2 version has since become a rarity, fetching high resale prices.

A remake for the Game Boy Advance titled &quot;Space Channel 5: Ulala&#x27;s Cosmic Attack&quot; was also produced. This formed part of Sega&#x27;s partnership with THQ to co-develop and co-publish several of their franchises to the platform. The port was co-developed by Art Co., Ltd and THQ. The game was re-created within the GBA hardware, with its music rendered using a MIDI score. The music was handled by Tsutomu Fuzawa. The game was released as a Western exclusive in 2003; it was published on June 17 in North America and September 12 in Europe.

==Reception==
===Dreamcast===
Upon its debut in Japan, the game met with low sales. During its first week, it sold through just over 44% of its stock with over 41,000 units. It eventually sold over 93,600 units in Japan, being among the region&#x27;s top 40 best-selling Dreamcast titles. At a 2002 conference, the game was declared a success by its staff, finding a wide audience among both hardcore and casual gamers. In contrast during a 2005 interview, Mizuguchi said that the game was not a commercial success.

According to video game review aggregator GameRankings, the Dreamcast version earned a score of 84% based on 34 reviews. Japanese gaming magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave the game a score of 29 points out of 40. Pat Garratt of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; gave the game a perfect score, calling it a unique game and &quot;absolute must for every DC owner&quot;. The three reviewers for &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; lauded the soundtrack and art design, but noted issues with its short length and occasional syncing issues. &quot;GamePro&quot; positively compared the gameplay and style to &quot;PaRappa the Rapper&quot; and &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot;, recommending it as a short and enjoyable experience while noting a lack of extras. &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Jeff Gerstmann said &quot;Space Channel 5&quot; was worth playing for its unconventional art style and music, with his main complaints being repetitive gameplay and lack of unlockables.

&quot;GameSpy&quot; called the game &quot;a work of art in every sense of the word&quot;, praising the world and music and calling the game a testament to Sega&#x27;s production skills; their one major problem was the simplistic gameplay style and lack of features beyond the campaign. &quot;IGN&quot; gave both the Japanese original and the Western release near-perfect scores, praising the presentation while criticizing the short length and timing issues. &quot;USA Today&quot; said the game was &quot;all about fun, and [&quot;Space Channel 5&quot;] delivers with a song.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said that &quot;gamers of all ages undoubtedly will want to help Ulala get her groove back — if not get their hands on a pair of those boots.&quot; &quot;Next Generation&quot;″s Greg Orlando called the game &quot;Beautiful and all-too-short&quot;.

&quot;Space Channel 5&quot; was nominated for awards in four categories at the 1999 Japan Game Awards. It was also nominated in the &quot;Animation&quot; and &quot;Console Innovation&quot; categories at the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences&#x27; awards ceremony in 2001. 
&quot;Space Channel 5&quot; and Sega AM9 were nominated at the 2002 BAFTA Awards in the &quot;Best Audio&quot; category, losing to &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot;.

In anniversary retrospectives and lists of favorite Dreamcast titles from multiple websites including &quot;Gamasutra&quot; and &quot;IGN&quot;, &quot;Space Channel 5&quot; has been remembered as one of the most unique titles on the system for its gameplay design and art direction. &quot;1UP.com&quot;, in an article about Mizuguchi&#x27;s work with United Game Artists, &quot;highlight&quot; on the Dreamcast and described as &quot;unlike anything before it.&quot;

===PlayStation 2===
The PlayStation 2 port was met with a similarly positive response. GameRankings gave the North American release a score of 79% based on 7 reviews; and Metacritic gave it a score of 79 out of a possible 100 from 16 reviews, indicating a &quot;generally favorable&quot; reception. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; said that the mixture of music and unique style gave the game &quot;an infectious, addictive quality&quot;. &quot;GamePro&quot; called the &quot;Special Edition&quot; package &quot;easily the best bargain for the PS2 this side of [&quot;Virtua Fighter 4: Evolution&quot;]&quot;. &quot;Game Informer&quot; called the release &quot;a great package crammed with more value and personality than most rhythm games&quot;. Brad Shoemaker of &quot;GameSpot&quot; felt it was a great release due to its low price and having both the original and its sequel.

&quot;GameSpy&quot;″s Christian Nutt lauded the music and its lead character, in addition to the low price for the double game pack, but faulted its length and issues with the localization. &quot;GameZone&quot; recommended the package for fans of &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot;, and said gamers outside its target audience should try it due to its quality and enjoyability. Douglass Perry of &quot;IGN&quot;, comparing the game to its sequel that formed part of the package, felt that the first was the inferior game due to lacking the later additions and polishing. Paul Fitzpatrick of &quot;Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine&quot; felt that the original game&#x27;s flaws were only exacerbated when contrasted with its sequel. Paul Fitzpatrick of &quot;PlayStation Official Magazine – UK&quot; enjoyed the soundtrack and lauded its sense of style, but criticized its length.

===Game Boy Advance===
By contrast, the Game Boy Advance port received a Metacritic score of 55 out of 100 based on 15 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average&quot; reception. &quot;GamePro&quot; was surprised that the game worked on the portable console, praising the efforts of the team while being unable to recommend it to buyers. For Frank Provo of &quot;GameSpot&quot;, the biggest problem was the unresponsive controls, as otherwise, the game was a laudable conversion of the game for the GBA. &quot;GameSpy&quot;″s Steve Steinberg was very critical, calling the game &quot;a barely playable disappointment&quot; despite liking the soundtrack. &quot;GameZone&quot; said that the difficulties with controlling Ulala and presentation made the game suitable only for hardcore series fans. Craig Harris, writing for &quot;IGN&quot;, said that while the gameplay was intact, the other elements were undermined by the technical constraints of the console. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; gave the port a good score, saying that the game&#x27;s core remained intact and enjoyable despite low graphical quality and control issues. &quot;Game Informer&quot; was also positive, saying that there could be no better version of &quot;Space Channel 5&quot; on the platform. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; gave praise to the control responses, but called the graphics &quot;colorful but sparse&quot;.
==Legacy==
===Sequels===

A sequel to &quot;Space Channel 5&quot; was planned from an early stage, but production was put on hold until Western sales figures came in. The sequel, &quot;Space Channel 5: Part 2&quot;, was announced in October 2001. It received a simultaneous release on Dreamcast and PS2 in January 2002 in Japan. The PS2 version was released in mainland Europe the following year. In North America, the game was released as part of &quot;Space Channel 5: Special Edition&quot; by Agetec. It was the last game produced by United Game Artists prior to Sega&#x27;s internal restructuring in 2003. &quot;Part 2&quot; was later given a high-definition port to Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. It was released first as part of the &quot;Dreamcast Collection&quot; in February 2011, then as a standalone digital release in October of the same year.

While concepts existed for a third game in the series and pitches were made for the Wii and Kinect, the team felt they had exhausted their ideas, and Sega showed little interest in a new entry. At one time, Mizuguchi and Q Entertainment were in discussions with Sega about reviving the series for HD consoles. A new virtual reality project was eventually greenlit by Sega. The project was developed by Grounding Inc., a game company founded by former Sega developers including Okamura, who pitched the concept to Sega. Beginning in 2016 as an experimental collaboration with Sega and KDDI titled &quot;Space Channel 5 VR: Ukiuki Viewing Show&quot;, the project saw a strong fan response for a full game. Titled &quot;Space Channel 5 VR: Kinda Funky News Flash&quot;, the player takes the role of novice reporters assisting Ulala during a new invasion report. Originally scheduled for release on PlayStation VR, SteamVR, HTC Vive and Oculus Quest during December 2019, the game was delayed into the following year to improve its quality. All versions were released between February and November 2020.

===Additional media and cameos===
Ulala was used in a collaboration between MTV and Sega to present the &quot;Best Video&quot; award at the MTV Video Music Award ceremony in 2000. Ulala&#x27;s appearance at the event was also used to promote SegaNet during its Dreamcast debut. A CGI television adaptation of &quot;Space Channel 5&quot; was originally planned from SuperMega Media. In addition, Ulala was to have featured on the MTV program slot as an announcer. These MTV collaborations were cancelled mid-production. A film adaptation of the series was announced in August 2022. A collaboration between Sega and Erik Feig&#x27;s Picturestart company, the script is being co-written by Barry Battles and Nir Paniry.

Sega&#x27;s Sonic Team studio also created a mobile application called &quot;Ulala&#x27;s Channel J&quot; for Japanese Vodafone devices in July 2001. The application consisted of several minigames, most themed after the series and specifically &quot;Space Channel 5: Part 2&quot;. Some featured 3D graphics that required higher-specification devices to play. Themed mobile wallpapers and jingles were also included for download. The game shut down in September 2005, with some of its content merged into the Sonic Cafe mobile service.

In 2001, Palisades Toys produced themed merchandise; these included a lunch box, and figures of game characters including boss characters Evila, Pudding, the Morolians, and several variants of Ulala. Japanese action figure company Figma produced two Ulala figures based on her main looks from &quot;Space Channel 5&quot; and its sequel in 2017. United Game Artists&#x27; next game &quot;Rez&quot; featured the Morolian character as a secret playable character. Ulala was featured as a secret character in racing game &quot;Sonic Riders&quot;, a playable character in multiple entries in the &quot;Sega All-Stars&quot; series (alongside Pudding and Blib), part of a themed stage in the Wii re-release of the rhythm game &quot;Samba de Amigo&quot;, and a playable unit in the crossover strategy game &quot;Project X Zone&quot; and its sequel.

===Lawsuit===
In 2003, &quot;Space Channel 5&quot; and its protagonist Ulala were the subject of a lawsuit against Sega from Deee-Lite vocalist Kierin Magenta Kirby. In July 2000, a Sega affiliate contacted Kirby to determine if she was interested in promoting the game in England, utilizing the 1990 Deee-Lite song &quot;Groove Is in the Heart&quot;; Kirby rejected the offer. Kirby alleged that the &quot;Ulala&quot; character was an unauthorized misappropriation of her likeness. During the lawsuit, Sega showed that the game and character had been created and released in Japan between 1997 and 1999. The judge ruled that regardless of when the &quot;Ulala&quot; character was created, the character did not have a close enough resemblance to Kirby to deem misappropriation of likeness. Kirby was obliged to pay Sega&#x27;s legal fees of $608,000 (reduced from $763,000 on request). &quot;Groove Is in the Heart&quot; was later licensed for use in Sega&#x27;s 2008 Wii port of &quot;Samba de Amigo&quot;, used in a section of the game where the Ulala character appears.

With an estimated population of over 18.3 million (U.S. Census Bureau, 2023), it is the second-largest metropolitan area in the country, behind New York, as well as one of the largest megacities in the world.

In addition to being the nexus of the global entertainment industry, including films, television, and recorded music, Greater Los Angeles is also an important center of international trade, education, media, business, tourism, technology, and sports. It is the third-largest metropolitan area by nominal GDP in the world with an economy exceeding $1 trillion in output, behind New York City and Tokyo.

There are three contiguous component urban areas in Greater Los Angeles: the Inland Empire, which can be broadly defined as Riverside and San Bernardino counties; the Ventura/Oxnard metropolitan area (Ventura County); and the Los Angeles metropolitan area (also known as Metropolitan Los Angeles or Metro LA) consisting of Los Angeles and Orange counties only. The Census Bureau designates the latter as the Los Angeles–Long Beach–Anaheim metropolitan statistical area (MSA), the fourth largest metropolitan area in the western hemisphere and the second-largest metropolitan area in the United States, by population of 13 million as of the 2020 U.S. census. It has a total area of . Although San Diego–Tijuana borders the Greater Los Angeles area at San Clemente and Temecula, it is not part of it as the two urban areas are not geographically contiguous due to the presence of Camp Pendleton. However, both form part of the Southern California megalopolis which extends into Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico.

==Definitions==


===Los Angeles metropolitan area===
The Los Angeles metropolitan area is defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget as the Los Angeles–Long Beach–Anaheim, CA Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), with a 2021 population of 12,997,353. The MSA is in turn made up of two &quot;metropolitan divisions&quot;:
* Los Angeles–Long Beach–Glendale, CA Metropolitan Division, coterminous with Los Angeles County (2023 population 9,663,345)
* Anaheim–Santa Ana–Irvine, CA Metropolitan Division, coterminous with Orange County (2023 population 3,135,755)

The MSA is the most populous metropolitan area in the Western United States and second-most populous in the United States. It has at its core the Los Angeles–Long Beach–Anaheim urban area, which had a population of 12,237,376 as of the 2020 census.

===Greater Los Angeles===
The U.S. Census Bureau also defines a wider commercial region based on commuting patterns, the Los Angeles–Long Beach, CA Combined Statistical Area (CSA), more commonly known as the Greater Los Angeles Area, with an estimated population of 18,316,743 in 2023. The total land area of the CSA is 33,955 sq. mi (87,945 km2).

The CSA includes three component metropolitan areas:
* The Los Angeles–Long Beach–Anaheim, CA MSA (2023 pop. 12,799,100), consisting of:
** Los Angeles County, California (2023 pop. 9,663,345)
** Orange County, California (2023 pop. 3,135,755)
* The Oxnard–Thousand Oaks–Ventura, CA MSA, coterminous with Ventura County (2023 pop. 829,590)
* The Riverside–San Bernardino–Ontario, CA MSA (2023 pop. 4,688,053), consisting of:
** Riverside County, California (2023 pop. 2,492,442)
** San Bernardino County, California (2023 pop. 2,195,611)

==History==
Nearly all of the metropolitan area of Greater Los Angeles is located within the homelands of the Tongva, otherwise referred to as Tovaangar.

==Geography==
===Urban form===

Los Angeles has long been famous for its sprawl, but this has to do more with its status in history as the &quot;poster child&quot; of large cities that grew up with suburban-style patterns of development, rather than how it ranks in sprawl among American metro areas today, now that suburban and exurban-style development is present across the country. The Los Angeles–Orange County metro area was the &quot;most&quot; densely populated &quot;urbanized area&quot; (as defined by the United States Census Bureau) in the United States in 2000, with . For comparison, the &quot;New York–Newark&quot; Urbanized Area had a population density of .

Los Angeles&#x27; reputation for sprawl is due to the fact that the city grew from relative obscurity to one of the country&#x27;s ten largest cities (i.e. 10th largest city in 1920), at a time when suburban patterns of growth first became possible due to electric streetcars and automobiles. The city was also the first large American city where, in the 1920s, major clusters of regional employment, shopping, and culture were already being built outside the traditional downtown areas – in edge cities such as Mid-Wilshire, Miracle Mile and Hollywood. This pattern of growth continued ever outward, more so when the freeway system was built starting in the 1950s; thus Greater Los Angeles was the earliest large American metropolitan area with a decentralized structure. Its major commercial, financial, and cultural institutions are geographically dispersed rather than being concentrated in a single downtown or central area. Also, the population density of Los Angeles proper is low (approximately 8,300 people per square mile) when compared to some other large American cities such as New York City (27,500), San Francisco (17,000), Boston (13,300), and Chicago (11,800). Densities are particularly high within a 5-mile radius of downtown, where some neighborhoods exceed 20,000 people per square mile. What gives the entire Los Angeles metro region a high density is the fact that many of the city&#x27;s suburbs and satellite cities have high density rates. Within its urbanized areas, Los Angeles is noted for having small lot sizes and low-rise buildings. Buildings in the area are low when compared to other large cities, mainly due to zoning regulations. Los Angeles became a major city just as the Pacific Electric Railway spread population to smaller cities much as interurbans did in East Coast cities. In the first decades of the twentieth century, the area was marked by a network of fairly dense but separate cities linked by rail. The ascendance of the automobile helped fill in the gaps between these commuter towns with lower-density settlements.

Starting in the early twentieth century, there was a large growth in population on the western edges of the city moving to the San Fernando Valley and out into the Conejo Valley in eastern Ventura County. Many working-class whites migrated to this area during the 1960s and 1970s out of East and Central Los Angeles. As a result, there was a large growth in population into the Conejo Valley and into Ventura County through the US 101 corridor. Making the US 101 a full freeway in the 1960s and expansions that followed helped make commuting to Los Angeles easier and opened the way for development westward. Development in Ventura County and along the US 101 corridor remains controversial, with open-space advocates battling those who feel business development is necessary to economic growth. Although the area still has abundant amount of open space and land, almost all of it was put aside and mandated never to be developed as part of the master plan of each city. Because of this, the area which was once a relatively inexpensive area to buy real estate, saw rising real estate prices well into the 2000s. Median home prices in the Conejo Valley for instance, ranged from $700,000 to $2.2 million in 2003. According to Forbes, &quot;it&#x27;s nearly impossible&quot; to find reasonably priced real estate in California, and the prices will continue to increase.

The Los Angeles area continues to grow, principally on the periphery where new, cheaper, undeveloped areas are being sought. As such, in these areas, populations as well as housing prices exploded, although the housing bubble popped late in the decade of the 2000s. Riverside and San Bernardino counties, which contain large swaths of desert, attracted most of the population increase between 2000 and 2006. Growth continues not only outside the existing urbanized area but also adjacent to existing development in the central areas. As in virtually all US core cities, there is now vigorous residential development in the downtown area with both new buildings and renovation of former office buildings. The &quot;Los Angeles Downtown News&quot; keeps a list of ongoing development projects, updated every quarter. Over the course of the 21st century, droughts and wildfires have increased in frequency and the region&#x27;s water security has become a development issue.

===Major business districts and edge cities===
The traditional business district and historical downtown of Greater Los Angeles is Downtown Los Angeles. However, most commercial activity is found outside downtown Los Angeles in the edge cities of Century City, Wilshire Boulevard in Koreatown, Hollywood, the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood, Universal City, the Warner Center in Woodland Hills, and Sherman Oaks and Encino, notable for existing alongside extensive suburban development.

In fact, the Los Angeles area is considered a classic example of a metropolitan area that developed in such fashion. 

Furthermore, since the COVID-19 pandemic Downtown Los Angeles has experienced staggering commercial vacancy rates, urban blight, homelessness, drug use, and crime. Entire skyscrapers were reportedly sold for less than large estates in Bel Air. 

Within the broader county of Los Angeles and metro area, areas such as Downtown Long Beach, downtown Pasadena, downtown Glendale, and downtown Burbank, Downtown Santa Ana, Downtown Anaheim, Downtown Riverside, Downtown San Bernardino, downtown Irvine, and downtown Ontario are notable.

===Identity===
Employment is not only in the downtown area, but consistently occurs outside the central core. As such, many people commute throughout the city and suburbs in various directions for their work and daily activities, with a large portion heading to the municipalities that are outside the city of Los Angeles.

Unlike most metropolitan areas, regional identity remains a contentious issue in the Greater Los Angeles area, with many residents not acknowledging any association with the region as a whole. For example, while Los Angeles County and Orange County together make up the smaller MSA region, the two host many sub-areas that each have sharp demographic, political, and financial distinctions. South Orange County residents often attempt to be identified apart from Los Angeles although they make up the same metropolitan area. Also, while only 1.63% of Los Angeles residents commute to Orange County for work, over 6% of Orange County commuters head to Los Angeles for work. Western Riverside County and San Bernardino County have become commuter regions characteristic of other suburban counties throughout the nation. Residents in these counties often commute to Los Angeles County and Orange County for employment.

==Component counties, subregions, and cities==
===Los Angeles County===

Los Angeles County, of which the City of Los Angeles is the county seat, is the most populous county in the United States and is home to over a quarter of all California residents. The large size of the city of Los Angeles, as well as its history of annexing smaller towns, has made city boundaries in the central area of Los Angeles County quite complicated. Many cities are completely surrounded by the city of Los Angeles and are often included in the city&#x27;s areas despite being independent municipalities. For example, Santa Monica and Beverly Hills (which is almost completely surrounded by Los Angeles) are considered part of the Westside, while Hawthorne and Inglewood are associated with South L.A. Adjacent areas that are outside the actual city boundaries of incorporated Los Angeles but border the city itself include the Santa Clarita Valley, the San Gabriel Valley, South Bay, and the Gateway Cities.

Despite the large footprint of the city of Los Angeles, a majority of the land area within Los Angeles County is unincorporated and under the primary jurisdiction of Los Angeles County. Much of this land, however, cannot be easily developed due to planning challenges presented by geographic features such as the Santa Monica Mountains, the San Gabriel Mountains, and the Mojave Desert. Actual land development in these regions occurs on the fringes of incorporated cities, some of which have been fully developed, such as the cities of Palmdale and Lancaster.

====Subregions in Los Angeles County====
While there is not an official designation for the regions that comprise Greater Los Angeles, one authority, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, divides the area into the following regions:
* Angeles Forest
* Antelope Valley
* Central L.A. (Downtown Los Angeles, Hollywood, Mid-Wilshire, etc.)
* Eastside
* Gateway Cities/Harbor Area
* Northeast L.A. (Highland Park, Eagle Rock, etc.)
* Northwest L.A. County (including the Santa Clarita Valley)
* Pomona Valley (partially in San Bernardino County)
* San Fernando Valley
* San Gabriel Valley
* Santa Clarita Valley
* Santa Monica Mountains (Malibu, Topanga, etc.)
* South Bay (incl. Palos Verdes Peninsula, Beach Cities)
* South Los Angeles
* Southeast Los Angeles County (including Norwalk and Whittier, see Gateway Cities)
* The Verdugos (including Glendale, Pasadena and the Crescenta Valley)
* Westside

Some of the above areas can be defined as being bounded by natural features such as mountains or the ocean; others are marked by city boundaries, freeways, or other constructed landmarks. For example, Downtown Los Angeles is the area of Los Angeles roughly enclosed by three freeways and one river: the Harbor Freeway (SR 110) to the west, the Santa Ana Freeway (US 101) to the north, the Los Angeles River to the east, and the Santa Monica Freeway (I-10) to the south. Meanwhile, the San Fernando Valley (&quot;The Valley&quot;) is defined as the basin consisting of the part of Los Angeles and its suburbs that lie north-northwest of downtown and is ringed by mountains.

===Orange County===

Orange County was originally an agricultural area dependent on citrus crops, avocados, and oil extraction, and became a bedroom community for Los Angeles when I–5, the Santa Ana Freeway, linked it to the city in the 1950s. The growth of Los Angeles initially fueled population growth in Orange County, but by the 1970s it had become an important economic center in its own right, with tourism and electronics industries, among others. Today, Orange County is known for its tourist attractions, such as Disneyland, Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm, its several pristine beaches and coastline, and its wealthier areas, featured in television shows such as &quot;The O.C.&quot; None of the original downtowns serves as the central urban core for the county, but there are important clusters of business and culture in Downtown Santa Ana and in three edge cities: the Anaheim–Santa Ana edge city from Disneyland to the Orange Crush interchange (Orange, Santa Ana), the South Coast Plaza–John Wayne Airport edge city (Santa Ana, Costa Mesa, Irvine), and Irvine&#x27;s Spectrum edge city.

Orange County is sometimes figuratively divided into &quot;North County&quot; and &quot;South County&quot;, with North Orange County including cities such as Anaheim, Fullerton, and Santa Ana, and is the older, more ethnically diverse and more densely built-up area both geographically and culturally closer to Los Angeles. South County, defined variously as beginning with either Costa Mesa or Irvine and includes cities to the east and south such as Laguna Beach, Mission Viejo, Newport Beach, and San Clemente, is more residential, affluent, recently developed, and has a mostly white population. Irvine is an exception, as it is a center of employment and is ethnically diverse. A growing alternative dividing marker between north and south is the El Toro Y interchange. Orange Coast or South Coast area is defined instead as consisting of some or all of the cities lining the coast.

===Inland Empire===
The Inland Empire, consisting of San Bernardino and Riverside Counties, contains fast-growing suburbs of the region, with a large to majority percentage of the working population commuting to either Los Angeles or Orange Counties for work. Originally an important center for citrus production, the region became an important industrial area by the early 20th century. The Inland Empire also became a key transportation center following the completion of Route 66, and later Interstate 10. With the post-World War II economic boom leading to rapid development in Los Angeles and Orange Counties, land developers bulldozed acres of agricultural land to build suburbs in order to accommodate the Los Angeles area&#x27;s expanding population. The development of a regional freeway system facilitated the expansion of suburbs and human migration linking the Inland Empire and rest of Greater Los Angeles. Despite being primarily suburban, the Inland Empire is also home to important warehousing, shipping, logistics and retail industries, centered on the subregion&#x27;s major cities of Riverside, San Bernardino and Ontario.

While the Inland Empire is sometimes defined as the entirety of San Bernardino and Riverside Counties, the eastern undeveloped, desert portions of these counties are not considered to be part of Greater Los Angeles. The state of California defines this area to include the cities of Adelanto, Apple Valley, and Victorville to the north, the Riverside–San Diego county line to the south, and the towns of Anza, Idyllwild, and Lucerne Valley, along with the San Bernardino National Forest to the east.

Additionally, the southwest portion of Riverside County, centered on the city of Temecula is more economically linked to San Diego county, with its growth largely being driven by migrants from San Diego seeking more affordable housing similar to how northwestern Riverside county&#x27;s growth was driven by migrants from Orange County and Los Angeles seeking more affordable housing.

However, with clear northern and southern limits to expansion, the region&#x27;s urban eastern boundaries have become increasingly nebulous as suburban sprawl continues to spread out to form a unified whole with Los Angeles, with further development encroaching past the San Bernardino and San Jacinto Mountains and into the outlying desert areas. As a result, the regional definition of Greater Los Angeles can now be extended to include Barstow and surrounding towns in the northeast, the Morongo Basin in the east-central including Yucca Valley and Twentynine Palms, and the Coachella Valley cities in the southeast. This interconnectivity, provided by one of the most extensive freeway systems in the world, as well as economic, social and media ties, has blended boundaries between these regions and the urbanized Los Angeles and Inland Empire areas.

====Subregions in the Inland Empire====
* High Desert (includes Antelope Valley in Los Angeles County plus Victor Valley and Morongo Basin)
* Low Desert (Coachella Valley, Palm Springs and Palm Desert area)
* San Bernardino Mountains (Lake Arrowhead and Big Bear Lake area)
* Northwest Riverside County (Corona, Norco, Jurupa Valley, and Riverside area)
* Moreno Valley (Moreno Valley and Perris)
* Pomona Valley (Pomona, Rancho Cucamonga, Chino, Eastvale, Upland, Claremont, Montclair, La Verne and Ontario area. Partially in Los Angeles County)
* San Bernardino Valley (San Bernardino, Fontana, Rialto, Colton, Loma Linda, Highland, and Redlands area)
* San Gorgonio Pass (Banning, Yucaipa, Calimesa, and Beaumont area)
* San Jacinto Valley (Hemet and San Jacinto area)
* Temecula Valley (Lake Elsinore, Menifee, Murrieta, Wildomar, and Temecula area)

====Edge cities in the Inland Empire====

====Sparsely populated areas in the Inland Empire====
While the above areas are included in the regional definition of Greater Los Angeles, the U.S. Census Bureau defines Greater Los Angeles, or officially, the Los Angeles–Long Beach Combined Statistical Area, to include both the above-mentioned areas along with the entirety of San Bernardino and Riverside counties. These areas are sparsely developed and are part of the Mojave and Colorado Deserts. To the north, Interstate 15 crosses desolate desert landscape after passing Barstow, linking Greater Los Angeles with Las Vegas, with Baker being the only significant outpost along the route. To the east, lie the Mojave National Preserve and Joshua Tree National Park along with the towns of Needles and Blythe on the California-Arizona border.

===Ventura County===
Ventura County is mostly suburban and rural and also has developed primarily through the growth of Los Angeles. Central and southern Ventura County formerly consisted of small towns along the Pacific Coast until the expansion of U.S. Route 101 drew in commuters from the San Fernando Valley. Master-planned cities soon began developing, and the county became increasingly urbanized. The northern part of the county, however, remains largely undeveloped and is mostly within the Los Padres National Forest.

=== Urban areas within ===

At the core of the Los Angeles–Long Beach combined statistical area (CSA) lies the Los Angeles–Long Beach–Anaheim, CA urban area, the second most populous in the United States. Within the boundaries of the CSA the Census Bureau defines 30 other urban areas as well, two of which (Riverside–San Bernardino and Oxnard–Ventura) form the core of their own metropolitan areas separate from the Los Angeles metropolitan statistical area. Urban areas situated primarily outside the Los Angeles metropolitan statistical area but within the CSA are identified with a cross (†) in the table below.

According to the 2020 census, there were 18,644,680 people living in the Greater Los Angeles Area. The racial makeup of the area was 29.4% White (23.0% Non-Hispanic European and 6.4% Non-Hispanic Middle Eastern), 13.8% Asian (Non-Hispanic), 0.2% Pacific Islander (Non-Hispanic), 6.1% African American (Non-Hispanic), 0.2% Native American (Non-Hispanic), 0.5% from other races (Non-Hispanic), and 3.3% from two or more races (Non-Hispanic). 46.3% of the population were Hispanic of any race, a super-majority of which was of Mexican origin. 29.4% of the population (5.5 million) was foreign born; most immigrants came from Latin America and Asia.

The explosive growth of the region in the 20th century can be attributed to its favorable Mediterranean climate, the availability of land and many booming industries such as oil, automobile and rubber, motion pictures, intermodal, logistics, and aerospace which in turn attracted millions of people from all over the United States and world. Citrus production was important to the region&#x27;s development in the earlier part of the 20th century.

While the New York metropolitan area is presently the most populous metropolitan area in the United States, it has been predicted in the past that Greater Los Angeles will eventually surpass Greater New York in population. Whether this will happen is yet to be seen, but past predictions on this event have been off the mark. A 1966 article in &quot;Time&quot; predicted Greater Los Angeles would surpass New York by 1975, and that by 1990, would reach close to the 19 million mark. But the article&#x27;s flawed definition of Greater Los Angeles included San Diego, which is actually its own metropolitan area. A 1989 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; predicted Greater Los Angeles would surpass Greater New York by 2010, but the article predicted the population would be 18.3 million in that year, a number Greater New York already surpassed in 2007 by half a million people. By 2009, the New York metropolitan area had a population of 22.2 million compared to the Greater Los Angeles Area&#x27;s 18.7 million, about a 3.56 million persons difference. Percentage growth, however, has been higher in Greater Los Angeles over the past few decades than in Greater New York.

Below is a list of many ethnic enclaves present in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.
==Politics==
Greater Los Angeles is a politically divided metropolitan area. During the 1970s and 1980s, the region leaned toward the Republican Party. Los Angeles County, the most populous of the region, is a Democratic stronghold, although it voted twice for both Richard Nixon (1968 and 1972) and Ronald Reagan (1980 and 1984). Riverside County, San Bernardino County, and Orange County have historically leaned toward the Republican Party but have started shifting leftward in recent years. Ventura County is politically divided.

==Economy==

The Los Angeles metropolitan area has the third-largest metropolitan economy in the world, behind the Greater Tokyo Area and the New York metropolitan area. In 2022, the combined statistical area of Greater Los Angeles (which includes the Los Angeles metropolitan area, the Inland Empire, and Ventura County) had a $1.528 trillion economy.

Los Angeles and Orange Counties together have an economy of roughly $1.227 trillion. Important are coastal California land values and the rents they command, which contribute heavily to GDP earnings, though there are worries that these high land values contribute to the long-term problem of housing affordability and are thus a possible risk to future GDP increase. This is evident when comparing the coast with the Inland Empire, a large component of the five-county combined statistical area (CSA) that nevertheless contributes a far smaller portion to regional gross metropolitan product but still dominates in industry. The Greater Los Angeles CSA is the third-largest economic center in the world, after Greater Tokyo and the New York-Newark-Bridgeport CSA.

Greater Los Angeles is a hotspot for Asian car manufacturers. Specifically, Mitsubishi, Hyundai, Honda, and Mazda have their U.S. headquarters in the area. Nissan and Toyota were headquartered in the area in the recent past as well. (Nissan moved to Tennessee; Toyota moved to Texas.)
The economy of the Los Angeles metropolitan area is famously and heavily based on the entertainment industry, with a particular focus on television, motion pictures, interactive games, and recorded music – the Hollywood district of Los Angeles and its surrounding areas are known as the &quot;movie capital of the United States&quot; due to the region&#x27;s extreme commercial and historical importance to the American motion picture industry. Other significant sectors include shipping/international trade – particularly at the adjacent Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach, together comprising the United States&#x27; busiest seaport – logistics – the Inland Empire being the largest concentration of warehousing and intermodal facilities in the world – as well as aerospace, technology, petroleum, fashion and apparel, and tourism.

The City of Los Angeles is was previous home to five Fortune 500 companies: energy company Occidental Petroleum (until 2014 when it moved its headquarters to Houston), healthcare provider Health Net, metals distributor Reliance Steel &amp; Aluminum, engineering firm AECOM, and real estate group CB Richard Ellis. As of 2024, all of these companies have moved elsewhere. Other companies headquartered in Los Angeles include American Apparel, City National Bank, 20th Century Studios, Latham &amp; Watkins, Univision, Metro Interactive, LLC, Premier America, Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, DeviantArt, Guess?, O&#x27;Melveny &amp; Myers; Paul, Hastings, Janofsky &amp; Walker, Tokyopop, The Jim Henson Company, Paramount Pictures, Sunkist Growers, Incorporated, Tutor Perini, Fox Sports Net, Capital Group, and The Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf. Korean Air&#x27;s US passenger and cargo operations headquarters are in two separate offices in Los Angeles. Entertainment and media giant The Walt Disney Company is headquartered in nearby Burbank.

 The Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach together comprise the fifth-busiest port in the world, being the center of imports and exports for trade on the west Pacific Coast as well as being one of the most significant ports of the western hemisphere. The Port of Los Angeles occupies of land and water along of waterfront and is the busiest container port in the United States. The Port is the busiest port in the United States by container volume, the 8th busiest container port in the world. The top trading partners in 2004 were: China ($68.8 billion), Japan ($24.1 billion), Taiwan ($10.8 billion), Thailand ($6.7 billion), &amp; South Korea ($5.6 billion)

The Port of Long Beach is the second-busiest container port in the United States. It adjoins the separate Port of Los Angeles. Acting as a major gateway for U.S.-Asian trade, the port occupies of land with of waterfront in the city of Long Beach, California. The seaport has approximately $100 billion in trade and provides more than 316,000 jobs in Southern California. The Port of Long Beach imports and exports more than $100 billion worth of goods every year. The seaport provides the country with jobs, generates tax revenue, and supports retail and manufacturing businesses.

===Los Angeles County Metro===
The Los Angeles Metro Rail is the mass transit rail system of Los Angeles County. It is run by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority and its system runs six rail lines throughout Los Angeles County. Metro Rail currently operates four light rail and two rapid transit lines, altogether totaling of rail, 101 stations, and over 360,000 daily weekday boardings .
* The A Line – light rail
* The B Line – rapid transit
* The C Line – light rail
* The D Line – rapid transit
* The E Line – light rail
* The G Line – bus rapid transit
* The J Line – bus rapid transit
* The K Line – light rail

The system&#x27;s light rail lines are the second busiest LRT system in the United States, after Boston, by number of riders, with 200,300 average weekday boardings during the third quarter of 2012. By 2019, it had become the most heavily ridden light rail system in the country.

Since the region of the city is in close proximity to a major fault area the tunnels were built to resist earthquakes of up to magnitude 7.5. Both subway lines use an electrified third rail to provide power to the trains, rendering these lines unusable on the other three. The Blue and Gold Lines run mostly at grade, with some street-running, elevated, and underground stretches in the more densely populated areas of Los Angeles. The Green Line is entirely grade separated, running in the median of I-105 and then turning southward along an elevated route.

The rail lines run regularly on a 5 am and midnight schedule, seven days a week. Limited service on particular segments is provided after midnight and before 5 am There is no rail service between 2 and 3:30 am Exact times vary from route to route; see individual route articles for more information.

===Other authorities===
In addition to Metro, other providers provide local service within their jurisdictions. These include the Orange County Transportation Authority, San Bernardino County Transportation Authority, and Riverside Transit Agency.

===Regional and commuter rail===

There are two providers of heavy rail transportation in the region, Amtrak and Metrolink. Amtrak provides service to San Diego, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, and points in between on the Pacific Surfliner. It also provides long-distance routes, including the Coast Starlight which goes to the San Francisco Bay Area, Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington; the Southwest Chief which goes to Flagstaff, Arizona, Albuquerque, New Mexico, Kansas City, Missouri and Chicago; and the Sunset Limited which provides limited service (three days a week) to Tucson, El Paso, Houston, and New Orleans.

Metrolink provides service to numerous places within Southern California, including all counties in the region. Metrolink operates to 67 stations on eight lines within Southern California which mostly (except for the Inland Empire–Orange County Line and Arrow) radiate from Los Angeles Union Station

For over twenty years the Los Angeles area media market lacked a National Football League team. After the 1994 season, the Los Angeles Rams moved to St. Louis, Missouri, and the Los Angeles Raiders returned to their original home of Oakland, California, due to the lack of an up-to-date NFL stadium. After numerous stadium proposals between 1995 and 2016 in an attempt to bring the NFL back, the Oakland Raiders, St. Louis Rams, and San Diego Chargers all submitted plans to relocate back to Los Angeles after the 2015 NFL season. On January 12, 2016, the Rams were approved to move to Los Angeles and build the venue eventually known as SoFi Stadium with the Chargers or Raiders given the option to join them. On January 12, 2017, the Chargers announced their move to Los Angeles to join the Rams. Both teams share SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California.

<text>Françoise d&#x27;Eaubonne (; 12 March 1920 – 3 August 2005) was a French author, labour rights activist, environmentalist, and feminist. Her 1974 book, &quot;Le Féminisme ou la Mort&quot;, introduced the term ecofeminism. She co-founded the Front homosexuel d&#x27;action révolutionnaire, a homosexual revolutionary alliance in Paris.

== Life and career ==
Her mother was a teacher, a child of a Carlist revolutionary. Her father was an anarcho-syndicalist and the secretary general of an insurance company. Both of her parents were members of the religious Sillon movement. When she was at the age of 16, the Spanish Civil War broke out. Later, she would express her feelings in this period of her life with the title &quot;Chienne de Jeunesse&quot;.

A member of the French Communist Party from 1945-1957, in 1971, she co-founded the Front homosexuel d&#x27;action révolutionnaire (FHAR), a homosexual revolutionary movement. Also that year, she signed the Manifesto of the 343 declaring she had an abortion. She is considered the founder of the ecological and social movement of ecofeminism. She created the Ecology-Feminism (Ecologie-Feminisme) Center in Paris in 1972. In 1974 she published her book &quot;Le féminisme ou la mort&quot; (Feminism or Death) where she first coined the term ecofeminism. In the book, she speaks of a special connection women share with nature and encourages women&#x27;s environmental activism. She cites toxic masculinity as the cause of population growth, pollution, and other destructive influences on the environment. Many scholars shared d&#x27;Eaubonne&#x27;s view on women&#x27;s inherent connection to nature. These scholars include Sherry Ortner, Rosemary Radford Ruether, Susan Griffin, and Carolyn Merchant.

Following her motto, &quot;Not a day without a line&quot;, Françoise d&#x27;Eaubonne wrote more than 50 works, from &quot;Colonnes de l&#x27;âme&quot; (poetry, 1942) to &quot;L&#x27;Évangile de Véronique&quot; (essay, 2003). Her historical novel &quot;Comme un vol de gerfauts&quot; (1947) was translated into English as &quot;A Flight of Falcons&quot;, and extracts from her essay &quot;Feminism or Death&quot; appeared in the 1974 anthology &quot;New French Feminisms&quot;. She also wrote science fiction novels, like &quot;L&#x27;échiquier du temps&quot; and &quot;Rêve de feu&quot;, &quot;Le sous-marin de l&#x27;espace&quot;.

<text>A pinhole camera is a simple camera without a lens but with a tiny aperture (the so-called &quot;pinhole&quot;)—effectively a light-proof box with a small hole in one side. Light from a scene passes through the aperture and projects an inverted image on the opposite side of the box, which is known as the camera obscura effect. The size of the images depends on the distance between the object and the pinhole. 

A Worldwide Pinhole Photography Day is observed on the last Sunday of April, every year.

==History==
===Camera obscura===

The camera obscura or pinhole image is a natural optical phenomenon. Early known descriptions are found in the Chinese Mozi writings (circa 500 BCE) and the Aristotelian &quot;Problems&quot; (circa 300 BCE – 600 CE).
Ibn al-Haytham (965–1039), an Arab physicist also known as Alhazen, described the camera obscura effect. Over the centuries others started to experiment with it, mainly in dark rooms with a small opening in shutters, mostly to study the nature of light and to safely watch solar eclipses.

Giambattista Della Porta wrote in 1558 in his Magia Naturalis about using a concave mirror to project the image onto paper and to use this as a drawing aid. However, at about the same time, the use of a lens instead of a pinhole was introduced. In the 17th century, the camera obscura with a lens became a popular drawing aid that was further developed into a mobile device, first in a little tent and later in a box. The photographic camera, as developed early in the 19th century, was basically an adaptation of the box-type camera obscura with a lens.

The term &quot;pin-hole&quot; in the context of optics was found in James Ferguson&#x27;s 1764 book &quot;Lectures on select subjects in mechanics, hydrostatics, pneumatics, and optics&quot;.

===Early pinhole photography===

The first known description of pinhole photography is found in the 1856 book &quot;The Stereoscope&quot; by Scottish inventor David Brewster, including the description of the idea as &quot;a camera without lenses, and with only a pin-hole&quot;.

Sir William Crookes and William de Wiveleslie Abney were other early photographers to try the pinhole technique.

===Film and integral photography experiments===
According to inventor William Kennedy Dickson, the first experiments directed at moving pictures by Thomas Edison and his researchers took place around 1887 and involved &quot;microscopic pin-point photographs, placed on a cylindrical shell&quot;. The size of the cylinder corresponded with their phonograph cylinder as they wanted to combine the moving images with sound recordings. Problems arose in recording clear pictures &quot;with phenomenal speed&quot; and the &quot;coarseness&quot; of the photographic emulsion when the pictures were enlarged. The microscopic pin-point photographs were soon abandoned. In 1893 the Kinetoscope was finally introduced with moving pictures on celluloid film strips. The camera that recorded the images, dubbed &quot;Kinetograph&quot;, was fitted with a lens.

Eugène Estanave experimented with integral photography, exhibiting a result in 1925 and publishing his findings in &quot;La Nature&quot;. After 1930 he chose to continue his experiments with pinholes replacing the lenticular screen.

==Usage==

The image of a pinhole camera may be projected onto a translucent screen for a real-time viewing (used for safe observation of solar eclipses) or to trace the image on paper. But it is more often used without a translucent screen for pinhole photography with photographic film or photographic paper placed on the surface opposite to the pinhole aperture.

A common use of pinhole photography is to capture the movement of the sun over a long period of time. This type of photography is called solarigraphy. Pinhole photography is used for artistic reasons, but also for educational purposes to let pupils learn about, and experiment with, the basics of photography.

Pinhole cameras with CCDs (charge-coupled devices) are sometimes used for surveillance because they are difficult to detect.

Related cameras, image forming devices, or developments from it include Franke&#x27;s widefield pinhole camera, the pinspeck camera, and the pinhead mirror.

Modern manufacturing has enabled the production of high quality pinhole lenses which may be used with digital cameras.

== Construction ==

Pinhole cameras can be handmade by the photographer for a particular purpose. In its simplest form, a pinhole camera includes a light-tight box with a pinhole in one end, and a piece of film or other light-sensitive material at the other end. Suitable containers include empty cylindrical cans, with one open end having a removable lid to facilitate loading film, and the other (closed) end equipped with the pinhole. Instructions for building a pinhole camera were published by Kodak, using either a 126 film cartridge or an empty can. The pinhole may be punched or drilled using a sewing needle or small diameter bit through a piece of aluminum foil or thin aluminum or brass sheet. This piece is then taped to the inside of the light-tight box, behind a hole cut or drilled through one end of the box. A flap of cardboard covering the pinhole, hinged with a piece of adhesive tape, can be used as a shutter. The interior of an effective pinhole camera is painted black to suppress internal stray light reflections.

Pinhole cameras can be constructed with a sliding film holder or back to adjust the distance between the film and the pinhole. This effectively changes the focal length, which affects both the angle of view and also the effective f-stop ratio. Moving the film closer to the pinhole will result in a wide angle field of view and shorter exposure time. Moving the film farther away from the pinhole will result in a telephoto or narrow-angle view and longer exposure time.

Instead of simple household materials, pinhole cameras also can be constructed by replacing the lens assembly in a conventional camera with a pinhole. In particular, compact 35 mm cameras whose lens and focusing assembly have been damaged can be reused as pinhole cameras, maintaining the use of the shutter and film winding mechanisms. As a result of the enormous increase in f-number, to maintain similar exposure times, the photographer must use a fast film in direct sunshine or other bright light conditions. Homemade or commercial pinholes also can be used in place of the lens on a single lens reflex camera (SLR) or mirrorless interchangeable lens camera. Use with a digital SLR allows metering and composition by trial and error, and since development is effectively free, it is a popular way to try pinhole photography.

=== Selection of pinhole size ===
Up to a certain point, the smaller the hole, the sharper the image, but the dimmer the projected image. Optimally, the diameter of the aperture should be less than or equal to of the distance between it and the projected image.

Within limits, a small pinhole through a thin surface will result in a sharper image resolution because the projected circle of confusion at the image plane is practically the same size as the pinhole. An extremely small hole, however, can produce significant diffraction effects and a less clear image due to the wave properties of light. Additionally, vignetting occurs as the diameter of the hole approaches the thickness of the material in which it is punched, because the sides of the hole obstruct the light entering at anything other than 90 degrees.

The best pinhole is perfectly round (since irregularities cause higher-order diffraction effects) and in an extremely thin piece of material. Industrially produced pinholes benefit from laser etching, but a hobbyist can still produce pinholes of sufficiently high quality for photographic work.

A method of calculating the optimal pinhole diameter was first published by Joseph Petzval in 1857. The smallest possible diameter of the image point and therefore the highest possible image resolution and the sharpest image are given when:
:formula_1
where
: is the pinhole diameter
: is the distance from pinhole to image plane or &quot;focal length&quot;
: is the wavelength of light 

The first to apply wave theory to the problem was Lord Rayleigh in 1891. But due to some incorrect and arbitrary deductions he arrived at:
:formula_2 
So his optimal pinhole was approximatively % bigger than Petzval&#x27;s.

Another optimum pinhole size, proposed by Young (1971), uses the Fraunhofer approximation of the diffraction pattern behind a circular aperture, resulting in:
:formula_3

This may be simplified to: formula_4, assuming that and are measured in millimetres and is 550 nm, corresponding to the central (yellow-green) wavelength of visible light. For a pinhole-to-film distance of , this works out to a pinhole of  mm in diameter. For = 50 mm the optimal diameter is  mm. The equivalent f-stop value is .

The depth of field is basically infinite, but this does not mean that no optical blurring occurs. The infinite depth of field means that image blur depends not on object distance but on other factors, such as the distance from the aperture to the film plane, the aperture size, the wavelength(s) of the light source, and motion of the subject or canvas. Additionally, pinhole photography can not avoid the effects of haze.

===Basis for optimum pinhole size===

In the 1970s, Young measured the resolution limit of the pinhole camera as a function of pinhole diameter and later published a tutorial in &quot;The Physics Teacher&quot;. He defined and plotted two normalized variables: the normalized resolution limit, formula_5, and the normalized focal length, formula_6, where
: is the resolution limit
: is the pinhole radius (/2)
: is the focal length
: is the wavelength of the light, typically about 550 nm.

On the left-side of the graph (where the normalized focal length is less than 0.65), the pinhole is large, and geometric optics applies; the normalized resolution limit is approximately constant at a value of 1.5, meaning the actual resolution limit is approximately 1.5 times the radius of the pinhole, independent of the normalized focal length. (Spurious resolution is also seen in the geometric-optics limit.)

On the right-side (normalized focal length is greater than 1), the pinhole is small, and Fraunhofer diffraction applies; the resolution limit is given by the far-field diffraction formula shown in the graph, which increases as the pinhole size decreases, assuming that and are constant:
:formula_7
In this version of formula as published by Young, the radius of the pinhole is used rather than its diameter, so the constant is 0.61 instead of the more usual 1.22.

In the center of the plot (normalized focal length is between 0.65 and 1), which is the region of near-field diffraction (or Fresnel diffraction), the pinhole focuses the light slightly, and the resolution limit is minimized when the normalized focal length is equal to one. That is, the actual focal length (the distance between the pinhole and the film plane) is equal to formula_8. At this focal length, the pinhole focuses the light slightly, and the normalized resolution limit is approximately , i.e., the resolution limit is ~ of the radius of the pinhole. The pinhole, in this case, is equivalent to a Fresnel zone plate with a single zone. The value 2/ is in a sense the natural focal length of the pinhole.

The relation = 2/ yields an optimum pinhole diameter = 2, so the experimental value differs slightly from the estimate of Petzval, above.

=== Calculating the f-number and required exposure ===
The f-number of the camera may be calculated by dividing the distance from the pinhole to the imaging plane (the focal length) by the diameter of the pinhole. For example, a camera with a 0.5 mm diameter pinhole, and a 50 mm focal length would have an f-number of 50/0.5, or 100 (&quot;f&quot;/100 in conventional notation).

Due to the large f-number of a pinhole camera, exposures will often encounter reciprocity failure. Once exposure time has exceeded about 1 second for film or 30 seconds for paper, one must compensate for the breakdown in linear response of the film/paper to intensity of illumination by using longer exposures.

Exposures projected on to modern light-sensitive photographic film can typically range from five seconds up to as much as several hours, with smaller pinholes requiring longer exposures to produce the same size image. Because a pinhole camera requires a lengthy exposure, its shutter may be manually operated, as with a flap made of opaque material to cover and uncover the pinhole.

==Natural pinhole phenomenon==

A pinhole camera effect can sometimes occur naturally. Small &quot;pinholes&quot; formed by the gaps between overlapping tree leaves will create replica images of the sun on flat surfaces. During an eclipse, this produces small crescents in the case of a partial eclipse, or hollow rings in the case of an annular eclipse. Disco balls can also function as natural reflective pinhole cameras (also known as a pinhead mirror).

<text>The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) is a large-scale physics experiment and observatory designed to detect cosmic gravitational waves and to develop gravitational-wave observations as an astronomical tool. Prior to LIGO, all data about the universe has come in the form of light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation, from limited direct exploration on relatively nearby Solar System objects such as the Moon, Mars, Venus, Jupiter and their moons, asteroids etc, and from high energy cosmic particles. Initially, two large observatories were built in the United States with the aim of detecting gravitational waves by laser interferometry. Two additional, smaller gravity wave observatories are now operational in Japan (KAGRA) and Italy (Virgo). The two LIGO observatories use mirrors spaced four kilometers apart to measure changes in length—over an effective span of 1120 km—of less than one ten-thousandth the charge diameter of a proton.

The initial LIGO observatories were funded by the United States National Science Foundation (NSF). They were conceived, built, and are operated by Caltech and MIT. They collected data from 2002 to 2010, but no gravitational waves were detected during that period.

The Advanced LIGO Project to enhance the original LIGO detectors began in 2008, and continues to be supported by the NSF, with important contributions from the United Kingdom&#x27;s Science and Technology Facilities Council, the Max Planck Society of Germany, and the Australian Research Council. The improved detectors began operation in 2015. The detection of gravitational waves was reported in 2016 by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) and the Virgo Collaboration with the international participation of scientists from several universities and research institutions. Scientists involved in the project and the analysis of the data for gravitational-wave astronomy are organized by the LSC, which includes more than 1000 scientists worldwide, as well as 440,000 active Einstein@Home users .

LIGO is the largest and most ambitious project ever funded by the NSF. In 2017, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Rainer Weiss, Kip Thorne and Barry C. Barish &quot;for decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves&quot;.

Observations are made in &quot;runs&quot;. , LIGO has made three runs (with one of the runs divided into two &quot;subruns&quot;), and made 90 detections of gravitational waves. Maintenance and upgrades of the detectors are made between runs. The first run, O1, which ran from 12 September 2015 to 19 January 2016, made the first three detections, all black hole mergers. The second run, O2, which ran from 30 November 2016 to 25 August 2017, made eight detections: seven black hole mergers and the first neutron star merger. The third run, O3, began on 1 April 2019; it was divided into O3a, from 1 April to 30 September 2019, and O3b, from 1 November 2019 until it was suspended on 27 March 2020 due to COVID-19. The O3 run included the first detection of the merger of a neutron star with a black hole.

Subsequent gravitational wave observatories Virgo in Italy, and KAGRA in Japan, which both use interferometer arms 3 km long, are coordinating with LIGO to continue observations after the COVID-caused stop, and LIGO&#x27;s O4 observing run started on 24 May 2023. LIGO projects a sensitivity goal of 160–190 Mpc for binary neutron star mergers (sensitivities: Virgo 80–115 Mpc, KAGRA greater than 1 Mpc).

==History==
===Background===
The LIGO concept built upon early work by many scientists to test a component of Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity, the existence of gravitational waves. Starting in the 1960s, American scientists including Joseph Weber, as well as Soviet scientists Mikhail Gertsenshtein and Vladislav Pustovoit, conceived of basic ideas and prototypes of laser interferometry, and in 1967 Rainer Weiss of MIT published an analysis of interferometer use and initiated the construction of a prototype with military funding, but it was terminated before it could become operational. Starting in 1968, Kip Thorne initiated theoretical efforts on gravitational waves and their sources at Caltech, and was convinced that gravitational wave detection would eventually succeed.

Prototype interferometric gravitational wave detectors (interferometers) were built in the late 1960s by Robert L. Forward and colleagues at Hughes Research Laboratories (with mirrors mounted on a vibration isolated plate rather than free swinging), and in the 1970s (with free swinging mirrors between which light bounced many times) by Weiss at MIT, and then by Heinz Billing and colleagues in Garching Germany, and then by Ronald Drever, James Hough and colleagues in Glasgow, Scotland.

In 1980, the NSF funded the study of a large interferometer led by MIT (Paul Linsay, Peter Saulson, Rainer Weiss), and the following year, Caltech constructed a 40-meter prototype (Ronald Drever and Stan Whitcomb). The MIT study established the feasibility of interferometers at a 1-kilometer scale with adequate sensitivity.

Under pressure from the NSF, MIT and Caltech were asked to join forces to lead a LIGO project based on the MIT study and on experimental work at Caltech, MIT, Glasgow, and Garching. Drever, Thorne, and Weiss formed a LIGO steering committee, though they were turned down for funding in 1984 and 1985. By 1986, they were asked to disband the steering committee and a single director, Rochus E. Vogt (Caltech), was appointed. In 1988, a research and development proposal achieved funding.

From 1989 through 1994, LIGO failed to progress technically and organizationally. Only political efforts continued to acquire funding. Ongoing funding was routinely rejected until 1991, when the U.S. Congress agreed to fund LIGO for the first year for $23 million. However, requirements for receiving the funding were not met or approved, and the NSF questioned the technological and organizational basis of the project. By 1992, LIGO was restructured with Drever no longer a direct participant. Ongoing project management issues and technical concerns were revealed in NSF reviews of the project, resulting in the withholding of funds until they formally froze spending in 1993.

In 1994, after consultation between relevant NSF personnel, LIGO&#x27;s scientific leaders, and the presidents of MIT and Caltech, Vogt stepped down and Barry Barish (Caltech) was appointed laboratory director, and the NSF made clear that LIGO had one last chance for support. Barish&#x27;s team created a new study, budget, and project plan with a budget exceeding the previous proposals by 40%. Barish proposed to the NSF and National Science Board to build LIGO as an evolutionary detector, where detection of gravitational waves with initial LIGO would be possible, and with advanced LIGO would be probable. This new proposal received NSF funding, Barish was appointed Principal Investigator, and the increase was approved. In 1994, with a budget of US$395 million, LIGO stood as the largest overall funded NSF project in history. The project broke ground in Hanford, Washington in late 1994 and in Livingston, Louisiana in 1995. As construction neared completion in 1997, under Barish&#x27;s leadership two organizational institutions were formed, LIGO Laboratory and LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC). The LIGO laboratory consists of the facilities supported by the NSF under LIGO Operation and Advanced R&amp;D; this includes administration of the LIGO detector and test facilities. The LIGO Scientific Collaboration is a forum for organizing technical and scientific research in LIGO. It is a separate organization from LIGO Laboratory with its own oversight. Barish appointed Weiss as the first spokesperson for this scientific collaboration.

===Observations begin===
Initial LIGO operations between 2002 and 2010 did not detect any gravitational waves. In 2004, under Barish, the funding and groundwork were laid for the next phase of LIGO development (called &quot;Enhanced LIGO&quot;). This was followed by a multi-year shut-down while the detectors were replaced by much improved &quot;Advanced LIGO&quot; versions. Much of the research and development work for the LIGO/aLIGO machines was based on pioneering work for the GEO600 detector at Hannover, Germany. By February 2015, the detectors were brought into engineering mode in both locations.

In mid-September 2015, &quot;the world&#x27;s largest gravitational-wave facility&quot; completed a five-year US$200-million overhaul, bringing the total cost to $620 million. On 18 September 2015, Advanced LIGO began its first formal science observations at about four times the sensitivity of the initial LIGO interferometers. Its sensitivity was to be further enhanced until it was planned to reach design sensitivity 

====Detections====
On 11 February 2016, the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration published a paper about the detection of gravitational waves, from a signal detected at 09.51 UTC on 14 September 2015 of two ~30 solar mass black holes merging about 1.3 billion light-years from Earth.

Current executive director David Reitze announced the findings at a media event in Washington D.C., while executive director emeritus Barry Barish presented the first scientific paper of the findings at CERN to the physics community.

On 2 May 2016, members of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and other contributors were awarded a Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics for contributing to the direct detection of gravitational waves.

On 16 June 2016 LIGO announced a second signal was detected from the merging of two black holes with 14.2 and 7.5 times the mass of the Sun. The signal was picked up on 26 December 2015, at 3:38 UTC.

The detection of a third black hole merger, between objects of 31.2 and 19.4 solar masses, occurred on 4 January 2017 and was announced on 1 June 2017. Laura Cadonati was appointed the first deputy spokesperson.

A fourth detection of a black hole merger, between objects of 30.5 and 25.3 solar masses, was observed on 14 August 2017 and was announced on 27 September 2017.

In 2017, Weiss, Barish, and Thorne received the Nobel Prize in Physics &quot;for decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves.&quot; Weiss was awarded one-half of the total prize money, and Barish and Thorne each received a one-quarter prize.

After shutting down for improvements, LIGO resumed operation on 26 March 2019, with Virgo joining the network of gravitational-wave detectors on 1 April 2019. Both ran until 27 March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic halted operations. During the COVID shutdown, LIGO underwent a further upgrade in sensitivity, and observing run O4 with the new sensitivity began on 24 May 2023.

==Mission==
LIGO&#x27;s mission is to directly observe gravitational waves of cosmic origin. These waves were first predicted by Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity in 1916, when the technology necessary for their detection did not yet exist. Their existence was indirectly confirmed when observations of the binary pulsar PSR 1913+16 in 1974 showed an orbital decay which matched Einstein&#x27;s predictions of energy loss by gravitational radiation. The Nobel Prize in Physics 1993 was awarded to Hulse and Taylor for this discovery.

Direct detection of gravitational waves had long been sought. Their discovery has launched a new branch of astronomy to complement electromagnetic telescopes and neutrino observatories. Joseph Weber pioneered the effort to detect gravitational waves in the 1960s through his work on resonant mass bar detectors. Bar detectors continue to be used at six sites worldwide. By the 1970s, scientists including Rainer Weiss realized the applicability of laser interferometry to gravitational wave measurements. Robert Forward operated an interferometric detector at Hughes in the early 1970s.

In fact as early as the 1960s, and perhaps before that, there were papers published on wave resonance of light and gravitational waves. Work was published in 1971 on methods to exploit this resonance for the detection of high-frequency gravitational waves. In 1962, M. E. Gertsenshtein and V. I. Pustovoit published the very first paper describing the principles for using interferometers for the detection of very long wavelength gravitational waves. The authors argued that by using interferometers the sensitivity can be 107 to 1010 times better than by using electromechanical experiments. Later, in 1965, Braginsky extensively discussed gravitational-wave sources and their possible detection. He pointed out the 1962 paper and mentioned the possibility of detecting gravitational waves if the interferometric technology and measuring techniques improved.

Since the early 1990s, physicists have thought that technology has evolved to the point where detection of gravitational waves—of significant astrophysical interest—is now possible.

In August 2002, LIGO began its search for cosmic gravitational waves. Measurable emissions of gravitational waves are expected from binary systems (collisions and coalescences of neutron stars or black holes), supernova explosions of massive stars (which form neutron stars and black holes), accreting neutron stars, rotations of neutron stars with deformed crusts, and the remnants of gravitational radiation created by the birth of the universe. The observatory may, in theory, also observe more exotic hypothetical phenomena, such as gravitational waves caused by oscillating cosmic strings or colliding domain walls.

==Observatories==
LIGO operates two gravitational wave observatories in unison: the LIGO Livingston Observatory () in Livingston, Louisiana, and the LIGO Hanford Observatory, on the DOE Hanford Site (), located near Richland, Washington. These sites are separated by 3,002 kilometers (1,865 miles) straight line distance through the earth, but 3,030 kilometers (1,883 miles) over the surface. Since gravitational waves are expected to travel at the speed of light, this distance corresponds to a difference in gravitational wave arrival times of up to ten milliseconds. Through the use of trilateration, the difference in arrival times helps to determine the source of the wave, especially when a third similar instrument like Virgo, located at an even greater distance in Europe, is added.

Each observatory supports an L-shaped ultra high vacuum system, measuring four kilometers (2.5 miles) on each side. Up to five interferometers can be set up in each vacuum system.

The LIGO Livingston Observatory houses one laser interferometer in the primary configuration. This interferometer was successfully upgraded in 2004 with an active vibration isolation system based on hydraulic actuators providing a factor of 10 isolation in the 0.1–5 Hz band. Seismic vibration in this band is chiefly due to microseismic waves and anthropogenic sources (traffic, logging, etc.).

The LIGO Hanford Observatory houses one interferometer, almost identical to the one at the Livingston Observatory. During the Initial and Enhanced LIGO phases, a half-length interferometer operated in parallel with the main interferometer. For this 2 km interferometer, the Fabry–Pérot arm cavities had the same optical finesse, and, thus, half the storage time as the 4 km interferometers. With half the storage time, the theoretical strain sensitivity was as good as the full length interferometers above 200 Hz but only half as good at low frequencies. During the same era, Hanford retained its original passive seismic isolation system due to limited geologic activity in Southeastern Washington.

==Operation==

The parameters in this section refer to the Advanced LIGO experiment. The primary interferometer consists of two beam lines of 4 km length which form a power-recycled Michelson interferometer with Gires–Tournois etalon arms. A pre-stabilized 1064 nm emits a beam with a power of 20 W that passes through a power recycling mirror. The mirror fully transmits light incident from the laser and reflects light from the other side increasing the power of the light field between the mirror and the subsequent beam splitter to 700 W. From the beam splitter the light travels along two orthogonal arms. By the use of partially reflecting mirrors, Fabry–Pérot cavities are created in both arms that increase the effective path length of laser light in the arm from 4 km to approximately 1,200 km. The power of the light field in the cavity is 100 kW.

When a gravitational wave passes through the interferometer, the spacetime in the local area is altered. Depending on the source of the wave and its polarization, this results in an effective change in length of one or both of the cavities. The effective length change between the beams will cause the light currently in the cavity to become very slightly out of phase (antiphase) with the incoming light. The cavity will therefore periodically get very slightly out of coherence and the beams, which are tuned to destructively interfere at the detector, will have a very slight periodically varying detuning. This results in a measurable signal.

After an equivalent of approximately 280 trips down the 4 km length to the far mirrors and back again, the two separate beams leave the arms and recombine at the beam splitter. The beams returning from two arms are kept out of phase so that when the arms are both in coherence and interference (as when there is no gravitational wave passing through), their light waves subtract, and no light should arrive at the photodiode. When a gravitational wave passes through the interferometer, the distances along the arms of the interferometer are shortened and lengthened, causing the beams to become slightly less out of phase. This results in the beams coming in phase, creating a resonance, hence some light arrives at the photodiode and indicates a signal. Light that does not contain a signal is returned to the interferometer using a power recycling mirror, thus increasing the power of the light in the arms. 

In actual operation, noise sources can cause movement in the optics, producing similar effects to real gravitational wave signals; a great deal of the art and complexity in the instrument is in finding ways to reduce these spurious motions of the mirrors. Background noise and unknown errors (which happen daily) are in the order of 10−20, while gravitational wave signals are around 10−22. After noise reduction, a signal-to-noise ratio around 20 can be achieved, or higher when combined with other gravitational wave detectors around the world.

==Observations==
Based on current models of astronomical events, and the predictions of the general theory of relativity, gravitational waves that originate tens of millions of light years from Earth are expected to distort the mirror spacing by about , less than one-thousandth the charge diameter of a proton. Equivalently, this is a relative change in distance of approximately one part in . A typical event which might cause a detection event would be the late stage inspiral and merger of two 10-solar-mass black holes, not necessarily located in the Milky Way galaxy, which is expected to result in a very specific sequence of signals often summarized by the slogan &quot;chirp,&quot; &quot;burst,&quot; &quot;quasi-normal mode ringing,&quot; &quot;exponential decay.&quot;

In their fourth Science Run at the end of 2004, the LIGO detectors demonstrated sensitivities in measuring these displacements to within a factor of two of their design.

During LIGO&#x27;s fifth Science Run in November 2005, sensitivity reached the primary design specification of a detectable strain of one part in over a bandwidth. The baseline inspiral of two roughly solar-mass neutron stars is typically expected to be observable if it occurs within about , or the vicinity of the Local Group, averaged over all directions and polarizations. Also at this time, LIGO and GEO 600 (the German-UK interferometric detector) began a joint science run, during which they collected data for several months. Virgo (the French-Italian interferometric detector) joined in May 2007. The fifth science run ended in 2007, after extensive analysis of data from this run did not uncover any unambiguous detection events.

In February 2007, GRB 070201, a short gamma-ray burst arrived at Earth from the direction of the Andromeda Galaxy. The prevailing explanation of most short gamma-ray bursts is the merger of a neutron star with either a neutron star or a black hole. LIGO reported a non-detection for GRB 070201, ruling out a merger at the distance of Andromeda with high confidence. Such a constraint was predicated on LIGO eventually demonstrating a direct detection of gravitational waves.

===Enhanced LIGO===

After the completion of Science Run 5, initial LIGO was upgraded with certain technologies, planned for Advanced LIGO but available and able to be retrofitted to initial LIGO, which resulted in an improved-performance configuration dubbed Enhanced LIGO. Some of the improvements in Enhanced LIGO included:
* Increased laser power
* Homodyne detection
* Output mode cleaner
* In-vacuum readout hardware

Science Run 6 (S6) began in July 2009 with the enhanced configurations on the 4 km detectors. It concluded in October 2010, and the disassembly of the original detectors began.

===Advanced LIGO===
After 2010, LIGO went offline for several years for a major upgrade, installing the new Advanced LIGO detectors in the LIGO Observatory infrastructures.

The project continued to attract new members, with the Australian National University and University of Adelaide contributing to Advanced LIGO, and by the time the LIGO Laboratory started the first observing run &#x27;O1&#x27; with the Advanced LIGO detectors in September 2015, the LIGO Scientific Collaboration included more than 900 scientists worldwide.

The first observing run operated at a sensitivity roughly three times greater than Initial LIGO, and a much greater sensitivity for larger systems with their peak radiation at lower audio frequencies.

On 11 February 2016, the LIGO and Virgo collaborations announced the first observation of gravitational waves. The signal, named GW150914, was recorded on 14 September 2015, just two days after Advanced LIGO started collecting data following the upgrade. It matched the predictions of general relativity for the inward spiral and merger of a pair of black holes and subsequent ringdown of the resulting single black hole. The observations demonstrated the existence of binary stellar-mass black hole systems and the first observation of a binary black hole merger.

On 15 June 2016, LIGO announced the detection of a second gravitational wave event, recorded on 26 December 2015, at 3:38 UTC. Analysis of the observed signal indicated that the event was caused by the merger of two black holes with masses of 14.2 and 7.5 solar masses, at a distance of 1.4 billion light years. The signal was named GW151226.

The second observing run (O2) ran from 30 November 2016 to 25 August 2017, with Livingston achieving 15–25% sensitivity improvement over O1, and with Hanford&#x27;s sensitivity similar to O1. In this period, LIGO saw several further gravitational wave events: GW170104 in January; GW170608 in June; and five others between July and August 2017. Several of these were also detected by the Virgo Collaboration. Unlike the black hole mergers which are only detectable gravitationally, GW170817 came from the collision of two neutron stars and was also detected electromagnetically by gamma ray satellites and optical telescopes.

The third run (O3) began on 1 April 2019 and was planned to last until 30 April 2020; in fact it was suspended in March 2020 due to COVID-19. On 6 January 2020, LIGO announced the detection of what appeared to be gravitational ripples from a collision of two neutron stars, recorded on 25 April 2019, by the LIGO Livingston detector. Unlike GW170817, this event did not result in any light being detected. Furthermore, this is the first published event for a single-observatory detection, given that the LIGO Hanford detector was temporarily offline at the time and the event was too faint to be visible in Virgo&#x27;s data.

The fourth observing run (O4) was planned to start in December 2022, but was postponed until 24 May 2023. O4 is projected to continue until February 2025. As of O4, the interferometers are operating at a sensitivity of 155-175 Mpc, within the design sensitivity range of 160-190 Mpc for binary neutron star events. 

The fifth observing run (O5) is projected to begin in late 2025 or in 2026.

==Future==

===LIGO-India===

LIGO-India, or INDIGO, is a planned collaborative project between the LIGO Laboratory and the Indian Initiative in Gravitational-wave Observations (IndIGO) to create a gravitational-wave detector in India. The LIGO Laboratory, in collaboration with the US National Science Foundation and Advanced LIGO partners from the U.K., Germany and Australia, has offered to provide all of the designs and hardware for one of the three planned Advanced LIGO detectors to be installed, commissioned, and operated by an Indian team of scientists in a facility to be built in India.

The LIGO-India project is a collaboration between LIGO Laboratory and the LIGO-India consortium: Institute of Plasma Research, Gandhinagar; IUCAA (Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics), Pune and Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology, Indore.

The expansion of worldwide activities in gravitational-wave detection to produce an effective global network has been a goal of LIGO for many years. In 2010, a developmental roadmap issued by the Gravitational Wave International Committee (GWIC) recommended that an expansion of the global array of interferometric detectors be pursued as a highest priority. Such a network would afford astrophysicists with more robust search capabilities and higher scientific yields. The current agreement between the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo collaboration links three detectors of comparable sensitivity and forms the core of this international network. Studies indicate that the localization of sources by a network that includes a detector in India would provide significant improvements. Improvements in localization averages are predicted to be approximately an order of magnitude, with substantially larger improvements in certain regions of the sky.

The NSF was willing to permit this relocation, and its consequent schedule delays, as long as it did not increase the LIGO budget. Thus, all costs required to build a laboratory equivalent to the LIGO sites to house the detector would have to be borne by the host country. The first potential distant location was at AIGO in Western Australia, however the Australian government was unwilling to commit funding by 1 October 2011 deadline.

A location in India was discussed at a Joint Commission meeting between India and the US in June 2012. In parallel, the proposal was evaluated by LIGO&#x27;s funding agency, the NSF. As the basis of the LIGO-India project entails the transfer of one of LIGO&#x27;s detectors to India, the plan would affect work and scheduling on the Advanced LIGO upgrades already underway. In August 2012, the U.S. National Science Board approved the LIGO Laboratory&#x27;s request to modify the scope of Advanced LIGO by not installing the Hanford &quot;H2&quot; interferometer, and to prepare it instead for storage in anticipation of sending it to LIGO-India. In India, the project was presented to the Department of Atomic Energy and the Department of Science and Technology for approval and funding. On 17 February 2016, less than a week after LIGO&#x27;s landmark announcement about the detection of gravitational waves, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the Cabinet has granted &#x27;in-principle&#x27; approval to the LIGO-India mega science proposal.

A site near pilgrimage site of Aundha Nagnath in the Hingoli district of state Maharashtra in western India has been selected.

On 7 April 2023, the LIGO-India project was approved by the Cabinet of Government of India. Construction is to begin in Maharashtra&#x27;s Hingoli district at a cost of INR 2600 crores.

===A+===
Like Enhanced LIGO, certain improvements will be retrofitted to the existing Advanced LIGO instrument. These are referred to as proposals, and are planned for installation starting from 2019 until the upgraded detector is operational in 2024. The changes would almost double Advanced LIGO&#x27;s sensitivity, and increase the volume of space searched by a factor of seven. The upgrades include:
* Improvements to the mirror suspension system.
* Increased reflectivity of the mirrors.
* Using frequency-dependent squeezed light, which would simultaneously decrease radiation pressure at low frequencies and shot noise at high frequencies, and
* Improved mirror coatings with lower mechanical loss.

Because the final LIGO output photodetector is sensitive to phase, and not amplitude, it is possible to squeeze the signal so there is less phase noise and more amplitude noise, without violating the quantum mechanical limit on their product. This is done by injecting a &quot;squeezed vacuum state&quot; into the dark port (interferometer output) which is quieter, in the relevant parameter, than simple darkness. Such a squeezing upgrade was installed at both LIGO sites prior to the third observing run. The A+ improvement will see the installation of an additional optical cavity that acts to rotate the squeezing quadrature from phase-squeezed at high frequencies (above 50 Hz) to amplitude-squeezed at low frequencies, thereby also mitigating low-frequency radiation pressure noise.

===LIGO Voyager===
A third-generation detector at the existing LIGO sites is being planned under the name &quot;LIGO Voyager&quot; to improve the sensitivity by an additional factor of two, and halve the low-frequency cutoff to 10 Hz. Plans call for the glass mirrors and to be replaced by even larger 160 kg silicon test masses, cooled to 123 K (a temperature achievable with liquid nitrogen), and a change to a longer laser wavelength in the 1500–2200 nm range at which silicon is transparent. (Many documents assume a wavelength of 1550 nm, but this is not final.)

Voyager would be an upgrade to A+, to be operational around 2027–2028.

===Cosmic Explorer===
A design for a larger facility with longer arms is called &quot;Cosmic Explorer&quot;. This is based on the LIGO Voyager technology, has a similar LIGO-type L-shape geometry but with 40 km arms. The facility is currently planned to be on the surface. It has a higher sensitivity than Einstein Telescope for frequencies beyond 10 Hz, but lower sensitivity under 10 Hz.

<doc id="81611" wikidata="Q407635" url="?curid=81611" title="Coenzyme A">
<text>Coenzyme A (CoA, SHCoA, CoASH) is a coenzyme, notable for its role in the synthesis and oxidation of fatty acids, and the oxidation of pyruvate in the citric acid cycle. All genomes sequenced to date encode enzymes that use coenzyme A as a substrate, and around 4% of cellular enzymes use it (or a thioester) as a substrate. In humans, CoA biosynthesis requires cysteine, pantothenate (vitamin B5), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

In its acetyl form, coenzyme A is a highly versatile molecule, serving metabolic functions in both the anabolic and catabolic pathways. Acetyl-CoA is utilised in the post-translational regulation and allosteric regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase and carboxylase to maintain and support the partition of pyruvate synthesis and degradation.

==Discovery of structure==

Coenzyme A was identified by Fritz Lipmann in 1946, who also later gave it its name. Its structure was determined during the early 1950s at the Lister Institute, London, together by Lipmann and other workers at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital. Lipmann initially intended to study acetyl transfer in animals, and from these experiments he noticed a unique factor that was not present in enzyme extracts but was evident in all organs of the animals. He was able to isolate and purify the factor from pig liver and discovered that its function was related to a coenzyme that was active in choline acetylation. Work with Beverly Guirard, Nathan Kaplan, and others determined that pantothenic acid was a central component of coenzyme A. The coenzyme was named coenzyme A to stand for &quot;activation of acetate&quot;. In 1953, Fritz Lipmann won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine &quot;for his discovery of co-enzyme A and its importance for intermediary metabolism&quot;.

==Biosynthesis==
Coenzyme A is naturally synthesized from pantothenate (vitamin B5), which is found in food such as meat, vegetables, cereal grains, legumes, eggs, and milk. In humans and most living organisms, pantothenate is an essential vitamin that has a variety of functions. In some plants and bacteria, including &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, pantothenate can be synthesised &quot;de novo&quot; and is therefore not considered essential. These bacteria synthesize pantothenate from the amino acid aspartate and a metabolite in valine biosynthesis.

In all living organisms, coenzyme A is synthesized in a five-step process that requires four molecules of ATP, pantothenate and cysteine (see figure):

# Pantothenate (vitamin B5) is phosphorylated to 4′-phosphopantothenate by the enzyme pantothenate kinase (PanK; CoaA; CoaX). This is the committed step in CoA biosynthesis and requires ATP.
# A cysteine is added to 4′-phosphopantothenate by the enzyme phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase (PPCS; CoaB) to form 4&#x27;-phospho-N-pantothenoylcysteine (PPC). This step is coupled with ATP hydrolysis.
# PPC is decarboxylated to 4′-phosphopantetheine by phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase (PPC-DC; CoaC)
# 4′-phosphopantetheine is adenylated (or more properly, AMPylated) to form dephospho-CoA by the enzyme phosphopantetheine adenylyl transferase (COASY; PPAT; CoaD)
# Finally, dephospho-CoA is phosphorylated to coenzyme A by the enzyme dephosphocoenzyme A kinase (COASY, DPCK; CoaE). This final step requires ATP.
Enzyme nomenclature abbreviations in parentheses represent mammalian, other eukaryotic, and prokaryotic enzymes respectively. In mammals steps 4 and 5 are catalyzed by a bifunctional enzyme called COASY. This pathway is regulated by product inhibition. CoA is a competitive inhibitor for Pantothenate Kinase, which normally binds ATP. Coenzyme A, three ADP, one monophosphate, and one diphosphate are harvested from biosynthesis.

Coenzyme A can be synthesized through alternate routes when intracellular coenzyme A level are reduced and the &quot;de novo&quot; pathway is impaired. In these pathways, coenzyme A needs to be provided from an external source, such as food, in order to produce 4′-phosphopantetheine. Ectonucleotide pyrophosphates (ENPP) degrade coenzyme A to 4′-phosphopantetheine, a stable molecule in organisms. Acyl carrier proteins (ACP) (such as ACP synthase and ACP degradation) are also used to produce 4′-phosphopantetheine. This pathway allows for 4′-phosphopantetheine to be replenished in the cell and allows for the conversion to coenzyme A through enzymes, PPAT and PPCK.

A 2024 article detailed a plausible chemical synthesis mechanism for the pantetheine component (the main functional part) of coenzyme A in a primordial prebiotic world.
===Commercial production===
Coenzyme A is produced commercially via extraction from yeast, however this is an inefficient process (yields approximately 25 mg/kg) resulting in an expensive product. Various ways of producing CoA synthetically, or semi-synthetically have been investigated, although none are currently operating at an industrial scale.

== Function ==

=== Fatty acid synthesis ===

Since coenzyme A is, in chemical terms, a thiol, it can react with carboxylic acids to form thioesters, thus functioning as an acyl group carrier. It assists in transferring fatty acids from the cytoplasm to mitochondria. A molecule of coenzyme A carrying an acyl group is also referred to as &quot;acyl-CoA&quot;. When it is not attached to an acyl group, it is usually referred to as &#x27;CoASH&#x27; or &#x27;HSCoA&#x27;. This process facilitates the production of fatty acids in cells, which are essential in cell membrane structure.

Coenzyme A is also the source of the phosphopantetheine group that is added as a prosthetic group to proteins such as acyl carrier protein and formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase.

=== Energy production ===

Coenzyme A is one of five crucial coenzymes that are necessary in the reaction mechanism of the citric acid cycle. Its acetyl-coenzyme A form is the primary input in the citric acid cycle and is obtained from glycolysis, amino acid metabolism, and fatty acid beta oxidation. This process is the body&#x27;s primary catabolic pathway and is essential in breaking down the building blocks of the cell such as carbohydrates, amino acids, and lipids.

=== Regulation ===
When there is excess glucose, coenzyme A is used in the cytosol for synthesis of fatty acids. This process is implemented by regulation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which catalyzes the committed step in fatty acid synthesis. Insulin stimulates acetyl-CoA carboxylase, while epinephrine and glucagon inhibit its activity.

During cell starvation, coenzyme A is synthesized and transports fatty acids in the cytosol to the mitochondria. Here, acetyl-CoA is generated for oxidation and energy production. In the citric acid cycle, coenzyme A works as an allosteric regulator in the stimulation of the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase.

=== Antioxidant function and regulation ===
Discovery of the novel antioxidant function of coenzyme A highlights its protective role during cellular stress. Mammalian and bacterial cells subjected to oxidative and metabolic stress show significant increase in the covalent modification of protein cysteine residues by coenzyme A. This reversible modification is termed protein CoAlation (Protein-S-SCoA), which plays a similar role to protein &quot;S&quot;-glutathionylation by preventing the irreversible oxidation of the thiol group of cysteine residues.

Using anti-coenzyme A antibody and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methodologies, more than 2,000 CoAlated proteins were identified from stressed mammalian and bacterial cells. The majority of these proteins are involved in cellular metabolism and stress response. Different research studies have focused on deciphering the coenzyme A-mediated regulation of proteins. Upon protein CoAlation, inhibition of the catalytic activity of different proteins (e.g., metastasis suppressor NME1, peroxiredoxin 5, GAPDH, among others) is reported. To restore the protein&#x27;s activity, antioxidant enzymes that reduce the disulfide bond between coenzyme A and the protein cysteine residue play an important role. This process is termed protein deCoAlation. Thioredoxin A and Thioredoxin-like protein (YtpP), two bacterial proteins, are shown to deCoAlate proteins.

==Use in biological research==
Coenzyme A is available from various chemical suppliers as the free acid and lithium or sodium salts. The free acid of coenzyme A is detectably unstable, with around 5% degradation observed after 6 months when stored at −20 °C, and near complete degradation after 1 month at 37 °C. The lithium and sodium salts of CoA are more stable, with negligible degradation noted over several months at various temperatures. Aqueous solutions of coenzyme A are unstable above pH 8, with 31% of activity lost after 24 hours at 25 °C and pH 8. CoA stock solutions are relatively stable when frozen at pH 2–6. The major route of CoA activity loss is likely the air oxidation of CoA to CoA disulfides. CoA mixed disulfides, such as CoA-&quot;S&quot;–&quot;S&quot;-glutathione, are commonly noted contaminants in commercial preparations of CoA. Free CoA can be regenerated from CoA disulfide and mixed CoA disulfides with reducing agents such as dithiothreitol or 2-mercaptoethanol.

<doc id="81618" wikidata="Q260636" url="?curid=81618" title="List of counties in Georgia">
<text>The U.S. state of Georgia is divided into 159 counties, the second-highest number after Texas, which has 254 counties. Under the Georgia State Constitution, all of its counties are granted home rule to deal with problems that are purely local in nature. Also, eight consolidated city-counties have been established in Georgia: Athens–Clarke County, Augusta–Richmond County, Columbus–Muscogee County, Georgetown–Quitman County, Statenville–Echols County, Macon–Bibb County, Cusseta–Chattahoochee County, and Preston-Webster County.

==History==

From 1732 until 1758, the minor civil divisions in Georgia were districts and towns. In 1758, the Province of Georgia was divided into eight parishes, and another four parishes were created in 1765. On February 5, 1777, the original eight counties of the state were created: Burke, Camden, Chatham, Effingham, Glynn, Liberty, Richmond, and Wilkes.

Georgia has the second-largest number of counties of any state in the United States, only behind Texas, which has 254 counties. One traditional reasoning for the creation and location of so many counties in Georgia was that a country farmer, rancher, or lumberman should be able to travel to the legal county seat town or city, and then back home, in one day on horseback or via wagon. About 25 counties in Georgia were created in the first quarter of the 20th century, after the use of the railroad, automobile, truck, and bus had become possible. Because of the County Unit System, later declared unconstitutional, new counties, no matter the population, had at least one representative in the state house, keeping political power in rural areas. The last new county to be established in Georgia was Peach County, founded in 1924.

The proliferation of counties in Georgia led to multiple state constitutional amendments attempting to limit the number of counties. The most recent such amendment, ratified in 1945, limited the number to 159 counties, although there had been 161 counties from 1924 to 1931. In a rare consolidation of counties, both Campbell County and Milton County were annexed into Fulton County in 1932 as a financial move during the Great Depression, since those two county governments were nearly bankrupt. Fulton County contains Atlanta, and it was thought that tax revenues from Atlanta and its suburbs would help to support the rural areas of the discarded counties, which had very little tax income of their own—mostly from property taxes on farms and forests, which did not amount to much.

Due to Georgia&#x27;s high number of unpopulated counties, Georgia judges are able to get around a state constitutional provision prohibiting banishment &quot;beyond the limits of this state&quot; by banishing criminals from all but one county of the state, usually Echols County. Because the one county where the banished criminal is technically allowed to live is so unpopulated, the banished criminals will leave the state of Georgia rather than move to that county.

Georgia is the only state that still allows sole commissioner county government. As of 2021, seven of the state&#x27;s 159 counties operate under that system.

During the 2022 legislative session, the Georgia General Assembly began considering reducing the number of counties in the state. Despite the state increasing in population by over one million according to the 2020 Census, 67 counties lost population, mostly in rural areas. The rationale for consolidating counties is to reduce costs for county services such as school systems, law enforcement and elections.

==Changed names of counties==
A few counties in Georgia have changed their names. Jasper County was originally named &quot;Randolph County&quot;. Later, the present-day Randolph County was founded. Webster County was once named &quot;Kinchafoonee County&quot;, and Bartow County was originally named &quot;Cass County&quot;.

==Defunct counties==
*Christ Church, St. Andrew, St. David, St. George, St. James, St. John, St. Mary, St. Matthew, St. Patrick, St. Paul, St. Philip, and St. Thomas were all parishes that were dissolved in 1777 with the establishment of the charter counties.
*Bourbon County (1785–1788): formed out of disputed Yazoo lands in present-day Mississippi; dissolved in 1788.
*Campbell County (1828–1932): formed from Carroll and Coweta in 1828. Areas northwest of the Chattahoochee River became Douglas in 1870; the remainder of Campbell was merged into southwest Fulton in 1932.
* Milton County (1857–1932): formed from northeast Cobb, southeast Cherokee, and southwest Forsyth in 1857 (and later northern DeKalb); was merged into north Fulton in 1932.
* There was a previous Walton County in Georgia, which was actually located in what is now western North Carolina. A brief skirmish, the Walton War, was fought between North Carolina and Georgia in 1810, before Georgia relinquished its claim on that area after the 1811 survey of Ellicott Rock.

==Majority-minority counties==

Per the 2020 Census, 36 of Georgia&#x27;s 159 counties are majority-minority. Eighteen have African-American majorities and 18 are majority-minority with no dominant group. An influx of immigrants to the Atlanta metropolitan area and Latino workers to the Black Belt has helped to fuel the shift.

<doc id="81619" wikidata="Q86805" url="?curid=81619" title="Geryon">
<text>In Greek mythology, Geryon ( ; , genitive ), also Geryone (, or ), son of Chrysaor and Callirrhoe, the grandson of Medusa and the nephew of Pegasus, was a fearsome giant who dwelt on the island Erytheia of the mythic Hesperides in the far west of the Mediterranean. A more literal-minded later generation of Greeks associated the region with Tartessos in southern Iberia. Geryon was often described as a monster with either three bodies and three heads, or three heads and one body, or three bodies and one head. He is commonly accepted as being mostly humanoid, with some distinguishing features (such as wings, or multiple bodies etc.) and in mythology, famed for his cattle.

==Appearance==

According to Hesiod Geryon had one body and three heads, whereas the tradition followed by Aeschylus gave him three bodies. A lost description by Stesichoros said that he has six hands and six feet and is winged; there are some mid-6th century BC Chalcidian vases portraying Geryon as winged. Some accounts state that he had six legs as well while others state that the three bodies were joined to one pair of legs. Apart from these bizarre features, his appearance was that of a warrior. He owned a two-headed hound named Orthrus, which was the brother of Cerberus, and a herd of magnificent red cattle that were guarded by Orthrus, and a herder named Eurytion (son of Erytheia).

== Mythology ==

===The Tenth Labour of Heracles===

In the fullest account in the &quot;Bibliotheke&quot; of Pseudo-Apollodorus, Heracles was required to travel to Erytheia, in order to obtain the Cattle of Geryon (Γηρυόνου βόες) as his tenth labour. On the way there, he crossed the Libyan desert and became so frustrated at the heat that he shot an arrow at Helios, the Sun. Helios &quot;in admiration of his courage&quot; gave Heracles the golden cup he used to sail across the sea from the west to the east each night. Heracles used it to reach Erytheia, a favorite motif of the vase-painters. Such a magical conveyance undercuts any literal geography for Erytheia, the &quot;red island&quot; of the sunset.

When Heracles reached Erytheia, no sooner had he landed than he was confronted by the two-headed dog, Orthrus. With one huge blow from his olive-wood club, Heracles killed the watchdog. Eurytion, the herdsman, came to assist Orthrus, but Heracles dealt with him the same way.
On hearing the commotion, Geryon sprang into action, carrying three shields, three spears, and wearing three helmets. He pursued Heracles at the River Anthemus but fell victim to an arrow that had been dipped in the venomous blood of the Lernaean Hydra, shot so forcefully by Heracles that it pierced Geryon&#x27;s forehead, &quot;and Geryon bent his neck over to one side, like a poppy that spoils its delicate shapes, shedding its petals all at once&quot;. 

Heracles then had to herd the cattle back to Eurystheus. In Roman versions of the narrative, on the Aventine Hill in Italy, Cacus stole some of the cattle as Heracles slept, making the cattle walk backwards so that they left no trail, a repetition of the trick of the young Hermes. According to some versions, Heracles drove his remaining cattle past a cave, where Cacus had hidden the stolen animals, and they began calling out to each other. In others, Caca, Cacus&#x27; sister, told Heracles where he was. Heracles then killed Cacus, and according to the Romans, founded an altar where the Forum Boarium, the cattle market, was later held.

To annoy Heracles, Hera sent a gadfly to bite the cattle, irritate them and scatter them. The hero was within a year able to retrieve them. Hera then sent a flood which raised the level of a river so much, Heracles could not cross with the cattle. He piled stones into the river to make the water shallower. When he finally reached the court of Eurystheus, the cattle were sacrificed to Hera.

In the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Vergil may have based the triple-souled figure of Erulus, king of Praeneste, on Geryon and Hercules&#x27; conquest of Geryon is mentioned in Book VIII. The Herculean Sarcophagus of Genzano features a three-headed representation of Geryon.

===Stesichorus&#x27; account===
The poet Stesichorus wrote a poem &quot;Geryoneis&quot; (Γηρυονηΐς) in the sixth century BC, which was apparently the source of this section in &quot;Bibliotheke&quot;; it contains the first reference to Tartessus. From the fragmentary papyri found at Oxyrhyncus it is possible (although there is no evidence) that Stesichorus inserted a character, Menoites, who reported the theft of the cattle to Geryon. Geryon then had an interview with his mother Callirrhoe, who begged him not to confront Heracles. They appear to have expressed some doubt as to whether Geryon would prove to be immortal. The gods met in council, where Athena warned Poseidon that she would protect Heracles against Poseidon&#x27;s grandson Geryon. Denys Page observes that the increase in representation of the Geryon episode in vase-paintings increased from the mid-sixth century and suggests that Stesichorus&#x27; &quot;Geryoneis&quot; provided the impetus.

The fragments are sufficient to show that the poem was composed in twenty-six line triads, of strophe, antistrophe and epode, repeated in columns along the original scroll, facts that aided Page in placing many of the fragments, sometimes of no more than a word, in what he believed to be their proper positions.

===Pausanias&#x27; account===
In his work &quot;Description of Greece&quot;, Pausanias mentions that Geryon had a daughter, Erytheia, who had a son with Hermes, Norax, the founder of the city of Nora in Sardinia.

==In Dante&#x27;s Inferno==
The Geryon of Dante&#x27;s 14th century epic poem &quot;Inferno&quot; bears no resemblance to any previous writings. Here, Geryon has become the Monster of Fraud, a beast with the paws of a bear or lion, the body of a wyvern, and a scorpion&#x27;s poisonous sting at the tip of his tail, but with the face of an &quot;honest man&quot; (similar to a manticore). He dwells somewhere in the shadowed depths below the cliff between the seventh and eighth circles of Hell (the circles of violence and simple fraud, respectively); Geryon rises from the pit at Virgil&#x27;s call and to Dante&#x27;s horror Virgil requests a ride on the creature&#x27;s back. They then board him, and Geryon slowly glides in descending circles around the waterfall of the river Phlegethon down to the great depths to the Circle of Fraud.

==In medieval Iberian culture==

The myth of Geryon is linked to the building of the nations of Spain and Portugal, since he was considered an inhabitant of the Iberian Peninsula.

Medieval authors such as the bishop of Girona Joan Margarit i Pau (1422–1484) or the bishop of Toledo Rodrigo Ximénez de Rada tried to legitimate the resistance of Geryon against the Greek invader.

The of Alfonso X of Castile tells how Hercules killed the giant Geryon, cut his head off and ordered a tower built on it marking his victory. The Tower of Hercules in Coruña, Spain, is actually a working lighthouse rebuilt on a Roman lighthouse.

The Portuguese friar Bernardo de Brito considers the monster a historical invader, ruling despotically over the descendants of Tubal.

<text>In Greek mythology, Orthrus (, &quot;Orthros&quot;) or Orthus (, &quot;Orthos&quot;) was, according to the mythographer Apollodorus, a two-headed dog who guarded Geryon&#x27;s cattle and was killed by Heracles. He was the offspring of the monsters Echidna and Typhon, and the brother of Cerberus, who was also a multi-headed guard dog.

==Name==
His name is given as either &quot;Orthrus&quot; (&quot;Ὄρθρος&quot;) or &quot;Orthus&quot; (&quot;Ὄρθος&quot;). For example, Hesiod, the oldest source, calls the hound &quot;Orthus&quot;, while Apollodorus calls him &quot;Orthrus&quot;.

==Mythology==
According to Hesiod, Orthrus was the father of the Sphinx and the Nemean Lion, though whom Hesiod meant as the mother, whether it is Orthrus&#x27; own mother Echidna, the Chimera, or Ceto, is unclear.

Orthrus and his master Eurytion were charged with guarding the three-headed, or three-bodied giant Geryon&#x27;s herd of red cattle in the &quot;sunset&quot; land of Erytheia (&quot;red one&quot;), an island in the far west of the Mediterranean. Heracles killed Orthrus, and later slew Eurytion and Geryon before taking the red cattle to complete his tenth labor. According to Apollodorus, Heracles killed Orthrus with his club, although in art Orthrus is sometimes depicted pierced by arrows.

The poet Pindar refers to the &quot;hounds of Geryon&quot; trembling before Heracles. Pindar&#x27;s use of the plural &quot;hounds&quot; in connection with Geryon is unique. He may have used the plural because Orthus had multiple heads, or perhaps because he knew a tradition in which Geryon had more than one dog.

==In art==
Depictions of Orthrus in art are rare, and always in connection with the theft of Geryon&#x27;s cattle by Heracles. He is usually shown dead or dying, sometimes pierced by one or more arrows.

The earliest depiction of Orthrus is found on a late seventh-century bronze horse pectoral from Samos (Samos B2518). It shows a two-headed Orthrus, with an arrow protruding from one of his heads, crouching at the feet, and in front of Geryon. Orthrus is facing Heracles, who stands to the left, wearing his characteristic lion-skin, fighting Geryon to the right.

A red-figure cup by Euphronios from Vulci c. 550–500 BC (Munich 2620) shows a two-headed Orthrus lying belly-up, with an arrow piercing his chest, and his snake tail still writhing behind him. Heracles is on the left, wearing his lion-skin, fighting a three-bodied Geryon to the right. An Attic black-figure neck amphora, by the Swing Painter c. 550–500 BC (Cab. Med. 223), shows a two-headed Orthrus, at the feet of a three-bodied Geryon, with two arrows protruding through one of his heads, and a dog tail.

According to Apollodorus, Orthrus had two heads; however, in art, the number varies. As in the Samos pectoral, Euphronios&#x27; cup, and the Swing Painter&#x27;s, amphora, Orthrus is usually depicted with two heads, although, from the mid sixth century, he is sometimes depicted with only one head, while one early fifth century BC Cypriot stone relief gives him three heads, á la Cerberus.

The Euphronios cup, and the stone relief depict Orthrus, like Cerberus, with a snake tail, though usually he is shown with a dog tail, as in the Swing Painter&#x27;s amphora.

==Similarities with Cerberus==
Orthrus bears a close resemblance to Cerberus, the hound of Hades. The classical scholar Arthur Bernard Cook called Orthrus Cerberus&#x27; &quot;doublet&quot;. According to Hesiod, Cerberus, like Orthrus was the offspring of Echidna and Typhon. And like Orthrus, Cerberus was multi-headed. The earliest accounts gave Cerberus fifty, or even one hundred heads, though in literature three heads for Cerberus became the standard. However, in art, often only two heads for Cerberus are shown. Cerberus was also usually depicted with a snake tail, just as Orthrus was sometimes. Both became guard dogs, with Cerberus guarding the gates of Hades, and both were overcome by Heracles in one of his labours.
