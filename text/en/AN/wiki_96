<text>Tomaž (Tomo) Pisanski (born 24 May 1949 in Ljubljana, Yugoslavia, which is now in Slovenia) is a Slovenian mathematician working mainly in discrete mathematics and graph theory. He is considered by many Slovenian mathematicians to be the &quot;father of Slovenian discrete mathematics.&quot;

==Biography==
As a high school student, Pisanski competed in the 1966 and 1967 International Mathematical Olympiads as a member of the Yugoslav team, winning a bronze medal in 1967. He studied at the University of Ljubljana where he obtained a B.Sc, M.Sc and PhD in mathematics. His 1981 PhD thesis in topological graph theory was written under the guidance of Torrence Parsons. He also obtained an M.Sc. in computer science from Pennsylvania State University in 1979.

Currently, Pisanski is a professor of discrete and computational mathematics and Head of the Department of Information Sciences and Technology at University of Primorska in Koper. In addition, he is a professor at the University of Ljubljana Faculty of Mathematics and Physics (FMF). He has been a member of the Institute of Mathematics, Physics and Mechanics (IMFM) in Ljubljana since 1980, and the leader of several IMFM research projects. In 1991 he established the Department of Theoretical Computer Science at IMFM, of which he has served as both head and deputy head.

He has taught undergraduate and graduate courses in mathematics and computer science at the University of Ljubljana, University of Zagreb, University of Udine, University of Leoben, California State University, Chico, Simon Fraser University, University of Auckland and Colgate University. Pisanski has been an adviser for M.Sc and PhD students in both mathematics and computer science. Notable students include John Shawe-Taylor (B.Sc in Ljubljana), Vladimir Batagelj, Bojan Mohar, Sandi Klavžar, and Sandra Sattolo (M.Sc in Udine).

== Research ==
Pisanski’s research interests span several areas of discrete and computational mathematics, including combinatorial configurations, abstract polytopes, maps on surfaces, chemical graph theory, and the history of mathematics and science. In 1980 he calculated the genus of the Cartesian product of any pair of connected, bipartite, &quot;d&quot;-valent graphs using a method that was later called the &quot;White–Pisanski method&quot;. In 1982 Vladimir Batagelj and Pisanski proved that the Cartesian product of a tree and a cycle is Hamiltonian if and only if no degree of the tree exceeds the length of the cycle. They also proposed a conjecture concerning &quot;cyclic Hamiltonicity&quot; of graphs. Their conjecture was proved in 2005. With Brigitte Servatius he is the co-author of the book &quot;Configurations from a Graphical Viewpoint&quot; (2013).

<doc id="84541" wikidata="Q222930" url="?curid=84541" title="Antiochus II Theos">
<text>Antiochus II Theos (, , meaning &quot;Antiochus the God&quot;; 286 – July 246 BC) was a Greek king of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire who reigned from 261 to 246 BC. He succeeded his father Antiochus I Soter in the winter of 262–61 BC. He was the younger son of Antiochus I and princess Stratonice, the daughter of Demetrius Poliorcetes.

Antiochus II was a forceful personality who in his lifetime largely succeeded to hold the sprawling Seleucid realm intact. However his fateful decision to repudiate his first wife Laodice and marry a Ptolemaic princess Berenice as part of a peace treaty led to a succession struggle after his death that would shake the empire&#x27;s foundations and cause large territorial losses.

==Early life==
Antiochus II was the younger son of Antiochus I Soter and his famous queen Stratonice. Antiochus was initially not expected to inherit the throne, but in 267 BC his father had his elder brother Seleucus executed on charges of rebellion.

==Reign==
He inherited lasting tensions with Ptolemaic Egypt and soon initiated the Second Syrian War in alliance with Antigonus II of the Antigonid dynasty. The war was largely fought along the coasts of Asia Minor and conflated with the constant intrigues of petty despots and restless city-states in Asia Minor. Antiochus II made some gains in Asia Minor and acquired direct access to Aegean Sea by capturing Miletus and Ephesus. During the war he assumed the title &quot;Theos&quot; (Greek: , &quot;God&quot;), being such to the Milesians in slaying the tyrant Timarchus. At around the same time Antiochus II also made some attempt to get a footing in Thrace which details are largely unknown and a mint in the city of Byzantium briefly issued coins in his name.

In the end the war did little to alter the general balance of power in the Eastern Mediterranean. Coele-Syria in particular, the main disputed territory between the Seleucid empire and the Ptolemaic Kingdom, remained firmly in the hands of the Ptolemies. In 257 BC, the Ptolemaic pharaoh Ptolemy II Philadelphus even invaded the Seleucid-held part of Syria, though the outcome of this invasion is unknown. In 253 BC, with his Antigonid allies knocked out of the war by rebellions, Antiochus II made peace with Ptolemy II. As part of the settlement, Antiochus II divorced Laodice and married Ptolemy II&#x27;s daughter Berenice, with the understanding that any children born from their union would inherit the Seleucid throne. Laodice was well provided for in the divorce arrangement. Antiochus II gave her various land grants throughout Anatolia which are known through inscriptions; such as large estates in the Hellespont, other properties near Cyzicus, Ilion and in Caria. She was also granted revenues from various territories and tax exemptions. According to a royal record at Sardis, her land titles were to be treated as in royal possession.

Laodice remained a very powerful and political influential figure and continued numerous intrigues to become queen again. By 246 BC, possibly at the news of Ptolemy II&#x27;s death, Antiochus II had left Berenice and their infant son Antiochus in Antioch to live again with Laodice in Asia Minor. Antiochus II soon suddenly died and Laodice was widely accused of having him poisoned. Antiochus was buried in the Belevi Mausoleum.

A succession struggle erupted almost immediately. Berenice initially had the advantage by holding Antioch but her son Antiochus was but an infant. Meanwhile, Laodice proclaimed her eldest son Seleucus as king Seleucus II and moved in from Asia Minor, claiming that on his deathbed Antiochus II reversed his earlier decision and named Seleucus as his successor. The then-reigning brother of Berenice Ptolemy III marched from Egypt to support his sister, only to find her and her son murdered by partisans of Laodice. Enraged Ptolemy continued the war, dubbed the Third Syrian War which proved to be a disaster for the Seleucid empire.

==Eastern affairs==
Very little is known about any Antiochus II&#x27;s activities in regards to the eastern Upper Satrapies such as Media, Parthia, Bactria or Persis. Chiefly preoccupied with conflicts in the Eastern Mediterranean and with family issues, Antiochus II seems to resorted to appointing independent-minded men such like Diodotus and Andragoras as satraps in the area. These two appointments eventually resulted in the creation of the independent Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and the Parthian Empire respectively. There is also a marked decline in quantity of Antiochus II&#x27;s coinage in Bactria when compared to that of his father, which had been interpreted variously in scholarship. It has been claimed that ambitious satraps may have taken advantage of Antiochus II&#x27;s absenteeism to gradually weaken their ties with the central government even in Antiochus II&#x27;s lifetime without outwardly proclaiming independence. However, posthumous coinage of a popular king was a relatively common practice in the Hellenistic Age and Antiochus II may have minted coins in the name of his half-Sogdian father in order to legitimize both himself and his dynasty.

==Possible relations with India==
An uncertain Antiochus is mentioned in the Edicts of Ashoka, as one of the recipients of the Indian Emperor Ashoka&#x27;s Buddhist proselytism. A majority opinion however holds that the Greek king mentioned there is in fact be Antiochus II&#x27;s father, Antiochus I Soter, who arguably had more proximity with the East.

<text>Seleucus II Callinicus Pogon (; &quot;Callinicus&quot; meaning &quot;beautifully triumphant&quot;, &quot;Pogon&quot; meaning &quot;the Beard&quot;; July/August 265 BC – December 225 BC), was a ruler of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire, who reigned from 246 BC to 225 BC. Faced with multiple enemies on various fronts, and not always successful militarily, his reign was a time of great turmoil and fragmentation for the Seleucid Empire, before its eventual restoration under his second son and eventual successor, Antiochus III.

==Accession and invasion==

After the death of his father, Antiochus II in July 246 BC, Seleucus was proclaimed king by his mother, Laodice in Ephesos, while his father&#x27;s second wife, Queen Berenice, declared her son Antiochus king in Antioch. Berenice acted decisively at first, seizing control of most of Syria and Cilicia. However, before her brother Ptolemy III, the king of Egypt, was able to land and support her son&#x27;s claims, she was murdered by partisans of Seleucus II and Queen Laodice.

This dynastic feud began the Third Syrian War. Ptolemy III invaded the Seleucid Empire and landing at Seleucia Pieria, accepted the surrender of Syria and Cilicia and marched victoriously to the Tigris or beyond (although he did not reach as far as Babylon). Ptolemy remained in Syria during the winter of 246-245 BC, while Seleucus sent an expedition by sea to retake the area, only to have it wrecked by storms; not the last time he was to be defeated by bad luck.

==Defeat in the Third Syrian war and Anatolia==

Seleucus managed to maintain himself in the interior of Asia Minor and made arrangements to shore up his power there. One of his sisters married Mithridates II of Pontus, another married Ariarathes III of Cappadocia and he married his aunt Laodice II, by whom he had five children including Antiochis, Seleucus III Ceraunus and Antiochus III the Great. Seleucus then appointed his brother Antiochus Hierax as viceroy in Asia Minor and marched against the Ptolemies.

Ptolemy III returned to Egypt in 245 BC, reputedly taking with him 40,000 talents of gold and the statues of Egyptian gods which had been looted centuries before by the Persians. Seleucus crossed into Babylonia and Mesopotamia first, receiving the loyalty of the empire&#x27;s Eastern regions and then marched into Syria where he recovered Antioch by 244 BC. This was followed by the recapture of the other major cities in the area. By 242 BC, the interior of Northern Syria had been regained and Seleucus was even able to launch raids into Ptolemaic controlled Syria around Damascus.

Elsewhere, the Seleucids were less successful. In the Aegean, the Ptolemaic armies were able to seize control of Ephesus, as well as Ainos and Maroneia in Thrace, and several cities on the Asian side of the Hellespont.

In 241 BC, peace was finally agreed and a treaty signed. Ptolemy recognised Seleucus as king and the Eleutheros river was once again accepted as the boundary between the two empires in Syria. Ptolemy did however retain his conquests in Thrace, Ephesus and, most importantly of all, the vital port of Seleucia Pieria. This city contained the tomb of the Seleucid dynasty&#x27;s founder, Seleucus I, and controlled much of the trade from Antioch. The Seleucid desire to recover the city would prove to be one of the main causes of the outbreak of the Fourth Syrian war in 219 BC.

In the meantime, Antiochus Hierax, had set himself up as a rival in Asia Minor against Seleucus, supported by their domineering mother Laodice. Seleucus appears to have launched an attack against Antiochus Hierax, but was unable to take Sardis. After two years of stalemate, the brothers met at the Battle of Ancyra around 237 BC. With the support of Mithridates II of Pontus and the Galatians Antiochus Hierax was victorious and Seleucus was barely able to escape with his life. After this Seleucus left the country beyond the Taurus to his brother and the other powers of Anatolia and an uneasy peace between the two prevailed.
==Fragmentation in the East==

Seleucus then turned to the problems which had developed in the Eastern provinces of the empire over the last few decades and undertook an expedition to regain Parthia, the results of which came to nothing.

The Parthian satrap Andragoras had taken the opportunity to establish de facto independence and had begun minting his own coins in 245 BC. However, before Seleucus was able to turn his attention eastwards, by 238 BC, Andragoras had been killed by Arsaces I, a chieftain of the nomadic Parni, based in the city of Nissa (modern day Nisa, Turkmenistan). Arsaces had previously attacked Bactria and been driven off by the satrap Diodotus I. Diodotus had also used the opportunity of Seleucid distraction in the West to gain de facto independence and set himself up as an independent ruler.

After the defeat at Ancyra, the Seleucid garrisons of the region were further weakened and this allowed the Parthians under Arsaces the opportunity to seize more territory, including the city of Hekatompylos, which became their new capital around 237 BC. Around this time Diodotus was succeeded by his son Diodotus II who agreed to an alliance with Parthia, which now acted as a useful barrier to any Seleucid invasion to recover the East.

It was after this that Seleucus attempted to recover Parthia, but the sources indicate he was defeated, or perhaps withdrew in the face of Parthian strength. The recovery of the Seleucid position in the East would have to wait until the reign of his son Antiochus III. Following this defeat Diodotus II declared himself king of Bactria, officially severing any remaining links with the Seleucid court in 235 BC.

==The death of Antiochus Hierax==

Meanwhile, in Asia Minor, Pergamon now rose to greatness under Attalus I. Attalus&#x27; ambition to replace Antiochus Hierax as king of Asia Minor led to a major war and several battles during the 230s BC. In short order, Attalus defeated the Galatians, Antiochus Hierax and finally an attempt by Seleucus II to reclaim his control of Asia Minor. After being defeated by Attalus in four battles, Antiochus Hierax fled to Armenia, whose king gave him refuge. Antiochus Hierax then attempted to invade Mesopotamia. Andromachos, his mother&#x27;s brother, commanded the Seleucid forces on this occasion and defeated him. Fleeing again, Antiochus finally perished in Thrace, where he was killed by robbers in c. 226 BC.

Seleucus by this time had his hands full dealing with rebellion in Antioch instigated by his aunt, Queen Stratonice, who had previously been married to King Demetrius II of Macedon. Upon returning to Syria after Demetrius II took another wife, Stratonice of Macedon proposed that she marry her nephew, or possibly demanded he avenge the insult to her honour by attacking Demetrius. In either case, Seleucus refused her suggestions and, infuriated, she raised Antioch in rebellion. Seleucus had to besiege the city, which he eventually recaptured. Stratonice fled to Seleucia, hoping to take refuge with Ptolemy III, but was captured en route and executed.

In the years after the defeat at Ancyra (237 BC), Seleucus focused on rebuilding his domains, expanding Antioch and suppressing rebellions in Babylon. By 227 BC, he had stabilised the situation enough to begin contemplating a new offensive against Attalus to retake Asia Minor.

==Death and succession==

Before he could launch this invasion, Seleucus died unexpectedly in 225 BC as the result of a fall from his horse. He was succeeded firstly by his eldest son Alexander who took the name Seleucus III and later by a younger son Antiochus III the Great in 222 BC.

<text>Mnestheus () is a character from Roman mythology, found in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;. He is described by Virgil as the ancestral hero of the Memmii and &quot;Of the house of Assaracus&quot;. One of a handful of vaguely defined lieutenants under Aeneas, he appears to be Aeneas&#x27;s most senior captain, taking charge in Book 9 in his absence. He takes second place in the boat race during the funeral games of Anchises in Book 5.

<doc id="84548" wikidata="Q1089095" url="?curid=84548" title="Cranford, New Jersey">
<text>Cranford is a township in Union County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, located southwest of Manhattan. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 23,847, an increase of 1,222 (+5.4%) from the 2010 census count of 22,625, which in turn reflected an increase of 47 (+0.2%) from the 22,578 counted in the 2000 census.

NJ Transit rail service is available at the Cranford station, along the Raritan Valley Line, with service to Newark Penn Station and to New York Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan via Midtown Direct. It is part of the New York metropolitan area.

Cranford was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 14, 1871, from portions of the Townships of Clark, Linden, Springfield Township, Union Township and Westfield. Portions of the township were taken to form Garwood (in 1903) and Kenilworth (in 1907). The township&#x27;s name is said to derive from the Crane family, including John Crane, who built a mill in 1720 along the Rahway River.

== Historic preservation ==

Historic sites in the township are overseen by the Cranford Historic Preservation Advisory Board.

The Cranford Historical Society, a private entity founded in 1927 and located in Hanson Park on Springfield Avenue, maintains the Crane-Phillips House (), located at 124 North Union Avenue, as a museum.

=== Historic figures ===
Though no known Cranford residents died in the American Civil War, at least 22 were active in the Union Army at the time of General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s surrender. Cranford&#x27;s last surviving Civil War veteran died in 1935.

James E. Warner is a former sheriff of Union County who was the namesake of the James E. Warner Plaza at the Cranford Train Station. Concerned by the then-growing pollution of the Rahway given the cleaner waters of his youth, Warner advocated for the preservation of the Rahway River and Rahway River Parkway parkland. One of Sheriff Warner&#x27;s successful targets in fighting Rahway River pollution was his battle against the discharge of paper makers; one such site is now the regional theater known as the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn. The Cranford Canoe Club, built in 1908, continues to offer canoes and kayaks for rent on the river in town.

Charles Hansel was co-founder of the Union County Parks Commission that preserved parkland all along the Rahway River and its tributaries in the 1920s, a greenway now known as the Rahway River Parkway. He was an engineer for the Pennsylvania Railroad and Central Railroad of New Jersey. Hansel lived in the 300 block of North Union Avenue in a home that still stands today, later moving to what is now Gray&#x27;s Funeral Home, near what is now called Hansel&#x27;s Dam by Sperry Park. For his Rahway River preservation efforts, a memorial copper plaque was placed to Hansel in Echo Lake Park.
Joshua Bryant was Cranford&#x27;s first Black law enforcement officer and the township&#x27;s first Black elected official.

William P. Westervelt was credited with thwarting the Baltimore Plot, an unsuccessful assassination attempt against president-elect Abraham Lincoln. He did so by cutting telegraph wires that would have alerted assassins to Lincoln&#x27;s arrival.

== Geography ==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of , including of land and of water (0.78%).

There are nine municipalities bordering the township: Garwood and Westfield to the west, Springfield Township to the north, Kenilworth to the northeast, Roselle and Roselle Park to the east, Linden to the southeast, Winfield Township and Clark to the south.

== Parks ==
=== Township parks ===
Parks run by the township and overseen by the Cranford Recreation and Parks Department include:

* Adams Park – Adams Avenue and Lambert Street. Morses Creek dips into Cranford behind this park.
* Buchanan Park – Centennial Avenue and Buchanan Avenue
* Cranford Canoe Club – Springfield Avenue and Orange Avenue The Cranford Canoe Club rents canoes and kayaks for trips on the Rahway River in Cranford. The current structure was built as a private canoe club in 1908.
* Community Center – Walnut Avenue. The Cranford Community Center, adjacent to the Cranford Public Library, offers classes, sports, speaker series and other recreational activities.
* Josiah Crane Park – Springfield Avenue and North Union Avenue. In 1971, the Cranford Historical Society marked the farm and village home of Josiah Crane Sr. (1791–1873) in a park across from the First Presbyterian Church on the Rahway River. This park now features Cranford&#x27;s 9/11 Memorial.
* Cranford West – Hope, N.J. Originally the home of the Cranford Boys Club on Silver Lake from the 1920s to the 1960s
* Girl Scout Park – Springfield Avenue and Orange Avenue. This was once the site of a canoe club, later the Neva Sykes Girl Scout House, demolished in the 1950s.
* Hampton Park – Eastman Street and Hampton Street
* Hanson Park – Springfield Avenue and Holly Street. Home of the Hanson Park Conservancy.
* Johnson Park – Johnson Avenue. The Johnson Avenue playground opened in July 1957.
* Lincoln Park – Lincoln Avenue at South Union. What is now Lincoln Park was the Cranford Golf Club in 1899, now moved to Westfield and called the Echo Lake Country Club. The Lincoln Avenue grounds were designed by Willie Dunn. Lincoln Park was also originally a former estate said to have supplied lumber to build the USS &quot;Constitution&quot; (&quot;Old Ironsides&quot;) in the 1700s. The grounds, at the corner of the Old York Road and Benjamin Street, also included the largest sour gum ever recorded in the Northeastern states, known as the Cranford Pepperidge Tree or &quot;Old Peppy&quot;. The cultivated shoots from Old Peppy&#x27;s root system now form a grove of saplings offering shade to the Deborah Cannon Partridge Wolfe Reading Garden in the park. The park has hosted bocce ball tournaments since the mid-1960s.
* Mayor&#x27;s Park – Springfield Avenue and North Union Avenue
* Memorial Park – Springfield Avenue and Central Avenue, in 2014, the Cranford Historical Society dedicated a civil war monument.
* Roosevelt Park – Orange Avenue and Pacific Avenue
* Sherman Park – Lincoln Avenue East. Former site of Sherman School and located on the Old York Road.

* At the corner of Elizabeth and North Union Avenues sits a memorial bench dedicated to the Cranford Dixie Giants, the town&#x27;s semiprofessional baseball team organized by and composed entirely of African-American players, which played in the early 1900s.

=== County parks ===
Parks run by the county inside Cranford&#x27;s borders (overseen by the Union County, New Jersey Parks and Recreation Department) include:

* Lenape Park in Cranford, Kenilworth, Springfield, Union and Westfield. Two tusks from an ancient American mastodon were found in 1936 north of Kenilworth Boulevard in what is now Lenape Park (other sources name the swampy area directly behind what is now the parking lot of Union College&#x27;s main building).
* MacConnell Park (formerly known as Liberty Park and frequently misspelled as &quot;McConnell Park&quot;) is named after the township&#x27;s first physician, Joseph Kerr MacConnell. It is located on Eastman Street and was known as the Peninsula during the Victorian era due to its position nearly encircled by the Rahway River.
* Nomahegan Park (off Springfield Avenue across from Union College) is named for a tributary of the Rahway River that runs through it, to Lenape Park to Echo Lake Park in Westfield and Springfield, called Nomahegan Brook. The name &quot;Nomahegan&quot; has had many different spellings in the historical sources (such as &quot;Normahiggins&quot;) and may mean &quot;she-wolf&quot; or &quot;women Mohegans.&quot; According to the Federal Writers&#x27; Project, &quot;The WPA Guide to New Jersey: The Garden State&quot; (1939): &quot;CRANFORD is an old residential town spread along the Rahway River Parkway, a link of nearly 7 miles joining a series of county parks and playgrounds with the Essex County park system. There are facilities for summer and winter sports, a rifle range, and picnic grove. The Fourth of July canoe regatta is an annual affair. Gardens of fine old Victorian houses line the edge of the parkway on the riverbank. A broadening of the river parkway at the northern end of Cranford is known as Nomahegan Park. The name Nomahegan is a variation of Noluns Mohegans, as the New Jersey Indians were called in the treaty ending the Indian troubles in 1758. It is translated as women Mohegans or she-wolves and was applied to them in scorn by the fighting Iroquois. In 2019, the county purchased a long-abandoned house and demolished it, adding the land to the park&#x27;s footprint.
* Droescher&#x27;s Mill Park, located near the dam at Droescher&#x27;s Mill on High Street. Also called Squire Williams Park.
* Mohawk Park is located on Mohawk Drive in Cranford&#x27;s Indian Village section of town.
* Sperry Park (named after William Miller Sperry), located off North Union Avenue. Home of annual rubber duck derby as a fundraiser for Hanson Park further upstream on the Rahway River.
* Unami Park (located at Lexington and S. Union Avenue).

=== Rahway River Parkway – Cranford Section ===

The Rahway River Parkway is a greenway of parkland that hugs the Rahway River and its tributaries. It was designed in the 1920s by the Olmsted Brothers firm, who were the sons of the eminent landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted. The Cranford section follows the banks of the meandering Rahway River as it flows south through Lenape Park, Nomahegan Park, Hampton Park, MacConnell Park, Hanson Park, Sperry Park, Crane&#x27;s Park, Droescher&#x27;s Mill Park, and Mohawk Park.

==== Cranford Riverwalk ====
The Cranford Riverwalk and Heritage Corridor portion of the Rahway River Parkway begins at the parklands near where Orange Avenue meets Springfield at the Cranford Canoe Club and follows the Rahway River on its path southbound to the Williams-Droescher Mill from the early 18th century. At Heritage Plaza at the southwest corner of South Avenue and Centennial, the century-old stone walls and iconic stone columns winding through woodland to Droescher&#x27;s Mill are still in place, but are in need of restoration and preservation.
Future plans include repairing the Kaltenbach Estate skating pond, the Victorian footbridge and Squire Williams Picnic Grove at Droescher&#x27;s Mill Park.

<text>Antiochus III the Great (; , ; 3 July 187 BC) was the sixth ruler of the Seleucid Empire, reigning from 223 to 187 BC. He ruled over the region of Syria and large parts of the rest of West Asia towards the end of the 3rd century BC. Rising to the throne at the age of eighteen in April/June 223 BC, his early campaigns against the Ptolemaic Kingdom were unsuccessful, but in the following years Antiochus gained several military victories and substantially expanded the empire&#x27;s territory. His traditional designation, &quot;the Great&quot;, reflects an epithet he assumed. He also assumed the title &quot;Basileus Megas&quot; (Greek for &#x27;Great King&#x27;), the traditional title of the Persian kings. A militarily active ruler, Antiochus restored much of the territory of the Seleucid Empire, before suffering a serious setback, towards the end of his reign, in his war against the Roman Republic. Declaring himself the &quot;champion of Greek freedom against Roman domination&quot;, he waged a four-year war against Rome beginning in mainland Greece in the autumn of 192 BC before being decisively defeated at the Battle of Magnesia. He died three years later on campaign in the east.

==Biography==

===Background and early reign===

Antiochus III was a member of the Hellenistic Seleucid dynasty. He was the son of king Seleucus II Callinicus and Laodice II, aunt of Seleucus, and was born around 242 BC near Susa in Persia. He may have initially borne a non-dynastic name (starting with Ly-), according to a Babylonian chronicle. He succeeded, under the name Antiochus, his brother Seleucus III Ceraunus, upon the latter&#x27;s murder in Anatolia; he was in Babylon at the time.

Antiochus III inherited a disorganized state. Not only had Asia Minor become detached, but the easternmost provinces had broken away, Bactria under the Seleucid Diodotus of Bactria, and Parthia under the rebel satrap Andragoras in 247–245 BC, who was himself later vanquished by the nomad chieftain Arsaces. In 222 BC, soon after Antiochus&#x27;s accession, Media and Persis revolted under their governors, the brothers Molon and Alexander. The young king, under the influence of the minister Hermeias, headed an attack on Ptolemaic Syria instead of going in person to face the rebels. The attack against the Ptolemaic empire proved a fiasco, and the generals sent against Molon and Alexander met with disaster. Only in Asia Minor, where the king&#x27;s cousin, Achaeus, represented the Seleucid cause, did its prestige recover, driving the Pergamene power back to its earlier limits.

In 221 BC Antiochus at last went far east, and the rebellion of Molon and Alexander collapsed which Polybius attributes in part to his following the advice of Zeuxis rather than Hermeias. The submission of Lesser Media, which had asserted its independence under Artabazanes, followed. Antiochus conspired with his physician and allies to have Hermeias assassinated, and then returned to Syria (220 BC). Meanwhile, Achaeus himself had revolted and assumed the title of king in Asia Minor. Though, due to the brewing mutiny of his troops arising from their dissatisfaction over his rebellion against their king, Achaeus desisted from his attempted coup and retreated. While sending additional threats to Achaeus, Antiochus left him for the time being and renewed his attempts on Ptolemaic Syria.

===Early wars against other Hellenistic rulers===
The campaigns of 219 BC and 218 BC carried the Seleucid armies almost to the confines of the Ptolemaic Kingdom, but in 217 BC Ptolemy IV defeated Antiochus at the Battle of Raphia. This defeat nullified all Antiochus&#x27;s successes and compelled him to withdraw north of Lebanon. In 216 BC his army marched into western Anatolia to suppress the local rebellion led by Antiochus&#x27;s own cousin Achaeus, and had by 214 BC driven him from the field into Sardis. Capturing Achaeus, Antiochus had him executed. The citadel managed to hold out until 213 BC under Achaeus&#x27;s widow Laodice who surrendered later.

Having thus recovered the central part of Asia Minor (for the Seleucid government had perforce to tolerate the dynasties in Pergamon, Bithynia and Cappadocia), Antiochus turned to recovering the outlying provinces of the north and east. He besieged Xerxes of Sophene in 212 BC, who had refused to pay tribute, and forced his capitulation. In 209 BC Antiochus invaded Parthia, occupied the capital Hecatompylos and pushed forward into Hyrcania, winning the Battle of Mount Labus. The Parthian king Arsaces II apparently successfully sued for peace.
===Bactrian campaign and Indian expedition===
The year 209 BC saw Antiochus in Bactria, where the Greco-Bactrian king Euthydemus I had supplanted the original rebel. Antiochus again met with success. Euthydemus was defeated by Antiochus at the Battle of the Arius, but after resisting the Seleucid king in the Siege of Bactra, he obtained an honourable peace by which Antiochus promised Euthydemus&#x27;s son Demetrius the hand of Laodice, his daughter, and allowed Euthydemus himself to keep his royal title.

Antiochus next, following in the steps of Alexander, crossed into the Kabul valley, reaching the realm of Indian king Sophagasenus and returned west by way of Seistan and Kerman (206/5). According to Polybius:

===Persia and Coele Syria campaigns===
From Seleucia on the Tigris he led a short expedition down the Persian Gulf against the Gerrhaeans of the Arabian coast (205 BC/204 BC). Antiochus seemed to have restored the Seleucid empire in the east, which earned him the title of &quot;the Great&quot; (Antiochos Megas). In 205/204 BC the infant Ptolemy V Epiphanes succeeded to the Egyptian throne, and Antiochus is said (notably by Polybius) to have concluded a secret pact with Philip V of Macedon for the partition of the Ptolemaic possessions. Under the terms of this pact, Macedon was to receive the Ptolemaic possessions around the Aegean Sea and Cyrene, while Antiochus would annex Cyprus and Egypt.

Once more Antiochus attacked the Ptolemaic province of Coele Syria and Phoenicia, and by 199 BC he seems to have had possession of it before the Aetolian leader Scopas recovered it for Ptolemy. But that recovery proved brief, for in 198 BC Antiochus defeated Scopas at the Battle of Panium, near the sources of the Jordan, a battle which marks the end of Ptolemaic rule in Judea.

===War against Rome and death===

Antiochus then moved to Asia Minor, by land and by sea, to secure the coast towns which belonged to the remnants of Ptolemaic overseas dominions and the independent Greek cities. This enterprise earned him the antagonism of the Roman Republic, since Smyrna and Lampsacus appealed to the Republic, which at the time acted as a defender of Greek freedom. The tension grew when Antiochus in 196 BC established a footing in Thrace. The evacuation of Greece by the Romans gave Antiochus his opportunity, and he now had the fugitive Hannibal at his court to urge him on.

In 192 BC Antiochus invaded Greece with a 10,000-man army, and was elected the commander in chief of the Aetolian League. In 191 BC, however, the Romans under Manius Acilius Glabrio routed him at Thermopylae, forcing him to withdraw to Asia Minor. The Romans followed up their success by invading Anatolia, and the decisive victory of Scipio Asiaticus at Magnesia ad Sipylum (190 BC), following the defeat of Hannibal at sea off Side, delivered Asia Minor into their hands.

By the Treaty of Apamea (188 BC) Antiochus abandoned all the country north and west of the Taurus Mountains, most of which the Roman Republic gave either to Rhodes or to the Attalid ruler Eumenes II, its allies (many Greek cities were left free). As a consequence of this blow to the Seleucid power, the outlying provinces of the empire, recovered by Antiochus, reasserted their independence. Antiochus mounted a fresh eastern expedition in Luristan, where he was killed while pillaging a temple of Bel at Elymaïs, Persia, in 187 BC.

==Family==

In 222 BC, Antiochus III married Princess Laodice of Pontus, a daughter of King Mithridates II of Pontus and Princess Laodice of the Seleucid Empire. The couple were first cousins through their mutual grandfather, Antiochus II Theos. Antiochus and Laodice had eight children (three sons and five daughters):
*Antiochus (221–193 BC), Antiochus III&#x27;s first heir apparent and joint-king with his father from 210 to 193 BC
*Seleucus IV Philopator (c. 220175 BC), Antiochus III&#x27;s successor
*Ardys
*Daughter (name unknown), betrothed in about 206 BC to Demetrius I of Bactria
*Laodice IV, married all three of her brothers in succession and became Queen of the Seleucid Empire through her second and third marriages
*Cleopatra I Syra (c. 204176 BC), married in 193 BC Ptolemy V Epiphanes of Egypt
*Antiochis, married in 194 BC King Ariarathes IV of Cappadocia
*Mithridates (215–164 BC), succeeded his brother Seleucus IV Philopator in 175 BC under the regnal name Antiochus IV Epiphanes

In 191 BC, Antiochus III married a girl from Chalcis, whom he named &quot;Euboea&quot;. They had no children. Laodice III may have fallen in disgrace; however, she clearly survived Antiochus III, and appears in Susa in 183 BC.

==Antiochus and the Jews==
Antiochus III resettled 2000 Jewish families from Babylonia into the Hellenistic Anatolian regions of Lydia and Phrygia. Josephus portrays him as friendly towards the Jews of Jerusalem and cognizant of their loyalty to him (see Antiquities of the Jews, Book XII, Chapter 3), in stark contrast to the attitude of his son. In fact, Antiochus III lowered taxes, granted subventions to the Temple, and let the Jews live, as Josephus puts it, &quot;according to the law of their forefathers.&quot;

== Books of Maccabees ==
Antiochus III is mentioned in the deuterocanonical &quot;Books of the Maccabees.&quot; The subject of Maccabees is the Maccabean Revolt against Antiochus&#x27; son, Antiochus IV Epiphanes. Antiochus III is first mentioned in 1 Maccabees 1:10, when Antiochus IV is introduced as &quot;son of King Antiochus [Antiochus III]&quot;. Antiochus III is mentioned later in 1 Maccabees 8, which describes Judas Maccabeus&#x27; knowledge of the deeds of the Roman Republic, including an allusion to the defeat of Antiochus III by the Romans. The NRSV says &quot;They [the Romans] also had defeated Antiochus the Great, king of Asia, who went to fight against them with one hundred twenty elephants and with cavalry and chariots and a very large army. He was crushed by them; they took him alive and decreed that he and those who would reign after him should pay a heavy tribute and give hostages and surrender some of their best provinces, the countries of India, Media, and Lydia. These they took from him and gave to King Eumenes.&quot; (1 Maccabees 8:6-8)

==Cultural portrayals==
*During the Caroline era, the play &quot;Believe as You List&quot; was centred around Antiochus&#x27;s resistance to the Romans after the Battle of Thermopylae. The play was originally about Sebastian of Portugal surviving the Battle of Alcazar, returning and trying to gather support to return to the throne. This first version was censored for being considered &quot;subversive&quot; because it portrayed Sebastian being deposed, it had comments in favour of an Anglo-Spanish alliance and it was possibly pro-Catholic. That led to the final version changing to the story of Antiochus, which led to historical inaccuracy in exaggerating his defeat at that phase in history to fit the earlier text and turning Spaniards into Romans and the Catholic eremite into a Stoic philosopher.
*Antiochus features towards the end of Norman Barrow&#x27;s historical novel, &quot;The High Priest&quot; (Faber &amp; Faber, 1947), after his forces have reacquired Jerusalem from the Ptolemaic occupation. The book was noted by John Betjeman in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; as &quot;interesting&quot;.

<doc id="84553" wikidata="Q13360160" url="?curid=84553" title="Lotus Symphony (MS-DOS)">
<text>Lotus Symphony was an integrated software package for creating and editing text, spreadsheets, charts and other documents on the MS-DOS operating systems. It was released by Lotus Development as a follow-on to its popular spreadsheet program, Lotus 1-2-3, and was produced from 1984 to 1992. Lotus Jazz on the Apple Macintosh was a sibling product.

IBM revived the name Lotus Symphony in 2007 for a new office suite based on OpenOffice.org, but the two programs are otherwise unrelated.

==History==
Lotus 1-2-3 had originally been billed as an integrated product with spreadsheet, database and graphing functions (hence the name &quot;1-2-3&quot;). Other products described as &quot;integrated&quot;, such as Ashton-Tate&#x27;s Framework and AppleWorks, from Apple Computer, normally included word processor functionality. Symphony was Lotus&#x27; response.

==Overview==

Symphony for MS-DOS is a program that loads entirely into memory on startup, and can run as an MS-DOS task on versions of Microsoft Windows (3.x/95/98/ME). Using the Command Prompt, and a .pif file, Symphony can also be used on Windows XP and its successors.

Using ALT+F10 the user can alternate among the five &quot;environments&quot; of the program, each a rendering of the same underlying data. The environments are:
*SHEET, a spreadsheet program very similar to 1-2-3
*DOC, a word processor
*GRAPH, a graphical charting program
*FORM, a table-based database management system
*COMM, a communications program

Several &quot;add-in applications&quot; can be &quot;attached&quot; and activated, extending Symphony&#x27;s capabilities, including a powerful macro manager, a document outliner, a spell-checker, statistics, various communications configurations, and a tutorial, which demonstrates Symphony usage by running macros. The program allows the screen to be split into panes and distinct Windows, showing different views of the underlying data simultaneously, each of which can display any of the five environments. The user is then able to see that changes made in one environment are reflected in others simultaneously, perhaps the package&#x27;s most interesting feature.

All the data that Symphony handles is kept in spreadsheet-like cells. The other environments—word processing, database, communications, graphics—in essence only change the display format and focus of that data (including available menus, special keys, and functionality), which can be saved and retrieved as .WR1 files.

Symphony was designed to work completely in the standard 640k of conventional memory, supplemented by any expanded memory. Similar and competitive packages included SmartWare, Microsoft Works, Context MBA, Framework, Enable and Ability Office.

Symphony&#x27;s spreadsheet engine was similar to, but not the same as the one used in Lotus 1-2-3, once the most popular of its kind. Additional enhancements included:

*The ability to create unique application looking spreadsheets using customizable macro driven menus and display Windows, the result being menu driven applications that, to the user, resembled little of their original spreadsheet heritage.
*A rearranged worksheet menu, placing COPY as the first menu item, then the other most frequently used items after that.
*Additional @ formula functions building on 1-2-3&#x27;s spreadsheet only formulas.
*Multiple menu systems, retaining 1-2-3&#x27;s uniquely identified first-character menu items.
*The addition of the TAB key to anchor ranges, instead of just using the period key.
*The ability to copy &quot;to a location&quot; and end up at that location, instead of at the copy &quot;from location.&quot;

Symphony put the power of the spreadsheet at the user&#x27;s fingertips and used all of the available keys on IBM&#x27;s 84-key PC keyboard. In this way, the user could use both hands to select menu functions, navigate menus and spreadsheets, as well as, all other Symphony functions by touch. The introduction of the US IBM PC 104-key keyboard and later ergonomic keyboards diluted this advantage.

Compared to other word processors of the day such as Micropro WordStar 3.3, WordPerfect 4.2, and Microsoft Word 2.0, Symphony&#x27;s word processing environment was simple, but effective and uncomplicated.

Compared to other database programs of the day—Ashton-Tate&#x27;s dBase III, MDBS Knowledgeman, Borland Paradox 2.0 and Borland Reflex 1.0—Symphony&#x27;s FORM environment was not as robust, lacking the analytical abilities of Reflex and the pseudo relational power of dBase III. However, it was integrated directly into the spreadsheet and included the ability to &quot;generate&quot; a FORM from spreadsheet fields. The generator would automatically create the database input form, all the underlying spreadsheet architecture, with range names and query fields, turning a simple spreadsheet into an instant database in seconds. 3.0-Symphony extended earlier enhancements with additional add-ons, most notably:

*WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) GUI (graphical user interface) and the addition of mouse support
*BASE, the ability to integrate with any dBase IV file, no matter its size.
*ExtraK add-on, extending memory capabilities for spreadsheet larger than 4MB.

Like its predecessor Lotus 1-2-3, Symphony contained a reasonably powerful programming language referred to as its &quot;Symphony Command Language (or SCL) &quot;, which could be saved either within a spreadsheet or separately in &quot;libraries&quot; in the form of &quot;macros&quot;: lists of menu operations, data, and other macro keywords. (One is &quot;menucall,&quot; which allows users to call their own menus, embedded into spreadsheets, which behave just like Symphony&#x27;s own.) Symphony&#x27;s &quot;learn&quot; mode for macro recording automated this process, helping the end-user to quickly write macros to duplicate repetitive tasks or to go beyond that, without the need to understand computer programming. One of the most significant features of Symphony was the integration of the various modules using this command language. In its day, it was one of the few programs that would be able to log onto a stock market source, select data using dynamic or pre-assigned criteria, place that data into a spreadsheet, perform calculations, then chart the data and print out the results. All of this could take place unattended on a preset schedule.

<doc id="84554" wikidata="Q184176" url="?curid=84554" title="Seleucus I Nicator">
<text>Seleucus I Nicator (; Greek: Σέλευκος Νικάτωρ, &quot;Séleukos Nikátōr&quot;, &quot;Seleucus the Victorious&quot;; ) was a Macedonian Greek general, officer and successor of Alexander the Great who went on to found the eponymous Seleucid Empire, led by the Seleucid dynasty. Initially a secondary player in the power struggles following Alexander&#x27;s death, Seleucus rose to become the total ruler of Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and the Iranian plateau, assuming the title of &quot;basileus&quot; (king). The Seleucid Empire was one of the major powers of the Hellenistic world, until it was overcome by the Roman Republic and Parthian Empire in the late second and early first centuries BC.

While serving under Alexander, Seleucus was commander of the &quot;Hypaspistai,&quot; an elite Macedonian infantry unit. After the death of Alexander in June 323 BC, Seleucus initially supported Perdiccas, the regent of Alexander&#x27;s empire, and was appointed Commander of the Companions and chiliarch at the Partition of Babylon in 323 BC. However, after the outbreak of the Wars of the Diadochi in 322, Perdiccas&#x27; military failures against Ptolemy in Egypt led to the mutiny of his troops in Pelusium. Perdiccas was betrayed and assassinated in a conspiracy by Seleucus, Peithon and Antigenes in Pelusium sometime in either 321 or 320 BC. At the Partition of Triparadisus in 321 BC, Seleucus was appointed Satrap of Babylon under the new regent Antipater. But almost immediately, the wars between the Diadochi resumed and one of the most powerful of the Diadochi, Antigonus, forced Seleucus to flee Babylon. Seleucus was only able to return to Babylon in 312 BC with the support of Ptolemy. From 312 BC, Seleucus ruthlessly expanded his dominions and eventually conquered the Persian and Median lands. Seleucus ruled not only Babylonia, but the entire eastern part of Alexander&#x27;s empire.

Seleucus further made claim to the former satrapies in Gandhara and in northwest India. However these ambitions were contested by Chandragupta Maurya, resulting in the Seleucid–Mauryan War (305–303 BC). The conflict was ultimately resolved by a treaty resulting in the Maurya Empire annexing the eastern satrapies. Additionally, a marriage alliance was formed, with Chandragupta marrying a daughter of Seleucus, according to Strabo and Appian. Furthermore, the Seleucid Empire received a considerable military force of 500 war elephants with mahouts, which would play a decisive role against Antigonus at the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC. In 281 BC, he also defeated Lysimachus at the Battle of Corupedium, adding Asia Minor to his empire. 

Seleucus&#x27; victories against Antigonus and Lysimachus left the Seleucid dynasty virtually unopposed amongst the Diadochi. However, Seleucus also hoped to take control of Lysimachus&#x27; European territories, primarily Thrace and Macedon itself. But upon arriving in Thrace in 281 BC, Seleucus was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus, who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court with his sister Lysandra. The assassination of Seleucus destroyed Seleucid prospects in Thrace and Macedon, and paved the way for Ptolemy Ceraunus to absorb much of Lysimachus&#x27; former power in Macedon. Seleucus was succeeded by his son Antiochus I as ruler of the Seleucid Empire. Seleucus founded a number of new cities during his reign, including Antioch (300 BC), Edessa and Seleucia on the Tigris (c. 305 BC), a foundation that eventually depopulated Babylon.

==Youth and family==
Seleucus was the son of Antiochus. Historian Junianus Justinus claims that Antiochus was one of Philip II of Macedon&#x27;s generals, but no such general is mentioned in any other sources, and nothing is known of his supposed career under Philip. It is possible that Antiochus was a member of an upper Macedonian noble family. Seleucus&#x27; mother was supposedly called Laodice, but nothing else is known of her. Later, Seleucus named a number of cities after his parents. Seleucus was born in Europus, located in the northern part of Macedonia. Just a year before his birth (if the year 358 BC is accepted as the most likely date), the Paeonians invaded the region. Philip defeated the invaders and only a few years later utterly subdued them under Macedonian rule. Seleucus&#x27; year of birth is unclear. Justin claims he was 77 years old during the battle of Corupedium, which would place his year of birth at 358 BC. Appian tells us Seleucus was 73 years old during the battle, which means 354 BC would be the year of birth. Eusebius of Caesarea, however, mentions the age of 75, and thus the year 356 BC, making Seleucus the same age as Alexander the Great. This is most likely propaganda on Seleucus&#x27; part to make him seem comparable to Alexander.

As a teenager, Seleucus was chosen to serve as the king&#x27;s page (&quot;pais&quot;). It was customary for all male offspring of noble families to first serve in this position and later as officers in the king&#x27;s army.

Seleucus, like his later rivals Antigonus and Demetrius, was reportedly a very powerful man. Appian wrote of an incident in which a wild bull that was about to be sacrificed by Alexander broke free of its bounds, and Seleucus managed to recapture the animal by grabbing and holding unto its horns with his bare hands. This was apparently the reason for the bull horns in the coins he later minted.

A number of legends, similar to those told of Alexander the Great, were told of Seleucus. It was said Antiochus told his son before he left to battle the Persians with Alexander that his real father was actually the god Apollo. The god had left a ring with a picture of an anchor as a gift to Laodice. Seleucus had a birthmark shaped like an anchor. It was told that Seleucus&#x27; sons and grandsons also had similar birthmarks. The story is similar to the one told about Alexander. Most likely the story is propaganda invented to present Seleucus as the natural successor of Alexander.

John Malalas tells us Seleucus had a sister called Didymeia, who had sons called Nicanor and Nicomedes. It is most likely the sons are fictitious. Didymeia might refer to the oracle of Apollo in Didyma near Miletus. It has also been suggested that Ptolemy (son of Seleucus) was actually the uncle of Seleucus.

==Early career under Alexander the Great==

In spring 334 BC, as a young man of about twenty-three, Seleucus accompanied Alexander into Asia. By the time of the Indian campaigns beginning in late in 327 BC, he had risen to the command of the elite infantry corps in the Macedonian army, the &quot;Shield-bearers&quot; (&quot;Hypaspistai&quot;, later known as the &quot;Silvershields&quot;). It is said by Arrian that when Alexander crossed the Hydaspes river on a boat, he was accompanied by Perdiccas, Ptolemy I Soter, Lysimachus and also Seleucus. During the subsequent Battle of the Hydaspes (326 BC), Seleucus led his troops against the elephants of King Porus. It is unknown the extent in which Seleucus participated in the actual planning of the battle, as he is not mentioned as holding any major independent position during the battle. This contrasts with Craterus, Hephaistion, Peithon and Leonnatus – each of whom had sizable detachments under their control. Seleucus&#x27; Royal &quot;Hypaspistai&quot; were constantly under Alexander&#x27;s eye and at his disposal. They later participated in the Indus Valley campaign, in the battles fought against the Malli and in the crossing of the Gedrosian desert.

At the great marriage ceremony at Susa in the spring of 324 BC, Seleucus married Apama, daughter of Spitamenes. They had his eldest son and successor Antiochus I Soter, at least two legitimate daughters (Laodice and Phila) and possibly another son (Achaeus). At the same event, Alexander married the daughter of the late Persian King Darius III while several other Macedonians married Persian women. After Alexander&#x27;s death (323 BC), when the other senior Macedonian officers unloaded their &quot;Susa wives&quot; &quot;en masse&quot;, Seleucus was one of the very few who kept his wife, and Apama remained his consort (later Queen) for the rest of her life.

Ancient sources report several anecdotes about Seleucus&#x27; activities during the life of Alexander. In the first of these episodes, he participated in a sailing trip near Babylon, where Alexander&#x27;s diadem was blown off his head and landed on some reeds near the tombs of Assyrian kings. Seleucus swam to fetch the diadem back, placing it on his own head while returning to the boat to keep it dry. The validity of the story is dubious. In the second, he took part in the dinner party of Medeios the Thessalian with Alexander. The story of the dinner party of Medeios may be true, but the plot to poison the King is unlikely. In the final story, Seleucus reportedly slept in the temple of the god Serapis shortly before Alexander&#x27;s death in the hope that his health might improve. The validity of this story is also questionable, as the Graeco-Egyptian Serapis had not yet been invented at the time.

==Senior officer under Perdiccas (323–321 BC)==

Alexander the Great died without a successor in Babylon on June 10, 323 BC. His general Perdiccas became the regent of all of Alexander&#x27;s empire, while Alexander&#x27;s physically and mentally disabled half-brother Arrhidaeus was chosen as the next king under the name Philip III of Macedon. Alexander&#x27;s unborn child (Alexander IV) was also named his father&#x27;s successor. In the &quot;Partition of Babylon&quot; however, Perdiccas effectively divided the enormous Macedonian dominion among Alexander&#x27;s generals. Seleucus was chosen to command the Companion cavalry (&quot;hetairoi&quot;) and appointed first or court chiliarch, which made him the senior officer in the Royal Army after the regent and commander-in-chief Perdiccas. Several other powerful men supported Perdiccas, including Ptolemy, Lysimachus, Peithon and Eumenes. Perdiccas&#x27; power depended on his ability to hold Alexander&#x27;s enormous empire together, and on whether he could force the satraps to obey him.

War soon broke out between Perdiccas and the other Diadochi. To cement his position, Perdiccas tried to marry Alexander&#x27;s sister Cleopatra. The First War of the Diadochi began when Perdiccas sent Alexander&#x27;s corpse to Macedonia for burial. Ptolemy however captured the body and took it to Alexandria. Perdiccas and his troops followed him to Egypt, whereupon Ptolemy conspired with the satrap of Media, Peithon, and the commander of the &quot;Argyraspides&quot;, Antigenes, both serving as officers under Perdiccas, and assassinated him. Cornelius Nepos mentions that Seleucus also took part in this conspiracy, but this is not certain.

==Satrap of Babylonia (321–316 BC)==

The most powerful man in the empire after the death of Perdiccas was Antipater. Perdiccas&#x27; opponents gathered in Triparadisos, where the empire of Alexander was partitioned again (the Treaty of Triparadisus 321 BC).

At Triparadisos the soldiers had become mutinous and were planning to murder their master Antipater. Seleucus and Antigonus, however, prevented this. For betraying Perdiccas, Seleucus was awarded the rich province of Babylon. This decision may have been Antigonus&#x27; idea. Seleucus&#x27; Babylon was surrounded by Peucestas, the satrap of Persis; Antigenes, the new satrap of Susiana and Peithon of Media. Babylon was one of the wealthiest provinces of the empire, but its military power was insignificant. It is possible that Antipater divided the eastern provinces so that no single satrap could rise above the others in power.

After the death of Alexander, Archon of Pella was chosen satrap of Babylon. Perdiccas, however, had plans to supersede Archon and nominate Docimus as his successor. During his invasion of Egypt, Perdiccas sent Docimus along with his detachments to Babylon. Archon waged war against him, but fell in battle. Thus, Docimus was not intending to give Babylon to Seleucus without a fight. It is not certain how Seleucus took Babylon from Docimus, but according to one Babylonian chronicle an important building was destroyed in the city during the summer or winter of 320 BC. Other Babylonian sources state that Seleucus arrived in Babylon in October or November 320 BC. Despite the presumed battle, Docimus was able to escape.

Meanwhile, the empire was once again in turmoil. Peithon, the satrap of Media, assassinated Philip, the satrap of Parthia, and replaced him with his brother Eudemus as the new satrap. In the west Antigonus and Eumenes waged war against each other. Just like Peithon and Seleucus, Eumenes was one of the former supporters of Perdiccas. Seleucus&#x27; biggest problem was, however, Babylon itself. The locals had rebelled against Archon and supported Docimus. The Babylonian priesthood had great influence over the region. Babylon also had a sizeable population of Macedonian and Greek veterans of Alexander&#x27;s army. Seleucus won over the priests with monetary gifts and bribes.

===Second War of the Diadochi===

After the death of Antipater in 319 BC, the satrap of Media began to expand his power. Peithon assembled a large army of perhaps over 20,000 soldiers. Under the leadership of Peucestas the other satraps of the region brought together an opposing army of their own. Peithon was finally defeated in a battle waged in Parthia. He escaped to Media, but his opponents did not follow him and rather returned to Susiana. Meanwhile, Eumenes and his army had arrived at Cilicia, but had to retreat when Antigonus reached the city. The situation was difficult for Seleucus. Eumenes and his army were north of Babylon; Antigonus was following him with an even larger army; Peithon was in Media and his opponents in Susiana. Antigenes, satrap of Susiana and commander of the Argyraspides, was allied with Eumenes. Antigenes was in Cilicia when the war between him and Peithon began.

Peithon arrived at Babylon in the autumn or winter of 317 BC. Peithon had lost a large number of troops, but Seleucus had even fewer soldiers. Eumenes decided to march to Susa in the spring of 316 BC. The satraps in Susa had apparently accepted Eumenes&#x27; claims of his fighting on behalf of the lawful ruling family against the usurper Antigonus. Eumenes marched his army 300 stadions away from Babylon and tried to cross the Tigris. Seleucus had to act. He sent two triremes and some smaller ships to stop the crossing. He also tried to get the former &quot;hypasiti&quot; of the Argyraspides to join him, but this did not happen. Seleucus also sent messages to Antigonus. Because of his lack of troops, Seleucus apparently had no plans to actually stop Eumenes. He opened the flood barriers of the river, but the resulting flood did not stop Eumenes.

In the spring of 316 BC, Seleucus and Peithon joined Antigonus, who was following Eumenes to Susa. From Susa Antigonus went to Media, from where he could threaten the eastern provinces. He left Seleucus with a small number of troops to prevent Eumenes from reaching the Mediterranean. Sibyrtius, satrap of Arachosia, saw the situation as hopeless and returned to his own province. The armies of Eumenes and his allies were at breaking point. Antigonus and Eumenes had two encounters during 316 BC, in the battles of Paraitacene and Gabiene. Eumenes was defeated and executed. The events of the Second War of the Diadochi revealed Seleucus&#x27; ability to wait for the right moment. Blazing into battle was not his style.

===Escape to Egypt===
Antigonus spent the winter of 316 BC in Media, whose ruler was once again Peithon. Peithon&#x27;s lust for power had grown, and he tried to get a portion of Antigonus&#x27; troops to revolt to his side. Antigonus, however, discovered the plot and executed Peithon. He then superseded Peucestas as satrap of Persia. In the summer of 315 BC Antigonus arrived in Babylon and was warmly welcomed by Seleucus. The relationship between the two soon turned cold, however. Seleucus punished one of Antigonus&#x27; officers without asking permission from Antigonus. Antigonus became angry and demanded that Seleucus give him the income from the province, which Seleucus refused to do. He was, however, afraid of Antigonus and fled to Egypt with 50 horsemen. It is told that Chaldean astrologers prophesied to Antigonus that Seleucus would become master of Asia and would kill Antigonus. After hearing this, Antigonus sent soldiers after Seleucus, who had however first escaped to Mesopotamia and then to Syria. Antigonus executed Blitor, the new satrap of Mesopotamia, for helping Seleucus. Modern scholars are skeptical of the prophecy story. It seems certain, however, that the Babylonian priesthood was against Seleucus.

During Seleucus&#x27; escape to Egypt, Macedonia was undergoing great turmoil. Alexander the Great&#x27;s mother Olympias had been invited back to Macedon by Polyperchon in order to drive Cassander out. She held great respect among the Macedonian army but lost some of this when she had Philip III and his wife Eurydice killed as well as many nobles whom she took revenge upon for supporting Antipater during his long reign. Cassander reclaimed Macedon the following year at Pydna and then had her killed. Alexander IV, still a young child, and his mother Roxane were held guarded at Amphipolis and died under mysterious circumstances in 310 BC, probably murdered at the instigation of Cassander to allow the diadochs to assume the title of king.

==Admiral under Ptolemy (316–311 BC)==

After arriving in Egypt, Seleucus sent his friends to Greece to inform his fellow Diadochi Cassander (ruler of Macedon and overlord of Greece) and Lysimachus (ruler of Thracia) about Antigonus. Antigonus was now the most powerful of the &quot;Diadochi&quot;, and the others would soon have to face him. Ptolemy, Lysimachus and Cassander formed a coalition against Antigonus. The allies sent a proposition to Antigonus in which they demanded shares of his accumulated treasure and of his territory, with Phoenica and Syria going to Ptolemy, Cappadocia and Lycia to Cassander, Hellespontine Phrygia to Lysimachus, and Babylonia to Seleucus. Antigonus refused, and in the spring of 314 BC, he marched against Ptolemy in Syria. Seleucus acted as an admiral to Ptolemy during the first phase of the war. Antigonus was besieging Tyre, when Seleucus sailed past him and went on to threaten the coast of Syria and Asia Minor. Antigonus allied with the island of Rhodes, which had a strategic location and a navy capable of preventing the allies from combining their forces. Because of the threat of Rhodes, Ptolemy gave Seleucus a hundred ships and sent him to the Aegean Sea. The fleet was too small to defeat Rhodes, but it was big enough to force Asander, the satrap of Caria, to ally with Ptolemy. To demonstrate his power, Seleucus also invaded the city of Erythrai. Polemaios, a nephew of Antigonus, attacked Asander. Seleucus returned to Cyprus, where Ptolemy I had sent his brother Menelaos along with 10,000 mercenaries and 100 ships. Seleucus and Menelaos began to besiege Kition. Antigonus sent most of his fleet to the Aegean Sea and his army to Asia Minor. Ptolemy now had an opportunity to invade Syria, where he defeated Demetrius, the son of Antigonus, in the battle of Gaza in 312 BC. It is probable that Seleucus took part in the battle. Peithon, son of Agenor, whom Antigonus had nominated as the new satrap of Babylon, fell in the battle. The death of Peithon gave Seleucus an opportunity to return to Babylon.

Seleucus had prepared his return to Babylon well. After the battle of Gaza Demetrius retreated to Tripoli while Ptolemy advanced all the way to Sidon. Ptolemy gave Seleucus 800 infantry and 200 cavalry. He also had his friends accompanying him, perhaps the same 50 who escaped with him from Babylon. On the way to Babylon Seleucus recruited more soldiers from the colonies along the route. He finally had about 3,000 soldiers. In Babylon, Peithon&#x27;s commander, Diphilus, barricaded himself in the city&#x27;s fortress. Seleucus conquered Babylon with great speed and the fortress was also quickly captured. Seleucus&#x27; friends who had stayed in Babylon were released from captivity. His return to Babylon was afterwards officially regarded as the beginning of the Seleucid Empire and that year as the first of the Seleucid era.

==Satrap of Babylonia (311–306 BC)==

===Conquest of the eastern provinces===

Soon after Seleucus&#x27; return, the supporters of Antigonus tried to get Babylon back. Nicanor was the new satrap of Media and the &quot;strategos&quot; of the eastern provinces. His army had about 17,000 soldiers. Evagoras, the satrap of Aria, was allied with him. It was obvious that Seleucus&#x27; small force could not defeat the two in battle. Seleucus hid his armies in the marshes that surrounded the area where Nicanor was planning to cross the Tigris and made a surprise attack during the night. Evagoras fell in the beginning of the battle and Nicanor was cut off from his forces. The news about the death of Evagoras spread among the soldiers, who started to surrender &quot;en masse&quot;. Almost all of them agreed to fight under Seleucus. Nicanor escaped with only a few men.

Even though Seleucus now had about 20,000 soldiers, they were not enough to withstand the forces of Antigonus. He also did not know when Antigonus would begin his counterattack. On the other hand, he knew that at least two eastern provinces did not have a satrap. A great majority of his own troops were from these provinces. Some of Evagoras&#x27; troops were Persian. Perhaps a portion of the troops were Eumenes&#x27; soldiers, who had a reason to hate Antigonus. Seleucus decided to take advantage of this situation.

Seleucus spread different stories among the provinces and the soldiers. According to one of them, he had in a dream seen Alexander standing beside him. Eumenes had tried to use a similar propaganda trick. Antigonus, who had been in Asia Minor while Seleucus had been in the east with Alexander, could not use Alexander in his own propaganda. Seleucus, being Macedonian, had the ability to gain the trust of the Macedonians among his troops, which was not the case with Eumenes.

After becoming once again satrap of Babylon, Seleucus became much more aggressive in his politics. In a short time he conquered Media and Susiana. Diodorus Siculus reports that Seleucus also conquered other nearby areas, which might refer to Persis, Aria or Parthia. Seleucus did not reach Bactria and Sogdiana. The satrap of the former was Stasanor, who had remained neutral during the conflicts. After the defeat of Nikanor&#x27;s army, there was no force in the east that could have opposed Seleucus. It is uncertain how Seleucus arranged the administration of the provinces he had conquered. Most satraps had died. In theory, Polyperchon was still the lawful successor of Antipater and the official regent of the Macedonian kingdom. It was his duty to select the satraps. However, Polyperchon was still allied with Antigonus and thus an enemy of Seleucus.

===Response===

Antigonus sent his son Demetrius along with 15,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry to reconquer Babylon. Apparently, he gave Demetrius a time limit, after which he had to return to Syria. Antigonus believed Seleucus was still ruling only Babylon. Perhaps Nicanor had not told him that Seleucus now had at least 20,000 soldiers. It seems that the scale of Nicanor&#x27;s defeat was not clear to all parties. Antigonus did not know Seleucus had conquered the majority of the eastern provinces and perhaps cared little about the eastern parts of the empire.

When Demetrius arrived in Babylon, Seleucus was somewhere in the east. He had left Patrocles to defend the city. Babylon was defended in an unusual way. It had two strong fortresses, in which Seleucus had left his garrisons. The inhabitants of the city were transferred out and settled in the neighbouring areas, some as far as Susa. The surroundings of Babylon were excellent for defence, with cities, swamps, canals and rivers. Demetrius&#x27; troops started to besiege the fortresses of Babylon and conquered one of them. The second fortress proved more difficult for Demetrius. He left his friend Archelaus to continue the siege, and himself returned west leaving 5,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry in Babylon. Ancient sources do not mention what happened to these troops. Perhaps Seleucus had to reconquer Babylon from Archelaus.

===Babylonian War===
Over the course of nine years (311–302 BC), while Antigonus was occupied in the west, Seleucus brought the whole eastern part of Alexander&#x27;s empire as far as the Jaxartes and Indus Rivers under his authority.

In 311 BC Antigonus made peace with Cassander, Lysimachus and Ptolemy, which gave him an opportunity to deal with Seleucus. Antigonus&#x27; army had at least 80,000 soldiers. Even if he left half of his troops in the west, he would still have a numerical advantage over Seleucus. Seleucus may have received help from Cossaians, whose ancestors were the ancient Kassites. Antigonus had devastated their lands while fighting Eumenes. Seleucus perhaps recruited a portion of Archelaus&#x27; troops. When Antigonus finally invaded Babylon, Seleucus&#x27; army was much bigger than before. Many of his soldiers certainly hated Antigonus. The population of Babylon was also hostile. Seleucus, thus, did not need to garrison the area to keep the locals from revolting.

Little information is available about the conflict between Antigonus and Seleucus; only a very rudimentary Babylonian chronicle detailing the events of the war remains. The description of the year 310 BC has completely disappeared. It seems that Antigonus conquered Babylon. His plans were disturbed, however, by Ptolemy, who made a surprise attack in Cilicia.

We do know that Seleucus defeated Antigonus in at least one decisive battle. This battle is only mentioned in &quot;Stratagems in War&quot; by Polyaenus. Polyaenus reports that the troops of Seleucus and Antigonus fought for a whole day, but when night came the battle was still undecided. The two forces agreed to rest for the night and continue in the morning. Antigonus&#x27; troops slept without their equipment. Seleucus ordered his forces to sleep and eat breakfast in battle formation. Shortly before dawn, Seleucus&#x27; troops attacked the forces of Antigonus, who were still without their weapons and in disarray and thus easily defeated. The historical accuracy of the story is questionable.

The Babylonian war finally ended in Seleucus&#x27; victory. Antigonus was forced to retreat west. Both sides fortified their borders. Antigonus built a series of fortresses along the Balikh River while Seleucus built a few cities, including Dura-Europos and Nisibis.

===Seleucia===
The next event connected to Seleucus was the founding of the city of Seleucia. The city was built on the shore of the Tigris probably in 307 or 305 BC. Seleucus made Seleucia his new capital, thus imitating Lysimachus, Cassander and Antigonus, all of whom had named cities after themselves. Seleucus also transferred the mint of Babylon to his new city. Babylon was soon left in the shadow of Seleucia, and the story goes that Antiochus, the son of Seleucus, moved the whole population of Babylon to his father&#x27;s namesake capital in 275 BC. The city flourished until AD 165, when the Romans destroyed it.

A story of the founding of the city goes as follows: Seleucus asked the Babylonian priests which day would be best to found the city. The priest calculated the day, but, wanting the founding to fail, told Seleucus a different date. The plot failed however, because when the correct day came, Seleucus&#x27; soldiers spontaneously started building the city. When questioned, the priests admitted their deed.

==King of the Seleucid empire (306–281 BC)==
The struggle among the Diadochi reached its climax when Antigonus, after the extinction of the old royal line of Macedonia, proclaimed himself king in 306 BC. Ptolemy, Lysimachus, Cassander and Seleucus, the other four principal Macedonian chiefs, soon followed and assumed the title and style of basileus (king).

===Chandragupta and the Eastern Provinces===

Seleucus soon turned his attention once again eastward. The Persian provinces in what is now modern Afghanistan, together with the wealthy kingdom of Gandhara and the states of the Indus Valley, had all submitted to Alexander the Great and become part of his empire. When Alexander died, the Wars of the Diadochi (&quot;Successors&quot;) split his empire apart; as his generals fought for control of Alexander&#x27;s empire. In the eastern territories, Seleucus I Nicator took control of Alexander&#x27;s conquests. According to the Roman historian Appian:

The Mauryans then annexed the areas around the Indus governed by the four Greek satraps: Nicanor, Phillip, Eudemus and Peithon. This established Mauryan control to the banks of the Indus. Chandragupta&#x27;s victories convinced Seleucus that he needed to secure his eastern flank. Seeking to hold the Macedonian territories there, Seleucus thus came into conflict with the emerging and expanding Mauryan Empire over the Indus Valley.

In the year 306 BC, Seleucus I Nicator went to India and apparently occupied territory as far as the Indus, and eventually waged war with the Maurya Emperor Chandragupta Maurya. Only a few sources mention his activities in India. Chandragupta (known in Greek sources as &quot;Sandrokottos&quot;), founder of the Mauryan empire, had conquered the Indus valley and several other parts of the easternmost regions of Alexander&#x27;s empire. Seleucus began a campaign against Chandragupta and crossed the Indus. Most western historians note that it appears to have fared poorly as he did not achieve his goals, even though what exactly happened is unknown. The two leaders ultimately reached an agreement, and through a treaty sealed in 303 BC, Seleucus abandoned the territories he could never securely hold in exchange for stabilizing the East and obtaining elephants, with which he could turn his attention against his great western rival, Antigonus Monophthalmus. The 500 war elephants Seleucus obtained from Chandragupta were to play a key role in the forthcoming battles, particularly at Ipsus against Antigonus and Demetrius. The Maurya king might have married the daughter of Seleucus. According to Strabo, the ceded territories bordered the Indus:
The geographical position of the tribes is as follows: along the Indus are the Paropamisadae, above whom lies the Paropamisus mountain: then, towards the south, the Arachoti: then next, towards the south, the Gedroseni, with the other tribes that occupy the seaboard; and the Indus lies, latitudinally, alongside all these places; and of these places, in part, some that lie along the Indus are held by Indians, although they formerly belonged to the Persians. Alexander [III &#x27;the Great&#x27; of Macedon] took these away from the Arians and established settlements of his own, but Seleucus Nicator gave them to Sandrocottus [Chandragupta], upon terms of intermarriage and of receiving in exchange five hundred elephants. — Strabo 15.2.9
From this, it seems that Seleucus surrendered the easternmost parts of the provinces of Arachosia, Gedrosia, Paropamisadae and perhaps also Aria. On the other hand, he was accepted by other satraps of the eastern provinces. His Persian wife, Apama, may have helped him implement his rule in Bactria and Sogdiana. This would tend to be corroborated archaeologically, as concrete indications of Mauryan influence, such as the inscriptions of the Edicts of Ashoka which are known to be located in, for example, Kandhahar in today&#x27;s southern Afghanistan.

Some authors say that the argument relating to Seleucus handing over more of what is now southern Afghanistan is an exaggeration originating in a statement by Pliny the Elder referring not specifically to the lands received by Chandragupta, but rather to the various opinions of geographers regarding the definition of the word &quot;India&quot;:
Most geographers, in fact, do not look upon India as bounded by the river Indus, but add to it the four satrapies of the Gedrose, the Arachotë, the Aria, and the Paropamisadë, the River Cophes thus forming the extreme boundary of India. According to other writers, however, all these territories, are reckoned as belonging to the country of the Aria. — Pliny, Natural History VI, 23
The span of control of the Mauryas is also questioned by present-day archaeologists, and the idea that the ceded territory included all of Aria and Gedrosia (Balochistan) seems unlikely.

The alliance between Chandragupta and Seleucus was affirmed with a marriage (Epigamia). Chandragupta or his son may have married a daughter of Seleucus, or perhaps there was diplomatic recognition of intermarriage between Indians and Greeks. An Indian Puranic source, the &quot;Pratisarga Parva&quot; of the &quot;Bhavishya Purana&quot;, described the marriage of Chandragupta with a Greek (&quot;Yavana&quot;) princess, daughter of Seleucus (&quot;Suluva&quot; in Indian sources).

In addition to this matrimonial recognition or alliance, Seleucus dispatched an ambassador, Megasthenes, to the Mauryan court at Pataliputra (Modern Patna in Bihar state). Only short extracts remain of Megasthenes&#x27; description of the journey.

The two rulers seem to have been on very good terms, as classical sources have recorded that following their treaty, Chandragupta sent various presents such as aphrodisiacs to Seleucus.

Seleucus obtained knowledge of most of northern India, as explained by Pliny the Elder through his numerous embassies to the Mauryan Empire:

The other parts of the country beyond the Hydaspes, the farthest extent of Alexander&#x27;s conquests were discovered and surveyed by Seleucus Nicator: namely

*from thence (the Hydaspes) to the Hesudrus 168 miles
*to the river Ioames (Yamuna) as much: and some copies add 5 miles more therto
*from thence to Ganges 112 miles
*to Rhodapha 119, and some say, that between them two it is no less than 325 miles.
*From it to Calinipaxa, a great town 167 miles-and-a-half, others say 265.
*And to the confluent of the rivers Iomanes and Ganges, where both meet together, 225 miles, and many put thereto 13 miles more
*from thence to the town Palibotta 425 miles
*and so to the mouth of the Ganges where he falleth into the sea 638 miles. — Pliny the Elder, Natural history, Book 6, Chap 21
Seleucus apparently minted coins during his stay in India, as several coins in his name are in the Indian standard and have been excavated in India. These coins describe him as &quot;Basileus&quot; (&quot;King&quot;), which implies a date later than 306 BC. Some of them also mention Seleucus in association with his son Antiochus as king, which would also imply a date as late as 293 BC. No Seleucid coins were struck in India thereafter and confirm the reversal of territory west of the Indus to Chandragupta.

Seleucus may have founded a navy in the Persian Gulf and in the Indian Ocean.

===Battle of Ipsus===
The war elephants Seleucus received from Chandragupta proved to be useful when the Diadochi finally decided to deal with Antigonus. Cassander, Seleucus and Lysimachus defeated Antigonus and Demetrius in the battle of Ipsus. Antigonus fell in battle, but Demetrius escaped. After the battle, Syria was placed under Seleucus&#x27; rule. He understood Syria to encompass the region from the Taurus mountains to Sinai, but Ptolemy had already conquered Palestine and Phoenicia. In 299 BC, Seleucus allied with Demetrius and married his daughter Stratonice. Stratonice was also the daughter of Antipater&#x27;s daughter Phila. Seleucus had a daughter by Stratonice, who was also called Phila.

The fleet of Demetrius destroyed Ptolemy&#x27;s fleet and thus Seleucus did not need to fight him.

Seleucus, however, did not manage to enlarge his kingdom to the west. The main reason was that he did not have enough Greek troops. During the battle of Ipsus, he had less infantry than Lysimachus. His strength was in his war elephants and in traditional Persian cavalry. In order to enlarge his army, Seleucus tried to attract colonists from mainland Greece by founding four new cities—Seleucia Pieria and Laodicea in Syria on the coast and Antioch on the Orontes and Apameia in the Orontes River valley. Antioch became his chief seat of government. The new Seleucia was supposed to become his new naval base and a gateway to the Mediterranean. Seleucus also founded six smaller cities.

It is said of Seleucus that &quot;few princes have ever lived with so great a passion for the building of cities. He is reputed to have built in all nine Seleucias, sixteen Antiochs, and six Laodiceas&quot;.

===Defeat of Demetrius and Lysimachus===

Seleucus nominated his son Antiochus I as his co-ruler and viceroy of the eastern provinces in 292 BC, the vast extent of the empire seeming to require a double government. In 294 BC Stratonice married her stepson Antiochus. Seleucus reportedly instigated the marriage after discovering that his son was in danger of dying of love sickness. Seleucus was thus able to get Stratonice out of the way, as her father Demetrius had now become king of Macedonia.

The alliance between Seleucus and Demetrius ended in 294 BC when Seleucus conquered Cilicia. Demetrius invaded and easily conquered Cilicia in 286 BC, which meant that Demetrius was now threatening the most important regions of Seleucus&#x27; empire in Syria. Demetrius&#x27; troops, however, were tired and had not received their payment. Seleucus, on the other hand, was known as a cunning and rich leader who had earned the adoration of his soldiers. Seleucus blocked the roads leading south from Cilicia and urged Demetrius&#x27; troops to join his side. Simultaneously he tried to evade battle with Demetrius. Finally, Seleucus addressed Demetrius personally. He showed himself in front of the soldiers and removed his helmet, revealing his identity. Demetrius&#x27; troops now started to abandon their leader &quot;en masse&quot;. Demetrius was finally imprisoned in Apameia and died a few years later in captivity.

Lysimachus and Ptolemy had supported Seleucus against Demetrius, but after the latter&#x27;s defeat the alliance started to break apart. Lysimachus ruled Macedonia, Thracia and Asia Minor. He also had problems with his family. Lysimachus executed his son Agathocles, whose wife Lysandra escaped to Babylon to Seleucus.

The unpopularity of Lysimachus after the murder of Agathocles gave Seleucus an opportunity to remove his last rival. His intervention in the west was solicited by Ptolemy Keraunos, who, on the accession to the Egyptian throne of his brother Ptolemy II (285 BC), had at first taken refuge with Lysimachus and then with Seleucus. Seleucus then invaded Asia Minor and defeated his rival in the Battle of Corupedium in Lydia, 281 BC. Lysimachus fell in battle. In addition, Ptolemy had died a few years earlier. Seleucus was thus now the only living contemporary of Alexander.

===Administration of Asia Minor===
Before his death, Seleucus tried to deal with the administration of Asia Minor. The region was ethnically diverse, consisting of Greek cities, a Persian aristocracy and indigenous peoples. Seleucus perhaps tried to defeat Cappadocia, but failed. Lysimachus&#x27; old officer Philetairos ruled Pergamon independently. On the other hand, based on their names, Seleucus apparently founded a number of new cities in Asia Minor.

Few of the letters Seleucus sent to different cities and temples still exist. All cities in Asia Minor sent embassies to their new ruler. It is reported that Seleucus complained about the number of letters he received and was forced to read. He was apparently a popular ruler. In Lemnos he was celebrated as a liberator and a temple was built to honour him. According to a local custom, Seleucus was always offered an extra cup of wine during dinner time. His title during this period was Seleucus &quot;Soter&quot; (&quot;saviour&quot;). When Seleucus left for Europe, the organizational rearrangement of Asia Minor had not been completed.

==Death and legacy==

Seleucus now held the whole of Alexander&#x27;s conquests except Egypt and moved to take possession of Macedonia and Thrace. He intended to leave Asia to Antiochus and content himself for the remainder of his days with the Macedonian kingdom in its old limits. He had, however, hardly crossed into the Thracian Chersonese when he was assassinated by Ptolemy Keraunos near Lysimachia in September 281 BC.

It appears certain that after taking Macedonia and Thracia, Seleucus would have tried to conquer Greece. He had already prepared this campaign using the numerous gifts presented to him. He was also nominated an honorary citizen of Athens.

Antiochus founded the cult of his father. A cult of personality formed around the later members of the Seleucid dynasty and Seleucus was later worshipped as a son of Zeus Nikator. One inscription found in Ilium (Troy) advises priests to sacrifice to Apollo, the ancestor of Antiochus&#x27; family. Several anecdotes of Seleucus&#x27; life became popular in the classical world.

Seleucus’ reputation as a founder of cities also seems to have persisted after his death. Excavations at the site of Dura-Europos in Syria, for instance, uncovered a cult relief from a temple showing Seleucus, as the founder of the city, crowning the Gad of Dura. Clearer evidence that the city considered Seleucus to be its founder come from a fragmentary papyrus document, P. Dura 32, which designates Dura-Europos as &quot;the colony of the Europeans of Seleucs Nicator&quot;. The sparse archaeological remains from the Hellenistic period of the site, however, indicate that the site began life as a small garrison settlement (a &quot;phourion&quot;) on royal land that did not yet have the status of a &quot;polis&quot;. The road system and fortifications only seem to have been constructed in 150 CE. The small community, living around the base of the citadel, with small plots of land for each soldier in the surrounding countryside, is unlikely to have had much royal attention in this early period, but the legend surrounding Seleucus I Nicator as a city founder seems to have led later inhabitants to attach his name to their settlement.

<text>Perdiccas (, &quot;Perdikkas&quot;; 355 BC – 321/320 BC) was a Macedonian general, successor of Alexander the Great, and regent of Alexander&#x27;s empire after his death. When Alexander was dying, he entrusted his signet ring to Perdiccas. Initially the most pre-eminent of the successors, Perdiccas effectively ruled Alexander&#x27;s increasingly unstable empire from Babylon for three years, until his assassination, as the kings he ruled for were incapable.

Perdiccas was born to Macedonian nobility. A supporter, (bodyguard) and (elite cavalry commander) of Alexander, he took part in Alexander&#x27;s campaign against the Achaemenid Persian Empire, distinguishing himself in Thebes and Gaugamela, and followed Alexander into India. When Alexander died in 323 BC, Perdiccas rose to become supreme commander of the imperial army, as well as regent for Alexander&#x27;s vast empire, ruling on behalf of Alexander&#x27;s intellectually disabled heir, King Philip III Arrhidaeus and his infant son, King Alexander IV of Macedon.

Perdiccas gained supreme power but also inherited the problems of Alexander&#x27;s quickly conquered and unstable empire. To consolidate power and retain authority, Perdiccas crushed numerous revolts, like that of Ariarathes, and assassinated rivals, like Meleager. Perdiccas&#x27; position as regent was never fully secure, however, and his authority was repeatedly contested by other generals. His attempt to marry Cleopatra of Macedon, Alexander&#x27;s sister, which would have given him claim to the Macedonian throne, angered critical generals—including Antipater, Craterus and Antigonus—who decided to revolt against the regent in the First War of the Diadochi. In response to this formidable coalition and a provocation from another general, Ptolemy, Perdiccas invaded Egypt, but his soldiers mutinied and killed him in 321/320 BC when the invasion foundered.

==Family background and early life==

According to the 2nd-century historian Arrian, Perdiccas was the son of the Macedonian nobleman, Orontes, a descendant of the independent princes of the Macedonian province of Orestis. While Perdiccas&#x27; actual date of birth is unknown, he would seem to have been of a similar age to Alexander. He had a brother called Alcetas and a sister, Atalante, who married Attalus. Perdiccas may have had, through some distant relation, blood of the Argead royal family.

Little is known of Perdiccas&#x27; youth, but he was probably brought to the Macedonian court in Pella to serve as page like many other young nobles alongside Alexander. When Pausanias assassinated King Philip II of Macedon in 336 BC, Alexander the Great&#x27;s father, Perdiccas was among those who chased the assassin down and killed him.

An anecdote reports that Perdiccas once went into the cave of a lioness who had recently gave birth, and stole two of its cubs. Another tells a story of his fondness for exercise, along with his fellow Orestian and successor, Craterus.

==Career under Alexander==

As the commander of a battalion of the Macedonian phalanx (heavy infantry), in 335 BC Perdiccas fought in the Balkan campaigns of Alexander against the Illyrian peoples located northwest of Macedon. In the same year, he distinguished himself during the conquest of Thebes, which had rebelled against Macedon following the death of Philip II. Perdiccas led a contingent which stormed the rear gate of the city, and was heavily wounded during the fighting.

Afterward, Perdiccas accompanied Alexander on his campaigns against the Achaemenid Persian Empire. Sources generally agree that Perdiccas was a loyal soldier of Alexander. For example, the ancient historian Plutarch reports the following conversation between the two prior to the Battle of Granicus (the first encounter between Alexander and the Persians), when Alexander was allotting out lands and properties to his followers:

Perdiccas led his battalion at the battles of Granicus, Issus, and Gaugamela, where he again distinguished himself and was wounded. Perdiccas became () of Alexander following this, and his influence probably grew steadily thereafter. Perdiccas&#x27; battalion was used by Alexander to flank and win the Battle of the Persian Gate in 330 BC. When Philotas, the son of Parmenion and an important general in Alexander&#x27;s army, was held in suspicion by the king, Perdiccas was among the close companions who joined Alexander in discussing what should be done. When Alexander attempted to kill another of his companions, Cleitus the Black, in 328 BC, Perdiccas was among those who held Alexander back.

Subsequently, he held an important command in the Indian campaigns of Alexander. Perdiccas and Hephaestion, Alexander&#x27;s closest companion, were generally compatible and seemed to have got along well, as both were selected to ford the Indus River (a task which required coordination) by Alexander and did so without issue. This contrasts Hephaestion&#x27;s known quarrels with other prominent generals of Alexander, such as Craterus and Eumenes of Cardia. Perdiccas was part of the cavalry under Alexander&#x27;s control at the Battle of the Hydaspes in 326 BC and crossed the river with him in said battle. Perdiccas later plundered around Sangala, and assaulted and sacked the Mallian towns. Alexander was wounded in this campaign, having been shot in the chest with an arrow that penetrated his armor; some traditions say Perdiccas was the one who cut the arrow out with a sword and saved the king&#x27;s life.

In 324 BC, at the nuptials celebrated at Susa, a prominent Persian city, Perdiccas married the daughter of the Persian satrap of Media, Atropates. Perdiccas&#x27; wife&#x27;s name is not known and he likely divorced her following Alexander&#x27;s death. When Hephaestion unexpectedly died the same year, Perdiccas was appointed his successor as commander of the Companion cavalry and chiliarch, effectively becoming Alexander&#x27;s second-in-command. He was also entrusted with the responsibility of transferring Hephaestion&#x27;s corpse to Babylon for burning and burial. As Alexander lay dying in his bed, he gave his signet ring to Perdiccas. Although Alexander&#x27;s intention with this action is not clear, it is probable that he wanted Perdiccas to reign as regent until his children came of age.

==Succession and crisis==

Following the death of Alexander the Great on 11 June 323 BC in Babylon, his generals met to discuss their next steps. Perdiccas was very influential at this point, as a close friend of Alexander, his second-in-command, and possessing the signet ring Alexander gave him.

=== Debate for leadership ===
The debate around who would succeed Alexander led to a divide in the Macedonian army; on one side were the aristocratic cavalry officers (generals), and on the other side the infantry soldiers. The infantry, also wanting to listen to the discussion, broke into the room where Perdiccas and the other generals were speaking.

Perdiccas, having placed the ring he received from Alexander on the throne, along with the royal robes and diadem, proposed that a final decision wait until Alexander&#x27;s wife Roxana, who was pregnant, had given birth; if the unborn child (the future Alexander IV of Macedon) was a boy, then Perdiccas proposed that the child be chosen as the new king. The Roman historian Quintus Curtius Rufus provides Perdiccas&#x27; apparent speech to the assembly:

This meant that Perdiccas would be the regent and effectively the ruler of Alexander&#x27;s empire until Roxana&#x27;s unborn child was old enough to rule. Though his later actions would show Perdiccas had ambitions to be king, during the assembly, when Aristonous, a fellow bodyguard, proclaimed Perdiccas should be made king and the suggestion was met with approval, Perdiccas hesitated to accept the position. Another of Alexander&#x27;s companions, Ptolemy, proposed a joint board of generals to rule the Empire, perhaps as a slight against Perdiccas as such a scheme would greatly decrease his current authority. Other proposals were considered, but despite misgivings amongst the other generals, most accepted Perdiccas&#x27; proposal of waiting until Roxana gave birth. The agreed upon interim arrangement was Perdiccas and Leonnatus overseeing Asia, and Craterus and Antipater ruling Macedonian-controlled Europe.

However, the infantry commander, Meleager, disagreed with Perdiccas&#x27; plans. Meleager argued in favour of Alexander&#x27;s intellectually disabled half brother, Philip III Arrhidaeus, whom he considered first in succession. The infantry supported this proposal with Meleager&#x27;s troops willing to fight in favour of Philip III, who they crowned. The infantry began to riot, and the generals united under Perdiccas&#x27; authority. After a brief scuffle, Perdiccas ordered a tactical retreat and the generals fled Babylon, but Perdiccas remained for a time hoping to regain the allegiance of the infantry. Meleager sent assassins to kill him. Despite only having page boys with him, Perdiccas met the assassins openly, and taunted and terrified them into fleeing.

=== Siege of Babylon ===
Perdiccas joined the generals outside of Babylon and put the city to siege, cutting off the supply lines. Meleager&#x27;s powerbase began to diminish, and he was eventually convinced by Eumenes of Cardia, Alexander&#x27;s former secretary, to reconcile with the generals, perhaps in collusion with Perdiccas. Perdiccas announced Philip III and the unborn child of Alexander&#x27;s wife Roxana (the future Alexander IV of Macedon) would be recognized as joint kings to placate Meleager. While the general Craterus was officially declared &quot;Guardian of the Royal Family&quot;, Perdiccas effectively held this position, as the joint kings were with him in Babylon. Antipater was confirmed as viceroy of Macedon and Greece. To formalize the reconciliation between the generals and infantry, Perdiccas announced a lustration (a religious purification ritual) and review of the army, convincing Meleager and the infantry to attend.

When the infantry accepted and marched outside Babylon, Perdiccas held a clear military advantage as he controlled all the cavalry and could threaten the infantry with a flanking maneuver. He then sent Philip III to order the capture the rebellious leaders of the infantry, except for Meleager. Perdiccas had these 300 men killed by trampling from his war elephants. Soon afterward, having cowed the infantry, Perdiccas had Meleager executed as well. Though successful in resecuring his power, the incident left the chiliarch and regent Perdiccas untrusting of the other generals, who were now also suspicious of him.

== Regent of Alexander&#x27;s empire ==
Through the Partition of Babylon in 323 BC, a compromise was reached under which Perdiccas was to serve as &quot;Regent of the Empire&quot; () for the disabled Philip III and infant Alexander IV, as well as supreme commander (&quot;&quot;) of the imperial army. Perdiccas soon showed himself intolerant of any rivals and, acting in the name of the two kings, sought to hold the empire together under his own hand. Perdiccas oversaw the distribution of satrapies to the other generals, sending away officers who threatened his authority. Perdiccas also attached Cleomenes of Naucratis to Ptolemy in Egypt as a lieutenant. Modern historians believe this was done to limit Ptolemy&#x27;s power and keep watch on his actions.

The men who remained at court with Perdiccas were probably those he could trust: his brother Alcetas, his brother-in-law Attalus, Seleucus, and Aristonous. Alexander the Great&#x27;s second wife, Stateira, was murdered by Perdiccas, possibly at the urging of Roxana. Perdiccas also procured Alexander&#x27;s &quot;Last Plans&quot; through the help of Eumenes, read the plans out before the army, and rejected them. This was done because not only were the plans extraordinarily expensive and grand (they included, for example, conquest of all of North Africa and the powerful Carthaginian Empire, along with the construction of a fleet of a thousand warships), but also because Perdiccas probably did not want to anger Antipater by replacing him with Craterus. Alexander&#x27;s wife Roxana gave birth (in the late summer or early fall of 323 BC) and Perdiccas took guardianship over Alexander IV.

=== Rebellions and refusals ===
As his authority was unstable, possibly as early as the Siege of Babylon Perdiccas had negotiated marriage with Nicaea of Macedon, the daughter of Antipater, to ally himself with the viceroy, acknowledging Antipater&#x27;s rule in Europe while improving his own position in Asia.

==== Bactrian Greek revolt ====
During the winter of 323 BC in the Upper Satrapies, specifically in Bactria (in modern-day Afghanistan), a rebellion had begun consisting of 23,000 Greek mercenaries who had heard of Alexander&#x27;s death and now wanted to return home. In response, Perdiccas tasked Peithon, another of Alexander&#x27;s and satrap of Media, with quelling it, and sent orders for the eastern satraps to contribute troops as well. Peithon marched east leading 3,800 men, with 10,000 to come from the eastern satraps. Although ancient sources suggest Peithon intended to recruit the Greeks and betray Perdiccas, modern historians dispute this. When the armies met, the Greeks surrendered and were partially slaughtered by Peithon&#x27;s army. Perdiccas&#x27; motive in this affair is not clear; some traditions say he gave the order for the massacre in order to ensure Peithon did not gain an army or to punish the rebels, while another hypothesis is that the slaughter of the Greeks may have occurred through the actions of Peithon and then, later, was blamed on Perdiccas.

==== Conquest of Cappadocia ====
Despite success in the east, Perdiccas&#x27; authority as regent was then challenged in the west. Here, Perdiccas had appointed Leonnatus, another , as satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia on the western coast of Asia Minor. At the Partition of Babylon, Perdiccas&#x27; supporter Eumenes was given the satrapies of Cappadocia and Paphlagonia, but both were unconquered. Perdiccas thus used his authority as regent of the joint kings to order Leonnatus and Antigonus (satrap of Phrygia, Pamphylia and Lycia) to aid Eumenes in securing his satrapy. Perdiccas probably gave Eumenes 5000 talents of gold for the reconquest of Cappadocia, allowing Eumenes to hire mercenaries.

Antigonus refused Perdiccas&#x27; order. Leonnatus accepted, mustering an army and marching to Cappadocia, arriving in the spring of 322 BC. Leonnatus, however, received a letter from Macedon from Cleopatra, Alexander the Great&#x27;s full sister, and Antipater, both asking him to come west – Cleopatra (probably influenced by her mother Olympias) offered herself as Leonnatus&#x27; bride (which would give Leonnatus claim to the Macedonian throne), while Antipater, who was besieged at Lamia as part of the Lamian War, asked Leonnatus for urgent assistance. Leonnatus told Eumenes of his plan to head west, attempting to convince him to join him; Eumenes refused and departed to Perdiccas&#x27; court, informing him of Leonnatus&#x27; intentions. For this information, Perdiccas elevated Eumenes to the ruling council of the Empire. This incident may have been what made Perdiccas &quot;regard Cleopatra as a means of gaining supreme power&quot;.

Upon learning of this, in the early summer of 322 BC Perdiccas marched the imperial army towards Asia Minor to reassert his dominance as regent, install Eumenes in Cappadocia, and confront Antigonus. It also allowed him to &quot;complete the conquest of Alexander&#x27;s empire&quot; as Alexander had ignored Cappadocia. In a single campaigning season, Perdiccas defeated Ariarathes I and his large army (30,000 infantry, 15,000 cavalry) in two decisive pitched battles, capturing more than 5,000 soldiers and killing 4,000 others, allowing his supporter Eumenes to claim his satrapy. This greatly contributed to Perdiccas&#x27; prestige; Perdiccas took Ariarathes captive, tortured and killed him, and apparently impaled most of his family. Perdiccas ordered Leonnatus to appear before him to stand trial for disobedience, but Leonnatus died during the Lamian War before the order reached him. At some time during the first year of his reign, Perdiccas crowned Alexander IV, Roxana and Alexander&#x27;s child, as king alongside Philip III.

==== Conquest of Pisidia, Isauria, Larandia ====

Having settled Cappadocia, Perdiccas planned to send Eumenes to subdue the Satrapy of Armenia, which was being mismanaged by Neoptolemus. He marched with Eumenes to Cilicia in the autumn of 322 BC and added the formidable Silver Shields to his army. Perdiccas then gave Eumenes his orders, and marched to Pisidia. The native Isaurians and Larandians living here had revolted, murdering Alexander&#x27;s satrap. Perdiccas campaigned against them next, easily conquering and destroying their cities in &quot;short and brutal struggles&quot;, acquiring great amounts of plunder and prestige; &quot;Victorious in the field ... Perdiccas now enjoyed his greatest success&quot;.

=== Marriage and war ===
To strengthen his control over the empire when his authority was weak, Perdiccas had agreed to marry Nicaea, the daughter of Antipater, the regent of Macedon. But now, in the winter of 322-321 BC, with his position greatly strengthened, Perdiccas was reconsidering the engagement. Furthermore, Olympias, mother of Alexander the Great, offered him the hand of Cleopatra of Macedon, who was residing at Sardis. Eumenes urged Perdiccas to marry Cleopatra, while Perdiccas&#x27; brother Alcetas advised marriage to Nicaea. Alcetas&#x27; faction believed that Perdiccas, in control of the royals, imperial army, and treasuries, could afford to wait for Antipater&#x27;s death (he was very old) instead of incurring his wrath; Eumenes&#x27; faction argued Perdiccas ought to begin to formally rule and that the dual kingship of Philip III and Alexander IV was a sham.

Rejecting Nicaea here would begin war with Antipater; as Perdiccas had yet to deal with Antigonus, he married Nicaea for the time being. During this winter, Antipater, having subdued Athens in the Lamian War, deferred the decision regarding the Samian exiles to Perdiccas; they were allowed to return to Samos on Perdiccas&#x27; order.

==== Bid for kingship ====
Perdiccas decided, however, that he wished to win the Macedonian throne, and had designed a plan for this; marriage to Cleopatra, and the return of Alexander&#x27;s body, son (Alexander IV), and brother (Philip III) to Macedonia with Olympias&#x27; approval which, combined, would have made him &quot;invincible&quot; and virtually guaranteed the kingship. Given the intellectual disability of Philip III and the limited acceptance of the infant, Alexander IV, due to his mother being a Persian, the marriage in particular would have given Perdiccas a claim as Alexander&#x27;s true successor as king, not merely as regent. Feeling &quot;full of confidence and well able to handle all his rivals,&quot; Perdiccas set about planning his march on Macedon.

At around the same time, Cynane, Alexander&#x27;s half-sister and widow of Amyntas IV, arranged for her daughter, Eurydice II, to marry the king, Philip III. Perdiccas, knowing this marriage would undermine his control over Philip III, sent an army under his brother Alcetas to order Cynane to return to Macedon. Cynane refused, and Alcetas&#x27; army killed her. Whether Perdiccas ordered this killing or not is debated, but it initiated a reversal of his ascendancy; &quot;His officers grew increasingly suspicious of his aspirations, the common soldier was alienated by his acts of barbarity&quot;. Perdiccas&#x27; army was furious at Cynane&#x27;s murder and effectively mutinied. This widespread discontent compelled Perdiccas to spare Eurydice II and marry her to Philip III after all, eroding his control over the royal family. Though Perdiccas was able to regain overall control, this incident probably demonstrated to him that &quot;the marriage to Cleopatra, despite the risks involved, was essential if the empire was to remain intact&quot;. Eumenes, accordingly, was sent by Perdiccas to Cleopatra with gifts to discuss marriage once again, and plans were set in place for the marriage to go forward.

Perdiccas had, in the meantime, ordered Antigonus to stand trial for insubordination (failing to help Eumenes in Cappadocia) and other charges. Antigonus was an entrenched and powerful satrap in Asia Minor; his refusal of Perdiccas&#x27; order undermined the authority of his government and Perdiccas wanted to rectify this. In response Antigonus, fearing confrontation with the regent, fled to Antipater&#x27;s court in Macedon, bringing news of not only Perdiccas&#x27; murder of Cynane, but his kingly aspirations and intention to marry Cleopatra instead of Nicaea. Craterus and Antipater, having subdued most of Greece in the Lamian War, were infuriated by Antigonus&#x27; news. They suspended their plans for more campaigns in Greece and prepared to march into Asia and depose Perdiccas.

== Civil war and invasion of Egypt==
=== Theft of the body of Alexander the Great ===
In late 321 and early 320 BC, as part of his kingly aspirations, Perdiccas intended to send Alexander&#x27;s body back to Aegae in Macedonia, the traditional place of burial for the Macedonian Argead Royal Family. The officer Arrhidaeus (not the king) was chosen to escort the body back to Macedonia, having constructed an elaborate funeral carriage. Perdiccas had informed Arrhidaeus of his plans, but Arrhidaeus began conveying Alexander&#x27;s body to Egypt instead of Macedon, and met no resistance as he did so. Ptolemy, who had already come to an understanding with Antipater and Craterus, had probably colluded with Arrhidaeus and Archon, satrap of Babylon in order to have Alexander&#x27;s body go to Egypt. Perdiccas, enraged by this news, sent an army to recover the body, but Ptolemy defeated this force and successfully brought Alexander&#x27;s remains back to Egypt, where they were housed in the city of Memphis.

Since the Partition of Babylon, Ptolemy had conquered Cyrenaica without Perdiccas&#x27; approval, and within a year of gaining his satrapy had unlawfully executed Cleomenes, the officer Perdiccas had attached to him. Perdiccas, who already distrusted Ptolemy, regarded his diverting of Alexander&#x27;s body as an unacceptable provocation, &quot;an act of war&quot;, and after convening his officers decided to invade Egypt.

=== Campaign against Ptolemy ===
Perdiccas&#x27; strategy was for his supporters to hold Asia Minor against Antipater and Craterus while he brought the royal army, and kings (Philip III and Alexander IV), south to eliminate Ptolemy. Perdiccas gave Eumenes of Cardia supreme command (as &quot;autokrator&quot;) to hold the Hellespont, and ordered Alcetas and Neoptolemus to obey Eumenes. Cleitus the White was ordered to aid Eumenes navally. Perdiccas probably expected to be able to defeat Ptolemy and then turn to combat Antipater and Craterus. Before Perdiccas left Pisidia, he attempted once more to entreat Cleopatra of Macedon to marry him, now needing the increased authority the marriage would bring, but she refused, not knowing who would win the war to come. Perdiccas marched to Cilicia first, deposing the satrap Philotas due to his friendship with Craterus, replacing him with one Philoxenus.

He prepared a fleet there while sending Docimus to Babylon to supplant the satrap Archon for collusion with Ptolemy. Perdiccas also prepared another fleet, led by Sosigenes of Rhodes and Aristonous, to conquer Cyprus and the Cypriot kings who had allied themselves to Ptolemy. As he was heading south, Perdiccas, having heard that Alcetas and Neoptolemus were refusing to work under Eumenes, ordered them once again to subordinate themselves to him. Finally, a third fleet led by Attalus, his brother-in-law, carried Perdiccas&#x27; sister Atalante and shadowed Perdiccas&#x27; army on their southward march. Docimus conquered Babylon and killed Archon in battle, while Perdiccas reached Damascus and deposed Laomedon, satrap of Syria for Ptolemaic sympathies. Soon after arriving in Egypt, Perdiccas may have heard of Eumenes&#x27; victory over Neoptolemus, who had defected to Antipater and Craterus. With this boost in morale, and when further reinforcements joined him, Perdiccas marched towards the Nile.

==== Fording of the Nile and the Camel&#x27;s Rampart ====

Ptolemy had been fortifying his satrapy for two years, believing war with Perdiccas was highly likely, and this greatly contributed to Perdiccas&#x27; difficulties and ultimate defeat. Perdiccas reached the most easterly tributary of the Nile near Pelusium, and discovered that the opposite side was garrisoned. He had his troops construct a dam, probably intending to lower the water levels to ease a crossing, but the force of the river broke it apart. It is possible that Perdiccas&#x27; invasion occurred while the Nile was flooding. In any case, the destruction of the dam led some officers in Perdiccas&#x27; camp to defect; Perdiccas, in response, successfully inspired his army with gifts and titles to continue the war effort.

Perdiccas then decamped, not informing his soldiers where he intended to march. He travelled swiftly upstream to find a suitable point to cross, soon coming across a ford which led to the cities of Tanis and Avaris on the other side of the Nile. However, a fort defended by a Ptolemaic force known as the &#x27;Camel&#x27;s Rampart&#x27; (&quot;Kamelon Teichos&quot;) inhibited his advance. Perdiccas then ordered his army to attack, leading a &quot;daring&quot; assault on the fortress at dawn. Perdiccas&#x27; deployed his war elephants first, then the hypaspists and Silver Shields, leading the cavalry in the rear in case Ptolemy arrived. When a large army under Ptolemy then arrived to reinforce the fort, denying Perdiccas an easy victory, Perdiccas, undaunted, renewed the assault. His infantry attempted to escalade the walls while his elephants destroyed Ptolemaic defenses. The fighting continued inconclusively for a considerable amount of time, with heavy losses for both sides, before Perdiccas finally broke off the siege and marched back to his camp.

That same night, Perdiccas broke camp again and marched to another ford, this one near Memphis. Here, Perdiccas placed his elephants upstream of this new crossing, so as to block the currents that would otherwise sweep away his men, and his cavalry downstream, to catch any unlucky enough to be swept away regardless of the elephants&#x27; makeshift dam.

For a time this &quot;clever&quot; strategy worked, enabling a sizeable contingent of Perdiccas&#x27;s army, led by Perdiccas himself, to cross the river and reach an island at its center. Many drowned in the attempt, however, and soon the elephants began to sink in the mud of the riverbed, and the currents rose quickly. This proved to be a disaster for Perdiccas, as he had to abandon the crossing, leaving many of his infantry stranded on the island. Perdiccas had no choice but to return with his men. Most of this contingent drowned trying to make it back to the eastern bank, many being eaten by crocodiles. Perdiccas&#x27; losses totaled 2,000, including prominent officers.

=== Assassination ===
Following what was so far a disastrous campaign, a mutiny broke out amongst Perdiccas&#x27; soldiers, who were disheartened by his failure to make progress in Egypt. Angry at his incompetence and probably colluding with Ptolemy, Perdiccas was murdered by his officers (Peithon, Antigenes, and Seleucus), probably in the summer of 320 BC, roughly three years after he had assumed the regency. His officers and the rest of his army defected to Ptolemy.

News of Eumenes&#x27; victory at the Battle of the Hellespont in 320 BC where Craterus and Neoptolemus were killed, which would have instantly restored Perdiccas&#x27; authority, arrived in Egypt one day after his assassination. Anson notes that &quot;if the news of Eumenes&#x27; victory over Craterus had arrived sooner, the entire history of the post-Alexander era might have been dramatically altered; Perdiccas might have emerged supreme, the successor of Alexander and the ruler of the vast Macedonian empire, with the inauguration of a new royal family&quot;. What became of Alexander&#x27;s signet ring that Perdiccas carried, and even whether he brought it into Egypt, is not known.

== Legacy ==

=== Character ===
The ancient accounts are largely negative toward Perdiccas, claiming that, though &quot;outstanding on the battlefield&quot;, he was arrogant, high-handed, and imperious. Diodorus Siculus calls him &quot;phonikos&quot; (φονικός), a &quot;man of slaughter&quot;. This may be due to the &quot;surpassing rivalry&quot; and enmity Perdiccas had with Ptolemy, whose now lost account served as the basis for the surviving sources (chiefly Arrian) we have for Perdiccas&#x27; career. The other characteristic regularly ascribed to Perdiccas by ancient sources is boldness.

Although Perdiccas was evidently a capable leader and effective soldier, a &quot;military man&quot;, he is seen to have lacked the qualities his position as regent required. His rule was authoritarian and abrasive, winning him little love from the rank and file, and his punishments were often brutal. Anson believes that Perdiccas &quot;was not a man to be crossed&quot; and that &quot;most acceded to his demands in his presence rather than incur his wrath&quot;. Conversely, Romm writes that &quot;When a leader has failed, the very qualities that made him a leader suddenly appear as flaws. Perdiccas&#x27; arrogance and bloody-mindedness were no more pronounced than Alexander&#x27;s ... but Alexander, unlike the hapless Perdiccas, knew little of failure&quot;.

=== Political legacy and motives ===
Perdiccas&#x27; death and the transferring of the regency to Antipater has been seen as marking the end &quot;for the empire as Alexander had envisioned it&quot;, as Perdiccas was not only quite close to Alexander but, like Alexander, had chosen to centre the empire at Babylon. Waterfield believes that since Perdiccas represented direct succession from Alexander himself, his assassination was a &quot;momentous step&quot;.

Perdiccas&#x27; motives are debated, though he is typically held to have acted from ambition. Some, such as Romm, believe he may have acted out of a desire to protect Alexander IV and maintain the unity of Alexander&#x27;s empire. Anson disbelieves this, citing Perdiccas&#x27; duplicitous communications with the Aetolian League against Antipater. Whether for ambition or loyalty, it is agreed that Perdiccas sought to &quot;hold Alexander&#x27;s legacy intact&quot;. Tarn writes that &quot;Perdiccas ... was a brave and good soldier; he was probably loyal to Alexander&#x27;s house, and meant to keep the empire together; but he saw that someone must exercise power, and he meant it to be himself&quot;. The regime that succeeded Perdiccas following the Partition of Triparadisus lasted only a few years, shorter than Perdiccas&#x27; regency.

Heckel&#x27;s view is that &quot;Perdiccas&#x27; career is an unfortunate tale of lofty ideals combined with excessive ambition and political myopia&quot;, but also that Perdiccas&#x27; attempts at keeping Alexander&#x27;s empire united are &quot;to be admired&quot; and &quot;suggests that he understood Alexander&#x27;s policies&quot;. In sum, that he was &quot;a great but flawed man, a victim of his own success and the envy of others&quot;.

<doc id="84562" wikidata="Q332358" url="?curid=84562" title="United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor">
<text>The United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET, ), was a United Nations mission in East Timor that aimed to solve the decades-long East Timorese crisis in the area occupied by Indonesian military. UNTAET provided an interim civil administration and a peacekeeping mission in the territory of East Timor, from its establishment on 25 October 1999, until its independence on 20 May 2002, following the outcome of the East Timor Special Autonomy Referendum. The transitional administration was established by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1272 in 1999.

A rarity for United Nations peacekeeping missions, UNTAET involved the United Nations directly administering the territory of East Timor. The mission&#x27;s responsibilities included providing a peacekeeping force to maintain security and order; facilitating and co-ordinating relief assistance to the East Timorese; facilitating emergency rehabilitation of physical infrastructure; administering East Timor and creating structures for sustainable governance and the rule of law; and assisting in the drafting of a new constitution and conducting elections.

UNTAET was established on 25 October 1999, the mission was led by Sérgio Vieira de Mello of Brazil (Special Representative of the Secretary-General for East Timor). The International Force East Timor
(INTERFET) transitioned to the UNTAET Peacekeeping Force (PKF) in February 2000 and was commanded by Filipino military officer Lieutenant General Jaime de los Santos (Force Commander UNTAET). UNTAET was abolished on 20 May 2002, with most functions passed to the East Timor government. The military and police forces were transferred to the newly created United Nations Mission of Support to East Timor (UNMISET).

UNTAET was wound up upon East Timorese independence but a United Nations presence in East Timor would continue through a newly established United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET).

==Contributing nations==

A coalition of nations sent troops to support the peace keeping mission. The forces were led by Australia, which provided the largest contingent and the out of theatre base for operations, supported by Portugal who sent the second largest contingent securing the key central areas of the country, followed by New Zealand, who took responsibility for the southern West sector with supporting troops from Ireland, Fiji, Nepal, and Singapore. France also sent special forces who joined the ANZACs on the first day, as well as contingents from Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Italy, Kenya, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. While the United States supported the transition authority, it did so mainly by underwriting contracts to replace destroyed infrastructure and thus avoided a direct military involvement, allowing the ANZAC led force to take the lead. The United States did, however, deploy a contingent of American police officers to serve with the International Police.

<text>A logistic function or logistic curve is a common S-shaped curve (sigmoid curve) with the equation

:formula_1

where


The logistic function has domain the real numbers, the limit as formula_2 is 0, and the limit as formula_3 is formula_4.

The standard logistic function, depicted at right, where formula_5, has the equation
:formula_6
and is sometimes simply called the sigmoid. It is also sometimes called the expit, being the inverse function of the logit. 

The logistic function finds applications in a range of fields, including biology (especially ecology), biomathematics, chemistry, demography, economics, geoscience, mathematical psychology, probability, sociology, political science, linguistics, statistics, and artificial neural networks. There are various generalizations, depending on the field.

== History ==
The logistic function was introduced in a series of three papers by Pierre François Verhulst between 1838 and 1847, who devised it as a model of population growth by adjusting the exponential growth model, under the guidance of Adolphe Quetelet. Verhulst first devised the function in the mid 1830s, publishing a brief note in 1838, then presented an expanded analysis and named the function in 1844 (published 1845); the third paper adjusted the correction term in his model of Belgian population growth.

The initial stage of growth is approximately exponential (geometric); then, as saturation begins, the growth slows to linear (arithmetic), and at maturity, growth approaches the limit with an exponentially decaying gap, like the initial stage in reverse.

Verhulst did not explain the choice of the term &quot;logistic&quot; (), but it is presumably in contrast to the &quot;logarithmic&quot; curve, and by analogy with arithmetic and geometric. His growth model is preceded by a discussion of arithmetic growth and geometric growth (whose curve he calls a logarithmic curve, instead of the modern term exponential curve), and thus &quot;logistic growth&quot; is presumably named by analogy, &quot;logistic&quot; being from , a traditional division of Greek mathematics. 

As a word derived from ancient Greek mathematical terms,
the name of this function is unrelated to the military and management term &quot;logistics&quot;, which is instead from &quot;lodgings&quot;, though some believe the Greek term also influenced &quot;logistics&quot;; see for details.

== Mathematical properties ==

The is the logistic function with parameters formula_7, formula_8, formula_9, which yields

formula_10

In practice, due to the nature of the exponential function formula_11, it is often sufficient to compute the standard logistic function for formula_12 over a small range of real numbers, such as a range contained in [−6, +6], as it quickly converges very close to its saturation values of 0 and 1.

===Symmetries===
The logistic function has the symmetry property that

formula_13

This reflects that the growth from 0 when formula_12 is small is symmetric with the decay of the gap to the limit (1) when formula_12 is large.

Further, formula_16 is an odd function.

The sum of the logistic function and its reflection about the vertical axis, formula_17, is

formula_18

The logistic function is thus rotationally symmetrical about the point (0, 1/2).

===Inverse function===
The logistic function is the inverse of the natural logit function

: formula_19
or
formula_20

This follows from
formula_21

The hyperbolic-tangent relationship leads to another form for the logistic function&#x27;s derivative:

formula_22

which ties the logistic function into the logistic distribution.

Geometrically, the hyperbolic tangent function is the hyperbolic angle on the unit hyperbola formula_23, which factors as formula_24, and thus has asymptotes the lines through the origin with slope and with slope , and vertex at corresponding to the range and midpoint () of tanh. Analogously, the logistic function can be viewed as the hyperbolic angle on the hyperbola formula_25, which factors as formula_26, and thus has asymptotes the lines through the origin with slope and with slope , and vertex at , corresponding to the range and midpoint () of the logistic function.

Parametrically, hyperbolic cosine and hyperbolic sine give coordinates on the unit hyperbola: formula_27, with quotient the hyperbolic tangent. Similarly, formula_28 parametrizes the hyperbola formula_25, with quotient the logistic function. These correspond to linear transformations (and rescaling the parametrization) of the hyperbola formula_30, with parametrization formula_31: the parametrization of the hyperbola for the logistic function corresponds to formula_32 and the linear transformation formula_33, while the parametrization of the unit hyperbola (for the hyperbolic tangent) corresponds to the linear transformation formula_34.

=== Derivative ===
The standard logistic function has an easily calculated derivative. The derivative is known as the density of the logistic distribution:

formula_35

formula_36from which all higher derivatives can be derived algebraically. For example, formula_37.

The logistic distribution is a location–scale family, which corresponds to parameters of the logistic function. If is fixed, then the midpoint is the location and the slope is the scale.

=== Integral ===
Conversely, its antiderivative can be computed by the substitution formula_38, since

formula_39

so (dropping the constant of integration)

formula_40

In artificial neural networks, this is known as the &quot;softplus&quot; function and (with scaling) is a smooth approximation of the ramp function, just as the logistic function (with scaling) is a smooth approximation of the Heaviside step function.

=== Logistic differential equation ===
The unique standard logistic function is the solution of the simple first-order non-linear ordinary differential equation

formula_41

with boundary condition formula_42. This equation is the continuous version of the logistic map. Note that the reciprocal logistic function is solution to a simple first-order &quot;linear&quot; ordinary differential equation.

The qualitative behavior is easily understood in terms of the phase line: the derivative is 0 when the function is 1; and the derivative is positive for formula_43 between 0 and 1, and negative for formula_43 above 1 or less than 0 (though negative populations do not generally accord with a physical model). This yields an unstable equilibrium at 0 and a stable equilibrium at 1, and thus for any function value greater than 0 and less than 1, it grows to 1.

The logistic equation is a special case of the Bernoulli differential equation and has the following solution:

formula_45

Choosing the constant of integration formula_46 gives the other well known form of the definition of the logistic curve:

formula_47

More quantitatively, as can be seen from the analytical solution, the logistic curve shows early exponential growth for negative argument, which reaches to linear growth of slope 1/4 for an argument near 0, then approaches 1 with an exponentially decaying gap.

The differential equation derived above is a special case of a general differential equation that only models the sigmoid function for formula_48. In many modeling applications, the more &quot;general form&quot; 
formula_49 
can be desirable. Its solution is the shifted and scaled sigmoid function formula_50.

==Probabilistic interpretation==
When the capacity formula_9, the value of the logistic function is in the range and can be interpreted as a probability . In more detail, can be interpreted as the probability of one of two alternatives (the parameter of a Bernoulli distribution); the two alternatives are complementary, so the probability of the other alternative is formula_52 and formula_53. The two alternatives are coded as 1 and 0, corresponding to the limiting values as formula_54.

In this interpretation the input is the log-odds for the first alternative (relative to the other alternative), measured in &quot;logistic units&quot; (or logits), is the odds for the first event (relative to the second), and, recalling that given odds of formula_55 for ( against ), the probability is the ratio of for over (for plus against), formula_56, we see that formula_57 is the probability of the first alternative. Conversely, is the log-odds &quot;against&quot; the second alternative, is the log-odds &quot;for&quot; the second alternative, formula_11 is the odds for the second alternative, and formula_59 is the probability of the second alternative.

This can be framed more symmetrically in terms of two inputs, and , which then generalizes naturally to more than two alternatives. Given two real number inputs, and , interpreted as logits, their &quot;difference&quot; formula_60 is the log-odds for option 1 (the log-odds &quot;against&quot; option 0), formula_61 is the odds,
formula_62 is the probability of option 1, and similarly formula_63 is the probability of option 0.

This form immediately generalizes to more alternatives as the softmax function, which is a vector-valued function whose -th coordinate is formula_64.

More subtly, the symmetric form emphasizes interpreting the input as formula_60 and thus &quot;relative&quot; to some reference point, implicitly to formula_8. Notably, the softmax function is invariant under adding a constant to all the logits formula_67, which corresponds to the difference formula_68 being the log-odds for option against option , but the individual logits formula_67 not being log-odds on their own. Often one of the options is used as a reference (&quot;pivot&quot;), and its value fixed as , so the other logits are interpreted as odds versus this reference. This is generally done with the first alternative, hence the choice of numbering: formula_8, and then formula_71 is the log-odds for option against option . Since formula_72, this yields the formula_73 term in many expressions for the logistic function and generalizations.

==Generalizations==
In growth modeling, numerous generalizations exist, including the generalized logistic curve, the Gompertz function, the cumulative distribution function of the shifted Gompertz distribution, and the hyperbolastic function of type I.

In statistics, where the logistic function is interpreted as the probability of one of two alternatives, the generalization to three or more alternatives is the softmax function, which is vector-valued, as it gives the probability of each alternative.

== Applications ==
=== In ecology: modeling population growth ===

A typical application of the logistic equation is a common model of population growth (see also population dynamics), originally due to Pierre-François Verhulst in 1838, where the rate of reproduction is proportional to both the existing population and the amount of available resources, all else being equal. The Verhulst equation was published after Verhulst had read Thomas Malthus&#x27; &quot;An Essay on the Principle of Population&quot;, which describes the Malthusian growth model of simple (unconstrained) exponential growth. Verhulst derived his logistic equation to describe the self-limiting growth of a biological population. The equation was rediscovered in 1911 by A. G. McKendrick for the growth of bacteria in broth and experimentally tested using a technique for nonlinear parameter estimation. The equation is also sometimes called the &quot;Verhulst-Pearl equation&quot; following its rediscovery in 1920 by Raymond Pearl (1879–1940) and Lowell Reed (1888–1966) of the Johns Hopkins University. Another scientist, Alfred J. Lotka derived the equation again in 1925, calling it the &quot;law of population growth&quot;.

Letting formula_74 represent population size (formula_75 is often used in ecology instead) and formula_76 represent time, this model is formalized by the differential equation:

formula_77

where the constant formula_78 defines the growth rate and formula_79 is the carrying capacity.

In the equation, the early, unimpeded growth rate is modeled by the first term formula_80. The value of the rate formula_78 represents the proportional increase of the population formula_74 in one unit of time. Later, as the population grows, the modulus of the second term (which multiplied out is formula_83) becomes almost as large as the first, as some members of the population formula_74 interfere with each other by competing for some critical resource, such as food or living space. This antagonistic effect is called the &quot;bottleneck&quot;, and is modeled by the value of the parameter formula_79. The competition diminishes the combined growth rate, until the value of formula_74 ceases to grow (this is called &quot;maturity&quot; of the population).
The solution to the equation (with formula_87 being the initial population) is

formula_88

where

formula_89

where formula_79 is the limiting value of formula_74, the highest value that the population can reach given infinite time (or come close to reaching in finite time). The carrying capacity is asymptotically reached independently of the initial value formula_92, and also in the case that formula_93.

In ecology, species are sometimes referred to as formula_78-strategist or formula_79-strategist depending upon the selective processes that have shaped their life history strategies.
Choosing the variable dimensions so that formula_96 measures the population in units of carrying capacity, and formula_97 measures time in units of formula_98, gives the dimensionless differential equation

formula_99

==== Integral ====
The antiderivative of the ecological form of the logistic function can be computed by the substitution formula_100, since formula_101

formula_102

==== Time-varying carrying capacity ====
Since the environmental conditions influence the carrying capacity, as a consequence it can be time-varying, with formula_103, leading to the following mathematical model:

formula_104

A particularly important case is that of carrying capacity that varies periodically with period formula_105:

formula_106

It can be shown that in such a case, independently from the initial value formula_92, formula_108 will tend to a unique periodic solution formula_109, whose period is formula_105.

A typical value of formula_105 is one year: In such case formula_112 may reflect periodical variations of weather conditions.

Another interesting generalization is to consider that the carrying capacity formula_112 is a function of the population at an earlier time, capturing a delay in the way population modifies its environment. This leads to a logistic delay equation, which has a very rich behavior, with bistability in some parameter range, as well as a monotonic decay to zero, smooth exponential growth, punctuated unlimited growth (i.e., multiple S-shapes), punctuated growth or alternation to a stationary level, oscillatory approach to a stationary level, sustainable oscillations, finite-time singularities as well as finite-time death.

=== In statistics and machine learning ===
Logistic functions are used in several roles in statistics. For example, they are the cumulative distribution function of the logistic family of distributions, and they are, a bit simplified, used to model the chance a chess player has to beat their opponent in the Elo rating system. More specific examples now follow.

==== Logistic regression ====
Logistic functions are used in logistic regression to model how the probability formula_114 of an event may be affected by one or more explanatory variables: an example would be to have the model

formula_115

where formula_12 is the explanatory variable, formula_117 and formula_118 are model parameters to be fitted, and formula_43 is the standard logistic function.

Logistic regression and other log-linear models are also commonly used in machine learning. A generalisation of the logistic function to multiple inputs is the softmax activation function, used in multinomial logistic regression.

Another application of the logistic function is in the Rasch model, used in item response theory. In particular, the Rasch model forms a basis for maximum likelihood estimation of the locations of objects or persons on a continuum, based on collections of categorical data, for example the abilities of persons on a continuum based on responses that have been categorized as correct and incorrect.

==== Neural networks ====
Logistic functions are often used in artificial neural networks to introduce nonlinearity in the model or to clamp signals to within a specified interval. A popular neural net element computes a linear combination of its input signals, and applies a bounded logistic function as the activation function to the result; this model can be seen as a &quot;smoothed&quot; variant of the classical threshold neuron.

A common choice for the activation or &quot;squashing&quot; functions, used to clip large magnitudes to keep the response of the neural network bounded, is

formula_120

which is a logistic function.

These relationships result in simplified implementations of artificial neural networks with artificial neurons. Practitioners caution that sigmoidal functions which are antisymmetric about the origin (e.g. the hyperbolic tangent) lead to faster convergence when training networks with backpropagation.

The logistic function is itself the derivative of another proposed activation function, the softplus.

=== In medicine: modeling of growth of tumors ===

Another application of logistic curve is in medicine, where the logistic differential equation can be used to model the growth of tumors. This application can be considered an extension of the above-mentioned use in the framework of ecology (see also the Generalized logistic curve, allowing for more parameters). Denoting with formula_121 the size of the tumor at time formula_76, its dynamics are governed by

formula_123

which is of the type

formula_124

where formula_125 is the proliferation rate of the tumor.

If a course of chemotherapy is started with a log-kill effect, the equation may be revised to be

formula_126

where formula_127 is the therapy-induced death rate. In the idealized case of very long therapy, formula_127 can be modeled as a periodic function (of period formula_105) or (in case of continuous infusion therapy) as a constant function, and one has that

formula_130

i.e. if the average therapy-induced death rate is greater than the baseline proliferation rate, then there is the eradication of the disease. Of course, this is an oversimplified model of both the growth and the therapy. For example, it does not take into account the evolution of clonal resistance, or the side-effects of the therapy on the patient. These factors can result in the eventual failure of chemotherapy, or its discontinuation.

=== In medicine: modeling of a pandemic ===

A novel infectious pathogen to which a population has no immunity will generally spread exponentially in the early stages, while the supply of susceptible individuals is plentiful. The SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 exhibited exponential growth early in the course of infection in several countries in early 2020. Factors including a lack of susceptible hosts (through the continued spread of infection until it passes the threshold for herd immunity) or reduction in the accessibility of potential hosts through physical distancing measures, may result in exponential-looking epidemic curves first linearizing (replicating the &quot;logarithmic&quot; to &quot;logistic&quot; transition first noted by Pierre-François Verhulst, as noted above) and then reaching a maximal limit.

A logistic function, or related functions (e.g. the Gompertz function) are usually used in a descriptive or phenomenological manner because they fit well not only to the early exponential rise, but to the eventual levelling off of the pandemic as the population develops a herd immunity. This is in contrast to actual models of pandemics which attempt to formulate a description based on the dynamics of the pandemic (e.g. contact rates, incubation times, social distancing, etc.). Some simple models have been developed, however, which yield a logistic solution.

==== Modeling early COVID-19 cases ====

A generalized logistic function, also called the Richards growth curve, has been applied to model the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak. The authors fit the generalized logistic function to the cumulative number of infected cases, here referred to as &quot;infection trajectory&quot;. There are different parameterizations of the generalized logistic function in the literature. One frequently used forms is

formula_131

where formula_132 are real numbers, and formula_133 is a positive real number. The flexibility of the curve formula_43 is due to the parameter formula_133: (i) if formula_136 then the curve reduces to the logistic function, and (ii) as formula_133 approaches zero, the curve converges to the Gompertz function. In epidemiological modeling, formula_138, formula_139, and formula_140 represent the final epidemic size, infection rate, and lag phase, respectively. See the right panel for an example infection trajectory when formula_141 is set to formula_142.

One of the benefits of using a growth function such as the generalized logistic function in epidemiological modeling is its relatively easy application to the multilevel model framework, where information from different geographic regions can be pooled together.

=== In chemistry: reaction models ===
The concentration of reactants and products in autocatalytic reactions follow the logistic function.
The degradation of Platinum group metal-free (PGM-free) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst in fuel cell cathodes follows the logistic decay function, suggesting an autocatalytic degradation mechanism.

=== In physics: Fermi–Dirac distribution ===
The logistic function determines the statistical distribution of fermions over the energy states of a system in thermal equilibrium. In particular, it is the distribution of the probabilities that each possible energy level is occupied by a fermion, according to Fermi–Dirac statistics.

=== In optics: mirage ===
The logistic function also finds applications in optics, particularly in modelling phenomena such as mirages. Under certain conditions, such as the presence of a temperature or concentration gradient due to diffusion and balancing with gravity, logistic curve behaviours can emerge.

A mirage, resulting from a temperature gradient that modifies the refractive index related to the density/concentration of the material over distance, can be modelled using a fluid with a refractive index gradient due to the concentration gradient. This mechanism can be equated to a limiting population growth model, where the concentrated region attempts to diffuse into the lower concentration region, while seeking equilibrium with gravity, thus yielding a logistic function curve.

=== In material science: Phase diagrams ===
See Diffusion bonding.

=== In linguistics: language change ===
In linguistics, the logistic function can be used to model language change: an innovation that is at first marginal begins to spread more quickly with time, and then more slowly as it becomes more universally adopted.

=== In agriculture: modeling crop response ===
The logistic S-curve can be used for modeling the crop response to changes in growth factors. There are two types of response functions: &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; growth curves. For example, the crop yield may &quot;increase&quot; with increasing value of the growth factor up to a certain level (positive function), or it may &quot;decrease&quot; with increasing growth factor values (negative function owing to a negative growth factor), which situation requires an &quot;inverted&quot; S-curve.
=== In economics and sociology: diffusion of innovations ===
The logistic function can be used to illustrate the progress of the diffusion of an innovation through its life cycle.

In &quot;The Laws of Imitation&quot; (1890), Gabriel Tarde describes the rise and spread of new ideas through imitative chains. In particular, Tarde identifies three main stages through which innovations spread: the first one corresponds to the difficult beginnings, during which the idea has to struggle within a hostile environment full of opposing habits and beliefs; the second one corresponds to the properly exponential take-off of the idea, with formula_143; finally, the third stage is logarithmic, with formula_144, and corresponds to the time when the impulse of the idea gradually slows down while, simultaneously new opponent ideas appear. The ensuing situation halts or stabilizes the progress of the innovation, which approaches an asymptote.

In a sovereign state, the subnational units (constituent states or cities) may use loans to finance their projects. However, this funding source is usually subject to strict legal rules as well as to economy scarcity constraints, especially the resources the banks can lend (due to their equity or Basel limits). These restrictions, which represent a saturation level, along with an exponential rush in an economic competition for money, create a public finance diffusion of credit pleas and the aggregate national response is a sigmoid curve.

Historically, when new products are introduced there is an intense amount of research and development which leads to dramatic improvements in quality and reductions in cost. This leads to a period of rapid industry growth. Some of the more famous examples are: railroads, incandescent light bulbs, electrification, cars and air travel. Eventually, dramatic improvement and cost reduction opportunities are exhausted, the product or process are in widespread use with few remaining potential new customers, and markets become saturated.

Logistic analysis was used in papers by several researchers at the International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA). These papers deal with the diffusion of various innovations, infrastructures and energy source substitutions and the role of work in the economy as well as with the long economic cycle. Long economic cycles were investigated by Robert Ayres (1989). Cesare Marchetti published on long economic cycles and on diffusion of innovations. Arnulf Grübler&#x27;s book (1990) gives a detailed account of the diffusion of infrastructures including canals, railroads, highways and airlines, showing that their diffusion followed logistic shaped curves.

Carlota Perez used a logistic curve to illustrate the long (Kondratiev) business cycle with the following labels: beginning of a technological era as &quot;irruption&quot;, the ascent as &quot;frenzy&quot;, the rapid build out as &quot;synergy&quot; and the completion as &quot;maturity&quot;.

=== Inflection Point Determination in Logistic Growth Regression ===
Logistic growth regressions carry significant uncertainty when data is available only up to around the inflection point of the growth process. Under these conditions, estimating the height at which the inflection point will occur may have uncertainties comparable to the carrying capacity (K) of the system.

A method to mitigate this uncertainty involves using the carrying capacity from a surrogate logistic growth process as a reference point. By incorporating this constraint, even if K is only an estimate within a factor of two, the regression is stabilized, which improves accuracy and reduces uncertainty in the prediction parameters. This approach can be applied in fields such as economics and biology, where analogous surrogate systems or populations are available to inform the analysis.

===Sequential analysis===
Link created an extension of Wald&#x27;s theory of sequential analysis to a distribution-free accumulation of random variables until either a positive or negative bound is first equaled or exceeded. Link derives the probability of first equaling or exceeding the positive boundary as formula_145, the logistic function. This is the first proof that the logistic function may have a stochastic process as its basis. Link provides a century of examples of &quot;logistic&quot; experimental results and a newly derived relation between this probability and the time of absorption at the boundaries.

<text>A killer application (often shortened to killer app) is any software that is so necessary or desirable that it proves the core value of some larger technology, such as its host computer hardware, video game console, software platform, or operating system. Consumers would buy the host platform just to access that application, possibly substantially increasing sales of its host platform.

==Examples==

Although the term was coined in the late 1980s one of the first retroactively recognized examples of a killer application is the VisiCalc spreadsheet, released in 1979 for the Apple II. Because it was not released for other computers for 12 months, people spent for the software first, then $2,000 to $10,000 (equivalent to $ to $) on the requisite Apple II. &quot;BYTE&quot; wrote in 1980, &quot;VisiCalc is the first program available on a microcomputer that has been responsible for sales of entire systems&quot;, and &quot;Creative Computing&quot;″s VisiCalc review is subtitled &quot;reason enough for owning a computer&quot;. Others also chose to develop software, such as EasyWriter, for the Apple II first because of its higher sales, helping Apple defeat rivals Commodore International and Tandy Corporation.

The co-creator of WordStar, Seymour Rubinstein, argued that the honor of the first killer app should go to that popular word processor, given that it came out a year before VisiCalc and that it gave a reason for people to buy a computer. However, whereas WordStar could be considered an incremental improvement (albeit a large one) over smart typewriters like the IBM Electronic Selectric Composer, VisiCalc, with its ability to instantly recalculate rows and columns, introduced an entirely new paradigm and capability.

Although released four years after VisiCalc, Lotus 1-2-3 also benefited sales of the IBM PC. Noting that computer purchasers did not want PC compatibility as much as compatibility with certain PC software, &quot;InfoWorld&quot; suggested &quot;let&#x27;s tell it like it is. Let&#x27;s not say &#x27;PC compatible&#x27;, or even &#x27;MS-DOS compatible&#x27;. Instead, let&#x27;s say &#x27;1-2-3 compatible&#x27;.&quot;

The UNIX Operating System became a killer application for the DEC PDP-11 and VAX-11 minicomputers during roughly 1975–1985. Many of the PDP-11 and VAX-11 processors never ran DEC&#x27;s operating systems (RSTS or VAX/VMS), but instead, they ran UNIX, which was first licensed in 1975. To get a virtual-memory UNIX (BSD 3.0), requires a VAX-11 computer. Many universities wanted a general-purpose timesharing system that would meet the needs of students and researchers. Early versions of UNIX included free compilers for C, Fortran, and Pascal, at a time when offering even one free compiler was unprecedented. From its inception, UNIX drives high-quality typesetting equipment and later PostScript printers using the nroff/troff typesetting language, and this was also unprecedented. UNIX is the first operating system offered in source-license form (a university license cost only $10,000, less than a PDP-11), allowing it to run on an unlimited number of machines, and allowing the machines to interface to any type of hardware because the UNIX I/O system is extensible.

==Usage==

The earliest recorded use of the term in print is in the May 24, 1988 issue of &quot;PC Week&quot;: &quot;Everybody has only one killer application. The secretary has a word processor. The manager has a spreadsheet.&quot;

The definition of &quot;killer app&quot; came up during the deposition of Bill Gates in the &quot;United States v. Microsoft Corp.&quot; antitrust case. He had written an email in which he described Internet Explorer as a killer app. In the questioning, he said that the term meant &quot;a popular application,&quot; and did not connote an application that would fuel sales of a larger product or one that would supplant its competition, as the Microsoft Computer Dictionary defined it.

Introducing the iPhone in 2007, Steve Jobs said that &quot;the killer app is making calls&quot;. Reviewing the iPhone&#x27;s first decade, David Pierce for &quot;Wired&quot; wrote that although Jobs prioritized a good experience making calls in the phone&#x27;s development, other features of the phone soon became more important, such as its data connectivity and ability to install third-party software (which was added later).

The World Wide Web (through the web browsers Mosaic and Netscape Navigator) is the killer app that popularized the Internet, as is the music sharing program Napster.

===Applications and operating systems===
* 1979: Apple II: VisiCalc (first spreadsheet program and killer app)
* 1979: TRS-80, CP/M systems: WordStar 1982: ported to CP/M-86 and IBM PC compatible/MS-DOS
* 1983: IBM PC compatible/MS-DOS: Lotus 1-2-3 (spreadsheet)
* 1985: Macintosh: Aldus (now Adobe) PageMaker (first desktop publishing program)
* 1985: AmigaOS: Deluxe Paint, Video Toaster, Prevue Guide
* 1993: Acorn Archimedes: Sibelius
* 1995: Windows 95

===Video games===
The term applies to video games that persuade consumers to buy a particular video game console or accessory, by virtue of platform exclusivity. Such a game is also called a &quot;system seller&quot;.

* &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, originally released for arcades in 1978, became a killer app when it was ported to the Atari VCS console in 1980, quadrupling sales of the three-year-old console.
* &quot;Star Raiders&quot;, released in 1980, was the first killer app computer game. &quot;BYTE&quot; named it the single most important reason for sales of Atari 400 and 800 computers. Another was &quot;Eastern Front (1941)&quot;, released in 1981.
* &quot;Dungeon_Master_(video_game)&quot;, released for the Atari ST 
* &quot;Defender of the Crown&quot;, released in 1986 for the Amiga as the first game from Cinemaware, has graphics which &quot;have set new standards for computer game&quot;.
* In 1996, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot; (1981) &quot;sent &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; fans scrambling to buy Apple IIs&quot;.
* The Famicom home port of &quot;Xevious&quot; is considered the console&#x27;s first killer app, which caused system sales to jump by nearly 2 million units.
* &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; stated that &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; on the Nintendo Entertainment System, &quot;Phantasy Star II&quot; on the Sega Genesis, and &quot;Far East of Eden&quot; for the NEC TurboGrafx-16 were killer apps for their consoles.
* The &quot;Super Mario&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, and &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series were killer apps for Nintendo&#x27;s Famicom and Super Famicom consoles in Japan.
* &quot;John Madden Football&quot;″s popularity in 1990 helped the Genesis gain market share against the Super NES in North America.
** &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, released in 1991, was hailed as a killer app as it revived sales of the three-year-old Genesis.
** &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; helped pushed the sales of the Genesis due to being uncensored unlike the Nintendo version.
** &quot;Streets of Rage&quot; became a system seller for the Mega Drive/Genesis in the UK.
* &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, originally released for arcades in 1991, became a system-seller for the Super NES when it was ported to the platform in 1992.
** &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; for the SNES helped Nintendo&#x27;s comeback against Sega.
* &quot;Myst&quot; and &quot;The 7th Guest&quot;, both released in 1993, drove adoption of CD-ROM drives for personal computers.

*&quot;Ridge Racer&quot;, &quot;Tekken&quot;, &quot;Wipeout&quot;, &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;, and &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; are the killer apps for the PlayStation. &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; was released for the Sega Saturn first and for MS-DOS at the same time, but the games contributed substantially to the original PlayStation&#x27;s early success. See &quot;Blache Fabian &amp; Lauren Fielder&quot; and &quot;NG Alphas&quot;.
**&quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; is another killer app for the PlayStation. &quot;Computing Japan&quot; magazine said that it was largely responsible for the PlayStation&#x27;s global installed base increasing 60% from units sold by November 1996 to units sold by May 1997.

<text>Marguerite Germaine Marie Donnadieu (, 4 April 1914 – 3 March 1996), known as Marguerite Duras (), was a French novelist, playwright, screenwriter, essayist, and experimental filmmaker. Her script for the film &quot;Hiroshima mon amour&quot; (1959) earned her a nomination for Best Original Screenplay at the Academy Awards.

==Early life and education==
Duras was born Marguerite Donnadieu on 4 April 1914, in Gia Định, Cochinchina, French Indochina (now Vietnam). Her parents, Marie (née Legrand, 1877–1956) and Henri Donnadieu (1872–1921), were teachers from France who likely had met at Gia Định High School. They both had previous marriages. Marguerite had two brothers: Pierre, the older, and the younger Paul.

Duras&#x27; father fell ill and he returned to France, where he died in 1921. Between 1922 and 1924, the family lived in France while her mother was on administrative leave. They then moved back to French Indochina when she was posted to Phnom Penh followed by Vĩnh Long and Sa Đéc. The family struggled financially, and her mother made a bad investment in an isolated property and area of rice farmland in Prey Nob, a story which was fictionalized in &quot;Un barrage contre le Pacifique&quot; (&quot;The Sea Wall&quot;).

In 1931, when she was 17, Duras and her family moved to France where she successfully passed the first part of the baccalaureate with the choice of Vietnamese as a foreign language, as she spoke it fluently. Duras returned to Saigon in late 1932 where her mother found a teaching post. There, Marguerite continued her education at the Lycée Chasseloup-Laubat and completed the second part of the baccalaureate, specializing in philosophy.

In autumn 1933, Duras moved to Paris, graduating with a degree in public law in 1936. At the same time, she took classes in mathematics. She continued her education, earning a &quot;diplôme d&#x27;études supérieures&quot; (DES) in public law and, later, in political economy. After finishing her studies in 1937, she found employment with the French government at the Ministry of the Colonies. In 1939, she married the writer Robert Antelme, whom she had met during her studies.

During World War II, from 1942 to 1944, Duras worked for the Vichy government in an office that allocated paper quotas to publishers and in the process operated a &quot;de facto&quot; book-censorship system. She also became an active member of the PCF (the French Communist Party) and a member of the French Resistance as a part of a small group that also included François Mitterrand, who later became President of France and remained a lifelong friend of hers. Duras&#x27; husband, Antelme, was deported to Buchenwald in 1944 for his involvement in the Resistance, and barely survived the experience (weighing on his release, according to Duras, just 38 kg, or 84 pounds). She nursed him back to health, but they divorced once he recovered.

In 1943, when publishing her first novel, she began to use the surname Duras, after the town that her father came from, Duras, Lot-et-Garonne.

In 1950, her mother returned to France from Indochina, wealthy from property investments and from the boarding school she had run.

==Career==
Duras was the author of many novels, plays, films, interviews, essays, and works of short fiction, including her best-selling, highly fictionalized autobiographical work &quot;L&#x27;Amant&quot; (1984), translated into English as &quot;The Lover&quot;, which describes her youthful affair with a Chinese-Vietnamese man. It won the Prix Goncourt in 1984. The story of her adolescence also appears in three other books: &quot;The Sea Wall&quot;, &quot;Eden Cinema&quot; and &quot;The North China Lover&quot;. A film version of &quot;The Lover&quot;, produced by Claude Berri and directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud, was released in 1992. Duras&#x27;s novel &quot;The Sea Wall&quot; was first adapted into the 1958 film &quot;This Angry Age&quot; by René Clément, and again in 2008 by Cambodian director Rithy Panh as &quot;The Sea Wall&quot;.

Other major works include &quot;Moderato Cantabile&quot; (1958), which was the basis of the 1960 film &quot;Seven Days... Seven Nights&quot;; &quot;Le Ravissement de Lol V. Stein&quot; (1964); and her play &quot;India Song&quot;, which Duras herself later directed as a film in 1975. She was also the screenwriter of the 1959 French film &quot;Hiroshima mon amour&quot;, which was directed by Alain Resnais. Duras&#x27;s early novels were fairly conventional in form, and were criticized for their &quot;romanticism&quot; by fellow writer Raymond Queneau; however, with &quot;Moderato Cantabile&quot;, she became more experimental, paring down her texts to give ever-increasing importance to what was not said. She was associated with the &quot;nouveau roman&quot; French literary movement, although she did not belong definitively to any one group. She was noted for her command of dialogue.

In 1971, Duras signed the Manifesto of the 343, thereby publicly announcing that she had had an abortion.

According to literature and film scholars Madeleine Cottenet-Hage and Robert P. Kolker, Duras&#x27; provocative cinema between 1973 and 1983 was concerned with a single &quot;ideal&quot; image, at the same time both &quot;an absolute vacant image and an absolute meaningful image,&quot; while also focused on the verbal text. They said her films purposely lacked realistic representation, such as divorcing image from sound and using space symbolically.

Many of her works, such as &quot;Le Ravissement de Lol V. Stein&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Homme assis dans le couloir&quot; (1980), deal with human sexuality.

Towards the end of her life, Duras published a short, 54-page autobiographical book as a goodbye to her readers and family. The last entry was written on 1 August 1995 and read &quot;I think it is all over. That my life is finished. I am no longer anything. I have become an appalling sight. I am falling apart. Come quickly. I no longer have a mouth, no longer a face&quot;. Duras died at her home in Paris on 3 March 1996, aged 81.

==Personal life==
During the later stages of World War II, she endured separation from her husband, Robert Antelme, following his imprisonment in Buchenwald. It was during his captivity that she wrote &quot;La Douleur&quot;. Believing that fidelity was an absurd notion, Duras began an affair with writer Dionys Mascolo while still married to Antelme, creating a &quot;ménage à trois&quot;. Mascolo later fathered her son, Jean Mascolo.

Duras had a wide circle of influential friends, ranging from writers and artists to intellectuals and even criminals. Her friend, the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, once remarked, &quot;Marguerite Duras turns out to know what I teach without me,&quot; in praise of her novel &quot;Le Ravissement de Lol V. Stein&quot;.

During the final two decades of her life, Duras experienced significant health problems. In 1980, she was hospitalized for the first time due to a combination of alcohol and tranquilizers. She also underwent detoxification to address her alcohol addiction. After being hospitalized again in October 1988, she fell into a coma that lasted until June 1989.

In parallel with her health issues during the 1980s, Duras began a relationship with Yann Andréa, a homosexual actor. Yann Andréa helped Duras through her health difficulties. Duras would detail these interactions and companionship in her final book, &quot;Yann Andréa Steiner&quot;.

Duras&#x27; health continued to decline in the 1990s. She died on 3 March 1996.

== Reception and legacy ==
Samuel Beckett regarded first hearing the radio play &quot;The Square&quot; as a significant moment in his life.

In 1992, following a dinner with friends where Duras was dismissed as the most overrated author of the time, journalist Étienne de Montety copied &quot;L&#x27;Après-midi de Monsieur Andesmas&quot;, one of Duras&#x27; lesser-known works from 1962. He made only minor changes, such as altering the names of the characters and renaming the title to &quot;Margot et l&#x27;important&quot;. He sent the result under the alias &quot;Guillaume P. Jacquet&quot; to the three main publishers of Duras: Gallimard, POL and Éditions de Minuit. Éditions de Minuit replied to Guillaume P. Jacquet that &quot;[his] manuscript unfortunately cannot be included in [their] publications&quot;; Gallimard that &quot;the verdict is not favourable&quot;; and POL that &quot;[the] book does not correspond to what [they] are looking for their collections&quot;. The facsimile of the refusal letters was published in the &quot;Figaro littéraire&quot; under the title &quot;Marguerite Duras refusée par ses propres éditeurs&quot; (&quot;Marguerite Duras refused by her own publishers&quot;).

The 2021 French mini-series &quot;Une affaire française&quot; (aka &quot;A French Case&quot;) depicts Duras (played by a chain-smoking Dominique Blanc) in a damning light, as she insinuates herself into the investigation of a 1984 child murder case by accusing the mother of the crime.

The account by Yann Andréa of his relationship with Duras was brought to the screen in a 2022 Claire Simon film entitled &quot;Vous ne désirez que moi&quot; (a phrase directed at Andréa by Duras) with Swann Arlaud as Andréa and Emmanuelle Devos as journalist Michèle Manceaux, subsequently issued on DVD by Blaq Out.

<text>John Newton Mitchell (September 5, 1913 – November 9, 1988) was the 67th Attorney General of the United States, serving under President Richard Nixon and was chairman of Nixon&#x27;s 1968 and 1972 presidential campaigns. Prior to that, he had been a municipal bond lawyer and one of Nixon&#x27;s associates. He was tried and convicted as a result of his involvement in the Watergate scandal.

After his tenure as U.S. Attorney General, he served as chairman of Nixon&#x27;s 1972 presidential campaign. Due to multiple crimes he committed in the Watergate affair, Mitchell was sentenced to prison in 1977 and served 19 months. As Attorney General, he was noted for personifying the &quot;law-and-order&quot; positions of the Nixon administration, amid several high-profile anti-Vietnam War demonstrations.

==Early life==
Mitchell was born in Detroit to Margaret (McMahon) and Joseph C. Mitchell. He grew up in the New York City borough of Queens. He attended Fordham University from 1932 to 1934, and earned his law degree from Fordham University School of Law in 1938. Mitchell carried out postgraduate study at St. John&#x27;s University Law School in 1938 and 1939.

During World War II, Mitchell served for three years in the United States Navy and attained the rank of lieutenant (junior grade) as a PT boat commander. Stories Mitchell told about his naval service were later debunked, including having received the Silver Star and Purple Heart, served as John F. Kennedy&#x27;s commanding officer, and saved the life of Pappy Boyington. Except for his period of military service, Mitchell practiced law in New York City from 1938 until 1969 with the firm of Rose, Guthrie, Alexander and Mitchell and earned a reputation as a successful municipal bond lawyer. Richard Nixon was a partner in the firm from 1963 to 1968.

Mitchell&#x27;s second wife, Martha Mitchell, became a controversial figure, gaining notoriety for her late-night phone calls to reporters in which she accused Nixon of participating in the Watergate cover-up and alleged that he and several of his aides were trying to make her husband the scapegoat for the whole affair.

==New York government==
Mitchell devised a type of revenue bond called a &quot;moral obligation bond&quot; while serving as bond counsel to New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller in the 1960s. In an effort to get around the voter approval process for increasing state and municipal borrower limits, Mitchell attached language to the offerings that was able to communicate the state&#x27;s intent to meet the bond payments while not placing it under a legal obligation to do so. Mitchell did not dispute when asked in an interview if the intent of such language was to create a &quot;form of political elitism that bypasses the voter&#x27;s right to a referendum or an initiative.&quot;

==Political career==
 In 1967, the firm of Caldwell, Trimble &amp; Mitchell, where Mitchell was lead partner, merged with Richard Nixon&#x27;s firm, Nixon, Mudge, Rose, Guthrie, &amp; Alexander. Nixon was then officially in &quot;political retirement&quot; but was quietly organizing a return to politics in the 1968 Presidential Election. Mitchell, with his many contacts in local government, became an important strategic confidant to Nixon, who referred to him as &quot;the heavyweight.&quot;

===Nixon campaign manager===
In 1968 John Mitchell agreed to become Nixon&#x27;s presidential campaign manager. During his successful 1968 campaign, Nixon turned over the details of the day-to-day operations to Mitchell.

===Vietnam===
Allegedly, Mitchell also played a central role in covert attempts to sabotage the 1968 Paris Peace Accords which could have ended the Vietnam War (the “Chennault Affair”).

===Attorney general===

After Nixon became president in January 1969, he appointed Mitchell as Attorney General of the United States while making an unprecedented direct appeal to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover that the usual background investigation not be conducted. Mitchell remained in office from 1969 until he resigned in 1972 to manage Nixon&#x27;s reelection campaign.

===Law and order===
Mitchell believed that the government&#x27;s need for &quot;law and order&quot; justified restrictions on civil liberties. He advocated the use of wiretaps in national security cases without obtaining a court order (&quot;United States v. U.S. District Court&quot;) and the right of police to employ the preventive detention of criminal suspects. He brought conspiracy charges against critics of the Vietnam War, likening them to brown shirts of the Nazi era in Germany.

Mitchell expressed a reluctance to involve the Justice Department in some civil rights issues. &quot;The Department of Justice is a law enforcement agency,&quot; he told reporters. &quot;It is not the place to carry on a program aimed at curing the ills of society.&quot; However, he also told activists, &quot;You will be better advised to watch what we do, not what we say.&quot;

===School desegregation===
Near the beginning of his administration, Nixon ordered Mitchell to go slow on desegregation of schools in the South, in fulfillment of Nixon&#x27;s &quot;Southern Strategy&quot; which accused him of focusing on gaining support from Southern white voters. After being instructed by the federal courts that segregation was unconstitutional and that the executive branch was required to enforce the rulings of the courts, Mitchell began to comply, threatening to withhold federal funds from those school systems that were still segregated and threatening legal action against them.

School segregation had been struck down as unconstitutional by a unanimous Supreme Court decision in 1954 (&quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;), but in 1955, the Court ruled that desegregation needed to be accomplished only with &quot;all deliberate speed,&quot; which many Southern states interpreted as an invitation to delay. It was not until 1969 that the Supreme Court renounced the &quot;all deliberate speed&quot; rule and declared that further delay in accomplishing desegregation was no longer permissible. As a result, some 70% of black children were still attending segregated schools in 1968 when Nixon became president. By 1972, as a result of President Nixon&#x27;s policy this percentage had decreased to 8%, a greater decrease than in any of the previous three presidents. Enrollment of black children in desegregated schools rose from 186,000 in 1969 to 3 million in 1970.

===Public safety===
From the outset, Mitchell strove to suppress what many Americans saw as major threats to their safety: urban crime, black unrest, and war resistance. He called for the use of &quot;no-knock&quot; warrants for police to enter homes, frisking suspects without a warrant, wiretapping, preventive detention, the use of federal troops to repress crime in the capital, a restructured Supreme Court, and a slowdown in school desegregation. &quot;This country is going so far to the right you won&#x27;t recognize it,&quot; he told a reporter.

There had been national outrage over the 1969 burning Cuyahoga River. President Nixon had signed the National Environmental Policy Act on New Year&#x27;s Day in 1970, establishing the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Nixon appointed William Ruckelshaus to head the agency, which opened its doors December 2, 1970. Mitchell gave a Press Conference December 18, 1970: “I would like to call attention to an area of activity that we have not publicly emphasized lately, but which I feel, because of the changing events, deserves your attention. I refer to the pollution control litigation, with particular reference to our work with the new Environmental Protection Agency, now headed by William Ruckelshaus.  As in the case of other government departments and agencies, EPA refers civil and criminal suits to the Department of Justice, which determines whether there is a base for prosecution and of course, if we find it so, we proceed with court action... And today, I would like to announce that we are filing suit this morning against the Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation for discharging substantial quantities of cyanide into the Cuyahoga River near Cleveland. Mr. Ruckelshaus has said, when he asked the Department to file this suit, that the 180-day notice filed against the company had expired. We are filing a civil suit to seek immediate injunctive relief under the Refuse Act of 1899 and the Federal Water Pollution Act to halt the discharge of these deleterious materials into the river.”

===Dirty tricks===
In an early sample of the &quot;dirty tricks&quot; that would later mark the 1971–72 campaign, Mitchell approved a $10,000 subsidy to employ an American Nazi Party faction in a bizarre effort to get Alabama Governor George Wallace off the ballots in California. The scheme failed.

==Vesco donation obstruction trial==
John Mitchell&#x27;s name was mentioned in a deposition concerning Robert L. Vesco, an international financier who was a fugitive from a federal indictment. Mitchell and Nixon Finance Committee Chairman Maurice H. Stans were indicted in May 1973 on federal charges of obstructing an investigation of Vesco after he made a $200,000 contribution to the Nixon campaign. In April 1974, both men were acquitted in a New York federal district court.

==Watergate scandal==

In the days immediately after the Watergate break-in of June 17, 1972, Mitchell enlisted former FBI agent Steve King to prevent his wife Martha from learning about the break-in or contacting reporters. While she was on a phone call with journalist Helen Thomas about the break-in, King pulled the phone cord from the wall. Mrs. Mitchell was held against her will in a California hotel room and forcibly sedated by a psychiatrist after a physical struggle with five men that left her needing stitches. Nixon aides, in an effort to discredit her, told the press that she had a &quot;drinking problem&quot;. Nixon was later to tell interviewer David Frost in 1977 that Martha was a distraction to John Mitchell, such that no one was minding the store, and &quot;If it hadn&#x27;t been for Martha Mitchell, there&#x27;d have been no Watergate.&quot;

In 1972, when asked to comment about a forthcoming article that reported that he controlled a political slush fund used for gathering intelligence on the Democrats, he famously uttered an implied threat to reporter Carl Bernstein: &quot;Katie Graham&#x27;s gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that&#x27;s published.&quot;
In July 1973, Mitchell testified before the Senate Watergate Committee where he claimed he had no prior knowledge of the Watergate break-in, which contradicted the testimony of others who appeared before the committee. He admitted that he was briefed on January 27, 1972, while he was the attorney general, by G. Gordon Liddy on Operation Gemstone which proposed numerous illegal activities to support the reelection of President Nixon, including the use of prostitutes, kidnapping, and assaulting antiwar protestors. Mitchell testified he should have thrown Liddy &quot;out of the window&quot;. Jeb Stuart Magruder and John Dean testified to the committee that Mitchell later approved electronic surveillance (i.e., bugging telephones) but did not approve of the other proposed activities.

Tape recordings made by President Nixon and the testimony of others involved confirmed that Mitchell had participated in meetings to plan the break-in of the Democratic Party&#x27;s national headquarters in the Watergate Office Building. In addition, he had met with the president on at least three occasions to cover up White House involvement, using illegal means such as witness tampering, after the burglars were discovered and arrested.

On January 1, 1975, Mitchell, who was represented by the criminal defense attorney William G. Hundley, was found guilty of conspiracy, obstruction of justice, and perjury. Mitchell was sentenced on February 21 to two-and-a-half to eight years in prison for his role in the Watergate break-in and cover-up, which he dubbed the &quot;White House horrors&quot;. As a result of the conviction, Mitchell was disbarred from the practice of law in New York. The sentence was later reduced to one-to-four years by United States District Court Judge John J. Sirica. Mitchell served 19 months of his sentence at Federal Prison Camp, Montgomery (in Maxwell Air Force Base) in Montgomery, Alabama, a minimum-security prison, before being released on parole for medical reasons.

==Death==
Around 5:00 pm on November 9, 1988, Mitchell collapsed from a heart attack on the sidewalk in front of 2812 N Street NW in the Georgetown area of Washington, D.C., and died that evening at George Washington University Hospital. He was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery. He was eligible for the honor because of his World War II Naval service and having held the cabinet post of Attorney General.

<text>Arrigo Boito (; born Enrico Giuseppe Giovanni Boito; 24 February 1842 10 June 1918) was an Italian librettist, composer, poet and critic whose only completed opera was &quot;Mefistofele&quot;. Among the operas for which he wrote the libretti are Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s monumental last two operas &quot;Otello&quot; and &quot;Falstaff&quot; as well as Amilcare Ponchielli&#x27;s &quot;La Gioconda&quot;.

Along with Emilio Praga and his brother Camillo Boito, he is regarded as one of the prominent representatives of the Scapigliatura (Italian bohemian) artistic movement. He wrote essays under the anagrammatic pseudonym of Tobia Gorrio.

==Biography==
Boito was born in Padua. He was the son of Silvestro Boito, a painter of miniatures, who was not of noble birth but passed himself off as a nobleman, and his wife, a Polish countess, Józefina Radolińska. His older brother, Camillo Boito, was an Italian architect and engineer as well as a noted art critic, art historian and novelist.

Boito studied music at the Milan Conservatory with Alberto Mazzucato until 1861, where he was a contemporary of Albert Visetti and Amintore Galli. In 1866, with Galli, Franco Faccio, and Emilio Praga, Boito fought under Giuseppe Garibaldi in the Seven Weeks&#x27; War in which the Kingdom of Italy and Prussia fought against Austria, after which Venice was ceded to Italy.

Between 1887 and 1894, he had an affair with the celebrated actress Eleonora Duse. Their relationship was carried out in a highly clandestine manner, presumably because of Boito&#x27;s many aristocratic friends and acquaintances. Despite this, their voluminous correspondence over the years survives. The two remained on good terms until his death.

Towards the end of his musical career, Boito succeeded Giovanni Bottesini as director of the Parma Conservatory after the latter&#x27;s death in 1889 and held the post until 1897. He received the honorary degree of Doctor of Music from the University of Cambridge in 1893, and on his death in Milan, he was interred there in the Cimitero Monumentale. He was an atheist.

A memorial concert was given in his honour at La Scala in 1948. The orchestra was conducted by Arturo Toscanini. Recorded in very primitive sound, the concert has been issued on CD.

==Career in music==
Boito wrote very little music, but completed (and later destroyed) the opera &quot;Ero e Leandro&quot; and left incomplete a further opera, &quot;Nerone&quot;, which he had been working at, on and off, between 1877 and 1915. Excluding its last act, for which Boito left only a few sketches, &quot;Nerone&quot; was finished after his death by Arturo Toscanini and Vincenzo Tommasini and premiered at La Scala in 1924. He also left a Symphony in A minor in manuscript.

Mefistofele

His only completed opera, &quot;Mefistofele&quot;, based on Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;, was given its first performance on 5 March 1868, at La Scala, Milan. The premiere, which he conducted himself, was badly received, provoking riots and duels over its supposed &quot;Wagnerism&quot;, and it was closed by the police after two performances. Verdi commented, &quot;He aspires to originality but succeeds only at being strange.&quot; Boito withdrew the opera from further performances to rework it, and it had a more successful second premiere, in Bologna on 10 April 1875. This revised and drastically cut version also changed Faust from a baritone to a tenor. &quot;Mefistofele&quot; is the only work of his performed with any regularity today, and Enrico Caruso included its two tenor arias in his first recording session. The prologue to the opera, set in Heaven, is a favourite concert excerpt.

Libretti

Boito&#x27;s literary powers never waned. As well as writing the libretti for his own operas, he wrote them for greater operas by two other composers. As &quot;Tobia Gorrio&quot; (an anagram of his name), he provided the libretto for Amilcare Ponchielli&#x27;s &quot;La Gioconda&quot;.

Collaboration with Verdi

Shortly after he had collaborated with Verdi on &quot;Inno delle nazioni&quot; (&quot;Anthem of the Nations&quot;, London, 1862), Boito offended him in a toast to his long-time friend, the composer (and later conductor) Franco Faccio. The &quot;rapprochement&quot; was effected by the music publisher Giulio Ricordi, whose long-term aim was to persuade Verdi to write another opera. Verdi agreed that Boito should revise the libretto of the original 1857 &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot;. Musicologist Roger Parker speculates that this was based on a desire to &quot;test the possibility&quot; of working with Boito, before possibly embarking on a larger project. The revised &quot;Boccanegra&quot; premiered to great acclaim in 1881. With that, their mutual friendship and respect blossomed, and that larger project became &quot;Otello&quot;. Although Verdi&#x27;s aim to write the music for an opera based on Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot; never came to fruition (despite the existence of a libretto), Boito provided subtle and resonant libretti not just for &quot;Otello&quot; (based on Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Othello&quot;) but also for &quot;Falstaff&quot; (which was based on two other Shakespeare plays, &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; and parts of &quot;Henry IV&quot;). After those many years of close association, when Verdi died in 1901, Boito was at his bedside.

==Libretti by Boito==
The years given are those of the premieres. Boito also provided the text to Verdi&#x27;s cantata &quot;Inno delle Nazioni&quot; which was first given on 24 May 1862 at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, London.

==Recordings==
Recordings of two operas exist:
* &quot;Mefistofele&quot;
* &quot;Nerone&quot;

==Depictions in media==
* The play &quot;After Aida&quot; — a 1985 play-with-music by Julian Mitchell — depicts the struggle of Giulio Ricordi and Franco Faccio to get the retired Verdi to collaborate with young Boito on a project, which resulted in &quot;Otello&quot;.
* In November 2001, &quot;Tell Giulio the Chocolate is Ready&quot;, a radio play by Murray Dahm, was produced and broadcast by Radio New Zealand. The play is based on the letters of the Verdi-Boito correspondence and explores the genesis and production of Verdi and Boito&#x27;s opera &quot;Otello&quot;. The play and broadcast included those sections of the opera as they appeared in the correspondence (such as Iago&#x27;s &quot;Credo&quot;).

<text>Louis Ferdinand Auguste Destouches (27 May 1894 – 1 July 1961), better known by the pen name Louis-Ferdinand Céline ( ; ), was a French novelist, polemicist, and physician. His first novel &quot;Journey to the End of the Night&quot; (1932) won the &quot;Prix Renaudot&quot; but divided critics due to the author&#x27;s pessimistic depiction of the human condition and his writing style based on working-class speech. In subsequent novels such as &quot;Death on the Installment Plan&quot; (1936), &quot;Guignol&#x27;s Band&quot; (1944) and &quot;Castle to Castle&quot; (1957), Céline further developed an innovative and distinctive literary style. Maurice Nadeau wrote: &quot;What Joyce did for the English language...what the surrealists attempted to do for the French language, Céline achieved effortlessly and on a vast scale.&quot;

From 1937 Céline wrote a series of antisemitic polemical works in which he advocated a military alliance with Nazi Germany. He continued to publicly espouse antisemitic views during the German occupation of France, and after the Allied landing in Normandy in 1944, he fled to Germany and then Denmark where he lived in exile. He was convicted of collaboration by a French court in 1951 but was pardoned by a military tribunal soon after. He returned to France where he resumed his careers as a doctor and author.

Céline is widely considered to be one of the greatest French novelists of the 20th century and his novels have had an enduring influence on later authors. However, he remains a controversial figure in France due to his antisemitism and activities during the Second World War.

==Biography==

===Early life===
The only child of Fernand Destouches and Marguerite-Louise-Céline Guilloux, he was born Louis Ferdinand Auguste Destouches in 1894 at Courbevoie, just outside Paris in the Seine &quot;département&quot; (now Hauts-de-Seine). The family came originally from Normandy on his father&#x27;s side and Brittany on his mother&#x27;s side. His father was a middle manager in an insurance company and his mother owned a boutique where she sold antique lace. In 1905, he was awarded his &quot;Certificat d&#x27;études&quot;, after which he worked as an apprentice and messenger boy in various trades.

Between 1908 and 1910, his parents sent him to Germany and England for a year in each country in order to acquire foreign languages for future employment. From the time he left school until the age of eighteen Céline worked in various jobs, leaving or losing them after only short periods of time. He worked for silk sellers and jewellers, first, at eleven, as an errand boy, and later as a salesperson for a local goldsmith. Although he was no longer being formally educated, he bought schoolbooks with the money he earned, and studied by himself. It was around this time that Céline vaguely thought of becoming a doctor.

===World War I and Africa===
In 1912, Céline volunteered for the French army (in what he described as an act of rebellion against his parents) and began a three-year enlistment in the 12th Cuirassier Regiment stationed in Rambouillet. At first he was unhappy with military life, and considered deserting. However, he adapted, and eventually attained the rank of sergeant. The beginning of the First World War brought action to Céline&#x27;s unit. On 25 October 1914, he volunteered to deliver a message, when others were reluctant to do so because of heavy German fire. Near Ypres, during his attempt to deliver the message, he was wounded in his right arm. (Although he was not wounded in the head, as he later claimed, he did suffer severe headaches and tinnitus for the rest of his life.) For his bravery, he was awarded the &quot;médaille militaire&quot; in November, and appeared one year later in the weekly &quot;l&#x27;Illustré National&quot; (November 1915). He later wrote that his wartime experience left him with &quot;a profound disgust for all that is bellicose.&quot;

In March 1915, he was sent to London to work in the French passport office. He spent his nights visiting music halls and the haunts of the London underworld, and claimed to have met Mata Hari. He later drew on his experiences in the city for his novel &quot;Guignol&#x27;s Band&quot; (1944). In September, he was declared unfit for military duty and was discharged from the army. Before returning to France, he married Suzanne Nebout, a French dancer, but the marriage wasn&#x27;t registered with the French Consulate and they soon separated.

In 1916, Céline went to French-administered Cameroon as an employee of the Forestry Company of Sangha-Oubangui. He worked as an overseer on a plantation and a trading post, and ran a pharmacy for the local inhabitants, procuring essential medical supplies from his parents in France. He left Africa in April 1917 due to ill health. His experiences in Africa left him with a distaste for colonialism and an increasing passion for medicine as a vocation.

===Becoming a doctor (1918–1924)===
In March 1918, Céline was employed by the Rockefeller Foundation as part of a team travelling around Brittany delivering information sessions on tuberculosis and hygiene. He met Dr Athanase Follet of the Medical Faculty of the University of Rennes, and soon became close to Follet&#x27;s daughter Édith. Dr Follet encouraged him to pursue medicine and Céline studied for his baccalaureate part-time, passing his examinations in July 1919. He married Édith in August.

Céline enrolled in the Medical Faculty at Rennes in April 1920 and in June Édith gave birth to a daughter, Collette Destouches. In 1923 he transferred to the University of Paris and in May 1924 defended his dissertation &quot;The Life and Work of Philippe-Ignace Semmelweis&quot; &quot;(1818–1865)&quot;, which has been called, &quot;a Célinian novel in miniature&quot;.

===League of Nations and medical practice (1924–1931)===

In June 1924 Céline joined the Health Department of the League of Nations in Geneva, leaving his wife and daughter in Rennes. His duties involved extensive travel in Europe and to Africa, Canada, the United States and Cuba. He drew on his time with the League for his play &quot;L&#x27;Église (The Church&quot;, written in 1927, but first published in 1933).

Édith divorced him in June 1926 and a few months later he met Elizabeth Craig, an American dancer studying in Geneva. They were to remain together for the six years in which he established himself as a major author. He later wrote: &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t have amounted to anything without her.&quot;

He left the League of Nations in late 1927 and set up a medical practice in the working-class Paris suburb of Clichy. The practice wasn&#x27;t profitable and he supplemented his income working for the nearby public clinic and a pharmaceutical company. In 1929 he gave up his private practice and moved to Montmartre with Elizabeth. However, he continued to practice at the public clinic in Clichy as well as other clinics and pharmaceutical companies. In his spare time he worked on his first novel, &quot;Voyage au bout de la nuit&quot; (&quot;Journey to the End of the Night&quot;), which was dedicated to Elizabeth, completing it in late 1931.

===Writer, physician and polemicist (1932–1939)===
&quot;Voyage au bout de la nuit&quot; was published in October 1932 to widespread critical attention. Although Destouches sought anonymity under the pen name Céline, his identity was soon revealed by the press. The novel attracted admirers and detractors across the political spectrum, with some praising its anarchist, anticolonialist and antimilitarist themes while one critic condemned it as &quot;the cynical, jeering confessions of a man without courage or nobility.&quot; A critic for &quot;Les Nouvelles littéraires&quot; praised the author&#x27;s use of spoken, colloquial French as an &quot;extraordinary language, the height of the natural and the artificial&quot; while the critic for &quot;Le&quot; &quot;Populaire de Paris&quot; condemned it as mere vulgarity and obscenity. The novel was the favourite for the &quot;Prix Goncourt&quot; of 1932. When the prize was awarded to Mazeline&#x27;s &quot;Les Loups&quot;, the resulting scandal increased publicity for Céline&#x27;s novel which sold 50,000 copies in the following two months.

Despite the success of &quot;Voyage&quot;, Céline saw his vocation as medicine and continued his work at the Clichy clinic and private pharmaceutical laboratories. He also began working on a novel about his childhood and youth which was to become &quot;Mort à Credit&quot; (1936) (tr &quot;Death on the Installment Plan&quot;). In June 1933 Elizabeth Craig returned permanently to America. Céline visited her in Los Angeles the following year but failed to persuade her to return.

Céline initially refused to take a public stance on the rise of Nazism and the increasing extreme-right political agitation in France, explaining to a friend in 1933: &quot;I am and have always been an anarchist, I have never voted…I will never vote for anything or anybody…I don&#x27;t believe in men….The Nazis loathe me as much as the socialists and the commies too.&quot; Nevertheless, in 1935, British critic William Empson had written that Céline appeared to be &quot;a man ripe for fascism&quot;.

&quot;Mort à credit&quot; was published in May 1936, with numerous blank spaces where passages had been removed by the publisher for fear of prosecution for obscenity. The critical response was sharply divided, with the majority of reviewers criticising it for gutter language, pessimism and contempt for humanity. The novel sold 35,000 copies up to late 1938.

In August Céline visited Leningrad for a month and on his return quickly wrote, and had published, an essay, &quot;Mea Culpa&quot;, in which he denounced communism and the Soviet Union.

In December the following year &quot;Bagatelles pour un massacre&quot; (&quot;Trifles for a Massacre&quot;) was published, a book-length racist and antisemitic polemic in which Céline advocated a military alliance with Hitler&#x27;s Germany in order to save France from war and Jewish hegemony. The book won qualified support from some sections of the French far-Right and sold 75,000 copies up to the end of the war. Céline followed &quot;Bagatelles&quot; with &quot;Ecole des cadavres&quot; (&quot;School for Corpses&quot;) (November 1938) in which he developed the themes of antisemitism and a Franco-German alliance.

Céline was now living with Lucette Almansor, a French dancer whom he had met in 1935. They were to marry in 1943 and remain together until Céline&#x27;s death. On the publication of &quot;Bagatelles&quot;, Céline quit his jobs at the Clichy clinic and the pharmaceutical laboratory and devoted himself to his writing.

=== 1939 to 1945 ===
At the outbreak of war in September 1939, the draft board declared Céline 70 per cent disabled and unfit for military service. Céline gained employment as a ship&#x27;s doctor on a troop transport and in January 1940 the ship accidentally rammed a British torpedo boat killing twenty British crew. In February he found a position as a doctor in a public clinic in Sartrouville, north-west of Paris. On the evacuation of Paris in June, Céline and Lucette commandeered an ambulance and evacuated an elderly woman and two newborn infants to La Rochelle. &quot;I did the retreat myself, like many another, I chased the French army all the way from Bezons to La Rochelle, but I could never catch up.&quot;

Returning to Paris, Céline was appointed head doctor of the Bezons public clinic and accredited physician to the département of Seine-et-Oise. He moved back to Montmartre and in February 1941 published a third polemical book &quot;Les beaux draps&quot; (A Fine Mess) in which he denounced Jews, Freemasons, the Catholic Church, the educational system and the French army. The book was later banned by the Vichy government for defaming the French military.

In October 1942, Céline&#x27;s antisemitic books &quot;Bagatelles pour une massacre&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;école des cadavres&quot; were republished in new editions, only months after the round-up of French Jews at the &quot;Vélodrome d&#x27;Hiver&quot;. Céline devoted most of his time during the occupation years to his medical work and writing a new novel, &quot;Guignol&#x27;s Band&quot;, a hallucinatory reworking of his experiences in London during World War I. The novel was published in March 1944 to poor sales.

The French were expecting an Allied landing at any time and Céline was receiving anonymous death threats almost daily. Although he had not officially joined any collaborationist organisations, he had frequently allowed himself to be quoted in the collaborationist press expressing antisemitic views. The BBC had also named him as a collaborationist writer.

When the Allies landed in France in June 1944, Céline and Lucette fled to Germany, eventually staying in Sigmaringen where the Germans had created an enclave accommodating the Vichy government in exile and collaborationist militia. Using his connections with the German occupying forces, in particular with SS officer who was often his guest in the apartment on Rue Girardon, Céline obtained visas for German-occupied Denmark where he arrived in late March 1945. These events formed the basis for his post-war trilogy of novels &quot;D&#x27;un chateau l&#x27;autre (1957, tr Castle to Castle)&quot;, &quot;Nord&quot; (1960, tr &quot;North&quot;) and &quot;Rigodon&quot; (1969, tr &quot;Rigadoon&quot;).

=== Exile in Denmark (1945–1951) ===
In November 1945 the new French government applied for Céline&#x27;s extradition for collaboration, and the following month he was arrested and imprisoned at Vestre Prison by the Danish authorities pending the outcome of the application. He was released from prison in June 1947 on the condition that he would not leave Denmark. Céline&#x27;s books had been withdrawn from sale in France, and he was living off a hoard of gold coins which he had hidden in Denmark before the war. In 1948 he moved to a farmhouse on the coast of the Great Belt owned by his Danish lawyer where he worked on the novels which were to become &quot;Féerie pour une autre fois&quot; (1952, tr &quot;Fable for Another Time&quot;) and &quot;Normance&quot; (1954).

The French authorities tried Céline &quot;in absentia&quot; for activities harmful to the national defence. He was found guilty in February 1951 and sentenced to one year in jail, a fine of 50,000 francs and confiscation of half his property. In April a French military tribunal granted him an amnesty based on his status as a disabled war veteran. In July he returned to France.

===Final years in France (1951–1961)===
Back in France, Céline signed a contract with the publisher Gallimard to republish all his novels. Céline and Lucette bought a villa in Meudon, on the southwestern outskirts of Paris, where Céline was to live for the remainder of his life. He registered as a doctor in 1953 and set up a practice in his Meudon home, while Lucette established a dance school on the top floor.

Céline&#x27;s first post-war novels, &quot;Féerie pour une autre fois&quot; and &quot;Normance&quot;, received little critical attention and sold poorly. However, his 1957 novel &quot;D&#x27;un château l&#x27;autre&quot;, a chronicle of his time in Sigmaringen, attracted considerable media and critical interest and revived the controversy over his wartime activities. The novel was a modest commercial success, selling close to 30,000 copies in its first year. A sequel, &quot;Nord&quot;, was published in 1960 to generally favourable reviews. Céline completed a second draft of his final novel, &quot;Rigodon&quot;, on 30 June 1961. He died at home of a ruptured aneurysm the following day.

==Antisemitism, fascism and collaboration==

While Céline&#x27;s first two novels contained no overt antisemitism, his polemical books &quot;Bagatelles pour un massacre&quot; (Trifles for a Massacre) (1937) and &quot;L&#x27;École des cadavres&quot; (The School of Corpses) (1938) are virulently antisemitic. Céline&#x27;s antisemitism was generally welcomed by the French far Right, but some, such as Brasillach, were concerned that its crudity might be counterproductive. Nevertheless, biographer Frédéric Vitoux concludes that: &quot;through the ferocity of his voice and the respect in which it was held, Céline had made himself the most popular and most resounding spokesman of pre-war antisemitism.&quot;

Céline&#x27;s public antisemitism continued after the defeat of France in June 1940. In 1941 he published &quot;Les beaux draps&quot; (A Fine Mess) in which he lamented that: &quot;France is Jewish and Masonic, once and for all.&quot; He also contributed over thirty letters, interviews and responses to questionnaires to the collaborationist press, including many antisemitic statements. The German officer and writer Ernst Jünger stated in his Paris war diaries that Céline told him on 7 December 1941 &quot;of his consternation, his astonishment&quot; that the Germans did not &quot;exterminate&quot; the French Jews. Some Nazis thought Céline&#x27;s antisemitic pronouncements were so extreme as to be counter-productive. , the German superintendent of propaganda in France, considered that Céline &quot;started from correct racial notions&quot; but his &quot;savage, filthy slang&quot; and &quot;brutal obscenities&quot; spoiled his &quot;good intentions&quot; with &quot;hysterical wailing&quot;.

Céline&#x27;s attitude towards fascism was ambiguous. In 1937 and 1938 he advocated a Franco-German military alliance to save France from war and Jewish hegemony. However, Vitoux argues that Céline&#x27;s main motive was a desire for peace at any cost, rather than enthusiasm for Hitler. Following the election victory of the French Popular Front in May 1936, Céline saw the socialist leader Léon Blum and the communists led by Maurice Thorez as greater threats to France than Hitler: &quot;…I&#x27;d prefer a dozen Hitlers to one all-powerful Blum.&quot;

While Céline claimed he was not a fascist and never joined any fascist organisation, in December 1941 he publicly supported the formation of a single party to unite the French far right. When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, he expressed his support for Jacques Doriot&#x27;s Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism (LVF). However, according to Merlin Thomas, Céline didn&#x27;t &quot;subscribe to any recognisable fascist ideology other than the attack on Jewry.&quot;

Following the war, Céline was found guilty of activities potentially harmful to national defence, due to his membership of the collaborationist Cercle Européen (which Céline denied) and his letters to collaborationist journals. According to Vitoux: &quot;Céline became a member of no committee and no administration (…). He never provided any assistance, either by report, advice, or information, to the German ambassador, let alone the Gestapo or the Central Jewish Office.&quot; Nevertheless: &quot;Céline&#x27;s writings had permanently marked French ideology, furthered and supported its antisemitism and consequently its complacency toward the Germans. That cannot be denied.&quot;

==Literary themes and style==

=== Themes ===
Céline&#x27;s novels reflect a pessimistic view of the human condition in which human suffering is inevitable, death is final, and hopes for human progress and happiness are illusory. He depicts a world where there is no moral order and where the rich and powerful will always oppress the poor and weak. According to Céline&#x27;s biographer Patrick McCarthy, Célinian man suffers from an original sin of malicious hatred, but there is no God to redeem him. &quot;The characteristic trait of Célinian hatred is that it is gratuitous: one does not dislike because the object of dislike has harmed one; one hates because one has to.&quot;

Literary critic Merlin Thomas notes that the experience of war marked Céline for life and it is a theme in all his novels except &quot;Death on the Installment Plan&quot;. In &quot;Journey to the End of the Night&quot;, Céline presents the horror and stupidity of war as an implacable force which &quot;turns the ordinary individual into an animal intent only on survival&quot;. McCarthy contends that for Céline war is &quot;the most striking manifestation of the evil present in the human condition.&quot;

The individual&#x27;s struggle for survival in a hostile world is a recurring theme in Céline&#x27;s novels. Although Célinian man can&#x27;t escape his fate, according to McCarthy: &quot;he has some control over his death. He need not be arbitrarily slaughtered in battle and he need not blind himself with &quot;divertissements&quot;. He can choose to face death, a more painful but more dignified process.&quot;

Merlin Thomas points out that the Célinian anti-hero also typically chooses defiance. &quot;If you are weak, then you will derive strength from stripping those you fear of all the prestige they pretend to possess (…) [T]he attitude of defiance just outlined is an element of hope and personal salvation.&quot;

Thomas notes that the Célinian narrator finds some consolation in beauty and creativity. The narrator is &quot;always touched by human physical beauty, by the contemplation of a splendidly formed human body which moves with grace.&quot; For Céline ballet and the ballerina are exemplars of artistic and human beauty. McCarthy points out that Céline habitually depicts the movement of people and objects as a dance and attempts to capture the rhythms of dance and music in language. &quot;Yet the dance is always the &quot;danse macabre&quot; and things disintegrate because death strikes them.&quot;

=== Style ===
Céline was critical of the French &quot;academic&quot; literary style which privileged elegance, clarity and exactitude. He advocated a new style aimed at directly conveying emotional intensity:&quot;It seemed to me that there were two ways of telling stories. The classic, normal, academic way which consists of creeping along from one incident to the next...the way cars go along in the street...and then, the other way, which means descending into the intimacy of things, into the fibre, the nerves, the feelings of things, the flesh, and going straight on to the end, to its end, in intimacy, in maintained poetic tension, in inner life, like the &quot;métro&quot; through an inner city, straight to the end...[.]&quot; Céline was a major innovator in French literary language. In his first two novels&quot;, Journey to the End of the Night&quot; and &quot;Death on the Installment Plan&quot;, Céline shocked many critics by his use of a unique language based on the spoken French of the working class, medical and nautical jargon, neologisms, obscenities, and the specialised slang of soldiers, sailors and the criminal underworld. He also developed an idiosyncratic system of punctuation based on extensive use of ellipses and exclamation marks. Thomas sees Céline&#x27;s three dots as: &quot;almost comparable to the pointing of a psalm: they divide the text into rhythmical rather than syntactical units, permit extreme variations of pace and make possible to a great extent the hallucinatory lyricism of his style.&quot;

Céline called his increasingly rhythmic, syncopated writing style his &quot;little music.&quot; McCarthy writes that in &quot;Fables for Another Time&quot;: &quot;Celine&#x27;s fury drives him beyond prose and into a new tongue – part poetry and part music – to express what he has to say.&quot; Céline&#x27;s style evolved to reflect the themes of his novels. According to McCarthy, in Céline&#x27;s final war trilogy, &quot;Castle to Castle&quot;, &quot;North&quot; and &quot;Rigadoon&quot;: &quot;all worlds disappear into an eternal nothingness (…) the trilogy is written in short, bare phrases: language dissolves as reality does.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Céline is widely considered to be one of the major French novelists of the twentieth century. According to George Steiner: &quot;[T]wo bodies of work lead into the idiom and sensibility of twentieth-century narrative: that of Céline and that of Proust.&quot;

Although many writers have admired and have been influenced by Céline&#x27;s fiction, McCarthy argues that he holds a unique place in modern writing due to his pessimistic vision of the human condition and idiosyncratic writing style. Writers of the absurd, such as Sartre and Camus, were influenced by Céline, but didn&#x27;t share his extreme pessimism or politics. Alain Robbe-Grillet cites Céline as a major influence on the &quot;nouveau-roman&quot; and Günter Grass also shows a debt to Céline&#x27;s writing style. Patrick Modiano admires Céline as a stylist, and produced a parody of his style in his debut novel &quot;La place de l&#x27;étoile.&quot; McCarthy and O&#x27;Connell include Henry Miller, William S. Burroughs, Kurt Vonnegut and others as American writers influenced by Céline.

Céline remains a controversial figure in France. In 2011, the fiftieth anniversary of Céline&#x27;s death, the writer had initially appeared on an official list of 500 people and events associated with French culture which were to be celebrated nationally that year. Following protests, Frédéric Mitterrand, then French Minister of Culture and Communication, announced that Céline would be removed from the list because of his antisemitic writings.

In December 2017, the French government and Jewish leaders expressed concern over plans by the publisher Gallimard to republish Céline&#x27;s antisemitic books. In January 2018 Gallimard announced that it was suspending publication. In March Gallimard clarified that it still intended to publish a critical edition of the books with scholarly introductions.

A collection of Céline&#x27;s unpublished manuscripts including &quot;La Volonté du roi Krogold&quot;, &quot;Londres&quot;, and 6,000 unpublished pages of already published works (&quot;Casse-pipe&quot;, &quot;Mort à crédit&quot;, &quot;Journey to the End of the Night&quot;), were handed over by a &quot;Libération&quot; journalist, Jean-Pierre Thibaudat, to the Nanterre police in March 2020, and revealed in August 2021. The manuscripts had been missing since Céline fled Paris in 1944. French writer and Céline expert David Alliot maintains that it will take many years for these writings to be completely appreciated and published. Writing in &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; in September 2021, Oliver Kamm described Céline as a &quot;French literary hero [who] needs to be forgotten&quot;. The lost manuscripts of Céline have been described as &quot;one of the greatest literary discoveries of the past century, but also one of the most troubling&quot;.

In May 2022, Céline&#x27;s &quot;Guerre&quot; (War) was published by Gallimard, and &quot;Londres&quot; (London) followed in October 2022. The latter novel was probably written in 1934 and includes a key character who is a Jewish doctor.

<text>Aerovías de México, S.A. de C.V. () operating as Aeroméxico (; styled as AM), is the flag carrier of Mexico based in Mexico City. It operates scheduled services to more than 90 destinations in Mexico, North, South and Central America, the Caribbean, Europe, and Asia. Its main base and hub is Mexico City International Airport, with secondary hubs in Guadalajara and Monterrey. The headquarters is in the Torre MAPFRE on Paseo de la Reforma.

Grupo Aeroméxico includes Aeroméxico and Aeroméxico Connect (regional subsidiary). The group currently holds the No. 2 place in domestic market share behind Volaris, with 24.2%; and No. 1 place in international market share with 15.8%, in the 12 months ending March 2020, becoming Mexico&#x27;s largest international airline group. Aeroméxico is one of the four founding members of the SkyTeam airline alliance, along with Air France, Delta Air Lines and Korean Air.

Aeroméxico works closely with the U.S. carrier Delta Air Lines, which owns part of Aeroméxico and in 2015 announced its intention to acquire up to 49% of the latter&#x27;s shares. On 8 May 2017, a joint commercial agreement (JCA), came into effect, whereby the airlines share information, costs, and revenues on all their flights between the United States and Mexico.

In 2016, Aeroméxico flew 19.703 million passengers (up 5.0% vs. previous year), of which 13.047 million domestic (+3.7%) and 6.656 million international (+7.6%). It flew 34.776 million revenue passenger kilometers (RPKs), had 43.362 million available seat kilometers (ASKs), and an 80.3% load factor.

==History==

===1934===

The airline was established as Aeronaves de México on 15 September 1934, by Antonio Díaz Lombardo. Its first aircraft was a Stinson SR Reliant 5A (registered XB-AJI). Julio Zinser piloted the maiden flight on the Mexico City – Acapulco route on 14 September 1934.

===1940s===
When World War II began, the airline continued to grow with the help of Pan Am, which owned 40% of the new Mexican airline and upgrade the fleet with DC-2s and Boeing 247s. Aeroméxico saw few changes for the next two decades. However, during the 1950s, renovation began, and the airline took over various small competitor companies across the country, including Aerovías Guest (the second airline of the country at that time) that held the routes to Madrid and Paris. Aeroméxico added aircraft including the Douglas DC-3 and its successor, the Douglas DC-4.

===1950s===
During the late 1950s, the Douglas DC-4s were replaced by some pressurized Douglas DC-6s and two Bristol Britannias (the first turboprop passenger aircraft in the fleet) and in 1958, services were inaugurated to Idlewild Airport (now JFK) using the Britannias. The Mexico City-New York route would prove profitable for &quot;Aeronaves&quot; and its North American competitors. The airline was nationalised in 1959.

===1960s===
In the early 1960s, the fleet of Aeronaves de México (Aeroméxico) included Douglas DC-3, Douglas DC-6, and Bristol Britannia aircraft. Starting in 1961, &quot;Aeronaves&quot; began replacing its piston-engined aircraft with new jets. The first jet-engined aircraft were a pair of Douglas DC-8s. The DC-8s were used on routes within Mexico and to New York City. In 1963, Aeronaves de México (Aeroméxico) took over Aerovias Guest airlines and they were merged under the name Aeronaves de México. Later in the 1960s, more DC-8s were added and service to Europe was resumed, operated by two de Havilland Comet 4C jet aircraft dry-leased by Aerovías Guest prior to the merger.

===1970s===

The 1970s brought dramatic changes for Aeroméxico. In 1970, under a government plan, Mexican domestic airlines were nationalized into an integrated air transport system under the control of Aeronaves de México. The system included eight smaller carriers, although these were later disbanded.
During the early 1970s, the remaining Douglas DC-6 and Bristol Britannia aircraft were retired. A new color scheme (orange and black) was introduced and the airline changed its name from &quot;Aeronaves de México&quot; to its current, shortened version of Aeroméxico in February 1972.

One of Aeronaves de Mexico&#x27;s subsidiaries during that era was named Aeronaves del Sureste (&quot;Southeast Air Ships&quot;). That subsidiary had a mix of Twin-Otter and DC-9 jets aircraft.

Aeroméxico, as one of the launch customers of the McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 program, received the first of its aircraft in 1974. That same year, the airline also took delivery of its first seven McDonnell Douglas DC-9-32s. 

During this period, the airline&#x27;s popularity and visibility grew dramatically. This was due in part to Aeroméxico&#x27;s involvement in Mexican movies. Basically, every time characters in any movie produced in Mexico had to fly somewhere, they were depicted as flying on Aeroméxico aircraft.

===1980s===

The early 1980s were marked by expansion. A new color scheme was introduced (orange paint and silver), two DC-10-15s and a DC-10-30 were added in 1981 and in 1984. Aeroméxico, one of the launch customers of the McDonnell Douglas MD-82 (an elongated version of the DC-9), received its first two in late 1981. Between 1980 and 1981, eight more DC-9-32 aircraft were added.
On 31 August 1986, the company suffered its only fatal accident outside Mexico when Aeroméxico Flight 498, a Douglas DC-9, approaching Los Angeles International Airport was struck by a light aircraft. Both aircraft then fell to earth in the Los Angeles suburb of Cerritos, California. All 64 passengers and crew on board the DC-9-32 were killed, as were the three people in the light aircraft and 15 people on the ground. After three years and a long trial, the aircraft&#x27;s crew and the airline were found not to blame. This was because the pilot of the Piper had strayed into an air traffic control zone reserved for commercial flights. That same year, the airline acquired the charter carrier GATSA and used it for charter operations until December.
In April 1988, the state-owned company was declared bankrupt and grounded for three months because of lack of organization, a fleet with an average of 20 years without a renovation plan and a depredating administration by the Mexican Government. In August, a privatization program was underway. This involved retiring the eight Douglas DC-8s along with the remaining ten DC-9-15 aircraft. After a strike and bankruptcy between April and May 1988, a privatization process started and included a new corporate name (Aerovias de Mexico SA de CV). The airline restarted operations with some of its predecessor&#x27;s assets, including the headquarters building, maintenance hangar, some aircraft, and some former Aeronaves de Mexico employees.

===1990s===
The early 1990s were turbulent times, with the rise in fuel costs due to the Gulf War, and a domestic fare war caused by start-up airlines like TAESA, Servicios Aéreos Rutas Oriente, Aviacsa, among others, as well as constant labor problems. In April 1991, the first two 767-200ERs were introduced to the fleet to replace DC-10s in services to Europe, New York, and Tijuana, and another two 767-300ERs joined the fleet later that year. This was all a part of a renovation and expansion program to introduce 24 direct flights to Madrid and Paris from Mexico City with Boeing 767s as well as services to Frankfurt via Paris and Rome via Madrid.

In 1992, Grupo Aeroméxico was among other investors that failed to consummate the acquisition of Continental Airlines. After failing to invest in Continental, Aeroméxico acquired the bankrupt Aeroperú from the Peruvian government.

In 1993, Aeroméxico Group took over Mexicana, the second-largest airline in the Mexican market under the same management. There was a great dispute in June 1993 with the pilot union regarding the transfer of flights to regional subsidiary Aeromonterrey, which had non-union pilots. Between 1994 and 1995, the six DC-10 aircraft in the fleet were finally retired. Their last revenue flight was in 1995.

In December 1994, three weeks after Carlos Salinas de Gortari left the office, the first of several devaluations in the next 18 months started, giving way to the Mexican peso crisis. As a consequence, Aeroméxico had to cut capacity and flights to Frankfurt and Rome were canceled, four McDonnell Douglas MD-80s and four Boeing 767s were returned to their lessors, early retirement for pilots and other staff was underway, and a new Boeing 767 due for delivery in April 1995 was instead transferred to another airline. Flights to Madrid and Paris were operated only by two Boeing 767-300ER jets.

In 1996, Cintra was created to prevent the two main carriers from going bankrupt. Some Boeing 757s of Aeroméxico&#x27;s original renovation program were transferred to Mexicana and Aeroperú. The market and the airline recovered between 1996 and 1998; eight McDonnell Douglas MD80s were leased back along with two Boeing 767-200ERs.

The sale of Grupo Cintra was scheduled after several delays in September 1999, and with the looming presidential elections in 2000, everything was delayed once again. The ruling party lost the election after 70 years in office and all the policies changed. Due to the recession in 2000, the new government put everything on hold, waiting for better economic conditions to start the stock sell-off, and just when everything was about to start, the 11 September 2001 attacks occurred and nothing materialized since the two main carriers, Mexicana and Aeroméxico, were losing large amounts of money.

===2000s===
Between 2000 and 2005, Aeroméxico had an average fleet of 60 aircraft in mainline operation, plus 20 in Aerolitoral, as well as five CEOs during this time. On 22 June 2000, the airline, along with Air France, Delta, and Korean Air, founded the SkyTeam global airline alliance. After 9/11 and the Iraq War, it pursued a fleet renovation program. In 2003, the airline acquired its first Boeing 737-700 instead of the Boeing 717 as a replacement for its aging DC-9 aircraft. On 29 March 2006, Aeroméxico CEO Andrés Conesa announced the inauguration of direct flights between Japan and Mexico City via Tijuana. This was after the purchase of two Boeing 777-200ERs, making Aeroméxico the third airline in Latin America to fly regularly to Asia, after Varig and the now-defunct VASP. Since Varig&#x27;s demise, Aeroméxico is currently the only airline with this service. Aeroméxico resumed its Mexico City-Tijuana-Shanghai route twice a week as of 30 March 2010. Suspension of this flight was due to the 2009 flu pandemic.

On 29 June 2006, the International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) and Aeroméxico announced that the airline would operate three Boeing 787 Dreamliners. Aeroméxico&#x27;s deliveries were scheduled to begin in early 2012. From 2006, Consorcio Aeroméxico S.A. de C.V., the parent company of Aeroméxico at the time, faced large debts and had no profits to pay them off, so it offered Aeroméxico for sale in 2007. In early October, a week-long auction was held, with Grupo Financiero Banamex, a unit of Citigroup, competing against the Saba family. On 17 October 2007, Banamex offered the highest bid and purchased the airline for US$249.1 million. In October 2010, Aeroméxico&#x27;s largest competitor, Mexicana de Aviacion, filed for bankruptcy and was placed in administration.

===2010s===
====Delta/Aeroméxico alliance====
In 2011, Delta Air Lines and Aeroméxico signed an enhanced commercial alliance, building on an original agreement from 1994. The 2011 agreement provided for codeshare on all the carriers&#x27; Mexico–US flights; Delta investing US$65 million in Aeroméxico shares; and Delta gaining a seat on the Aeroméxico board of directors. 
* In March 2014, the airlines opened Tech Ops Mexico, a US$55 million joint maintenance, repair, and overhaul facility in Queretaro City, Mexico. 
*In March 2015, the airlines filed applications for antitrust immunity, a first step in the creation of a US$1.5 billion joint cooperation agreement (JCA) that will allow Delta and Aeroméxico to jointly sell, and share costs and profits on all Mexico–U.S. routes. 
*In May 2015, Mexican regulator approved the JCA; and in the same month, the Mexican Senate approved Open Skies between the U.S. and Mexico. 
* In November 2016, the DOT approved the joint venture under strict conditions that the airlines give up slots in both Mexico City and New York-JFK.

====Dreamliners====
On 25 July 2012, Aeroméxico CEO Andrés Conesa announced the purchase of six Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners. The new order was added to the package of 20 aircraft that the company had announced in 2011 and nine more Boeing 787-8 Dreamliners already provided. The delivery of the Dreamliners began in the summer of 2013. The total investment is US$11 billion and includes the acquisition of 90 Boeing 737 MAX 8s, which began delivering from 2018. The airline took delivery of its first Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner (sourced from the ILFC order book) in early August 2013 and officially launched commercial service on 1 October 2013. Between 2013 and 2015, the remaining eight were delivered (seven leased and two owned by Aeroméxico outright).

In September 2016, Aeroméxico received its first Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner. This particular frame, registered XA-ADL, is named after and painted in a unique commemorating Quetzalcoatl, a major figure in Aztec culture of pre-Hispanic Mexico, as the result of a &quot;Design in the Air&quot; competition hosted by the airline inviting students at select universities in Mexico to submit a potential design to be painted on the airframe.

====Branded fares====
In February 2018, Aeroméxico introduced a new branded fares structure, which included a new Basic fare that did not contain a checked luggage allowance, nor did it allow for seat assignments, upgrades, or changes.

===2020===
==== Bankruptcy ====
The COVID-19 pandemic deeply affected the global aviation industry, including Aeroméxico. Aeroméxico&#x27;s stock dropped during first half of 2020 and rumors about bankruptcy. On June 30, Aeroméxico voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States. However, day-to-day operations continued as the company restructured. Existing tickets were honored and employees continued to be paid as usual.

On July 1, 2021, shareholder Delta Air Lines announced it would purchase $185 million of the Mexican airline&#x27;s Chapter 11 debt.

On August 28, 2024, Aeroméxico unveiled a new livery in celebration of the airline&#x27;s 90th anniversary.

===Technology===

In 2016, Aeroméxico added 2Ku WiFi service by Gogo to some 737-800 aircraft, including access to Netflix. On its Dreamliners, it added Panasonic broadband Internet, and on Embraer narrow-body aircraft, streaming entertainment via Gogo&#x27;s Gogo Vision.

In July 2016, the airline launched a completely new website and new check-in kiosks at Mexico City Airport. That same year, the airline also co-sponsored the launch of startup accelerator MassChallenge in Mexico.

In August 2017, the company became the Mexico launch customers of digital agency MediaMonks and together, they released a new mobile app.

=== Controversies ===
Aeroméxico has been accused of racist behavior, with allegations including removing passengers from planes because they were Indigenous. Most complaints of discrimination against the airline have been reported as being due to skin color or ethnic origin. In May 2022, Aeroméxico prevented Nahuatl film maker David Cayetano from boarding a plane to Australia, where he was to present his film &quot;Tsontiajakatl, el último viento&quot; (Tsontiajakatl, the Last Wind). Aeroméxico falsely claimed that Cayetano did not have the required vaccines, leading to accusations that he was instead prevented from flying due to his indigenous ethnicity. A significant number of complaints emerged in August 2022 after a video of indigenous family being removed from a flight was shared on social media. The father of the family claimed he was removed &quot;because of his appearance&quot;, though that cannot be heard in the video. Aeroméxico did not comment on the incident.

===Chat platform===
In September 2016, Aeroméxico became the first airline in the Americas to launch a chatbot, that enables customers to search, track and book flights interacting with a virtual assistant on Facebook Messenger. During the Facebook F8 conference in April 2017, the airline earned praise from Facebook for being among the first companies worldwide to launch the Chat Extension function, allowing users to pull up Aerobot during a group chat. It also launched the ability to ask any question, using artificial intelligence and natural language processing techniques to match the questions with answers.

In September 2017, Aeroméxico announced that it would be among the first companies worldwide to start services on WhatsApp&#x27;s new Enterprise solution – the first time large companies would be able to provide customer service to users at scale. In February 2018, the company announced development of further features together with its partner Yalochat, such as purchase confirmation and flight notifications via WhatsApp, and deepening the artificial intelligence used on its chat platform.

==Destinations==
===New destinations===
In an attempt to gain more worldwide presence and strengthen its network and to make connections easier and more frequent, Aeroméxico entered new international markets. In 2006, it started operations to Tokyo from Mexico City via Tijuana. Service to Shanghai from Mexico City via Tijuana began in May 2008. New destinations in 2015–2016 included Panama City (Panama), Santo Domingo, Vancouver, Toronto, Boston, Medellín, Amsterdam, Cozumel, and Austin (Texas). The airline launched service to Seoul from Mexico City (with a stop in Monterrey only on the outbound flight) on 1 July 2017.

In the first year of the Delta–Aeroméxico joint venture (June 2017–June 2018) the companies worked to enhance connectivity between Mexico and the U.S., and launched new Aeroméxico or Delta flights, or additional frequencies, on Los Angeles–Cabo San Lucas, New York JFK–Cancun, Detroit–León, Atlanta–Mérida, Seattle–Mexico City, Atlanta–Querétaro, Atlanta–León, Portland–Mexico City, Los Angeles–Leon, Atlanta–Guadalajara, and Guadalajara–Salt Lake City.

* On 20 June 1973, Douglas DC-9-15 &quot;XA-SOC&quot; near Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, Aeroméxico Flight 229, a daily service from George Bush Intercontinental Airport to Licenciado Gustavo Díaz Ordaz International Airport, crashed into the side of a mountain while on approach, killing all 27 people on board.
* On 2 September 1976, Douglas DC-9-15 &quot;XA-SOF&quot; operating as Aeroméxico Flight 152 overran the runway at León, Guanajuato-Del Bajío Airport where it was damaged beyond repair. No injuries were reported.
* On 11 November 1979, an Aeroméxico DC-10, named &quot;Castillo de Chapultepec&quot; and operating as AM flight 945 from Frankfurt to Mexico City, with a stop-over in Miami, experienced trouble over Luxembourg. The airplane lost almost 12,000 feet of altitude, beginning at 29,800 feet and ending at about 18,000 feet. The crew at first wanted to divert to Madrid but decided to continue the flight to Miami instead. The plane landed in Miami without further incident but upon de-boarding it, crews discovered that a portion of the outboard elevators and of the lower fuselage tail area maintenance access door had fallen off during the flight. There were no injuries to the 311 passengers and crew on board.
* On 27 July 1981, Aeroméxico Flight 230 &quot;XA-DEN&quot;, a Douglas DC-9-32, crashed while landing in Chihuahua, killing 32 of the 66 people on board.
* On 8 November 1981, &quot;XA-DEO&quot;, a Douglas DC-9-32 flying from Acapulco to Guadalajara crashed in the mountains of the state of Guerrero.
* On 31 August 1986, Aeroméxico Flight 498, operated with a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-32, was on its final approach into Los Angeles International Airport, United States, when it collided with a Piper PA-28 Archer over Cerritos, California. The resulting crash killed all 67 people on both aircraft and 15 people on the ground in Cerritos.
* On 6 October 2000, Aeroméxico Flight 250 &quot;N936ML&quot;, a Douglas DC-9-31, overran the runway at General Lucio Blanco International Airport, Reynosa, Mexico, killing 4 people on the ground.

* On 31 July 2018, Aeroméxico Connect Flight 2431 crashed on takeoff from Durango International Airport. Shortly after becoming airborne, the plane encountered sudden wind shear caused by a microburst. The plane rapidly lost speed and altitude and impacted the runway, detaching the engines and skidding to a halt about 1,000 feet (300 m) beyond the runway. The plane caught fire and was destroyed. All 103 people on board survived, but 39 passengers and crew members were injured. 
* On 5 January 2023, Aeroméxico Connect Flight 165 operated with an Embraer 190, registration code XA-ALW, aborted takeoff from Culiacán International Airport after being hit by a bullet.

The bullet was shot during a series of clashes between Mexican Armed Forces and criminal groups in the surroundings of the airport, after a drug cartel leader was captured by Mexican authorities. In the same fashion, two Mexican Air Force airplanes, a B737-800 and a CASA C-295, which were in the airport were damaged.

<text>In Greek mythology, Nausinous () was the son of Odysseus and Calypso. In Theogony by Hesiod, he is said to have a brother named Nausithous.

== Mythology ==
While stranded on Ogygia, Odysseus was forced to become the lover of Calypso. According to Hesiod, this union resulted in two sons, named Nausinous and Nausithous. Neither Nausinous nor his brother are mentioned in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;.

<text>Bopis (&quot;bópiz&quot; in Spanish) is a piquant Filipino dish of pork or beef lungs and heart sautéed in tomatoes, chilies and onions.

This spicy Filipino dish has Spanish origins, but the meaning in its original language, and even region of origin, are now lost. It could be Frito de Matanza, a variation of Frito Mallorquin.

== Preparation ==
It is sauteed and stir-fried (until crispy) with finely-chopped pig innards and cooked in onion, tomato, garlic, and pepper.

Recipes for bopis may differ from region to region and family to family, with regard to ingredients, spices and flavoring. 

Classified as &quot;pulutan&quot; in Filipino cuisine, &quot;bopis&quot; is served with alcoholic beverages, or as a main dish with rice.

<text>Queens Park Rangers Football Club, commonly abbreviated to QPR, is a professional association football club based in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, West London, England. The team currently compete in the EFL Championship, the second level of the English football league system.

The club was founded as Christchurch Rangers in 1882 and took up their current name after merging with St Judes Institute four years later, near the Queen&#x27;s Park and Kensal areas. Having won the West London League in 1898–99, QPR joined the Southern and Western leagues where they won titles in both. It was during this period that the club reached the final of the FA Charity Shield twice in 1908 and 1912. QPR were elected to the Football League in 1920. The club played in the Third Division South until winning promotion as champions in 1947–48. The club was relegated in 1952, but slowly rebuilt under the stewardship of Alec Stock which culminated in winning the Third Division title and also their only major trophy to date, the League Cup in the 1966–67 season. Promoted from the Second Division in 1967–68, they were relegated after one season in the First Division. QPR won promotion again in 1972–73 and then narrowly missed out winning the English league title in 1975–76, finishing only one point behind champions Liverpool. Relegated in 1979, they reached the FA Cup final as a second-tier club in 1982, losing to Tottenham Hotspur after a replay.

QPR won another Second Division title in 1982–83 and were beaten finalists in the 1986 League Cup final. They remained in the top-flight for thirteen years, becoming founder members of the Premier League in 1992, before being relegated in 1996. Relegated again in 2001, they secured promotion from the third tier at the end of the 2003–04 campaign. QPR won promotion as winners of the Championship in 2010–11, although they were relegated from the Premier League after two seasons. They won an immediate promotion via the play-offs in 2014 but were relegated again the following season and have remained in the Championship since that time.

After a nomadic early existence, QPR have played home matches at Loftus Road since 1917, apart from two brief spells at the White City Stadium. They share rivalries with various other clubs; most notably they contest the West London derby against Chelsea
==History==

===Early History (1882 - 1920s)===

The club was formed in 1886, when a team known as St Jude&#x27;s (formed in 1884) merged with Christchurch Rangers (formed in 1882). The resulting team were called Queen&#x27;s Park Rangers and their official formation date is considered to be 1882, which is the original founding date of Christchurch Rangers. The club&#x27;s name came from the fact that most of the players came from the Queen&#x27;s Park area of West London. St Jude&#x27;s Institute on Ilbert Street W10 is still in use as a community hall and in July 2011 club icon Stan Bowles unveiled a plaque celebrating its place in QPR history.
1882: QPR was founded as Queens Park Rangers by a group of schoolboys from the area of Queen’s Park in North-West London. The club initially played in local leagues and was part of the amateur football movement.

QPR became a professional team in 1889. The club was elected into the Southern Football League in 1899. In 1899–1900 they put themselves on the map after qualifying for the first round proper of the FA Cup by beating Wolverhampton Wanderers on their own ground 1–0. The Guardian said &quot;the hitherto unknown Queens Park Rangers, a team hailing from the north-west suburbs of London...upset all calculations.&quot;

At this time the club&#x27;s core support, as indicated by its marketing area, was an area of West London, to the west of the A5 Road (Roman Watling Street), in and around the former Boroughs of Paddington and Willesden. As London extended further west, the club&#x27;s following grew along with it.

They first won the Southern Football League in 1907–08. As Southern League champions that year, they played in the first ever Charity Shield match, against the Football League champions Manchester United. The club lost 4–0 in a replay after the first game had finished 1–1. Both games were played at Stamford Bridge. QPR were Southern League champions for a second time in 1911-12.

===Rise to Prominence (1920s - 1960s)===

The club joined the Football League in 1920, when the Third Division was formed, mainly with Southern League clubs. When the Third Division was split into North and South the following season, QPR, like most of the former Southern League clubs that had joined the Football League to form the Third Division, were in the Third Division (South).

QPR played their home games in nearly 20 different stadia - a league record - before permanently settling at Loftus Road in 1917; although the team would briefly attempt to attract larger crowds by playing at the White City Stadium for two short spells: 1931 to 1933, and the 1962–63 season.

The club were promoted as champions of Division 3 South in the 1947–48 season. Dave Mangnall was the manager as the club participated in four seasons of the Second Division, being relegated in 1951–52. Tony Ingham was signed from Leeds United and went on to make the most-ever league appearances for QPR (519). Arguably the club&#x27;s greatest ever manager, Alec Stock, arrived prior to the start of the 1959–60 season. The 1960–61 season saw QPR achieve their biggest win to date: 9–2 vs Tranmere Rovers in a Division 3 match. In time, Stock, together with Jim Gregory who arrived as chairman in the mid-1960s, helped to achieve a total transformation of the club and its surroundings.

In 1966–67, QPR won the Division Three championship and became the first Third Division club to win the League Cup, on Saturday, 4 March 1967, beating West Bromwich Albion 3–2, after coming back from a two-goal deficit, securing the clubs first and only major trophy. It was also the first League Cup final to be held at Wembley Stadium. After winning promotion in 1968 to the top flight for the first time in their history, Rangers were relegated after just one season and spent the next four years in Division Two.

=== The Golden Era (1970s)===

Terry Venables joined from Spurs at the beginning of the 1969–70 season and Rodney Marsh was sold to Manchester City. During this time, new QPR heroes emerged including Phil Parkes, Don Givens, Dave Thomas and Stan Bowles. These new signings were in addition to home-grown talent such as Dave Clement, Ian Gillard, Mick Leach and Gerry Francis.

In 1972 QPR were promoted to Division One (the top tier of English football) for the first time in their history, under manager Jim Gregory.

In 1974, Dave Sexton joined as manager and in 1975–76 led QPR to the runners-up spot in the First Division, missing out on the championship by only one point, with a squad containing seven England internationals and internationals from the home nations. After completing their 42-game season, QPR sat at the top of the league, one point ahead of Liverpool who went on to defeat Wolverhampton Wanderers to clinch the title. Wolves were relegated to the Second Division that same season. The late 1970s also saw some cup success with Rangers reaching the semi-finals of the League Cup and in their first entry into European football reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup losing to AEK Athens on penalties. Following Sexton&#x27;s departure in 1977 the club eventually slipped into the Second Division in 1979.

===Promotions, Relegations and two cup finals (1980s)===

In 1980 Terry Venables took over as manager and in 1981 the club installed an artificial turf pitch. In 1982 QPR, still playing in the Second Division, reached the FA Cup final for the only time in the club&#x27;s history, facing holders Tottenham Hotspur. Tottenham won 1–0 in a replay. The following season QPR went on to win the Second Division championship and returned to English football&#x27;s top division. After a respectable fifth-place finish, and UEFA Cup qualification, the following year, Venables departed to become manager of Barcelona. In 1988 the club had a new chairman, 24-year-old Richard Thompson. Over the next seven years, various managers came and went at Loftus Road and the club spent many seasons finishing mid-table and avoiding relegation. The most successful season during this period was the 1987–88 season in which QPR finished fifth, although missing out on a UEFA Cup campaign due to the ban on English clubs in European competition as a result of the Heysel Stadium disaster. They were also runners-up in the 1986 League Cup, losing to Oxford United.

===The Premier League Years and Relegation (1990s)===

Gerry Francis, a key player in the 1970s QPR side who had proved himself as a successful manager with Bristol Rovers, was appointed manager in the summer of 1991. In his first season in charge they finished mid-table in the league and in the 1992–93 season were founder members of the inaugural Premier League, finishing fifth, as top London club. Francis oversaw one of QPR&#x27;s most famous victories, the 4–1 win at Old Trafford in front of live TV on New Year&#x27;s Day 1992. Midway through the 1994–95 season Francis resigned and very quickly became manager of Tottenham Hotspur and Ray Wilkins was installed as player-manager. Wilkins led QPR to an eighth-place finish in the Premiership. In July 1995 the club&#x27;s top goalscorer, Les Ferdinand, was sold for a club record fee of £6 million to Newcastle United.

QPR struggled throughout the following season and were relegated at the end of the 1995–96 season. QPR then competed in Division 1 until 2001 under a succession of managers including club legend Gerry Francis who was reappointed for a second spell finishing mainly mid-table and towards the bottom half of the division.

===Relegation, promotion, financial struggles and the arrival of Bernie &amp; Flavio (2000s)===

After several years of struggle in the second tier, QPR became embroiled in financial and boardroom controversy. Although the club had floated on the Alternative Investment Market in 1991, in 2001 it entered administration (receivership). A period of financial hardship followed and the club left administration after receiving a £10m high-interest emergency loan which continued to burden the club. The 00–01 season proved to be a disaster and Francis resigned in early 2001. Former Rangers midfielder Ian Holloway was appointed manager but failed to prevent the club from being relegated to the third division at the end of the season, the first time since the 1960s. 
After relegation Holloway assembled a team featuring several QPR fans in the squad including Kevin Gallen, Marc Bircham and Richard Langley alongside other key players such as Danny Shittu, Gareth Ainsworth and Clarke Carlisle. In their second season in the third tier, the club reached the play-off final in Cardiff, losing 0-1 to Cardiff City in extra time. The following season QPR put their playoff heartache behind them and returned to Division 1 after as runners-up, with a famous 3-1 win away at Hillsborough in front of 7000 travelling Rangers fans.

Rangers struggled for consistent form over the next two campaigns before Holloway was suspended amidst rumours of his impending departure for Leicester City. A poor series of results and lack of progress at the club saw Holloway&#x27;s successors Gary Waddock and later John Gregory – both former players – fail to hold on to the manager job.

Scandals involving the directors, shareholders and others emerged in 2005–06 season and included allegations of blackmail and threats of violence against the club&#x27;s chairman Gianni Paladini. In an unrelated incident, QPR were further rocked by the murder of youth team player Kiyan Prince on 18 May 2006 and, in August 2007, the death of teenager and promising first-team player Ray Jones in a car crash.

Rangers continued to face mounting financial pressure, in the September 2007 it was announced that the club had been bought by wealthy Formula One businessmen Flavio Briatore and Bernie Ecclestone (see &quot;Ownership and finances&quot; below).. John Gregory&#x27;s reign as manager came to an end in October 2007 after a string of poor results left QPR at the bottom of the Championship and he was replaced by Luigi De Canio until the end of the 2007–08 season. Further investment followed in early 2008 as the club looked to push for promotion to the Premier League within four years, on the back of greater financial stability. On 14 May 2008, Iain Dowie was announced as the manager to begin the campaign to return Rangers to the top flight. However, on 24 October 2008, Dowie was sacked after just 15 games in charge of the club.
On 19 November 2008, QPR named former Portugal midfielder Paulo Sousa as their new first team coach. However, on 9 April 2009, his contract was terminated after he allegedly divulged confidential information without authority. On the same day as Sousa&#x27;s sacking, player/coach Gareth Ainsworth was appointed as player/caretaker manager for a second time. In June 2009 Jim Magilton was named as new manager of QPR. Despite leading QPR to a good start to the 2009–10 season, a loss of form combined with an alleged head-butting incident with Hungarian midfielder Ákos Buzsáky saw the club further embroiled in controversy. Magilton left the club by mutual consent on 16 December 2009, along with his assistant John Gorman. They were replaced by Paul Hart and Mick Harford on the next day.

===Promotions to the Premier League and Relegations from it (2010s)===

Less than a month and only five games after becoming manager at QPR, Paul Hart parted with the club on 14 January 2010; the reasons for his leaving the club were unstated.

On 1 March 2010, experienced Championship manager Neil Warnock joined Queens Park Rangers as manager on a three-and-a-half-year deal after agreeing compensation with Crystal Palace. After comfortably helping the club avoid relegation in the 10-11 season, Warnock assembled a squad consisting mainly of Championship veterans such as Shaun Derry, Clint Hill, Paddy Kenny with previous on loan playmaker Adel Taarabt being given a central role in the team and given the captains armband.

On 30 April 2011, QPR secured promotion to the Premier League by winning the Championship with a 2–0 win over Watford. A subsequent FA investigation involving QPR&#x27;s acquisition of Alejandro Faurlín threatened to deduct points from the side and put their promotion into jeopardy. The investigation concluded on 7 May 2011, with QPR found to be at fault in two of the seven charges, and received an £875,000 fine. However, there were no points deducted by the FA, and QPR&#x27;s promotion to the Premier League was secured.

After the club was promoted Eccleston and Briatore sold their shared to Malaysian billionaire and Air Asia owner Tony Fernandes who&#x27;s arrival sparked a deadline day spending spree to strengthen the QPR squad. 

In January 2012, Fernandes sacked Warnock and appointed Mark Hughes as team manager. Following a tough start to his Loftus Road career and after a run of five straight home wins, Hughes and QPR escaped relegation despite a dramatic 3–2 defeat at Manchester City on the last day of the season.

On 23 November 2012, Mark Hughes was sacked after a poor start to the 2012–13 season, having amassed only four points in 12 games and with the club languishing at the bottom of the Premier League despite significant financial investment in new players in the 11 months of Hughes&#x27; tenure. A day later, Harry Redknapp was confirmed as the new manager. On 28 April 2013, in a 0–0 draw against fellow relegation rivals Reading, and with three games of the season to play, QPR were relegated from the Premier League down to the Championship after two seasons in the top flight.

During the 13–14 season, QPR finished fourth in the Championship, and qualified for the play-offs where they defeated Wigan Athletic in the semi-finals. In the final against favourites Derby County on 24 May 2014, QPR won 1–0 with a goal scored by Bobby Zamora in the 90th minute to return to the Premier League at the first time of asking.

Following promotion back to the Premier League, QPR endured a difficult 13-14 season. Harry Redknapp resigned in February after poor results and mutual frustration with the board. He was replaced by Chris Ramsey. The club finished the season in last place, amassing only 30 points, and were relegated back to the Championship after only one season. After a poor start to the following season, Ramsey was sacked in November 2015 and former manager Neil Warnock returned in interim charge. On 4 December 2015, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink was appointed the club&#x27;s new manager on a rolling contract. Hasselbaink was sacked on 5 November 2016, just 11 months after being in charge. Then six days later QPR reappointed Ian Holloway who was in charge ten years previously. Holloway&#x27;s second spell saw him focus on bringing through young players to replace some of the aging players in the squad on big wages. Holloway gave debuts to youth team players Eberechi Eze and Ilias Chair and made other youngers like Darnell Furlong, Ryan Manning and Bright Osayi-Samuel key members of the team. Results on the pitch were inconsistent under Holloway and the club finished lower midtable in both seasons of his second spell. Holloway left the club at the end of the 2017–18 season.

On 17 May 2018, QPR appointed former England manager Steve McClaren as manager. Despite a promising first half of the season in which the team sat as high as eighth by Christmas, results quickly tailed off following the turn of the year and McClaren was sacked in April 2019 after a 2–1 loss to Bolton.

On 8 May 2019, former Rangers &amp; Brentford manager Mark Warburton was appointed as McClaren&#x27;s successor on a two-year deal.

===Rebuilding Phase (2020s)===

The club continued to build on its development of young talent, with a focus on producing more homegrown players and challenged for promotion in each of Warburton&#x27;s three seasons in charge however failed to make the play-offs in any of these seasons. Warburton&#x27;s contract was not renewed after the 2021–22 season in which a disappointing end to the season saw Rangers drop out of the play-offs where they had spent the majority of the season and finishing 11th..

Ahead of the 2022–23 season, former Aston Villa assistant manager and Rangers first-team coach Michael Beale was appointed as manager on a three-year deal on 1 June 2022. A fortnight after pledging his loyalty to the club Beale was approached by Scottish club Rangers who appointed him manager in November 2022. On 11 December 2022, former Blackpool manager and Aston Villa assistant Neil Critchley was named QPR manager after signing a -year deal. However, after a dismal run of form and dropping to 20th in the EFL Championship, Neil Critchley was sacked after just 46 days in charge, leaving with the lowest win percentage of any manager in their history, winning one match from twelve. He was replaced by former player Gareth Ainsworth, signing from Wycombe Wanderers.

After a poor start to the 2023–24 season, Gareth Ainsworth was sacked with the club in 23rd place in the Championship, before being replaced by Martí Cifuentes. Despite spending much of the season in the relegation zone Cifuentes turned the teams fortunes around guiding them to Championship survival with a 4-0 home win over promotion contenders Leeds United.

==Grounds==
Queens Park Rangers have led a somewhat nomadic existence in their history. The several grounds used prior to 1886 are unknown but were probably in the Queen&#x27;s Park area of London (the first being &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Park&quot; itself). Thereafter, the club played at 15 different locations in west London and north-west London, but since joining the Football League in 1920, they have only played at two grounds: Loftus Road (briefly known as Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium between 2019 and 2022) and White City Stadium.

*Welford Fields (1886–1888)
*London Scottish Ground (1888–1889)
*Home Farm (1888–1889)
*Kensal Green (1888–1889)
*Gun Club (1888–1889)
*Wormwood Scrubs (1888–1889)
*Kilburn Cricket Ground (1888–1889)
*Barn Elms (1891)
*Kensal Rise Athletic Ground (1899–1901)
*Latimer Road (1901–1902)
*Kensal Rise Athletic Ground (1902–1904)
*Royal Agricultural Society showgrounds (1904–1907)
*Park Royal Ground (1907–1917)
*Loftus Road (1917–1931)
*White City Stadium (1931–1933)
*Loftus Road (1933–1962)
*White City Stadium (1962–1963)
*Loftus Road (1963 –present)
There were plans to build a new 40,000-seater stadium called New Queens Park; however, plans have been shelved with the club looking to build a stadium on the site of the Linford Christie Stadium with 30,000 seats. The club have argued this would bring a huge financial boost to the local area, but their plans were met with some initial scepticism by Hammersmith &amp; Fulham Council.

QPR have also been involved in a long-running legal battle to build a training ground at Warren Farm in Southall. In November 2018, Supreme Court judges rejected the final appeal from local objectors against the proposals, paving the way for the redevelopment of the site to begin. However the club formally abandoned plans for a training ground at Warren Farm on 6 May 2020 replacing it with a plan to develop the site into a community sports centre as the club signed a non-disclosure agreement with an unknown party regarding the freehold of another site. It was announced on 6 July that the club formally secured the freehold of the Heston Sports Ground from Imperial College, with the intention of developing the site into a training ground for the club, with discussions ongoing between the club and Hounslow Council.

On 31 March 2021, the club obtained planning permission for the redevelopment of Heston Sports Ground into a state of the art training ground, subject to a referral to the Secretary of State. The club received formal support from the Secretary of State on 27 September 2021 along with final planning permission from Hounslow Council being granted, with formal construction beginning on 1 October 2021. The Club aims to move into the £20m facility, (with £6.75m being raised through a bond scheme), by the start of the 2022–23 season, with the final competition date being the 2023–24 season.

In June 2019, the club gifted the stadium naming rights to The Kiyan Prince Foundation, a local charity set up by the father of Kiyan Prince. Prince was a former QPR youth player who was fatally stabbed in 2006. On 25 May 2022, the club announced that the stadium name would revert to Loftus Road ahead of the 2022–23 season.

==Supporters and rivalries==

QPR have a modest but loyal fanbase who come from across west London and the home counties. The club have supporters clubs across the world, including the Republic of Ireland, the US, Australia, Norway, and Sierra Leone. The club&#x27;s longest running fanzine is &quot;A Kick Up The R&#x27;s&quot;, which has been published every month since August 1987 and is sold at both home and away matches.

QPR have long-standing rivalries with several other clubs due to the club&#x27;s location in West London. The most notable of these is the West London derby against Chelsea. Other rivalries include Brentford, Cardiff City, Millwall, Fulham and Luton.

The most vocal QPR fans at home games can be found in the Q, P and R Blocks where fans often choose to stand and create the chants which the rest of the support in the Loft and the Stanley Bowles Stand follow.

===Songs and chants===
When the club won the League Cup final in 1967, the club released the single &quot;QPR – The Greatest&quot; about the famous win, which featured the vocals of Rangers winger Mark Lazarus.

As the team come onto the pitch at Loftus Road and when they score, the song Papa&#x27;s Got a Brand New Pigbag by post-punk band Pigbag is played, with the fans shouting &quot;HOOPS&quot; after the fifth trumpet toot.

At matches, Rangers fans sing chants such as &quot;Come On You Rs&quot;, &quot;We are the pride of West London, The Blue &amp; The White&quot;, &quot;Captain Jack&quot; and &quot;We Are the Rangers Boys&quot;.

===Famous fans===

QPR have a number of celebrity supporters, including comedian Bill Bailey, musicians Pete Doherty (who used to write a QPR fanzine entitled &quot;All Quiet on the Western Avenue&quot;), Ian Gillan of Deep Purple, Robert Smith of The Cure, Mick Jones of The Clash and Glen Matlock of The Sex Pistols; politicians Michael Gove and Alan Johnson; actor Martin Clunes and documentary-maker Louis Theroux, and former England cricketer Alex Tudor.

===Ownership and finances===

British music, media and sport entrepreneur Chris Wright bought QPR in 1996, eventually relinquishing his majority shareholding in 2001 having ploughed £20 million into Loftus Road over the previous five years; the club struggled financially and went into administration that same year. Following lengthy negotiations in December 2004, Wright agreed to sell his remaining 15% stake; 50% of the money paid to him was given back to QPR, which was significant amount of cash to the club.

After a number of years of financial difficulties which included a period in financial administration, QPR was bought by Formula One tycoons and multi-millionaires Bernie Ecclestone and Flavio Briatore in a £14 million takeover in August 2007. In spending £690,000 to acquire a 69% majority stake in the club from a Monaco-based consortium led by Italian football agent, Antonio Caliendo, Ecclestone spent £150,000 on his 15%, while Briatore bought 54% for £540,000 through a British Virgin Islands registered company, Sarita Capital. In addition, Briatore and Ecclestone were believed to have promised £5 million in convertible loan facilities to help buy players and have covered £13 million of debt, in a total commitment to the club of around £20 million. At the time of purchase, the remaining 31% of shareholders turned down the offer of 1p a share.

On 20 December 2007, it was announced that the family of billionaire Lakshmi Mittal had purchased a 20% shareholding in the club from Flavio Briatore. The purchase price of the 20% stake was just £200,000. As part of the investment Lakshmi Mittal&#x27;s son-in-law Amit Bhatia took a place on the board of directors. While Gianni Paladini remained chairman of the football club, Alejandro Agag, as chairman of QPR Holdings (the parent company) was the de facto chairman, until he was replaced by Flavio Briatore in early February 2008. Agag moved into the role of managing director, supported by a deputy managing director, Ali Russell, who moved from Hearts in the Scottish Premier League.

Despite QPR&#x27;s perilous financial condition in 2007–08, the combined personal wealth of the club&#x27;s new owners – which included the then world&#x27;s eighth richest man, Lakshmi Mittal – sparked speculation that QPR would receive significant further investment from their new benefactors, drawing parallels with their wealthy West London neighbours Chelsea and Fulham. However, no significant further funds were made available to the club other than those injected as part of the purchase of its share capital, and much of the subsequent player transfer activity involved loan acquisitions or free transfers. Indeed, it was reported in January 2008 that the investors had not discharged the £10 million loan from ABC Corporation – secured on the club&#x27;s stadium – together with its £1 million annual interest burden—despite the club&#x27;s prospective annual turnover of between £10 million and £15 million. Furthermore, around £2 million was still owed to former director and major shareholder, Antonio Caliendo, who waived £4.5 million of loans when Briatore and Ecclestone bought the club. It was expected that the ABC loan would be discharged in June 2008 on its maturity and that the debt owed to Caliendo would be paid off &quot;in early 2008&quot; in line with a funding strategy which Ecclestone publicly stated would not result in the wealthy owners simply bankrolling the club. In fact, the ABC loan was discharged on or around 31 July 2008.

Mittal&#x27;s investment is thought to be primarily motivated by his son-in-law&#x27;s interests and it was assumed that Mittal himself would remain a silent investor while Briatore, Ecclestone and Bhatia worked together to implement the strategy of slowly building the club up ahead of a push for promotion to the Premier League in 2009. The new owners also pledged to refurbish Loftus Road and use their experience in Formula One to increase sponsorship revenues. On 25 March 2008, QPR confirmed that, from the 2008–09 season and for five seasons, their kits would be supplied by Lotto Sport Italia as part of a number of new partnerships formed by Flavio Briatore. The investment potential of the club&#x27;s new backers resulted in a number of wildly speculative storylines in the football press throughout the 2007–08 season, including rumoured signings of former World Player of the Year winners Luís Figo and Zinedine Zidane, the latter as a possible manager.

In May 2008, billionaire Vijay Mallya was linked with buying into the club, as part of the Ecclestone, Briatore and Mittal consortium. Following the termination of the club&#x27;s sponsorship deals with Car Giant, Le Coq Sportif and Sellotape at the end of the 2007–08 season, in early July 2008 it was expected to be announced that Gulf Air would be the new shirt sponsors for three years. Further sponsorship packages were also announced, including Abbey Financial Services and Lotto Sport Italia. On 12 September 2011, Malaysia Airlines and AirAsia announced sponsorship of QPR&#x27;s shirts for the two seasons, with the sponsorship costing some £6.2 million.
Flavio Briatore&#x27;s future as QPR chairman came into question in September 2009 after he left the Renault F1 team in the midst of race fixing allegations. The Football League board discussed the matter on 8 October 2009 and declared that they would be awaiting a response from Briatore to various questions before commenting further. Meanwhile, the club continued to make losses (£18.8m in 2008–09 and £13.7m 2009–10). Briatore sold his 62% share to Ecclestone in December 2010, with the Italian possibly retaining a right of first refusal should Ecclestone sell, and initially stepped back from the day-to-day running of the business in favour of Amit Bhatia and Ishan Saksena, the company chairman and managing director respectively. However, his involvement gradually returned, and conflicts between Briatore on the one hand and Bhatia and Saksena on the other resulted in both Bhatia and Saksena leaving QPR in May 2011.

On 18 August 2011, Malaysian businessman Tony Fernandes was unveiled as the majority shareholder after having bought out Ecclestone&#x27;s 66 per cent stake in the club for a rumoured fee of around £35 million, while the Mittal Family retained their 33% stake. Amit Bhatia was restored to his position as vice-chairman. Phillip Beard was announced as the new chief executive of the club and Gianni Paladini removed as club chairman. Briatore and Ecclestone were no longer involved with the club, with no board representation or other financial ties. Bhatia also explained in the takeover announcement that the loan, representing the refinanced ABC Corporation debt secured using the stadium as collateral, had now been &quot;bought off&quot; by the new regime – that is, refinanced by new debt. It is thought that the current debt is represented by a shareholder loan to the club and is non-interest-bearing. Despite the club&#x27;s fortunes in attracting investors, it continues to be mired in controversy from previous ownership regimes and has been subject to proceedings from former investors Carlos Dunga and Antonio Caliendo.

On 15 August 2018, Bhatia took over as chairman of the club. On 10 July 2023, Fernandes announced that he is disposing all of his shares in the club to focus on rebuilding his airline business.

<text>Tom Swift Jr. is the central character in a series of over thirty science fiction adventure novels for male adolescents, following in the tradition of the earlier Tom Swift (&quot;Senior&quot;) novels. The series was titled &quot;The New Tom Swift Jr. Adventures&quot;. Unlike the Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys titles that were also products of the prolific Stratemeyer Syndicate, the original Tom Swift stories were not rewritten in the 1950s to modernize them. It was decided that the protagonist of the new series would be the son of the earlier Tom Swift and his wife, Mary Nestor Swift; the original hero continued as a series regular, as did his pal Ned Newton. The covers were created by illustrator J. Graham Kaye. Covers in the later half of the series were mostly by Charles Brey. A total of 33 volumes were eventually published.

For the Tom Swift Jr. series the books were outlined mostly by Harriet (Stratemeyer) Adams, head of the Stratemeyer Syndicate, attributed to the pseudonymous Victor Appleton II, and published in hardcover by Grosset &amp; Dunlap. Most of the books (Titles #5-#7 and #9-#30) were written by James Duncan Lawrence, who had an interest in science and technology and was faithful to the canon of the previous Tom Swift series. Title #7, &quot;Tom Swift and His Diving Seacopter&quot;, has several references to the first series, including a visit with Mrs. Baggert, who was Tom Sr.&#x27;s housekeeper,
and other volumes feature a rocket named after the old family retainer Eradicate &quot;Rad&quot; Sampson, a radiation-detector (the Damonscope) named after Tom Sr.&#x27;s friend Mr. Damon,
and a planetoid named in honor of Tom Swift Sr.&#x27;s father Barton. As in the original series, the basic locale is the quaint town of Shopton, New York, on Lake Carlopa.

Typical story elements include Tom&#x27;s loyal and quip-prone friend Bud Barclay, his comic-relief cook &quot;Chow&quot; Winkler, a spy (typically from Soviet stand-ins Brungaria or Kranjovia), use of a wonder-material called Tomasite that did anything the story needed, the amazingly versatile force-ray repelatron, and atomic-powered everything, including the atomicar. The first invention of the series and the one making the most frequent appearances in subsequent stories, the Flying Lab (named &quot;Sky Queen&quot;), was a giant VTOL research airplane the size of a Boeing 747 jumbo jet.

The Tom Swift Jr. stories had stronger science-fiction elements than the earlier series, particularly in the later volumes. One subplot, beginning on the first page of the first volume and running the length of the series, is Tom&#x27;s communication, via mathematical &quot;space symbols&quot;, with beings from &quot;Planet X&quot;. This mystery is never completely resolved, despite the beings sending a sample of life forms from their planet in book #7 and an artificial &quot;energy brain&quot; to occupy a robot body built by Tom in book #17 (see illustration above).

The stories offered science that was more intriguing than accurate. Yet the characters and titles are well-remembered and lovingly regarded, and Apple&#x27;s Steve Wozniak claims to have been inspired onto his career path by Tom Swift Jr.

==Regular characters from &quot;The New Tom Swift Jr. Adventures&quot; series==
*Tom Swift Jr. — The son of Tom Swift Sr. (see below). He is 18 years of age throughout the run of the series, and is described as lanky, blond, crew-cut, possessed of deep-set blue eyes, and closely resembling his famous father. Virtuous, brave, and very &quot;very&quot; smart. Typically depicted in illustrations as wearing a blue-striped T-shirt and slacks, even under the sea.
*Tom Swift Sr. — The protagonist of the previous series, now married to his longtime sweetheart, Mary. Tom Sr., unlike his own father, is still relatively young and vital at the time of Tom Jr.&#x27;s adventures and frequently assists his son from behind the scenes while operating the huge family business, Swift Enterprises.
*Mary Nestor Swift — Tom Sr.&#x27;s wife and the mother of Tom Jr. and Sandra. An occasionally fretful, attractive homebody, known for her cooking. Never joins the menfolk on their adventures.
*Sandra &quot;Sandy&quot; Swift — Tom&#x27;s year-younger sister. Sandy is pert and blond, also headstrong and brave. She is not quite as scientifically focused as her famed brother, toward whom she is less than reverent, though she clearly idolizes him. A trained pilot and aircraft demonstrator.
*Bud Barclay — Tom&#x27;s best friend, who accompanies Tom on all his adventures. Utterly devoted, and a dependable quipster and sometimes prankster, he is a highly qualified pilot in his own right. He is black-haired, the same age as his pal though a bit shorter and huskier, described as &quot;a natural athlete who likes to play for fun.&quot; Bud&#x27;s knowledge of science and engineering is rudimentary, prompting many an explanation by Tom (and thus helpful exposition for the reader). By dating Sandy, he keeps his social life within the world of the Swift family.
*&quot;Uncle&quot; Ned Newton — Tom Sr.&#x27;s pal from the previous series and father of Phyllis Newton 
*Phyllis Newton — Daughter of Ned Newton and Tom Jr.&#x27;s customary social date. Facing death, Tom Jr. declares his love for Phyllis in &quot;Tom Swift on the Phantom Satellite&quot;.
*Charles &quot;Chow&quot; Winkler — A comic relief character, successor to both Mr. Damon and Rad Sampson. A roly-poly &quot;former chuckwagon cook&quot; born in Texas, he is an older man, beloved for his gaudy western shirts, cowboy hats, bizarre culinary concoctions (like armadillo stew), and for such expressions as &quot;Brand my space biscuits!&quot;. He accompanies all Swift expeditions — even in outer space — as the Swifts&#x27; executive chef.

The series also offers a good many recurring characters of lesser rank, in contrast to the original series. Most are Swift Enterprises employees, such as Harlan Ames, Phil Radnor, Hank Sterling, Arvid Hanson, Slim Davis, George Dilling, Art Wiltessa, and Miss Trent — the two Toms&#x27; office secretary and the lone female among recurring Swift Enterprises characters.

The first 18 titles were released in a blue tweed cloth cover with a full color paper jacket. Volumes 1–18 were also published in a blue-spined picture cover edition with &quot;Tom Swift and the Electronic Hydrolung&quot; (in its first printing only) the only title with the picture cover imprinted directly on the &quot;boards&quot; and wrapping around the spine, rather than as a removable dust jacket. The &quot;blue spine&quot; editions lasted about a year and then the entire run of Tom Swift Jr. books was reproduced in yellow spine versions and all later titles were released in this format. The Hardy Boys books (another series from the Stratemeyer Syndicate) was also released in a blue spine version; this may have prompted the change in color.

A few of the early titles of the Tom Swift Jr. series were re-released in the 1970s in paperback with new illustrations. In 1972, four (#14, #15, #16, and #17) were released as trade paperbacks. #14 was retitled &quot;Tom Swift in the Jungle of the Mayas&quot; and #15 was renamed &quot;Tom Swift and the City of Gold&quot;. In 1977, six (#1–4, #6, and #8) were released as mass market paperbacks. One of the stories, #6 &quot;Tom Swift and His Outpost in Space&quot; was renamed &quot;Tom Swift and His Sky Wheel&quot; and repositioned as #5.

There exist a number of foreign reprints of Tom Swift Jr. titles, including British, Japanese, Icelandic, and Dutch (#1-3, adapted by the Dutch author Willy van der Heide). There is also a Tom Swift Jr. activity/coloring book and a rare Tom Swift Jr. board game. One episode of the &quot;Tom Swift/Linda Craig Mystery&quot; hour was aired in 1983, the only one of several proposed Tom Swift versions (including an elaborate &quot;road show&quot; movie) to actually appear before the public. The televised &quot;Tom Swift&quot; was unrelated to the character as depicted in any of the published series.

==Reception==
Criticism similar to that of the Nancy Drew Mysteries was leveled by writers Anthony Boucher and J. Francis McComas, who found the first installments of the series &quot;a most misguided venture, well below juvenile TV or comic book average in crudity of prose, construction, character and ideas.&quot; Nonetheless, the series sold a respectable 6 million copies in its 17-year run, and spawned at least four subsequent &quot;Tom Swift&quot; series.

<doc id="84591" wikidata="Q57351" url="?curid=84591" title="Ernst Moritz Arndt">
<text>Ernst Moritz Arndt (26 December 1769 – 29 January 1860) was a German nationalist historian, writer and poet. Early in his life, he fought for the abolition of serfdom, later against Napoleonic dominance over Germany. Arndt had to flee to Sweden for some time due to his anti-French positions. He is one of the main founders of German nationalism during the Napoleonic wars and the 19th century movement for German unification. After the Carlsbad Decrees, the forces of the restoration counted him as a demagogue.

Arndt played an important role for the early national and liberal Burschenschaft movement and for the unification movement, and his song &quot;Was ist des Deutschen Vaterland?&quot; acted as an unofficial German national anthem.

Long after his death, his anti-French propaganda was used again, in both World Wars. This, together with some strongly antisemitic and anti-Polish statements, has led to a highly critical view of Arndt today.

==Early life and studies==
Arndt was born at Gross Schoritz (now a part of Garz on the island of Rügen), then in Swedish Pomerania. He was the son of a prosperous farmer and emancipated serf of the lord of the district, Count Putbus. His mother came of well-to-do German yeoman stock. In 1787 the family moved to Stralsund, where Arndt was able to attend the academy. After an interval of private study he went in 1791 to the University of Greifswald as a student of theology and history, and in 1793 moved to Jena, where he came under the influence of the German idealist philosopher Gottlieb Fichte.

After the completion of his university studies he returned home, and for two years was a private tutor in the family of Ludwig Koscgarten (1758–1818), pastor of Wittow on Rügen, and having qualified for the ministry as a candidate of theology, he assisted in church services. In 1800, he started teaching history at Greifswald.

At the age of 28 he renounced the ministry, and for 18 months led a life of traveling, visiting Austria, Hungary, Italy, France and Belgium. Turning homewards up the river Rhine, he was moved by the sight of the ruined castles along its banks to intense bitterness against France. The impressions of this journey he later described in &quot;Travels in parts of Germany, Hungary, Italy and France in 1798 and 1799&quot;.

==Opposition to serfdom and Napoleonic rule==

Originally a supporter of the ideas of the French revolution, Arndt dissociated himself from them when the Reign of Terror of the Jacobins became apparent. When Napoleon began to conquer Europe, this renunciation was transformed into visceral dislike.

In 1800 he taught at the University of Greifswald as an independent lecturer (&quot;privatdocent&quot;) in history, and the same year published &quot;Über die Freiheit der alten Republiken&quot;. &quot;Germanien und Europa&quot; appeared in 1803, a &quot;fragmentary outburst,&quot; as he himself called it, on his views on French aggression. This was followed by one of his most influential books, &quot;Geschichte der Leibeigenschaft in Pommern und Rügen&quot; (Berlin, 1803), a history of serfdom in Pomerania and on Rügen, which was so convincing an indictment that King Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden in 1806 abolished serfdom.

Arndt had meanwhile risen from &quot;privatdocent&quot; to extraordinary professor, and in 1806 was appointed to the chair of history at the university. In this year he published the first part of his &quot;Geist der Zeit&quot;, in which he flung down the gauntlet to Napoleon and called on countrymen to rise and shake off the French yoke. So great was the excitement it produced that Arndt was compelled to take refuge in Sweden to escape the vengeance of Napoleon. Settling in Stockholm, he obtained government employment, and devoted himself to the great cause which was nearest his heart. In pamphlets, poems and songs, he communicated his enthusiasm for German independence to his countrymen. Schill&#x27;s heroic death at Stralsund prompted him to return to Germany, and in disguise he reached Berlin in December.
In 1810 he returned to Greifswald, but only for a few months. He again set out on his adventurous travels, lived in close contact, with notable men of his time, such as Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher, August von Gneisenau and Heinrich Friedrich Karl Stein, and in 1812 was summoned by the last named to St Petersburg to assist in the organization of the final struggle against France. Meanwhile, pamphlet after pamphlet, and his stirring patriotic songs, such as &quot;Was ist des Deutschen Vaterland?&quot;, &quot;Der Gott, der Eisen wachsen ließ,&quot; and &quot;Was blasen Trompeten?&quot; became widely popular. Composers such as Pauliine Volkstein also set his texts to music.

When, after the peace, the University of Bonn was founded in 1818, Arndt was appointed to teach from his &quot;Geist der Zeit&quot;, in which he criticized the particularist policies of the German principalities. The boldness of his demands for reform offended the Prussian government, and in the summer in 1819 he was arrested and his papers confiscated. Although speedily liberated, he was in the following year, at the behest of the Central Commission of Investigation at Mainz – established in accordance with the reactionary Carlsbad Decrees – arraigned before a special tribunal. Although not found guilty, he was forbidden to exercise the functions of his professorship, although he was allowed to retain the stipend. The next 20 years he passed in retirement and literary activity.

In 1840 he was reinstated in his professorship, and in 1841 was chosen rector of the university. The revolutionary outbreak of 1848 rekindled in the venerable patriot his old hopes and energies, and he took seat as one of the deputies to the National Assembly at Frankfurt. He participated in the deputation that offered the Imperial crown to Frederick William IV, and was indignant at the king&#x27;s refusal to accept it, so he retired from public life. He continued to lecture and to write with freshness and vigor, and on his 90th birthday received from all parts of Germany good wishes and tokens of affection. He died at Bonn in January 1860, and was buried in Bonn&#x27;s &quot;Alter Friedhof&quot;. There are monuments to his memory at Schoritz on Rügen, at the University of Greifswald, and in Bonn.

Arndt was married twice, first in 1800, his wife dying in the following year; a second time in 1817. His youngest son drowned in the Rhine in 1834.

==Ethnocentrism and attitude towards different ethnicities==

Like Fichte and Jahn, Arndt began to envision the German nation as a society of ethnic homogeneity, drawing on the history of the German people, especially in the Middle Ages. His writings lack a specific political program, but instead cite external enemies. While &quot;freedom&quot; is often mentioned, the freedom Arndt envisioned was not that of a pluralistic society, but rather of a romanticized national community. The French are denigrated as weakened, womanish and morally depraved, while supposed German virtues are extolled.


These ideas led Arndt to generate anti-French propaganda during the Napoleonic conquest of the German states:
Arndt also was prejudiced against Poles and other Slavs, and published an anti-Polish pamphlet in 1831 in which he castigated Polish &quot;barbarity and wildness&quot;. During the liberal Revolution of 1848, when the issue of reviving the Polish state was raised in Frankfurt, Arndt declared that &quot;tribes&quot; of Slavs and Wends &quot;have never done or been able to do anything lasting with respect to state, science, or art,&quot; and concluded: &quot;At the outset I assert with world history that pronounces judgment [that] the Poles and the whole Slavonic tribe are inferior to Germans.&quot;

He also warned of close contact with Judaism. He warned of the &quot;thousands [of Jews] which by the Russian tyranny will now come upon us even more abounding from Poland&quot; – &quot;the impure flood from the East&quot;. Moreover, he warned of a Jewish intellectual conspiracy, claiming that Jews had &quot;usurped&quot; half of literature.

Arndt paired his antisemitism with his anti-French views, calling the French &quot;the Jewish people&quot; (&quot;das Judenvolk&quot;), or &quot;refined bad Jews&quot; (&quot;verfeinerte schlechte Juden&quot;). In 1815 he wrote of the French: &quot;Jews... I call them again, not only for their Jewish lists and their penny-pinching avarice, but even more because of their Jew-like sticking together.&quot;

<text>In Greek mythology, Cynortas (, ) or Cynortes (, ) or Cynortus was a king of Sparta.

== Family ==
Cynortas was the son of King Amyclas of Sparta and Queen Diomede, and thus brother to King Argalus, Hyacinthus, Laodamia (or Leanira), Hegesandre, Harpalus, Polyboea and in other versions, of Daphne. He was the father of Oebalus or of Perieres, who either succeeded to the throne.

== Mythology ==
After the death of his brother Argalus, Cynortes inherited the kingdom and eventually became the king of Sparta. He is presumed to have participated in Pelops&#x27; attack on Oenomaus in 1312 BC. His tomb was shown near Scias at Sparta.

<text>Clemens Wenzeslaus Brentano (also Klemens; pseudonym: Clemens Maria Brentano ; ; 9 September 1778 – 28 July 1842) was a German poet and novelist, and a major figure of German Romanticism. He was the uncle, via his brother Christian, of Franz and Lujo Brentano.

==Biography==
Clemens Brentano was born to Peter Anton Brentano and Maximiliane von La Roche, a wealthy merchant family in Frankfurt on 9 September 1778. His father&#x27;s family was of Italian descent. His maternal grandmother was Sophie von La Roche. His sister was writer Bettina von Arnim, who, at a young age, lionised and corresponded with Goethe, and, in 1835, published the correspondence as &quot;Goethes Briefwechsel mit einem Kinde&quot; (Goethe&#x27;s correspondence with a child). Clemens Brentano studied in Halle and Jena, afterwards residing at Heidelberg, Vienna and Berlin. He was close to Wieland, Herder, Goethe, Friedrich Schlegel, Fichte and Tieck.

From 1798 to 1800 Brentano lived in Jena, the first center of the romantic movement. In 1801, he moved to Göttingen, and became a friend of Achim von Arnim. He married writer Sophie Mereau on 29 October 1803. In 1804, he moved to Heidelberg and worked with Arnim on &quot;Zeitungen für Einsiedler&quot; and &quot;Des Knaben Wunderhorn&quot;. After his wife Sophie died in 1806 he married a second time in 1807 to Auguste Bussmann (whose half-sister, Marie de Flavigny, later by marriage the Countess Marie d&#x27;Agoult, would become the companion of pianist and composer Franz Liszt). In the years between 1808 and 1818, Brentano lived mostly in Berlin, and from 1819 to 1824 in Dülmen, Westphalia.

In 1818, weary of his somewhat restless and unsettled life, he returned to the practice of the Catholic faith and withdrew to the monastery of Dülmen, where he lived for some years in strict seclusion. He took on there the position of secretary to the Catholic visionary nun, the Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich.

It was claimed that from 1802 until her death she bore the wounds of the Crown of Thorns, and from 1812 the full stigmata, a cross over her heart and the wound from the lance. Clemens Brentano made her acquaintance in 1818 and remained at the foot of the stigmatist&#x27;s bed copying her dictation until 1824. When she died, he prepared an index of the visions and revelations from her journal, &quot;The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ&quot; (published 1833). One of these visions made known by Brentano later resulted in the identification of the putative House of the Virgin Mary in Ephesus by Abbé Julien Gouyet, a French priest, during 1881. However, some posthumous investigations in 1923 and 1928 made it uncertain how much of the books he attributed to Emmerich were actually his own creation and the works were discarded for her beatification process.

The latter part of his life he spent in Regensburg, Frankfurt and Munich, actively engaged in promoting the Catholic faith. Brentano assisted Ludwig Achim von Arnim, his brother-in-law, in the collection of folk-songs forming &quot;Des Knaben Wunderhorn&quot; (1805–1808), which Gustav Mahler drew upon for his song cycle. In 1835, Swiss painter Emilie Linder, painted the famous portrait of him. He died in Aschaffenburg.

Brentano, whose early writings were published under the pseudonym Maria, belonged to the Heidelberg group of German romantic writers, and his works are marked by excess of fantastic imagery and by abrupt, bizarre modes of expression. His first published writings were &quot;Satiren und poetische Spiele&quot; (Leipzig, 1800), a romance &quot;Godwi oder Das steinerne Bild der Mutter&quot; (2 vols., Frankfort, 1801), and a musical drama &quot;Die lustigen Musikanten&quot; (Frankfort, 1803). Of his dramas the best are &quot;Ponce de Leon&quot; (1804), &quot;Victoria und ihre Geschwister&quot; (Berlin, 1817) and &quot;Die Grundung Prags&quot; (Pesth, 1815).

On the whole his finest work is the collection of &quot;Romanzen vom Rosenkranz&quot; (published posthumously in 1852); his short stories, and more especially the charming &quot;Geschichte vom braven Kasperl und dem schönen Annerl&quot; (1817), which has been translated into English, were very popular.

Brentano&#x27;s collected works, edited by his brother Christian, appeared at Frankfurt in 9 vols. (1851–1855). Selections have been edited by J. B. Diel (1873), M. Koch (1892), and J. Dohmke (1893). See J. B. Diel and William Kreiten, &quot;Klemens Brentano&quot; (2 vols, 1877–1878), the introduction to Koch&#x27;s edition, and R. Steig, &quot;A. von Arnim und K. Brentano&quot; (1894).

In his honor the Clemens Brentano prize is awarded for German literature.

==Musical settings and cultural references==
Richard Strauss set six poems by Brentano in &quot;Sechs Lieder&quot;, Op. 68, in 1918, which are also known as his Brentano Lieder.

Brentano&#x27;s work is referenced in Thomas Mann&#x27;s novel &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot;. A cycle of thirteen songs, based on Brentano&#x27;s poems, is noted in Chapter XXI as one of the composer protagonist&#x27;s most significant early works.

<text>In Greek mythology, the Oenotropae (, &quot;the women who change (into) wine&quot;) or Oenotrophae (, the &quot;Winegrowers&quot;) were the three daughters of Anius and Dryope.

== Names ==
The Oenotropae included: Spermo (, &quot;seed&quot;), who produced grain; Oeno or Oino (, &quot;wine&quot;), who produced wine; and Elais (, &quot;olive tree&quot;), who produced olive oil.

== Mythology ==
According to the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, their great-grandfather was Dionysus, and he gave them the power to change water into wine, grass into wheat, and berries into olives. For this reason no one around them ever had to starve. According to other sources, however, the daughters were devotees of Dionysus, and the god rewarded them with the extraordinary ability to produce oil, grain, and wine from the ground or merely by touch.

When the Greek fleet set out to make war in Troy, it was the Oenotropae who stocked their ships, and Agamemnon was so impressed with this that he abducted them in order to feed the Greek army. The daughters escaped, but their brother betrayed them again to the Greeks. As they were about to be bound, however, Dionysus saved them by turning them into white doves.

<doc id="84604" wikidata="Q486698" url="?curid=84604" title="Omphale">
<text>In Greek mythology, Omphale (; ) was princess of the kingdom of Lydia in Asia Minor. Diodorus Siculus provides the first appearance of the Omphale theme in literature, though Aeschylus was aware of the episode. The Greeks did not recognize her as a goddess: the undisputed etymological connection with &quot;omphalos&quot;, the world-navel, has never been made clear. In her best-known myth, she is the mistress of the hero Heracles during a year of required servitude, a scenario that, according to some, offered writers and artists opportunities to explore sexual roles and erotic themes.

== Family ==
According to Diodorus Siculus, Omphale was the daughter of Iardanus while according to the mythographer Apollodorus, the name of her father was Iardanes, and she was the wife of Tmolus, a king of Lydia from whom she inherited his throne.

== Mythology ==

===Heracles and Omphale===
 |Heracles and Omphale, Roman fresco, Pompeian Fourth Style (45-79 AD), Naples National Archaeological Museum, Italy
In one of many Greek variations on the theme of penalty for &quot;inadvertent&quot; murder, for his murder of Iphitus, the great hero Heracles, whom the Romans identified as Hercules, was, by the command of the Delphic Oracle Xenoclea, remanded as a slave to Omphale for the period of a year, the compensation to be paid to Eurytus, who refused it. (According to Diodorus, Iphitus&#x27; sons accepted it.)

The theme, inherently a comic inversion of sexual roles, is not fully illustrated in any surviving text from Classical Greece. Plutarch, in his life of Pericles, 24, mentions lost comedies of Kratinos and Eupolis, which alluded to the contemporary capacity of Aspasia in the household of Pericles, and to Sophocles in &quot;The Trachiniae&quot; 

it was shameful for Heracles to serve an Oriental woman in this fashion, but there are many late Hellenistic and Roman references in texts and art to Heracles being forced to do women&#x27;s work and even wear women&#x27;s clothing and hold a basket of wool while Omphale and her maidens did their spinning. Omphale even wore the skin of the Nemean Lion and carried Heracles&#x27; olive-wood club. No full early account survives to supplement the later vase-paintings.

But it was also during his stay in Lydia that Heracles captured the city of the Itones and enslaved them, killed Syleus who forced passersby to hoe his vineyard, and then captured the Cercopes.

After some time, Omphale freed Heracles and took him as her husband. They travelled to the grove of Dionysus and planned to celebrate the rites of Bacchus at dawn. Heracles slept alone in a bed covered with the clothes of Omphale. The Greek god Pan hoped to have his way with Omphale and crept naked into the bed of Heracles who threw Pan to the floor and laughed.

===Sons of Heracles in Lydia===
Diodorus Siculus (4.31.8) and Ovid in his &quot;Heroides&quot; (9.54) mention a son named Lamos. But &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; (2.7.8) gives the name of the son of Heracles and Omphale as Agelaus, whom the family of Croesus was descended from.

Pausanias (2.21.3) gives yet another name, mentioning Tyrsenus, son of Heracles by &quot;the Lydian woman&quot;, by whom Pausanias presumably means Omphale. This Tyrsenus supposedly first invented the trumpet, and Tyrsenus&#x27; son Hegeleus taught the Dorians with Temenus how to play the trumpet and first gave to Athena the surname &quot;Trumpet&quot;.

The name &quot;Tyrsenus&quot; appears elsewhere as a variant of Tyrrhenus, whom many accounts bring from Lydia to settle the Tyrsenoi/ Tyrrhenians/ Etruscans in Italy. Dionysius of Halicarnassus (1.28.1) cites a tradition that the supposed founder of the Etruscan settlements was Tyrrhenus, the son of Heracles by Omphale the Lydian, who drove the Pelasgians out of Italy from the cities north of the Tiber river. Dionysius gives this as an alternate to other versions of Tyrrhenus&#x27; ancestry.

Herodotus (1.7) refers to a Heraclid dynasty of kings who ruled Lydia, yet were perhaps not descended from Omphale, writing, &quot;The Heraclids, descended from Heracles and the slave-girl of Iardanus...&quot; Omphale as slave-girl seems odd. However, Diodorus Siculus relates that when Heracles was still Omphale&#x27;s slave, before Omphale (daughter of Iardanus) set Heracles free and married him, Heracles fathered a son, Cleodaeus, on a slave-woman. This fits, though in Herodotus the son of Heracles and the slave-girl of Iardanus is named Alcaeus.

But according to the historian Xanthus of Lydia (5th century BC) as cited by Nicolaus of Damascus, the Heraclid dynasty of Lydia traced their descent to a son of Heracles and Omphale named Tylon, and were called Tylonidai. It is known from coins that this Tylon was a native Anatolian god equated with the Greek Heracles .

Herodotus asserts that the first of the Heraclids to reign in Sardis was Agron, the son of Ninus, son of Belus, son of Alcaeus, son of Heracles. Later writers know a Ninus who is the primordial king of Assyria, and they often call this Ninus son of Belus. Their Ninus is the legendary founder and eponym of the city of Ninus, referring to Ninevah, while Belus, though sometimes treated as a human, is identified with the god Bel.

An earlier genealogy may have made Agron, as a legendary first king of an ancient dynasty, to be a son of the mythical Ninus, son of Belus, and stopped at that point. In the genealogy given by Herodotus, someone may have grafted the tradition of a Lydian son of Heracles at the top end of it, so that Ninus and Belus in the list now become descendants of Heracles, who just happen to bear the same names as the more famous Ninus and Belus.

That, at least, is the interpretation of later chronologists who also ignored Herodotus&#x27; statement that Agron was the first to be a king, and included Alcaeus, Belus, and Ninus in their List of kings of Lydia.

As to how Agron gained the kingdom from the older dynasty descended from Lydus son of Atys, Herodotus only says that the Heraclids, &quot;having been entrusted by these princes with the management of affairs, obtained the kingdom by an oracle.&quot;

Strabo (5.2.2) makes Atys father of Lydus, and Tyrrhenus to be one of the descendants of Heracles and Omphale. But all other accounts place Atys, Lydus, and Tyrrhenus brother of Lydus among the pre-Heraclid kings of Lydia.

==In art==
* &quot;Omphale&quot; is an opera by the French composer André Cardinal Destouches, first performed at the Académie Royale de Musique (the Paris Opera) on 10 November 1701.
* One of the most famous symphonic poems in a mythological series composed by the French composer Camille Saint-Saëns in the 1870s is titled &quot;Le Rouet d&#x27;Omphale&quot; (&quot;The Spinning Wheel of Omphale&quot;) the &quot;rouet&quot; being a spinning wheel that the queen and her maidens used—in this version of the myth, it was Delphic Apollo who condemned the hero to serve the Lydian queen disguised as a woman. In the twentieth century, during the &quot;Golden Age of Radio&quot;, this symphonic poem gained wider public exposure when it was used as the theme music for &quot;The Shadow&quot;.
* &quot;Hercules and Omphale or The Power of Love&quot; is a &quot;classical extravaganza&quot; which premiered at Royal St. James&#x27;s Theatre in London on 26 December 1864. Written by William Brough, with music composed and arranged by Wallerstein, the piece was directed by Charles Matthews. Hercules was played &quot;en travesti&quot; by Charlotte Saunders (possibly Charlotte Cushman Saunders), with a Miss Herbert as Omphale.
* &quot;Hercules und Omphale&quot; is a painting by the sixteenth-century German painter Lucas Cranach the Elder. It features Hercules being dressed up as a woman by Omphale and two maids. Hercules is also spinning wool. 
* &quot;Hercules at the feet of Omphale&quot; is a painting by the French nineteenth-century painter Édouard Joseph Dantan. Hercules is depicted sitting at the feet of Omphale, spinning wool.
* &quot;Hercule et Omphale&quot; is a short, sexually explicit poem by the French poet Guillaume Apollinaire appearing in the erotic (and for many years forbidden) novel &quot;Les onze mille verges&quot; (&quot;The Eleven Thousand Penises&quot;).
* In August Strindberg&#x27;s &quot;The Father (1887)&quot;, the protagonist, Captain Adolf, likens his wife&#x27;s mistreatment of him to Omphale&#x27;s behavior toward Heracles. &quot;Omphale!&quot; He screams. &quot;It&#x27;s Queen Omphale herself! Now you play with Hercules&#x27; club while he spins your wool!&quot;

==In cinema==
Queen Omphale is a main character of &quot;Hercules Unchained&quot;, the sequel of &quot;Hercules&quot; (1958). Her guards capture males who drink from a fountain of forgetfulness one by one. She makes him her love slave, calls him the King, and then has him killed by her guards when they come with the next man. In Hercules&#x27;s quest to mediate the power struggle between Polynices and Eteocles, he drinks from the fountain and becomes captive to Omphale. His comrade, Ulysses (Odysseus), pretends to be deaf and mute in order to remain imprisoned on the island and stay in contact with Hercules, as opposed to being killed. He sneaks out of his cell one night to find a cave filled with preserved statues of Omphale&#x27;s previous love slaves. He continues to feed Hercules regular water, which eventually leads to Hercules regaining memory and escaping the island. Omphale ultimately commits suicide by jumping in the preservation bath when Hercules escapes.

<text>Although women have participated in boxing for almost as long as the sport has existed, female fights have been effectively outlawed for most of boxing&#x27;s history until recently, with athletic commissioners refusing to sanction or issue licenses to women boxers, and most nations officially banning the sport. Reports of women entering the ring go back to the 18th century.

== Historical overview ==

One of the earliest mentions of women&#x27;s boxing is in the travelogue of a German man who visited London in 1710. While taking in a men&#x27;s boxing match, he met a woman in the audience who claimed to have previously boxed another woman in the same venue.

One of the earliest known women&#x27;s boxing matches to have been advertised in print was in London between Elizabeth Wilkinson and Hannah Hyfield in 1722. Billing herself as the &quot;European Championess&quot;, Wilkinson and her husband would also fight other mixed couples as a pair, with Wilkinson fighting the other woman, and her husband fighting the other man. In those days, the rules of boxing allowed kicking, gouging and other methods of attack not part of today&#x27;s arsenal.

Women&#x27;s boxing first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1904, in St. Louis.

During the 1920s, Professor Andrew Newton formed a Women&#x27;s Boxing Club in London. However women&#x27;s boxing was hugely controversial. In early 1926, Shoreditch borough council banned an arranged exhibition match between boxers Annie Newton and Madge Baker, a student of Digger Stanley. An attempt to hold the match in nearby Hackney instead was defeated by a campaign led by the Mayor of Hackney, who wrote, &quot;I regard this proposed exhibition of women boxers as a gratification of the sensual ideals of a crowd of vulgar men.&quot; The Home Secretary Sir William Joynson-Hicks was among those opposing the match, claiming &quot;the Legislature never imagined that such a disgraceful exhibition would have been staged in this country.&quot; The story was reported across the country and even internationally.

In 1988 the Swedish Amateur Boxing Association sanctioned events for women.

In 1997 the British Amateur Boxing Association sanctioned its first boxing competition for women. The first event was meant to be between two thirteen-year-olds, but one of the boxers dropped out because of hostile media attention. A month later, an event was held between two sixteen-year-olds.

The British Boxing Board of Control refused to issue licenses to women until they issued one to Jane Couch in 1998. By the end of the century, however, they had issued five such licenses. The first sanctioned professional bout between women in the U.K. was in November 1998 at Streatham in London, between Jane Couch and Simona Lukic. Couch won.
The International Boxing Association (amateur) accepted new rules for women&#x27;s boxing at the end of the 20th century and approved the first European Cup for Women in 1999 and the first World Championship for women in 2001. In October 2001 the first women&#x27;s world amateur boxing championships, called the 2001 Women&#x27;s World Amateur Boxing Championships, were held in Scranton, in the United States.
Women&#x27;s boxing was not featured at the 2008 Olympics; however, on 14 August 2009, it was announced that the International Olympic Committee&#x27;s Executive Board (EB) had approved the inclusion of women&#x27;s boxing for the Games in London in the 2012 Olympics, contrary to the expectations of some observers. Around these (2009) hearings, in conjunction with AIBA (International Boxing Association), the International Olympic Committee agreed to include three additional women&#x27;s weight classes to the 2012 London Olympic Games. A new &quot;gender-appropriate&quot; women&#x27;s boxing uniform was being created at the time, which would have required women (under AIBA rules) to wear skirts during competition. The issue was widely ignored by the public until amateur boxer and London student Elizabeth Plank brought the issue to light. She created a petition at Change.com to end the gender-based mandatory uniforms. It was eventually decided (before the 2012 Olympics) to give women boxers the option of wearing shorts or a skirt.

Women were allowed to competitively box for the first time at the Olympics during the 2012 Summer Olympics, in London, producing the world&#x27;s first 12 female Olympic medalist boxers. Nicola Adams of Great Britain won the world&#x27;s first Olympic women&#x27;s boxing gold medal.

On 14 September 2014, after defeating Croatian Ivana Habazin, Cecilia Brækhus became the first Norwegian and the first woman to hold all major world championship belts in her weight division (welterweight) in boxing history.

In 2015 the World Boxing Federation unified various women&#x27;s titles to have one title holder.

In 2024, Cindy Ngamba became the first boxer chosen for the Refugee Olympic Team; later that year she became the first medalist for the Refugee Olympic Team at the Olympics, having won bronze in women’s 75 kg boxing at the 2024 Summer Olympics.

== Algeria ==
On 9 August 2024, Algerian boxer Imane Khelif defeated Yang Liu of China in the final to win an Olympic gold medal. Khelif therefore became Algeria&#x27;s first female gold medalist in boxing, as well as the country&#x27;s first boxer of any gender to win a medal since Mohamed Allalou in 2000 and the first to win a gold medal since Hocine Soltani in 1996.

Khelif had been disqualified from the 2023 Women&#x27;s World Boxing Championships organized by the Russian-led International Boxing Association (IBA) after failing unspecified gender eligibility tests, along with boxer Lin Yu-ting. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) and its Paris Boxing Unit criticized the disqualification as &quot;sudden and arbitrary&quot; and taken &quot;without any due process&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; stated, &quot;It remains unclear what standards Khelif and Lin Yu Ting failed [in 2023] to lead to the disqualifications.&quot; The IBA did not reveal the testing methodology, stating the &quot;specifics remain confidential&quot;. The IBA&#x27;s Olympic status was revoked in June 2023, due to governance issues and perceived judging and refereeing corruption.

== Argentina ==
In Argentina, women&#x27;s boxing has experienced a notable rise in popularity, due in part to the presence of boxers such as Alejandra Oliveras, Marcela Acuna, Yesica Bopp and Erica Farias.

== Australia ==
While not being urged to avoid competition, women had few opportunities to compete in sport in Australia until the 1880s. After that date, new sporting facilities were being built around the country and many new sport clubs were created. Boxing classes were being offered to women in Australia by 1892, at locations such as the Brisbane Gymnasium on Turbot Street, close to the city&#x27;s railway station. While classes may have been offered for women, serious training was not permitted for women by the 1900s and women were banned from pursuing the sport in a competitive way. Women were also barred from attending boxing matches. New South Wales banned women&#x27;s boxing from 1986 to 2009. Women&#x27;s boxing was resumed in NSW with an exhibition fight between Kaye Scott and Ramona Stephenson in October 2009. Women&#x27;s boxing was legalized in Queensland in 2000.

In 2002, Desi Kontos of South Australia became the first Australian woman to represent the country at the boxing world championships.

Naomi Fischer-Rasmussen was the first female boxer to represent Australia at the Olympics when she competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics.

Caitlin Parker became the first Australian female boxer to win an Olympic medal when she won bronze at the 2024 Summer Olympics.

== Canada ==
In 2023, women competed in boxing at the Canada Games for the first time. Talia Birch of Team Quebec and Emily Vigneault of Team Alberta won the first Canada Games gold medals for boxing in their divisions; Birch won in the 52-kg female division and Vigneault won in the 60-kg female division. Those were the only female divisions in boxing in the 2023 Canada Games.

== China ==
In 2024, Ruru Yang Sheau-ru became Hong Kong’s first woman professional boxer to win a world title, due to winning the Women’s International Boxing Association super bantamweight belt by defeating Tanwarat Saengiamjit from Thailand. The match was held in Bangkok.

Later that year, Chang Yuan defeated Turkish boxer Hatice Akbaş by 5-0 to win the gold medal in women&#x27;s 54 kg boxing at the 2024 Summer Olympics, which made Chang the first Chinese female boxer to win a gold medal at any Olympics.

==Cuba==
In 2022 women became allowed to participate officially in the sport of boxing in Cuba, for the first time since they were banned from doing so during the Revolution of Fidel Castro in 1959.

== Czech Republic ==
In 2018 Fabiana Bytyqi became the first female boxer from the Czech Republic to win a major world title, when she defeated Denise Castle to win the vacant WBC atomweight title. The fight took place at the Sportcentrum Sluneta in Ústí nad Labem, on 22 September 2018. She won the fight by unanimous decision, with two judges awarding her a 100–90 scorecard, while the third judge awarded her a 99–91 scorecard.

== Gaza Strip ==
In 2019 the first female boxing club in the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian Center of Boxing for Women, opened.

== Ghana ==
Sarah Lotus Asare, the first female boxing matchmaker licensed under the Ghana Boxing Authority, debuted as a matchmaker on August 26, 2023.

== India ==
Mary Kom of India is a five-time World Amateur Boxing champion. She is the only woman boxer to have won a medal in each one of the six world championships.

Three Indian female boxers, namely, Pinki Jangra, Mary Kom, and Kavita Chahal were placed in the world&#x27;s top three in AIBA world rankings (1 March 2014) in their respective categories.

== Iran ==
Sadaf Khadem defeated French boxer Anne Chauvin in a boxing match in France on April 14, 2019; this made her the first Iranian woman to be part of an official boxing match. However, the Iranian Boxing Federation distanced itself from the match and released a statement reading: As women&#x27;s boxing is not a sanctioned sport of the Islamic Republic of Iran Boxing Federation, the organization, training, and participation in this sport is not related to this federation and it is the organizer and participant&#x27;s responsibilities.Following the match, Khadem had plans to return to Iran, but lingering rumors of potential arrest warrants kept her in France. Khadem&#x27;s representative told Reuters that authorities had issued arrest warrants against her. Hossein Soori, the head of Iran&#x27;s boxing federation, denied Khadem would be arrested, attributing the information to “media linked to Saudi Arabia”.

== Ireland ==
In 1997, Deirdre Gogarty challenged Bonnie Canino for the Women&#x27;s International Boxing Federation&#x27;s Women&#x27;s World Featherweight Championship. Gogarty won, making her the first Irishwoman to win any boxing world title; the fight occurred in the United States.

In February 1999, Deirdre Nelson, from County Antrim, was granted a professional boxing licence by the British Boxing Board of Control, which gave her the right to box anywhere within the European Boxing Union. However, the Boxing Union of Ireland forbid her to box until guidelines on women’s boxing were issued by the European Boxing Union in September 1999. In 2001 Nelson won a sex discrimination case against the Boxing Union of Ireland due to this; she was awarded £1,500 in compensation. The Employment Equality Authority (based in Dublin) stated that the Boxing Union of Ireland had discriminated against Nelson, violating the Employment Equality Act of 1977.

In 2001, Irishwoman Katie Taylor won the first officially sanctioned female boxing match in Ireland, at the National Stadium, defeating Alanna Audley from Belfast. In 2012, the first year women competed in boxing at the Olympics, Katie Taylor won an Olympic gold medal in boxing; she was the first ever Olympic female lightweight champion. In 2023, she defeated Chantelle Cameron; this win made Taylor the second female boxer, and the first Irish female boxer, to be an undisputed champion in two weight classes; the first was the American female boxer Claressa Shields.

In 2020 and 2024, Kellie Harrington won a gold medal in boxing at the Olympics; this made her the first Irish boxer to win consecutive Olympic gold medals.

== Mexico ==
In 1998 Laura Serrano was supposed to fight in Mexico City, but the match was canceled due to a 1947 ban against women boxing in Mexico City. The ban was eventually ended. In 2015 Serrano became the first female Mexican boxer inducted into the International Women&#x27;s Boxing Hall of Fame.

In 2005 Mexican female boxer Jackie Nava became the first woman to win a female world title fight sanctioned by the WBC.

== Puerto Rico ==
In 2017, fighting on the Shawn Porter vs. Andre Berto undercard, Puerto Rican boxer Amanda Serrano dominated Dahiana Santana en route to an eighth-round KO victory to win the vacant World Boxing Organization bantamweight belt, which made her the first female boxer to win world titles in five weight divisions.

In 2024, Skye Nicolson of Australia defeated Raven Chapman of the United Kingdom in what was the first women&#x27;s world title boxing fight held in Saudi Arabia and the first women’s bout to be on a Riyadh Season show. She won by unanimous decision.

== Somalia ==
Ramla Ali was the first boxer to win an international gold medal while representing Somalia. Later, in 2021, she competed in the women&#x27;s featherweight event at the 2020 Summer Olympics. Although she lost her first fight, she became the first boxer ever to represent Somalia on the Olympic stage. In 2022, she defeated Dominican boxer Crystal Garcia Nova in the first professional women&#x27;s boxing match held in Saudi Arabia.

== South Korea ==
In 2024 Im Ae-ji became the first South Korean woman to win any Olympic medal in boxing; she won a bronze medal.

== Sweden ==
In 1988 the Swedish Amateur Boxing Association sanctioned events for women.

== Taiwan ==
Lin Yu-ting won an Olympic gold medal in boxing in 2024 after defeating Julia Szeremeta of Poland in the final of the women&#x27;s 57 kg category (featherweight). With this win, Lin became the first Taiwanese boxer to win an Olympic gold medal.

Lin had been disqualified from the 2023 Women&#x27;s World Boxing Championships organized by the Russian-led International Boxing Association (IBA) after failing unspecified gender eligibility tests, along with Algerian boxer Imane Khelif. She was stripped of a bronze medal, which was instead awarded to Bulgaria&#x27;s Svetlana Staneva. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) and its Paris Boxing Unit criticized the disqualification as &quot;sudden and arbitrary&quot; and taken &quot;without any due process&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; stated, &quot;It remains unclear what standards Khelif and Lin Yu Ting failed [in 2023] to lead to the disqualifications.&quot; The IBA did not reveal the testing methodology, stating the &quot;specifics remain confidential&quot;. The IBA&#x27;s Olympic status was revoked in June 2023, due to governance issues and perceived judging and refereeing corruption. Later in 2023, Lin competed at the Hangzhou Asian Games, where she won Taiwan&#x27;s first gold medal in boxing at the event.

== United Kingdom ==
One of the earliest mentions of women&#x27;s boxing is in the travelogue of a German man who visited London in 1710. While taking in a men&#x27;s boxing match, he met a woman in the audience who claimed to have previously boxed another woman in the same venue.

One of the earliest known fights to have been advertised in print was in London between Elizabeth Wilkinson and Hannah Hyfield in 1722. Billing herself as the &quot;European Championess&quot;, Wilkinson and her husband would also fight other mixed couples as a pair, with Wilkinson fighting the other woman and her husband, the other man. In those days, the rules of boxing allowed kicking, gouging and other methods of attack not part of today&#x27;s arsenal.

During the 1920s, Professor Andrew Newton formed a Women&#x27;s Boxing Club in London. However women&#x27;s boxing was hugely controversial. In early 1926, Shoreditch borough council banned an arranged exhibition match between boxers Annie Newton and Madge Baker, a student of Digger Stanley.

In 1997 the British Amateur Boxing Association sanctioned its first boxing competition for women. The first event was meant to be between two thirteen-year-olds, but one of the boxers dropped out because of hostile media attention. A month later, an event was held between two sixteen-year-olds.

Jane Couch became the first licensed female boxer in the United Kingdom in 1998. The British Boxing Board of Control initially refused to grant Couch a professional licence on the sole ground that she was a woman, and argued that PMS made women too unstable to box. Claiming sexual discrimination and supported by the Equal Opportunities Commission, Couch managed to have this decision overturned by a tribunal in March 1998. However, some criticism followed; the British Medical Association called this result &quot;a demented extension of equal opportunities&quot;. The first sanctioned professional boxing match between women in the U.K. was in November 1998 at Streatham in London, between Couch and Simona Lukic. Couch won.

In 2001, Nicola Adams became the first woman boxer ever to represent England, which she did in a fight against an Irish boxer. In 2007 she became the first English female boxer to win a medal in a major boxing tournament, taking silver in the European Championships. In 2008 she won a silver medal that was Britain’s first women’s world championship medal in women’s boxing.

In 2009 Natasha Jonas became the first female boxer to compete for GB Boxing.

Women were allowed to competitively box for the first time at the Olympics during the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, producing the world&#x27;s first 12 female Olympic medalist boxers. Representing Great Britain, Nicola Adams won the world’s first Olympic women&#x27;s boxing gold medal. This win also made her the first openly LGBT person to win an Olympic boxing gold medal.

At the 2014 Commonwealth Games, Lauren Price became the first Welsh woman to win a boxing medal in the Commonwealth Games, winning a bronze.

In 2019 English boxer Barbara Buttrick became one of the first three women boxers (and the first English woman boxer) elected to the International Boxing Hall of Fame; 2019 was the first year that women were on the ballot.

In 2021, Lauren Price became the first Welsh boxer of any gender to win an Olympic gold medal.

In 2022 two female boxers headlined at a major venue in the United Kingdom for the first time, which occurred at the O2 Arena. That fight was a title unification bout between Claressa Shields and Savannah Marshall. Shields won via unanimous decision with two judges scoring the fight 97–93 and one scoring it 96–94, all in favor of Shields to become the undisputed middleweight world champion. As well, the fight headlined the first all-female boxing card in the United Kingdom. Later in the year, Chantelle Cameron defeated Jessica McCaskill in a match held in Abu Dhabi, making Cameron the undisputed world light-welterweight champion and the United Kingdom&#x27;s first undisputed female boxing world champion.

Natasha Jonas won the British Boxing Board of Control’s 2022 British Boxer of the Year award, which made her the first woman to win the British Boxing Board of Control&#x27;s British Boxer of the Year Award.

On 6 May 2023, Lauren Price won the first British women&#x27;s title fight in professional boxing history, becoming the first female British welterweight champion and the first woman to receive a Lonsdale Belt, by defeating Kirstie Bavington by unanimous points victory.

In October 2023, Natasha Jonas became the first black woman to receive a manager&#x27;s license from the British Boxing Board of Control.

On 14 March 2024 it was announced that Lauren Price would challenge Jessica McCaskill for her WBA, IBO, and &quot;Ring&quot; female welterweight World titles on 11 May 2024 in Cardiff, Wales. Price won the contest by unanimous technical decision after an accidental clash of heads that took place in the fifth round caused an injury to McCaskill&#x27;s eye and she was ruled unable to continue at the start of round nine. This win made Price Wales’ first female professional boxing world champion.

== United States == 
In 1876, the first women&#x27;s boxing match was held in the United States. In this match Nell Saunders defeated Rose Harland. Her prize was a silver butter dish.

Women&#x27;s boxing first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1904, in St. Louis.

In 1954, Barbara Buttrick was part of the first boxing match between two women on American national television.

In 1975, Caroline Svendsen became the first woman to receive a boxing license in the United States when she was granted one in Nevada.

Also in 1975, Jackie Tonawanda sued the New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC) for denying her a boxing license because of her gender. This resulted in the case &quot;Garrett v. New York State Athletic Commission&quot; (1975) at the New York Supreme Court (Tonawanda was also known as Jacqueline Garrett) which was decided in her favor. However, this did not overturn the law in New York against women boxing. But Cathy Davis sued the New York State Athletic Commission in 1977 because she was denied a boxing license because she was a woman, and the case was decided in her favor later that year, with the judge
invalidating New York State rule number 205.15, which stated, “No woman may be licensed as a boxer or second or licensed to compete in any wrestling exhibition with men.” In his opinion the judge cited the precedent set by &quot;Garrett v. New York State Athletic Commission&quot; (1975), which “found the regulation invalid under the equal protection clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions”. The NYSAC filed an appeal of the ruling, but later dropped it. In August 1978 Cathy Davis became the first woman to be on the cover of &quot;The Ring&quot;. On September 19, 1978, Davis received the NYSAC&#x27;s first boxing license given to a female boxer.

In 1976, Pat Pineda became the first female boxer to be licensed in California.

In 1979, a lawsuit made California change its boxing regulations, which had limited women boxers to no more than four rounds.

During the 1980s, women&#x27;s boxing briefly resurfaced in public notice in California due to the twin sisters Dora and Cora Webber. They were world champions. Other women boxers went on hunger strikes to be noticed.

But the boom of women&#x27;s boxing came during the 1990s, coinciding with the boom in professional women sports leagues such as the WNBA and WUSA, and with boxers such as Stephanie Jaramillo, Delia &#x27;Chikita&#x27; Gonzalez, Christy Martin, Laila Ali, Jackie Frazier-Lyde, Bonnie Canino and Sumya Anani, all world champions, jumping into the scene.

On 16 April 1992, after eight years in court in Massachusetts, Gail Grandchamp won her battle to become a boxer, as a Massachusetts state Superior Court judge ruled it was illegal to deny someone a chance to box based on gender. During her battle to win the right to box as an amateur, she passed the age of 36, the maximum age for amateur fighters. Even though she knew it would not help her as an amateur, Grandchamp continued her efforts, and eventually did box professionally for a time.

Dallas Malloy was denied an application by USA Boxing due to being female. She sued and U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein allowed her to box by granting a preliminary injunction. In October 1993, Malloy defeated Heather Poyner in the United States&#x27; first sanctioned amateur boxing match between two female boxers. USA Boxing lifted its ban on women&#x27;s boxing later in 1993. When USA Boxing officially recognized women&#x27;s boxing in 1993, it became the first organization to do so in the world.

Also in 1993, Don King, the world-famous boxing promoter, signed American boxer Christy Martin in October, making Martin the first female boxer to sign with King.

In 1995, the New York Golden Gloves allowed women boxers to compete for the first time.

On March 16, 1996, a boxing match took place that is often called the fight that &quot;put women&#x27;s boxing on the map&quot;, or &quot;the bout that made women&#x27;s boxing&quot;. It was held in Nevada between American Christy Martin and Irishwoman Deirdre Gogarty. The fight was won by Martin, in a six rounds unanimous decision, and led to her featuring as the first female boxer on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; on April 15, 1996; the headline read, &quot;The Lady Is a Champ&quot;.

In October 2001 the first women&#x27;s world amateur boxing championships, called the 2001 Women&#x27;s World Amateur Boxing Championships, were held in Scranton, in the United States.
On April 2, 2005 Becky Zerlentes was participating in the Colorado State Boxing Senior Female Championships at the Denver Coliseum in Denver. She was knocked out in the third round by her opponent, Heather Schmitz, fell unconscious, and died without regaining consciousness. This made Zerlentes the first woman known to have died of injuries sustained during a sanctioned boxing match in the United States. According to the Denver County coroner the cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head.

Women were allowed to competitively box for the first time at the Olympics during the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, producing the world&#x27;s first 12 female Olympic medalist boxers. At those Olympics, Claressa Shields became the first American woman to win a boxing gold medal. As well, Marlen Esparza became the first American woman to qualify for the Olympics in women&#x27;s boxing when she qualified for those Olympics. She went on to defeat Karlha Magliocco, making her the first American woman winner of an Olympic boxing match, and to win a bronze medal, making her the first American woman winner of any Olympic boxing medal.

In 2014 the International Women&#x27;s Boxing Hall of Fame, located in America, held its first induction.

Claressa Shields won a gold medal in the women&#x27;s middleweight division at the 2016 Olympics; as she had already won a gold medal (in the same division) at the 2012 Olympics, this made her the first American boxer of any gender to win consecutive Olympic medals.

Also in 2016, Christy Martin became the first female boxer inducted into the Nevada Boxing Hall of Fame.

American major boxing broadcasting network HBO broadcast its first women&#x27;s bout, between Norway&#x27;s Cecilia Brækhus and America&#x27;s Kali Reis, on May 5, 2018, which Brækhus won.

In 2019 American boxer Christy Martin became one of the first three women boxers (and the first American woman boxer) elected to the International Boxing Hall of Fame; 2019 was the first year that women were on the ballot.

In 2021, American Claressa Shields defeated Marie-Eve Dicaire and thus became the first boxer in the four-belt era to hold undisputed titles in two weight classes, and the first female boxer ever to be an undisputed champion in two weight classes.

The first women&#x27;s boxing match to headline Madison Square Garden, described as the &#x27;biggest women&#x27;s fight of all time&#x27;, was held on April 30, 2022, between Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano, with Taylor&#x27;s undisputed lightweight titles on the line. Taylor defeated Serrano by split decision.

In 2023, New York boxer Kathy “Wildcat” Collins became the first female boxer inducted into the New York State Boxing Hall of Fame.

Also in 2023, American boxer Claressa Shields became the first woman to win the Best Boxer ESPY Award.

In 2024, President-elect Donald Trump said in a keynote address for Turning Point USA, “There&#x27;s a spirit that we have now that we didn&#x27;t have just a short while ago. Sadly, we didn&#x27;t have. Who the hell can have spirit watching women get beat up in a boxing ring? I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s spirit, right? We’re going to end that one quick! We’re going to end it very quickly. We’re going to end that one very quickly.” Trump had previously falsely said boxers Lin Yu-ting and Imane Khelif “transitioned from men to women”, and said their wins were “demeaning to women”. He said about Khelif’s win over Italian boxer Angela Carini that “this beautiful young woman from Italy” fought against a “man”.

Professional women&#x27;s boxing has declined in popularity in the United States and struggles to get viewership and sponsorship. Many women boxers have to fight in Mexico or Europe in order to make a good living. The sport has largely been supplanted by Women&#x27;s MMA, which is increasingly popular in the USA.

== Differences between men and women&#x27;s boxing rules ==
Women’s boxing matches are usually ten rounds at most, with two minutes per round, while men&#x27;s boxing matches are twelve rounds of three minutes each. In 2017 the president of the World Boxing Council stated, “The WBC will not sanction any bout for women if rounds are scheduled for 3 minutes, and will not sanction any bout scheduled for 12 rounds.”

As stated by the International Boxing Association Technical Rules and Competition Rules:

– head guards are necessary for female boxers of any age;

– a breast guard is advised for female fighters in addition to a pubic (crotch) guard;

– pregnant sportswomen are not allowed to engage in combat.

British rules require all female boxers to wear 10-ounce gloves, while male boxers are required to wear 8-ounce gloves for all divisions up to welterweight and 10-ounce gloves only above welterweight.

== Women&#x27;s boxing in pop culture ==
Until the 1990s, movies about female boxers were sparse and marketed as softcore X-rated films in order to cater to the mainstream male gaze. However, throughout the 1990s and 2000s, movies such as &quot;Blonde Fist&quot;, &quot;Shadow Boxers&quot;, and &quot;Girlfight&quot; were released and, according to scholar Camilla Fojas, changed boxing culture. The movie &quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot;, about a female boxer, received seven nominations for the 77th Academy Awards and won four categories: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress, and Best Supporting Actor. It has since been cited as one of the best films of the 2000s, the 21st century, and of all-time.

Women&#x27;s boxing has also been the topic of some books, for example Leah Hager Cohen&#x27;s &quot;Without Apology: Girls, Women, and the Desire to Fight&quot; (2005).

<doc id="84608" wikidata="Q80559" url="?curid=84608" title="Eddie George">
<text>Edward Nathan George Jr. (born September 24, 1973) is an American football coach and former player who is the current head football coach at Tennessee State University. He played as a running back in the National Football League (NFL) for nine seasons, primarily for the Houston / Tennessee Oilers / Titans franchise.

He played college football for the Ohio State Buckeyes and won the Heisman Trophy in 1995. He was drafted in the first round of the 1996 NFL draft, and played professionally for the Tennessee Titans (both in Tennessee and in Houston when the franchise was known as the Houston Oilers) and Dallas Cowboys. George was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2011 as a player, and the International Sports Hall of Fame in 2020.

Post-football, George earned an MBA from Northwestern University&#x27;s Kellogg School of Management. In 2015, he guest starred on an IFC episode of the satirical talk-show &quot;Comedy Bang! Bang!&quot;, titled &quot;Eddie George Wears a Navy Suit and Half-Zip Pullover.&quot; In 2016, he appeared on Broadway in the musical &quot;Chicago&quot; as the hustling lawyer Billy Flynn.

==Early life==
George was born in Philadelphia. He played Pop Warner football for the Abington Raiders. He attended Abington Senior High School until the tenth grade, and then transferred to Fork Union Military Academy. George made the decision to stay at Fork Union Military Academy for a fifth prep school year or postgraduate year. Such choices are commonly made by high school football players hoping to improve their recruitment status with colleges, but for George, it meant another year of the rigorous military lifestyle. George rushed for 1,372 yards in his postgraduate season at FUMA, attracting the attention of several major colleges.

==College career==
George attended Ohio State University, where he majored in landscape architecture and played for the Ohio State Buckeyes football team. As a freshman running back, George scored three rushing touchdowns in a win over Syracuse. However, he suffered a major setback in a game against Illinois. In that game, George lost a fumble at the Illinois 4-yard line that was returned 96 yards for a touchdown. Later in the game, with Ohio State leading by 2 points in the final quarter, George fumbled again, this time on Illinois&#x27; 1-yard line. Illinois recovered the fumble and drove for the game-winning touchdown.

Before the Illinois game, George had carried the ball 25 times and scored 5 touchdowns, but he had only 12 more rushing attempts and no more touchdowns for the rest of the year. In the following season, George was listed in the depth chart as the team&#x27;s third-string running back, behind Raymont Harris. He carried the ball just 42 times, mostly when Ohio State had a large lead late in games, but showed his potential by averaging 5.3 yards per carry. As a junior, George became the team&#x27;s starting running back and went on to rush for 1,442 yards and 12 touchdowns.

As a senior in the 1995 season, George rushed for a school-record 1,927 yards and 24 touchdowns, an average of 148.23 yards per game, while also catching 47 passes for 417 yards and another score (George only caught 16 passes in his first three seasons). One of his best performances of the year was in a 45–26 win over Notre Dame, where he rushed for 207 yards, his third 200-yard game of the season. He also rushed for a school-record 314 yards and scored 3 touchdowns in OSU&#x27;s victory over Illinois.

In the 3 years after his 2 fumbles as a freshman, George had over 600 rushing attempts and fumbled only 6 times. Ohio State finished the season with an 11–2 record. George was recognized as a unanimous All-American. He won the Heisman Trophy in the closest vote in the history of the award at the time, beating Nebraska&#x27;s Tommie Frazier by 264 votes. George left Ohio State second in school history in career rushing yards (3,768) and third in rushing touchdowns (44). Overall, he finished with 4,284 all-purpose yards, 45 touchdowns, and a 5.5 yards per carry average.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==
===Houston / Tennessee Oilers / Titans===
George was a first-round draft selection (14th overall pick) of the Houston Oilers (now the Tennessee Titans) in the 1996 NFL Draft, being selected after Jerome Bettis elected to be traded to the rival Pittsburgh Steelers over the Oilers when the St. Louis Rams replaced Bettis with Lawrence Phillips. George won the NFL Rookie of the Year award in 1996, and was the Oilers/Titans&#x27; starting tailback through 2003, never missing a start. He made the Pro Bowl four consecutive years (1997–2000), and assisted the Titans to a championship appearance in Super Bowl XXXIV, where they lost to the St. Louis Rams 23–16. George gained 391 combined rushing and receiving yards in the Titans&#x27; three playoff games that year and went on to rush for 95 yards, catching two passes for 35 yards, and score two touchdowns in the Super Bowl.

George is only the second NFL running back to rush for 10,000 yards while never missing a start, joining Jim Brown. Only Walter Payton (170) started more consecutive regular-season games than George&#x27;s 130.

Though George rushed for 1,000 yards in all but one season, numerous sportswriters suggested that a heavy workload caused a decline in George&#x27;s productivity. In five of his eight seasons with the Titans, George carried the ball over 330 times. In 2001, George averaged just 2.98 per carry, the fourth lowest number in league history among running backs with more than 200 rushing attempts in a season. George&#x27;s decline in production along with several toe and ankle injuries were contributing factors in Titans owner Bud Adams&#x27; decision to release him on July 21, 2004, in part due to salary cap considerations, after George would not agree to a pay cut.

===Dallas Cowboys===
On July 23, 2004, George signed a one-year contract with the Dallas Cowboys for $1.5 million-plus incentives that could have earned him more than the $4.25 million he would have made under his previous contract with the Titans. George only started 8 games for Dallas while rookie Julius Jones was out for two months with a fractured scapula. He became the backup running back when Jones returned midway through the season, finishing with 432 yards on 132 carries and 4 touchdowns. He officially retired in 2006.

He wore race number 27 during the race, just as he wore number 27 during his college and NFL careers. George later stated that completing the race was tougher than playing in the NFL.

In 2008, George campaigned for Senator Barack Obama&#x27;s presidential bid.

After he retired from football, George went back to complete his bachelor&#x27;s degree in landscape architecture from Ohio State. He later graduated from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, earning his MBA degree from the Executive MBA program.

She is best known for being a part of the group SWV (Sisters with Voices) and later being a contestant on the of the CBS reality show &quot;Survivor&quot;. On the 12th episode, &quot;&quot;, George surprised his wife, by visiting her on Exile Island. His other thespian credits include performances on Broadway and in film.

George&#x27;s jersey was retired by the Titans during a halftime ceremony against the Indianapolis Colts on September 15, 2019, along with former teammate Steve McNair who was killed in 2009.

<doc id="84611" wikidata="Q5031622" url="?curid=84611" title="Candaon">
<text>In Greek mythology, Candaon is a rare name of uncertain meaning. In the &quot;Alexandra&quot; of Lycophron, a long and obscure poem, there is a reference to a human sacrifice conducted with the &quot;three-fathered sword of Candaon&quot;. The scholia to Lycophron explain this as a transferred epithet: Candaon is Orion, who was begotten, in a curious manner, by Zeus, Hermes and Poseidon.

It is not clear from the context whether the sacrifice is that of Polyxena by Neoptolemus or that of Iphigeneia by Agamemnon. In the first case, Candaon would be Hephaestus, who made the sword for Peleus, who gave it to Neoptolemus. In the second, &quot;three-fathered&quot; refers to the generations of the Atreidae; Agamemnon&#x27;s sword is likely to have as long a narrative attached to it as his staff. Candaon may still be Orion; Pelops may well have acquired his sword. Enrico Livrea suggests that both interpretations are correct, and the ambiguity of the section is intentional.

Lycophron refers to Candaon again, as worshipped by the Crestonian Thracians. This time the scholiasts identify Candaon with Ares, and derive the name from καίειν &quot;kindle&quot; (or καίνειν &quot;kill&quot;) and δαίειν &quot;blaze&quot;, which is still plausible for Candaon as Hephaestus.

<doc id="84613" wikidata="Q585250" url="?curid=84613" title="Pamphylia">
<text>Pamphylia (; , &quot;Pamphylía&quot; ) was a region in the south of Asia Minor, between Lycia and Cilicia, extending from the Mediterranean to Mount Taurus (all in modern-day Antalya province, Turkey). It was bounded on the north by Pisidia and was therefore a country of small extent, having a coast-line of only about 120 km (75 miles) with a breadth of about 50 km (30 miles). Under the Roman administration the term Pamphylia was extended so as to include Pisidia and the whole tract up to the frontiers of Phrygia and Lycaonia, and in this wider sense it is employed by Ptolemy.
== Name ==
The name &quot;Pamphylia&quot; comes from the Greek Παμφυλία, itself from (&quot;pamphylos&quot;), literally &quot;of mingled tribes or races&quot;, a compound of πᾶν (&quot;pan&quot;), neuter of πᾶς (&quot;pas&quot;) &quot;all&quot; + φυλή (&quot;phylē&quot;), &quot;race, tribe&quot;. Herodotus derived its etymology from a Dorian tribe, the Pamphyloi (Πάμφυλοι), who were said to have colonized the region. The tribe, in turn, was said to be named after Pamphylos (Greek: Πάμφυλος), son of Aigimios.

== Origins of the Pamphylians ==
According to Encyclopædia Britannica, the Pamphylians were “a mixture of aboriginal inhabitants, immigrant Cilicians () and Greeks”. However, Herodotus and Strabo record that the Pamphylians were descended from Greeks who came with Calchas and Amphilochos after the Trojan War. Additionally, Pausanias states that they were a Greek race. Theopompus, as well, informs us that Pamphylia was inhabited by Greeks. Some modern scholars suggest that they migrated to Pamphylia from Arcadia and generally the Peloponnese in the 12th century BC. The significance of the Greek contribution to the origin of the Pamphylians can be attested alike by tradition and archaeology, and Pamphylia can be considered a Greek country from the early Iron Age until the early Middle Ages.

There can be little doubt that the Pamphylians and Pisidians were the same people, though the former had received colonies from Greece and other lands, and from this cause, combined with the greater fertility of their territory, had become more civilized than their neighbours in the interior. But the distinction between the two seems to have been established at an early period. Herodotus, who does not mention the Pisidians, enumerates the Pamphylians among the nations of Asia Minor, while Ephorus mentions them both, correctly including the one among the nations on the coast, the other among those of the interior.


A number of scholars have distinguished in the Pamphylian dialect important isoglosses with both Arcadian and Cypriot (Arcadocypriot Greek) which allow them to be studied together with the group of dialects sometimes referred to as Achaean since it was settled not only by Achaean tribes but also colonists from other Greek-speaking regions, Dorians and Aeolians. The legend related by Herodotus and Strabo, which ascribed the origin of the Pamphylians to a colony led into their country by Amphilochus and Calchas after the Trojan War, is merely a characteristic myth.

== History ==

During the Late Bronze Age, the region was on the western edge of the Hittite sphere of influence. A treaty between the Hittite king Tudḫaliya IV and his vassal, the king of Tarḫuntašša, defined the latter&#x27;s western border at the city Parha in later Pamphylia and the Kastaraya River. West of Parha were the Lukka lands.

In the historical era, the region&#x27;s population spoke Pamphylian, an idiosyncratic dialect of Greek seemingly influenced by Anatolian languages spoken nearby. On Cyrus&#x27;s defeat of Croesus, Pamphylia passed to the Persian Empire. Darius included it in his first tax-district alongside Lycia, Magnesia, Ionia, Aeolia, Mysia, and Caria. At some point between 468 and 465 BC, the Athenians under Cimon fought the Persians at the Eurymedon, and won; thus adding Pamphylia to their &quot;Delian League&quot; empire. Toward the end of the Peloponnesian War, the Athenians were weakened enough that the Persians were able to retake it.

Upon Alexander the Great&#x27;s defeat of Darius III, Pamphylia passed back to Greek rule, now Macedonians. After the defeat of Antiochus III in 190 BC they were included among the provinces annexed by the Romans to the dominions of Eumenes of Pergamum; but somewhat later they joined with the Pisidians and Cilicians in piratical ravages, and Side became the chief centre and slave mart of these freebooters. Pamphylia was for a short time included in the dominions of Amyntas, king of Galatia, but after his death lapsed into a district of a Roman province.

As of 1911, the district was largely peopled with recently settled Ottoman Muslims from Greece, Crete, and the Balkans, as a result of the long-term consequences of the Congress of Berlin and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire.

<text>Side (formerly &quot;Selimiye)&quot; is a city on the southern Mediterranean coast of Turkey. It includes the modern resort town and the ruins of the ancient city of Side, one of the best-known classical sites in the country. Modern Side is a neighbourhood of the municipality and district of Manavgat, Antalya Province, Turkey. Its population is 14,527 (2022). Before the 2013 reorganisation, it was a town (&quot;belde&quot;). It lies near Manavgat, 78 km from Antalya.

It is located on the eastern part of the Pamphylian coast, which lies about 20 km east of the mouth of the Eurymedon River. Today, as in antiquity, the ancient city is situated on a small north-south peninsula about 1 km long and 400 m across.

==History==

Pseudo-Scylax, Strabo and Arrian record that Side was founded by Greek settlers from Cyme in Aeolis, a region of western Anatolia. This most likely occurred in the 7th century BC. A basalt column base from the 7th century BC found in the excavations and attributable to the Neo-Hittites is evidence of the site&#x27;s early history.

Possessing a good harbour for small craft, Side&#x27;s natural geography made it one of the most important trade centres in the region.

Its tutelary deity was Athena, whose head adorned its coinage.

Excavations have revealed several inscriptions written in the language of Side. The inscriptions, dating from the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, remain undeciphered, but testify that the local language was still in use several centuries after colonisation.

===Macedonian Rule===


Alexander the Great occupied Side without a struggle in 333 BC. Alexander left only a single garrison behind to occupy the city. This occupation, in turn, introduced the people of Side to Hellenistic culture, which flourished from the 4th to the 1st century BC. After Alexander&#x27;s death, Side fell under the control of one of Alexander&#x27;s generals, Ptolemy I Soter, who declared himself king of Egypt in 305 BC. The Ptolemaic dynasty controlled Side until it was captured by the Seleucid Empire in the 2nd century BC. Yet, despite these occupations, Side managed to preserve some autonomy, grew prosperous, and became an important cultural centre.
In 190 BC a fleet from the Greek island city-state of Rhodes, supported by Rome and Pergamum, defeated the Seleucid King Antiochus the Great&#x27;s fleet, which was under the command of the fugitive Carthaginian general Hannibal. The defeat of Hannibal and Antiochus the Great meant that Side freed itself from the overlord-ship of the Seleucid Empire. 

===Post-Seleucid Rule===
The Treaty of Apamea (188 BC) forced Antiochus to abandon all European territories and to cede all of Asia Minor north of the Taurus Mountains to Pergamum. However, the dominion of Pergamum only reached de facto as far as Perga, leaving Eastern Pamphylia in a state of uncertain freedom. This led Attalus II Philadelphus to construct a new harbour in the city of Attalia (the present Antalya), although Side already possessed an important harbour of its own. Between 188 and 36 BC Side minted its own money, tetradrachms showing Nike and a laurel wreath (the sign of victory).

In the 1st century BC, Side reached a peak when the Cilician pirates established their chief naval base and a centre for their slave-trade.

===Romans===


The consul Servilius Vatia defeated these brigands in 78 BC and later the Roman general Pompey in 67 BC, bringing Side under the control of Rome and beginning its second period of ascendancy, when it established and maintained a good working relationship with the Roman Empire.

Emperor Augustus reformed the state administration and placed Pamphylia and Side in the Roman province of Galatia in 25 BC, after the short reign of Amyntas of Galatia between 36 and 25 BC. Side began another prosperous period as a commercial centre in Asia Minor through its trade in olive oil. Its population grew to 60,000 inhabitants. This period would last well into the 3rd century AD. Side also established itself as a slave-trading centre in the Mediterranean. Its large commercial fleet engaged in acts of piracy, while wealthy merchants paid for such tributes as public works, monuments, and competitions as well as the games and gladiator fights. Most of the extant ruins at Side date from this period of prosperity.

Side was the home of Eustathius of Antioch, of the philosopher Troilus, of the fifth-century ecclesiastical writer Philip; of the famous lawyer Tribonian.

===Decline===

Side began a steady decline from the 4th century on. Even defensive walls could not stop successive invasions of highlanders from the Taurus Mountains. During the 5th and 6th centuries, Side experienced a revival, and became the seat of the Bishopric of Eastern Pamphylia. Arab fleets, nevertheless, raided and burned Side during the 7th century, contributing to its decline. The combination of earthquakes, Christian zealots and Arab raids, left the site abandoned by the 10th century, its citizens having emigrated to nearby Attalia.

In the 12th century, Side temporarily established itself once more as a large city. An inscription found on the site of the former ancient city shows a considerable Jewish population in early Byzantine times. However, Side was abandoned again after being sacked. Its population moved to Attalia, and Side became known as Eski Adalia &#x27;Old Antalya&#x27; and was buried.

===Ecclesiastical history===

As capital of the Roman province of Pamphylia Prima, Side was ecclesiastically the metropolitan see. The earliest known bishop was Epidaurus, presiding at the Synod of Ancyra, 314. Others are John, fourth century; Eustathius, 381; Amphilochius, 426-458, who played an important part in the history of the time; Conon, 536; Peter, 553; John, 680-692; Mark, 879; Theodore, 1027-1028; Anthimus, present at the synod held at Constantinople in 1054; John, then counsellor to the Emperor Michael VII Ducas, presided at a council on the worship of images, 1082; Theodosius and his successor Nicetas, twelfth century. John, present at a synod at Constantinople in 1156. The &quot;Notitiae Episcopatuum&quot; continued to mention Side as a metropolis of Pamphylia until the thirteenth century. It does not appear in the &quot;Notitia&quot; of Andronicus III. In 1397 the diocese was united with that of Attalia; in 1400 the Metropolitan of Perge and Attalia was at the same time the administrator of Side.

No longer a residential see, Side is today included in the Catholic Church&#x27;s list of titular sees.

== Monuments and Site ==

The great ruins are among the most notable in Asia Minor. They cover a large promontory which a wall and a moat separate from the mainland. Archaeologists have been excavating Side since 1947 and intermittently continue to do so.

The colossal theatre complex of the 2nd century is less well-preserved that of Aspendos, but it is almost as large, seating 15,000–20,000 people. It was converted into an open-air sanctuary with two chapels during Byzantine times (5th or 6th century).

The well-preserved city walls provide an entrance to the site through the Hellenistic main gate (&quot;Megale Pyle&quot;) from the 2nd century BC. 

The colonnaded street had marble columns whose remains can be seen near the Roman baths, restored as a museum displaying statues and sarcophagi from the Roman period. The agora includes the remains of the round Tyche and Fortuna temple (2nd century BC), peripteral with twelve columns, in the centre. In later times it was used as a trading centre where pirates sold slaves. 

The early Roman Temple of Dionysus is near the theatre. The fountain gracing the entrance is restored. At the left side is a Byzantine Basilica.

Other buildings include three temples and a nymphaeum, a grotto or fountain building of elaborate design, and a synagogue which was discovered under a modern place of residence. 

Excavation teams also found an ancient Greek brothel.

===The aqueduct===


The Roman aqueduct dates from 2nd half of the 2nd century AD and is 30 km in length. The aqueduct is special because it has an exceptional number of bridges which are still preserved as well as tunnels. This was because the altitude difference between source and city is only 36 m, so to make the gradient as high as possible it was necessary to keep the route as straight and short as possible through the hilly terrain, which entailed more expensive bridges (22 in total) and 16 tunnels 100-2260m long.

It was restored in the first half of the 3rd century, financed by Lollianos Bryonianos from Side according to an inscription.

==Today==

In 1895, Turkish Muslim Immigrants from Crete moved to the area of the ruins and called it Selimiye; they also built houses over the ruins when the Cretan Turks moved there. Today, Side has become a popular holiday destination as a result of the expansion of the Antalya coastal project and is experiencing a revival.

It was a popular spot for watching the solar eclipse of March 29, 2006.

The bustling street called Liman Caddesi connects the town bus station with the square on the seafront, where the statue of Atatürk is situated.

<text>Peacekeeping comprises activities, especially military ones, intended to create conditions that favor lasting peace. Research generally finds that peacekeeping reduces civilian and battlefield deaths, as well as reduces the risk of renewed warfare.

Within the United Nations (UN) group of nation state governments and organizations, there is a general understanding that at the international level, peacekeepers monitor and observe peace processes in post-conflict areas, and may assist ex-combatants in implementing peace agreement commitments that they have undertaken. Such assistance may come in many forms, including confidence-building measures, power-sharing arrangements, electoral support, strengthening the rule of law, and economic and social development. Accordingly, the UN peacekeepers (often referred to as Blue Beretsor Blue Helmets because of their light blue berets or helmets) can include soldiers, police officers, and civilian personnel.

The United Nations is not the only organisation to implement peacekeeping missions. Non-UN peacekeeping forces include the NATO mission in Kosovo (with United Nations authorisation) and the Multinational Force and Observers on the Sinai Peninsula or the ones organised by the European Union (like EUFOR RCA, with UN authorisation) and the African Union (like the African Union Mission in Sudan).

Under international law, peacekeepers are non-combatants due to their neutral stance in the conflict between two or more belligerent parties (to the same extent as neutral personnel and properties outside of peacekeeping duties) and are to be protected from attacks at all times.

==Definitions and types of peacekeeping operations==

=== United Nations peacekeeping missions ===
====Chapter VI and Chapter VII mission types====
There is a range of various types of operations encompassed in peacekeeping. In Page Fortna&#x27;s book &quot;Does Peacekeeping Work?&quot;, for instance, she distinguishes four different types of peacekeeping operations. Importantly, these types of missions and how they are conducted are heavily influenced by the mandate in which they are authorized. Three of Fortna&#x27;s four types are consent-based missions, i.e., so-called &quot;Chapter VI&quot; missions, with the fourth being a &quot;Chapter VII&quot; Mission. 
Chapter VI missions are consent-based; therefore they require the consent of the belligerent factions involved in order to operate. Should they lose that consent, Peacekeepers would be compelled to withdraw. Chapter VII missions, by contrast, do not require consent, though they may have it. If consent is lost at any point, Chapter VII missions would not be required to withdraw.
# &quot;Observation Missions&quot; which consist of small contingents of military or civilian observers tasked with monitoring cease-fires, troop withdrawals, or other conditions outlined in a ceasefire agreement. They are typically unarmed and are primarily tasked with observing and reporting on what is taking place. Thus, they do not possess the capability or mandate to intervene should either side renege on the agreement. Examples of observation missions include UNAVEM II in Angola in 1991 and MINURSO in the Western Sahara.
# &quot;Interpositional Missions&quot;, also known as traditional peacekeeping, are larger contingents of lightly armed troops meant to serve as a buffer between belligerent factions in the aftermath of a conflict. Thus, they serve as a buffer zone between the two sides and can monitor and report on the compliance of either side with regard to parameters established in a given ceasefire agreement. Examples include UNAVEM III in Angola in 1994, and MINUGUA in Guatemala in 1996.
# &quot;Multidimensional missions&quot; are carried out by military and police personnel in which they attempt to implement robust and comprehensive settlements. Not only do they act as observers or in an interpositional role, but they also participate in more multidimensional tasks—such as electoral supervision, police and security forces reform, institution building, economic development, and more. Examples include UNTAG in Namibia, ONUSAL in El Salvador, and ONUMOZ in Mozambique.
# &quot;Peace enforcement Missions&quot; are Chapter VII missions and unlike the previous Chapter VI missions, they do not require the consent of the belligerent parties. These are multidimensional operations comprising both civilian and military personnel. The military force is substantial in size and fairly well-equipped by UN Peacekeeping standards. They are mandated to use force for purposes beyond just self-defence. Examples include ECOMOG and UNAMSIL in West Africa and Sierra Leone in 1999, as well as the NATO operations in Bosnia—IFOR and SFOR.

==== UN missions during and after the Cold War ====

During the Cold War, peacekeeping was primarily interpositional in nature—thus being referred to as traditional peacekeeping. UN Peacekeepers were deployed in the aftermath of interstate conflict in order to serve as a buffer between belligerent factions and ensure compliance with the terms of an established peace agreement. Missions were consent-based, and more often than not observers were unarmed—such was the case with UNTSO in the Middle East and UNCIP in India and Pakistan. Others were armed—such as UNEF-I, established during the Suez Crisis. They were largely successful in this role.

In the post-Cold War era, the United Nations has taken on a more nuanced, multidimensional approach to Peacekeeping. In 1992, in the aftermath of the Cold War, then Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali put together a report detailing his ambitious concepts for the United Nations and Peacekeeping at large. The report, titled &quot;An Agenda for Peace&quot;, described a multi-faceted and interconnected set of measures he hoped would lead to effective use of the UN in its role in post-Cold War international politics. This included the use of preventative diplomacy, peace-enforcement, peace-making, peace-keeping and post-conflict reconstruction.

==== Broader aims of UN missions ====

In &quot;The UN Record on Peacekeeping Operations&quot;, Michael Doyle and Nicolas Sambanis summarise Boutros Boutros&#x27; report as preventative diplomacy, confidence-building measures such as fact-finding missions, observer mandates, and the potential deployment of UN mandated forces as a preventative measure in order to diminish the potential for violence or the danger of violence occurring and thus increasing the prospect for lasting peace. Their definitions are as follows:
# &quot;Peace-enforcement&quot;, meant to act with or without the consent of the belligerents in order to ensure any treaty or cease-fire mandated by the United Nations Security Council is maintained. This is done primarily under the auspices of Chapter VII of the UN Charter and the forces are generally heavily armed as opposed to the unarmed, or lightly-armed personnel frequently deployed as observers.
# &quot;Peace-making&quot;, meant to compel belligerents to seek a peaceful settlement for their differences via mediation and other forms of negotiation provided by the UN under the auspices of Chapter VI of the UN Charter.
# &quot;Peace-keeping&quot;, deployment of a lightly-armed United Nations presence in the field with the consent of the belligerents involved in order to build confidence and monitor any agreements between concerned parties. Additionally, diplomats would continue to work toward comprehensive and lasting peace, or for the implementation of an agreed-upon peace.
# &quot;Post-Conflict Reconstruction,&quot; intended to develop economic and social cooperation meant to mend relations between the belligerents. Social, political, and economic infrastructure would ideally prevent potential violence and conflict in the future and help to contribute to lasting and robust peace.

Peacekeeping also means working together with NGOs with a view to protecting cultural property. The UN peacekeeping commitment to the protection of cultural heritage dates back to 2012 and is being expanded. An outstanding mission was the deployment of the UN peace mission UNIFIL together with Blue Shield International in 2019 to protect the UNESCO World Heritage in Lebanon. Basically, the protection of cultural property (carried out by military and civil experts in cooperation with local people) forms the stable basis for the future peaceful and economic development of a city, region or country in many conflict areas. Whereby there is also a connection between cultural user disruption and the cause of flight, as President of Blue Shield International Karl von Habsburg explained during the United Nations peacekeeping and UNESCO mission in Lebanon in April 2019: &quot;Cultural assets are part of the identity of the people who live in a certain place. If you destroy their culture, you also destroy their identity. Many people are uprooted, often have no prospects anymore and subsequently flee from their homeland&quot;.

=== Non-United Nations peacekeeping ===
 
Not all international peacekeeping forces have been directly controlled by the United Nations. In 1981, an agreement between Israel and Egypt formed the Multinational Force and Observers, which continues to monitor the Sinai Peninsula.

The African Union (AU) is working on building an African Peace and Security Architecture that fulfils the mandate to enforce peace and security on the continent. In cases of genocide or other serious human rights violations, an AU-mission could be launched even against the wishes of the government of the country concerned, as long as it is approved by the AU General Assembly. The establishment of the African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA) which includes the African Standby Force (ASF) is planned earliest for 2015. On the regional level, the Economic Community of West African States has initiated several peacekeeping missions in some of its member states, and it has been described as &quot;Africa&#x27;s most advanced regional peace and security mechanism&quot;.

Unarmed Civilian Peacekeeping (UCP) are civilian personnel that carry out non-violent, non-interventionist and impartial set of tactics in order to protect civilians in conflict zones from violence in addition to supporting additional efforts to build a lasting peace. While the term UCP is not entirely ubiquitous among non-governmental agencies (NGOs) in the field: many utilize similar techniques and desire shared outcomes for peace; such as accompaniment, presence, rumour control, community security meetings, the securing of safe passage, and monitoring.

==Brief history==
===Creation and early years===

United Nations Peacekeeping started in 1948 when the United Nations Security Council authorised the deployment of UN unarmed military observers to the Middle East in order to monitor the armistice agreement that was signed between Israel and its Arab neighbours in the wake of the Arab-Israeli War. This operation was called the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) and is still in operation today. With the passage of resolution 73 (1949) by the Security Council in August 1949, UNTSO was given the task of fulfilling four Armistice Agreements between the state of Israel and the Arab states which had participated in the war. Thus, UNTSO&#x27;s operations were spread through five states in the region—Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and the Syrian Arab Republic.

===Cold War peacekeeping===
In the wake of independence in India and Pakistan in August 1947 and the subsequent bloodshed that followed the Security Council adopted resolution 39 (1948) in January 1948 in order to create the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan (UNCIP), with the purpose of mediating the dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir and the fighting related to it. This operation was non-interventionist in nature and was additionally tasked with supervision of a ceasefire signed by Pakistan and India in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. With the passage of the Karachi agreement in July 1949, UNCIP would supervise a ceasefire line that would be mutually overseen by UN unarmed military observers and local commanders from each side in the dispute. UNCIP&#x27;s mission in the region continues to this day, now under the operational title of the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP).

Since then, sixty-nine peacekeeping operations have been authorised and have deployed to various countries all over the world. The great majority of these operations have begun in the post-Cold War world. Between 1988 and 1998 thirty-five UN operations had been established and deployed. This signified a substantial increase when compared with the periods between 1948 and 1978; which saw the creation and deployment of only thirteen UN Peacekeeping operations and zero between 1978 and 1988.

Armed intervention first came in the form of UN involvement in the wake of the Suez Crisis in 1956. United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF-1), which existed from November 1956 to June 1967 was essentially the first ever United Nations peacekeeping force. It was given the mandate of ensuring the cessation of hostilities between Egypt, the United Kingdom, France, and Israel in addition to overseeing the withdrawal of French, Israeli and British troops from Egyptian territory. Upon completion of said withdrawal, UNEF would serve as a buffer force between Egyptian and Israeli forces in order to supervise conditions of the ceasefire and contribute to a lasting peace.

Shortly thereafter, the United Nations Operation in the Congo (ONUC), was deployed in 1960. This operation involved upwards of 20,000 military personnel at its peak, and resulted in the death of 250 UN personnel, including then Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold. ONUC was meant to ensure the withdrawal of Belgian forces in the Congo, who had reinserted themselves after Congolese independence in the wake of a revolt carried out by the Force Publique (FP), in order to protect Belgian citizens and economic interests. ONUC was also tasked with establishing and maintaining law and order (helping to end the FP revolt and ethnic violence) as well as provide technical assistance and training to Congolese security forces. An additional function was added to ONUC&#x27;s mission, in which the force was tasked with maintaining the territorial integrity and political independence of the Congo—resulting from the secession of the mineral-rich provinces of Katanga and South Kasai. The UN forces there, somewhat controversially, more or less became an arm of the Congolese government at the time and helped to forcefully end the secession of both provinces.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s the UN created multiple short-term missions all over the world including the Mission of the Representative of the Secretary-General in the Dominican Republic (DOMREP), the UN Security Force in West New Guinea (UNSF), the UN Yemen Observation Mission (UNYOM), in conjunction with more long-term operations such as the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP), the UN Emergency Force II (UNEF II), the UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) and the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).

===Since 1991===
Experiences of peacekeeping during the Yugoslav Wars, especially failures such as the Srebrenica Massacre, led, in part, to the United Nations Peacebuilding Commission, which works to implement stable peace through some of the same civic functions that peacekeepers also work on, such as elections. The Commission currently works with six countries, all in Africa. In 2013 the U.N. Security Council unanimously passed Resolution 2122, which among other things calls for stronger measures regarding women&#x27;s participation in conflict and post-conflict processes such as peace talks, gender expertise in peacekeeping missions, improved information about the impact of armed conflict on women, and more direct briefing to the Council on progress in these areas. Also in 2013, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), a UN women&#x27;s rights committee, said in a general recommendation that states that have ratified the UN Women&#x27;s Rights Convention are obliged to uphold women&#x27;s rights before, during, and after conflict when they are directly involved in fighting, and/or are providing peacekeeping troops or donor assistance for conflict prevention, humanitarian aid or post-conflict reconstruction.
The Committee also stated that ratifying states should exercise due diligence in ensuring that non-state actors, such as armed groups and private security contractors, be held accountable for crimes against women.

One of the findings of Page Fortna about where peacekeepers go is that &quot;peacekeeping is a matter of supply and demand&quot; From the supply side, she observes that there is unlikely a Peacekeeping mission in civil wars on countries close to one of the members of the Security Council. From the demand side, there is diverse evidence that peacekeeping missions are deployed in the countries who need it the most, this is where the risk of a recurring war is high.

== Composition of peacekeeping forces ==

===Nations that participate in peacekeeping missions===

The United Nations Charter stipulates that to assist in maintaining peace and security around the world, all member states of the UN should make available to the Security Council necessary armed forces and facilities. Since 1948, about 130 nations have contributed military and civilian police personnel to peace operations. While detailed records of all personnel who have served in peacekeeping missions since 1948 are not available, it is estimated that up to one million soldiers, police officers and civilians have served under the UN flag on its 71 missions. As of September 2021, 122 countries were contributing a total of around 76,000 military observers, police, and troops.

Despite the large number of contributors, the greatest burden continues to be borne by a core group of developing countries. The ten largest troop contributing countries (including police and military experts) to UN peacekeeping operations as of October 2021 were Bangladesh (6447), Nepal (5536), India (5481), Rwanda (5263), Ethiopia (4856), Pakistan (3949), Egypt (2818), Indonesia (2818), Ghana (2296), and China (2248). More than 14,000 civilian personnel serve in peacekeeping operations as legal or medical experts, educators, communication technology professionals, or administrators as of October 2021.

As of September 30, 2021, 4147 people from over 100 countries have been killed while serving on peacekeeping missions. India has the highest number of peacekeeper casualties with 174, followed by Bangladesh (159), Pakistan (159), Nigeria (157), Ghana (145), Ethiopia (138), Canada (123), France (115) and the United Kingdom (106). Since 1948, 56 peacekeepers have been killed each year on average, but recent decades have seen this number almost double, with 110 deaths per year since 2001. 30% of the fatalities in the first 55 years of UN peacekeeping occurred between 1993 and 1995.

There is a strong North-South divide in peacekeeping in that developing nations from the Global South provide the overwhelming majority of peacekeepers. Thomas G. Weiss and Giovanna Kuele argue that this is due to three factors: regional interests, prestige, and financial benefits. African countries are the largest contributors of peacekeepers, but the continent also has the highest number of peacekeeping missions, and most African peacekeepers serve on African missions. As an example, almost all 4800 Ethiopian peacekeepers are deployed in its neighboring countries of Sudan and South Sudan. Being a contributor to peacekeeping missions also provides some international prestige for developing countries, and can bolster countries&#x27; claims to be a great power as in the case of Brazil and India. Lastly, providing peacekeepers can have financial benefits for poorer countries. The monthly rate of reimbursement per peacekeeper includes $1,028 for pay and allowances; $303 supplementary pay for specialists; $68 for personal clothing, gear and equipment; and $5 for personal weaponry. Both the direct payments and the training and equipment provided by UN peacekeeping missions can be financially attractive to individual soldiers and developing nations. About 4.5% of the troops and civilian police deployed in UN peacekeeping missions come from the European Union and less than one percent from the United States.

With regard to mission leadership, Force Commanders often come from large troop contributors, while the Special Representatives of the Secretary General often come from developed countries.

===Women&#x27;s participation in peacekeeping===

Security Council Resolution 1325 was the first major step taken by the UN to include women as active and equal actors in “the prevention and resolution of conflicts, peace negotiations, peace-building, peacekeeping, humanitarian response and in post-conflict reconstruction and stresses the importance of their equal participation and full involvement in all efforts for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security”. A critique of this resolution is that UNSCR 1325 proposes the implementing gender mainstreaming, however the progress that has been accomplished in this area has focused on women, rather than on assessing the impacts of planned action on both men and women. In 2010, a comprehensive 10-year impact study was conducted to assess the success of this resolution and found that there was limited success with the implementation, particularly in the increasing women&#x27;s participation in peace negotiations and peace agreements, and sexual and gender-based violence has continued to be prevalent, despite efforts to reduce it.

In 2013 the U.N. Security Council unanimously passed Resolution 2122, which among other things calls for stronger measures regarding women&#x27;s participation in conflict and post-conflict processes such as peace talks, gender expertise in peacekeeping missions, improved information about the impact of armed conflict on women, and more direct briefing to the Council on progress in these areas. Also in 2013, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), a UN women&#x27;s rights committee, said in a general recommendation that states that have ratified the UN Women&#x27;s Rights Convention are obliged to uphold women&#x27;s rights before, during, and after conflict when they are directly involved in fighting, and/or are providing peacekeeping troops or donor assistance for conflict prevention, humanitarian aid or post-conflict reconstruction The Committee also stated that ratifying states should exercise due diligence in ensuring that non-state actors, such as armed groups and private security contractors, be held accountable for crimes against women.

As of July 2016, women serve in every UN peacekeeping mission either as troops, police, or civilian staff. In 1993, women made up 1% of deployed uniformed personnel. In 2020, out of approximately 95,000 peacekeepers, women constituted 4.8% of military personnel, 10.9% of police personnel, and 34% of justice and corrections personnel in UN peacekeeping missions. As of September 2021, no state contributing more than 100 UN peacekeepers nominates more than 25% women; in absolute numbers, the largest female contingents are provided by Ethiopia (578 female peacekeepers, or 12% of its total forces), Rwanda (500/10%), and Ghana (389/17%). While there is no set target for the proportion of women among military personnel, the UN is requesting contributing states to nominate a minimum of 20% women for policer officer positions and 30% for justice and corrections personnel. In 2024, the number of women in the military personnel of UN peace operations decreased, while their proportion increased. The proportional increase has continued since the launch of the Uniformed Gender Parity Strategy. The decline in absolute numbers can be traced back to the closure of MINUSMA. In June 2024, women constituted 8.6% of the total military personnel deployed in UN peace operations, which was an increase of 1.3% compared with the previous year.

== Theoretical basis for peacekeeping ==

While much has been written about peacekeeping and what peacekeepers do, very little empirical research has taken place in order to identify the manner in which peacekeepers can have an impact in a post-conflict environment. Columbia University Professor Virginia Page Fortna attempted to categorize four causal mechanisms through which peacekeepers have the opportunity to lay the groundwork for a lasting peace. Fortna&#x27;s four mechanisms are as follows:
# Change the incentives of recent belligerents, making peace more desirable or war more costly.
# Reduce the uncertainty and fear that drives security dilemma spirals.
# Prevent or control accidents or the actions of rogue groups that might otherwise escalate back to war.
# Prevent political abuse by one side (generally the government) that might cause actors losing the peace to take up arms anew.
Fortna argues that peacekeepers have a positive impact on the peace process, despite often being sent to places where peace is most difficult to achieve. Peacekeeping is often looked at by detractors as ineffective, or unnecessary. Peace prevails when belligerents already have a vested interest in sustaining peace and therefore it could be argued that Peacekeepers play only a minor role in creating a strong foundation for enduring peace. Yet these causal reasons illustrate the important roles that Peacekeepers play in ensuring that peace lasts, especially when contrasted against situations in which belligerents are left to their own devices. These causal reasons thus illustrate the need for Peacekeeping and lay a foundation for the manner in which Peacekeeping operations can have a substantive impact on the post-conflict environment.

In order to change the incentives for war and make peace more appealing the UN can provide a military force by way of an enforcement mandate which provides deterrence to would-be spoilers. They can monitor the situation making the potential for surprise attack by one of the belligerents less likely to occur or by making it more difficult to carry out such an attack. A lightly-armed observer mission can also serve as an early-warning force or &quot;tripwire&quot; for the aforementioned enforcement mission. Aid and recognition provided to the belligerents by the international community should be made conditional and based on compliance with objectives laid out in the negotiating process. And lastly, peace dividends should be provided in the forms of jobs, public works and other benefits.

To reduce uncertainty and fear the UN Peacekeeping force can monitor the aforementioned compliance, facilitate communication between belligerents in order to ease security dilemma concerns thus reassuring belligerents that the other side will not renege, and allow for belligerents to signal their legitimate intentions for peace to the other side. That is to say, provide a meaningful pathway for communication between both sides to make their intentions known and credible.

Prevention and control of potential accidents that may derail the peace process can be achieved by the peacekeeping force by deterring rogue groups. Belligerent forces are often undisciplined without a strong central source of command and control, therefore while a peace is being negotiated there is potential for a rogue group on one side to renege and spoil the peace process. UN forces can serve to prevent this. Additionally, the UN force can serve as a moderator and make communication easy between both parties and bring in political moderates from either side. By providing law and order UN peacekeeping forces can temporarily replace a state&#x27;s security forces and prevent a bias overreaction to an alleged violation by one side which could in turn result in escalation and a renewal in the violence.

Prevention of political abuse can be achieved through the reformation of institutions associated with the government. Training and monitoring the security forces (e.g. army or police) help to make them an unbiased protector of the people rather than a weapon of suppression for the ruling government. Hopefully this training can bring trust by the people for the security establishment. UN forces can also run and monitor elections in order to ensure a fair process. In other cases, the UN may provide a neutral interim government to administer the country during a transitional period wherein the associated government institutions are being retrained, reformed or better developed. Lastly, military groups such as armed rebels can be encouraged to put down their weapons and transformed into political organisations using appropriate non-violent means to mete out their grievances and compete in the election cycle. This is especially important as many of these groups serve as the chief opposition to a given government, but lack the means or know-how to operate effectively as political organisations.

Different peacekeeping missions take place as a result of different causal mechanisms. More military deterrence and enforcement are meant for those missions operating under the auspices of Chapter VII, while Chapter VI missions are meant to serve more as monitoring forces and interpositional operations are meant to target and prevent potential political abuse—these are primarily multidimensional missions and are heavily involved in the post-conflict political situation.

== Effectiveness of peacekeeping missions ==

Reviews of the academic literature show considerable evidence that peacekeeping increases peace. According to Fortna, there is strong evidence that the presence of peacekeepers significantly reduces the risk of renewed warfare; more peacekeeping troops contribute to fewer battlefield deaths; and more peacekeeping troops contribute to fewer civilian deaths. A study by political scientists at Uppsala University and Peace Research Institute Oslo estimates that an ambitious UN peacekeeping policy with a doubled peacekeeping operation and strong mandates would &quot;reduce the global incidence of armed conflict by two thirds relative to a no-PKO scenario.&quot; According to Fordham University political scientist Anjali Dayal, &quot;Scholars have found that peacekeeping keeps wars from bleeding across borders. Having more peacekeepers on the ground also seems to correspond with fewer civilians targeted with violence. And peace operations at times have successfully served as transitional authorities, handing power back to local authorities, although this is decreasingly true.&quot; A 2018 study found that peacekeeping reduces the severity of civil war on its own, but when it is coupled with mediation, the impact is greater. There is also evidence that the promise to deploy peacekeepers can help international organizations bring combatants to the negotiation table and increase the likelihood that they will agree to a cease-fire.

By controlling for specific factors that affect where peacekeepers are deployed and what the potential chances for peace are, Page Fortna&#x27;s statistical research shows that there is a statistically significant impact on lasting peace when peacekeepers are deployed. Despite the fact that peacekeepers are sent to locations where peace is least likely to succeed, Fortna finds that conservative estimates suggest that the presence of UN peacekeepers diminishes the risk for renewed violence by at least 55%-60%; with less conservative estimates upwards of 75%-85%. Additionally, her analysis concludes that there is little difference in the effectiveness between Chapter VI consent-based missions and Chapter VII enforcement missions. Indeed, enforcement missions only remain effective if the UN peacekeeping force can prove and sustain their credibility in the use of force. This stresses the importance of a UN mission maintaining the consent of the peacekept. Ultimately, Fortna finds that peacekeeping is an effective tool for ensuring a lasting peace; especially compared to situations in which belligerents&#x27; are left to their own devices. Utilising the previously mentioned causal mechanisms for peacekeeping, a UN peacekeeping force can have a substantial and substantive impact on sustaining a lasting peace. Having a relative consensus of the positive impact of peacekeeping for ensuring a lasting peace, Fortna and Howard suggest that the literature is moving towards the study of i) the effectiveness of the types of peace-keepers, ii) the transitional administrations, iii) the links between peacekeeping and democratisation, and iv) the perspectives of the &quot;peacekept&quot;.

Doyle and Sambanis&#x27; analysis finds that lasting peace is more likely after non-ethnic wars in countries with a relatively high level of development in addition to whether or not UN peacekeeping forces and financial assistance are available. They conclude that in the short run lasting peace is more dependent on a robust UN deployment coupled with low levels of hostility between belligerents. They note that increased economic capacity can provide an incentive not to renew hostilities. In the long run, however, economic capacity matters far more whereas the degree of hostility between belligerents is less important. As successful as UN deployments can be, they have inadequately spurred independent economic development within the countries where they have intervened. Thus, the UN plays a strong, but indirect role and success in lasting peace is predicated on the development of institutions that support peace, rather than serving as a deterrent for renewed war.

Other scholarly analyses show varying success rates for peacekeeping missions, with estimate ranging from 31 percent to 85 percent.

According to a 2020 study, non-UN peacekeeping missions are as effective as UN peacekeeping missions. Another 2020 study found that peacekeeping successfully protected civilians.

A 2021 study in the &quot;American Journal of Political Science&quot; found that UN peacekeeping in South Sudan had a positive impact on the local economy.

=== Factors that impact lasting peace ===
There are many factors that can have a negative impact on lasting peace such as hidden information about the relative strength possessed by the belligerents; a rebel group&#x27;s involvement in illicit financing through means such as through the export of diamonds and other minerals; participation in the trafficking of drugs, weapons and human beings; whether or not military victory was achieved by one side; the length of the war as well as how costly it was; commitment problems and security dilemma spirals experienced by both sides; whether a cease-fire or treaty signed by the belligerents; lack of transparency in the motives and actions carried out by belligerents in the immediate aftermath of the conflict; extremist spoilers; participants in the conflict that may benefit from its continuation; indivisibility and more.

Perhaps one of the most statistically significant contributors to a lasting peace is whether or not military victory was achieved by one side. According to Fortna&#x27;s research, civil wars in which one side wins, resulting in a cease-fire or truce, have an approximately 85–90% lower chance of renewed war. Moreover, peace treaties further reduce the risk by 60–70%.

If a group is funded by drugs, diamonds or other illicit trade then there is a substantial increase in the chance of renewed violence—100–250%—which is to say that in such circumstances war is two to three-and-a-half times more likely to begin again. While Fortna finds that wars which involve many factions are less likely to resume, Doyle and Sambanis find the opposite.

Costly wars and wars fought along identity lines both provide varied chances of the renewal of violence. While longer wars and peace established by treaty (especially those attained by military victory) can reduce the chances of another war.

== Impacts of peacekeeping on participating forces ==

===Military normalisation===
Some commentators have highlighted the potential to leverage peacekeeping operations as a mechanism for advancing military normalisation. Michael Edward Walsh and Jeremy Taylor have argued that Japan&#x27;s peacekeeping operations in South Sudan provide those promoting Japan&#x27;s military normalisation with &quot;a unique opportunity to further erode the country&#x27;s pacifist constitution.&quot; &quot;Unable to accept the full weight of modern peacekeeping operations without fundamental political, legal, and social changes,&quot; they conclude that &quot;Japan&#x27;s peacekeepers remain ill-prepared to tackle many serious contingencies requiring use of deadly force.&quot; For this reason, they suggest that Japan&#x27;s continued participation in UN peacekeeping operations might force policy changes that ultimately push the country toward &quot;a tipping point from which the normalisation of Japan&#x27;s military (will be) the only outcome.&quot;

===Political impact on sending countries===
Diana Muir Appelbaum has expressed concern that the creation of a military in Fiji for the purpose of serving in international peacekeeping missions, has produced a military powerful enough to stage four coups d&#x27;état (1987, 1999–2000, 2006, and 2009) and to rule Fiji as a military dictatorship for over two decades. However, a 2018 study published in the &quot;Journal of Peace Research&quot; found that countries where militaries are highly dependent on the funds they receive from UN peacekeeping were less likely to experience coups d&#x27;états than comparable countries less dependent on such funds.

===Impacts on individual peacekeepers ===

Studies of peacekeeping soldiers show both positive and negative effects. A study of 951 US Army soldiers assigned to Bosnia revealed that 77% reported some positive consequences, 63% reported a negative consequence, and 47% reported both. The peacekeepers are exposed to danger caused by the warring parties and often in an unfamiliar climate. This gives rise to different mental health problems, suicide, and substance abuse as shown by the percentage of former peacekeepers with those problems. Having a parent in a mission abroad for an extended period is also stressful to the peacekeepers&#x27; families.

Another viewpoint raises the problem that the peacekeeping may soften the troops and erode their combat ability, as the mission profile of a peacekeeping contingent is totally different from the profile of a unit fighting an all-out war.

==Criticism==

===Peacekeeping, human trafficking, and forced prostitution===

Since the 1990s, UN peacekeepers have been the subject of numerous accusations of abuse ranging from rape and sexual assault, to pedophilia and human trafficking. Complaints have arisen from Cambodia, East Timor and West Africa. In Bosnia-Herzegovina prostitution associated with trafficked women skyrocketed and often operated just beyond the gates of U.N. compounds. David Lamb, a regional human rights officer in Bosnia from 2000 to 2001 claimed &quot;The sex slave trade in Bosnia largely exists because of the U.N. peacekeeping operation. Without the peacekeeping presence, there would have been little or no forced prostitution in Bosnia.&quot; In addition, hearing held by the U.S. House of Representatives in 2002 found that members of SFOR were frequenting Bosnian brothels and engaging in sex with trafficked women and underage girls.

Reporters witnessed a rapid increase in prostitution in Cambodia, Mozambique, Bosnia, and Kosovo after UN and, in the case of the latter two, NATO peacekeeping forces moved in. In the 1996 UN study called &quot;The Impact of Armed Conflict on Children&quot;, former first lady of Mozambique Graça Machel documented: &quot;In 6 out of 12 country studies on sexual exploitation of children in situations of armed conflict prepared for the present report, the arrival of peacekeeping troops has been associated with a rapid rise in child prostitution&quot;.

Gita Sahgal spoke out in 2004 with regard to the fact that prostitution and sex abuse crops up wherever humanitarian intervention efforts are set up. She observed that the &quot;issue with the UN is that peacekeeping operations unfortunately seem to be doing the same thing that other militaries do. Even the guardians have to be guarded&quot;.

An investigation by Prince Zeid Ra&#x27;ad Zeid Al-Hussein, then Permanent Representative of Jordan to the United Nations, in 2006 resulted in a comprehensive report which detailed some of this abuse in detail— particularly that which occurred in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Sexual exploitation frequently came in the form of prostitution, wherein some money (an average of $1-$3 per encounter) was exchanged for sex. In other instances food, or jobs were utilized to ply women for sex. Other young women reported of &quot;rape disguised as prostitution&quot;, whereabouts peacekeepers would rape them and were then given some money or food in order to make the act seem consensual. Between May and September 2004, there were seventy-two allegations of sexual exploitation—68 against military and 4 against civilian personnel. By the end of 2004 there would be a total of 105 allegations. The majority of these allegations were in regards to sex with person under the age of 18 years (45 percent) and sex with adult prostitutes (31 percent). Rape and sexual assault made up approximately 13 and 5 percent respectively, with the remaining 6 percent of allegations relating to other forms of sexual exploitation. Most of the allegations were against peacekeepers from Pakistan, Uruguay, Morocco, Tunisia, South Africa, and Nepal.

Uruguayan President Jose Mujica apologized to Haitian President Michel Martelly over the alleged rape of an 18-year-old Haitian man by Uruguayan UN peacekeeping troops. Martelly said &quot;a collective rape carried out against a young Haitian&quot; would not go unpunished. Four soldiers suspected of being involved in the rape have been detained.

In July 2007 the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) confined an entire contingent of 734 Moroccans in the Ivory Coast in the wake of allegations that some had sexually abused underage girls. In the following years, there were 80 investigations carried out by the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS). In 2013, allegations were levelled on personnel from France, Gabon, and Burundi operating in the Central African Republic. These include accusations of sexual abuse and exploitation of at least 108 from Kemo Prefecture and that the vast majority of the cases involved minors. In 2016, more allegations of abuse were levelled on Peacekeepers operating in the Democratic Republic of Congo&#x27;s eastern province of North Kivu. Tanzania and the UN opened a joint inquiry into the alleged abuse, which involved Tanzanian troops. There have been 18 reports of sexual abuse, eight of which involved minors. Sixteen Tanzanian soldiers, a Malawian and a South African are implicated in the accusations. The UN reported in March 2016 that there was a large increase in allegations; which involved troops from twenty one countries. Most of the allegations involved troops from African countries including: Cameroon, Congo, Tanzania, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Ghana, Madagascar, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal and Togo.

===Peacekeepers and the Haiti cholera crisis===
Significant scientific evidence, first reported by the Associated Press, and later the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;Al Jazeera&quot;, and ABC News has shown that Nepalese peacekeeping troops stationed at a remote base in Mirebalais, Haiti, triggered a deadly cholera epidemic that has ravaged the country since October 2010. Cholera is a waterborne disease that causes diarrhoea and vomiting, and it can kill in a matter of hours if patients do not receive rehydration intervention. As of July 2012, Haiti&#x27;s cholera epidemic was the worst in the world: about 7,500 had died and about 585,000 Haitians (about 1 in every 20 Haitians) had become ill with the disease.

According to the UN-appointed Independent Panel of Experts on the Cholera Outbreak in Haiti, the conditions at the peacekeeping base were unsafe, and allowed contamination of Haiti&#x27;s river systems in at least two ways: &quot;The construction of the water pipes in the main toilet/showering area [was] haphazard, with significant potential for cross-contamination...especially from pipes that run over an open drainage ditch that runs throughout the camp and flows directly into the Meye Tributary System&quot;. Additionally, the panel reported that on a regular basis black water waste from the Mirebalais base and two other bases was deposited in an open, unfenced septic pit that was susceptible to flooding and would overflow into the Meye Tributary during rainfall.

In November 2011, over 5,000 victims of the cholera epidemic filed a claim with the UN&#x27;s internal claims mechanism seeking redress in the form of clean water and sanitation infrastructure necessary to control the epidemic, compensation for individual losses, and an apology. In July 2012, 104 members of the United States Congress signed a letter affirming that the &quot;actions of the UN&quot; had brought cholera to Haiti and that the UN should &quot;confront and ultimately eliminate cholera&quot;. In 2013 the UN rejected the claim and the victims&#x27; lawyers have pledged to sue the UN in court.

=== Cultural concerns related to contemporary peacekeeping ===
There is a notable intermingling of varied cultures when it comes to peacekeeping. From the vast number of troops, police and personnel that are brought together from various contributing countries to the oftentimes challenging ethnic regions which peacekeeping forces are often deployed. Because of these varied cultures, complicated cultural interactions take place which not only affect mission effectiveness, but can also lead to friction with the population the peacekeepers are meant to be assisting.

In most cases prior to 1988, specific countries often provided peacekeepers. At that point, only twenty six countries had sent personnel to participate in peacekeeping deployments. Today, that number has risen to more than eighty. This results in an extremely heterogeneous group. Thus, UN Peacekeeping deployments must not only contend with language complications, but also myriad cultural and social differences that can create operational difficulties that are hard to overcome. These differences can create problems with regard to interactions (whether personal or between institutions/units), misunderstandings, inadvertent offensive behaviour and prejudices that may be associated with a particular contingent from a given country.

In terms of operations, effectiveness can be hindered by the varying tactics, techniques and procedures employed by the military or police personnel that are a part of a given deployment. Because UN forces are cobbled together from so many different sources, there is a discrepancy in capabilities, training, equipment, standards and procedures. Moreover, substantial differences exist in the form of command and control between contributing members personnel. In addition, some nations may not wish to be subordinated to another, complicating unity of command. This can lead to deep-seated divisions between contingents within the UN force that results in a lack of mutual support between units in the field. This can be demonstrated in the experiences of UN peacekeeping forces deployed to East Timor, where the Australians engaged in a robust operation that maximised force protection in contrast to a pro-active heart and minds approach utilised by Great Britain&#x27;s Ghurka personnel.

Maintaining the consent of the peacekept is an important facet of modern peacekeeping. Notably in Bosnia, Somalia and Rwanda, fundamental principles of retaining that consent was ignored on the grounds of a humanitarian intervention—reflecting the nature of an Article VII intervention. Yet in order to stress and maintain the legitimacy of an intervention it is important that the UN&#x27;s forces continue to enjoy the consent of the population and government of the country to which they were deployed. This means making the peacekept feel a part of the process in addition to important cultural knowledge of the area in which peacekeepers are operating, in order to reduce friction and provide for a successful operation.

There has been little study on the interaction of cultures that exist within a peacekeeping force and the population within which they operate. However, in 1976 Galtun and Hveem studied Norwegian personnel who participated in UNEF-1 (in Gaza) and ONUC (Congo). They posited that knowledge of the culture and an understanding of the inhabitants in a given country were not only necessary, but crucial for the success of the mission. They found that personnel from the Norwegian contingent wanted greater insight into the conflict and the culture in which they operated. They also wanted more robust training with regard to working with people from other countries. Yet the study revealed the troops received very little from briefings and that the majority of the information regarding the conflict was gained through the news, reading books or speaking with other UN personnel—rather than any established UN training program.

Similarly, a study conducted on the relations between members of UNIFIL and local population in Lebanon, carried out by Heiberg and Holst, all but confirmed the findings. In their example, they found that the countries that were able to integrate more fully with the population and show a depth of knowledge about the local culture were more successful, while those that were ambitious, but less integrated into the local scene found themselves far removed from the individuals with which they were supposed to be engaged and their success, or lack thereof, illustrated this.Only the Italian contingent of some 2,200 people operated as part of the local environment and became an active element in restoring normal living conditions. Its soldiers were provided with the training required to acquaint them with the cultural, political and social situation of the people among whom they worked. Operating in a sector that contained approximately 600,000 inhabitants, mostly Shi&#x27;ites, the Italians carefully nurtured contact with the ordinary citizens and the political leaders in their area... While the Americans thought they were becoming involved in Lebanese politics, they entered into Lebanese culture and history with little or no understanding of the way things worked—or didn&#x27;t work... Most Americans did not understand the subtleties of short-term alliances, the length of memories and blood feuds, the strength of &quot;aln&quot; [kin] in Arab culture nor the nuances of religious differences.This illustrates the importance of understanding the significance that culture plays in the conduct of successful peacekeeping operations. However, despite the existence of a UN training manual that attempts to advise peacekeepers on necessary techniques, there is no unifying doctrine, or standardised procedure among peacekeeping contingents, which will ultimately hinder the potential for success.

=== Limitations on contemporary intervention and conflict resolution ===
Throughout the duration of the Cold War external intervention and mediation in civil conflicts took on a state-centric mechanism in which sovereignty was inviolable. Rarely did the international community intervene in internal conflicts involving a state&#x27;s government and domestic belligerents that opposed it. Since the end of the Cold War, however, that has changed. Today, mediation by international actors in civil conflict rest on a standardised resolution mechanism that accords broadly equal standing to all factions within a conflict, and attempts to reach a settlement accepted by all.

The end of the Cold War presented an opportunity to reshape the international system. This opportunity was afforded to the Cold War&#x27;s victors—that is to say, the United States and other western capitalist states governed by liberal-democratic values that put a premium on basic human rights and democratization. In the preceding decades the state was the only entity to receive special status. While there were exceptions, such as groups struggling against colonial powers, the state possessed the ultimate degree of legitimacy. As a result, the international community rarely meddled with the internal machinations of a given country. Sovereignty was not to be violated and this was a system which benefited both superpowers, their allies, as well as third world governments.

Now, however, with legitimacy being extended to non-state actors, as well as the opportunity for a minority to secede from a given state and form a new country there has been a dramatic shift in the international status quo. Moreover, the international community&#x27;s model for conflict resolution is heavily influenced by academic thought developed in western countries. This model encourages intervening in civil wars in order to stop political violence and come to a negotiated settlement which often involves democratising efforts. Critics such as Christopher Clapham and David Shearer, argue that this intervention can provide mechanisms for continued conflict to the detriment of the civilian population. Clapham&#x27;s argument is principally in relation to the situation in Rwanda leading up to the genocide, whereas Shearer focuses on the negative aspects of intervention, primarily regarding Sierra Leone, which prevents total victory by one side and results in the creation of asymmetries between belligerents which opens the door for continued bloodshed.

In Rwanda, third-party attempts at a negotiated settlement between the Hutu and Tutsi afforded an opportunity for Hutu extremists to prepare for the killing of Hutu moderates and the genocide of the Tutsi. The international community, led by regional states from the Organisation of African Unity, sought to negotiate a settlement and find a solution for the ongoing ethnic violence between Hutu and Tutsi via the Arusha Peace Process. This process lasted just over a year, included substantial international involvement, and incorporated many regional actors such as Tanzania (host of the process), Burundi, Uganda and Zaire.

While the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) was a major beneficiary of the Arusha accords and was able to redress many of its grievances, many of the gains that it made could have been achieved through military action. Arusha, according to Clapham, affected the relative power of the participants in the two following ways: a ceasefire which froze the distribution of territorial control at a particular point and secondly the importance it ascribed to the participants of the negotiations. Meaning that it froze the conflict and prevented continued territorial gains being made by the RPF, in addition to designating the degree of importance with regard to the factions within the negotiations. A faction&#x27;s importance was weighted not on their relative popularity or military strength, but on artificial weight assigned by the mediators. Thus, the entire process served to undermine the RPF&#x27;s position while stalling their hitherto successful military campaign, while allowing Hutu extremists to prepare for a genocide.

Shearer argues that modern strategies that rely solely on consent-based negotiations are severely limited and that victory by military means should not be ignored. He states that a shift in battlefield fortunes can often bring one belligerent to the negotiation table and will likewise moderate their demands.

Consent is of great importance when it comes to negotiation and mediation. The current international system and the conflict resolution model which the international community has utilised most since the end of the Cold War puts a premium on consent. But Shearer asks that if a belligerent uses negotiations and cease-fires as a method of delay in order to allow them to reposition military forces and continue fighting, then should consent-based strategies still be pursued, regardless of the potential for lengthening a conflict and the associated human cost?

According to the empirical analysis cited by Shearer, past civil wars with negotiated settlements have had little success. He cites a study from John Stedman that notes between 1900 and 1980 85% of civil wars were solved by one side winning outright (this excludes colonial wars). 15% percent ended as a result of negotiation. Additionally, Roy Licklider&#x27;s study supports these conclusions by noting the following:From 1945 to 1989, 58 out of a total of 93 civil conflicts, as he categorised them, were settled in some form, while the remainder continued. However, only 14 (or 24 percent) of those settled were solved by negotiation. The others (76 percent) ended with military victories. Additionally, fighting resumed in seven of the 14 conflict which were initially ended by negotiation. The overall success rate of negotiated settlements, therefore, was around 12 percent out of the internal wars that ended.In Sierra Leone the Revolutionary United Front, led by Foday Sankoh, fought an ongoing and bloody civil war with the government from 1991 to 1996. The conflict attracted little international attention, but managed to devastate the country and destroy its economy. Neither belligerent was willing to concede or compromise on their demands, despite multiple attempts at a negotiated settlement. Sankoh would come to the table after the intervention of the private military corporation Executive Outcomes and a reversal in the RUF&#x27;s battlefield fortunes.

In the aftermath the RUF was a depleted threat, civilians were able to return from refugee camps and begin rebuilding their lives. But the peace was fragile and negotiations were ongoing. The RUF was reluctant to put down their arms, concerned over potential retribution at the hands of army units and civilian militias alike. There was a planned deployment of UN peacekeepers meant to ease these concerns and help with the transition to peace, but things began to unravel. International contributors began to shy away from further peacekeeping initiatives; such as an expensive and open-ended mission in a strategically unimportant country. As a result, the UN&#x27;s intervention force was slow to come to fruition and then came to a halt completely when Sankoh argued the size of the contingent of 740 UN peacekeepers was too large.

The UN refused to engage without total consent from both parties, thus preventing the deployment of a peacekeeping force. This consent-based approach, Shearer argues, illustrates the limits the UN can play in the volatile and fragile state of affairs that exist during and after civil wars. &quot;In Sierra Leone, it meant that an important component needed to shore up the peace-building process was absent. It also meant that Sankoh was dictating terms.&quot; This consent-based approach effectively allowed the leadership of a brutal rebel group to hinder the potential for peace.

The situation was exacerbated by the fact that the newly elected President of Sierra Leone terminated the Executive Outcomes contract undermining his hard power advantage. Things were further inflamed when disaffected officers of the army overthrew the government in 1997. The war quickly renewed. A small UN force of monitors was deployed to observe the security situation. UNOMSIL, as it was called, was deployed between July 1998 and October 1999, but was forced to withdraw from the country when the RUF took the country&#x27;s capitol.

UNAMSIL was eventually formed and deployed in 1999, authorised under a Chapter VII mandate, it was meant to enforce the Lome agreements. However, violence would continue. From the outset the RUF was beyond uncooperative and once the ECOMOG contingent withdrew, the RUF attacked UN forces, eventually taking hundreds hostage. This led to an unexpected backlash from the international community that the RUF did not anticipate. Its leadership had expected the international community to cut and run, as it had done in Somalia and earlier when UNOMSIL fled Freetown. Instead, with British support, an aggressive campaign was waged against the RUF. UNAMSIL&#x27;s mandate was expanded and its manpower enlarged. By late 2000 and early 2001 the RUF&#x27;s military strength had been severely depleted. Thus the Abuja agreements were signed and UNAMSIL fulfilled its mandate in December 2005. While Sierra Leone is at peace today and the UN&#x27;s mission can be deemed a success, the way in which the situation developed illustrates Shearer&#x27;s point: that a consent-based approach focused on negotiation that encompasses all belligerents&#x27; interest may not necessarily lead to success. As we see, fighting continued despite the presence of UNOMSIL. Indeed, even after UNOMSIL was replaced by a more robust force under a Chapter VII mandate in the form of UNAMSIL the violence continued. When the British intervened militarily and substantially degraded the RUF&#x27;s capability to sustain the conflict, as Executive Outcomes had done years prior, the RUF finally come to the negotiating table and allowed for the establishment of peace.

Some authors question the idea of international interventions at all. In a 2005 working paper for the Center for Global Development, Jeremy Weinstein of Stanford University provides a theory of &quot;autonomous recovery&quot;, in which states can achieve sustainable peace without international intervention. Using case studies of Uganda, Eritrea, and Somalia, Weinstein demonstrates how states can develop effective institutions out of warfare. This method has cost and benefits that must be weighed against the potential outcome of international intervention. External intervention can stop mass atrocities, but also stop institutional change. Autonomous recovery elevates the strongest leader, but also rewards the strongest fighters who may be less inclined to share power. Furthermore, intervention depends on external influence while autonomous recovery is based on internal factors. The conclusions of his argument could suggest intervention is not ideal policy, but Weinstein argues the international community&#x27;s &quot;responsibility to protect&quot; doctrine has moral importance for intervention and the conditions for &quot;autonomous recovery&quot; are very rare. Weinstein argues the fundamental challenge is how to incentivise good governance and assistance to rebel groups without disrupting the connection of citizens to rulers in terms of revenue collection that enables accountability.

=== Mission creep ===
Although acknowledging a number of practical and moral reasons for peacekeeping operations, James Fearon and David Laitin assert that they have a tendency under some circumstances to become tangled with state-building efforts. In weak states facing successful guerrilla campaigns, peacekeepers face pressures to build state institutional and administrative capacity in order to achieve lasting peace. These pressures can lead to mission creep beyond the original purview of the peacekeeping operation; without engaging in state-building, the peacekeepers risk allowing the peacekept country to revert to violence following their exit. Thus, Fearon and Laitin advocate for the greater integration of state-building in peacekeeping efforts through a new framework of &quot;neotrusteeship&quot;, which would see foreign powers exercising a great deal of control over a weak state&#x27;s domestic affairs in order to ensure the prevention of future violence.

===Lack of engagement with the populace===
A growing critique of peacekeeping is the lack of engagement between the peacekeeping officials and the local populace. As Séverine Autesserre outlines in a 2015 Foreign Policy article, this creates an environment where the peacekeeping officials develop plans to &#x27;keep&#x27; the peace, but they are disconnected from reality, having the opposite effect on the ground. Additionally, it creates a reinforcement mechanism for the peacekeeping officials, because the officials on the ground report that their plan was successfully implemented, but, in reality, it had adverse effects. If the situation on the ground turns into another outbreak of violence, the local populace will be blamed.

This criticism is similar to the critic levelled at development in developing countries by authors such as James C. Scott, James Ferguson, and L. Lohman. Although peacekeeping and development are two different things, the logic behind the criticism is the same. The third-party officials-whether they are peacekeepers or agents of development-are isolated from the general populace, believing they know what is best, and refusing to gather information from a ground level. This is not out of maliciousness or imperialism, but out of a legitimate belief that they, as educated officials with access to other experts and who are well versed in development and peacekeeping literature, know what is best.

==Proposed reform==

===Brahimi analysis===
In response to criticism, particularly of the cases of sexual abuse by peacekeepers, the UN has taken steps toward reforming its operations. The Brahimi Report was the first of many steps to recap former peacekeeping missions, isolate flaws, and take steps to patch these mistakes to ensure the efficiency of future peacekeeping missions. The UN has vowed to continue to put these practices into effect when performing peacekeeping operations in the future. The technocratic aspects of the reform process have been continued and revitalised by the DPKO in its &quot;Peace Operations 2010&quot; reform agenda. This included an increase in personnel, the harmonisation of the conditions of service of field and headquarters staff, the development of guidelines and standard operating procedures, and improving the partnership arrangement between the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), African Union, and European Union. A 2008 capstone doctrine entitled &quot;United Nations Peacekeeping Operations: Principles and Guidelines&quot; incorporates and builds on the Brahimi analysis.

One of the main issues that the Brahimi report identifies is the lack of coordination and planning of the Peacekeeping Operations. Also, the difference between the objectives of the Peacekeeping Operations and the resources destined to fund the missions. Therefore, the report asks the Security Council to make clear the goals and the resources to accomplish them. According to Fearon and Laitin, the Brahimi Report provides a political instrument for the secretary-general to negotiate with the Security Council the goals, the troops, and the resources need it to the operations. This instrument tries to avoid the cases of underfunding presented in Missions such as in Bosnia, Somalia, and Sierra Leone.

Christine Gray analyses the issues of implementing the recommendations of the Brahimi Report. She explains the difficulty in implementing these recommendations. In particular, in reducing the gap between the mandates of Security Council and the actual resources devoted to implementing them.

<text>Gerrha () was an ancient and renowned city within Eastern Arabia, on the west side of the persian Gulf. Known from Greek sources, it has been identified with a few candidate archaeological sites in Eastern Arabia, with the main candidates being Hagar (modern-day Hofuf) and Thaj.

In the aftermath of the conquests of Alexander the Great, and his successors of the Seleucid Empire in the region, Gerrha became a cite of central importance in the Hellenistic world and the major site of trading in the Persian Gulf region. It was a major source of Arabian aromatics and for the transport of goods from India.

== Description ==
Gerrha was located at or near the Persian Gulf, possessing a port and an inland town. A detailed description of the city was offered by the geographer Strabo:After sailing along the [east] coast of Arabia [from the outlet of the Euphrates] for a distance of 2400 stadia [c.380 km] one comes to Gerrha, a city situated on a deep gulf. It is inhabited by Chaldaeans, exiles from Babylon. The soil contains salt and the people live in houses made of salt; and since flakes of salt continually scale off, owing to the scorching heat of the rays of the sun, and fall away, the people frequently sprinkle the houses with water and thus keep the walls firm. The city is 200 stadia [c.32 km] distant from the sea; and the Gerrhaeans traffic by land, for the most part, in the Arabian merchandise and aromatics. However Aristobulus says, on the contrary, that the Gerrhaeans import most of their cargoes on rafts to Babylonia, and thence sail up the Euphrates with them, and then convey them by land to all parts of the country.

== History ==
At first, Gerrha&#x27;s trade exports moved to Babylonia and transports moved by sea. However, soon during or after the lifetime of Alexander the Great, Gerrha&#x27;s transports began moving in the direction of Egypt and Syria and the mode of transport shifted from by sea to by land. Gerrhean incense is reported as an ingredient in Greek poison and it was also an essential item on some discovered shopping lists. Some Gerrheans have been documented in the West, like Taymallat of Gerrha, who made some offerings in the Aegean island of Delos.

Polybius reports that the Seleucid emperor Antiochus III sailed to Gerrha in 205 BC. The Gerrhaeans petitioned, and were granted by Antiochous, the rite to practice their religious customs. Robert Hoyland has suggested that a likely factor in this expedition was for Antiochus to use a show of force to get the Gerrhaeans to direct more of their trade through his territory. As the Seleucid domain expanded through military victories against the Ptolemies, Gerrha&#x27;s trading partners also expanded to include Palestine, Syria, and the Nabataeans.

By the first and second centuries AD, Gerrha as a city begins to decline. The exact causes are not known but one possibility is that the new Parthian Empire began to take over its trade routes with India. As Gerrha&#x27;s influence declined, an encroachment of Arab tribes into the region also took place.

The city of Gerrha was taken by the Qarmatians at the end of the ninth century.

== Location and etymology ==
To the Ancient Greeks, eastern Arabia (the present-day al-Hasa province) was known as Gerrha after its capital city. Gerrha was a Greek alteration of the Arabic Hajar (present-day Hofuf), the name of the largest city of ancient Bahrayn (Bahrayn was also known as Hagar or Gerrha in Hellenistic times).

Other English spellings are &quot;Hajar Hufuf, Hajar Hasa&#x27; Hajarah&quot;. Hagar (Gerrha) is not to be confused with the west Arabian Al-Hijr (al-Hijrah, ancient Hegra), the present-day Mada&#x27;in Saleh or al-Ula near the Red Sea. Al-Hamdani says the etymology of &quot;Hajar&quot; means ‘large village’ in the Himyaritic language (derived from Hakar).

The researcher Abdulkhaliq Al Janbi argued in his book that Gerrha was most likely the ancient city of Hajar, located in modern-day Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia. Al-Janbi&#x27;s theory is the most widely accepted one by modern scholars, although there are some difficulties with this argument, given that Al-Ahsa is 60 km inland and thus less likely to be the starting point for a trader&#x27;s route, making a location within the archipelago of islands comprising the modern Kingdom of Bahrain, particularly the main island of Bahrain itself, another possibility.

Another location suggested as Gerrha is Thaj.

<text>Gorgan (; ) is a city in the Central District of Gorgan County, Golestan province, Iran, serving as capital of the province, the county, and the district. It lies approximately to the northeast of the national capital Tehran, and some away from the Caspian Sea.

==History==

There are several archaeological sites near Gorgan, including Tureng Tepe and Shah Tepe, in which remains dating from the Neolithic and Chalcolithic eras. Some other important Neolithic sites in the area are Yarim Tepe, and Sange Chaxmaq. The nearby Shahroud Plain has many such sites. More than 50 are on the Gorgan Plain.
According to the Greek historian Arrian, Zadracarta was the largest city of Hyrcania and the site of the &quot;royal palace&quot;. The term means &quot;the yellow city&quot;, and it was given to it from the great number of oranges, lemons, and other fruit trees which grew in the outskirts of that city.

Hyrcania became part of the Achaemenid Empire during the reign of Cyrus the Great (559–530 BC), its founder, or his successor Cambyses (530-522 BC).

The Great Wall of Gorgan, the second biggest defensive wall in the world, was built in the Parthian and Sasanian periods.

At the time of the Sasanians, &quot;Gurgan&quot; appeared as the name of a city, province capital, and province.

Gorgan maintained its independence as a Zoroastrian state even after Persia was conquered by the Muslim Arabs in the 7th century.

In 1210, the city was invaded and sacked by the army of Kingdom of Georgia under command of the brothers Mkhargrdzeli.

&quot;Old Gorgan&quot; was destroyed during the Mongol invasion in the 13th century, and the center of the region was moved to what was called &quot;Astarabad&quot;, which is currently called &quot;Gorgan&quot;.

Gorgan with its surrounding regions was sometimes considered part of the Tabaristan region.

Astarabad was an important political and religious city during the Qajar era.

<doc id="84625" wikidata="Q440256" url="?curid=84625" title="Sandy Koufax">
<text>Sanford Koufax (; né Braun; born December 30, 1935), nicknamed &quot;the Left Arm of God&quot;, is an American former baseball pitcher who played 12 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers from 1955 to 1966. Widely regarded as one of the greatest pitchers in baseball history, Koufax was the first three-time winner of the Cy Young Award, each time winning unanimously and the only pitcher to do so when a single award was given for both the leagues; he was also named the National League Most Valuable Player in 1963. Retiring at the age of 30 due to chronic pain in his pitching elbow, Koufax was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 1972 at the age of 36, the youngest player ever elected.

Born in Brooklyn, New York, Koufax was primarily a basketball player in his youth and had pitched in only a few games before signing with the Brooklyn Dodgers at age 19. Due to the bonus rule he signed under, Koufax never pitched in the minor leagues. His lack of pitching experience caused manager Walter Alston to distrust Koufax, who saw inconsistent playing time during his first six seasons. As a result, though he often showed flashes of brilliance, Koufax struggled early on. Frustrated with the way he was being managed by the Dodgers, he almost quit after the 1960 season. After making adjustments prior to the 1961 season, Koufax quickly rose to become the most dominant pitcher in the major leagues, as well as the first major sports star on the West Coast. He was an All-Star in each of his last six seasons, leading the National League (NL) in earned run average each of his last five years, in strikeouts four times, and in wins and shutouts three times each. He was the first pitcher in the live-ball era to post an earned run average below 2.00 in three different qualifying seasons, and the first in the modern era to record a 300-strikeout season three times.

Koufax won the Major League Triple Crown three times, leading the Dodgers to a pennant in each of those years. He was the first major league pitcher to throw four no-hitters, including a perfect game in 1965. He was named the World Series MVP twice, leading the weak-hitting Dodgers to titles in and . Despite his comparatively short career, his 2,396 career strikeouts ranked seventh in major league history at the time, trailing only Warren Spahn (2,583) among left-handers; his 40 shutouts were tied for ninth in modern NL history. He was the first pitcher in history to average more than nine strikeouts per nine innings pitched, and the first to allow fewer than seven hits per nine innings pitched. Koufax, along with teammate Don Drysdale, became a pivotal figure in baseball&#x27;s labor movement when the two staged a joint holdout and demanded a fairer contract from the Dodgers before the 1966 season. Koufax is also considered one of the greatest Jewish athletes in history; his decision to sit out Game 1 of the 1965 World Series because it coincided with the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur garnered national attention and made him an iconic figure within the American Jewish community.

Since retiring, Koufax has kept a low profile and makes public appearances on rare occasions. In December 1966, he signed a 10-year contract to work as a broadcaster for NBC; uncomfortable in front of cameras and with public speaking, he resigned after six years. In 1979, Koufax returned to work as a pitching coach in the Dodgers&#x27; farm system; he resigned from the position in 1990 but continues to make informal appearances during spring training. From 2013 to 2015, Koufax worked in an executive position for the Dodgers, as special advisor to chairman Mark Walter. In 1999, he was named to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. His number 32 was retired by the Dodgers in 1972 and he was honored with a statue outside the centerfield plaza of Dodger Stadium in 2022. That same year, Koufax became the first player to mark the 50th anniversary of his election to the Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Koufax was born Sanford Braun to a Jewish family on December 30, 1935, in Borough Park, Brooklyn. His parents, Evelyn (née Lichtenstein) and Jack Braun, divorced when he was three years old. The son of a single working parent, he spent most of his childhood with his maternal grandparents and spent his summers at Camp Chi-Wan-Da, a Jewish summer camp in Ulster Park, New York, where his mother worked as a bookkeeper.

Evelyn, a certified public accountant, remarried when her son was nine to Irving Koufax, an attorney, whose name Sandy took. Koufax also gained a stepsister, Edith, Irving&#x27;s daughter from a previous marriage. Shortly afterwards, the family moved to the Long Island suburb of Rockville Centre. They moved back to Brooklyn in June 1949, the day after Koufax graduated from ninth grade, settling in the neighborhood of Bensonhurst.

As a youth, Koufax was better known for basketball than for baseball. He had started playing it at the Edith and Carl Marks Jewish Community House of Bensonhurst, winning a few local titles with the community center team. Attending Lafayette High School, Koufax would become the basketball team&#x27;s captain in his senior year. That year, he ranked second in his division in scoring, averaging 16.5 points per game. He made newspaper headlines for the first time when, during a preseason exhibition game between the Lafayette basketball team and the New York Knicks, he dunked twice and showed up Knicks star Harry Gallatin.

In 1951, Koufax joined a local youth baseball league known as the &quot;Ice Cream League&quot;, playing for the Tomahawks. He started out as a left-handed catcher before moving to first base. He joined Lafayette&#x27;s baseball team as a first baseman in his senior year at the urging of his friend Fred Wilpon. While with the high school team, he was spotted by Milt Laurie, a newspaper deliveryman and baseball coach who was the father of two Lafayette baseball players. Laurie noticed Koufax&#x27;s strong throwing arm and recruited him to pitch for the Coney Island Sports League&#x27;s Parkviews.

Koufax chose to attend the University of Cincinnati after becoming a walk-on for their freshman basketball team. Playing under coach Ed Jucker, he averaged 9.7 points per game. As a student, he was enrolled in a liberal arts major with the intention of transferring to the architectural school, and was a member of Pi Lambda Phi, a historically Jewish fraternity.

One day, Koufax overheard Jucker, who also coached the college baseball team, planning a last-minute road trip in his office which started in New Orleans. Eager to visit the city, he told Jucker, &quot;I&#x27;m a pitcher&quot; and made the team in a subsequent tryout. For the season, Koufax went 3–1 with a 2.81 earned run average, 51 strikeouts and 30 walks in 32 innings pitched.

===Major League tryouts===

While with the college baseball team, Koufax began to attract the attention of baseball scouts. Bill Zinser, a scout for the Brooklyn Dodgers, sent the team a glowing report that was seemingly filed away and forgotten. Gene Bonnibeau, a scout for the New York Giants, learned of Koufax through a Cincinnati newspaper and invited him to try out at the Polo Grounds after his freshman year. The workout did not go well for the nervous Koufax who threw wildly over the catcher&#x27;s head; he never heard back from the Giants.

That summer, Koufax began pitching regularly for the Parkviews. In September, Ed McCarrick, a scout for the Pittsburgh Pirates, was highly impressed with Koufax after seeing him in a few sandlot games. At McCarrick&#x27;s behest, Branch Rickey, general manager of the Pirates, sent scout Clyde Sukeforth to see Koufax. Sukeforth subsequently invited him to Forbes Field for a tryout before the Pirates&#x27; front office. Upon seeing Koufax pitch in person, Rickey remarked, &quot;This is the greatest arm I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot; The Pirates, however, failed to offer Koufax a contract until after he was already committed to the Dodgers.

Al Campanis, a Dodgers scout, heard about Koufax from sportswriter Jimmy Murphy of the &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot; who covered sandlot teams in Brooklyn and had seen him pitch a few times. He was also urged by Pat Auletta, the owner of a sporting goods store and founder of the Coney Island Sports League, to see Koufax pitch. Campanis arranged a tryout for him at Ebbets Field. With Dodgers manager Walter Alston and scouting director Fresco Thompson watching, Campanis assumed the hitter&#x27;s stance while Koufax started throwing; he later said, &quot;There are two times in my life the hair on my arms has stood up: The first time I saw the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and the second time, I saw Sandy Koufax throw a fastball.&quot;

After the tryout, Koufax&#x27;s father negotiated the contract with the Dodgers, asking for a bonus which would allow his son to finish college if his baseball career failed. They agreed on a $20,000 contract ($ today) – $6,000 then-league minimum salary, with a $14,000 signing bonus – and not to officially sign until after the season ended, with Irving Koufax and owner Walter O&#x27;Malley making a handshake commitment.

Returning to university, Koufax also had a tryout with the Milwaukee Braves after which general manager John Quinn made him a $30,000 offer. Having already committed to signing with the Dodgers, Koufax turned down the Braves&#x27; offer. He also turned down a belated offer from the Pirates, promising him $5,000 more than what the Dodgers did. Koufax officially signed with his hometown team on December 14, 1954.

==Professional career==
At the time of Koufax&#x27;s signing, the bonus rule implemented by Major League Baseball was still in effect, stipulating that if a major league team signed a player to a contract with a signing bonus in excess of $4,000 ($ today), they were required to keep them on their 25-man active roster for two full seasons. In compliance with the rule, the Dodgers placed Koufax on their major league roster. As it subsequently turned out, Koufax never played in the minor leagues.

During his first spring training, Koufax struggled with his new training regime and suffered from a sore arm most of the time. Having pitched fewer than twenty games in the sandlots and college combined, he did not know a lot about pitching such as how to properly field a ball, how to hold a runner on base, or even pitching signs, later saying, &quot;The only signs I knew were one finger for fastball and two for a curve, and here there were five or six signs.&quot; His lack of minor league experience meant Koufax never fully mastered all aspects of the game and took a lot longer to develop as a pitcher.

===Early years (1955–1960)===
Having injured his ankle in the last week of spring training, Koufax was placed on the disabled list for 30 days; he would be activated by the Dodgers on June 8. To make room for him, they optioned their future Hall of Fame manager, Tommy Lasorda, to their Triple-A affiliate, the Montreal Royals. Lasorda would later joke that it took &quot;one of the greatest left-handers in history&quot; to keep him off the Dodgers major league roster.

Koufax made his major league debut on June 24, 1955, against the Milwaukee Braves, with the Dodgers trailing 7–1 in the fifth inning. Johnny Logan, the first batter Koufax faced, hit a bloop single. Eddie Mathews bunted back to the mound, and Koufax threw the ball into center field. He then walked Henry Aaron on four pitches to load the bases before striking out Bobby Thomson on a 3–2 fastball for his first career strikeout. Koufax ended up pitching two scoreless innings, inducing a double play to end the bases-loaded threat and picking up another strikeout in a perfect sixth.

Koufax&#x27;s first start was on July 6, the second game of a doubleheader against the Pittsburgh Pirates. He lasted only 4.2 innings, giving up eight walks. He did not start again for almost two months.

On August 27, Koufax threw a two-hit, 7–0 complete game shutout against the Cincinnati Redlegs for his first major league win. He struck out 14 batters and allowed only two hits. His only other win in 1955 was also a shutout, a five-hitter against the Pirates on September 3.

In his rookie year, Koufax threw 41.2 innings in 12 appearances, striking out 30 batters and walking 28, with a record of 2–2 and 3.02 earned run average. The Dodgers went on to win the National League pennant and the 1955 World Series over the New York Yankees, the first title in franchise history; however, even though he was on the World Series roster, Koufax did not appear in the series. During the fall, he had enrolled in the Columbia University School of General Studies, which offered night classes in architecture; after the final out of Game 7, Koufax went straight to Columbia to attend class.

The 1956 season was not very different from 1955 for Koufax. Despite his blazing fastball, Koufax continued to struggle with control. He saw little work, pitching only 58.2 innings with a 4.91 earned run average, 29 walks and 30 strikeouts. When Koufax allowed baserunners, he was rarely permitted to finish the inning. Teammate Joe Pignatano remarked, years later, that as soon as Koufax threw a couple of balls in a row, Walter Alston would signal for a replacement to start warming up in the bullpen.

Notably, teammates Jackie Robinson and Roy Campanella both clashed with Alston on Koufax&#x27;s usage, noting the young pitcher&#x27;s talent and objecting to him being benched for weeks at a time. Pitcher Don Newcombe stated years later that Koufax faced antisemitism as a young pitcher from white players on the team who shunned him and used antisemitic slurs when referring to him. This led to black teammates rallying to Koufax&#x27;s defense and supporting him during his early years.

To prepare him for the 1957 season, the Dodgers sent Koufax to Puerto Rico to play winter ball for the Criollos de Caguas. For the Criollos, Koufax compiled a record of 3–6 with a 4.35 earned run average and 76 strikeouts in 64.2 innings pitched. Two of his wins were shutouts, including a one-hitter and a two-hitter, with Roberto Clemente getting both hits against him in the latter, his last game in Puerto Rico before being released. Besides the Dodgers, the Criollos were the only other team Koufax pitched for in his career.

On May 15, the restriction on sending Koufax down to the minors was lifted. Alston gave him a chance to justify his place on the major league roster by giving him the next day&#x27;s start. Facing the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field, Koufax struck out 13 while pitching his first complete game in almost two years. For the first time in his career, he was in the starting rotation, but only for two weeks. Despite winning three of his next five with a 2.90 earned run average, Koufax did not get another start for 45 days. In that start, he struck out 11 in seven innings, but got no decision. On September 29, he became the last man to pitch for the Brooklyn Dodgers before their move to Los Angeles, throwing an inning of relief in the final game of the season.

Koufax, along with fellow Dodgers pitcher Don Drysdale, served in the United States Army Reserve for two years, from 1957 to 1959. He was often stationed at Fort Dix, New Jersey during the offseason.

Koufax began the 1958 season 7–3, but sprained his ankle in a collision with Jim Bolger of the Chicago Cubs at first base on July 5, resulting in a long layoff. Throughout the season, he was also plagued with back pain which was the result of a benign tumor on his rib cage, necessitating him to undergo surgery in the offseason to have the growth removed. As a result, he finished the season at 11–11 and leading the majors in wild pitches.

In 1959, on June 22, he set the record for a night game with 16 strikeouts against the Philadelphia Phillies. On August 31, against the San Francisco Giants, he broke Dizzy Dean&#x27;s NL single-game record of 17 strikeouts and tied Bob Feller&#x27;s Major League record of 18.

That season, the Dodgers won a tight pennant race against the Giants and the Milwaukee Braves. They faced the Chicago White Sox in the World Series. In his first World Series appearance, Koufax pitched two perfect relief innings in Game 1, though they came after the Dodgers were already behind 11–0. Alston gave Koufax the start in Game 5, at the Los Angeles Coliseum. In what would have been the series-clincher, Koufax allowed only one run in seven innings but lost the game 1–0 when Nellie Fox scored on a double play and the Dodgers failed to score a run in support. Returning to Chicago, the Dodgers won Game 6 and their first championship in Los Angeles.

In early 1960, Koufax asked Dodgers general manager Buzzie Bavasi to trade him because he believed he was not getting enough playing time, a request that was denied. On May 23, he pitched a one-hit shutout against the Pirates, allowing only a second-inning single by pitcher Bennie Daniels and striking out 10 batters in the process. However, the game was a highlight in an otherwise bad year for Koufax in which he went 8–13 with a 3.97 earned run average.

After the last game of the season, frustrated with his lack of progress as well as resentment towards Dodger management, Koufax threw his equipment into the trash, having decided to quit baseball and devote himself to an electronics business in which he had invested. In his first six seasons, he had posted a record of 36–40 with a 4.10 earned run average. Nobe Kawano, the clubhouse supervisor, retrieved the equipment in case Koufax decided to return the following year.

===Domination (1961–1964)===
Koufax came to regret his decision to quit, having found working in the offseason boring. He decided to give baseball another try, remarking years later, &quot;I decided I was really going to find out how good I can be.&quot; During the offseason, Koufax underwent tonsillectomy due to recurring throat issues and, as a result, reported to spring training thirty pounds under his normal playing weight. He later stated that it forced him to regain the lost muscle mass and weight through exercise and nutrition, allowing him to get into the &quot;best shape&quot; of his life. From then on, he made it a point to report to spring training under his playing weight.

During spring training, Dodger scout Kenny Myers discovered a hitch in Koufax&#x27;s windup, where he would rear back so far he would lose sight of the target. As a result, Koufax tightened up his mechanics, believing that not only would it help better his control but would also help him disguise his pitches better. Additionally, Dodgers statistician Allan Roth helped Koufax tweak his game in the early 1960s, particularly regarding the importance of first-pitch strikes and the benefits of breaking pitches.

On March 23, Koufax was chosen to pitch in a B-squad game against the Minnesota Twins in Orlando, Florida, by teammate Gil Hodges who was acting manager for the day. As teammate Ed Palmquist had missed the flight, leaving the team short one pitcher, Hodges told Koufax he needed to pitch at least seven innings. Prior to the game, catcher Norm Sherry told him: &quot;If you get behind the hitters, don&#x27;t try to throw so hard.&quot; This was due to Koufax&#x27;s tendency to lose his temper and throw hard and wildly whenever he got into trouble.

The strategy worked initially before Koufax temporarily reverted to throwing hard and walked the bases loaded with no out in the fifth. Sherry reminded Koufax of their discussion, advising him to settle down and throw to his glove; heeding the advice, Koufax struck out the side and finished the game with seven no-hit innings. He went on to have a strong spring training.

====1961 season====
All the improvements and changes made in the offseason and during spring training resulted in 1961 becoming Koufax&#x27;s breakout season. He posted an 18–13 record and led the majors with 269 strikeouts, breaking Christy Mathewson&#x27;s 58-year-old NL mark of 267, and doing so in 110 innings fewer than Mathewson had.

That season also marked the first time in his career that Koufax started at least 30 games (35) and pitched at least 200 innings (255.2). He lowered his walks allowed per nine innings from 5.1 in 1960 to 3.4 in 1961, led the NL with a strikeout-to-walk ratio of 2.80, and led the majors with a fielding independent pitching mark (FIP) of 3.00.

On September 20, in the last regular season baseball game at the Coliseum, Koufax won a 13-inning contest against the Chicago Cubs for his 18th win of the year. He pitched a complete game, throwing 205 pitches, striking out fifteen batters.

====1962 season====
In 1962, the Dodgers moved from the Los Angeles Coliseum – a football stadium which had a left-field line and a tall screen – to Dodger Stadium. The new park was pitcher-friendly, with a large foul territory and a relatively poor hitting background. Koufax, whose numbers were hurt by the peculiar dimensions of the Coliseum, was an immediate beneficiary of the move. Subsequently, he recorded what would be his first great season, leading the NL in ERA and the majors in hits per nine innings, strikeouts per nine innings, and FIP.

On April 24, Koufax tied his own record of 18 strikeouts in a 10–2 win over the Chicago Cubs in Wrigley Field. On June 13, against the Braves at Milwaukee County Stadium, he hit his first career home run off future Hall of Famer Warren Spahn, providing the winning margin in a 2–1 victory.

On June 30, Koufax threw his first career no-hitter against the expansion New York Mets; it was also the first Dodgers no-hitter since their move to Los Angeles. In the first inning, he threw an immaculate inning, becoming the sixth NL pitcher and the 11th overall to throw one; he remains the only one to do so in a no-hitter. His no-hitter, along with a 4–2 record, 73 strikeouts and a 1.23 ERA, earned him the Player of the Month Award for June. It was the only time in his career he earned this distinction.

Throughout the first half of the season, Koufax dealt with an injured pitching hand. In April, while at bat, he had been jammed by a pitch. A numbness soon developed in his left index finger and it slowly turned cold and pale. Due to his strong performance, Koufax ignored the condition, hoping it would clear up in due time. The condition worsened, however, with his whole hand turning numb by July. During a start against Cincinnati, his finger split open. A vascular specialist determined that Koufax had a crushed artery in his palm. Ten days of experimental medicine successfully reopened the artery, preventing the possibility of amputation.

Koufax was finally able to pitch again in September, when the team was locked in a tight pennant race with the Giants. However, after the long layoff, he was rusty and ineffective in three appearances and, by the end of the regular season and in part due to Koufax&#x27;s absence from the Dodgers rotation, the Giants caught up with the Dodgers and forced a three-game playoff.

With an overworked pitching staff, manager Alston asked Koufax if he could start the first game. Koufax obliged but, still being rusty, was knocked out in the second inning, after giving up home runs to Willie Mays and Jim Davenport. After winning the second game of the series, the Dodgers blew a 4–2 lead in the ninth inning of the deciding third game, losing the pennant.

====1963 season====
In 1963, Major League Baseball expanded the strike zone to combat what they perceived as too much offense. Compared to the previous season, walks in the NL fell 13%, strikeouts increased 6%, the league batting average fell from .261 to .245, and runs scored declined 15%. Koufax, who had reduced his walks allowed per nine innings to 3.4 in 1961 and 2.8 in 1962, reduced it further to 1.7 in 1963, which ranked fifth in the league.

On April 19, Koufax threw his second immaculate inning, this time in a two-hit shutout win against the Houston Colt .45s, becoming the first NL pitcher and the second pitcher ever (after Lefty Grove) to throw two immaculate innings. However, on April 23, he left a game against the Braves after throwing seven scoreless innings due to injuring the posterior capsule of his left shoulder. Koufax subsequently missed two weeks, returning on May 7 against the Cardinals.

Koufax threw his second career no-hitter against the San Francisco Giants on May 11, besting Giants ace Juan Marichal. He carried a perfect game into the eighth inning against the powerful Giants lineup which included future Hall of Famers Willie Mays, Willie McCovey, and Orlando Cepeda. The perfect game ended when he walked catcher Ed Bailey on a full count. Koufax closed out the game after walking pinch-hitter McCovey on four pitches with two out in the ninth.

From July 3 to 16, Koufax pitched 33 consecutive scoreless innings, pitching three shutouts to lower his earned run average to 1.65. On July 20, he hit the second and last home run of his career, coincidentally again in Milwaukee; he hit a three-run shot off Braves pitcher Denny Lemaster to propel the team to a 5–4 win; it was his only game with three runs batted in.

In 1963, Koufax won the first of three pitching Triple Crowns, leading the majors in wins (25), strikeouts (306), and earned run average (1.88). He threw 11 shutouts, eclipsing Carl Hubbell&#x27;s 30-year, post-1900 mark for a left-handed pitcher of 10 and setting a record that stands to this day. Only Bob Gibson, with 13 shutouts in his iconic 1968 season (known as &quot;the year of the pitcher&quot;), has thrown more since.

Koufax won the National League Most Valuable Player Award, and was the first unanimous selection for the Cy Young Award, winning at a time when only one was awarded for both leagues. He was also named the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year for the first time, and was awarded the Hickok Belt as the athlete of the year.

Clinching the pennant on September 27, the Dodgers faced the heavily favored New York Yankees in the 1963 World Series. In Game 1, Koufax beat Whitey Ford 5–2. He struck out the first five batters and 15 overall, breaking Carl Erskine&#x27;s decade-old record of 14. The Dodgers won Games 2 and 3 behind the pitching of Johnny Podres, Ron Perranoski, and Don Drysdale. Koufax completed the Dodgers&#x27; series sweep in Game 4 with a 2–1 victory over Ford; the only run he allowed was a home run by Mickey Mantle.

During the series, Koufax struck out 23 batters in 18 innings, a record for a four-game World Series, and had a 2–0 record with an earned run average of 1.50; for his performance, he was awarded the World Series Most Valuable Player Award.

===Salary dispute===
After his successful 1963 season, Koufax asked the Dodgers for a salary raise to $75,000, later writing in his autobiography: &quot;I felt I was entitled to a healthy raise. Like double of the $35,000 I had received the year before, plus another $5,000 for good measure, good conduct, and good luck. They could hardly say I didn&#x27;t deserve it.&quot; However, during his meeting with Dodgers general manager Buzzie Bavasi, the latter stated Koufax had not earned such a big raise, using numerous excuses to justify his stance, including that he had not pitched enough innings the year before. Bavasi instead offered him $65,000.

Angered at Bavasi&#x27;s reasoning, Koufax held his ground. After tense negotiations, the pair finally agreed to $70,000 and Koufax signed just before the team was about to leave for spring training. Soon after his signing, however, the &quot;Los Angeles Herald-Examiner&quot; published a story which incorrectly stated that Koufax had threatened to retire if he did not get a salary of $90,000. Shocked and angry that the story painted him as greedy, Koufax responded in an interview with Frank Finch of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that he did neither of those things, saying: &quot;I&#x27;ve been hurt by people I thought were my friends.&quot;

The story continued into spring training, with the usually quiet and reserved Koufax telling his side of the negotiations to sportswriters. He strongly suspected that somebody in the front office leaked the story. Koufax dropped the matter only after both Bavasi and Dodgers owner Walter O&#x27;Malley met with him separately. However, due to the bitter negotiations and what he felt was disrespect from the front office, Koufax&#x27;s relationship with both men never fully recovered.

====1964 season====
On April 14, Koufax made the only Opening Day start of his career, pitching a 4–0 shutout against the St. Louis Cardinals. In his next start, he struck out three batters on nine pitches in the third inning of a 3–0 loss to the Cincinnati Reds, becoming the first pitcher in Major League history to throw three immaculate innings. On April 22, in St. Louis, however, Koufax &quot;felt something let go&quot; in his arm during the first inning, resulting in three cortisone shots in his left elbow and three missed starts.

On June 4, against the Philadelphia Phillies in Connie Mack Stadium, Koufax threw his third career no-hitter, tying Bob Feller as the only modern-era pitchers to hurl three no-hitters. He needed just 97 pitches and faced the minimum 27 batters while striking out 12. The only full-count he allowed was to Dick Allen in the fourth inning. Allen walked and was thrown out trying to steal second base; he was the Phillies&#x27; only baserunner that day.

On August 8, during a game against the Milwaukee Braves, Koufax jammed his pitching elbow while diving back to second base to beat a pick-off throw by Tony Cloninger. He managed to pitch and win two more games, but on the morning after his 19th win, a shutout in which he struck out 13 batters, Koufax woke up to find his elbow &quot;as big as his knee&quot; and that he could no longer straighten his arm. He was diagnosed by Dodgers team physician Robert Kerlan with traumatic arthritis. With the Dodgers out of the pennant race, Koufax did not pitch again that season, finishing with a 19–5 win-loss record and leading the National League with a 1.74 ERA and seven shutouts, and the majors with a 2.08 FIP.

===Playing in pain (1965–66)===
After resting during the off-season, Koufax returned to spring training in 1965 and initially had no problems from pitching. On March 30, however, he woke up the morning after pitching a complete game against the Chicago White Sox to find his entire left arm swollen and black and blue from hemorrhaging. He returned to Los Angeles to consult with Kerlan who warned him that he would eventually lose the full use of his arm if he continued to pitch.

Kerlan and Koufax established a schedule which he followed for the last two seasons of his career. Koufax initially agreed to stop throwing between starts but, as it had been a part of his routine for a long time, he soon resumed it. Instead, he stopped throwing sidearm pitches (which he often did against left-handed batters) and removed his rarely-used slider from his repertoire.

Before each start, Koufax had capsaicin-based Capsolin ointment – nicknamed the &quot;Atomic Balm&quot; by players – rubbed onto his shoulder and arm. Afterwards, he soaked his arm in a tub of ice to prevent swelling; during the ice treatments, he often wore a rubber sleeve fashioned from an inner tube to prevent frostbite. If his elbow swelled up after a game, the fluid would be drained with a syringe. When necessary, he was also given a cortisone shot in the elbow joint. For the pain, Koufax took Empirin with codeine every night and occasionally during a game. He also took Butazolidin, a drug used to treat inflammation caused by arthritis which was eventually taken off the market due to its toxic side effects.

====1965 season====
Despite the constant pain in his pitching elbow, Koufax pitched a major league-leading 335.2 innings and 27 complete games, leading the Dodgers to another pennant. He won his second pitching Triple Crown, leading the Majors in wins (26), earned run average (2.04), and strikeouts (382). Koufax captured his second unanimous Cy Young Award, and was runner-up for the National League MVP Award, behind Willie Mays.

Koufax&#x27;s 382 strikeouts broke Rube Waddell&#x27;s modern record of 349 strikeouts in 1904, and was the highest modern-day total at the time. He walked only 71 batters, the first time a pitcher struck out 300 more batters than he walked (311). Additionally, he held batters to 5.79 hits per nine innings, and allowed the fewest baserunners per nine innings in any season ever: 7.83, breaking his own record (set two years earlier) of 7.96.

Koufax was the pitcher for the Dodgers during the game on August 22, when Giants pitcher Juan Marichal clubbed Dodgers catcher John Roseboro in the head with a bat. The game, which came in the middle of a heated pennant race, had been tense since it began, with Marichal brushing back Dodgers outfielder Ron Fairly and shortstop Maury Wills, and Koufax retaliating by throwing over the head of Willie Mays. After Koufax&#x27;s retaliation, both benches were warned by umpire Shag Crawford; despite this, he asked Roseboro, &quot;Who do you want me to get?&quot; Not wanting Koufax ejected in the middle of a crucial game, Roseboro replied, &quot;I&#x27;ll handle it.&quot;

After the clubbing occurred, Koufax rushed from the mound and attempted to grab the bat from Marichal. A fourteen-minute brawl ensued in which he and Mays attempted to restore peace, with Mays dragging the injured Roseboro away from the fight. After the game resumed, a shaken Koufax walked two batters before giving up a three-run home run to Mays. While he eventually settled down and pitched a complete game without allowing more runs, the Dodgers lost the game 4–3.

=====Perfection=====

On September 9, 1965, Koufax became the sixth pitcher of the modern era, and eighth overall, to throw a perfect game. The game, pitched against the Chicago Cubs, was Koufax&#x27;s fourth no-hitter, setting a then-major league record, and the first by a left-hander in the modern era. He struck out 14 batters, the most recorded in a perfect game, and at least one batter in each inning in the 1–0 win.

The game also set a record for the fewest hits in a major league contest as Cubs pitcher Bob Hendley pitched a one-hitter and allowed only two batters to reach base. Both pitchers had no-hitters intact until the seventh inning. The winning run was unearned, scored in the fifth inning without a hit when Dodgers left fielder Lou Johnson walked, reached second on a sacrifice, stole third, and scored on a throwing error by Cubs catcher Chris Krug. The only hit was a bloop double by Johnson to shallow right in the seventh inning.

=====World Series and Yom Kippur decision=====
The Dodgers won the NL pennant on the second-to-last game of the season, against the Milwaukee Braves. Koufax started the game on two days&#x27; rest and pitched a complete game 3–1 win, striking out 13, to clinch the pennant for the Dodgers.

Koufax garnered national attention when he declined to start Game 1 of the 1965 World Series as it clashed with Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar. Instead, Drysdale pitched the opener, but was hit hard by the Minnesota Twins. When Dodgers manager Walter Alston came out to remove Drysdale from the game, the latter quipped: &quot;I bet right now you wish I was Jewish, too.&quot;

In Game 2, Koufax pitched six innings, giving up two runs (one unearned); the Twins won 5–1 to take an early 2–0 lead in the series. The Dodgers fought back in Games 3 and 4, with wins by Claude Osteen and Drysdale. With the Series tied at 2–2, Koufax pitched a four-hit shutout in Game 5, striking out 10 batters, for a 3–2 Dodgers lead.

The Series returned to Metropolitan Stadium for Game 6, which the Twins&#x27; Jim Grant won to force a seventh, decisive game. For the series clincher, Alston decided to start Koufax on two days&#x27; rest over the fully-rested Drysdale against the Twins&#x27; Jim Kaat. Pitching through fatigue and chronic pain, he threw a three-hit shutout with 10 strikeouts, despite the fact he did not have his curveball and relied almost entirely on his fastball.

For his performance, Koufax won the World Series MVP Award, the first player to be awarded it multiple times. Koufax also won the Hickok Belt for a second time, also the first time anyone won the belt more than once. That year, he was named the Sportsman of the Year by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; and Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year for a second time.

===Holdout===

In the offseason, prior to the 1966 season, Koufax and Drysdale met separately with general manager Buzzie Bavasi to negotiate their contracts for the upcoming season. Koufax still harbored ill feelings towards Bavasi stemming from his contract dispute before the 1964 season. After his meeting, he met Drysdale and his wife Ginger for dinner, irritated that Bavasi was using his own teammate against him in the salary negotiations. Drysdale responded that Bavasi had done the same thing with him. After comparing notes, they realized that Bavasi had played each pitcher against the other.

Ginger Drysdale, who had worked as a model and actress and was once a member of the Screen Actors Guild, suggested the pair negotiate together to get what they wanted. Hence, in January 1966, Koufax and Drysdale informed the Dodgers of their decision to hold out together.

In a highly unusual move for the time, they were represented by entertainment lawyer J. William Hayes, Koufax&#x27;s business manager. Also unusual was their demand of $1 million ($ million today), divided equally over the next three years, or $167,000 ($ million today) each for each of the next three seasons. They told Bavasi they would negotiate their contracts as one unit through their agent. The Dodgers refused to do so, stating it was against their policy, and a stalemate ensued. The front office began to wage a public relations campaign against the pair.

Koufax and Drysdale did not report to spring training in February 1966. Instead, both signed to appear in the movie &quot;Warning Shot&quot;. Additionally, Koufax had signed a book deal to write his autobiography, &quot;Koufax&quot;, with author Ed Linn. Meanwhile, Hayes unearthed a state law, the result of the &quot;De Havilland v. Warner Bros. Pictures&quot; case, that made it illegal to extend personal service contracts in California beyond seven years; he began to prepare a lawsuit which to challenge the reserve clause. When Dodgers owner Walter O&#x27;Malley found out about this, the team&#x27;s front office softened their stance towards the pair.

Actor and former baseball player Chuck Connors helped arrange a meeting between Bavasi and the two pitchers. Koufax gave Drysdale the go-ahead to negotiate new deals on behalf of both of them. At the end of the thirty-two day holdout, Koufax signed for $125,000 ($ million today) and Drysdale for $110,000 ($ million today). The deal made Koufax the highest paid player in Major League Baseball for 1966.

The holdout was the first significant event in baseball&#x27;s labor movement and the first time major league players challenged the absolute stronghold the owners held in baseball at the time. That same year, trade unionist Marvin Miller used the Koufax–Drysdale holdout as an argument for collective bargaining while campaigning for players&#x27; votes during spring training; he would soon be elected by the players as first executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association.

====1966 season====
In April 1966, Kerlan told Koufax it was time to retire and that his arm could not take another season. By this time, Koufax could no longer straighten his arm and it occasionally went numb, causing him to drop anything he was holding. Koufax kept Kerlan&#x27;s advice to himself, having decided the year before to make 1966 his last season. He went out to pitch every fourth day, accumulating 323 innings and not missing a start.

He posted a 27–9 win-loss record, with 317 strikeouts and a 1.73 earned run average, and won his third pitching Triple Crown. Koufax won his third unanimous Cy Young Award, the first pitcher ever to win three, and was again runner-up for the National League MVP Award, finishing behind Roberto Clemente of the Pirates.

On September 25, the day after Yom Kippur, Koufax matched up with Ken Holtzman of the Chicago Cubs, a fellow Jewish southpaw. At Wrigley Field, Koufax allowed only two runs (one unearned), both in the first inning, but lost by a 2–1 score. Holtzman carried a no-hitter into the 9th, allowing only one run and one hit. It was Koufax&#x27;s last regular season loss.

In the final game of the regular season, the Dodgers had to beat the Phillies to win the pennant. In the second game of a doubleheader, Koufax faced Jim Bunning for the second time that season. On two days&#x27; rest, Koufax pitched a 6–3 complete-game victory to clinch the pennant, the final win of his career.

During the fifth inning, Koufax injured his back while pitching to Gary Sutherland who was pinch-hitting for Bunning. After the inning, he went to the trainer&#x27;s room where the injury was diagnosed as a slipped disc. Dodger trainers Bill Buehler and Wayne Anderson applied Capsolin on his back and, along with former Dodger Don Newcombe, pulled Koufax in opposite directions until the disc slipped back into place.

The Dodgers went on to face the Baltimore Orioles in the 1966 World Series. As Koufax had pitched the pennant clincher just three days earlier, Walter Alston was reluctant to start him in Game 1 for what would have been two consecutive starts on two days&#x27; rest. Instead, Drysdale started in Koufax&#x27;s place; he proved to be ineffective, however, recording only six outs and losing 5–2.

In Game 2, his third start in eight days, Koufax shut out the Orioles for the first four innings. However, three errors by Dodgers centerfielder Willie Davis in the fifth inning produced three unearned runs. The only earned run allowed by Koufax was the result of Davis losing a fly ball hit by Frank Robinson which fell for a triple; Robinson subsequently scored on a single by Boog Powell. Koufax did not receive any run support either; Baltimore&#x27;s 20-year-old future Hall of Famer Jim Palmer pitched a four-hit shutout, and the Orioles won 6–0.

Alston lifted Koufax at the end of the sixth inning with the idea of getting him extra rest before a potential fifth game. Instead, the Dodgers were swept in four games. Claude Osteen and Drysdale both lost by a score of 1–0 in Games 3 and 4 respectively, with the offense failing to score a single run after having scored just two in Game 1.

===Retirement===
On November 18, 1966, Koufax announced his retirement from baseball in a press conference at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel. He cited the treatments that were required to make it possible for him pitch regularly and the possibility of losing the use of his arm as the reasons for retiring at age 30:

With the Dodgers touring Japan at the time, nobody from the team&#x27;s front office was present at the press conference. Koufax, who told Buzzie Bavasi of his decision a few days before the conference, refused his request to delay his retirement until after the winter meetings in order to facilitate a few deals in the Dodgers&#x27; favor or to wait until owner Walter O&#x27;Malley returned from Japan, having already once delayed it and feeling he was being deceitful to sportswriters asking him about his future plans. In turn, Bavasi refused to attend the conference.

The announcement of his retirement came as a shock, particularly to his teammates. Soon afterwards, Koufax told an incredulous Dick Tracewski, his old Dodger roommate, that he could have continued to pitch but would have risked disability if he did so: &quot;My arm still hurts. I can&#x27;t go on doing this medication thing and pitching. It&#x27;s going to kill me... Lots of bad things could happen. I just gotta retire.&quot; Years later, Koufax stated that he never regretted retiring when he did but did regret having to make the decision to retire.

Koufax&#x27;s retirement ended a five-year run in which he went 111–34 with a 1.95 earned run average and 1,444 strikeouts. During that run, he led the Dodgers to three National League pennants and two World Series titles, in both of which he was named the series MVP. He won Cy Young Awards in each of the pennant-winning years and also won the NL Most Valuable Player Award in 1963.

==Career overall==
===Statistics and achievements===
In his 12-season major league career, Koufax had a 165–87 record with a 2.76 earned run average, 2,396 strikeouts, 137 complete games, and 40 shutouts. He was the first pitcher to average fewer than seven hits allowed per nine innings pitched (6.79) and to strike out more than nine batters (9.28) per nine innings pitched, retiring with more career strikeouts than innings pitched. For the 1960s, he had the lowest ERA (2.36) and lowest WHIP (1.005) of any pitcher with at least 1,200 innings pitched and the third-most strikeouts in the decade (1,910) despite not pitching after 1966.

Koufax was the first pitcher to win three Cy Young Awards, an especially impressive feat as it was during the era when only one was given out for both major leagues. He was also the first pitcher to win the award by a unanimous vote, a distinction which he received twice more.

He became the first pitcher in baseball history to have two games with 18 or more strikeouts, and the first to have eight games with at least 15 strikeouts (now fourth-most all-time). He also set a then-record of 97 games with at least 10 strikeouts (now sixth-most all-time). In his last ten seasons, from 1957 to 1966, batters hit .203 against him, with a .271 on-base percentage and a .315 slugging average. His run of five consecutive ERA titles is a Major League record. He also led the majors in WHIP four consecutive times and FIP six consecutive times, both also records.

Since the start of the live-ball era, Koufax is one of only nine pitchers to record multiple 10+ WAR seasons. He is also the only one to record an ERA under 1.90 in three different qualifying seasons. In each of his last ten seasons, from 1957 to 1966, Koufax finished top ten in strikeouts, including top three finishes in seven; this was despite him being a part-time starter in three of those seasons and suffering a season-shortening injury in two. From 1961 to 1966, he recorded six consecutive 200-strikeout seasons.

Koufax is considered one of the greatest big game pitchers in baseball history. Sabermetrician Bill James described Koufax as having a bigger impact on pennant races than any other pitcher in the 20th and 21st centuries, and though his record across four World Series is 4–3, his 0.95 ERA and two World Series MVP Awards testify to how well he actually pitched. In his three losses, Koufax only gave up one earned run in each; the Dodgers scored only one run in support across the three games, getting shut out twice. His 22 consecutive World Series scoreless innings streak is the fourth-longest in World Series history and ninth-longest in postseason history.

He was selected as an All-Star for six consecutive seasons and made seven out of eight possible All-Star Game appearances those seasons. Koufax pitched six innings across four All-Star games; he was the winning pitcher in the 1965 All-Star Game, and was the starting pitcher in the 1966 All-Star Game, throwing three innings of one-run ball on two days&#x27; rest.

===Pitching style and repertoire===
Koufax was a power pitcher and threw with a pronounced straight-over-the-top arm action. Most of his velocity came from his strong legs and back, combined with a high leg kick during his wind-up and long forward extension on his release point toward home plate. His unusually large hands also allowed him to put heavy spin on his pitches and control the direction in which they would break.

Reserved and shy by nature, Koufax was a fierce competitor on the mound. He once pushed back on his &quot;gentle competitor&quot; image, saying: &quot;It sure as hell isn&#x27;t &#x27;gentle&#x27;, especially playing the game.&quot; Though not a headhunter like teammate Don Drysdale, contrary to belief, he did not hesitate to pitch inside or brush back an opponent, once remarking: &quot;The art of pitching is instilling fear.&quot;

Throughout his career, Koufax relied heavily on two pitches. His four-seam fastball gave batters the impression of rising as it approached them, due to heavy backspin he created by pulling on the seams. His overhand curveball, spun with the middle finger, dropped vertically 12 to 24 inches due to his arm action; it is considered by many as being the best curve of all time.

Though he had a changeup, Koufax almost never threw it, eventually replacing it with a forkball which he used more regularly as a third pitch. Shortstop Roy McMillan described its movement as being not unlike that of a spitball. In his final seasons, Koufax also began throwing a cutter to compensate for lost velocity.

==Post-playing activities==
Soon after his retirement, Koufax signed a 10-year contract with NBC for $1 million ($ million today) to be a broadcaster on the &quot;Saturday Game of the Week&quot;. During his tenure, he also served as the color commentator for the All-Star Game and as a pre-game analyst for the World Series.

A shy man, Koufax was never comfortable on the air; he had difficulty talking baseball with people who had not played the game professionally. It was also challenging for him to describe pitchers whose repertoires and style of pitching differed from his, and to be critical of players he had played with and against. As a result, he quit after six years and his contract with NBC was terminated by mutual consent before the 1973 season.

In 1979, Koufax was hired by the Dodgers as a minor league pitching coach in their farm system. During his tenure, he worked with a number of pitchers, including Orel Hershiser, Dave Stewart, John Franco, Bob Welch, and fellow Hall of Famers Don Sutton and Pedro Martínez. Koufax, with the help of former teammate Roger Craig, taught himself how to throw a split-finger fastball, a popular pitch in the 1980s, in order to be able to teach it to pitchers in the Dodgers&#x27; minor league system.

He resigned from his position in 1990, saying he was not earning his keep as the Dodgers had cut back his workload; most observers, however, blamed it on his uneasy relationship with manager Tommy Lasorda who reportedly resented Koufax working with his pitchers. Despite this, Koufax continued to make informal visits to spring training.

During this time, Koufax also began to make spring training visits with other teams, particularly with the New York Mets who were then owned by his childhood friend Fred Wilpon. Notably, Mets pitcher Al Leiter credited Koufax for helping him become a better pitcher.

In 2002, the &quot;New York Post&quot; published a false story about Koufax in connection to a biography on him by sportswriter Jane Leavy, titled &quot;Sandy Koufax: A Lefty&#x27;s Legacy&quot;, insinuating that he only agreed to cooperate because Leavy threatened to out him as gay if he did not. The &quot;Post&quot; retracted the story after Leavy denied there was such a deal, calling it &quot;thoroughly erroneous on all counts.&quot; Koufax cut ties with the Dodgers as both the team and the newspaper were, at the time, owned by Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corp and he did not want to help promote any of their subsidiaries. He reconnected with the organization in 2004, when the News Corp sold the Dodgers to Frank McCourt.

Prior to the 2013 season, the Dodgers again hired Koufax, this time in a front office role as a special advisor to team chairman Mark Walter, to work with pitchers during spring training at Camelback Ranch and consult during the season. During one spring training visit in 2014, Koufax was hit on the head by a stray line drive, resulting in a cut on his head. He underwent a precautionary CT scan and returned to the spot where he had been hit the following day. Koufax retired from the front office role prior to the 2016 season.

Since its founding, Koufax has been closely involved with the activities of the Baseball Assistance Team (B.A.T.), a non-profit organization dedicated to helping former baseball players through financial and medical difficulties. He has served as a member of its advisory board, and has been a regular attendee at the annual B.A.T. dinner.

==Honors and recognition==

Koufax was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in , his first year of eligibility. At 36 years and 20 days old, he became the youngest person ever elected, five months younger than Lou Gehrig was at the time of his special election in December 1939. He was also the second Jewish player elected to the Hall of Fame, after Hank Greenberg who was elected in .

On June 4, 1972, the Dodgers retired Koufax&#x27;s uniform number 32, alongside those of Roy Campanella (39) and Jackie Robinson (42). On June 18, 2022, a statue of Koufax was unveiled at Dodger Stadium, next to that of Robinson, his former teammate.

In 1999, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; placed Koufax at number 26 on its list of &quot;Baseball&#x27;s 100 Greatest Players&quot;. That same year, he was also named one of 30 players on the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In 2020, &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked Koufax at number 70 on its &quot;Baseball 100&quot; list, complied by sportswriter Joe Posnanski.

Koufax was voted as one of the four greatest living players by Major League Baseball fans, alongside Willie Mays, Henry Aaron, and Johnny Bench, as a part of the 2015 season&#x27;s &quot;Franchise Four&quot; vote. Before the 2015 All-Star Game in Cincinnati, he threw the ceremonial first pitch to Bench from in front of the base of the mound.

In 2022, as part of their SN Rushmore project, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; named Koufax on their &quot;Los Angeles Mount Rushmore of Sports&quot;, along with Los Angeles Lakers basketball players Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Kobe Bryant. Sportswriter Scott Miller described him as &quot;Los Angeles&#x27; first baseball icon&quot;, adding: &quot;Without even trying, he&#x27;s been the epitome of being California cool. Just comes naturally to him.&quot; That same year, MLB.com writers voted Koufax as being the greatest player in Dodgers franchise history, just ahead of Jackie Robinson:

==Legacy==
===Impact within the Jewish community===
Koufax&#x27;s importance in the Jewish community came from his athleticisim; Jewish men were stereotyped as being weak and unathletic and Koufax, who became a star athlete sixteen years after the Shoah, helped break that image. His sitting out Game 1 of the 1965 World Series due to it falling on Yom Kippur helped cement his status as an icon for American Jews. Rabbi Rebecca Alpert explained the significance of his decision in 2014:

Rabbi Bruce Lustig told biographer Jane Leavy that Koufax helped change the perception of Jews: &quot;Think of the stereotype of the Jew in literature. The ugly avariciousness of Shylock. He broke so many of them. Here was a good-looking Jew, a lefty, very powerful on the mound; a perfect player, an enigma, a man who didn&#x27;t reach for fame or money. He broadened the concept of what a Jew was.&quot;

Koufax was inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 1979, and in the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 1993. In 1990, he was inducted in the inaugural class of the Southern California Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.

Koufax&#x27;s likeness is a part of the mural outside Canter&#x27;s Deli in Fairfax, Los Angeles which commemorates the history of the Jewish community in the city.

On May 27, 2010, Koufax was among the group of prominent Jewish Americans honored at the White House reception for Jewish American Heritage Month. In his opening remarks, President Barack Obama directly acknowledged the high esteem in which Koufax is held within the Jewish community: &quot;This is a pretty... distinguished group. We&#x27;ve got senators and representatives. We&#x27;ve got Supreme Court justices and successful entrepreneurs, rabbinical scholars, Olympic athletes – and Sandy Koufax.&quot; The mention of Koufax&#x27;s name drew the loudest cheer in the room.

That same year, he was one of two main subjects of the film &quot;Jews and Baseball: An American Love Story&quot;, alongside Hall of Famer Hank Greenberg of the Detroit Tigers. Koufax agreed to sit down for a rare interview, remarking to Ira Berkow, the writer of the film: &quot;It doesn&#x27;t make sense if it&#x27;s &#x27;Jews and Baseball&#x27; and I&#x27;m not in it.&quot;

===Relationship with fellow minorities===
Since early in his career, Koufax was seen as an ally to minority players by both teammates and opponents. Maury Wills recalled that, after games, the pair would go through each other&#x27;s mail and sort out racist and antisemitic ones. Pitcher Joe Black, who mentored Koufax during his first spring training, said that &quot;If he was in a restaurant, he would never shy away from sitting with the colored fellas.&quot; Cheesy Kawano, wife of clubhouse manager Nobe who used to help her husband out at Dodger Stadium, noted that Koufax was the only player on the team who knew her name and asked after her. His reputation for treating everyone with equal respect prompted catcher Earl Battey, a former World Series opponent, to say of him: &quot;I accused him of being black. I told him he was too cool to be white.&quot;

Leavy stated that Koufax identified with minorities because he himself was one. One of the few Jewish players in baseball, he dealt with antisemitism from both within his team as well as from the outside: &quot;More than one of his African-American peers attributed Koufax&#x27;s rectitude and reticence to his being a minority... If Koufax had been a White Anglo-Saxon Protestant who played clean and kept his nose clean, he&#x27;d have been proclaimed the second coming of Jack Armstrong. But he was a Jew. So he was moody, aloof, curt, intellectual, different&quot; and, as teammate Lou Johnson noted, held to a higher standard like any other minority. In other words, he &quot;identified with [them] as much as they identified with him.&quot;

==In media culture==
===Television appearances===
During his playing career, Koufax made a number of appearances in television programs. In 1959, he appeared as a character named Ben Cassidy in the television series &quot;Shotgun Slade&quot;. The following year, he made three television cameos: in &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot; as a policeman, in &quot;Bourbon Street Beat&quot; as a doorman, and in &quot;Colt .45&quot; as a character called Johnny.

Twice, Koufax made appearances as himself on television series. In 1962, he appeared on &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; in the episode &quot;Dennis and the Dodger&quot; in which he coached a little league team. In 1963, he had a non-speaking role on &quot;Mister Ed&quot; in the episode &quot;Leo Durocher Meets Mister Ed&quot; in which he gave up an inside-the-park home run to the title character, a talking horse.

After the 1963 World Series, Koufax, along with teammates Don Drysdale and Tommy Davis, appeared in a sketch on &quot;The Bob Hope Show&quot; with comedian Bob Hope before performing a dance routine. After their joint holdout in 1966, Koufax and Drysdale appeared on &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot;, with host Gene Barry and comedian Milton Berle.

===Cultural references===
In 1965, as part of &quot;The Sound of the Dodgers&quot;, an album with songs dedicated to the team, comedian and singer Jimmy Durante recorded a song about Koufax called &quot;Dandy Sandy&quot;.

Koufax, along with Whitey Ford, is one of the central figures in Robert Pinsky&#x27;s poem &quot;The Night Game&quot;. Though not named explicitly named, Pinsky alluded to Koufax in the final stanza as a &quot;solution&quot; to Ford whom he refers to in the poem as being &quot;aristocratic&quot; and &quot;gentile&quot;:

In the 1975 film, &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest, after not being allowed to watch it on television, Jack Nicholson&#x27;s character Randle McMurphy narrates an imaginary account of the 1963 World Series in which Koufax gets knocked out of the game after surrendering a double and two home runs to three consecutive Yankees.

In the 1998 film, &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;, John Goodman&#x27;s character Walter Sobchak mentions Koufax in his response to being told he was &quot;living in the fucking past&quot;: &quot;Three thousand years of beautiful tradition from Moses to Sandy Koufax...You&#x27;re goddamn right I&#x27;m living in the fucking past!&quot;

Koufax is referenced in the television show &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;″s episode &quot;Palestinian Chicken&quot; (S8 E3) when Larry David&#x27;s character incredulously asks Marty Funkhouser, played by Bob Einstein, &quot;You&#x27;re Koufaxing us?&quot; after Marty decides against participating in a golf tournament due to it coinciding with the Shabbat.

==Personal life==
Koufax was raised in a secular Jewish household and did not have a bar mitzvah. Biographer Jane Leavy described him as being a &quot;very Jewish being&quot; who was &quot;very Jewish in his thinking.&quot; His grandfather Max Lichtenstein, an immigrant with socialist views, instilled Jewish values and culture in his grandson, often taking Koufax to the Yiddish theatre and concerts.

His refusal to pitch on Jewish holidays throughout his career was made out of respect for his culture rather than religious devotion. According to friends, Koufax would later become an avid reader of Jewish and Holocaust literature.

Despite being one of the biggest stars in America during his career, Koufax has kept a low profile since retirement, rarely granting interviews and making public appearances sparingly. Even during his career he was known for being shy and reserved, resulting in the perception that Koufax was reclusive and aloof. According to Leavy, Koufax was simply uncomfortable with celebrity and refuses to &quot;cannibalize himself for profit.&quot; Koufax himself has dismissed the perception, once remarking: &quot;My friends don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m a recluse.&quot;

A smoker during his playing days, Koufax refused to endorse tobacco or be photographed smoking, feeling it would send the wrong message to children who idolized him. He also refused to endorse alcoholic products.

In 1962, to supplement his player&#x27;s salary, Koufax invested in the Tropicana Motor Inn in West Hollywood. He also founded the KNJO radio station in Thousand Oaks, California, one of the first FM radio stations to broadcast in stereo. Koufax sold both the station and motel in the late 1960s, after his retirement from baseball.

Koufax has been married three times. In 1969, he married Anne Widmark, daughter of actor Richard Widmark; they divorced in 1982. His second marriage, to personal trainer Kimberly Francis, lasted from 1985 to 1998. He married his third wife, Jane Clarke (née Purucker), in 2008. Koufax has no biological children but is the stepfather of Clarke&#x27;s daughter from her previous marriage to artist John Clem Clarke and has two step-grandchildren.

In 2009, Koufax was listed amongst the clients who had invested with financier Bernie Madoff and was one of the victims of his Ponzi scheme. His close friend, Mets owner Fred Wilpon had recommended to Koufax that he invest with Madoff. Despite this, Koufax supported Wilpon and offered to testify on behalf of the Mets&#x27; ownership before a settlement averted a civil trial.

He currently resides in Vero Beach, Florida, and lives part-time in Hellertown, Pennsylvania.

In his forties and fifties, Koufax became an exercise enthusiast. He took up running to stay in shape, taking part in marathons both at home and abroad. A lifelong golfer, he often entered amateur golf championships and participated in charity pro-am tournaments and still remains active in the sport. A college basketball fan, he regularly attends the NCAA Final Four championships.

Koufax is also a wine enthusiast, with an extensive knowledge on the topic, and reportedly brings a different bottle of wine to The Otesaga Hotel Hall of Fame dinner whenever he attends the annual induction ceremony.
