<text>In Greek mythology, Echidna (; , ) was a monster, half-woman and half-snake, who lived alone in a cave. She was the mate of the fearsome monster Typhon and was the mother of many of the most famous monsters of Greek myth.

==Genealogy==
Echidna&#x27;s family tree varies by author. The oldest genealogy relating to Echidna, Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot; (c. 8th – 7th century BC), is unclear on several points. According to Hesiod, Echidna was born to a &quot;she&quot; who was probably meant by Hesiod to be the sea goddess Ceto, making Echidna&#x27;s likely father the sea god Phorcys; however the &quot;she&quot; might instead refer to the Oceanid Callirhoe, which would make Medusa&#x27;s offspring Chrysaor the father of Echidna. The mythographer Pherecydes of Athens (5th century BC) has Echidna as the daughter of Phorcys, without naming a mother.

Other authors give Echidna other parents. According to the geographer Pausanias (2nd century AD), Epimenides (7th or 6th century BC) had Echidna as the daughter of the Oceanid Styx (goddess of the river Styx) and one Peiras (otherwise unknown to Pausanias), while according to the mythographer Apollodorus (1st or 2nd century AD), Echidna was the daughter of Tartarus and Gaia. In one account, from the Orphic tradition, Echidna was the daughter of Phanes (the Orphic father of all gods).

==Description==
Hesiod&#x27;s Echidna was half beautiful maiden and half fearsome snake. Hesiod described &quot;the goddess fierce Echidna&quot; as a flesh eating &quot;monster, irresistible&quot;, who was like neither &quot;mortal men&quot; nor &quot;the undying gods&quot;, but was &quot;half a nymph with glancing eyes and fair cheeks, and half again a huge snake, great and awful, with speckled skin&quot;, who &quot;dies not nor grows old all her days&quot;. Hesiod&#x27;s apparent association of the eating of raw flesh with Echidna&#x27;s snake half suggests that he may have supposed that Echidna&#x27;s snake half ended in a snake-head. Aristophanes (late 5th century BC), who makes her a denizen of the underworld, gives Echidna a hundred heads (presumably snake heads), matching the hundred snake heads Hesiod says her mate Typhon had.

In the Orphic account (mentioned above), Echidna is described as having the head of a beautiful woman with long hair and a serpent&#x27;s body from the neck down. Nonnus, in his &quot;Dionysiaca&quot;, describes Echidna as being &quot;hideous&quot; with &quot;horrible poison&quot;.

==Offspring==

According to Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, the &quot;terrible&quot; and &quot;lawless&quot; Typhon &quot;was joined in love to [Echidna], the maid with glancing eyes&quot; and she bore &quot;fierce offspring&quot;. First there was Orthrus, the two-headed dog who guarded the Cattle of Geryon, second Cerberus, the multiheaded dog who guarded the gates of Hades, and third the Lernaean Hydra, the many-headed serpent who, when one of its heads was cut off, grew two back. The &quot;Theogony&quot; mentions a second ambiguous &quot;she&quot; as the mother of the Chimera (a fire-breathing beast that was part lion, part goat, and had a snake-headed tail) which may refer to Echidna, though possibly the Hydra or even Ceto was meant instead. Hesiod next names two more descendants of Echidna, the Sphinx, a monster with the head of a woman and the body of a winged lion, and the Nemean lion, killed by Heracles as his first labor. According to Hesiod, these two were the offspring of Echidna&#x27;s son Orthrus and another ambiguous &quot;she&quot;, read variously as the Chimera, Echidna herself, or again even Ceto. In any case, the lyric poet Lasus of Hermione (6th century BC) has Echidna and Typhon as the parents of the Sphinx, while the playwright Euripides (5th century BC), has Echidna as her mother, without mentioning a father. While mentioning Cerberus and &quot;other monsters&quot; as being the offspring of Echidna and Typhon, the mythographer Acusilaus (6th century BC) adds the Caucasian Eagle that ate the liver of Prometheus. Pherecydes also names Prometheus&#x27; eagle, and adds Ladon (though Pherecydes does not use this name), the dragon that guarded the golden apples in the Garden of the Hesperides (according to Hesiod, the offspring of Ceto and Phorcys).

Later authors mostly retain these offspring of Echidna and Typhon while adding others. Apollodorus, in addition to naming as their offspring Orthrus, the Chimera (citing Hesiod as his source), the Sphinx, the Caucasian Eagle, Ladon, and probably the Nemean lion (only Typhon is named), also adds the Crommyonian Sow, killed by the hero Theseus (unmentioned by Hesiod). Hyginus in his list of offspring of Echidna (all by Typhon), retains from the above Cerberus, the Chimera, the Sphinx, the Hydra and Ladon, and adds &quot;Gorgon&quot; (by which Hyginus means the mother of Medusa, whereas Hesiod&#x27;s three Gorgons, of which Medusa was one, were the daughters of Ceto and Phorcys), the Colchian dragon that guarded the Golden Fleece and Scylla.

Nonnus makes Echidna the mother of an unnamed, venom-spitting, &quot;huge&quot; son, with &quot;snaky&quot; feet, an ally of Cronus in his war with Zeus, who was killed by Ares. The Harpies, in Hesiod the daughters of Thaumas and the Oceanid Electra, in one source, are said to be the daughters of Typhon, and so perhaps were also considered to be the daughters of Echidna. Likewise, the sea serpents which attacked the Trojan priest Laocoön during the Trojan War, which are called by Quintus Smyrnaeus &quot;fearful monsters of the deadly brood of Typhon&quot;, may also have been considered Echidna&#x27;s offspring. Echidna is sometimes identified with the Viper who was the mother by Heracles of Scythes, an eponymous king of the Scythians, along with his brothers Agathyrsus (&quot;much raging&quot;) and Gelonus (see below).

Notes:
==Cave==
According to Hesiod, Echidna was born in a cave and apparently lived alone (in that same cave, or perhaps another), as Hesiod describes it, &quot;beneath the secret parts of the holy earth ... deep down under a hollow rock far from the deathless gods and mortal men&quot;, a place appointed by the gods, where she &quot;keeps guard in Arima&quot;. (Though Hesiod here may possibly be referring to Echidna&#x27;s mother Ceto&#x27;s home cave instead.) It was perhaps from this same cave that Echidna used to &quot;carry off passersby&quot;.

Hesiod locates Echidna&#x27;s cave in Arima (&quot;εἰν Ἀρίμοισιν&quot;). Presumably, this is the same place where, in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, Zeus, with his thunderbolts, lashes the land about Echidna&#x27;s mate Typhon, described as the land of the Arimoi (&quot;εἰν Ἀρίμοις&quot;), &quot;where men say is the couch [bed] of Typhoeus&quot;, Typhoeus being another name for Typhon. But neither Homer nor Hesiod say anything more about where this Arima might be. The question of whether an historical place was meant, and its possible location, has been since ancient times the subject of speculation and debate.

The geographer Strabo (c. 20 AD) discusses the question in some detail. Several locales, Cilicia, Syria, Lydia, and the Island of Pithecussae (modern Ischia), each associated with Typhon in various ways, are given by Strabo as possible locations for Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Arima&quot; (or Homer&#x27;s &quot;Arimoi&quot;).

The region in the vicinity of the ancient Cilician coastal city of Corycus (modern Kızkalesi, Turkey) is often associated with Typhon&#x27;s birth. The poet Pindar (c. 470 BC), who has Typhon born in Cilicia, and nurtured in &quot;the famous Cilician cave&quot; an apparent allusion to the Corycian cave, also has Zeus slaying Typhon &quot;among the Arimoi&quot;. The fourth-century BC historian Callisthenes, located the Arimoi and the Arima mountains in Cilicia, near the Calycadnus river, the Corycian cave and the Sarpedon promontory. The b scholia to &quot;Iliad&quot; 2.783, preserving a possible Orphic tradition, has Typhon born &quot;under Arimon in Cilicia&quot;, and Nonnus mentions Typhon&#x27;s &quot;bloodstained cave of Arima&quot; in Cilicia.

Just across the Gulf of Issus from Corycus, in ancient Syria, was Mount Kasios (modern Jebel Aqra in Turkey) and the Orontes River, said to be the site of the battle of Typhon and Zeus. According to Strabo, the historian Posidonius identified the Arimoi with the Aramaeans of Syria.

According to some, Arima was instead located in a volcanic plain on the upper Gediz River called the Catacecaumene (&quot;Burnt Land&quot;), situated between the ancient kingdoms of Lydia, Mysia and Phrygia, near Mount Tmolus (modern Bozdağ) and Sardis, the ancient capital of Lydia. According to Strabo, some placed the Arimoi and the battle between Typhon and Zeus at Catacecaumene, while Xanthus of Lydia added that &quot;a certain Arimus&quot; ruled there. Strabo also tells us that, according to &quot;some&quot;, Homer&#x27;s &quot;couch of Typhon&quot; (and hence the Arimoi) was located &quot;in a wooded place, in the fertile land of Hyde&quot;, with Hyde being another name for Sardis (or its acropolis), and that Demetrius of Scepsis thought that the Arimoi were most plausibly located &quot;in the Catacecaumene country in Mysia&quot;. The third-century BC poet Lycophron placed Echidna&#x27;s lair in this region.

Another place mentioned by Strabo as being associated with Arima is the volcanic island of Pithecussae, off the coast of ancient Cumae in Italy. According to Pherecydes of Athens, Typhon fled to Pithecussae during his battle with Zeus and, according to Pindar, Typhon lay buried beneath the island. Strabo reports the &quot;myth&quot; that when Typhon &quot;turns his body the flames and the waters, and sometimes even small islands containing boiling water, spout forth&quot;. The connection to Arima comes from the island&#x27;s Greek name Pithecussae, which derives from the Greek word for monkey, and, according to Strabo, residents of the island said that &quot;arimoi&quot; was also the Etruscan word for monkeys.

Quintus Smyrnaeus locates her cave &quot;close on the borders of Eternal Night&quot;.

==Death==
Although for Hesiod Echidna was immortal and ageless, according to Apollodorus Echidna continued to prey on the unfortunate &quot;passers-by&quot; until she was finally killed, while she slept, by Argus Panoptes, the hundred-eyed giant who served Hera.

==The Scythian &quot;echidna&quot;==

From the fifth century BC historian Herodotus, we learn of a creature who, though Herodotus does not name as Echidna, is called an &quot;echidna&quot; (&quot;she-viper&quot;) and resembles the Hesiodic Echidna in several respects. She was half woman half snake, lived in a cave, and was known as a mother figure, in this case, as the progenitor of the Scythians (rather than of monsters).

According to Herodotus, Greeks living in Pontus, a region on the southern coast of the Black Sea, told a story of an encounter between Heracles and this snaky creature. Heracles was driving the cattle of Geryones through what would later become Scythia, when one morning he awoke and discovered that his horses had disappeared. While searching for them, he &quot;found in a cave a creature of double form that was half maiden and half serpent; above the buttocks she was a woman, below them a snake&quot;. She had the horses and promised to return them if Heracles would have sex with her. Heracles agreed and she had three sons by him: Agathyrsus, Gelonus and Scythes. She asked Heracles what she should do with his sons: &quot;shall I keep them here (since I am queen of this country), or shall I send them away to you?&quot;. And Heracles gave her a bow and belt, and told her, that when the boys were grown, whichever would draw the bow and wear the belt, keep him and banish the others. The youngest son Scythes fulfilled the requirements and became the founder and eponym of the Scythians.

==The Viper in the &quot;Acts of Philip&quot;==
A possibly related creature to the Hesiodic Echidna is the &quot;Viper&quot; (&quot;Echidna&quot;) cast into an abyss, by Philip the Apostle, in the apocryphal &quot;Acts of Philip&quot;. Called a &quot;she dragon&quot; (&quot;drakaina&quot;) and &quot;the mother of the serpents&quot;, this Echidna ruled over many other monstrous dragons and snakes, and lived in a gated temple at Hierapolis, where she was worshipped by the people of that land. She, along with her temple and priests, was swallowed up by a hole in the ground that opened beneath her, as the result of Philip&#x27;s curse.

==Delphyne==
Echidna was perhaps associated with the monster killed by Apollo at Delphi. Though that monster is usually said to be the male serpent Python, in the oldest account of this story, the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Apollo&quot;, the god kills a nameless she-serpent (&quot;drakaina&quot;), subsequently called Delphyne, who had been Typhon&#x27;s foster-mother. Echidna and Delphyne share several similarities. Both were half-maid and half-snake, and both were a &quot;plague&quot; (&quot;πῆμα&quot;) to men. And both were intimately connected to Typhon, and associated with the Corycian cave.

==Iconography==
No certain ancient depictions of Echidna survive. According to Pausanias, Echidna was depicted, along with Typhon, on the sixth century BC Doric-Ionic temple complex at Amyclae known as the throne of Apollo, designed by Bathycles of Magnesia. Pausanias identifies two standing figures on the left as Echidna and Typhon, with Tritons standing on the right, with no other details concerning these figures given.

<text>Menudo is a Puerto Rican boy band formed by producer Edgardo Díaz. Referred to as the &quot;most iconic Latino pop music band&quot;, they have been ranked as one of the biggest boy bands of all time by several publications, including &quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;Us Weekly&quot;, &quot;Seventeen&quot;, and &quot;Teen Vogue&quot;, being the only Latin band on their lists.

The band had several radio hits during its career. They acted in a television film (1979&#x27;s &quot;Leyenda de Amor&quot;) and two feature films, &quot;An Adventure Called Menudo&quot; (&quot;Una aventura llamada Menudo&quot;) and &quot;&quot; (&quot;Menudo: La Película&quot;), in three mini series entitled &quot;I Want to Be&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s for Love&quot; and &quot;Forever Friends&quot; (&quot;Quiero Ser&quot;, &quot;Es Por Amor&quot; and &quot;Por Siempre Amigos&quot;) and another television mini-series named &quot;Panchito and Arturo&quot; (&quot;Panchito y Arturo&quot;).

Menudo&#x27;s original lineup consisted of five boys: brothers Fernando and Nefty Sallaberry (ages 12 and 13); the Melendez brothers, Carlos Meléndez, (age 12), Óscar Meléndez, (age 11), and Ricky Meléndez, (age 9); the latter three are Díaz&#x27;s cousins. The band&#x27;s golden-era lineup consisted of members Ricky Meléndez, Johnny Lozada, René Farrait, Miguel Cancel, Xavier Serbiá, Charlie Masso and Ray Reyes. It was also a starting point for popular international stars like Ricky Martin (1984–89) and Draco Rosa (1984–87), who were members of the band in the mid-1980s.

Entering the 1990s their popularity started to wane and allegations of drug use and sexual abuse accusations against Díaz started to surface. In 1997, the rights and the name Menudo were sold. The remaining members continued to perform as MDO until their official disbandment in 2002. However, this iteration has continued to perform sporadically since. New management of Menudo formed a new line-up in 2007, releasing an EP but disbanding in 2009. Some of the members of the &quot;golden era&quot; of the band reunited in 1998 under the name El Reencuentro and in 2019 for the &quot;Get on My Motorcycle&quot; (&quot;Súbete a Mi Moto Tour&quot;).

Menudo is estimated to have sold 20 million albums worldwide and has generated over 300 million US dollars.

==History==
===Beginning and rise to fame===
Menudo was formed in 1977 by music producer Edgardo Díaz. The original line up consisted of 5 members, the Sallaberry brothers, Fernando and Nefty, and Díaz&#x27;s cousins, the Melendez brothers, Oscar, Carlos, and Ricky. They were signed to Padosa Records and released their first album &quot;Los Fantasmas&quot; in 1977. It featured &quot;Teach Me To Sing&quot; (&quot;Enséñame a cantar&quot;), a song by Spanish singer Micky. In 1978 they released another album called &quot;Laura&quot;. Fifteen-year-old Nefty was the very first member to leave and was replaced by 12-year-old René Farrait. In 1979, they released an album called &quot;Little Girl&quot; (&quot;Chiquitita&quot;). At the end of 1979, Carlos left the band at age 15 and was replaced by 12-year-old Johnny Lozada, after which they made their first Christmas album, &quot;Congratulations&quot; (&quot;Felicidades&quot;).

In the early 1980s, Menudo had several hits, including &quot;The Ghosts&quot; (&quot;Los Fantasmas&quot;) and a cover version of ABBA&#x27;s &quot;Do You Want&quot; (&quot;Voulez-Vous&quot;). They filmed three music videos for the song &quot;Little Girl&quot; (&quot;Chiquitita&quot;), including one with Puerto Rican music star Ednita Nazario (who sang with them and played the titular &quot;Chiquitita&quot; on the video). The group then released several moderately successful albums, including &quot;Fuego&quot; (&quot;Fire&quot;), which yielded hits &quot;Ella A-A&quot; (&quot;Her&quot;), &quot;Fuego&quot; (&quot;Fire&quot;), and &quot;A Bailar&quot; (&quot;To Dance&quot;). They also made &quot;Fui Hecho Para Amarte&quot;, which itself was also a cover, in that song&#x27;s case of KISS&#x27;s &#x27;&quot;I Was Made For Lovin&#x27; You&quot;, but that song was not included in &quot;Fuego&quot;, and was released on their &quot;Xanadu&quot; album instead.

During 1981, the group, which by then consisted of René Farrait (14), Johnny Lozada (13), Xavier Serbiá (13), Miguel Cancel (13), and remaining original member Ricky Melendez (13), released &quot;I Want to Be&quot; (&quot;Quiero Ser&quot;). The album would launch Menudo into international stardom. It included hit songs such as &quot;I Want to Be&quot; (&quot;Quiero Ser&quot;), &quot;Get on My Motorcycle&quot; (&quot;Súbete A Mi Moto&quot;), &quot;Rock on TV&quot; (&quot;Rock En La TV&quot;), &quot;Clarity&quot; (&quot;Claridad&quot;), and &quot;My Band Plays Rock&quot; (&quot;Mi Banda Toca Rock&quot;). They also had their own telenovela series entitled &quot;I Want To Be&quot;
(&quot;Quiero Ser&quot;).

In the same year, the group hosted a television show on Telemundo entitled &quot;Menudo Young People&quot; (&quot;Gente Joven de Menudo&quot;). They hosted a yearly beauty pageant, &quot;Menudo&#x27;s young girl&quot; (&quot;La chica joven de Menudo&quot;) and the winner of the pageant would sometimes appear in the band&#x27;s videos or join them onstage at their concerts throughout the United States.

Menudo became very popular throughout Latin America, from Mexico to Argentina, and Brazil. They also became the first boy band to own their own private jet. Díaz, their manager, purchased a Lockheed JetStar that had belonged to American President Richard Nixon and the Shah of Iran. He had Menudo&#x27;s name emblazoned on both sides of the fuselage. In 1982, Charlie Masso, then age 12, replaced René Farrait, age 14. Masso&#x27;s first album with Menudo was &quot;For Love&quot; (&quot;Por Amor&quot;). During this boom of popularity, fans started calling themselves contagious to the &quot;Menuditis&quot;, similar to Beatlemania and Bieber Fever, or the &quot;Menudomania&quot;. They were so popular that they starred in their own feature films: &quot;&quot; and &quot;An Adventure Called Menudo&quot;. &quot;Aventura&quot; starred Gladys Rodríguez as Miss Mia (&quot;Señora Mía&quot;) and included songs such as &quot;Clara&quot; and &quot;Fly&quot; (&quot;A Volar&quot;).

During their first visit to New York in early 1983, Ray Reyes, 12, replaced Xavier Serbiá, 14. Their American fanbase grew, especially among the young, as evidenced by &quot;Menudo on ABC&quot;, a
series of four minute music spots that aired during the Fall 1983 season of ABC&#x27;s youth-oriented Saturday-morning programming block. They also sang the theme song for ABC&#x27;s &quot;Rubik, the Amazing Cube&quot;. Miguel Cancel became the first member to voluntarily quit the group. According to a 1998 interview, he was unhappy that a sudden voice change rendered him unable to sing his songs, so he opted to leave before his scheduled departure. He was replaced by Roy Rosselló, 13. Menudo signed a six-year multimillion-dollar contract with RCA International and released their Spanish album &quot;A Todo Rock&quot; (&quot;Full of Rock&quot;). According to &quot;Time&quot; magazine, at the end of July, the group had already sold 3 million copies worldwide, 750,000 in USA only.

Around that time, Menudo merchandise began to be mass-produced. Merchandise included Menudo dolls, which appeared in the United States and Latin American toy markets in 1984, Menudo Topps trading cards, wristwatches, fotonovelas, fanzines, T-shirts, a 1981 board game named &quot;Menudo Karshow&quot; and other clothing accessories and school supplies. In 1984, Robby Rosa (now known as Draco Rosa), 14, replaced Johnny Lozada, 16, just in time for Menudo to release their first English-language album, &quot;Reaching Out&quot;, which featured the theme track &quot;Like a Cannonball&quot; for the Hollywood movie &quot;Cannonball Run 2&quot;; and their first Portuguese album, &quot;Mania&quot;, both featuring versions of some of their Spanish hits. During the first half of 1984, Menudo toured the U.S. and Brazil. The Spanish version &quot;Como Cannonball&quot; was used in the Filipino youth movie &quot;Bagets 2&quot; and also featured the song &quot;Fly Away&quot;.

On September 16, 1984, Ricky Melendez, 16, the sole remaining original member, left the group. Up until then, he was the only Menudo member to remain with the group for seven years. He was replaced by Ricky Martin, then 12, who debuted on the album, &quot;Evolución &quot;(&quot;Evolution&quot;). During this time, Menudo&#x27;s popularity reached parts of Asia including Japan and the Philippines, and the group made English-language commercials for Pepsi, Scope, Burger King, McDonald&#x27;s, and Crest. They also made a guest appearance on the popular American children&#x27;s program &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. By the end of September, sales of their records surpassed 8 million copies worldwide. Then, much to the surprise of fans and himself, Ray Reyes, 15, departed the group earlier than expected, due to internal conflicts between Ray&#x27;s father and the manager (information recently confirmed by his brother Raúl Reyes). In a 1998 interview, Reyes stated he was surprised when during a Menudo interview in 1985, the interviewer asked who would leave the group next and Edgardo Díaz named Ray. The group also had a weekly television show called &quot;Menudo Mania&quot;.

Raymond Acevedo (13) took over Reyes&#x27; spot in 1985 and Menudo sang vocals for the Spanish-English song &quot;Cantare, Cantaras&quot; (I Will Sing, You Will Sing) with various Latin artists to raise money for UNICEF. This song was the Latin American version of &quot;We Are the World&quot;. &quot;Cantare, Cantaras&quot; was recorded on April 9, 1985, at the A&amp;M Studios. The group released their second English-language album, &quot;Menudo&quot; which contains the songs &quot;Hold Me&quot; (#62 Billboard Hot 100, RCA 14087) and &quot;Explosion&quot;, both with lead vocals by Robi Rosa. They also released their next Spanish album, &quot;Ayer Y Hoy (Yesterday And Today)&quot;, and their second Portuguese album &quot;A Festa Vai Comecar (The Party Is Going To Start)&quot;. They successfully toured Brazil, performing before hundreds of thousands of fans, but there were allegations of the tour being poorly organized: the capacity for a concert in Rio de Janeiro was 60,000 but 70,000 tickets were sold, and 2 women died. In São Paulo, a 100,000-capacity stadium was sold-out with 200,000 people, and in the São Paulo city of Campinas, rain delayed a concert for 4 hours.

In 1986, the song King Holiday was recorded. Later in the year Roy Rosselló (15) was replaced by Sergio Blass (13) but no farewell concert was held. According to a book written by Raymond Acevedo&#x27;s father in 2012 titled &quot;Papi, Quiero Ser Un Menudo,&quot; Roy threatened to expose management irregularities to the press and was given a huge sum of money to leave the group due to his behavior as it was deemed by creator Edgardo Diaz as &quot;uncontrollable.&quot; At this time, Menudo&#x27;s management started bending the rules a little and started allowing members to remain in the group after reaching the age limit. Sergio had been in two Puerto Rican groups prior to joining Menudo; the first being Concepto Juvenil from 1983 to 1985, and then Los Chicos de Puerto Rico, for a few months in 1985. The group released several albums that year, starting with their only Italian album, &quot;Viva! Bravo!&quot;, which they showcased in Italy in the San Remo Music Festival. The Spanish album &quot;Refrescante (Refreshing)&quot;, the English album &quot;Can&#x27;t Get Enough&quot;, and the Portuguese album &quot;Menudo&quot; followed respectively, then came tours of the U.S., Latin America (including Brazil), and the Philippines.

===Internal conflicts and image change===

In January 1987, Ralphy Rodriguez (13) replaced Charlie (17) just as the group began facing internal conflicts. First, Robby (17) quit without warning in the midst of a Brazilian tour, becoming the third member to quit voluntarily. Apparently, he had written a song and presented the idea to management and they turned him down, supposedly mocking him, which prompted him to leave. Robby&#x27;s lawyer prevented them from using his song. Also, the group was dropped from RCA International due to low record sales, so they signed a contract with Melody International Mexico. Charlie was asked to return to the group to complete the Brazilian tour and to embark on the Summer in the Street U.S. tour and introduce new member Rubén Gómez (13).

At that point, the group underwent a complete image makeover, changing their look to a rougher, more rugged, rock-n-roll-like look. Members were Ralphy, Ruben, Ricky Martin, Sérgio and Raymond: this formation became known as Los Hijos Del Rock. Their music, formerly described as bubblegum-pop, underwent a similar change. They released the Spanish album &quot;Somos Los Hijos del Rock (We Are The Sons Of Rock)&quot;, followed by an English-Tagalog album for the Philippines titled &quot;In Action&quot; with Ralphy and Rubén. In late 1987, Ralphy&#x27;s parents pulled him from the group, citing improper treatment by management; this eventually came to light in 1991 with accusations of a Menudo sex scandal. Charlie was again asked to fill in during the Philippines tour, which would be their last as their popularity there waned.

In early 1988, Angelo García (11) replaced Ralphy Rodríguez (14) and they released their final English-language album, &quot;Sons of Rock&quot;, scoring an international hit, &quot;You Got Potential&quot;. Another song, &quot;TLC&quot;, featured lead vocals by Ricky Martin. In August 1988, Raymond Acevedo&#x27;s contract was about to expire, but he decided to leave before auditions were held for his replacement, and Menudo performed as a quartet for a few months before Robert Avellanet (13) took over. The album Sombras Y Figuras was released at the end of the year. During 1989, longtime member Ricky Martin (17) left the group to pursue a solo career. Rawy Torres (13) years old, replaced him and the formation &quot;Los Ultimos Heroes&quot; was born and they released the album Los Últimos Héroes. This formation was a success. They filmed a telenovela of the same name. Future member Jonathan Montenegro acted alongside them.
===1990s&#x27;===
Despite their newfound success, the group kept facing problems: At age 13 during a concert in Caracas, Venezuela, Angelo García left the stage because of the pain of appendicitis; a new member was chosen by Sergio&#x27;s mother and he was César Abreu (13), who only lasted 7 months. Like Sergio, Abreu was in Concepto Juvenil, from 1989 to early 1990. They released another Portuguese album, &quot;Os Ultimos Herois&quot;.

Management was preparing for Sergio&#x27;s departure and debuted the first non-Puerto Rican member, Adrián Olivares (13) of Mexico, who entered the group with the formation of Ruben/Robert/Rawy/Cesar/Adrian, (although Sergio was still, officially, a member) but Abreu suddenly departed just seven months in the group. Management decided to bring Sergio back in (making him the second member to be back in Menudo after Charlie Masso) for another Spanish album, &quot;No Me Corten El Pelo&quot; (Don&#x27;t Cut My Hair) featuring the Sergio/Rubén/Robert/Rawy/Adrián lineup. During this time, Menudo: Edicion Brasil was renamed to Os Ultimos Herois, but Cesar&#x27;s vocals were kept as the cover was changed with Adrian in it and also an additional track sung by Rawy Torres.

In November 22, 1990, two members were arrested at Miami International Airport, Sergio Blass and Ruben Gomez, ages 18 and 16, after a sniffer dog found marijuana in their pockets. It would have been acquired in Mexico while touring with Menudo. This resulted in a scandal and an expulsion from both of the members. In December, two new non-Puerto Rican members joined the group: Edward Aguilera (13) of Spain replaced Sergio Blass (18) (thus becoming the second European-after Fernando Salaberry-to be a member of the band) and Jonathan Montenegro (12) of Venezuela replaced Rubén Gómez (16).

At the end of 1990, with the resignation of Ruben Gomez and Sérgio Blass and the entry of the two new members, a new controversy arose: Jonathan, Edward, Rawy and Robert resigned from Menudo, alleging abuse and mistreatment. This lineup lasted very little, from December 1990 to April 1991, and they didn&#x27;t record any albums. Robert and Rawy went on to create a separate group called Euphoria, Edward&#x27;s singing career fizzled out, and Jonathan continued his acting career. 

Adrian was the only one who remained in the group after he was approached while in Mexico and also was paid the money owed to him. The Management proposed a new lineup with a more international focus and Adrian wanting to be the oldest in the group accepted to come back. Edgardo Díaz left Puerto Rico and held auditions in Miami, Florida, signing Miami teens Alexis Grullón (13), Ashley Ruiz (15), and Andy Blázquez (12), and Pecos, Texas resident Abel Talamántez (12). The first album with the new lineup was &quot;Detrás De Tu Mirada&quot;, which was very successful in the whole continent, especially in Peru. From then on, the Peruvian fanbase was the most important one. 

Menudo continued to work, releasing an English single titled &quot;Dancin&#x27;, Movin&#x27;, Shakin&#x27;&quot;, and a follow-up in 1993, &quot;Cosmopolitan Girl&quot;, on McGillis Records. They also continued to travel through Latin America. In March 1992, Menudo filmed in New York City &quot;The Making of Dancin, Movin, Shakin&quot; for Darrin McGillis Productions. In August 2012, the film was released for free viewing on YouTube.

In 1992, they released &quot;15 Años&quot; (&quot;15 Years&quot;), which would be Adrián&#x27;s last album with the band, when he left in 1993. The album had hits such as &quot;Buscame&quot; and &quot;Lo Que Juramos&quot;. Ricky López (13) replaced Adrián (16) and the group released their fifth Portuguese album &quot;Vem Pra Mim&quot; (&quot;Come to Me&quot;) in 1993. The next year, they released their 22nd Spanish album, &quot;Imaginate...&quot; (&quot;Imagine&quot;), with hits like &quot;Un Hombre Que Sabia Demas&quot;, which is the Spanish version of &quot;Um Homem Que Sabia Demais&quot; from Skank, &quot;Yo Quiero Bailar Reggae&quot;, and &quot;Mil Angeles&quot;, which was dedicated to a fan, Cecilia Lopez, who died at one of their concerts in Peru the year before. 

In 1995, Ricky López (15) quit the group without warning, and again the band performed as a quartet for a few months. Ashley (19) had also decided to leave, so auditions were held and Didier Hernández (16) and Anthony Galindo (16) were chosen. Ashley&#x27;s farewell concert was in Panama, where the new members were presented. In 1996, the group released their last Spanish album under the Menudo name, &quot;Tiempo De Amar&quot; (&quot;Time to Love&quot;). The album was very successful, producing several hit singles. Andy Blázquez (18) was replaced by Daniel René Weider. A spinoff group was formed as MDO. A Spanish album was released titled &quot;MDO&quot;.

===El Reencuentro===
In 1998 Ricky Meléndez, René Farrait, Miguel Cancel, Johnny Lozada, Ray Reyes, and Charlie Massó re-joined to celebrate the 15th anniversary of their success in Latin America, North America, Spain, and several other countries. They planned the reunion concert to take place at Centro de Bellas Artes in the San Juan suburb of Santurce, as an experimental project. They ended up doing the shows at the much larger Coliseo Roberto Clemente in San Juan, instead. They had an unexpected success and performed as an ensemble throughout North and Latin America until August 2015, when the group disbanded due to financial issues. They named this &quot;El Reencuentro&quot; because they could not use the &quot;Menudo&quot; name.

===2000s&#x27;===
In 2000, MDO released their album &quot;Subir Al Cielo&quot; with critical success. The album lead track &quot;Te Quise Olvidar&quot; topped the Billboard Hot Latin Tracks for several weeks. The group follow-up singles &quot;Sin Ti&quot; and &quot;Me Huele a Soledad&quot; also reached the top 10 in the U.S.. In 2002, former members Sergio, Rubén, Robert, Angelo and Rawy reunited under the name &quot;Los Últimos Héroes&quot; giving numerous concerts in Venezuela.

In early 2003, MDO officially broke up on amicable terms. The members wanted to pursue other projects. Edgardo Díaz introduced the new MDO in January 2005. In 2004, Edgardo Díaz announced that he would be bringing a new group with the Menudo formula into the music industry. Initially expecting this new group to be named Menudo, he surprised the press and general public by naming them Tick Tock.

Also in 2004, former Menudo members Roy, Raymond, Rubén, Sergio and Andy reunited under the name and banner: &quot;&quot;. They were based and focused primarily on a series of &#x27;Brazilian&#x27; tours. Sergio left due to his prior commitment with &quot;Los Últimos Héroes&quot;, and was replaced with Anthony Galindo. Andy would later be replaced by former MDO member Caleb Avilés before disbanding in late 2005, early 2006. In January 2005, producer Edgardo Díaz introduced the new MDO with four new members: Daniel Rodríguez, Luis Montes, Elliot Suro, and Lorenzo Duarte. The first three were among the contestants of Puerto Rican reality/talent show &quot;Objetivo Fama&quot;. This latest incarnation of the group achieved great success with their single &quot;Otra Vez&quot; which took them all across Latin America.

Also, in 2005, former Menudo members René, Johnny, Miguel, Ricky, Charlie, and Ray reunited once again to perform the songs that Menudo popularized during their era under the name and banner &quot;El Reencuentro: Momento del Adios&quot; making this their farewell tour. There were plans to bring this production to Latin America and the U.S. Also in 2005, Sergio, Angelo, Robert, Rawy and Adrián reunited again under the name &quot;Los Últimos Héroes&quot; after their successful reunion concerts in 2002.

In 2006, former &quot;&quot; members, Anthony and Rubén reunited and formed the duo &quot;Blacksheep&quot; and continued touring in Brazil. The duo grew a large fan base in both Brazil and Hispanic America. In 2007, a re-release of the 1992 VHS film of Menudo The making of Dancin&#x27;, Movin&#x27;, Shakin&#x27;&quot; was released on McGillis Records. Entitled &quot;Triple Threat DVD/CD Combo&quot;, the box set included the Film on DVD for the first time, along with two music CDs, &quot;Latin Teen Stars&quot; and &quot;Dance Music All Night Long&quot;, featuring hit songs by Menudo, ex-Menudo members. The single, &quot;Dancin&#x27;, Movin&#x27;, Shakin&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;Cosmopolitan Girl&quot; was released digitally on iTunes in May 2009.

In 2007, it was announced that Menudo would return after signing a multi-album contract with Sony Music. That would be directed by Johnny Wright, he was the manager of Justin Timberlake and the new band music was to be a fusion of urban, pop and rock in both English and Spanish. They began promoting the project in cities of the United States and Mexico to attract young singers who wanted to belong to a new band that would sing in Spanish and English. Auditions in different cities such as Los Angeles, Dallas, Miami, New York, among others. In the Dallas audition, radio announcer Daniel Luna and singer Luis Fonsi were part of the selection jury. where they were selected JC Gonzalez and Monti Montañez (Che Antonio).

The 15 semifinalists met in South Beach, Florida to continue preparing with producer Johnny Wright, choreograph Anibal Marrero and voice coach David Coury, participating through a reality show showing the entire process of competition. The re-founding of the band was profiled in a MTV reality series entitled &quot;Making Menudo&quot; that had launched as a primetime series on October 25, 2007, but was later pushed to afternoons due to low ratings. The series aired ten episodes, ending on November 20, 2007.

The members chosen in this version were: Jose Bordonada Collazo, Chris Moy, Emmanuel Vélez Pagán, Monti Montañez (Che Antonio), and Carlos Olivero. In December, a few weeks after the members of the group were chosen, their &quot;More Than Words&quot; EP was released, including four songs: &quot;More Than Words (A E I O U),&quot; &quot;Mas Que Amor (A E I O U),&quot; &quot;Move,&quot; and &quot;This Christmas.&quot; Their first album was scheduled for release in autumn of 2008.

In 2009 they had a video in two versions titled: &quot;Lost&quot;, in which the American actress, model and singer of Puerto Rican descent, Victoria Justice, appeared, which attracted much attention of the public towards the video. The group disbanded in early 2009.

<text>The Satanic panic is a moral panic consisting of over 12,000 unsubstantiated cases of Satanic ritual abuse (SRA, sometimes known as ritual abuse, ritualistic abuse, organized abuse, or sadistic ritual abuse) starting in the United States in the 1980s, spreading throughout many parts of the world by the late 1990s, and persisting today. The panic originated in 1980 with the publication of &quot;Michelle Remembers&quot;, a book co-written by Canadian psychiatrist Lawrence Pazder and his patient (and future wife), Michelle Smith, which used the controversial and now discredited practice of recovered-memory therapy to make claims about satanic ritual abuse involving Smith. The allegations, which arose afterward throughout much of the United States, involved reports of physical and sexual abuse of people in the context of occult or Satanic rituals. Some allegations involve a conspiracy of a global Satanic cult that includes the wealthy and elite in which children are abducted or bred for human sacrifice, pornography, and prostitution.

Nearly every aspect of the ritual abuse is controversial, including its definition, the source of the allegations and proof thereof, testimonies of alleged victims, and court cases involving the allegations and criminal investigations. The panic affected lawyers, therapists, and social workers who handled allegations of child sexual abuse. Allegations initially brought together widely dissimilar groups, including religious fundamentalists, police investigators, child advocates, therapists, and clients in psychotherapy. The term &quot;satanic abuse&quot; was more common early on; this later became &quot;satanic ritual abuse&quot; and further secularized into simply &quot;ritual abuse&quot;. Over time, the accusations became more closely associated with dissociative identity disorder (then called multiple personality disorder) and anti-government conspiracy theories.

Initial interest arose via the publicity campaign for Pazder&#x27;s 1980 book &quot;Michelle Remembers&quot;, and it was sustained and popularized throughout the decade by coverage of the McMartin preschool trial. Testimonials, symptom lists, rumors, and techniques to investigate or uncover memories of SRA were disseminated through professional, popular, and religious conferences as well as through talk shows, sustaining and further spreading the moral panic throughout the United States and beyond. In some cases, allegations resulted in criminal trials with varying results; after seven years in court, the McMartin trial resulted in no convictions for any of the accused, while other cases resulted in lengthy sentences, some of which were later reversed. Scholarly interest in the topic slowly built, eventually resulting in the conclusion that the phenomenon was a moral panic, which, as one researcher put it in 2017, &quot;involved hundreds of accusations that devil-worshipping paedophiles were operating America&#x27;s white middle-class suburban daycare centers.&quot;

A 1994 article in the &quot;New York Times&quot; stated that: &quot;Of the more than 12,000 documented accusations nationwide, investigating police were not able to substantiate any allegations of organized cult abuse&quot;.

==History==
===Origins===
Among the explanations of why the panic occurred when it did, or &quot;took the shape that it did&quot;, include 
*Three films that opened and ran near the beginning of the panic having to do with Satanism, namely &quot;Rosemary’s Baby&quot; (1968), &quot;The Exorcist&quot; (1973), and &quot;The Omen&quot; (1976). According to scholar Joseph Laycock, patients hypnotized by therapists to recover memories of SRA, often &quot;seemed to be recalling scenes from these films&quot;.
*The reaction against the surge of new religious movements (NRMs) in the 1960s due to both the immigration reform allowing missionaries for Asian religions, as well as new religions, (including the Church of Satan), arising from the counterculture of the baby boomer generation. Sometimes called the &quot;cult wars&quot; or &quot;cult scare&quot;. 
*The Tate–LaBianca murders committed by cult members in the Manson Family which consisted of &quot;mostly lonely teenagers from broken homes&quot;
* Mike Warnke&#x27;s bestselling 1972 memoir &quot;The Satan Seller&quot;, in which he claimed to have led a group of 1,500 Satanists that engaged in rape and human sacrifice before he converted to evangelical Christianity. The book was praised by &quot;Moody Monthly&quot; and &quot;The Christian Century&quot;. Two decades later the book was debunked by an evangelical magazine, &quot;Cornerstone&quot;.

===Early history===
Allegations of horrific acts by outside groups, including cannibalism, child murder, torture, and incestuous orgies can place minorities in the role of the &quot;Other&quot;, as well create a scapegoat for complex problems in times of social disruption. The SRA panic repeated many of the features of historical moral panics and conspiracy theories, such as the blood libel against Jews by Apion in the 30s CE, the wild rumors that led to the persecutions of early Christians in the Roman Empire, later allegations of Jewish rituals involving the cannibalism of Christian babies and desecration of the Eucharist, and the witch hunts of the 16th and 17th centuries. Torture and imprisonment were used by authority figures in order to coerce confessions from alleged Satanists, confessions that were later used to justify their executions. Records of these older allegations were linked by contemporary proponents in an effort to demonstrate that contemporary Satanic cults were part of an ancient conspiracy of evil, though ultimately no evidence of devil-worshiping cults existed in Europe at any time in its history.

A more immediate precedent to the context of Satanic ritual abuse in the United States was McCarthyism in the 1950s. The underpinnings for the contemporary moral panic were found in a rise of five factors in the years leading up to the 1980s: the establishment of fundamentalist Christianity and the founding and political activism of the religious organization which was named the Moral Majority; the rise of the anti-cult movement which accused abusive cults of kidnapping and brainwashing children and teens; the appearance of the Church of Satan and other explicitly Satanist groups which added a kernel of truth to the existence of Satanic cults; the development of the social work or child protection field, and its struggle to have child sexual abuse recognized as a social problem and a serious crime; and the popularization of post-traumatic stress disorder, repressed memory, and the corresponding survivor movement.

===&quot;Michelle Remembers&quot; and the McMartin preschool trial===

&quot;Michelle Remembers&quot;, written by Canadians Michelle Smith and her husband, psychiatrist Lawrence Pazder, was published in 1980. Now discredited, the book was written in the form of an autobiography, presenting the first modern claim that child abuse was linked to Satanic rituals. According to the “memoir”, at the age of five Michelle was tortured by her mother for days in &quot;elaborate satanic rituals&quot;. As the torture reached a climax, a portal to hell opened and Satan himself appeared, only to be driven away by the Virgin Mary and Archangel Michael. Explanations for a lack of any evidence of abuse on Michelle’s body were that it had been miraculously removed by St. Mary. Not explained was testimony from Michelle’s father and two sisters, contradicting the memoir, as well as a 1955/56 St. Margaret’s School yearbook. The yearbook includes a photo taken in November 1955 showing Michelle attending school and appearing healthy, when according to Pazder’s book Michelle spent that month imprisoned in a basement.

Pazder was also responsible for coining the term &quot;ritual abuse&quot;. &quot;Michelle Remembers&quot; provided a model for numerous allegations of SRA that ensued later in the same decade. On the basis of the book&#x27;s success, Pazder developed a high media profile, gave lectures and training on SRA to law enforcement, and by September 1990 had acted as a consultant on more than 1,000 SRA cases, including the McMartin preschool trial. Prosecutors used &quot;Michelle Remembers&quot; as a guide when preparing cases against alleged Satanists. &quot;Michelle Remembers&quot;, along with other accounts portrayed as survivor stories, are suspected to have influenced later allegations of SRA, and the book has been suggested as a causal factor in the later epidemic of SRA allegations.

The early 1980s, during the implementation of mandatory reporting laws, saw a large increase in child protection investigations in America, Britain, and other developed countries, along with a heightened public awareness of child abuse. The investigation of incest allegations in California was also changed, with cases led by social workers who used leading and coercive interviewing techniques that had been avoided by police investigators. Such changes in the prosecution of cases of alleged incest resulted in an increase in confessions by fathers in exchange for plea bargains. Shortly thereafter, some children in child protection cases began making allegations of horrific physical and sexual abuse by caregivers within organized rituals, claiming sexual abuse in Satanic rituals and the use of Satanic symbols. These cases garnered the label &quot;satanic ritual abuse&quot; both in the media and among professionals. Childhood memories of similar abuse began to appear in the psychotherapy sessions of adults.

In 1983, charges were laid in the McMartin preschool trial, a major case in California, which received attention throughout the United States and contained allegations of satanic ritual abuse. The case caused tremendous polarization in how to interpret the available evidence. Shortly afterward, more than 100 preschools across the country became the object of similar sensationalist allegations, which were eagerly and uncritically reported by the press. Throughout the McMartin trial, media coverage of the defendants (Peggy McMartin and Ray Buckey) was unrelentingly negative, focusing only on statements by the prosecution. Michelle Smith and other alleged survivors met with parents involved in the trial, and it is believed that they influenced testimony against the accused.

Kee MacFarlane, a social worker employed by the Children&#x27;s Institute International, developed a new way to interrogate children with anatomically correct dolls and used them in an effort to assist disclosures of abuse with the McMartin children. After asking the children to point to the places on the dolls where they had allegedly been touched and asking leading questions, MacFarlane diagnosed sexual abuse in virtually all the McMartin children. She coerced disclosures by using lengthy interviews that rewarded discussions of abuse and punished denials. The trial testimony that resulted from such methods was often contradictory and vague on all details except for the assertion that the abuse had occurred. Although the initial charges in the McMartin case featured allegations of Satanic abuse and a vast conspiracy, these features were dropped relatively early in the trial, and prosecution continued only for non-ritual allegations of child abuse against only two defendants. After three years of testimony, McMartin and Buckey were acquitted on 52 of 65 counts, and the jury was deadlocked on the remaining 13 charges against Buckey, with 11 of 13 jurors choosing not guilty. Buckey was re-charged and two years later released without conviction.

===Conspiracy theories===
In 1984, MacFarlane warned a congressional committee that children were being forced to engage in scatological behavior and watch bizarre rituals in which animals were being slaughtered. Shortly after, the United States Congress doubled its budget for child-protection programs. Psychiatrist Roland Summit delivered conferences in the wake of the McMartin trial and depicted the phenomenon as a conspiracy that involved anyone skeptical of the phenomenon. By 1986, social worker Carol Darling argued to a grand jury that the conspiracy reached the government. Her husband Brad Darling gave conference presentations about a Satanic conspiracy of great antiquity which he now believed was permeating American communities.

In 1985, Patricia Pulling joined forces with psychiatrist Thomas Radecki, director of the National Coalition on Television Violence, to create B.A.D.D. (Bothered About Dungeons and Dragons). Pulling and B.A.D.D. saw role-playing games generally and Dungeons &amp; Dragons specifically as Satanic cult recruitment tools, inducing youth to suicide, murder, and Satanic ritual abuse. Other alleged recruitment tools included heavy metal music, educators, child care centers, and television. This information was shared at policing and public awareness seminars on crime and the occult, sometimes by active police officers. None of these allegations held up in analysis or in court. In fact, analysis of youth suicide over the period in question found that players of role-playing games actually had a much lower rate of suicide than the average.

Among the conspiracy theories alleged by the panic were that thousands of people a year were being killed by a network of Satanists, what one psychiatrist writing in a psychiatric journal called “a hidden holocaust”.

Explanations for how Satanists covered up this slaughter included their infiltrating media and law enforcement, as well as morticians and crematorium operators to make sure 
no bodies were ever found. Other versions claimed that there were no missing persons because Satanists used certain women as breeders, providing Satanists with thousands of babies for human sacrifices.

By the late 1980s, therapists or patients who believed someone had suffered from SRA could suggest solutions that included Christian psychotherapy, exorcism, and support groups whose members self-identified as &quot;anti-Satanic warriors&quot;. Federal funding was increased for research on child abuse, with large portions of the funding allocated for research on child sexual abuse. Funding was also provided for conferences supporting the idea of SRA, adding a veneer of respectability to the idea as well as offering an opportunity for prosecutors to exchange advice on how to best secure convictions—with tactics including destruction of notes, refusing to tape interviews with children, and destroying or refusing to share evidence with the defense. Had proof been found, SRA would have represented the first occasion where an organized and secret criminal activity had been discovered by mental health professionals. In 1987, Geraldo Rivera produced a national television special on the alleged secret cults, claiming &quot;Estimates are that there are over one million Satanists in [the United States and they are] linked in a highly organized, secretive network.&quot; Tapings of this and similar talk show episodes were subsequently used by religious fundamentalists, psychotherapists, social workers and police to promote the idea that a conspiracy of Satanic cults existed and these cults were committing serious crimes.

In the 1990s, psychologist D. Corydon Hammond publicized a detailed theory of ritual abuse drawn from hypnotherapy sessions with his patients, alleging they were victims of a worldwide conspiracy of organized, secretive clandestine cells who used torture, mind control and ritual abuse to create alternate personalities that could be &quot;activated&quot; with code words; the victims were allegedly trained as assassins, prostitutes, drug traffickers, and child sex workers (to create child pornography). Hammond claimed his patients had revealed the conspiracy was masterminded by a Jewish doctor in Nazi Germany, but who now worked for the Central Intelligence Agency with a goal of worldwide domination by a Satanic cult. The cult was allegedly composed of respectable, powerful members of society who used the funds generated to further their agenda. Missing memories among the victims and absence of evidence was cited as evidence of the power and effectiveness of this cult in furthering its agenda. Hammond&#x27;s claims gained considerable attention, due in part to his prominence in the field of hypnosis and psychotherapy.

===Religious roots and secularization===
Satanic ritual abuse brought together several groups normally unlikely to associate, including psychotherapists, self-help groups, religious fundamentalists and law enforcement. Initial accusations were made in the context of the rising political power of the conservative Christian right within the United States, and religious fundamentalists enthusiastically promoted rumors of SRA. Psychotherapists who were actively Christian advocated for the diagnosis of dissociative identity disorder (DID); soon after, accounts similar to &quot;Michelle Remembers&quot; began to appear, with some therapists believing the alter egos of some patients were the result of demonic possession. Protestantism was instrumental in starting, spreading, and maintaining rumors through sermons about the dangers of SRA, lectures by purported experts, and prayer sessions, including showings of the 1987 Geraldo Rivera television special. Secular proponents appeared, and child protection workers became significantly involved. Law enforcement trainers, many themselves strongly religious, became strong promoters of the claims and self-described &quot;experts&quot; on the topic. Their involvement in child sexual abuse cases produced more allegations of SRA, adding credibility to the phenomenon. As the explanations for SRA were distanced from evangelical Christianity and associated with &quot;survivor&quot; groups, the motivations ascribed to purported Satanists shifted from combating a religious nemesis, to mind control and abuse as an end to itself. Clinicians, psychotherapists and social workers documented clients with alleged histories of SRA, though the claims of therapists were unsubstantiated beyond the testimonies of their clients.

===International spread===
In 1987, a list of &quot;indicators&quot; was published by Catherine Gould, featuring a broad array of vague symptoms that were ultimately common, non-specific and subjective, purported to be capable of diagnosing SRA in most young children. By the late 1980s, allegations began to appear throughout the world (including Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, the Netherlands, and Scandinavia), in part enabled by English as a common international language and in the United Kingdom, assisted by Gould&#x27;s list of indicators. Belief in SRA spread rapidly through the ranks of mental health professionals (despite an absence of evidence) through a variety of continuing education seminars, during which attendees were urged to believe in the reality of Satanic cults, their victims, and not to question the extreme and bizarre memories uncovered. Proof was provided in the form of unconnected bits of information such as pictures drawn by patients, heavy metal album covers, historical folklore about devil worshippers, and pictures of mutilated animals. During the seminars, patients provided testimonials of their experiences and presenters stressed that recovering memories was important for healing:
* In 1986, the largest symposium on child abuse in history was held in Australia, with addresses by vocal SRA advocates Kee MacFarlane, Roland Summit, Astrid Heppenstall Heger, and David Finkelhor.
* In 1987, writings on the phenomenon appeared in the United Kingdom along with incidents featuring broadly similar accusations such as the Cleveland child abuse scandal; allegations of SRA in Nottingham resulted in the &quot;British McMartin&quot;, advised in part by the British journalist Tim Tate&#x27;s work on the subject. Along with the list of indicators, American conference speakers, pamphlets, source materials, consultants, vocabulary regarding SRA and allegedly funding were imported, which promoted the identification and counseling of British SRA allegations. The Nottingham investigation resulted in criminal charges of severe child abuse that ultimately had nothing to do with Satanic rituals, and was criticized for focusing on the irrelevant and non-existent Satanic aspects of the allegations at the expense of the severe conventional abuse endured by the children.
* In 1989, San Francisco Police detective Sandi Gallant gave an interview with a newspaper in the United Kingdom. At the same time, several other therapists toured the country giving talks on SRA, and shortly thereafter SRA cases occurred in Orkney, Rochdale, London, and Nottingham.
* In 1992, charges were laid in the Martensville satanic sex scandal; charges were overturned in 1995 on the grounds of improper interviewing of the children.
* A wave of SRA accusations appeared in New Zealand in 1991, and in Norway in 1992.
* In the mid-nineties in Egypt, tabloids such as Rose Al Youssef started publishing articles about an alleged subculture of Satan worshipping and rituals spreading among the teens and youth of the middle and upper-middle class and associating it with heavy metal music, bands, symbolism, and graffiti. The original article published on 11 November 1996 was written by Abdallah Kamal, but soon other writers and journalists, including Adel Hammuda and others. The public intrigue eventually led to the security apparatus raiding the homes of some young people in the music scene and their friends, confiscating posts and tapes and CDs, forcing short hairstyles on them and subjecting them to religious reformation sessions, before releasing them, but the scare continued to be stirred from time to time until the mid 2000s, and became books and talk shows.
* In 1998, Jean LaFontaine produced a book indicating allegations of SRA in the United Kingdom were sparked by investigations supervised by social workers who had taken SRA seminars in the United States.
* In 2021 and 2022, two consecutive reports by Swiss Television journalists Ilona Stämpfli and presented evidence that conspiracy theories closely related to the Satanic panic were still held by various groups and individuals in Switzerland, among them teachers, psychotherapists, high-ranking police officers, and a senior physician of &quot;Clienia&quot;, the largest private psychiatric clinic group in Switzerland. As a reaction to the first documentary, two of the interviewed teachers as well as the senior physician were let go by their employers.

=== Skepticism, rejection, and contemporary persistence ===

Media coverage of SRA began to turn negative by 1987, and the &quot;panic&quot; ended between 1992 and 1995. The release of the HBO made-for-TV movie &quot;&quot; in 1995 re-cast Ray Buckey as a victim of overzealous prosecution rather than an abusive predator, and marked a watershed change in public perceptions of satanic ritual abuse accusations. In 1995, Geraldo Rivera issued an apology for his 1987 television special which had focused on the alleged cults. In 1996 astrophysicist and astrobiologist Carl Sagan devoted an entire chapter of his final book, &quot;The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark&quot; to a critique of claims of recovered memories of alien abductions and satanic ritual abuse, citing material from the newsletter of the False Memory Syndrome Foundation. By 2003, allegations of ritual abuse were met with great skepticism, and belief in SRA was no longer considered mainstream in professional circles; although the sexual abuse of children was and is a real and serious problem, allegations of SRA were essentially false. Reasons for the collapse of the phenomenon include the failure of criminal prosecutions against alleged abusers, a growing number of scholars, officials and reporters questioning the reality of the accusations, and a variety of successful lawsuits against mental health professionals.

Some feminist critics of the SRA diagnoses maintained that, in the course of attempting to purge society of evil, the panic of the 1980s and 1990s obscured actual child-abuse issues, a concern echoed by author Gary Clapton. In England, the SRA panic diverted resources and attention away from proven abuse cases; this resulted in a &quot;hierarchy&quot; of abuse in which SRA was the most serious form, physical and sexual abuse being minimized and/or marginalized, and &quot;mere&quot; physical abuse no longer worthy of intervention. As criticism of SRA investigations increased, the focus by social workers on SRA resulted in a large loss of credibility to the profession. SRA, with its sensational narrative of many victims abused by many victimizers, ended up robbing the far-more-common and proven issue of incest against children of much of its societal significance. The National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect devised the term &quot;religious abuse&quot; to describe exorcism, poisoning, and drowning of children in non-satanic religious settings in order to avoid confusion with SRA.

Some groups still believe there is credence to allegations of SRA and continue to discuss the topic. Publications by Cathy O&#x27;Brien claiming SRA was the result of government programs (specifically the Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s Project MKULTRA) to produce Manchurian candidate-style mind control in young children were picked up by conspiracy theorists, linking belief in SRA with claims of government conspiracies. In the 2007 book &quot;Mistakes Were Made (but Not by Me)&quot;, authors Carol Tavris and Elliot Aronson cite an ongoing belief in the SRA phenomenon, despite a complete lack of evidence, as demonstration of confirmation bias in believers; it further points out that a lack of evidence is actually considered by believers in SRA as &quot;additional&quot; evidence, demonstrating &quot;how clever and evil the cult leaders were: They were eating those babies, bones and all.&quot; A Salt Lake City therapist, Barbara Snow, was put on probation in 2008 for planting false memories of satanic abuse in patients. One notable client of hers was Teal Swan. The International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation (ISSTD), a professional nonprofit organization, is known for its advocacy of contemporary narratives surrounding alleged satanic conspiracies. Historically, the organization has convened annual conference presentations dedicated to the exploration and discussion of these topics.

The far-right conspiracy theory movement known as QAnon, which originated on 4chan in 2017, has adopted many of the tropes of SRA and Satanic Panic. Instead of daycare centers being the center of abuse, however, liberal Hollywood actors, Democratic politicians, and high-ranking government officials are portrayed as a child-abusing cabal of Satanists.

==Definitions==
The term &quot;satanic ritual abuse&quot; is used to describe different behaviors, actions and allegations that lie between extremes of definitions. In 1988, a nationwide study of sexual abuse in US day care agencies, led by David Finkelhor, divided &quot;ritual abuse&quot; allegations into three categories—cult-based ritualism in which the abuse had a spiritual or social goal for the perpetrators, pseudo-ritualism in which the goal was sexual gratification and the rituals were used to frighten or intimidate victims, and psychopathological ritualism in which the rituals were due to mental disorders. Subsequent investigators have expanded on these definitions and also pointed to a fourth alleged type of Satanic ritual abuse, in which petty crimes with ambiguous meaning (such as graffiti or vandalism) generally committed by teenagers were attributed to the actions of Satanic cults.

By the early 1990s, the phrase &quot;Satanic ritual abuse&quot; was featured in media coverage of ritualistic abuse but its use decreased among professionals in favor of more nuanced terms such as multi-dimensional child sex rings, ritual/ritualistic abuse, organized abuse or sadistic abuse, some of which acknowledged the complexity of abuse cases with multiple perpetrators and victims without projecting a religious framework onto perpetrators. The latter in particular failed to substantively improve on or replace &quot;Satanic&quot; abuse as it was never used to describe any rituals except the Satanic ones that were the core of SRA allegations. Abuse within the context of Christianity, Islam, or any other religions failed to enter the SRA discourse.

===Cult-based abuse===
Allegation of cult-based abuse is the most extreme scenario of SRA. During the initial period of interest starting in the early 1980s the term was used to describe a network of Satan-worshipping, secretive intergenerational cults that were supposedly part of a highly organized conspiracy engaged in criminal behaviors such as forced prostitution, drug distribution and pornography. These cults were also thought to sexually abuse and torture children in order to coerce them into a lifetime of Devil worship. Other allegations included bizarre sexual acts such as necrophilia, forced ingestion of semen, blood and feces, cannibalism, orgies, liturgical parody such as pseudosacramental use of feces and urine; infanticide, sacrificial abortions to eat fetuses and human sacrifice; satanic police officers who covered up evidence of SRA crimes and desecration of Christian graves. No evidence of any of these claims has ever been found; the proof presented by those who alleged the reality of cult-based abuse primarily consisted of the memories of adults recalling childhood abuse, the testimony of young children and extremely controversial confessions. The idea of a murderous Satanic conspiracy created a controversy dividing the professional child abuse community at the time, though no evidence has been found to support allegations of a large number of children being killed or abused in Satanic rituals. From a law enforcement perspective, an intergenerational conspiracy dedicated to ritual sacrifice whose members remain completely silent, make no mistakes and leave no physical evidence is unlikely; cases of what the media incorrectly perceived as actual cult sacrifices (such as the 1989 case of Adolfo Constanzo) have supported this idea.

===Criminal and delusional satanism===
A third variation of ritual abuse involves non-religious ritual abuse in which the rituals were delusional or obsessive. There are incidents of extreme sadistic crimes that are committed by individuals, loosely organized families and possibly in some organized cults, some of which may be connected to Satanism, though this is more likely to be related to sex trafficking; though SRA may happen in families, extended families and localized groups, it is not believed to occur in large, organized groups.

===Acting out===
Investigators considered graffiti such as the pentagram to be evidence of a Satanic cult. Ambiguous crimes in which actual or erroneously believed symbols of Satanism appear have also been claimed as part of the SRA phenomenon, though in most cases the crimes cannot be linked to a specific belief system; minor crimes such as vandalism, trespassing and graffiti were often found to be the actions of teenagers who were acting out.

===Polarization===

There was never any consensus on what actually constituted Satanic ritual abuse. This lack of a single definition, as well as confusion between the meanings of the term &quot;ritual&quot; (religious versus psychological) allowed a wide range of allegations and evidence to be claimed as a demonstration of the reality of SRA allegations, irrespective of which &quot;definition&quot; the evidence supported. Acrimonious disagreements between groups who supported SRA allegations as authentic and those criticizing them as unsubstantiated resulted in an extremely polarized discussion with little middle ground. The lack of credible evidence for the more extreme interpretations often being seen as evidence of an effective conspiracy rather than an indication that the allegations are unfounded. The religious beliefs or atheism of the disputants have also resulted in different interpretations of evidence, and as well as accusations of those who reject the claims being &quot;anti-child&quot;. Both believers and skeptics have developed networks to disseminate information on their respective positions. One of the central themes of the discussion among English child abuse professionals was the assertion that people should simply &quot;believe the children&quot;, and that the testimony of children was sufficient proof, which ignored the fact that in many cases the testimony of children was interpreted by professionals rather than the children explicitly disclosing allegations of abuse. In some cases this was simultaneously presented with the idea that it did not matter if SRA actually existed, that the empirical truth of SRA was irrelevant, that the testimony of children was more important than that of doctors, social workers and the criminal justice system.

==Evidence==
The National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect conducted a study led by University of California psychologist Gail Goodman, which found that among 12,000 accusations of ritual or religious-linked abuse, there was no evidence for &quot;a well-organized intergenerational satanic cult, who sexually molested and tortured children,&quot; although there was &quot;convincing evidence of lone perpetrators or couples who say they are involved with Satan or use the claim to intimidate victims.&quot; One such case Goodman studied involved &quot;grandparents [who] had black robes, candles, and Christ on an inverted crucifix—and the children had chlamydia, a sexually transmitted disease, in their throats,&quot; according to the report by a district attorney.

The evidence for SRA was primarily in the form of testimonies from children who made allegations of SRA, and adults who claim to remember abuse during childhood, that may have been forgotten and recovered during therapy.

With both children and adults, no corroborating evidence has been found for anything except pseudosatanism in which the satanic and ritual aspects were secondary to and used as a cover for sexual abuse. Despite this lack of objective evidence, and aided by the competing definitions of what SRA actually was, proponents claimed SRA was a real phenomenon throughout the peak and during the decline of the moral panic. Despite allegations appearing in the United States, Netherlands, Sweden, New Zealand and Australia, no material evidence has been found to corroborate allegations of organized cult-based abuse that practices human sacrifice and cannibalism. Though trauma specialists frequently claimed the allegations made by children and adults were the same, in reality the statements made by adults were more elaborate, severe, and featured more bizarre abuse. In 95 percent of the adults&#x27; cases, the memories of the abuse were recovered during psychotherapy.

For several years, a conviction list assembled by the Believe the Children advocacy group was circulated as proof of the truth of satanic ritual abuse allegations, though the organization itself no longer exists and the list itself is &quot;egregiously out of date&quot;.

===Investigations===
Two investigations were carried out to assess the evidence for SRA. In the United Kingdom, a government report produced no evidence of SRA, but several examples of false satanists faking rituals to frighten their victims. In the United States, evidence was reported but was based on a flawed method with an overly liberal definition of a substantiated case.

====United Kingdom====
A British study published in 1996 found 62 cases of alleged ritual abuse reported to researchers by police, social and welfare agencies from the period of 1988 to 1991, representing a tiny proportion of extremely high-profile cases compared to the total number investigated by the agencies. Anthropologist Jean La Fontaine spent several years researching ritual abuse cases in Britain at the behest of the government, finding that all of the cases of alleged satanic ritual abuse that could be substantiated were cases where the perpetrators&#x27; goal was sexual gratification rather than religious worship. Producing several reports and the 1998 book &quot;Speak of the Devil&quot;, after reviewing cases reported to police and children&#x27;s protective services throughout the country, LaFontaine concluded that the only rituals she uncovered were those invented by child abusers to frighten their victims or justify the sexual abuse. In addition, the sexual abuse occurred outside of the rituals, indicating the goal of the abuser was sexual gratification rather than ritualistic or religious. In cases involving satanic abuse, the satanic allegations by younger children were influenced by adults, and the concerns over the satanic aspects were found to be compelling due to cultural attraction of the concept but distracting from the actual harm caused to the abuse victims.

In more recent years, discredited allegations of SRA have been levelled against Jimmy Savile during the posthumous investigation into his sexual abuse of children, as well as against former Prime Minister Ted Heath (who was previously falsely accused of SRA during his lifetime).

====United States====

David Finkelhor completed an investigation of child sexual abuse in daycares in the United States and published a report in 1988. The report found 270 cases of sexual abuse, of which 36 were classified as substantiated cases of ritual abuse. Mary de Young has pointed out that the report&#x27;s definition of &quot;substantiated&quot; was overly liberal as it required only that one agency had decided that abuse had occurred, even if no action was taken, no arrests made, no operating licenses suspended. In addition, multiple agencies may have been involved in each case (including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, local police, social services agencies and childhood protective services in many cases), with wide differences in suspicion and confirmation, often in disagreement with each other. Finkelhor, upon receiving a &quot;confirmation&quot;, would collect information from whoever was willing or interested to provide it and did not independently investigate the cases, resulting in frequent errors in his conclusions. No data is provided beyond case studies and brief summaries. Three other cases considered corroborating by the public—the McMartin preschool trial, the Country Walk case and the murders in Matamoros, by Adolfo Constanzo—ultimately failed to support the existence of SRA. The primary witness in the Country Walk case repeatedly made, then withdrew accusations against her husband amid unusual and coercive inquiries by her lawyer and a psychologist. The Matamoros murders produced the bodies of 12 adults who were ritually sacrificed by a drug gang inspired by the film &quot;The Believers&quot;, but did not involve children or sexual abuse. The McMartin case resulted in no convictions and was ultimately based on accusations by children with no proof beyond their coerced testimonies. A 1990/1991 survey of clinicians, which reviewed 386 allegations of ritual and 191 allegations of religious abuse, described 10% and under 3% of those allegations, respectively, as unfounded following social service investigation.

====The Netherlands====
Dutch investigative journalists from &quot;Argos&quot; (NPO Radio 1) collected the experiences and stories of over two hundred victims of organized sexual abuse. A hundred and forty victims told Argos about ritual abuse. Six well-known people were mentioned as perpetrators by multiple participants in the investigation, and over ten abuse locations. A warehouse in the Bollenstreek was marked as a location for &#x27;storage&#x27; and the production of child pornography. During the investigation the &quot;Argos&quot; journalists received an anonymous email stating the journalists had to &#x27;beaware&#x27; because &quot;they know about your investigation&quot;, remarking &quot;they&#x27;re going to get rid of evidence just like they did with Dutroux&quot;. The same day as the journalists received the e-mail, the warehouse in the Bollenstreek burnt down. According to Argos, the damage had been classified so severe by the fire department, that a cause of fire could not be determined.

As a response to parliamentary questions following the &quot;Argos&quot; investigation, Dutch Minister of Justice and Security Ferdinand Grapperhaus said on August 27, 2020, that there would be &#x27;no independent investigation into Ritual Abuse&#x27; of children in The Netherlands. The Green Left, the Socialist Party and the Labour Party criticized Grapperhaus for his decision. On October 13, 2020, the Dutch House of Representatives approved a motion in which the PvdA, GL and the SP requested that an independent investigation be conducted into the nature and extent of &quot;organized sadistic abuse of children&quot;, bypassing Grapperhaus&#x27; original refusal to investigate.

In a &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; article JD Sword discusses the outcomes of a subsequent commission appointed by Grapperhaus and led by Jan Hendriks, professor of criminology from the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam and associate professor Anne-Marie Slotboom. In December 2022 Hendriks returned a report which found there is no evidence of organized abuse with ritualistic features and “Overall, victims are the only primary source reporting this type of abuse and no support for its existence is found from other sources.”

===Patients&#x27; allegations===
The majority of adult testimonials were given by adults while they were undergoing psychotherapy, in most cases they were undergoing therapy which was designed to elicit memories of SRA. Therapists claimed that the pain which their patients felt, the internal consistency of their stories and the similarities of the allegations which were made by different patients all proved the existence of SRA, but despite this, the disclosures of patients never resulted in any corroboration; The allegations which were obtained from the alleged victims by mental health practitioners all lacked verifiable evidence, they were entirely anecdotal and they all involved incidents which occurred years or decades earlier. The concern for therapists revolved around the pain of their clients, which is for them more important than the truth of their patients&#x27; statements. A sample of 29 patients in a medical clinic reporting SRA found no corroboration of the claims in medical records or in discussion with family members. and a survey of 2,709 American therapists found the majority of allegations of SRA came from only sixteen therapists, suggesting that the determining factor in a patient making allegations of SRA was the therapist&#x27;s predisposition. Further, the alleged similarities between patient accounts (particularly between adults and children) turned out to be illusory upon review, with adults describing far more elaborate, severe and bizarre abuse than children. Bette Bottoms, who reviewed hundreds of claims of adult and child abuse, described the ultimate evidence for the abuse as &quot;astonishingly weak and ambiguous&quot; particularly given the severity of the alleged abuse. Therapists however, were found to believe patients more as the allegations became more bizarre and severe.

In cases in which patients made claims that were physically impossible, or in cases in which the evidence which was found by police is contradictory, the details which are reported will often change. If patients pointed to a spot where a body was buried, but no body was found and no earth was disturbed, therapists resort to special pleading, saying that the patient was hypnotically programmed to direct investigators to the wrong location, or the patient was fooled by the cult into believing that a crime was not committed. If the alleged bodies were cremated and police point out that ordinary fires are inadequate to completely destroy a body, stories include special industrial furnaces. The patients&#x27; allegations change, and they creatively find &quot;solutions&quot; to objections.

===Children&#x27;s allegations===
The second group to make allegations of SRA were young children. During the &quot;Satanic Panic&quot; of the 1980s, the techniques used by investigators to gather evidence from witnesses, particularly young children, evolved to become very leading, coercive and suggestive, pressuring young children to provide testimony and refusing to accept denials while offering inducements that encouraged false disclosures. The interviewing techniques used were the factors believed to have led to the construction of the bizarre disclosures of SRA by the children and changes to forensic and interviewing techniques since that time has resulted in a disappearance of the allegations. Analysis of the techniques used in two key cases (the McMartin Preschool and Wee Care Nursery School trials) concluded that the children were questioned in a highly suggestive manner. Compared with a set of interviews from Child Protective Services, the interviews from the two trials were &quot;significantly more likely to (a) introduce new suggestive information into the interview, (b) provide praise, promises, and positive reinforcement, (c) express disapproval, disbelief, or disagreement with children, (d) exert conformity pressure, and (e) invite children to pretend or speculate about supposed events.&quot;

Specific allegations from the cases included:
* Seeing witches fly; travel in a hot air balloon; abuse and travel through tunnels; identifying actor Chuck Norris from a series of pictures as an abuser; orgies at car washes and airports, children being flushed down toilets to secret rooms where they would be abused, then cleaned up and presented back to their unsuspecting parents (McMartin preschool trial, no forensic evidence was found to support these claims)
* Being raped with knives (including a 12-inch blade), sticks, forks, and magic wands; assault by a clown in a magic room; being forced to drink urine; tied naked to a tree (Fells Acres day care sexual abuse trial; no forensic evidence was found to support these claims)
* Ritual murder of babies; children taken out on boats and thrown overboard; trips in hot air balloons; babies were thrown against walls; children were penetrated with knives and forks; the walls and floors of the center&#x27;s music room were spread with urine and feces (Little Rascals day care sexual abuse trial; no forensic evidence was found to support these claims)
* Forced to act in child pornography and used for child prostitution; tortured; made to watch snuff films (Kern County child abuse cases; no child pornography was ever found to substantiate these accusations)
* The mentally disabled abuser with Noonan syndrome drank human blood in satanic rituals; abducted the children despite being unable to drive; forced the children to eat urine and feces; abducted the children to secret rooms; committed violent sexual assaults and beatings; killed a giraffe, rabbit and elephant and drank their blood in front of the children. (Faith Chapel Church ritual abuse case; no forensic evidence was found to support these claims)

A variety of these allegations resulted in criminal convictions; in an analysis of these cases Mary de Young found that many had had their convictions overturned. Of 22 daycare employees and their sentences reviewed in 2007, three were still incarcerated, eleven had charges dismissed or overturned, and eight were released before serving their full sentences. Grounds included technical dismissals, constitutional challenges and prosecutorial misconduct.

==Skepticism==

===As a moral panic===
SRA and the so-called &quot;Satanic Panic&quot; have been called a moral panic and compared to the blood libel and witch-hunts of historical Europe, and McCarthyism in the United States during the 20th century. Stanley Cohen, who originated the term &quot;moral panic&quot;, called the episode &quot;one of the purest cases of moral panic&quot;. The initial investigations of SRA were performed by anthropologists and sociologists, who failed to find evidence of SRA actually occurring; instead they concluded that SRA was a result of rumors and folk legends that were spread by &quot;media hype, Christian fundamentalism, mental health and law enforcement professionals and child abuse advocates.&quot; Sociologists and journalists noted the vigorous nature with which some evangelical activists and groups were using claims of SRA to further their religious and political goals. Other commentators suggested that the entire phenomenon may be evidence of a moral panic over Satanism and child abuse. After skeptical inquiry, explanations for allegations of SRA have included an attempt by radical feminists to undermine the nuclear family, a backlash against working women, homophobic attacks on gay childcare workers, a universal need to believe in evil, fear of alternative spiritualities, &quot;end of the millennium&quot; anxieties, or a transient form of temporal lobe epilepsy.

In his book &quot;Satanic Panic&quot;, the 1994 Mencken Award winner for Best Book presented by the Free Press Association, Jeffery Victor wrote that, in the United States, the groups most likely to believe rumors of SRA are rural, poorly educated, religiously conservative white blue-collar families with an unquestioning belief in American values who feel significant anxieties over job loss, economic decline and family disintegration. Victor considered rumors of SRA a symptom of a moral crisis and a form of scapegoating for economic and social ills.

===Origins of the rumors===
Information about SRA claims spread through conferences presented to religious groups, churches and professionals such as police forces and therapists as well as parents. These conferences and presentations served to organize agencies and foster communication between groups, maintaining and spreading disproven or exaggerated stories as fact. Members of local police forces organized into loose networks focused on cult crimes, some of whom billed themselves as &quot;experts&quot; and were paid to speak at conferences throughout the United States. Religious revivalists also took advantage of the rumors and preached about the dangers of Satanism to youth and presented themselves at paid engagements as secular experts. At the height of the panic, the highly emotional accusations and circumstances of SRA allegations made it difficult to investigate the claims, with the accused being assumed as guilty and skeptics becoming co-accused during trials, and trials moving forward based solely on the testimony of very young children without corroborating evidence. No forensic or corroborating evidence has ever been found for religiously based cannibalistic or murderous SRA, despite extensive investigations. The concern and reaction expressed by various groups regarding the seriousness or threat of SRA has been considered out-of-proportion to the actual threat by satanically-motivated crimes, and the rare crime that exists that may be labeled &quot;satanic&quot; does not equate to the existence of a conspiracy or network of religiously-motivated child abusers.

===Scholarly and law enforcement investigations===
Jeffrey Victor reviewed 67 rumors about SRA in the United States and Canada reported in newspapers or television and found no evidence supporting the existence of murderous satanic cults. LaFontaine states that cases of alleged SRA investigated in the United Kingdom were reviewed in detail and the majority were unsubstantiated; three were found to involve sexual abuse of children in the context of rituals, but none involved the Witches&#x27; Sabbath or devil worship that are characteristic of allegations of SRA. LaFontaine also states that no material evidence has been forthcoming in allegations of SRA; no bones, bodies or blood, in either the United States or Britain.

Kenneth Lanning, an FBI expert in the investigation of child sexual abuse, has stated that pseudo-Satanism may exist but there is &quot;little or no evidence for ... large-scale baby breeding, human sacrifice, and organized satanic conspiracies.&quot;: There are many possible alternative answers to the question of why victims are alleging things that don&#x27;t seem to be true. ... I believe that there is a middle ground—a continuum of possible activity. Some of what the victims allege may be true and accurate, some may be misperceived or distorted, some may be screened or symbolic, and some may be &quot;contaminated&quot; or false. The problem and challenge, especially for law enforcement, is to determine which is which. This can only be done through active investigation. I believe that the majority of victims alleging &quot;ritual&quot; abuse are in fact victims of some form of abuse or trauma.

Lanning produced a monograph in 1994 on SRA aimed at child protection authorities, which contained his opinion that despite hundreds of investigations no corroboration of SRA had been found. Following this report, several convictions based on SRA allegations were overturned and the defendants released.

Reported cases of SRA involve bizarre activities, some of which are impossible (like people flying), that makes the credibility of victims of child sexual abuse questionable. In cases where SRA is alleged to occur, Lanning describes common dynamics of the use of fear to control multiple young victims, the presence of multiple perpetrators and strange or ritualized behaviors, though allegations of crimes such as human sacrifice and cannibalism do not seem to be true. Lanning also suggests several reasons why adult victims may make allegations of SRA, including &quot;pathological distortion, traumatic memory, normal childhood fears and fantasies, misperception, and confusion.&quot;

==Court cases==

Allegations of SRA have appeared throughout the world. In 1984, a large scale investigation and prosecution of ritual abuse in Jordan, Minnesota drew national attention for poor investigative and prosecutorial practices. A group of parents named Victims of Child Abuse Laws grew and gained political power. The testimony of children in these cases may have led to their collapse, as juries came to believe that the sources of the allegations were the use of suggestive and manipulative interviewing techniques, rather than actual events. Research since that time has supported these concerns and without the use of these techniques it is unlikely the cases would ever have reached trial.

In one analysis of 36 court cases involving sexual abuse of children within rituals, only one quarter resulted in convictions, all of which had little to do with ritual sex abuse. In a survey of more than 11,000 psychiatric and police workers throughout the US, conducted for the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect, researchers investigated approximately 12,000 accusations of ritual or religious abuse between 1980 and 1990. The survey found no substantiated reports of well-organized satanic rings of people who sexually abuse children, but did find incidents in which the ritualistic aspects were secondary to the abuse and were used to intimidate victims. Victor reviewed 21 court cases alleging SRA between 1983 and 1987 in which no prosecutions were obtained for ritual abuse.

During the early 1980s, some courts attempted &quot;ad hoc&quot; accommodations to address the anxieties of child witnesses in relation to testifying before defendants. Screens or CCTV technology are a common feature of child sexual assault trials today; children in the early 1980s were typically forced into direct visual contact with the accused abuser while in court. SRA allegations in the courts catalyzed a broad agenda of research into the nature of children&#x27;s testimony and the reliability of their oral evidence in court. Ultimately in SRA cases, the coercive techniques used by believing district attorneys, therapists and police officers were critical in establishing, and often resolving, SRA cases. In courts, when juries were able to see recordings or transcripts of interviews with children, the alleged abusers were acquitted. The reaction by successful prosecutors, spread throughout conventions and conferences on SRA, was to destroy, or fail to take notes of the interviews in the first place. One group of researchers concluded that children usually lack the sufficient amount of &quot;explicit knowledge&quot; of satanic ritual abuse to fabricate all of the details of an SRA claim on their own. However, the same researchers also concluded that children usually have the sufficient amount of general knowledge of &quot;violence and the occult&quot; to &quot;serve as a starting point from which ritual claims could develop.&quot;

In 2006, psychologist and attorney Christopher Barden drafted an &quot;amicus curiae&quot; brief to the Supreme Court of California signed by nearly 100 international experts in the field of human memory emphasizing the lack of credible scientific support for repressed and recovered memories.

==Dissociative identity disorder==
SRA has been linked to dissociative identity disorder (DID, formerly known as multiple personality disorder or MPD), with some DID patients also alleging cult abuse. The first person to write a first-person narrative about SRA was Michelle Smith, co-author of &quot;Michelle Remembers&quot;; Smith was diagnosed with DID by her therapist and later husband Lawrence Pazder. Psychiatrists involved with the International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation (ISSTD, then called the International Society for the Study of Multiple Personality and Dissociation), especially associate editor Bennett G. Braun, uncritically promoted the idea that actual groups of persons who worshiped Satan were abusing and ritually sacrificing children and, furthermore, that thousands of persons were recovering actual memories of such abuse during therapy, openly discussing such claims in the organization&#x27;s journal, &quot;Dissociation&quot;. In a 1989 editorial, &quot;Dissociation&quot; editor-in-chief Richard Kluft likened clinicians who did not speak of their patients with recovered memories of SRA to the &quot;good Germans&quot; during the Holocaust. One particularly controversial article found parallels between SRA accounts and pre-Inquisition historical records of satanism, hence claimed to find support for the existence of ancient and intergenerational satanic cults. A review of these claims by sociologist Mary de Young in a 1994 &quot;Behavioral Sciences and the Law&quot; article noted that the historical basis for these claims, and in particular their continuity of cults, ceremonies and rituals was questionable. However at an ISSTD conference in November 1990, psychiatrist and researcher Frank Putnam, then chief of the Dissociative Disorders Unit of the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Maryland, led a plenary session panel that proved to be the first public presentation of psychiatric, historical and law enforcement skepticism concerning SRA claims. Other members of the panel included psychiatrist George Ganaway, anthropologist Sherrill Mulhern, and psychologist Richard Noll. Putnam, a skeptic, was viewed by SRA advocates in attendance as using fellow skeptics such as Noll and Mulhern as allies in a disinformation campaign to split the SRA-believing community.

A survey of 12,000 cases of alleged ritual or religious abuse found that most were diagnosed with DID as well as post-traumatic stress disorder. The level of dissociation in a sample of women alleging SRA was found to be higher than a comparable sample of non-SRA peers, approaching the levels shown by patients diagnosed with DID. A sample of patients diagnosed with DID and reporting childhood SRA also present other symptoms including &quot;dissociative states with satanic overtones, severe post-traumatic stress disorder, survivor guilt, bizarre self abuse, unusual fears, sexualization of sadistic impulses, indoctrinated beliefs, and substance abuse.&quot; Commenting on the study, Philip Coons stated that patients were held together in a ward dedicated to dissociative disorders with ample opportunity to socialize, and that the memories were recovered through the use of hypnosis (which he considered questionable). No cases were referred to law enforcement for verification, nor was verification attempted through family members. Coons also pointed out that existing injuries could have been self-inflicted, that the experiences reported were &quot;strikingly similar&quot; and that &quot;many of the SRA reports developed while patients were hospitalized.&quot; The reliability of memories of DID clients who alleged SRA in treatment has been questioned and a point of contention in the popular media and with clinicians; many of the allegations made are fundamentally impossible and alleged survivors lack the physical scars that would result were their allegations true.

Many women claiming to be SRA survivors have been diagnosed with DID, and it is unclear if their claims of childhood abuse are accurate or a manifestation of their diagnosis. Of a sample of 29 patients who presented with SRA, 22 were diagnosed with dissociative disorders including DID. The authors noted that 58 percent of the SRA claims appeared in the years following the Geraldo Rivera special on SRA and a further 34 percent following a workshop on SRA presented in the area; in only two patients were the memories elicited without the use of &quot;questionable therapeutic practices for memory retrieval&quot;. Claims of SRA by DID patients have been called &quot;...often nothing more than fantastic pseudomemories implanted or reinforced in psychotherapy&quot; and SRA a cultural script of the perception of DID. Some believe that memories of SRA are solely iatrogenically implanted memories from suggestive therapeutic techniques, though this has been criticized by Daniel Brown, Alan Scheflin and Corydon Hammond for what they argue as over-reaching the scientific data that supports an iatrogenic theory. Others have criticized Hammond specifically for using therapeutic techniques to gather information from clients that rely solely on information fed by the therapist in a manner that highly suggests iatrogenesis. Skeptics said that the increase in DID diagnosis in the 1980s and 1990s and its association with memories of SRA is evidence of malpractice by treating professionals.

Much of the body of literature on the treatment of ritually abused patients focuses on dissociative disorders.

== False memories ==
One explanation for the SRA allegations is that they were based upon false memories caused by use of discredited suggestive techniques such as hypnosis and leading questions by therapists underestimating the suggestibility of their clients. The altered state of consciousness induced by hypnosis rendered patients an unusual ability to produce confabulations, often with the assistance of their therapists.

Paul R. McHugh, professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University, discusses in his book &quot;Try to Remember&quot; the developments that led to the creation of false memories in the SRA moral panic and the formation of the FMSF as an effort to bring contemporary scientific research and political action to the polarizing struggle about false memories within the mental health disciplines. According to McHugh, there is no coherent scientific basis for the core belief of one side of the struggle, that sexual abuse can cause massive systemic repression of memories that can only be accessed through hypnosis, coercive interviews and other dubious techniques. The group of psychiatrists who promoted these ideas, whom McHugh terms &quot;Mannerist Freudians&quot;, consistently followed a deductive approach to diagnosis in which the theory and causal explanation of symptoms was assumed to be childhood sexual abuse leading to dissociation, followed by a set of unproven and unreliable treatments with a strong confirmation bias that inevitably produced the allegations and causes that were assumed to be there.

The treatment approach involved isolation of the patient from friends and family within psychiatric wards dedicated to the treatment of dissociation, filled with other patients who were treated by the same doctors with the same flawed methods and staff members who also coherently and universally ascribed to the same set of beliefs. These methods began in the 1980s and continued for several years until a series of court cases and medical malpractice lawsuits resulted in hospitals failing to support the approach. In cases where the dissociative symptoms were ignored, the coercive treatment approach ceased and the patients were removed from dedicated wards, allegations of satanic rape and abuse normally ceased, &quot;recovered&quot; memories were identified as fabrications and conventional treatments for presenting symptoms were generally successful.

<doc id="80404" wikidata="Q463157" url="?curid=80404" title="America West Airlines">
<text>America West Airlines was an airline in the United States that operated from 1981 until it merged with US Airways in 2007. It was headquartered in Tempe, Arizona. Its main hub was at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, with secondary hubs at McCarren International Airport in Las Vegas, Nevada and Port Columbus International Airport in Columbus, Ohio. The airline merged with US Airways in 2005 and adopted US Airways as their brand name. America West served about 100 cities in the US, Canada, and Mexico; flights to Europe were on codeshare partners. In September 2005, the airline had 140 aircraft, with a single maintenance base at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. Regional jet and turboprop flights were operated on a code sharing basis by Mesa Airlines and Chautauqua Airlines as America West Express.

Beginning in January 2006, all America West flights were branded as US Airways, along with most signage at airports and other printed material, though many flights were described as &quot;operated by America West.&quot; Apart from two heritage aircraft, the only remaining America West branding on aircraft were found on some seat covers and bulkheads. The merged airline used America West&#x27;s &quot;CACTUS&quot; callsign and ICAO code &quot;AWE&quot;, but retained the US Airways name. As part of a merger between American Airlines and US Airways in February 2013, which led to American becoming the world&#x27;s largest airline, the call sign and ICAO code name was later retired on April 8, 2015, when the FAA granted a single operating certificate for both US Airways and American Airlines. The US Airways brand continued until October 17, 2015, when it merged with American Airlines.

==History==

The airline was established in February 1981 and began operations August 1, 1983, using three leased Boeing 737s flying out of its base in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), with Ed Beauvais, a well-known airline industry consultant, as CEO. In the early years, passengers could purchase their tickets on the aircraft.

The airline quickly expanded, with 11 737s flying to 13 cities; in 1984, America West&#x27;s fleet grew to 21 aircraft flying to 23 cities. The June 1984 timetable shows 71 weekday departures from Phoenix, non-stop to 18 cities; from 1985 to 1986, it established a second hub at Las Vegas.

Confident in its expansion, the increasingly-dominant carrier at Phoenix Sky Harbor influenced the development of Terminal 4. America West requested that the construction include an auxiliary power facility and an underground cavity to accommodate a future rail station, to which the airport ultimately agreed.

America West was one of the first airlines to use extensive &quot;cross-utilization&quot;, in which employees were trained in a variety of airline jobs, such as pilots trained in dispatch, and both baggage handlers and flight attendants trained as gate agents. America West started as a &quot;full-service&quot; airline, in contrast with Southwest Airlines, a discount air carrier competing in many markets. America West used an aggressive employee stock-ownership program, in which new employees were required to invest 20% of their salary in company stock, providing a steady flow of cash as the company grew. America West pilots and other employees were paid wages far below those of competitors
By 1985 America West had outgrown their gate space at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and during the construction of Terminal 4, approved in 1986, a temporary concourse was added to the southwest corner of Terminal 3 to give them six more gates (growing to eleven by 1990).

The airline&#x27;s growth continued in 1986 and the airline expanded its fleet, mainly with Boeing 757-200s purchased from Northwest Airlines (following Northwest&#x27;s acquisition of Republic Airlines) and a number of de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8s. (Unusually, the Dash 8 flights were not code-shares and Mesa code-shares replaced them in 1992–93.) The airline started red-eye flights from Las Vegas to improve aircraft utilization.


America West&#x27;s rapid growth led to large losses and by 1986 the company was on the verge of bankruptcy. Originally slated to occupy the vast majority of the gates in Terminal 4, the airline had to reduce their commitment to the city of Phoenix to just 28 gates, with the growing Southwest Airlines agreeing to lease the remainder of Terminal 4.

In June 1987 Ansett Transport Industries purchased a 20% stake in America West, increasing it to 26% in April 1991.

In 1988, Patrick Thurston, Vice-President of Operations, Bob Russell, Chief of Pilots, and Carl Wobser, a captain, all pleaded guilty to multiple counts of narcotics trafficking.

Three America West Airlines aircraft operated services in Australia with Ansett Australia during the 1989 Australian pilots&#x27; dispute.
As they explored destinations beyond the United States, America West filed with Department of Transportation for a Phoenix to Sydney route to connect with Ansett Airlines in Australia. The proposal was rejected and the Reagan Administration awarded the route to another airline. In 1989, America West leased four Boeing 747-200s (formerly operated by KLM) and began non-stop 747 flights between Phoenix and Honolulu, Hawaii, and non-stop between Honolulu and Nagoya, Japan. The 747 was the only wide-body aircraft America West used for long-haul flights. The airline also expanded narrow-body jet service to Mexican destinations.

In 1990, America West moved into the new Terminal 4 at Phoenix and took delivery of several Airbus A320s originally destined for now-defunct Braniff Airways. Braniff had purchased the order rights from Pan Am, another troubled carrier, and the A320s were sold to America West at a steep discount. Annual revenue reached a billion dollars, the threshold for the Department of Transportation to categorize America West as a major airline. The July 1990 timetable shows 182 weekday departures from Phoenix non-stop to 46 airports and 132 departures from Las Vegas to 39 airports. (24 LAS departures were between midnight and 01:40.)

The airline continued to lose money: operating expenses at Terminal 4 were far higher than in the temporary Terminal 3 concourse; the Nagoya route carried almost no passengers; tensions before the Gulf War caused fuel costs to rise. America West filed for bankruptcy in June 1991.

In June 1995, W. Douglas Parker joined America West as senior vice president and chief financial officer; he would be elected chairman, president and CEO in September 2001. The airline was fined $2.5 million for maintenance violations in July 1998, and in August 2000 the FAA was reportedly prepared to ground the airline for these violations.

===Bankruptcy===
America West operated under bankruptcy from 1991 to 1994; as part of the restructuring, employee stock became worthless, the airline&#x27;s 747s and Dash8s were sold and the fleet was pared down to 87 aircraft. Hawaii and Nagoya routes were scrapped and America West feeder service to smaller cities and local markets was contracted to Mesa Airlines, which began flying turboprops and regional jets as America West Express.

On the management side, Founder Ed Beauvais was removed as CEO, remaining on the board of directors, and was replaced with Mike Conway, who had been with the airline since the start. Conway left the airline in 1994, replaced as CEO by A. Maurice Myers.

America West&#x27;s flight attendants unionized in 1993, ending cross-utilization between customer service agents, flight attendants and ground agents. Several maintenance and training functions previously operated in-house by America West were outsourced during the bankruptcy.

===Reorganization===
In 1994, America West was finally able to secure a reorganization allowing it to come out of bankruptcy, with a large portion of the airline owned by a partnership including Mesa Airlines and Continental Airlines, resulting in code sharing agreements with these airlines.

To help reinvigorate the airline as they emerged from bankruptcy, a number of changes occurred, including a new color scheme and logo (used until the merger with US Airways), new livery, E-tickets, and online ticket purchasing in 1996. The airline continued ordering Airbus A320s and began gradually retiring their older Boeing 737-200s.

In 1993, America West opened a hub at Port Columbus International Airport in Columbus, Ohio, using Chautauqua Airlines and Mesa Airlines to provide commuter and regional flights via code sharing agreements in addition to mainline jets. An &quot;America West Club&quot; was at the hub in an area previously used for a TWA Ambassadors&#x27; Club.

In late 2001, America West was the first airline to apply for and receive a loan from the Air Transportation Stabilization Board. As of April 2005, the remaining balance on the loan was $300 million. The ATSB loan and its guarantees were paid back by US Airways and the debt refinanced by other lenders during the merger.

On May 1, 2002, America West ended its partnership with Continental Airlines, citing low code-shared flight sales.

In 2003, America West Airlines closed its Port Columbus hub, reducing scheduled daily flights from almost 50 to 4.

===US Airways===


In the second quarter of 2005, America West entered merger negotiations with then-bankrupt US Airways. It was structured as a purchase of US Airways by America West Holdings; however, the internal structure was a reverse merger, with legacy US Airways operations taken over by those of America West.

As the holding companies merged, brand conversion began. The America West Club was renamed the US Airways Club in October 2005. All-new America West aircraft were delivered in the new US Airways livery, and older aircraft repainted (while retaining America West interiors). Gates and ticket counters were consolidated at airports where both airlines had operated, aided by the March 2007 transfer of all US Airways reservations to the Shares computer system used by America West (US Airways had previously used a very different Sabre system).

All express flights were branded as US Airways Express and aircraft were no longer confined to operations out of their pre-merger hubs (America West aircraft could fly from Philadelphia to cities other than Phoenix and Las Vegas, for example). The two airlines&#x27; operating certificates were merged on September 25, 2007. After initially using the &quot;CACTUS&quot; callsign for the west fleet and &quot;USAIR&quot; for the east fleet, all aircraft began flying under a single &quot;CACTUS&quot; callsign and ICAO code &quot;AWE&quot; in September 2008. Meanwhile, US Airways abandoned Las Vegas as its hub. Former America West aircraft were distinguished apart from US Airways pre-merger aircraft by their use of registrations ending in &quot;-AW&quot;, while pre-merger US Airways aircraft used registrations ending in &quot;-US&quot;. US Airways would later merge with American Airlines in 2013, with the former America West callsign and ICAO code retired in 2015 (alongside with the US Airways brand). America West&#x27;s Phoenix hub has remained intact with American Airlines.

==Fleet==
===Final fleet===

As of September 27, 2005, at the time of the merger, America West Airlines&#x27; fleet consisted of the following aircraft:

===Retired fleet===
America West Airlines previously operated the following aircraft:

===America West Express aircraft===

America West Express services primarily operated by Mesa Airlines via a code sharing agreement with America West utilized the following regional jet and turboprop aircraft.

===Cancelled and planned orders===
In 1991, America West had plans for purchasing 4 Boeing 747-400 aircraft to replace the aging 747-200s in Honolulu service, but an order of 10 further Boeing 757-200s was also mentioned. Furthermore, it was in the plans to purchase 15 Airbus A318s in the late 1990s aside with their new orders of A320s at the time but this never came to fruition. America West had also planned on announcing an order of 60 aircraft on September 12, 2001, but this was quickly retracted after the September 11th attacks.

==FlightFund==
The airline had a frequent flyer program called FlightFund. In 2006, FlightFund was merged into the US Airways Dividend Miles program, which in turn merged into the American Airlines AAdvantage program in 2015.

==Destinations==
The following is a list airports that America West Airlines flew to as of September 24, 2007 (at the time of merger with US Airways).

==Codeshare agreements==
Throughout its existence, America West had codeshare agreements with the following airlines:

* Big Sky Airlines
* British Airways
* Chautauqua Airlines 
* Continental Airlines 
* EVA Air
* Hawaiian Airlines 
* Mesa Airlines 
* Northwest Airlines 
* Qantas 
* Royal Jordanian Airlines
* Trans World Airlines
* US Airways 
* Virgin Atlantic

==Headquarters==
America West had its headquarters in Tempe, Arizona from the airline&#x27;s start in 1983 and it retained the same location when it merged with US Airways and retained the US Airways name. The airline used the nine-story building as its headquarters once America West and US Airways merged, but the building has since been vacated when US Airways&#x27; management team took over American Airlines in an acquisition. Jahna Berry of the &quot;Arizona Business Gazette&quot; said in 2005 that the building &quot;is one of the dominant buildings in downtown Tempe.&quot; The City of Tempe gave America West $11 million in incentives and tax breaks so it could occupy the headquarters, which cost $37 million to construct. The construction of the building began in January 1998; the groundbreaking ceremony was held on February 19 of that year. The previous America West headquarters were demolished.

==Other commercial interests==
America West had promotional partnerships with the Phoenix Suns NBA team, the 2001 World Series champion Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team, and the Arizona Cardinals NFL team.

In 1992, America West paid $26 million for the 30-year naming rights of the Phoenix Suns&#x27; home court, which it named America West Arena. Since the merger with US Airways, the arena was called US Airways Center (not to be confused with the USAir Arena in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, razed in 2002), until it was renamed to Talking Stick Resort arena.

==Accidents and incidents==
America West had four in-flight incidents on its aircraft, but never had an accident resulting in a fatality. Two accidents resulted in hull loss write-offs.

<doc id="80405" wikidata="Q1129069" url="?curid=80405" title="Johnny Mnemonic (film)">
<text>Johnny Mnemonic is a 1995 cyberpunk action film directed by Robert Longo in his feature directorial debut. William Gibson, who wrote the 1981 short story, wrote the screenplay. The film, set in 2021, portrays a dystopian future racked by a tech-induced plague, awash with conspiracies, and dominated by megacorporations and organized crime. Keanu Reeves plays Johnny, a data courier with an overloaded brain implant designed to securely store confidential information. Takeshi Kitano portrays a yakuza affiliated with a megacorporation attempting to suppress the data; he uses his in-house psychopathic assassin played by Denis Akiyama to do so. Ice-T and Dina Meyer co-star as Johnny&#x27;s allies, a freedom fighter and a bodyguard, respectively.

It was shot in Canada; Toronto and Montreal filled in for Newark and Beijing. The project was difficult for Gibson and Longo. After they struggled for years to finance a low-budget adaptation of Gibson&#x27;s story, Sony greenlit &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot; with a $26 million budget. When Reeves&#x27; previous film, &quot;Speed&quot;, unexpectedly became a major hit, Sony attempted to retool &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot; as a blockbuster. Longo experienced extensive creative differences with the studio, who forced casting choices and script rewrites on him. The film was ultimately recut without Longo&#x27;s involvement, resulting in a version that he felt did not reflect his artistic vision. Described by Longo and Gibson as originally full of irony, it was edited into a mainstream action film and received negative reviews from critics.

A longer version (103 mins) of the film premiered in Japan on April 15, 1995, featuring a score by Mychael Danna and more scenes involving Kitano. The film was released in the United States on May 26, 1995. In 2022, a black-and-white edition of the film, titled &quot;Johnny Mnemonic: In Black and White&quot; was released, which Gibson characterized as closer to his original vision.

==Plot==
In 2021, society is driven by a virtual Internet, which has created a degenerative effect called &quot;nerve attenuation syndrome&quot; or NAS. Megacorporations control much of the world, intensifying the class hostility already created by NAS.

Johnny is a &quot;mnemonic courier&quot; who discreetly transports sensitive data for corporations in a storage device implanted in his brain at the cost of his childhood memories. His current job is for a group of scientists in Beijing. Johnny initially balks when he learns the data exceeds his memory capacity even with compression, but he agrees given the large fee will cover the cost of the operation to remove the device. Johnny keeps it secret that he is overloaded; he must have the data extracted within a few days or suffer fatal brain damage and corrupt the data. The scientists encrypt the data with three random images from a television feed. As they transmit these images to the receiver in Newark, New Jersey, they are attacked and killed by yakuza led by Shinji, who wields a laser whip. Johnny battles the yakuza, grabs a fragment of the encryption key images, and escapes. Shinji reports his failure to his superior, Takahashi. Their conversation reveals the yakuza are working on behalf of Pharmakom, a megacorporation. Johnny witnesses brief projections of a female artificial intelligence who attempts to aid him, but he dismisses her.

In Newark, Johnny meets with his handler Ralfi, who betrays him. Johnny is rescued from the yakuza by Jane, a cybernetically-enhanced bodyguard; members of the Lo-Teks, an anti-establishment group; and the Lo-Teks&#x27; leader, J-Bone. Ralfi is sliced into pieces when he gets in Shinji&#x27;s way. Jane takes Johnny to Spider, the doctor who installed Jane&#x27;s implants. At a clinic, Spider reveals his medical charity was intended to receive the Beijing scientists&#x27; data, which is a stolen cure for NAS. Spider claims Pharmakom refuses to release the cure because they are profiting off mitigation treatments. The portion of the encryption images Johnny took plus the piece Spider received are insufficient to decrypt Johnny&#x27;s mind, so Spider suggests they see Jones at the Lo-Teks&#x27; base. Suddenly, an assassin hired by Takahashi known as &quot;The Street Preacher&quot; attacks them, killing Spider as Johnny and Jane escape.

The two reach the Lo-Tek base and learn from J-Bone that Jones is a dolphin once used by the Navy that can help decrypt Johnny&#x27;s payload. As they start the procedure, Shinji and the yakuza attack the base. Takahashi appears and confronts Johnny, holding him at gunpoint, before Shinji, in a surprise betrayal, shoots Takahashi. Johnny and Shinji fight, culminating with Johnny killing Shinji. Before he dies, Takahashi has a change of heart and turns over a portion of the encryption key to Johnny. This still is not enough to fully decrypt the data. J-Bone tells Johnny that he will need to hack his own mind with Jones&#x27; help. Johnny, Jane, J-Bone and the Lo-Teks defeat the remaining forces sent after them. The Street Preacher arrives, and, after a fight, is electrocuted to death by Johnny and Jane.

The second attempt starts, and aided by the female AI, Johnny decrypts the data and simultaneously recovers his childhood memories. The AI is revealed to be a virtual version of Johnny&#x27;s mother, who founded Pharmakom and was angered by the company&#x27;s actions. As J-Bone transmits the NAS cure information across the internet via pirate broadcasts, Johnny and Jane watch from afar as the Pharmakom headquarters goes up in flames from the public outcry. In celebration, J-Bone disposes of the Street Preacher&#x27;s burnt corpse by tossing it into the waters of Newark.

==Production==

=== Development ===
In the 1980s, director Robert Longo was known primarily for his artwork, including &quot;Men in the Cities&quot;, a series of images meant to be viewed sequentially. After having been influenced by film, he transitioned to directing music videos and, when he tired of that, became interested in adapting William Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot;. Longo and Gibson first started work on a screenplay in 1989. Longo&#x27;s first attempt to finance the film was through Warner Bros. in 1990. Bob Krasnow liked Longo&#x27;s short film, &quot;Arena Brains&quot;, and offered to finance a feature film. Before pre-production could begin, Warner Bros. merged with Time Inc., and the film was put on hold. Recognizing the film was unlikely to be produced, Krasnow let Longo out of his contract. Longo nearly gave up on getting &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot; made but continued to make contacts in Hollywood.

Longo and Gibson sought to sell &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot; as an art film on a small budget but failed to get financing from the studios. Gibson said they wanted to avoid flashy, MTV-inspired visuals and &quot;plunge the audience into a very strange but consistent universe&quot;. Longo commented that the project &quot;started out as an arty 1½-million-dollar movie, and it became a 30-million-dollar movie because we couldn&#x27;t get a million and a half.&quot; Longo&#x27;s lawyer suggested that their problem was that they were not asking for enough money and that studios would not be interested in such a small project. Studios were also concerned that Longo&#x27;s artistic background would impact his ability to make a commercially viable film.

The unbounded spread of the Internet in the early 1990s and the consequent rapid growth of high technology culture had made cyberpunk increasingly relevant, and this was a primary motivation for Sony Pictures&#x27;s decision to fund the project in the tens of millions. Val Kilmer was originally cast in the title role, and Reeves replaced him when Kilmer dropped out. Gibson approved of this casting and said Reeves understood the character well. Reeves&#x27; Canadian nationality opened up further financial options, such as Canadian tax incentives. In Canada, Longo discovered he had to maintain Canadian crew quotas. Michael Chapman had agreed to shoot the film, but Longo had to hire a Canadian cinematographer instead.

=== Pre-production ===
When Reeves&#x27; previous film, &quot;Speed&quot;, turned into a major hit in 1994, expectations were raised for &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot;, and Sony saw the film as a potential blockbuster hit. Gibson said Sony executives began pressing them about whether their film had busses or explosions, critical elements of &quot;Speed&quot;.

Longo&#x27;s experiences with the financiers were poor, believing that their demands compromised his artistic vision. Many of the casting decisions, such as Lundgren, were forced upon Longo to increase the film&#x27;s appeal outside of the United States. Longo and Gibson, who had no idea what to do with Lundgren, created a new character for him. Lundgren had previously starred in several action films that emphasized his physique. He intended the role of the street preacher to be a showcase for further range as an actor, but his character&#x27;s monologue was cut during editing. Gibson said that the monologue, a sermon about transhumanism that Lundgren delivered naked, was cut due to fears of offending religious groups. Kitano was cast to appeal to the Japanese market. Rollins, who is uninterested in science fiction, joined the cast because he liked the film&#x27;s focus on an upcoming disadvantaged underclass.

The film significantly deviates from the short story, such as turning Johnny, not his bodyguard, into the primary action figure. Molly Millions is replaced with Jane, as the film rights to Molly had already been sold. Gibson did not want Molly in the film, though, and thought it would be best to reserve her for a different franchise. Nerve attenuation syndrome (NAS) is a fictional disease that is not present in the short story. NAS, also called &quot;the black shakes&quot;, is caused by an overexposure to electromagnetic radiation from omnipresent technological devices and is presented as a raging epidemic. In the film, one pharmaceutical corporation has found a cure but chooses to withhold it from the public in favor of a more lucrative treatment program. References to Jones the dolphin&#x27;s heroin addiction was one of many plot elements cut during editing.

=== Filming and post-production ===
Shooting took place in Toronto, where Longo temporarily moved his family, and Montreal.

The studio continued to challenge Gibson and Longo on the script through principal photography, making some of the shooting both tense and confusing. The script was meant to be a commentary on science fiction films and how they are made, and the action sequences were meant to be ironic and reminiscent of scenes that Gibson and Longo enjoyed in B movies. Gibson and Longo had instructed Reeves not to play the character straight. For his part, Reeves said he played the character &quot;very robotic and rigid&quot;, which he found exhausting. Reeves&#x27; suit and tie are a reference to &quot;Men in the Cities&quot;. When Johnny cries out for room service, this was a reflection of Longo&#x27;s frustration, and has also been identified as a reference to &quot;Men in the Cities&quot;. The ending, where the Street Preacher appears to revive, was forced on Longo, but he refused to shoot the scene straight, as requested. The studio approved of his version nonetheless. Eight minutes of extra footage starring Kitano was shot for the Japanese release of the film.

Gibson said that the film was &quot;taken away and re-cut by the American distributor&quot; during post-production. He described the original film as &quot;a very funny, very alternative piece of work&quot;, and said it was &quot;very unsuccessfully chopped and cut into something more mainstream&quot;. Gibson compared this to editing &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; into a mainstream thriller lacking any irony. Their editor, Ronald Sanders, was replaced by someone that Longo said did not understand the film. Prior to its release, critic Amy Harmon identified the film as an epochal moment when cyberpunk counterculture would enter the mainstream. News of the script&#x27;s compromises spurred pre-release concerns that the film would prove a disappointment to hardcore cyberpunks. Gibson said he and Longo were in denial at first and believed the film might still be true to their vision. Gibson did not blame anyone for the recut, though, reasoning that the film had been financed with their money. Despite claims made on the internet, the Japanese cut of the film is no closer to a director&#x27;s cut, and Longo has said that no director&#x27;s cut exists.

The score was composed by Brad Fiedel. Before Sony&#x27;s involvement, Black Rain composed a soundtrack. Black Rain had previously provided music for a Gibson audiobook and worked with Longo. Because no shooting had occurred yet, the band composed songs inspired by the original short story. Once Sony became involved, the soundtrack was replaced with Sony artists, such as Stabbing Westward.

==Release and marketing==
Simultaneous with Sony Pictures&#x27; release of the film, its soundtrack was released by Sony subsidiary Columbia Records, and the corporation&#x27;s digital effects division Sony ImageWorks issued a CD-ROM videogame version for MS-DOS, Mac, and Windows 3.x. The &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot; videogame, which was developed by Evolutionary Publishing, Inc. and directed by Douglas Gayeton, offered 90 minutes of full motion video storytelling and puzzles. A pinball machine, also titled &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot;, was released.

Sony realized early on the potential for reaching their target demographic through Internet marketing, and its new-technology division promoted the film with an online scavenger hunt offering $20,000 in prizes. One executive was quoted as remarking &quot;We see the Internet as turbo-charged word-of-mouth. Instead of one person telling another person something good is happening, it&#x27;s one person telling millions!&quot;. The film&#x27;s website, the first official site launched by Columbia TriStar Interactive, facilitated further cross-promotion by selling Sony Signatures-issued &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot; merchandise such as a &quot;hack your own brain&quot; T-shirt and Pharmakom coffee cups. Screenwriter William Gibson was deployed to field questions about the videogame from fans online. Despite having created &quot;cyberspace&quot;, one of the core metaphors for the internet age, Gibson had never been on the Internet previously. The habitually reclusive novelist likened the experience to &quot;taking a shower with a raincoat on&quot; and &quot;trying to do philosophy in Morse code&quot;. Gibson commented that the exercise seemed more like Sony testing the viability of internet marketing rather than an interactive event for their customers.

The film grossed ¥73.6 million ($897,600) in its first 3 days in Japan from 14 screens in the nine key Japanese cities. It was released in the United States and Canada on May 26 in 2,030 theaters, grossing $6 million in the opening weekend. It grossed $19.1 million in total in the United States and Canada against its $26 million budget. Gibson was told that the film performed well in Asia and was one of the few profitable films for Sony in 1995.

==Reception==
Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 20% of 40 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 4.3/10. The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;As narratively misguided as it is woefully miscast, &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot; brings the &#x27;90s cyberpunk thriller to inane new whoas – er, lows.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 36/100 based on 25 reviews, which the site terms &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot;″s Todd McCarthy called the film &quot;high-tech trash&quot; and likened it to a video game. Roger Ebert, the film critic for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, gave the film two stars out of four and called it &quot;one of the great goofy gestures of recent cinema&quot;. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; rated it C− and called it &quot;a slack and derivative future-shock thriller&quot;. Conversely, Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; described it as &quot;inescapably a very cool movie&quot;, and Marc Savlov wrote in &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; that the film works well for both Gibson fans and those unfamiliar with his work. Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Caryn James called the film &quot;a disaster in every way&quot; and said that despite Gibson&#x27;s involvement, the film comes off as &quot;a shabby imitation of &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and &quot;Total Recall&quot;&quot;.
McCarthy said that the film&#x27;s premise is its &quot;one bit of ingenuity&quot;, but the plot, which he called likely to disappoint Gibson&#x27;s fans, is simply an excuse for &quot;elaborate but undramatic and unexciting computer-graphics special effects&quot;. Ebert&#x27;s review mirrored this view. Sending a courier to physically deliver important information while avoiding enemy agents struck him as &quot;breathtakingly derivative&quot; and illogical outside the artificiality of a film when the internet is available. In his review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Peter Rainer wrote that the film, when stripped of the cyberpunk atmosphere, is recycled from noir fiction, and LaSalle viewed it more positively as &quot;a hard-boiled action story using technology as its backdrop&quot;. Savlov called it &quot;an updated &quot;D.O.A.&quot;&quot;, and Ebert said the film&#x27;s plot could have worked in any genre and been set in any time period.
James criticized the film&#x27;s lack of tension, and Rainer called the film&#x27;s tone too grim and lacking excitement. McCarthy criticized what he saw as a &quot;unrelieved grimness&quot; and &quot;desultory, darkly staged action scenes&quot;. McCarthy felt the film&#x27;s visual depiction of the future was unoriginal, and Gleiberman described the film as &quot;&quot;Blade Runner&quot; with tackier sets&quot;. Savlov wrote that Longo&#x27;s &quot;attempts to out-&quot;Blade Runner&quot; Ridley Scott in the decaying cityscape department grow wearisome&quot;. Savlov still found the film &quot;much better than expected&quot;. LaSalle felt the film &quot;introduces a fantastic yet plausible vision of a computer-dominated age&quot; and maintains a focus on humanity, in contrast to Rainer, who found the film&#x27;s countercultural pose to be inauthentic and lacking humanity. James called the film murky and colorless; Rainer&#x27;s review criticized similar issues, finding the film&#x27;s lack of lighting and its grim set design to give everything an &quot;undifferentiated dullness&quot;. McCarthy found the special effects to be &quot;slick and accomplished but unimaginative&quot;, though Ebert enjoyed the special effects. Gleiberman highlighted the laser whip as his favorite special effect, though James found it unimpressive.
Although saying that Reeves is not a good actor, LaSalle said Reeves is still enjoyable to watch and makes for a compelling protagonist. McCarthy instead found Reeves&#x27; character to be unlikable and one-dimensional. James compared Reeves to a robot, and Gleiberman compared him to an action figure. Rainer posited that Reeves&#x27; character may seem so blank due to his memory loss. Savlov said that Reeves&#x27; wooden delivery gives the film unintentional humor, but Rainer found that the lack of humor throughout the film sapped all the acting performances of any enjoyment. Gleiberman said that Reeves&#x27; efforts to avoid Valleyspeak backfire, giving his character&#x27;s lines &quot;an intense, misplaced urgency&quot;, though he liked the unconventional casting of Lundgren as a psychopathic street preacher. Rainer highlighted Lundgren as the only mirthful actor and said his performance was the best in the film. James called Ice-T&#x27;s role stereotypical and said he deserved better.

Reeves&#x27;s performance in the film earned him a Golden Raspberry Award nomination for Worst Actor (also for &quot;A Walk in the Clouds&quot;), but he lost to Pauly Shore for &quot;Jury Duty&quot;. The film was filed under the Founders Award (What Were They Thinking and Why?) at the 1995 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards and was also a dishonourable mention for Worst Picture. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

== Legacy ==
In a career retrospective of Reeves&#x27; films for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Chris Nashawaty ranked the film as Reeves&#x27; second worst, calling the film&#x27;s fans &quot;nuts&quot; for liking it. While acknowledging the film&#x27;s issues, critic Ty Burr attributed its poor reviews to critics&#x27; unfamiliarity with Gibson&#x27;s work. &quot;The Quietus&quot; described the film as having &quot;all the makings of a cult classic&quot;, and its release to streaming sites in 2021 resulted in a passionate defense by Rowan Righelato in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, who said it was &quot;a testament to Longo&#x27;s genius&quot; that the film remained as eccentric as it was despite the studio&#x27;s recut. &quot;Inverse&quot; also recommended the film. In a retrospective review from 2021, Peter Bradshaw, film critic for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, rated it 4/5 stars and wrote, &quot;Perhaps it&#x27;s quaint, but it&#x27;s also watchable, and it is the kind of sci-fi that is genuinely audacious&quot;.

The Wachowskis used &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot; as template for describing &quot;The Matrix&quot; to investors, and the 2011 video game &quot;Deus Ex: Human Revolution&quot; was influenced by &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot;. The props from the film were transformed into sculptures by artist Dora Budor for her 2015 solo exhibition, &quot;Spring&quot;.

== Johnny Mnemonic: In Black and White ==

Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released &quot;Johnny Mnemonic: In Black and White&quot; on Blu-ray in the United States on August 16, 2022.

A black-and-white version of the theatrical cut, the edition was developed by Robert Longo. While not a director&#x27;s cut, it is nonetheless closer to Longo&#x27;s intended vision for the film; he had desired to shoot in black-and-white but was denied the opportunity. Initially, for the film&#x27;s 25th anniversary, Longo ripped a Blu-ray copy of the film and created a black-and-white version of the film himself. After contacting Don Carmody and informing him of his intention to release the new version of the film on YouTube, Carmody requested to see it first. Impressed, Carmody convinced Longo to approach Sony Pictures for an official release. Sony Pictures agreed to provide the film&#x27;s footage to Longo for a professional conversion, so that they could release the new version on Blu-ray. Longo proceeded to re-grade the film&#x27;s color in black-and-white, with the help of the film&#x27;s original colorist Cyrus Stowe. Longo has stated that he is &quot;happy&quot; with the new version of the film, as he takes inspiration from black-and-white films such as &quot;Alphaville&quot; and &quot;La Jetée&quot;. The new version was shown by the Tribeca and Rockaway Film Festivals at an outdoor screening, which sold out, in 2021.

<doc id="80408" wikidata="Q275186" url="?curid=80408" title="Gang">
<text>A gang is a group or society of associates, friends, or members of a family with a defined leadership and internal organization that identifies with or claims control over in a community and engages, either individually or collectively, in illegal, and possibly violent, behavior, with such behavior often constituting a form of organized crime.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;gang&quot; derives from the past participle of Old English , meaning . It is cognate with Old Norse , meaning . While the term often refers specifically to criminal groups, it also has a broader meaning of any close or organized group of people, and may have neutral, positive or negative connotations depending on usage.

==History==
In discussing the banditry in American history, Barrington Moore, Jr. suggests that gangsterism as a &quot;form of self-help which victimizes others&quot; may appear in societies which lack strong &quot;forces of law and order&quot;; he characterizes European feudalism as &quot;mainly gangsterism that had become society itself and acquired respectability through the notions of chivalry&quot;.

The 17th century saw London &quot;terrorized by a series of organized gangs&quot;,
some of them known as the Mims, Hectors, Bugles, and Dead Boys. These gangs often came into conflict with each other. Members dressed &quot;with colored ribbons to distinguish the different factions.&quot; During the Victorian era, criminals and gangs started to form organizations which would collectively become London&#x27;s criminal underworld. Criminal societies in the underworld started to develop their own ranks and groups which were sometimes called &quot;families&quot;, and were often made up of lower-classes and operated on pick-pocketry, prostitution, forgery and counterfeiting, commercial burglary, and money laundering schemes. Unique also were the use of slangs and argots used by Victorian criminal societies to distinguish each other, like those propagated by street gangs like the Peaky Blinders.

In the United States, the history of gangs began on the East Coast in 1783 following the American Revolution. Gangs arose further in the United States by the middle of the nineteenth century and were a concern for city leaders from the time they appeared. The emergence of the gangs was largely attributed to the vast rural population immigration to the urban areas. The first street-gang in the United States, the 40 Thieves, began around the late 1820s in New York City. The gangs in Washington D.C. had control of what is now Federal Triangle, in a region then known as Murder Bay. Organized crime in the United States first came to prominence in the Old West and historians such as Brian J. Robb and Erin H. Turner traced the first organized crime syndicates to the Coschise Cowboy Gang and the Wild Bunch. Prohibition would also cause a new boom in the emergence of gangs; Chicago for example had over 1,000 gangs in the 1920s.

Outside of the US and the UK, gangs exist in both urban and rural forms, like the French gangs of the Belle Époque like the Apaches and the Bonnot Gang. Many criminal organizations, such as the Italian Cosa Nostra, Japanese yakuza, Russian Bratva, and Chinese triads, have existed for centuries.

==Types==
Gangs, syndicates, and other criminal groups, come in many forms, each with their own specialties and gang culture.

===Mafia===
One of the most infamous criminal gangs are Mafias, whose activities include racketeering and overseeing illicit agreements. These include the Sicilian Cosa Nostra and the Italian–American Mafia. The Neapolitan Camorra, the Calabrian &#x27;Ndrangheta and the Apulian Sacra Corona Unita are similar Italian organized gangs. Outside of Italy, the Irish Mob, Japanese yakuza, Chinese triads, British firms, and Russian Bratva are also examples.

===Narco===
Narcos or drug cartels are slang terms used for criminal groups (mainly Latin Americans) who primarily deal with the illegal drug trade. These include drug cartels like the Medellin Cartel and other Colombian cartels, Mexican cartels like the Sinaloa Cartel and Los Zetas, and the Primeiro Comando da Capital in Brazil. Other examples are Jamaican Yardies and the various opium barons in the Golden Triangle and Golden Crescent. Many narcos are known for their use of paramilitaries and narcoterrorism like the Gulf Cartel and Shower Posse.

===Street===

Street gangs are gangs formed by youths in urban areas, and are known primarily for street fighting and gang warfare. The term &quot;street gang&quot; is commonly used interchangeably with &quot;youth gang&quot;, referring to neighborhood or street-based youth groups that meet &quot;gang&quot; criteria. Miller (1992) defines a street gang as &quot;a self-formed association of peers, united by mutual interests, with identifiable leadership and internal organization, who act collectively or as individuals to achieve specific purposes, including the conduct of illegal activity and control of a particular territory, facility, or enterprise.&quot; Some of the well-known ones are the Black gangs like the Bloods and the Crips, also the Vice Lords and the Gangster Disciples. Other racial gangs also exist like the Trinitario, Sureños, Tiny Rascal Gang, Asian Boyz, Wa Ching, Zoe Pound, The Latin Kings, The Hammerskins, Nazi Lowriders and Blood &amp; Honour.

=== Law enforcement ===
Law enforcement gangs are criminal organizations that form and operate within law enforcement agencies. Members have been accused of significant department abuses of policy and constitutional rights, terrifying the general population, intimidating their colleagues, and retaliating against whistleblowers. Leaders called &quot;shot-callers&quot; control many aspects of local policing, including promotions, scheduling, and enforcement. They operate in the gray areas of law enforcement, perpetuate a culture of silence, and promote a mentality of punisher-style retaliation.

===Biker===
Biker gangs are motorcycle clubs who conduct illegal activities like the Hells Angels, the Pagans, the Outlaws, and the Bandidos, known as the &quot;Big Four&quot; in the United States. The U.S. Department of Justice defines outlaw motorcycle gangs (OMG) as &quot;organizations whose members use their motorcycle clubs as conduits for criminal enterprises&quot;. Some clubs are considered &quot;outlaw&quot; not necessarily because they engage in criminal activity, but because they are not sanctioned by the American Motorcyclist Association and do not adhere to its rules. Instead the clubs have their own set of bylaws reflecting the outlaw biker culture.

Biker gangs such as the Rebels Motorcycle Club exist in Australia.

===Prison===
Prison gangs are formed inside prisons and correctional facilities for mutual protection and entrancement like the Mexican Mafia and United Blood Nation. Prison gangs often have several &quot;affiliates&quot; or &quot;chapters&quot; in different state prison systems that branch out due to the movement or transfer of their members. According to criminal justice professor John Hagedorn, many of the biggest gangs from Chicago originated from prisons. From the St. Charles Illinois Youth Center originated the Conservative Vice Lords and Blackstone Rangers. Although the majority of gang leaders from Chicago are now incarcerated, most of those leaders continue to manage their gangs from within prison.

===Punk===
Punk gangs are a unique type of gang made up of members who follow the punk rock ideology. Unlike other gangs and criminal groups, punk gangs follow a range of political and philosophical beliefs that can range from alt-right to radical left. Differing ideologies are one of the causes of conflicts between rival punk gangs, compared to other street gangs and criminal groups who wage gang war solely for illegal profit, vendetta, and territory. Most of them can be seen in political and social protests and demonstrations and are sometimes in violent confrontation with law-enforcement. Examples of punk gangs are Fight For Freedom, Friends Stand United, and Straight Edge gangs.

===Vigilante===
Contemporary organized crime has also led to the creation of anti-gang groups, vigilante gangs, and autodefensas, who are groups who profess to be fighting against gang influence, but share characteristics and acts similarly to a gang. These include groups like the Los Pepes, Sombra Negra, Friends Stand United, People Against Gangsterism and Drugs, and OG Imba.

==Structure==
Many types of gangs make up the general structure of an organized group. Understanding the structure of gangs is a critical skill to defining the types of strategies that are most effective with dealing with them, from the at-risk youth to the gang leaders. Not all individuals who display the outward signs of gang membership are actually involved in criminal activities. An individual&#x27;s age, sexual identity, physical structure, ability to fight, willingness to commit violence, and arrest record are often principal factors in determining where an individual stands in the gang hierarchy; how money derived from criminal activity and ability to provide for the gang also impacts the individual&#x27;s status within the gang. The structure of gangs varies depending primarily on size, which can range from five or ten to thousands. Many of the larger gangs break up into smaller groups, cliques or sub-sets (these smaller groups can be called &quot;sets&quot; in gang slang.) The cliques typically bring more territory to a gang as they expand and recruit new members. Most gangs operate informally with leadership falling to whoever takes control; others have distinct leadership and are highly structured, which resembles more or less a business or corporation.

Criminal gangs may function both inside and outside of prison, such as the Nuestra Familia, Mexican Mafia, Folk Nation, and the Brazilian PCC. During the 1970s, prison gangs in Cape Town, South Africa began recruiting street gang members from outside and helped increase associations between prison and street gangs.
In the US, the prison gang the Aryan Brotherhood is involved in organized crime outside of prison.

==Membership==
Different gangs and criminal syndicates have various roles and members. Most are typically divided into:
* Boss: known in some groups as leader, elder, don, &quot;oyabun&quot;, or &quot;original gangster&quot;, is the one who has control over the movement, plans, and actions of a gang. Gang leaders are the upper echelons of the gang&#x27;s command. Often, they distance themselves from the gang activities and make attempts to appear legitimate, possibly operating a business that they run as a front for the gang&#x27;s drug dealing or other illegal operations.
* Underboss: the second in command of the gang. 
* Captain: is the one who issue the command from the boss/underboss to the gangsters. Captain is responsible for the activities in the field and of the recruitment of new members.
* Gangsters: also known as soldiers, &quot;soldatos&quot;, or &quot;kobun&quot;, are the typical gang members who commit the activities of the gang.
* Associates: known also as gang affiliates or &quot;hang-arounds&quot;, are people who are not full members of the gang, but either support and participate in the activities of a gang, or have livelihoods tied to gang activities. Included here are specialized roles like enforcers (hitmen who work for criminal organizations), falcons (&quot;eyes and ears&quot; of the streets), and mules (smugglers who transport drugs, money, and other contraband materials).

The numerous push factors experienced by at-risk individuals vary situationally, but follow a common theme of the desire for power, respect, money, and protection. In neighborhoods with high levels of violence, adolescents typically experience pressure to join a street gang for protection from other violent actors (sometimes including police violence and the waging of the war on drugs), perpetuating a cycle of violence. These desires are very influential in attracting individuals to join gangs, and their influence is particularly strong on at-risk youth. Such individuals are often experiencing low levels of these various factors in their own lives, feeling ostracized from their community and lacking social support. Joining a gang may appear to them to be the only way to obtain status and material success or escape a cycle of poverty through profits from illegal activity. They may feel that &quot;if you can&#x27;t beat &#x27;em, join &#x27;em&quot;. Upon joining a gang, they instantly gain a feeling of belonging and identity; they are surrounded with individuals whom they can relate to. They have generally grown up in the same area as one another and can bond over similar needs. In some areas, joining a gang is an integrated part of the growing-up process.

Gang membership is generally maintained by gangs as a lifetime commitment, reinforced through identification such as tattoos, and ensured through intimidation and coercion. Gang defectors are often subject to retaliation from the deserted gang. Many gangs, including foreign and transnational gangs, hold that the only way to leave the gang is through death. This is sometimes informally called the &quot;morgue rule&quot;.

Gang membership represents the phenomenon of a chronic group criminal spin; accordingly, the criminality of members is greater when they belong to the gang than when they are not in the gang—either before or after being in the gang. In addition, when together, the gang criminality as a whole is greater than that of its members when they are alone. The gang operates as a whole greater than its parts and influences the behavior of its members in the direction of greater extend and stronger degree of criminality.

Some states have a formal process to establish that a person is a member of a gang, called validation. Once a person is validated as a gang member, the person is subject to increased sentences, harsher punishments (such as solitary confinement) and more restrictive parole rules. To validate a person as a gang member, the officials generally must provide evidence of several factors, such as tattoos, photographs, admissions, clothing, etc. The legal requirements for validating a person are much lower than the requirements for convicting of a crime.

===Non-member women===
Women associated with gangs but who lack membership are typically categorized based on their relation to gang members. A survey of Mexican American gang members and associates defined these categories as girlfriends, hoodrats, good girls, and relatives. Girlfriends are long-term partners of male gang members, and may have children with them. &quot;&quot; are seen as being promiscuous and heavy drug and alcohol users. Gang members may engage in casual sex with these girls, but they are not viewed as potential long-term partners and are severely stigmatized by both men and women in gang culture. &quot;Good girls&quot; are long-term friends of members, often from childhood, and relatives are typically sisters or cousins. These are fluid categories, and women often change status as they move between them.
Valdez found that women with ties to gang members are often used to hold illegal weapons and drugs, typically, because members believe the girls are less likely to be searched by police for such items.

=== Initiation===
Different gangs from around the world have their way of recruiting and introducing new members. Most criminal gangs require an interested candidate to commit a crime to be inducted into a gang. Many street gangs, like the Bloods and MS-13, have a ritual where they would beat up (also known as &quot;beat-in&quot; or &quot;jump-in&quot;) aspiring applicants for several seconds to show their toughness, willingness, and loyalty. Some of these gangs allow women to become members either through being jumped-in or having sex with male members (known as &quot;sexed-in&quot;).

Biker gangs like the Hells Angels require a candidate, known as a &quot;hang-around&quot;, to be observed and mentored by veteran gang members (which can last a year or more) in order to assess their personalities and commitment. The Cosa Nostra requires people wanting to be full members or become made men to take part in a ceremony involving oaths, agreement, and bloodletting to show their loyalty. The Sigue-Sigue Sputnik from the Philippines require gang members to tattoo (or &quot;tatak&quot;) the name of the gang or their leader into their body. Triads have a more unique way of initiating associates into full members. Triad ceremonies take place at an altar dedicated to Guan Yu (關羽, GuānYǔ), with incense and an animal sacrifice (usually a chicken, pig or goat).

===Training===
Training and expertise in various forms of illicit activities, including combat, exist variously throughout different gangs. Specific members of American mafia groups, like police infiltrators, double agents, and sometimes also enforcers and hitmen, have had backgrounds in law enforcement or the military. Sicilian mafia and Calabrian Mafia in Southern Italy became notorious for creating &quot;schools&quot; in the countryside to train children as young as eleven in weapons and illegal activities. Giovanni Tinebra, the chief public prosecutor of Caltanissetta, once stated, &quot;Instead of going to school, many boys go into the countryside where there are people who teach them to shoot and turn them into killing machines.&quot;

Some drug cartels in Colombia and Mexico have established themselves as paramilitaries. The earliest and most famous example was the time when the Medellin Cartel hired Israeli soldier Yair Klein to train militiamen and assassins. Los Zetas became infamous for being founded by US-trained Mexican commandos. Together with Kaibiles from Guatemala, they set up camps to train future sicarios and soldatos. Other Mexican cartels who trained their members include the Jalisco Cartel, who trained their members for three months in ambushes, codes of silence and discipline, inside camps.

In the case of street gangs, most do not train their members in shooting and combat. Although a few would train their youths how to shoot using empty cans and bottles as targets (with some cases using underground shooting ranges), most gangsters have no formal instructions in firearms usage and safety. The late 90s and early 2000s saw many gang members in the US being sent by judges to the military to “set them on the right path”, which only led to these street gangs gaining military training and experience. Many street gangs, most notably African-American gangs like the Folk Nation and Bloods, continue to have a presence in the US Military.

==Typical activities==
The United Nations estimates that gangs make most of their money through the drugs trade, which is thought to be worth $352 billion in total. The United States Department of Justice estimates there are approximately 30,000 gangs, with 760,000 members, impacting 2,500 communities across the United States.

Gangs are involved in all areas of street-crime activities like extortion, drug trafficking, both in and outside the prison system, and theft. Gangs also victimize individuals by robbery and kidnapping. Cocaine is the primary drug of distribution by gangs in America, which have used the cities Chicago, Cape Town, and Rio de Janeiro to transport drugs internationally. Brazilian urbanization has driven the drug trade to the favelas of Rio. Often, gangs hire &quot;lookouts&quot; to warn members of upcoming law enforcement. The dense environments of favelas in Rio and public housing projects in Chicago have helped gang members hide from police easily.

Street gangs take over territory or &quot;turf&quot; in a particular city and are often involved in &quot;providing protection&quot;, often a thin cover for extortion, as the &quot;protection&quot; is usually from the gang itself, or in other criminal activity. Many gangs use fronts to demonstrate influence and gain revenue in a particular area.

==Violence==


Gang violence refers mostly to the illegal and non-political acts of violence perpetrated by gangs against civilians, other gangs, law enforcement officers, firefighters, or military personnel. A gang war is a type of small war that occurs when two gangs end up in a feud over territory or vendetta. Gang warfare mostly consists of sanctioned and unsanctioned hits, street fighting, and gun violence.

Modern gangs introduced new acts of violence, which may also function as a rite of passage for new gang members. In 2006, 58 percent of L.A.&#x27;s murders were gang-related. Reports of gang-related homicides are concentrated mostly in the largest cities in the United States, where there are long-standing and persistent gang problems and a greater number of documented gang members—most of whom are identified by law enforcement. Gang-related activity and violence has increased along the U.S. Southwest border region, as US-based gangs act as enforcers for Mexican drug cartels.

=== Schools ===
Despite gangs usually formed in the community, not specifically in schools, gang violence can potentially affect schools in different ways including:

* Gangs can recruit members in schools;
* Gang members from the same school can engage in violence on the school premises or around their school;
* Gang members from the same school can commit violence against other students in the same school who belong to a different gang or who do not belong to a gang;
* Gangs may commit violence against other schools and students in the community where they are active, even if these students do not belong to a gang.

Global data on the prevalence of these different forms of gang violence in and around schools is limited. Some evidence suggests that gang violence is more common in schools where students are exposed to other forms of community violence and where they fear violence at school.

Children who grow up in neighbourhoods with high levels of crime has been identified as a risk factor for youth violence, including gang violence. According to studies, children who knew many adult criminals were more likely to engage in violent behaviour by the age of 18 years than those who did not.

Gang violence is often associated with carrying weapons, including in school. A study of 10-to-19-year-olds in the UK found that 44% of those who reported belonging to a delinquent youth group had committed violence and 13% had carried a knife in the previous 12 months versus 17% and 4% respectively among those who were not in such a group.

According to a meta-analysis of 14 countries in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Central and South America, sub-Saharan Africa and the Pacific also showed that carrying a weapon at school is associated with bullying victimization.

Comparison of Global School-based Student Health Survey (GSHS) data on school violence and bullying for countries that are particularly affected by gang violence suggests that the links may be limited. In El Salvador and Guatemala, for example, where gang violence is a serious problem, GSHS data show that the prevalence of bullying, physical fights and physical attacks reported by school students is relatively low, and is similar to prevalence in other countries in Central America where gang violence is less prevalent.

===Sexual violence===
Women in gang culture are often in environments where sexual assault is common and considered to be a norm. Women who attend social gatherings and parties with heavy drug and alcohol use are particularly likely to be assaulted. A girl who becomes intoxicated and flirts with men is often seen as &quot;asking for it&quot; and is written off as a &quot;hoe&quot; by men and women. &quot;Hoodrats&quot; and girls associated with rival gangs have lower status at these social events, and are victimized when members view them as fair game and other women rationalize assault against them.

==Motives==

Most modern research on gangs has focused on the thesis of class struggle following the work of Walter B. Miller and Irving Spergel. In this body of work The Gaylords are cited as the prime example of an American gang that is neither black nor Hispanic. Some researchers have focused on ethnic factors. Frederic Thrasher, who was a pioneer of gang research, identified &quot;demoralization&quot; as a standard characteristic of gangs. John Hagedorn has argued that this is one of three concepts that shed light on patterns of organization in oppressed racial, religious and ethnic groups (the other two are Manuel Castells&#x27; theory of &quot;resistance identity&quot; and Derrick Bell&#x27;s work on the permanence of racism).

Usually, gangs have gained the most control in poorer, urban communities and developing countries in response to unemployment and other services. Social disorganization, and the disintegration of societal institutions such as family, school, and the public safety net, enable groups of peers to form gangs. According to surveys conducted internationally by the World Bank for their World Development Report 2011, by far the most common reason people suggest as a motive for joining gangs is unemployment.

Ethnic solidarity is a common factor in gangs. Black and Hispanic gangs formed during the 1960s in the USA often adapted nationalist rhetoric. Both majority and minority races in society have established gangs in the name of identity: the Igbo gang Bakassi Boys in Nigeria defend the majority Igbo group violently and through terror, and in the United States, whites who feel threatened by minorities have formed their own gangs, such as the Ku Klux Klan. Responding to an increasing black and Hispanic migration, a white gang formed called Chicago Gaylords. Some gang members are motivated by religion, as is the case with the Muslim Patrol and the Epstein-Wolmark gang.

==Identification==
Most gang members have identifying characteristics which are unique to their specific clique or gang. The Bloods, for instance, wear red bandanas, the Crips blue, allowing these gangs to &quot;represent&quot; their affiliation. Any disrespect of a gang member&#x27;s color by an unaffiliated individual is regarded as grounds for violent retaliation, often by multiple members of the offended gang. Tattoos are also common identifiers, such as an &#x27;18&#x27; above the eyebrow to identify a member of the 18th Street gang. Tattoos help a gang member gain respect within their group, and mark them as members for life. Tattoos can also represent the level they are in the gang, being that certain tattoos can mean they are a more accomplished member. The accomplishments can be related to doing a dangerous act that showed your loyalty to the gang. They can be burned on as well as inked. Some gangs make use of more than one identifier, like the Nortenos, who wear red bandanas and have &quot;14&quot;, &quot;XIV&quot;, &quot;x4&quot;, and &quot;Norte&quot; tattoos. Some members of criminal gangs are &quot;jumped in&quot; (by going through a process of initiation), or have to prove their loyalty and right to belong by committing certain acts, usually theft or violence.
Gangs often establish distinctive, characteristic identifiers including graffiti tags colors, hand signals, clothing (for example, the gangsta rap-type hoodies), jewelry, hair styles, fingernails, slogans, signs (such as the noose and the burning cross as the symbols of the Klan), flags secret greetings, slurs, or code words and other group-specific symbols associated with the gang&#x27;s common beliefs, rituals, and mythologies to define and differentiate themselves from other groups and gangs.

As an alternative language, hand-signals, symbols, and slurs in speech, graffiti, print, music, or other mediums communicate specific informational cues used to threaten, disparage, taunt, harass, intimidate, alarm, influence, or exact specific responses including obedience, submission, fear, or terror. One study focused on terrorism and symbols states that &quot;[s]ymbolism is important because it plays a part in impelling the terrorist to act and then in defining the targets of their actions.&quot; Displaying a gang sign, such as the noose, as a symbolic act can be construed as &quot;a threat to commit violence communicated with the intent to terrorize another, to cause evacuation of a building, or to cause serious public inconvenience, in reckless disregard of the risk of causing such terror or inconvenience … an offense against property or involving danger to another person that may include but is not limited to recklessly endangering another person, harassment, stalking, ethnic intimidation, and criminal mischief.&quot;

The Internet is one of the most significant media used by gangs to communicate in terms of the size of the audience they can reach with minimal effort and reduced risk. Social media provides a forum for recruitment activities, typically provoking rival gangs through derogatory postings, and to glorify their gang and themselves.

==US impact debate==
Researchers and activists in the United States have debated the true impact of US gangs on crime in the United States, with a 2019 episode of the You&#x27;re Wrong About podcast claiming that the perceived increase in gang violence was in fact an overblown moral panic. There have been repeated complaints of bias around the enforcement of gang-related laws asking why Frats and Gangs are treated differently &quot;They&#x27;re both blamed for predisposing their members to violent acts, but they&#x27;ve sparked radically different public-policy responses.&quot;

Activists have also made the link between a perceived increase in gang activity and the sharp rise in US police budgets while pointing out rampant corruption in police gang units, such as the Rampart scandal in the Los Angeles Police Department.

==UK impact debate==
In the UK context, law enforcement agencies are increasingly focusing enforcement efforts on gangs and gang membership. Debate persists over the extent and nature of gang activity in the UK, with some academics and policy-makers arguing that the current focus is inadvisable, given a lack of consensus over the relationship between gangs and crime.

The Runnymede Trust suggests, despite the well-rehearsed public discourse around youth gangs and gang culture, &quot;We actually know very little about &#x27;gangs&#x27; in the UK: about how &#x27;a gang&#x27; might be defined or understood, about what being in &#x27;a gang&#x27; means ... We know still less about how &#x27;the gang&#x27; links to levels of youth violence.&quot;

Professor Simon Hallsworth argues that, where they exist, gangs in the UK are &quot;far more fluid, volatile and amorphous than the myth of the organized group with a corporate structure&quot;. This assertion is supported by a field study conducted by Manchester University, which found that &quot;most within- and between-gang disputes ... emanated from interpersonal disputes regarding friends, family and romantic relationships&quot;, as opposed to territorial rivalries, and that criminal enterprises were &quot;rarely gang-coordinated ... most involved gang members operating as individuals or in small groups.&quot;

Cottrell-Boyce, writing in the &quot;Youth Justice&quot; journal, argues that gangs have been constructed as a &quot;suitable enemy&quot; by politicians and the media, obscuring the wider, structural roots of youth violence. At the level of enforcement, a focus on gang membership may be counterproductive; creating confusion and resulting in a drag-net approach which can criminalise innocent young people rather than focusing resources on serious violent crime.

==United States military==
Gang members in uniform use their military knowledge, skills and weapons to commit and facilitate various crimes. As of April 2011, the NGIC has identified members of at least 53 gangs whose members have served in or are affiliated with US military.

In 2006, Scott Barfield, a Defense Department investigator, said there is an online network of gangs and extremists: &quot;They&#x27;re communicating with each other about weapons, about recruiting, about keeping their identities secret, about organizing within the military.&quot;

A 2006 &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; article reported that gangs encourage members to enter the military to learn urban warfare techniques to teach other gang members. A January 2007 article in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; reported that gang members in the military are involved in the theft and sale of military weapons, ammunition, and equipment, including body armor. The &quot;Sun-Times&quot; began investigating the gang activity in the military after receiving photos of gang graffiti showing up in Iraq.

The FBI&#x27;s 2007 report on gang membership in the military states that the military&#x27;s recruit screening process is ineffective, allows gang members/extremists to enter the military, and lists at least eight instances in the last three years in which gang members have obtained military weapons for their illegal enterprises. &quot;Gang Activity in the U.S. Armed Forces Increasing&quot;, dated January 12, 2007, states that street gangs including the Bloods, Crips, Black Disciples, Gangster Disciples, Hells Angels, Latin Kings, The 18th Street Gang, Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13), Mexican Mafia, Norteños, Sureños, and Vice Lords have been documented on military installations both domestic and international although recruiting gang members violates military regulations.

<doc id="80441" wikidata="Q44007" url="?curid=80441" title="Paul Klee">
<text>Paul Klee (; 18 December 1879 – 29 June 1940) was a Swiss-born German artist. His highly individual style was influenced by movements in art that included expressionism, cubism, and surrealism. Klee was a natural draftsman who experimented with and eventually deeply explored color theory, writing about it extensively; his lectures &quot;Writings on Form and Design Theory&quot; (&quot;Schriften zur Form und Gestaltungslehre&quot;), published in English as the &quot;Paul Klee Notebooks&quot;, are held to be as important for modern art as Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;A Treatise on Painting&quot; was for the Renaissance. He and his colleague, Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky, both taught at the Bauhaus school of art, design and architecture in Germany. His works reflect his dry humor and his sometimes childlike perspective, his personal moods and beliefs, and his musicality.

== Early life and training ==
Paul Klee was born in Münchenbuchsee, Switzerland, as the second child of German music teacher Hans Wilhelm Klee (1849–1940) and Swiss singer Ida Marie Klee, born Frick (1855–1921). His sister Mathilde (died 6 December 1953) was born on 28 January 1876 in Walzenhausen. Their father came from Tann and studied singing, piano, organ and violin at the Stuttgart Conservatory, where he met his future wife Ida Frick. Hans Wilhelm Klee was active as a music teacher at the Bern State Seminary in Hofwil near Bern until 1931. Klee was able to develop his music skills as his parents encouraged and inspired him throughout his life.

In 1880, his family moved to Bern, where they eventually, in 1897, after a number of changes of residence, moved into their own house in the . From 1886 to 1890, Klee visited primary school and received, at the age of 7, violin classes at the Municipal Music School. He was so talented on violin that, aged 11, he received an invitation to play as an extraordinary member of the Bern Music Association. His other hobbies, drawing and writing poems, were not fostered in the same way as music was.
In his early years, following his parents&#x27; wishes, Klee focused on becoming a musician; but he decided on the visual arts during his teen years, partly out of rebellion and partly because modern music lacked meaning for him. He stated, &quot;I didn&#x27;t find the idea of going in for music creatively particularly attractive in view of the decline in the history of musical achievement.&quot; As a musician, he played and felt emotionally bound to traditional works of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, but as an artist he craved the freedom to explore radical ideas and styles. At sixteen, Klee&#x27;s landscape drawings already show considerable skill.

Around 1897, Klee started his diary, which he kept until 1918, and which has provided scholars with valuable insight into his life and thinking. During his school years, he avidly drew in his school books, in particular drawing caricatures, and already demonstrating skill with line and volume. He barely passed his final exams at the &quot;Gymnasium&quot; of Bern, where he qualified in the Humanities. With his characteristic dry wit, he wrote, &quot;After all, it&#x27;s rather difficult to achieve the &quot;exact&quot; minimum, and it involves risks.&quot; On his own time, in addition to his deep interests in music and art, Klee was a great reader of literature, and later a writer on art theory and aesthetics.

With his parents&#x27; reluctant permission, in 1898 Klee began studying art at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich with Heinrich Knirr and Franz von Stuck. He excelled at drawing but seemed to lack any natural color sense. He later recalled, &quot;During the third winter I even realized that I probably would never learn to paint.&quot; During these times of youthful adventure, Klee spent much time in pubs and had affairs with lower-class women and artists&#x27; models. He had an illegitimate son in 1900 who died several weeks after birth.

After receiving his Fine Arts degree, Klee traveled in Italy from October 1901 to May 1902 with friend Hermann Haller. They visited Rome, Florence, Naples and the Amalfi Coast, studying the master painters of past centuries. He exclaimed, &quot;The Forum and the Vatican have spoken to me. Humanism wants to suffocate me.&quot; He responded to the colors of Italy, but sadly noted, &quot;that a long struggle lies in store for me in this field of color.&quot; For Klee, color represented the optimism and nobility in art, and a hope for relief from the pessimistic nature he expressed in his black-and-white grotesques and satires. Returning to Bern, he lived with his parents for several years, and took occasional art classes. By 1905, he was developing some experimental techniques, including drawing with a needle on a blackened pane of glass, resulting in fifty-seven works including his &quot;Portrait of My Father&quot; (1906). In the years 1903–05 he also completed a cycle of eleven zinc-plate etchings called &quot;Inventions&quot;, his first exhibited works, in which he illustrated several grotesque characters. He commented, &quot;though I&#x27;m fairly satisfied with my etchings I can&#x27;t go on like this. I&#x27;m not a specialist.&quot; Klee was still dividing his time with music, playing the violin in an orchestra and writing concert and theater reviews.

==Marriage and early years==

===Marriage===
Klee married Bavarian pianist Lily Stumpf in 1906 and they had one son named Felix Paul in the following year. They lived in a suburb of Munich, and while she gave piano lessons and occasional performances, he kept house and tended to his art work. His attempt to be a magazine illustrator failed. Klee&#x27;s art work progressed slowly for the next five years, partly from having to divide his time with domestic matters, and partly as he tried to find a new approach to his art. In 1910, he had his first solo exhibition in Bern, which then travelled to three Swiss cities.

=== Affiliation to the &quot;Blaue Reiter&quot;, 1911 ===
In January 1911, Alfred Kubin met Klee in Munich and encouraged him to illustrate Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Candide&quot;. His resultant drawings were published later in a 1920 version of the book edited by Kurt Wolff. Around this time, Klee&#x27;s graphic work increased. His early inclination towards the absurd and the sarcastic was well received by Kubin, who befriended Klee and became one of his first significant collectors. Klee met, through Kubin, the art critic Wilhelm Hausenstein in 1911. Klee was a foundation member and manager of the Munich artists&#x27; union &quot;Sema&quot; that summer. In autumn he made an acquaintance with August Macke and Wassily Kandinsky, and in winter he joined the editorial team of the almanac &quot;Der Blaue Reiter&quot;, founded by Franz Marc and Kandinsky. On meeting Kandinsky, Klee recorded, &quot;I came to feel a deep trust in him. He is somebody, and has an exceptionally beautiful and lucid mind.&quot; Other members included Macke, Gabriele Münter and Marianne von Werefkin. Klee became in a few months one of the most important and independent members of the &quot;Blaue Reiter&quot;, but he was not yet fully integrated.

The release of the almanac was delayed for the benefit of an exhibition. The first &quot;Blaue Reiter&quot; exhibition took place from 18 December 1911 to 1 January 1912 in the Moderne Galerie Heinrich Thannhauser in Munich. Klee did not attend it, but in the second exhibition, which occurred from 12 February to 18 March 1912 in the Galerie Goltz, 17 of his graphic works were shown. The name of this art exhibition was &quot;Schwarz-Weiß&quot;, as it only regarded graphic painting. Initially planned to be released in 1911, the release date of the &quot;Der Blau Reiter&quot; almanac by Kandinsky and Marc was delayed in May 1912, including the reproduced ink drawing &quot;Steinhauer&quot; by Klee. At the same time, Kandinsky published his art history writing &quot;Über das Geistige in der Kunst&quot;.

===Participation in art exhibitions, 1912–1913===
The association opened Klee&#x27;s mind to modern theories of color. His travels to Paris in 1912 also exposed him to the ferment of Cubism and the pioneering examples of &quot;pure painting&quot;, an early term for abstract art. The use of bold color by Robert Delaunay and Maurice de Vlaminck also inspired him. Rather than copy these artists, Klee began working out his own color experiments in pale watercolors and did some primitive landscapes, including &quot;In the Quarry&quot; (1913) and &quot;Houses near the Gravel Pit&quot; (1913), using blocks of color with limited overlap. Klee acknowledged that &quot;a long struggle lies in store for me in this field of color&quot; in order to reach his &quot;distant noble aim.&quot; Soon, he discovered &quot;the style which connects drawing and the realm of color.&quot;

===Trip to Tunis, 1914===
Klee&#x27;s artistic breakthrough came in 1914 when he briefly visited Tunisia with August Macke and Louis Moilliet and was impressed by the quality of the light there. He wrote, &quot;Color has taken possession of me; no longer do I have to chase after it, I know that it has hold of me forever... Color and I are one. I am a painter.&quot; With that realization, faithfulness to nature faded in importance. Instead, Klee began to delve into the &quot;cool romanticism of abstraction&quot;. In gaining a second artistic vocabulary, Klee added color to his abilities in draftsmanship, and in many works combined them successfully, as he did in one series he called &quot;operatic paintings&quot;. One of the most literal examples of this new synthesis is &quot;The Bavarian Don Giovanni&quot; (1919).

After returning home, Klee painted his first pure abstract, &quot;In the Style of Kairouan&quot; (1914), composed of colored rectangles and a few circles. The colored rectangle became his basic building block, what some scholars associate with a musical note, which Klee combined with other colored blocks to create a color harmony analogous to a musical composition. His selection of a particular color palette emulates a musical key. Sometimes he uses complementary pairs of colors, and other times &quot;dissonant&quot; colors, again reflecting his connection with musicality.

===Military career===

A few weeks later, World War I began. At first, Klee was somewhat detached from it, as he wrote ironically, &quot;I have long had this war in me. That is why, inwardly, it is none of my concern.&quot; Klee was conscripted as a &quot;Landsturmsoldat&quot; (soldier of the reserve forces in Prussia or Imperial Germany) on 5 March 1916. The deaths of his friends August Macke and Franz Marc in battle began to affect him. Venting his distress, he created several pen and ink lithographs on war themes including &quot;Death for the Idea&quot; (1915). After finishing the military training course, which began on 11 March 1916, he was committed as a soldier behind the front. Klee moved on 20 August to the aircraft maintenance company in Oberschleissheim, executing skilled manual work, such as restoring aircraft camouflage, and accompanying aircraft transports. On 17 January 1917, he was transferred to the Royal Bavarian flying school in Gersthofen (which 54 years later became the USASA Field Station Augsburg) to work as a clerk for the treasurer until the end of the war. This allowed him to stay in a small room outside of the barrack block and continue painting.

He continued to paint during the entire war and managed to exhibit in several shows. By 1917, Klee&#x27;s work was selling well and art critics acclaimed him as the best of the new German artists. His &quot;Ab ovo&quot; (1917) is particularly noteworthy for its sophisticated technique. It employs watercolor on gauze and paper with a chalk ground, which produces a rich texture of triangular, circular, and crescent patterns. Demonstrating his range of exploration, mixing color and line, his &quot;Warning of the Ships&quot; (1918) is a colored drawing filled with symbolic images on a field of suppressed color.

== Mature career ==
In 1919 Klee applied for a teaching post at the Academy of Art in Stuttgart, but the attempt failed. After that he managed to secure a three-year contract, with a minimum annual income, with dealer Hans Goltz, whose influential gallery gave Klee major exposure, and some commercial success. A retrospective of over 300 works, in 1920, was also notable.

Klee taught at the Bauhaus from January 1921 to April 1931. He was a &quot;Form&quot; master in the bookbinding, stained glass, and mural painting workshops and was provided with two studios. In 1922, Kandinsky joined the staff and resumed his friendship with Klee. Later that year the first Bauhaus exhibition and festival was held, for which Klee created several of the advertising materials. Klee welcomed the many conflicting theories and opinions within the Bauhaus: &quot;I also approve of these forces competing one with the other if the result is achievement.&quot;

Klee was also a member of Die Blaue Vier (The Blue Four), with Kandinsky, Lyonel Feininger, and Alexej von Jawlensky, which formed in 1923, at the instigation of Galka Scheyer, who subsequently organized exhibitions of their work in the United States. In 1924, Klee had his first exhibits in Paris, and he became a hit with the French Surrealists. Klee visited Egypt in 1928, which impressed him less than Tunisia. In 1929, the first major monograph on Klee&#x27;s work was published, written by Will Grohmann.

Klee also taught at the Düsseldorf Academy from 1931 to 1933, and was singled out by a Nazi newspaper, &quot;Then that great fellow Klee comes onto the scene, already famed as a Bauhaus teacher in Dessau. He tells everyone he&#x27;s a thoroughbred Arab, but he&#x27;s a typical Galician Jew.&quot; His home was searched by the Gestapo and he was fired from his job. His self-portrait &quot;Struck from the List&quot; (1933) commemorates the sad occasion. In 1933–34, Klee had shows in London and Paris, and finally met Pablo Picasso, whom he greatly admired. The Klee family emigrated to Switzerland in late 1933.

Klee was at the peak of his creative output. His &quot;Ad Parnassum&quot; (1932) is considered his masterpiece and the best example of his pointillist style; it is also one of his largest, most finely worked paintings. He produced nearly 500 works in 1933 during his last year in Germany. However, in 1933, Klee began experiencing the symptoms of what was diagnosed as scleroderma after his death. The progression of his fatal disease, which made swallowing very difficult, can be followed through the art he created in his last years. His output in 1936 was only 25 pictures. In the later 1930s, his health recovered somewhat and he was encouraged by a visit from Kandinsky and Picasso. Klee&#x27;s simpler and larger designs enabled him to keep up his output in his final years, and in 1939 he created over 1,200 works, a career high for one year. He used heavier lines and mainly geometric forms with fewer but larger blocks of color. His varied color palettes, some with bright colors and others somber, perhaps reflected his alternating moods of optimism and pessimism. Back in Germany in 1937, seventeen of Klee&#x27;s pictures were included in an exhibition of &quot;Degenerate art&quot; and 102 of his works in public collections were seized by the Nazis.

== Death ==
In 1935, two years after moving to Switzerland and working in a very confined situation, Klee developed scleroderma, an autoimmune disease resulting in hardening of connective tissue.

He endured pain that seems to be reflected in his last works of art. In his last months he created 50 drawings of angels. One of his last paintings, &quot;Death and Fire&quot;, features a skull in the center with the German word for death, &quot;Tod&quot;, appearing in the face. He died in Muralto, Locarno, Switzerland, on 29 June 1940 without having obtained Swiss citizenship, despite his birth in that country. His art work was considered too revolutionary, even degenerate, by the Swiss authorities, but eventually they accepted his request six days after his death. His legacy comprised about 9,000 works of art. The words on his tombstone, Klee&#x27;s credo, placed there by his son Felix, say, &quot;I cannot be grasped in the here and now, for my dwelling place is as much among the dead as the yet unborn. Slightly closer to the heart of creation than usual, but still not close enough.&quot; He was buried at Schosshaldenfriedhof, Bern, Switzerland.

== Style and methods ==

Klee has been variously associated with Expressionism, Cubism, Futurism, Surrealism, and Abstraction, but his pictures are difficult to classify. He generally worked in isolation from his peers, and interpreted new art trends in his own way. He was inventive in his methods and technique. Klee worked in many different media—oil paint, watercolor, ink, pastel, etching, and others. He often combined them into one work. He used canvas, burlap, muslin, linen, gauze, cardboard, metal foils, fabric, wallpaper, and newsprint. Klee employed spray paint, knife application, stamping, glazing, and impasto, and mixed media such as oil with watercolor, watercolor with pen and India ink, and oil with tempera.

He was a natural draftsman, and through long experimentation developed a mastery of color and tonality. Many of his works combine these skills. He uses a great variety of color palettes from nearly monochromatic to highly polychromatic. His works often have a fragile childlike quality to them and are usually on a small scale. He often used geometric forms and grid format compositions as well as letters and numbers, frequently combined with playful figures of animals and people. Some works were completely abstract. Many of his works and their titles reflect his dry humor and varying moods; some express political convictions. They frequently allude to poetry, music and dreams and sometimes include words or musical notation. The later works are distinguished by spidery hieroglyph-like symbols. Rainer Maria Rilke wrote about Klee in 1921, &quot;Even if you hadn&#x27;t told me he plays the violin, I would have guessed that on many occasions his drawings were transcriptions of music.&quot;

Pamela Kort observed: &quot;Klee&#x27;s 1933 drawings present their beholder with an unparalleled opportunity to glimpse a central aspect of his aesthetics that has remained largely unappreciated: his lifelong concern with the possibilities of parody and wit. Herein lies their real significance, particularly for an audience unaware that Klee&#x27;s art has political dimensions.&quot;

Among the few plastic works are hand puppets made between 1916 and 1925, for his son Felix. The artist neither counted them as a component of his oeuvre, nor did he list them in his catalogue raisonné. Thirty of the preserved puppets are stored at the Zentrum Paul Klee, Bern.

==Works==
=== Early works ===
Some of Klee&#x27;s early preserved children&#x27;s drawings, which his grandmother encouraged, were listed on his catalogue raisonné. A total of 19 etchings were produced during the Bern years; ten of these were made between 1903 and 1905 in the cycle &quot;Inventionen&quot; (Inventions), which were presented in June 1906 at the &quot;Internationale Kunstausstellung des Vereins bildender Künstler Münchens &#x27;Secession&#x27;&quot; (International Art Exhibition of the Association for Graphic Arts, Munich, Secession), his first appearance as a painter in the public. Klee had removed the third Invention, &quot;Pessimistische Allegorie des Gebirges&quot; (Pessimistic Allegory of the Mountain), in February 1906 from his cycle. The satirical etchings, for example &quot;Jungfrau im Baum/Jungfrau (träumend)&quot; (Virgin on the tree/Virgin (dreaming)) from 1903 and &quot;Greiser Phoenix&quot; (Aged Phoenix) from 1905, were classified by Klee as &quot;surrealistic outposts&quot;. &quot;Jungfrau im Baum&quot; ties on the motive &quot;Le cattive madri&quot; (1894) by Giovanni Segantini. The picture was influenced by grotesque lyric poetries of Alfred Jarry, Max Jacob and Christian Morgenstern. It features a cultural pessimism, which can be found at the turn of the 20th century in works by Symbolists. The Invention Nr. 6, the 1903 etching &quot;Zwei Männer, einander in höherer Stellung vermutend&quot; (Two Men, Supposing the Other to be in a Higher Position), depicts two naked men, presumably emperor Wilhelm II and Franz Joseph I of Austria, recognizable by their hairstyle and beards. As their clothes and insignia were bereft, &quot;both of them have no clue if their conventional salute […] is in order or not. As they assume that their counterpart could have been higher rated&quot;, they bow and scrape.

Klee began to introduce a new technique in 1905: scratching on a blackened glass panel with a needle. In that manner he created about 57 Verre églomisé pictures, among those the 1905 &quot;Gartenszene&quot; (Scene on a Garden) and the 1906 &quot;Porträt des Vaters&quot; (Portrait of a Father), with which he tried to combine painting and scratching. Klee&#x27;s solitary early work ended in 1911, the year he met and was inspired by the graphic artist Alfred Kubin, and became associated with the artists of the &quot;Blaue Reiter&quot;.

=== Mystical-abstract period, 1914–1919 ===
During his twelve-day educational trip to Tunis in April 1914 Klee produced with Macke and Moilliet watercolor paintings, which implement the strong light and color stimulus of the North African countryside in the fashion of Paul Cézanne and Robert Delaunay&#x27;s cubistic form concepts. The aim was not to imitate nature, but to create compositions analogous to nature&#x27;s formative principle, as in the works &quot;In den Häusern von Saint-Germain&quot; (In the Houses of Saint-Germain) and &quot;Straßencafé&quot; (Streetcafé). Klee conveyed the scenery in a grid, so that it dissolves into colored harmony. He also created abstract works in that period such as &quot;Abstract&quot; and &quot;Farbige Kreise durch Farbbänder verbunden&quot; (Colored Circles Tied Through Inked Ribbons). He never abandoned the object; a permanent segregation never took place. It took over ten years that Klee worked on experiments and analysis of the color, resulting to an independent artificial work, whereby his design ideas were based on the colorful oriental world.

&quot;Föhn im Marc&#x27;schen Garten&quot; (Foehn at Marc&#x27;s Garden) was made after the Turin trip. It indicates the relations between color and the stimulus of Macke and Delaunay. Although elements of the garden are clearly visible, a further steering towards abstraction is noticeable. In his diary Klee wrote the following note at that time:

In the large molding pit are lying ruins, on which one partially hangs. They provide the material for the abstraction. […] The terrible the world, the abstract the art, while a happy world produces secularistic art.

Under the impression of his military service he created the painting &quot;Trauerblumen&quot; (Velvetbells) in 1917, which, with its graphical signs, vegetal and phantastic shapes, is a forerunner of his future works, harmonically combining graphic, color and object. For the first time birds appear in the pictures, such as in &quot;Blumenmythos&quot; (Flower Myth) from 1918, mirroring the flying and falling planes he saw in Gersthofen, and the photographed plane crashes.

In the 1918 watercolor painting &quot;Einst dem Grau der Nacht enttaucht&quot;, a compositional implemented poem, possibly written by Klee, he incorporated letters in small, in terms of color separated squares, cutting off the first verse from the second one with silver paper. At the top of the cardboard, which carries the picture, the verses are inscribed in manuscript form. Here, Klee did not lean on Delaunay&#x27;s colors, but on Marc&#x27;s, although the picture content of both painters does not correspond with each other. Herwarth Walden, Klee&#x27;s art dealer, saw in them a &quot;Wachablösung&quot; (changing of the guard) of his art. Since 1919 he often used oil colors, with which he combined watercolors and colored pencil. The &quot;Villa R&quot; (Kunstmuseum Basel) from 1919 unites visible realities such as sun, moon, mountains, trees and architectures, as well as surreal pledges and sentiment readings.

=== Works in the Bauhaus period and in Düsseldorf ===
His works during this time include &quot;Camel (in rhythmic landscape with trees)&quot; as well as other paintings with abstract graphical elements such as &quot;betroffener Ort&quot; (Affected Place) (1922). From that period he created &quot;Die Zwitscher-Maschine&quot; (The Twittering Machine), which was later removed from the National Gallery. After being named defamatory in the Munich exhibition &quot;Entartete Kunst&quot;, the painting was later bought by the Buchholz Gallery, New York, and then transferred in 1939 to the Museum of Modern Art. The &quot;twittering&quot; in the title refers to the open-beaked birds, while the &quot;machine&quot; is illustrated by the crank. The watercolor painting appears at a first glance childish, but it allows more interpretations. The picture can be interpreted as a critic by Klee, who shows through denaturation of the birds, that the world technization heist the creatures&#x27; self-determination.

Other examples from that period are &quot;der Goldfisch&quot; (The Goldfish) from 1925, &quot;Katze und Vogel&quot; (Cat and Bird), from 1928, and &quot;Hauptweg und Nebenwege&quot; (Main Road and Byways) from 1929. Through variations of the canvas ground and his combined painting techniques Klee created new color effects and picture impressions.

From 1916 to 1925, Klee created 50 hand puppets for his son Felix. The puppets are not mentioned in the Bauhaus catalog of works, since they were intended as private toys from the beginning. Nevertheless, they are an impressive example of Klee&#x27;s imagery. He not only dealt with puppet shows privately, but also in his artistic work at the Bauhaus.

In 1931, Klee transferred to Düsseldorf to teach at the Akademie; the Nazis shut down the Bauhaus soon after. During this time, Klee illustrated a series of guardian angels. Among these figurations is &quot;In Engelshut&quot; (In the Angel&#x27;s Care). Its overlaying technique evinces the polyphonic character of his drawing method between 1920 and 1932.

The 1932 painting &quot;Ad Parnassum&quot; was also created in the Düsseldorf period. This is one of his largest paintings, as he usually worked with small formats. In this mosaic-like work in the style of pointillism he combined different techniques and compositional principles. Influenced by his trip to Egypt from 1928 to 1929, Klee built a color field from individually stamped dots, surrounded by similarly stamped lines, which results in a pyramid. Above the roof of the &quot;Parnassus&quot; there is a sun. The title identifies the picture as the home of Apollo and the Muses. During his 1929 travels through Egypt, Klee developed a sense of connection to the land, described by art historian Olivier Berggruen as a mystical feeling: &quot;In the desert, the sun&#x27;s intense rays seemed to envelop all living things, and at night, the movement of the stars felt even more palpable. In the architecture of the ancient funerary moments Klee discovered a sense of proportion and measure in which human beings appeared to establish a convincing relationship with the immensity of the landscape; furthermore, he was drawn to the esoteric numerology that governed the way in which these monuments had been built.&quot; In 1933, his last year in Germany, he created a range of paintings and drawings; the catalogue raisonné comprised 482 works. The self-portrait in the same year—with the programmatic title &quot;von der Liste gestrichen&quot; (removed from the list)—provides information about his feeling after losing his professorship. The abstract portrait was painted in dark colors and shows closed eyes and compressed lips, while on the back of his head there is a large &quot;X&quot;, symbolizing that his art was no longer valued in Germany.

=== Last works in Switzerland ===
In this period Klee mainly worked on large-sized pictures. After the onset of illness, there were about 25 works in the 1936 catalogue, but his productivity increased in 1937 to 264 pictures, 1938 to 489, and 1939—his most productive year—to 1254. They dealt with ambivalent themes, expressing his personal fate, the political situation and his wit. Examples are the watercolor painting &quot;Musiker&quot; (musician), a stick-man face with partially serious, partially smiling mouth; and the &quot;Revolution des Viadukts&quot; (Revolution of the Viadukt), an anti-fascist art. In &quot;Viadukt&quot; (1937) the bridge arches split from the bank as they refuse to be linked to a chain and are therefore rioting.
Since 1938, Klee worked more intensively with hieroglyphic-like elements. The painting &quot;Insula dulcamara&quot; from the same year, which is one of his largest (), shows a white face in the middle of the elements, symbolizing death with its black-circled eye sockets. Bitterness and sorrow are not rare in much of his works during this time.

Klee created in 1940 a picture which strongly differs from the previous works, leaving it unsigned on the scaffold. The comparatively realistic still life, &quot;Ohne Titel&quot;, later named as &quot;Der Todesengel&quot; (Angel of Death), depicts flowers, a green pot, sculpture and an angel. The moon on black ground is separated from these groups. During his 60th birthday Klee was photographed in front of this picture.

== Reception and legacy==
=== Contemporary view===

&quot;Klee&#x27;s act is very prestigious. In a minimum of one line he can reveal his wisdom. He is everything; profound, gentle and many more of the good things, and this because: he is innovative&quot;, wrote Oskar Schlemmer, Klee&#x27;s future artist colleague at the Bauhaus, in his September 1916 diary.

Novelist and Klee&#x27;s friend Wilhelm Hausenstein wrote in his work &quot;Über Expressionismus in der Malerei&quot; (On Expressionism in Painting), &quot;Maybe Klee&#x27;s attitude is in general understandable for musical people—how Klee is one of the most delightsome violinist playing Bach and Händel, who ever walked on earth. […] For Klee, the German classic painter of the Cubism, the world music became his companion, possibly even a part of his art; the composition, written in notes, seems to be not dissimilar.&quot;

When Klee visited the Paris surrealism exhibition in 1925, Max Ernst was impressed by his work. His partially morbid motifs appealed to the surrealists. André Breton helped to develop the surrealism and renamed Klee&#x27;s 1912 painting &quot;Zimmerperspektive mit Einwohnern&quot; (Room Perspective with People) to &quot;chambre spirit&quot; in a catalogue. Critic René Crevel called the artist a &quot;dreamer&quot; who &quot;releases a swarm of small lyrical louses from mysterious abysses.&quot; Paul Klee&#x27;s confidante Will Grohmann argued in the &quot;Cahiers d&#x27;art&quot; that he &quot;stands definitely well solid on his feet. He is by no means a dreamer; he is a modern person, who teaches as a professor at the Bauhaus.&quot; Whereupon Breton, as Joan Miró remembers, was critical of Klee: &quot;Masson and I have both discovered Paul Klee. Paul Éluard and Crevel are also interested in Klee, and they have even visited him. But Breton despises him.&quot;

The art of mentally ill people inspired Klee as well as Kandinsky and Max Ernst, after Hans Prinzhorns book &quot;Bildnerei der Geisteskranken&quot; (Artistry of the Mentally Ill) was published in 1922. In 1937, some papers from Prinzhorn&#x27;s anthology were presented at the National Socialist propaganda exhibition &quot;Entartete Kunst&quot; in Munich, with the purpose of defaming the works of Kirchner, Klee, Nolde and other artists by likening them to the works of the insane.

In 1949 Marcel Duchamp commented on Paul Klee: &quot;The first reaction in front of a Klee painting is the very pleasant discovery, what everyone of us could or could have done, to try drawing like in our childhood. Most of his compositions show at the first glance a plain, naive expression, found in children&#x27;s drawings. […] At a second analyse one can discover a technique, which takes as a basis a large maturity in thinking. A deep understanding of dealing with watercolors to paint a personal method in oil, structured in decorative shapes, let Klee stand out in the contemporary art and make him incomparable. On the other side, his experiment was adopted in the last 30 years by many other artists as a basis for newer creations in the most different areas in painting. His extreme productivity never shows evidence of repetition, as is usually the case. He had so much to say, that a Klee never became another Klee.&quot;

One of Klee&#x27;s paintings, &quot;Angelus Novus&quot;, was the object of an interpretative text by German philosopher and literary critic Walter Benjamin, who purchased the painting in 1921. In his &quot;Theses on the Philosophy of History&quot; Benjamin suggests that the angel depicted in the painting might be seen as representing the angel of history.

Another aspect of his legacy, and one demonstrating his multi-faceted presence in the modern artistic imagination, is his appeal for those interested in the history of the algorithm as exemplified by &quot;Homage to Paul Klee&quot; by computer art pioneer Frieder Nake.

=== Musical interpretations ===
Unlike his taste for adventurous modern experiment in painting, Klee, though musically talented, was attracted to older traditions of music; he appreciated neither composers of the late 19th century, such as Wagner, Bruckner and Mahler, nor contemporary music. Bach and Mozart were for him the greatest composers; he most enjoyed playing the works by the latter.

Klee&#x27;s work has influenced composers such as Argentinian Roberto García Morillo in 1943, with &quot;Tres pinturas de Paul Klee&quot;. Others include the American composer David Diamond in 1958, with the four-part Opus &quot;Welt von Paul Klee&quot; (World of Paul Klee). Gunther Schuller composed &quot;Seven Studies on Themes of Paul Klee&quot; in the years 1959/60, consisting of &quot;Antique Harmonies&quot;, &quot;Abstract Trio&quot;, &quot;Little Blue Devil&quot;, &quot;Twittering Machine&quot;, &quot;Arab Village&quot;, &quot;An Eerie Moment&quot;, and &quot;Pastorale&quot;. The Spanish composer Benet Casablancas wrote &quot;Alter Klang&quot;, Impromptu for Orchestra after Klee (2006); Casablancas is author also of the &quot;Retablo on texts by Paul Klee&quot;, Cantata da Camera for Soprano, Mezzo and Piano (2007). In 1950, Giselher Klebe performed his orchestral work &quot;Die Zwitschermaschine&quot; with the subtitle &quot;Metamorphosen über das Bild von Paul Klee&quot; at the Donaueschinger Musiktage. &quot;8 Pieces on Paul Klee&quot; is the title of the debut album by the Ensemble Sortisatio, recorded February and March 2002 in Leipzig and August 2002 in Lucerne, Switzerland. The composition &quot;Wie der Klee vierblättrig wurde&quot; (How the clover became four-leaved) was inspired by the watercolor painting &quot;Hat Kopf, Hand, Fuss und Herz&quot; (1930), &quot;Angelus Novus&quot; and &quot;Hauptweg und Nebenwege&quot;.

In 1968, a jazz group called The National Gallery featuring composer Chuck Mangione released the album &quot;Performing Musical Interpretations of the Paintings of Paul Klee&quot;. In 1995 the Greek experimental filmmaker, Kostas Sfikas, created a film based entirely on Paul Klee&#x27;s paintings. The film is entitled &quot;Paul Klee&#x27;s Prophetic Bird of Sorrows&quot;, and draws its title from Klee&#x27;s Landscape with Yellow Birds. It was made using portions and cutouts from Paul Klee&#x27;s paintings.

===Architectural honors===
Since 1995, the &quot;Paul Klee-Archiv&quot; (Paul Klee archive) of the University of Jena houses an extensive collection of works by Klee. It is located within the art history department, established by Franz-Joachim Verspohl. It encompasses the private library of book collector Rolf Sauerwein which contains nearly 700 works from 30 years composed of monographs about Klee, exhibition catalogues, extensive secondary literature as well as originally illustrated issues, a postcard and a signed photography portrait of Klee.

Architect Renzo Piano constructed the Zentrum Paul Klee in June 2005. Located in Bern, the museum exhibits about 150 (of 4000 Klee works overall) in a six-month rotation, as it is impossible to show all of his works at once. Furthermore, his pictures require rest periods; they contain relatively photosensitive colors, inks and papers, which may bleach, change, turn brown and become brittle if exposed to light for too long. The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art has a comprehensive Klee collection, donated by Carl Djerassi. Other exhibitions include the Sammlung Rosengart in Luzern, the Albertina in Wien and the Berggruen Museum in Berlin. Schools in Gersthofen, Lübeck; Klein-Winternheim, Overath; his place of birth Münchenbuchsee and Düsseldorf bear his name.

=== Nazi looting and restitutions ===
In addition to Klee&#x27;s works that Nazis seized from museums, several of his artworks were looted by Nazis from Jewish collectors and their families. Some of these have been restituted while others have been the subject of lawsuits and claims for restitution. One of the most famous claims was for Klee&#x27;s &quot;Swamp Legend&quot;.

=== Journal ===
The Zwitscher-Maschine. Journal on Paul Klee (ISSN 2297-6809 ) is a publication dedicated to international studies on Paul Klee. It encompasses art historical and art technological studies, as well as literary or philosophical texts on the life and work of Paul Klee. The journal is freely accessible to authors from the international Klee research community, following an open-access approach known as the &#x27;golden road&#x27; primary publishing strategy.

==Notes and references==
===Notes===
* Paul Klee&#x27;s father was a German citizen; his mother was Swiss. Swiss law determined citizenship along paternal lines, and thus Paul inherited his father&#x27;s German citizenship. He served in the German army during World War I. Klee grew up in Berne, Switzerland, and returned there often, even before his final emigration from Germany in 1933. He died before his application for Swiss citizenship was processed.
* German: Werftkompanie, lit. &#x27;shipyard company&#x27;.

<doc id="80442" wikidata="Q351518" url="?curid=80442" title="Simplicius of Cilicia">
<text>Simplicius of Cilicia (; ; – c. 540) was a disciple of Ammonius Hermiae and Damascius, and was one of the last of the Neoplatonists. He was among the pagan philosophers persecuted by Justinian in the early 6th century, and was forced for a time to seek refuge in the Persian court, before being allowed back into the empire. He wrote extensively on the works of Aristotle. Although his writings are all commentaries on Aristotle and other authors, rather than original compositions, his intelligent and prodigious learning makes him the last great philosopher of pagan antiquity. His works have preserved much information about earlier philosophers which would have otherwise been lost.

==Life==
Little is known about Simplicius&#x27; life. Based on his education, it&#x27;s likely he was born some time around 480. His commentary on Aristotle&#x27;s On the Heavens can be definitively dated to 538, which is the latest known definitive evidence for his life, making it likely he died some time around 540. An older source dates his life to c. 490 – c. 560.

Simplicius was a disciple of Ammonius Hermiae, and Damascius, and was consequently one of the last members of the Neoplatonist school. The school had its headquarters in Athens. It became the centre of the last efforts to maintain Hellenistic religion against the encroachments of Christianity. Imperial edicts enacted in the 5th century against paganism gave legal protection to pagans against personal maltreatment. We know little about where Simplicius lived and taught. That he not only wrote, but taught, is proved by the address to his hearers in the commentary on the &quot;Physica Auscultatio&quot; of Aristotle, as well as by the title of his commentary on the &quot;Categories&quot;. He had received his training partly in Alexandria, under Ammonius, partly in Athens, as a disciple of Damascius; and it was probably in one of these two cities that he subsequently took up his abode; for, with the exception of these cities and Constantinople, it would have been difficult to find a town which possessed the collections of books he needed, and he is unlikely to have gone to Constantinople. One claim at least asserts that Simplicius went to Harran, in what is modern-day south-eastern Turkey.
In the year 528 the emperor Justinian ordered that pagans should be removed from government posts. Some were robbed of their property, some put to death. The order specified that if they did not within three months convert to Christianity, they were to be banished from the Empire. In addition, it was forbidden any longer to teach philosophy and jurisprudence in Athens. Probably also the property of the Platonist school, which in the time of Proclus was valued at more than 1000 gold pieces, was confiscated; at least, Justinian deprived the physicians and teachers of the liberal arts of the provision-money which had been assigned to them by previous emperors, and confiscated funds which the citizens had provided for spectacles and other civic purposes. Seven philosophers, among whom were Simplicius, Eulamius, Priscian, and others, with Damascius, the last president of the Platonist school in Athens at their head, resolved to seek protection at the court of the famous Persian king Chosroes, who had succeeded to the throne in 531. But they were disappointed in their hopes. Chosroes, in a peace treaty concluded with Justinian c. 533 stipulated that the philosophers should be allowed to return without risk and to practise their rites, after which they returned. Of the subsequent fortunes of the seven philosophers we learn nothing. As to his personal history, especially his migration to Persia, no definite allusions are to be found in the writings of Simplicius. Only at the end of his explanation of the treatise of Epictetus, Simplicius mentions, with gratitude, the consolation which he had found under tyrannical oppression in such ethical contemplations; which might suggest that it was composed during, or immediately after, the above-mentioned persecutions.

==Philosophy==
One of Simplicius&#x27; main concerns was the harmonization of Platonic and Aristotelian philosophy. Simplicius, as a Neoplatonist, endeavoured to show that Aristotle agrees with Plato even on those points which he controverts, so that he may lead the way to their deeper, hidden meaning. This systematic exposition was part of the widespread effort in late antique Neoplatonism to present the most well-known authorities of the classical pagan tradition as representatives of one and the same venerable doctrine, which was intended to present it as a superior alternative to Christianity, and to refute the Christian argument that because the pagan thinkers differ among themselves, they therefore do not possess the truth. Simplicius argued that Aristotle&#x27;s objections to Plato&#x27;s teachings did not concern the factual core, but only differed in certain formulations. Simplicius explained his approach on the occasion of his examination of the philosophy of time, arguing that it is not important to know Aristotle&#x27;s view of this problem; rather, one must first recognize what time actually is. Then, starting from there, one could get closer to Aristotle&#x27;s insights. In other respects, too, he postulated a fundamental agreement between the core ideas of the important philosophical teachers and directions, insofar as they seemed to be compatible with the Neoplatonic world view. When in doubt, he opted for a harmonizing interpretation. Where this was not possible, he took a clear position, such as with his rejection of the materialism of the Stoics.

In his view not only Plotinus, but also Syrianus, Proclus, and Ammonius, are great philosophers, who have penetrated into the depths of the wisdom of Plato. Many of the more ancient Greek philosophers he also brings into a connection with Platonism. He is, however, distinguished from his predecessors, whom he so admires, in making less frequent application of Orphic, Hermetic, Chaldean, and other &quot;Theologumena&quot; of the East; partly in proceeding carefully and modestly in the explanation and criticism of particular points, and in striving with diligence to draw from the original sources a thorough knowledge of the older Greek philosophy. Although averse to Christianity he abstains from assailing Christian doctrines, even when he combats expressly the work of his contemporary, John Philoponus, directed against the Aristotelian doctrine of the eternity of the universe. In Ethics he seems to have abandoned the mystical pantheistic purification-theory of the Neoplatonists, and to have found full satisfaction in the ethical system of the later Stoics, however little he was disposed towards their logical and physical doctrines.

=== Astronomy ===
Aristotle had already taken the view that mathematics, as a superordinate science, was allowed to provide axioms to a subordinate science such as astronomy and was responsible for the justification and explanation of astronomical phenomena; the superordinate science knows the causes, the subordinate only the facts. Following this principle, Aristotle used geometric definitions and insights for his cosmological explanations. Philoponus turned against his method of argumentation, believing that a mathematical argument related to physics could be invalidated by pointing to the nature of physical reality, which so limited the mathematical possibility that the argument lost its basis. Thus, mathematical principles are not fully applicable in the physical world. This view met with vehement criticism from Simplicius, who called for an unimpeded transition from physics to its mathematical principles and, conversely, an unrestricted application of mathematical principles to physics, and especially to astronomy. He considered deductive reasoning to be more important than gaining insights through induction. Accordingly, he presented Aristotelian cosmology as a strictly deductive system.

In astronomy, Simplicius, like Aristotle, presupposed the geocentrism that was prevalent in antiquity that the Earth was at rest in the center of the universe. With regard to the movements of the stars, however, he deviated from the Aristotelian model, which envisages transparent, uniformly rotating hollow balls (spheres) arranged concentrically around the center of the world, to which the stars are attached, keeping the celestial bodies in their constant orbits. Simplicius thought that this concept was partly superseded by the later astronomical findings presented by Ptolemy. But he did not consider Ptolemy&#x27;s model to be the final solution either. He was of the opinion that none of the previous theories offered a satisfactory account and explanation of the planetary motions, none was necessarily and demonstrably correct. His own theory also failed to meet his criteria for scientific proof. In contrast to Aristotle, he assumed an axial rotation of all celestial bodies and did not consider their circular movements to be homocentric. According to his idea, only the sphere of the fixed stars revolves around the center of the universe; the planets, which in ancient times also included the Sun and the Moon, perform a more complex motion that involves at least one circular motion that is not centered on the Earth.

Following on from Aristotle, Simplicius distinguished between the approaches of two types of natural scientists: the &quot;physicist&quot; &quot;(physicós),&quot; by which he meant a natural philosopher, and the &quot;mathematician&quot;, i.e. a non-philosopher, who tries to grasp physical conditions with mathematical means. A special case of such a “mathematician” is the astronomer. Both types of researchers study the same subject, but in different ways. The &quot;physicist&quot; inquires into the nature of the celestial spheres and heavenly bodies, he considers them from a qualitative point of view, while the astronomer deals with quantitative points of view, relying on arithmetic and geometrical reasoning. The &quot;physicist&quot; asks about causal connections, the astronomer limits himself to a description that is intended to do justice to the observed phenomena without explaining them causally. Simplicius considered the natural-philosophical, &quot;physical&quot; approach to be the only scientifically profitable one. He believed that astronomers should not be satisfied with devising &quot;hypotheses&quot; – mere rules of calculation – but should use a physical theory well founded by causal argumentation as the starting point for their considerations. Only such a well-founded astronomy can provide real insights. It must be able to explain all observed phenomena, including apparent variations in the size of celestial bodies.

=== Ontology ===
Aristotle said the universe is not located in one particular place. It cannot be localized, because outside of the spherical sky, which is surrounded and delimited by nothing, there is no reality. Simplicius disagreed with this view. He argued that, according to Aristotelian teaching, the circular motion of the celestial sphere was a local motion, that is, a change of place, and that this implied that the heavens were in one place. Simplicius saw the reason for Aristotle&#x27;s error in the inadequacy of the Aristotelian definition of the term &quot;place&quot;. Aristotle had defined place as the boundary between an enclosure and an enclosed. In doing so, he defined it as a two-dimensional surface. Accordingly, the uninhabited heaven could have no place. Simplicius asked whether “enclosure” meant enveloping from the outside or penetrating what was contained. Both lead to a contradiction: if the enclosure penetrates the enclosed, the place is not the limit; if the place only encloses what is contained, it is only the surface of what is contained and not the latter itself in a place, which is absurd. 

Simplicius opposed Aristotle&#x27;s concept with his own understanding of place, that place is a space (χώρα, &quot;chṓra&quot;) and a &quot;vessel&quot; (ὑποδοχή, &quot;hypodochḗ&quot;), or an expanded reality affecting all parts of a thing in place. It is not a hollow space and also not – as Proclus thought – an immaterial body, but material and extended. The matter of the place is not the same as that of the body that is in place; rather, they are two different kinds of matter. There is no inconsistency in this, because from Simplicius&#x27; point of view nothing stands in the way of a mutual penetration of two matters. Place is not an accident, a property of something (such as spatial extension, which a thing has as one of its properties and which is described in the category under quantity). Rather, it is itself an extended ousia (&quot;beingness&quot;, often translated as &quot;substance&quot;). It plays an important role in the world order, for it is the measure that assigns each body its place and within the bodies its parts. Thus, place is not a neutral space in which objects happen to be located, but is the principle of the ordered structure of the entire cosmos and each individual thing. Place does not passively absorb things, but powerfully shapes the relationships between them.

=== Eternity of the world ===
Like Aristotle, Simplicius believed that the spatial extent of the universe was finite. He defended the Aristotelian doctrine of the eternity and indestructibility of the cosmos against the position of John Philoponus, who, as a Christian, accepted creation as the temporal beginning and a future end of the world and justified his view philosophically. One of Philoponus&#x27; arguments was that if the world has no beginning in time, an infinite number of days must already have passed. But if the number of days that make up the past is infinite, the present day could never have been reached, for that would have ended a succession of infinitely many days. On the other hand, Simplicius argued that the past years, since they belonged to the past, no longer existed; it is therefore not a matter of traversing a set of infinitely many real – not just potential – existing units, which Aristotle ruled out. Within the framework of the Aristotelian system, which only allows potential infinity, Philoponus&#x27; argument is compelling from today&#x27;s perspective. However, the question remains open as to whether the possibility of an infinite past is logically excluded even outside of Aristotelian understanding of infinity. This is still a matter of controversy.

=== Cosmology ===
The Neoplatonists were resolute representatives of a monistic world view. They were convinced that there was only one basic principle, &quot;the one&quot;, which was to be regarded as the sole origin of all beings and The Form of the Good. They therefore opposed dualism, which assumes an independent principle of evil as the antithesis of good and the cause of evil, and thus disputes the unity of reality. Simplicius also took a stand on this problem and defended Neoplatonic monism against Manichaeism, a religious doctrine that had been widespread since the 3rd century and offered a decidedly dualistic explanation of the bad. He had personal contact with a Manichaean who gave him information about his faith. According to Manichaean absolute dualism, there is a kingdom of good and a kingdom of Evil. These have always faced each other as irreconcilable adversaries and are in constant struggle. Simplicius attacked the Cosmogony of the Manichaeans, their doctrine of the origin of the cosmos, according to which the creation of the world is part of this conflict. As part of his efforts to refute them, he accused them of not being true myths but monstrosities. In addition, they did not understand that mythical representations are not true in the literal sense, but are to be interpreted symbolically.

Following the traditional belief of the Neoplatonists, Simplicius assigned no real reality to what is bad &quot;(kakón)&quot;. It is only a &quot;deprivation&quot;, a deprivation of the good. There is no “nature of evil”. In reality, everything bad can be explained as a lack of good. Simplicius opposed the Manichaean dualism with the Platonic conviction, shared by Aristotle, that all striving is aimed at something really or supposedly good. No one willingly wants something bad as such. According to this understanding, when one strives for an apparent good and acquires an evil along with it, one arrives at something bad and harmful because one either does not recognize its badness or accepts it for the sake of the good goal. Thus, every action that leads to something bad as a result can be explained by the fact that the person doing the action wanted to achieve something good and useful, but went astray and missed what was actually intended. Wrong decisions and wickedness in a person are therefore only the result of a lack of insight, not of an evil nature in him. Even if there were something inherently bad, it would act for its own benefit, that is, for something good. This is even presupposed in the world view of the Manichaeans, as Simplicius reproached them: According to their myth, the kingdom of evil strives in the fight against good to gain some benefit from it; so, according to Simplicius, it actually wants something good, although it is said to be absolutely bad. Thus, absolute evil seeks that which is contrary to its own nature. This assumption was absurd for Simplicius.

From the point of view of Simplicius, the error of the Manichaeans also goes back to a legitimate concern: They raised the bad to an independent principle so that they didn&#x27;t have to trace it back to God. So they wanted to avoid attributing the cause of evil to the absolutely good deity. In doing so, however, they “fell into the fire while fleeing the smoke”; the apparent way out has become their undoing, because they have taken up a nonsensical position. According to them, good has voluntarily exposed itself to the influence of the opposing power in battle and has suffered losses in the process. This is absurd according to Simplicius&#x27; argument: if the good were to behave in this way, it would be unreasonable and incapable and therefore bad. A truly absolute good cannot enter into a fight at all; it is beyond the reach of anything bad. The Manichaean idea of a struggle between two original principles presupposes that one principle attacks the other, that is, penetrates into its area. But this is impossible with principles which are by their very nature absolutely opposed to each other, for in contact with the other one would either have to change its nature or be annihilated. Both are excluded by definition. Moreover, Simplicius accused the Manichaeans of taking away from man the realm of what fell within his competence because it relieved him of the responsibility for his ethical decisions and oaths. If an eternal, powerful principle of evil is the cause of evil, then it is also the cause of human error. A person&#x27;s bad actions can then no longer be traced back to himself, because in this case he is exposed to an overpowering influence and his self-determination is revoked. 

=== Psychology ===
In Simplicius&#x27; or doctrine of the soul (psyche), he distinguished three types of souls:
* the &quot;first&quot; souls whose abodes are above the lunar sphere in the realm of imperishable bodies. They never descend to earth and know no evil. Since they follow their own nature unhindered, they are exclusively focused on the imperishable good. Therefore, they cannot make wrong decisions. There are no impulses in them that relate to material and transitory things.
* the souls that come from the world of the immortal, but descend to earth and inhabit human bodies there. They occupy an intermediate position between the divine world of pure being and the animal and vegetable world of pure becoming, and have access to both realms. Through their descent, they come into contact with the bad. Losing their exclusive focus on good, they must figure out what is good for them and make decisions prone to error. This can result in them receiving a disposition contrary to their good nature. However, they are able to turn to the good through spiritual effort and thus to realize what is natural for them. Ascending to their homeland beyond the lunar sphere, they are freed from all evils.
* the souls of animals and plants that only know their earthly habitat. In their activities they are always directed towards the physical to which they are related. Since animals lack reason, they are at the mercy of their unreasonable desires. But that&#x27;s not bad for them, it&#x27;s natural for them. They follow the urge to preserve life; so they too have something good as their goal. Their way of experiencing evil is graded: in lower animals it is a purely bodily experience, similar to plants; in some higher animals the experience of evils approaches that of man.

The interest that Simplicius brought to the theory of the soul and the question of what was bad was – as with all Neoplatonists – practical. He was concerned with the utilization of the knowledge gained from understanding the soul for application to an ethical lifestyle. According to Simplicius&#x27; understanding, man is never helplessly at the mercy of evil; he can always choose the good that corresponds to his natural disposition. Moreover, the area in which bad actually occurs is narrowly limited. Impairments affecting the body do not count as bad in the strict sense, and the presence or absence of material goods is immaterial. Processes of material decay are just as necessary as processes of emergence and make sense within the framework of the world order. The interplay of composition and dissolution of bodies is not in itself a bad thing; if you look at it from a higher perspective and see the whole, it becomes necessary. The only really bad things are bad mental attitudes, because what matters is the immortal soul, not the mortal body. Thus genuine evil does not exist in the nature surrounding man, nor in his circumstances, but only in his soul, and there it can be eliminated through knowledge and a philosophical way of life. In addition, physical imperfections are also limited to a relatively small part of the cosmos. They only occur in the earthly realm, for it is only there that the processes of arising, changing, and passing away take place that allow physical deficiencies to occur. According to the world view of the pagan philosophers of the time, Simplicius believed that becoming and passing away only take place in the &quot;sublunar&quot; space – below the moon. He regarded the entire sky above the lunar sphere as a perfect region, to which everything bad was alien.

==Writings==

His surviving works are commentaries on Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;On the Heavens&quot;, &quot;Physics&quot;, and &quot;Categories&quot;, as well as a commentary upon the &quot;Enchiridion of Epictetus&quot;. There is also a commentary on Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;On the Soul&quot; that has been transmitted under his name, but many scholars consider it to be stylistically inferior and lacking in the breadth of historical information usually used by Simplicius, suggesting that it was written by Priscian of Lydia, However, other scholars have defended it as an authentic work of Simplicius.

The &quot;On the Heavens&quot; commentary was written before that on the &quot;Physics&quot;, and probably not in Alexandria, since he mentions in it an astronomical observation made during his stay in that city by Ammonius. Simplicius wrote his commentary on the &quot;Physics&quot; after the death of Damascius, and therefore after his return from Persia. When it was that he wrote his explanations of the &quot;Categories&quot;, whether before or after those on the above-mentioned Aristotelian treatises, it is impossible to ascertain. Besides these commentaries of Simplicius which have been preserved, the &quot;On the Soul&quot; commentary mentions explanations on the metaphysical books, and an epitome of the &quot;Physics&quot; of Theophrastus.

===&quot;Commentary on the Enchridion of Epictetus&quot;===
The distinction between &quot;what is up to us&quot; &quot;(ta eph&#x27; hēmín),&quot; and everything else was the basis of Epictetus&#x27;s ethical program. According to Simplicius, the goal of the &quot;Enchiridion&quot; is to make the soul so free that it will fear nothing, let nothing make it, and be overwhelmed by nothing beneath it. In this way it reaches the natural state that is intended for it within the framework of the world order. In this sense, Simiplicus stated at the beginning of his Epictetus commentary that the &quot;Enchiridion&quot; is aimed at readers who not only want to take note of the content, but are also willing to be moved by the words and who will implement the advice in their lives. For Simplicius, this goal was also the guiding principle of his own work as a commentator. He wanted to bring Epictetus&#x27;s stoic guide to a philosophical life closer to his readers who were influenced by the Platonic-Aristotelian way of thinking. In doing so, he attached particular importance to offering reasons and to making the meaning and use of Epictetus&#x27;s rules and admonitions understandable. Epictetus demanded full concentration on one&#x27;s own area of responsibility, which is essential and which must be recognized at all times. Simplicius saw his task as a commentator as helping the reader to better understand what &quot;is up to us,&quot; and placed great emphasis on the distinction between what is within our power and responsibility and what is beyond his control. In his commentary, Simplicius was concerned with the matters about which the soul can make free decisions, which he considered the primary determinant of whether a good life is good and a bad life is bad. When the soul acts according to its own nature, it is free and able to make a self-determined and beneficial choice. The soul then decides according to a criterion that lies within itself and corresponds to its good nature. In contrast to inanimate bodies, the soul moves itself, and is therefore the cause of its own movements and activities. Therefore, in its own strength it can turn to the one and good that is its source and then act accordingly. This requires that it makes itself independent of the movements that are initiated from outside. But even opinions and activities of the soul that are stimulated or influenced from outside are not to be regarded as something alien, but as something of one&#x27;s own, because it is the soul itself that has made what comes from outside its own; it is then their own movement. All of the soul&#x27;s impulses come from within itself, as opposed to external influences. Simplicius addressed objections that may be raised against this concept. He grappled with deterministic and fatalistic ideas according to which “what is up to us” does not exist at all because human action is determined by coincidences or necessities and not by free will.

Following Epictetus&#x27;s advice to pursue the goal uncompromisingly, Simplicius said that one should approach it seriously and not casually. Epictetus&#x27;s view was that in practicing a reasonable, virtuous attitude, a moderate approach was not advisable for beginners. Rather, a student of philosophy should radically turn away from his previous questionable habits in order to concentrate fully on his goal. You should start with small things, but be consistent. Aristotle had already recommended that undesirable character traits should first be dealt with harshly; later, when the student has gained insight and developed his character well, he can soften the initial severity without becoming a victim of temptation. Although Simplicius agreed in principle to these considerations, he distanced himself from the demands of radical stoicism, which he considered unrealistic. He stated that no human being could completely eliminate his desires. He considered it harmful to proceed too quickly. According to his teaching, irrational strivings should not be suppressed or even destroyed. Rather, all that matters is that they submit to the rule of reason and thus take their proper place. Here Simplicius applied Plato&#x27;s metaphor of the &quot;inner child&quot; The &quot;child&quot; in the adult stands for the irrational that makes itself felt in the life of the soul. It is at the mercy of unreasonable impulses, strives unbridled for sensual pleasure and develops unnecessary fear due to false ideas. According to Platonic understanding, this child should not be killed, but taught and trained. Simplicius found that education &quot;(Paideia)&quot; is mainly &quot;the improvement of the child in us by the educator in us.&quot;

==Legacy==
His commentaries can be regarded as the richest in their contents of any that have come down to us concerning Aristotle. But for them, we should be without the most important fragments of the writings of the Eleatics, of Empedocles, Anaxagoras, Diogenes of Apollonia, and others, which were at that time already very scarce, as well as without many extracts from the lost books of Aristotle, Theophrastus and Eudemus: but for them we should hardly be able to unriddle the doctrine of the Categories, so important for the system of the Stoics. It is true he himself complains that in his time both the school and the writings of the followers of Zeno had perished. But where he cannot draw immediately from the original sources, he looks round for guides whom he can depend upon, who had made use of those sources. 

In addition, we have to thank him for such copious quotations from the Greek commentaries from the time of Andronicus of Rhodes down to Ammonius and Damascius, that, for the Categories and the Physics, the outlines of a history of the interpretation and criticism of those books may be composed. With a correct idea of their importance, Simplicius made the most diligent use of the commentaries of Alexander of Aphrodisias and Porphyry; and although he often enough combats the views of the former, he knew how to value, as it deserved, his (in the main) sound critical sense. He has also preserved for us intelligence of several more ancient readings, which now, in part, have vanished from the manuscripts without leaving any trace, and in the paraphrastic sections of his interpretations furnishes us with valuable contributions for correcting or settling the text of Aristotle. Not less valuable are the contributions towards a knowledge of the ancient astronomical systems for which we have to thank him in his commentary on the books &quot;De Caelo&quot;. We even find in his writings some traces of a disposition for the observation of nature.

While some sources mistakenly attribute the coining of the phrase πάντα ῥεῖ (&quot;panta rhei&quot;), meaning &quot;everything flows/is in a state of flux&quot;, to Simplicius, the phrase is first found in this form in the philosophy of Heraclitus. Later on, it can be found in Simplicius&#x27; commentary on Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Physica&quot; 1313.11. Variations of it, was current in both Plato and Aristotle&#x27;s writings.

Simplicius was presented as an Aristotelian named &quot;Simplicio&quot; by Galileo in his &quot;Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems&quot;.

=== Middle Ages ===
==== Arabic speaking countries ====
In Arabic-speaking countries, Simplikios was known as &quot;Sinbilīqiyūs&quot;. At least the commentaries on the &quot;Categories&quot; and on the first book of the &quot;Elements&quot; of Euclid have been translated into Arabic; in 987 the scholar Ibn an-Nadīm cited them in his &quot;Kitāb al-Fihrist&quot;. He mentioned the name of Simplicius among mathematicians and astronomers, but also attributed to him a commentary on &quot;De Anima&quot;, which had been translated into Classical Syriac and also existed in Arabic. The Persian mathematician al-Nayrizi, active in Baghdad in the late 9th century, had extensively quoted the Euclid commentary in his own commentary on the &quot;Elements&quot;. The writer Ibn al-Qiftī (1172–1248), who dealt with Simplicius in his manual on the history of science, relied on the statements made by Ibn an-Nadīm. He also described him as a mathematician and also claimed that he was respected and had successors who were named after him, so there was a school of Simplicius. The philosopher al-Fārābī, who died in 950 and was a zealous user of ancient thought, apparently used the &quot;Categories&quot; commentary without ever naming the author. He shared the harmonizing view of Simplicius. Averroes, (1126–1198), in whose works numerous correspondences with texts by Simplicius can be found, never mentioned the Neoplatonist. He was so familiar with his argument against Philoponus that one researcher suggests that he had access to material from the &quot;Physics&quot; commentary.

==== Western and Central Europe ====
In the 12th century Gerhard of Cremona translated the Euclid commentary of an-Nayrīzīs into Latin. As a result, the Simplicius quotations contained therein became known in the West. Gerhard rendered the philosopher&#x27;s name as &quot;Sambelichius&quot;. Around the middle 13th century, Albert Magnus used Gerhard&#x27;s translation for his own Euclid Commentary, also adopting material from Simplicius.

The Latin-speaking Late Medieval scholars of Western and Central Europe only had two writings by Simplicius: the commentaries on the &quot;Categories&quot; and on &quot;On the Heavens,&quot; which William of Moerbeke had translated into Latin. Moerbeke finished the translation of the &quot;Categories&quot; commentary in March 1266, that of the commentary on &quot;On the Heavens&quot; in June 1271. Earlier – in the period 1235–1253 – Robert Grosseteste had made a partial translation of the Commentary on &quot;On the Heavens&quot; which had a strong influence on philosophers including Thomas Aquinas, Henry of Ghent, Aegidius Romanus and Johannes Duns Scotus. Aquinas followed Simplicius&#x27; harmonizing interpretation of the relationship between Plato and Aristotle, and made extensive use of Simplicius&#x27; commentary on Aristotle&#x27;s Categories. Petrus de Alvernia used in his commentary on &quot;Über den Himmel&quot; a wealth of material from the relevant work of his ancient predecessor, and Heinrich Bate in his great handbook &quot;Speculum Divinorum et Quorundam Naturalium&quot; partly agreeing, partly disagreeing with the theses put forward by Simplicius in his commentary on &quot;On the Heavens&quot; rather than relying on the authority of Simplicius. From this it can be seen that Simplicius&#x27; commentary on Aristotle enjoyed an extraordinary reputation.

==== Byzantine Empire ====

The Byzantine princess Theodora Rhaulaina, a niece of Emperor Michael VIII, copied the &quot;Physics&quot; commentary of Simplicius in the period 1261–1282. This text-critical Codex has been preserved and is now in the Historical Museum in Moscow. The Byzantine philosopher Georgios Gemistos Plethon († 1452), a Platonist and opponent of Aristotelianism, disapproved of Simplicius&#x27; harmonization of Aristotelian and Platonic philosophy. He claimed that Simplicius only undertook this in order to favorably contrast an alleged unity among the pagan philosophers with the disputes among the Christians. However, he did not present anything convincing to support this claim.

===Modern===
For Hegel, Simplicius was &quot;the most learned and most astute of the Greek commentators on Aristotle&quot;. In Hegel&#x27;s time, however, several of the works of the Neoplatonist were still unprinted. The first modern critical edition of Simplicius&#x27; commentaries on Aristotle was only begun in 1882 by the Berlin Academy of Sciences; The last volume appeared in 1907. The project was led by Hermann Diels. At that time, the commentaries were valued above all as sources for the history of philosophy of earlier epochs and for the ancient reception of Aristotle. From this point of view, Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff judged that the &quot;excellent Simplicius&quot; had been &quot;a good man&quot; and that the world could never thank him enough for the preservation of fragments from lost older works. 

Simplicius&#x27; own philosophical achievement received less attention; the disdain that was widespread in the 19th and early 20th centuries for late antique Neoplatonism, which was then notorious for being too speculative, stood in the way of an unbiased assessment. Eduard Zeller (1903) found the commentaries to be &quot;the work of great diligence and comprehensive erudition&quot; and offer a &quot;careful and mostly reasonable explanation&quot; of the texts interpreted. However, Zeller considered Simplicius&#x27; denial of considerable contradictions between Aristotle and Plato to be completely wrong, characterizing as someone a thinker who hardly made an original philosophical achievement, but was only &quot;the thinking editor of a given teaching that has come to its conclusion in all essential respects&quot;. Karl Praechter (1927) judged that the commentary tradition exemplified by Simplicius was one of the most attractive phenomena of late antiquity due to its “mutual complementation and tempering of Platonic and Aristotelian ways of thinking”, stressing Simplicius&#x27; &quot;love of solid scholarship both in the philosophical and philological-literary areas as well as in the exact sciences&quot;.

In the second half of the 20th century, however, research into his teachings intensified. Since then, his comprehensive synthesis of Aristotelian and Neoplatonic ideas has been recognized as an important achievement.

<text>Priscianus Caesariensis (), commonly known as Priscian ( or ), was a Latin grammarian and the author of the &quot;Institutes of Grammar&quot;, which was the standard textbook for the study of Latin during the Middle Ages. It also provided the raw material for the field of speculative grammar.

==Life==
The details of Priscian&#x27;s life are largely unknown. Priscian was born and raised in the North-African city of Caesarea (modern Cherchell, Algeria), the capital of the Roman province of Mauretania Caesariensis, which during his lifetime would be under the control of the Vandalic Kingdom. He was probably of Greek descent. According to Cassiodorus, he taught Latin at Constantinople in the early sixth century. His minor works include a panegyric to Anastasius (491—518), written about 512, which helps establish his time period. In addition, the manuscripts of his &quot;Institutes&quot; contain a subscription to the effect that the work was copied (526, 527) by Flavius Theodorus, a clerk in the imperial secretariat.

==Works==

Priscian&#x27;s most famous work, the &quot;Institutes of Grammar&quot; (), is a systematic exposition of Latin grammar. The dedication to Julian probably indicates the consul and patrician, not the author of a well-known epitome of Justinian&#x27;s &quot;Novellae&quot;, who lived somewhat later than Priscian. The grammar is divided into eighteen books, of which the first sixteen deal mainly with sounds, word-formation and inflexions; the last two, which form from a fourth to a third of the whole work, deal with syntax.

Priscian&#x27;s grammar is based on the earlier works of Herodian and Apollonius. The examples it includes to illustrate the rules preserve numerous fragments from Latin authors which would otherwise have been lost, including Ennius, Pacuvius, Accius, Lucilius, Cato and Varro. But the authors whom he quotes most frequently are Virgil, and, next to him, Terence, Cicero, Plautus; then Lucan, Horace, Juvenal, Sallust, Statius, Ovid, Livy and Persius.

The grammar was quoted by several writers in Britain of the 8th century - Aldhelm, Bede, Alcuin - and was abridged or largely used in the next century by Hrabanus Maurus of Fulda and Servatus Lupus of Ferrières. About a thousand manuscripts exist, all ultimately derived from the copy made by Theodorus. Most copies contain only books I—XVI; these are sometimes known as the &quot;Priscianus Major&quot; (&quot;Greater Priscian&quot;). Others contain only books XVII and XVIII along with the three books to Symmachus; these are known as his work &quot;On Construction&quot; (&quot;&quot;) or the &quot;Priscianus Minor&quot; (&quot;Lesser Priscian&quot;). A few copies contain both parts. The earliest manuscripts are from the 9th century, though a few fragments are somewhat earlier.

Priscian&#x27;s minor works include:
* Three treatises dedicated to Symmachus (the father-in-law of Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius): on weights and measures; on the metres of Terence; and the &quot;Praeexercitamina&quot;, a translation into Latin of Greek rhetorical exercises from Hermogenes.
* &quot;De nomine, pronomine, et verbo&quot; (&quot;On noun, pronoun, and verb&quot;), an abridgment of part of his &quot;Institutes&quot; for teaching grammar in schools
* &quot;Partitiones xii. versuum Aeneidos principalium&quot;: another teaching aid, using question and answer to dissect the first lines of each of the twelve books of the Aeneid. The metre is discussed first, each verse is scanned, and each word thoroughly and instructively examined.
* The poem on Anastasius mentioned above, in 312 hexameters with a short iambic introduction
* A translation in 1087 hexameters of the verse-form geographical survey by Dionysius Periegetes.

==Legacy==
Books XVII &amp; XVIII of the &quot;Institutes&quot;, his work &quot;On Construction&quot;, was part of the core curriculum of the University of Paris in the 13th century and Roger Bacon&#x27;s lectures for the class were the probable origin of his own &quot;Overview of Grammar&quot;, one of the first expositions on the idea of a universal grammar.

Dante places Priscian in Hell among the sodomites in Canto XV of his &quot;Inferno&quot;. Dante&#x27;s contemporaries knew of no historical evidence that Priscian was a sodomite. Giovanni Boccaccio suggested that Priscian was placed here to signify teachers of grammar in general, who were reputed to frequently sexually abuse their young students.

<doc id="80448" wikidata="Q5589303" url="?curid=80448" title="Government of Puerto Rico">
<text>The government of the [[Government of Puerto Rico|Commonwealth]] of [[Puerto Rico]] is a republican democracy established by the Constitution of Puerto Rico in 1952. Under a system of separation of powers, the government is divided among three branches: the executive, the legislative, and the judicial. As a territory of the United States, the government of Puerto Rico is under the jurisdiction of the federal government of the United States. 

Article I of the Constitution of Puerto Rico defines the government of Puerto Rico as a republican form of government seated in San Juan with executive, legislative, and judicial powers within the archipelago and island of Puerto Rico.

Article IV defines the executive branch as headed by the governor, currently Jenniffer González-Colón, who is also the head of government. Article III defines the legislative branch as consisting of a bicameral legislature, namely the Legislative Assembly, composed by the Senate as its upper house and by the House of Representatives as its lower house. The governor and legislators are elected by popular vote every four years. 

Article V defines the judicial branch as headed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, currently Maite Oronoz Rodríguez. The legal system is a mixture of the civil law and the common law systems. Members of the judicial branch are appointed by the governor with advice and consent from the Senate.

The extent of the powers of the government of Puerto Rico and the rights of the citizens of Puerto Rico as enumerated in the Constitution of Puerto Rico and the laws of Puerto Rico are subject to the authority of the Constitution of the United States and the laws of the United States, which are enacted and amended by the Congress of the United States, executed and enforced by the President of the United States, and interpreted and validated by the Supreme Court of the United States. Puerto Rico is subject to the jurisdiction of the federal government of the United States and the territorial sovereignty of the United States. Its head of state is the president of the United States, currently Donald Trump.

As an unincorporated territory of the United States, Puerto Rico is neither a sovereign state nor a state of the United States. The federal government of the United States has enumerated powers, including monetary policy, foreign relations, and defense. The local government of Puerto Rico has reserved powers, including education, law enforcement, and elections. Both governments share concurrent powers, including taxation and fiscal policy. The political status of Puerto Rico is an ongoing debate.

==History==
Puerto Rico was ceded to the United States by Spain at the end of the Spanish–American War by the Treaty of Paris of 1898. The Foraker Act of 1900 provided for an organization of the civilian government. The Jones–Shafroth Act of 1917 re-organized the government.

The United States government authorized Puerto Rico to draft its own constitution by . On June 4, 1951, the Puerto Ricans voted to hold a constitutional convention in a referendum, and elected delegates on August 27, 1951. The convention adopted a constitution on 6 February 1952 and was ratified by Puerto Rico&#x27;s electorate in a referendum on March 3, 1952.

The United States government approved an amended version by , and on July 10, 1952, the Constitutional Convention of Puerto Rico reconvened and approved the conditions established by . On July 25, 1952, Governor Luis Muñoz Marín proclaimed that the Constitution of Puerto Rico was in effect.

==Executive branch==
The executive branch is responsible for administering public resources, as well as providing all necessary public services to the Puerto Rican general public. It is by far the largest branch in the government as well as the largest employer in Puerto Rico with more than 150,000 workers.

===Governor===

The head of government is the Governor of Puerto Rico, who is elected every four years in a general election. The position is similar in nature, responsibility, and power as those of a governor of a U.S. state. The position of Governor has the overall responsibility of the state of the commonwealth, equivalent to the state of the union in the U.S. The official residence of the governor is La Fortaleza, the oldest executive mansion in continuous use in the Western Hemisphere.

The Governor has the authority to nominate agency heads, trial and appellate judges, as well as Supreme Court justices and directors of public corporations, although these must be confirmed by the Senate and, in a handful of cases, the House, as well. Similar to a U.S. State, the Governor has authority over the Puerto Rico National Guard.

Although Puerto Rico does not have the position of Lieutenant Governor, sections 7 and 8 of the Constitution empower the Secretary of the Puerto Rico State Department to act as Acting Governor, should the governor be absent from Puerto Rico, become temporarily disabled or unable to discharge his/her duties, and as Governor for the remainder of the term should a permanent vacancy occur.

===Lieutenant governor===
Puerto Rico does not have a post for lieutenant governor but it has a Secretary of State which performs a similar role. The Secretary of State is the successor of the Governor and is empowered to act as acting governor— the Constitution of Puerto Rico and Puerto Rican law establishes a governmental line of succession starting with the Secretary of State.

===Acting Governor===
Article IV of the Constitution of Puerto Rico establishes that the Secretary of State should serve as acting governor when the Governor is not available. The Constitution and Puerto Rican law establishes a governmental line of succession for special cases when neither the Governor nor the Secretary are available.

===Cabinet===
Article IV of the Constitution of Puerto Rico establishes that the Governor shall be assisted by Secretaries who shall collectively constitute the Governor&#x27;s advisory council and be designated as the &quot;Council of Secretaries&quot; although it&#x27;s mostly referred to as the &quot;Cabinet&quot;.

The Cabinet is composed by the Constitutional Cabinet, composed by the Secretaries established by the Constitution, and the Operational Cabinet, composed by the Secretaries established by extraconstitutional Puerto Rican law or appointed by the Governor. These Cabinets do not exist as agencies, but are referred as such in transcripts, records, official documents, and conversations for brevity and easiness.

All Cabinet members are nominated by the Governor and then presented to the Senate for advice and consent by a simple majority. If they are approved, they are sworn in and then begin their duties. All members receive the title of &quot;Secretary&quot;.

Members of the Cabinet serve at the pleasure of the Governor, who may dismiss them or reappoint them (to other posts) at will.

===Executive departments===

The day-to-day enforcement and administration of laws is delegated by the Governor to 16 executive departments created by the Constitution or by statute to deal with specific areas of government. The heads of the departments, chosen by the governor and approved by the Senate (with the exception of the Secretary of State, who requires Senate and House confirmation), form a council of advisers generally known as the Governor&#x27;s Cabinet.

The Constitution provides for the creation of at least 8 departments: Departments of State, Justice, Education, Health, Treasury, Labor, Agriculture, Commerce, and Public Works. However, due to the increase in population, economy, and public needs over the years, the Puerto Rico government has expanded the executive branch by establishing additional executive departments not specified in the Constitution. These additional departments are established by public law or so-called &quot;reorganization plans&quot;, as approved by the legislative assembly.

The title of Secretary is given to the heads of the executive departments, whose position is also created by statute. Cabinet member is another title primarily given by the media and the public, though it is considered unofficial. All cabinet-level Secretaries are first nominated by the Governor and are confirmed by the legislative assembly.

Each department has different divisions, agencies, bureaus, offices, and services, each with specific duties, in order to provide the necessary services to the general public across the island.

===Government-owned corporations===
Puerto Rico has also established several government-owned corporations in order to provide basic and public services to its citizens, including electricity, water, transportation, and education, among others. These are separate legal entities from the Commonwealth, but the government owns virtually all of these corporations&#x27; stock. Each corporation is headed by an executive director who is appointed by the corporations’ Board of Directors. The directors are nominated by the Governor and confirmed by the state legislative assembly.

Although government-owned corporations are separate from the commonwealth government, who generate their income and expenses independently, several of those have faced financial troubles, and have constantly relied on so called “bail-outs” from the commonwealth to offset recurring losses and deficits, and have been unable to legally declare bankruptcy.

==Legislative branch==

Article III of the Constitution of Puerto Rico grants all legislative powers of the commonwealth government to the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico, which is divided into two chambers: a 27-member Senate and a 51-member House of Representatives. The chambers are presided over by the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House, respectively. Both positions are occupied by an active member of each body, elected by a majority of both chambers. The current heads are Senator Eduardo Bhatia and Representative Jaime Perelló Borrás, respectively.

Members are elected to both chambers in general elections held every four years, along with the elections for the Governor and the 78 municipal mayors. Each member of the Legislative Assembly represents an electoral district, with the exception of a number of legislators who are considered at-large and represent the island as a whole. Members representing specific districts are elected by the citizens residing within the district, while at-large legislators are elected by accumulation of all island votes.

===Constitutional changes===
In recent years, two referendums have been held to propose constitutional changes to substantially modify the composition of the Legislative Assembly.

Various organizations pushed for changing the legislative assembly from the current two-chamber system (House and Senate) prevalent in 49 of the 50 states of the nation to one-chamber (unicameralism). The reasons for this proposed change was based on the growing public opinion that members of the assembly are overpaid, and that a smaller assembly might achieve the same work results as the bicameral one with less public expenditures. However, an official report of 1995 indicates that this argument should not be considered the primary objective because the savings are not significant. The legislative spending in Puerto Rico, compared with the consolidated government budget is less than 1% of total government spending.

Lacking the two-thirds majority necessary in both houses of the Legislature to submit constitutional amendments to the electorate, in 2004 the Popular Democratic Party&#x27;s then-majority approved legislation to hold a referendum, not on a particular constitutional amendment as such, but on the general concept of switching from a bicameral to a unicameral system which was held on July 10, 2005. Attended by less than 25% of the islands&#x27; electorate, Puerto Rican voters approved the change to a unicameral legislature by 456,267 votes in favor, versus 88,720 against. (Voter turnout was 22.6% of the electorate.) Almost four years later, incoming Governor Luis Fortuño (from the New Progressive Party or New Party of Progress (NPP)) discarded the alternative of unicameralism claiming that the NPP&#x27;s platform, rather than advocating unicameralism, supported submitting to the people a constitutional amendment proposing a substantial reduction in seats in the existing bicameral legislature.

In 2012, Governor Fortuño proposed, and by a two thirds majority in both houses, the Legislature approved submitting to the people a constitutional amendment reducing the size of the House from 51 to 39 seats and the Senate from 27 to 17 seats, essentially a 30% reduction in size. However, in an August 18, 2012 referendum, the constitutional proposition failed by a 54% to 46% margin.

==Judicial branch==
The judiciary of Puerto Rico consists of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, Court of Appeals, and the Court of First Instance consisting of the Superior Courts and the Municipal Courts. The Supreme Court, the commonwealth&#x27;s highest court, holds its sessions in San Juan&#x27;s Miramar district.

==Local government==
Puerto Rico is divided into 78 municipalities, each headed by a mayor. The municipalities also have a municipal legislature, which is in charge of overseeing the mayor&#x27;s operations, holding public meetings, and enacting municipal resolutions and ordinances. Both the mayor and the municipal legislators are elected at-large by the municipality&#x27;s citizens in general elections held every four years. Unlike most towns, cities and states in the United States, Puerto Rico does not have local or state sheriffs; sheriff duties are instead performed by the Puerto Rico Commonwealth Marshal&#x27;s Office. Many municipalities have established municipal police departments, although most law enforcement activity is carried out by the Puerto Rico Police (PPR).

==Government finances==

Puerto Rico&#x27;s central government, which includes all three branches of government but excludes public corporations and municipalities, has an annual general budget that currently ranges from $8.5 billion to $9 billion in revenues and expenditures. The government also receives more than $4.2 billion annually in subsidies and federal aid from the United States. A substantial portion of this amount is earmarked for public welfare, including funding educational programs (such as Head Start), subsidized housing programs (such as Section 8 and public housing projects), and a food stamp system called the Nutrition Assistance for Puerto Rico program.

Government-owned corporations generate approximately $6.3 billion in general revenues by charging citizens for the services they provide. The largest government-owned corporation, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), generates almost half of those revenues alone ($3 billion). However, government-owned corporations generate about $10.6 billion in expenses when combined, requiring substantial subsidies by the central government. In 2005, the central government provided more than $2.6 billion in subsidies, while the remaining expenditures were funded through interest and investment earnings.

When considering all three branches of government, including all government-owned corporations and municipalities, the government of Puerto Rico&#x27;s annual expenditures can reach to more than $28 billion.

===Central government revenues===
The central government&#x27;s main source of revenue is income tax imposed on individual citizens and private companies, which can amount to approximately $5.5 billion. Other significant sources of revenue include excise taxes on imports, cigarettes, liquor, hotel rooms, cement, and vehicles ($2 billion); and lotteries ($870 million).

====Sales and Use Tax====
On November 15, 2006, the government eliminated the excise tax of 6.6% on imports (taxes on cigarettes, liquor, and cars are still in effect) and substituted it for a 5.5% islandwide Sales and Use Tax, plus a municipal sales tax of 1.5%, for a total of 7%, in what has been known as the Puerto Rico Tax Reform. This change was partly due to the government&#x27;s growing expenditures and fiscal deficits which remained unchecked and uncorrected for several years, until several credit agencies warned public officials that all general-obligation bonds issued by the government were to be downgraded if the problem was not corrected.

The situation reached a turning point when the executive branch of the government was partially shutdown, the events now known as the 2006 Puerto Rico budget crisis. Thirty-three (33) agencies were closed and 95,762 employees were sent home without pay. Following public bickering between the two main political parties, the new sales tax was approved in favor of the excise tax on imports on May 10, 2006, ending the budget crisis.

===Central government expenditures===
The largest types of expenditures made by the government are those related to education. In 2005 alone, the government expended more than $5 billion in public education and education-related programs, representing approx. 28% of total government expenditures (excluding public corporations). Other significant expenditures include public housing and welfare ($3.4 billion or 19%), public safety ($2.5 billion or 14%) and public health ($2.3 billion or 13%).

===Public debt===
In May 2007, local economists expressed serious concerns when it was revealed that the Puerto Rico public debt equaled to 76% of its gross national product (GNP), making it one of the most indebted countries by percentage in the world, even more than the United States. Economists have criticized the government&#x27;s fiscal policy, whose level of expenditures and indebtedness has increased significantly within the past decade while the economy was grown at a much slower pace. Between 2000 and 2006 alone, Puerto Rico&#x27;s GNP rose 5.37%, while its public debt&#x27;s relation to GNP rose 18%. By comparison, many other Latin American countries have seen reductions in their GNP-public debt percentages during that same time period.

By early 2017, the Puerto Rican government-debt crisis posed serious problems for the government which was saddled with outstanding bond debt that had climbed to $70 billion or $12,000 per capita at a time with a 45 percent poverty rate and 12.4% unemployment that is more than twice the mainland U.S. average. The debt had been increasing during a decade long recession.

The Commonwealth had been defaulting on many debts, including bonds, since 2015. With debt payments due, the Governor was facing the risk of a government shutdown and failure to fund the managed care health system. &quot;Without action before April, Puerto Rico’s ability to execute contracts for Fiscal Year 2018 with its managed care organizations will be threatened, thereby putting at risk beginning July 1, 2017 the health care of up to 900,000 poor U.S. citizens living in Puerto Rico&quot;, according to a letter sent to Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. They also said that &quot;Congress must enact measures recommended by both Republicans and Democrats that fix Puerto Rico’s inequitable health care financing structure and promote sustained economic growth.&quot;

Initially, the oversight board created under PROMESA called for Puerto Rico&#x27;s governor Ricardo Rosselló to deliver a fiscal turnaround plan by January 28. Just before that deadline, the control board gave the Commonwealth government until February 28 to present a fiscal plan (including negotiations with creditors for restructuring debt) to solve the problems. A moratorium on lawsuits by debtors was extended to May 31. It is essential for Puerto Rico to reach restructuring deals to avoid a bankruptcy-like process under PROMESA.

Statehood might be useful as a means of dealing with the financial crisis, since it would allow for bankruptcy and the relevant protection. In the Puerto Rican status referendum, 2020, the majority of voters approved of Puerto Rico becoming a state. However, the referendum was non-binding, and there has been little federal action since the referendum.

According to the Government Development Bank, statehood might be the only solution to the debt crisis. Congress has the power to vote to allow Chapter 9 protection without the need for statehood, but in late 2015 there was very little support in the House for this concept. Other benefits to statehood include increased disability benefits and Medicaid funding, the right to vote in Presidential elections and the higher (federal) minimum wage.

<text>A panegyric ( or ) is a formal public speech or written verse, delivered in high praise of a person or thing. The original panegyrics were speeches delivered at public events in ancient Athens.

==Etymology==
The word originated as a compound of - &#x27;all&#x27; (the form taken by the word πᾶν, neuter of πᾶς &#x27;all&#x27;, when that is used as a prefix) and the word &#x27;assembly&#x27; (an Aeolic dialect form, corresponding to the Attic or Ionic form ). Compounded, these gave &#x27;general or national assembly, especially a festival in honour of a god&#x27; and the derived adjective &#x27;of or for a public assembly or festival&#x27;. In Hellenistic Greek the noun came also to mean &#x27;a festal oration, laudatory speech&#x27;, and the adjective &#x27;of or relating to a eulogy, flattering&#x27;. The noun had been borrowed into Classical Latin by around the second century CE, as &quot;panēgyris&quot; &#x27;festival&#x27; (in post-Classical usage also &#x27;general assembly&#x27;). Correspondingly, Classical Latin also included the adjective &quot;panēgyricus&quot;, which appears meaning &#x27;laudatory&#x27;, but also came to function as a noun, meaning &#x27;public eulogy&#x27;. These words inspired similar formations in European languages in the early modern period, such as French &quot;panégyrique&quot;, attested by 1512. The English noun and adjective &quot;panegyric&quot; seems to have been borrowed from the French word, but no doubt with cognisance of its Latin and Greek origins.

==Classical Greece==
In Athens such speeches were delivered at national festivals or games, with the object of rousing the citizens to emulate the glorious deeds of their ancestors. The most famous are the &quot;Olympiacus&quot; of Gorgias, the &quot;Olympiacus&quot; of Lysias, and the &quot;Panegyricus&quot; and &quot;Panathenaicus&quot; (neither of them, however, actually delivered) of Isocrates. Funeral orations, such as the famous speech of Pericles in Thucydides, also partook of the nature of panegyrics.

==Roman Empire==
The Romans generally confined the panegyric to the living—with the deceased receiving funeral orations instead. The most celebrated example of a Latin panegyric, however, is that delivered by the younger Pliny (AD 100) in the Senate on the occasion of his assumption of the consulship, which contained a eulogy of Trajan considered fulsome by some scholars.
Towards the end of the 3rd and during the 4th century, as a result of the orientalizing of the Imperial court by Diocletian, it became customary to celebrate as a matter of course the superhuman virtues and achievements of the reigning emperor, in a formally staged literary event. In 336, Eusebius of Caesarea gave a panegyric of Constantine the Great on the 30th year of his reign, in which he broke from tradition by celebrating the piety of the emperor, rather than his secular achievements. 
A well-delivered, elegant and witty panegyric became a vehicle for an educated but inexperienced young man to attract desirable attention in a competitive sphere. The poet Claudian came to Rome from Alexandria before about 395 and made his first reputation with a panegyric; he became court poet to Stilicho.

Cassiodorus, &quot;magister officiorum&quot; of Theodoric the Great, left a book of panegyrics, the &quot;Laudes&quot;. One of his biographers, James O&#x27;Donnell, has described the genre thus: &quot;It was to be expected that the praise contained in the speech would be excessive; the intellectual point of the exercise (and very likely an important criterion in judging it) was to see how excessive the praise could be made while remaining within boundaries of decorum and restraint, how much high praise could be made to seem the grudging testimony of simple honesty&quot;.

In the Byzantine Empire, the &quot;basilikos logos&quot; was a formal panegyric for an emperor delivered on an important occasion.

==Arabic==
Panegyric poems were a major literary form among the Arabs. Writing in the Arabic language, Al-Mutanabbi wrote about Sayf al-Dawla&#x27;s celebrated campaign against the Byzantine Empire.

==Persia==
Persian language panegyric poems from the Middle Ages contain details on the life of court poets and their patrons, and shed light on contemporary attitudes and matters of political and military interest such as Farrukhi Sistani&#x27;s &quot;qasida&quot; on Ghaznavid ruler Mahmud of Ghazni&#x27;s incursion against the Somnath temple. Poems were composed for festivals like Eid al-Fitr, Nowruz and Mihragan. Some poems depicted the patron as a hero in a battle between Islam and infidels. Wars against Muslims required additional explanations and some poems by Farrukhi and Mu&#x27;izzi advocated in favor of Mahmud&#x27;s capture of Rayy and Ahmad Sanjar&#x27;s attacks against the Ghaznavid ruler Arslan-Shah in 1117. These poems are important sources for the Great Seljuq period from which few records survive.

In a panegyric poem address to Mahmud of Ghazna, Firdausi said: &quot;Noble buildings are ruined by rain and by the heat of the sun./I have laid the foundations of a high palace of poetry which will not be damaged by wind and rain.&quot; This is similar to the grandiose claims of the Roman poet Horace who says, in an address to the Emperor Augustus, that his poetry was more lasting than bronze and grander than the pyramids.

==Africa==
African oral tradition includes panegyric customs such as praise names and praise poetry. Often these customs serve mnemonic and genealogical functions within the continent&#x27;s numerous ethnic groups, and are usually also tied to tribal spirituality.

Examples include Oriki amongst the Yoruba people, Isibongo amongst the Zulu people, and Iziduko amongst the Xhosa people.

==Modern revival==
The custom of panegyrics addressed to monarchs was revived in the Baroque period, though there do exist Renaissance examples such as Bruni&#x27;s &quot;Laudatio florentinae urbis&quot; to Florence of 1403, and Erasmus&#x27;s &quot;Panegyricus&quot;, first published in 1504. Thus, in 1660, several panegyrics were published by English poets in honour of Charles II of England coming to power. Another significant work includes the &quot;Panegyric for the Duke of Lerma&quot;, written by the Spanish poet Luis de Góngora in 1617. Russian poets of the eighteenth century, most notably Mikhail Lomonosov, adopted the panegyric form to celebrate the achievements of Russian emperors and empresses.

<text>Rapeman was an American noise rock band founded in 1987 and disbanded in 1989. It consisted of Steve Albini (formerly of Big Black) on guitar and vocals, David Wm. Sims (formerly of Scratch Acid) on bass and Rey Washam (formerly of Scratch Acid and Big Boys) on drums. In the years since their brief tenure, Rapeman’s sound has also been described as post-hardcore. 

Rapeman were formed as a parallel sister project to the Jesus Lizard, although the latter outlasted Rapeman by several years.

==History==
Rapeman was formed in 1987 when drummer Rey Washam and bassist David Wm. Sims relocated to Chicago from Texas after the breakup of their band Scratch Acid. Steve Albini had just ended his group Big Black, and was looking to switch to a musical project with a live drummer, instead of his Roland TR-606 drum machine. 

Rapeman&#x27;s initial 1988 releases included the mostly live recorded &quot;Budd&quot; EP, the &quot;Hated Chinee&quot; b/w &quot;Marmoset&quot; 7&quot; single, and their sole album, &quot;Two Nuns and a Pack Mule&quot;. The band recorded in Albini&#x27;s own home studio, often giving production credit to someone named Fluss, later revealed to be Albini&#x27;s cat. 

All of Rapeman’s records were originally released on Touch and Go Records in the US, Blast First in the UK, and Au Go Go in Australia. Rapeman left Blast First in 1990 after Albini had an argument with the label over the release of a Big Black record. Touch and Go started distributing in the UK in 1992 and re-released Rapeman&#x27;s records there.
The band&#x27;s final record before their breakup, the &quot;Inki&#x27;s Butt Crack&quot; instrumental 7&quot; single, was issued in 1989 as part of the Sub Pop Singles Club.

Albini later played bass in live iterations of Pete Conway’s solo project, Flour, before going on to form Shellac and expanding his work as a recording engineer. Sims reunited with ex-Scratch Acid vocalist David Yow to form the Jesus Lizard (with Albini recording their albums). Washam went on to drum for former Chrome guitarist Helios Creed. Albini died on May 7, 2024.

=== Name ===
The name Rapeman was taken from the Japanese manga series &quot;The Rapeman.&quot; Albini discovered the manga through a friend who ran an import business, and found its combination of rape fantasies and the superhero genre &quot;simultaneously utterly repellent and fascinating&quot;. He described it as &quot;the product of decades of repression and misogyny being expressed through a different cultural tradition&quot;. He named the band in a deliberate attempt to repel audiences and do the &quot;opposite&quot; of bands that were desperate to appear on MTV.

Rapeman&#x27;s name drew criticism and protests at several gigs. In a 2020 interview on the &quot;Conan Neutron&#x27;s Protonic Reversal&quot; podcast, Albini called it a &quot;flippant choice&quot; that was unconscionable and indefensible. He likened it to getting a bad tattoo. In a 2021 interview with &quot;MEL Magazine&quot;, Albini said he had been ignorant of women&#x27;s issues and had falsely assumed that many social problems, such as misogyny and homophobia, were already solved. In a &quot;Kreative Kontrol&quot; podcast in 2014, Sims said the name was his biggest musical regret.

<text>Avro Canada was a Canadian aircraft manufacturing company. It was founded in 1945 as an aircraft plant and within 13 years became the third-largest company in Canada, one of the largest 100 companies in the world, and directly employing over 50,000. Avro Canada was best known for the CF-105 Arrow, but through growth and acquisition, it rapidly became a major, integrated company that had diverse holdings.

Following the cancellation of the CF-105 Arrow the company ceased operations in 1962.

==A.V. Roe Canada==

===Origins===
During World War II, Victory Aircraft in Malton, Ontario, was Canada&#x27;s largest aircraft manufacturer. Prior to 1939, as a part of National Steel Car of Hamilton, the concern was one of a number of &quot;shadow factories&quot; set up in Canada to produce British aircraft designs far out of range of enemy attack. National Steel Car produced Avro Anson trainers, Handley Page Hampden bombers, Hawker Hurricane fighters and Westland Lysander army cooperation aircraft. National Steel Car Corporation of Malton, Ontario was formed in 1938 and renamed Victory Aircraft in 1942 when the Canadian government took over ownership and management of the main plant. During World War II, Victory Aircraft built Avro (UK) aircraft: 3,197 Anson trainers, 430 Lancaster bombers, six Lancastrian, one Lincoln bomber and one York transport.

===Avro Canada===
In 1944, an Advisory Committee on Aircraft Manufacture was established by the Canadian government, the Canadian Director of Aircraft Production wrote to Minister of Munitions and Supply Clarence Howe in 1944 to express the &quot;utmost importance to Canada&quot; of the establishment of a Canadian aircraft industry, and UK-based Avro also established in 1944 a company searching for post-war opportunities. Bob Leckie of the Royal Canadian Air Force was a strong advocate over many years, for a wholly domestic &quot;end-to-end&quot; industry, that would design and build aircraft (and their engines) in Canada. However, the Department of National Defence, according to Avro&#x27;s Roy Dobson, gave &quot;a cold reception&quot; to doing any more than the fabrication and assembly of aircraft and engines under licence.

Howe, as Minister of Reconstruction and Minister of Munitions and Supply (later Reconstruction and Supply), brokered the deal with Hawker Siddeley to take over the Victory Aircraft plant in 1945 with Frederick T. Smye hired by HSG&#x27;s Roy Dobson as its first employee. Smye, born in Hamilton, Ontario, had risen through the ranks of the government&#x27;s departments overseeing wartime aircraft production, to Assistant General Manager of Federal Aircraft Limited, the Crown Corporation managing production of the Avro Anson at the National Steel Car/Victory Aircraft plant.

In 1945, the UK-based Hawker Siddeley purchased Victory Aircraft from the Canadian government, creating A.V. Roe Canada Ltd. as the wholly owned Canadian branch of its aircraft manufacturing subsidiary, UK-based A.V. Roe and Company. Avro Canada began operations in the former Victory plant. Avro Aircraft (Canada), their first (and, at the time, only) division, turned to the repair and servicing of a number of World War II era aircraft, including Hawker Sea Fury fighters, North American B-25 Mitchell and Avro Lancaster bombers. From the outset, the company invested in research and development and embarked on an ambitious design program with a jet engine and a jet-powered fighter and airliner on the drawing boards.

===Expansion and diversification===
A.V. Roe Canada was restructured in 1954 as a holding company with two aviation subsidiaries: Avro Aircraft. and Orenda Engines, which began operating under these names on 1 January 1955. Each company&#x27;s facilities were located across from each other in a complex at the perimeter of Malton Airport. The total labour force of both aviation companies reached 15,000 in 1958.

During the same period, with Crawford Gordon as president, A.V. Roe Canada purchased a number of companies, including Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation, Canadian Car and Foundry (1957), and Canadian Steel Improvement. By 1958, A. V. Roe Canada Ltd. was an industrial giant with over 50,000 employees in a far-flung empire of 44 companies involved in coal mining, steel making, railway rolling stock, aircraft and aero-engine manufacturing, as well as computers and electronics. In 1956 the companies generated 45% of the revenue of the Hawker Siddeley Group. In 1958, annual sales revenue was approximately $450 million, ranking A.V. Roe Canada as the third largest corporation in Canada by capitalization. By the time of the cancellation of the Arrow and Iroquois, aircraft-related production amounted to approximately 40% of the company&#x27;s activities with 60% industrial and commercial.

In 1956, 500,000 shares were issued to the public at a total value of $8 million. By 1958, 48% of the shares of A.V. Roe Canada were publicly traded on the stock exchange. Although controlled and largely owned by UK-based Hawker Siddeley Group, all profits from A.V. Roe Canada were retained within the company to fund development and growth. Management of the Canadian companies remained in Canadian hands.

* Fred Smye served as director of Canadian Aircraft Production during World War II, in 1944 joined Federal Aircraft in Montreal (later Victory Aircraft). When Hawker Siddeley purchased Victory Aircraft in 1945, Smye became the first employee of A.V. Roe Canada and later that year he became assistant general manager of Avro Aircraft. He later served as president of Canadian Applied Research and Canadian Steel Improvement.
* Crawford Gordon left the Department of Defence Production in 1951 to take over as President and General Manager of A. V. Roe Canada to assist with problems in development and production of the Avro Canada CF-100 Canuck. Gordon oversaw Avro Canada&#x27;s restructuring and expansion during the 1950s into the third largest corporation in Canada.

==Avro Canada aircraft==

===CF-100 Canuck===
In 1946, A.V. Roe Canada&#x27;s next design, the Avro XC-100, Canada&#x27;s first jet fighter, started at the end of the era of propeller-driven aircraft and the beginning of the jet age. Although the design of the large, jet-powered all-weather interceptor, renamed the CF-100 Canuck, was largely complete by the next year, the factory was not tooled for production until late 1948 due to ongoing repair and maintenance contracts. The CF-100 would have a long gestation period before finally entering RCAF service in 1952, initially with the Mk 2 and Mk 3 variants.

The CF-100 Canuck operated under NORAD to protect airspace from Soviet threats such as nuclear-armed bombers during all weather and day/night conditions. Although not designed for speeds over Mach 0.85, it was taken supersonic during a dive by test pilot Janusz Żurakowski in December 1952.

A small number of CF-100s served with the RCAF until 1981 in reconnaissance, training and electronic warfare (ECM) roles. In its lifetime, a total of 692 CF-100s of different variants, including 53 aircraft for the Belgian Air Force, were produced.

===C102 Jetliner===
Work was also underway on a jet-powered civilian short- to medium-range transport known as the C102 Jetliner. It nearly became the first jet transport in the world when it first flew in August 1949, a mere 13 days following the first flight of the de Havilland Comet. The Jetliner represented a new type of regional jet airliner that would not see comparable designs until the late 1950s. An aggressive marketing campaign was directed at U.S. airlines and the USAF.

When the Rolls-Royce Avon AJ-65 engine was withdrawn from foreign markets by the British government, the design was modified to take four Derwent engines of higher weight and lower performance. The resulting design could no longer meet the operating range requirement of Trans-Canada Airlines. The sales prospects of the Jetliner floundered after the launch customer TCA withdrew from consideration of the four-engine variant. The American industrialist Howard Hughes even offered to start production under license.

The company was still attempting to get the CF-100 into production at the time and, consequently, the Canadian government cancelled any further work on the C102 due to Korean War priorities: C. D. Howe demanded the project be stopped to increase production of the CF-100, so the second C-102 prototype was scrapped in the plant in 1951, with the first relegated to photographic duties in the Flight Test Department. After a lengthy career as a camera platform and company &quot;hack&quot;, &quot;CF-EJD-X&quot; was broken up in 1956. The nose section now resides in the Canada Aviation Museum in Ottawa.

===CF-103===
In 1951, during production of the CF-100 Canuck, a design was explored for a revised version with swept wings and tail modifications. Known as the CF-103, it offered transonic performance with supersonic abilities in a dive. However, the basic CF-100 continued to improve through this period, and the advantages of the new design were greatly eroded. It was considered an interim aircraft between the CF-100 and the more advanced C-104 project, and as such development did not progress beyond creation of a full-size wooden mock-up and separate cockpit.

===C104 Advanced Fighter===
By 1950, several design proposals for a supersonic interceptor were explored which included versions with swept wings, a tail-less delta wing (similar to the Dassault Mirage IV), side-body engine intakes, in-nose engine intakes (similar to the MiG-21), turbine engines and rocket engines, and combinations of several.

In 1952, two versions of a design for a delta-wing fighter known as C104 were submitted to the Royal Canadian Air Force: the single engine C104/4 and twin-engined C104/2. The designs were otherwise similar, using a low-mounted delta-wing; the primary advantages of the C104/2 were a larger overall size which offered a much larger internal weapons bay and gave twin-engine reliability. Subsequent discussions between the RCAF and Avro examined a wide range of alternatives for a supersonic interceptor, culminating in RCAF &quot;Specification AIR 7-3&quot; in April 1953. Avro&#x27;s response became the CF-105.

===CF-105 Arrow Mk.1 and Mk.2===
The need for a newer and much more powerful interceptor aircraft was clear even before the CF-100 entered service. The CF-105 Arrow was rolled out on 4 October 1957, coincidentally the very same day the USSR launched Sputnik 1 into orbit, heralding the dawn of the space age and potentially the end of the Arrow&#x27;s main target, the long-range bomber. The design was a development of the C104, but with the delta wing raised to the top of the fuselage allowing for simplified structure, easier access to the engines and the weapons bay in the belly, as well as a weapons bay larger than that of the B-24 Liberator or Lancaster bombers. The aircraft was very advanced, powerful, and broke numerous records. Many &quot;firsts&quot; were included, such as fly-by-wire technology, and simultaneous development of a new weapons fire control system and the advanced Orenda Iroquois engine. The weapons were stored in an interchangeable pod in the internal weapons bay, allowing for ease of re-arming and switching from missiles to other kinds of weapons. Only the Mark 1 model (with lower-powered American engines) flew, including one that reached Mach 1.98. The first flight was on 25 March 1958. A total of five Mark 1 aircraft were completed with several of the 29 Mark 2 models (with more powerful Iroquois engines) on the production line nearing completion. The sudden cancellation of the Arrow project by the Canadian government on 20 February 1959 led to a massive corporate downsizing and an attempt to further diversify. Many Avro Aircraft engineers who remained were reassigned to marine, truck and automobile projects. Numerous engineering and technical staff left Avro Canada primarily for the United Kingdom and the United States in a rapid &quot;brain drain&quot;.

==Avro aircraft experimental designs==
Additional developments of the Arrow were explored by Avro&#x27;s Project Research Group under the leadership of Mario Pesando.

===Arrow Mk.3===
Even before the Arrow first flew, Avro was designing a future version, the Mark 3. Originally designed for Mach 2.5, later revised to an estimated Mach 3 with a combat ceiling of 70,500 feet, it carried more fuel, weighed over 25% more than the Mk.2, and made greater use of CNC machining and high-temperature aluminium alloys. Also proposed was a heat shield forming an ablative insulation made from carbon fibre or fibreglass in a honeycomb matrix, later used on NASA&#x27;s Mercury and Gemini programs. The engine was to be the Iroquois Mk.3, which Orenda estimated would provide 40,000 lbs of wet thrust (with afterburner). Images of the design show revised engine intakes projecting out from the fuselage to swallow the supersonic shock wave to reduce drag and increase thrust. Also proposed was capability for &quot;probe and drogue&quot; aerial refuelling made possible by the Arrow&#x27;s revolutionary flight stability systems.

===Long Range Arrow===

In early 1957, studies began on how the Arrow Mk.2 might be developed into a &quot;Long Range Arrow&quot; to meet the requirements for the USAF&#x27;s Long Range Interceptor Experimental (LRIX) program. This was thought to be suitable as under the terms of various agreements, statements, and promises to Allied and in particular Commonwealth nations, the U.S. would buy weapons from an ally if they were the best available and the Arrow seemed to fit this description. Shortly in advance of the USAF visiting Avro in 1955 to review the Arrow&#x27;s development, a contract was granted to North American Aviation for design studies for the LRIX, designated the North American XF-108 Rapier. Performance requirements were for a range of 1,000 miles, Mach 3, and combat altitude of 60,000 feet. In September 1957, Avro&#x27;s Project Studies PS-1 and PS-2 were released. PS-1 included addition of wingtip-mounted ramjets to supplement the main engines and a canard mounted above and behind the cockpit. PS-2 included wing extensions, an extended nose with retractable canard, two additional vertical stabilizers mounted on the wings, and four large ramjets. Estimated performance included sustained speeds of Mach 3 at 95,000 feet and vertical climb rate above 40,000 feet of Mach 2.5. The thrust-to-weight ratio would have been double the F-108 and over double the SR-71.

===Arrow Mk.4===
At the request of USAF Chief Scientist, a less radical modification of the Arrow than the PS-2 was pursued which became the Mark 4. The revised intakes of the Mark 3 were retained, but with smaller Curtiss-Wright ramjets, without the canards and nose extension, and with a titanium skin instead of a heat shield. Performance was reduced to Mach 3 and maximum combat altitude of 80,000 feet.

===Supersonic Avrodynes===

In 1952, Avro Chief Designer John Frost selected a group of eight engineers and draftsmen to create the Avro Special Projects Group. In its intense exploration of radical aeronautical design ideas and development of new technology, as well as security, the SPG resembled Lockheed&#x27;s &quot;Skunk Works&quot;. Initial projects included research and development work on a series of &quot;flying saucer&quot;-like vehicles. The only design that materialized beyond mock-up was the VZ-9-AV Avrocar, funded entirely by the U.S. military from 1956.

* Project Y1: &quot;the Spade&quot;

Design reports from early 1952 outlined key features of a new gas turbine propelled engine and disc-shaped vehicle: an inner disc with central eye intake with an outer, counter-rotating disc, with rear-directed thrust nozzles, later refined to include controlling the aeroplane by thrust vectoring and stabilizing the vehicle by having the large engine rotor act as a gyroscope. The aircraft was designed for vertical take-off and landing which was thought to be hazardous and required an electronic flight-stabilization system, then not-yet available. Financed largely by Avro, the Canadian government deemed these problems too expensive to finance beyond an initial funding of $400,000. A USAF-led delegation to Avro in December 1953 gave Avro the opportunity to discuss their projects, but Y-1 was not deemed worthy of financing.

* Project Y2
In mid-1954, Frost proposed &quot;Project Y-2: Flat Vertical Take-Off Gyroplane&quot; in response to requests by the US Air Force and US Navy for &quot;vertical rising point-defense fighters&quot;. In late 1954, the USAF purchased the development rights to this saucer-shaped VTOL vehicle powered by more conventional engines than, and designed to avoid many of the problems with, the Y-1. The USAF designated it Project MX-1794 and studies of the Avro saucer designs Project Silver Bug. Through 1958, Avro spent $2.5 million and the USAF $5.4 million funding the project. Numerous models were constructed and wind-tunnel testing was undertaken at MIT and Wright Patterson Air Force Base (where Roswell UFO studies were reportedly undertaken).

The design included eight Armstrong Siddeley Viper turbojet engines, a very large centre rotor/impeller with Lundstrom compressor turbines, with the cockpit mounted in the top/centre. Control was achieved through eight small exhausts at the outer edge, directed either through the top or bottom, in addition to the main turbine exhaust through the bottom/centre of the craft. A multi-engine test rig was built and tested in 1956, resulting in powerful thrust and a great deal of noise, and vibration. One Special Projects Group member reported that the prototype was secretly removed by the US Navy for further testing in California.

Avro also decided to internally fund development of a radial-flow gas turbine engine vehicle, designated PV-704, which proposed no central impeller or exhaust, but rather a large spinning turbo-disc directing all thrust to the outer rim. Funding enabled continued development but was insufficient for a prototype.

In 1957, the USAF provided additional funding to extend the project, by then highly classified and designated as Weapon System 606A. The concept developed was for a circular-winged, supersonic aircraft. Over 1,000 hours of wind-tunnel testing were performed. Drawings developed by Avro show an aircraft that appears to be a merging of flying saucer with more conventional fuselage shapes, in other words a tailless aircraft with circular wings (when viewed from above or below).

===Avrocar===

The Avrocar, also called the Avro &#x27;flying saucer&#x27; or Avro disc, was proposed to the U.S. Army as a type of &quot;flying Jeep&quot; that could also serve as a proof-of-concept test vehicle for a later supersonic flying saucer designs, PV-704 and Weapon System 606A. Two Avrocars were built, one for wind-tunnel testing at NASA Ames and the other for flight testing. The designs were underpowered and only operated in a ground-cushion effect, much like a hovercraft. When the Avrocar prototypes failed to perform at heights above three feet off the ground, the U.S. Army and USAF cancelled the project, in 1961.

Both Avrocars were on public display, one in Building 22 of the Smithsonian Paul E. Garber facility, the other at the U.S. Army Transportation Museum, Fort Eustis, Virginia. The latter Avrocar was dismantled and put into storage c. 2002, due to increasing deterioration (it was displayed outside, and the museum is very close to the ocean).

The curator of the U.S. Army Transportation Museum stated in 2008 that it would take between US$500,000 and US$600,000 to entirely restore it. Furthermore, because it is at a federal (military) installation, the work must be done by contractors, rather than volunteers. A grant of US$80,000 was received to begin restoration, however this amount was only enough to restore one piece approximately five ft by five ft.

===Avro STAT (SST)===

===Space Threshold Vehicle===
Developed by the Advanced Projects Group, a June 1958 report by Avro&#x27;s Engineering Department described a Space Threshold Vehicle intended to &quot;get a man into the threshold of space and recover him, flying back through the corridor&quot;, where winged flight was possible between maximum altitude that could sustain lift from a winged vehicle and maximum tolerable structural temperature. This was estimated to be an altitude of between 150,000 and 200,000 feet. The STV would have had capability for in-flight refueling, and an expected speed of 6,000 mph (Mach 8.5+).

Avro&#x27;s computer capacities provided capability in developing theories and methods similar to modern three-dimensional modeling of fluid dynamics. Avro envisioned a delta-shaped vehicle with downward winglets (similar to the TSR-2&#x27;s), varying engine nacelle positions, titanium skin, and first flight of a research vehicle in 1962. Many engineers involved in this and similar Avro designs were later heavily involved in NASA Projects Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo.

===Avroskimmer===
This group of vehicle designs were variations on what later became known as hovercraft.

* Avrocruisier
* Avrowagon
* Avroflivver
* Avro P470 Mobile Ground Effect Vehicle

===Other designs===
* Avro Canada TS-140, A Mach-2 VTOL fighter proposed to the US Navy.
* XA-20 and XA-92 Bobcat, similar to designs for later armoured tracked vehicles.
* Turbine-powered trucks, monorail transit.
* Orenda OT-4 turbine powered White 7000 transport truck with an Allison engine.
* Orenda OT-4 turbine powered M-84 Patton tank. The American M1 Abrams would be the first main battle tank in production (1980) powered by a turbine engine.
* Hydrofoil Warships: When the Arrow and related programs were terminated, 12 key engineers from this team departed for De Havilland Aircraft of Canada. to work on what became HMCS &quot;Bras d&#x27;Or&quot;, possibly the world&#x27;s fastest warship to present day (2011).

==Orenda Engines==
Founded in 1944 as crown corporation Turbo Research, it was established to conduct research and cold-weather testing of jet engines for the Royal Canadian Air Force during the World War II. Initial studies were undertaken into centrifugal-flow engine design, which later were eclipsed by a new axial-flow design, the TR.4, later known as the Chinook, the first Canadian-designed jet engine. In 1948, Turbo Research was sold to A.V. Roe Canada. and merged with its Gas Turbine Division. The Chinook was developed into the TR.5 Orenda designed for the CF-100 Canuck, but was also installed in several variants of the Canadair Sabre.

In 1954 Avro Canada was re-organized and the Gas Turbine Division became Orenda Engines. To power the CF-105 Arrow supersonic interceptor, Orenda developed the PS.13 Iroquois engine between 1953 and 1954. The Iroquois program was cancelled, along with the Arrow, on 20 February 1959. The company continued building jet engines, under licence, for the Royal Canadian Air Force from Avro and Canadair in the 1960s. In 1962, it was transferred to Hawker Siddeley Canada and continued as a major repair and overhaul business. In the 1980s Orenda was purchased by Magellan Aerospace, which is now known as Magellan Repair, Overhaul &amp; Industrial.

==Canadian Steel Improvement==
In 1951, Canadian Steel Improvement. was established. When the Korean War broke out in 1950, the Canadian Defense Production Ministry initiated establishment of a turbine and compressor blade production forge plant, with The Steel Improvement and Forge Company being the successful bidder. Plant construction and operation started in 1951 in Etobicoke, a Toronto suburb near Malton, Ontario. Steel Improvement provided the necessary technical and management expertise and the Canadian government funded construction of the plant, which was leased to Steel Improvement. In its first year, the plant produced more than a million precision forged turbine and compressor blades for Avro&#x27;s Orenda engine.

In 1954, the Canadian government decided to sell the plant and Avro Canada agreed to purchase it to maintain production of the Orenda and Iroquois engines. The company employed over 400 in the production of precision forgings, blades, jet engine components, close-tolerance forging, and operation of aluminum and magnesium foundries.

==Canadian Car &amp; Foundry==

In 1955, Canadian Car and Foundry was purchased by A.V. Roe Canada. In 1957, its foundry division was spun off as Canadian Steel Foundries. The company produced rail car rolling stock, streetcars for most large Canadian cities as well as the Brazilian cities of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, and the Canadian Car-Brill buses and trolleys. It also controlled Canadian General Transit, a supplier of railway tank cars for petroleum and chemical transport.

==DOSCO==

DOSCO was one of the largest private employers in Canada when it was purchased as a subsidiary of A.V. Roe Canada. The company was dissolved in 1968 after the majority of its coal mining and steel mill industrial assets in Industrial Cape Breton were expropriated and nationalized by the federal and provincial governments (see Sydney Steel Corporation and DEVCO). Other subsidiaries included mining, engineering, shipping, rail car manufacturing and shipbuilding:
* Halifax Shipyards
* Cumberland Railway and Coal Company
* Sydney &amp; Louisburg Railway, an historic railway in Cape Breton Island, NS.

==Canadian Applied Research==
In 1957, A.V. Roe Canada acquired PSC Applied Research, a manufacturer of flight navigation computers, and renamed it Canadian Applied Research. It was later divested by Hawker Siddeley Canada and merged with de Havilland Canada&#x27;s Special Products division to form SPAR Aerospace (Special Products and Applied Research), developer of the Canadarm remote manipulator system for the Space Shuttle. It is today a part of MacDonald Dettwiler as MD Robotics, a subsidiary of its MDA Space Missions division.

==Other subsidiaries==
* Algoma Steel, minority ownership, acquired in 1957, divested in 1958.
* Canadian Steel Wheel (Associated Company), existed from 1957 to 1975
* Canadian Thermo Control Co existed from 1957 to 1983

==Aircraft==

==Corporate demise==
In 1962, Hawker Siddeley dissolved A.V. Roe Canada and transferred all A.V. Roe Canada assets to its newly formed subsidiary Hawker Siddeley Canada. Avro Aircraft was closed.

Hawker Siddeley Canada, at that time, among its diverse holdings, included major manufacturing units:
* Canadian Car and Foundry (CC&amp;F)
* Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation (DOSCO)
* Orenda Engines

The former Avro aircraft factory in Malton was sold to de Havilland Canada in the same year. This facility located on the north end of Toronto Pearson International Airport (the village of Malton was incorporated into the City of Mississauga in 1974), was subsequently owned and operated by several others:
* Douglas Aircraft of Canada (1963–1967): manufacturer of the aircraft wings and tail sections (empennage) for the Douglas DC-9;
* McDonnell-Douglas Canada (1967–1997): manufacturer of aircraft wings and related components for the KC-10 and MD-11, MD-80 wings, empennage and cabin floors, and McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet side panels and pylons;
* Boeing Toronto (1997–2005): manufacturer of Boeing 717 wings, parts for the Delta rocket, the Boeing C-17 transport and the Boeing 737 jetliner.
By the late 1990s, Hawker Siddeley Canada had been diminished into a holding company after divesting itself of almost everything other than its pension fund. One of Hawkery Siddeley Canada&#x27;s last aerospace concerns the aircraft gas turbine repair and overhaul company Standard Aero of Winnipeg was spun off to British Tire and Rubber at the time (it is now part of Dubai Aerospace Enterprises, an international corporation with interests in aircraft leasing, MRO and aviation IT solutions).

DOSCO&#x27;s assets were nationalized to become DEVCO and SYSCO. CC&amp;F closed its operations and the plants demolished. CC&amp;F&#x27;s Thunder Bay plant, after several changes of ownership, is now part of Bombardier Aerospace.

Orenda Aerospace, as part of the Magellan Aerospace Corporation, is the only remaining original company from the A.V. Roe empire, although greatly diminished in both the size and scope of its operations.

In mid-2005, with the completion of the last shipset of Boeing 717 wings, The Boeing Company discontinued its operations at the former Avro plant.

The Malton plant, which had comprised several very large buildings and hangar-like structures, was demolished in progressive stages from 2004 onwards. The approximate of land that the plant resided on at the time of its closure was sold to the Greater Toronto Airports Authority (owner of the Toronto Pearson International Airport) and the title was transferred after the property site had completed its environmental soil remediation.

Some of the brickwork of the site&#x27;s historic main &quot;C&quot; assembly building, next to the high-bay doors that the Arrow, Jetliner, CF-100 and thousands of other aircraft and major assemblies emerged from, was retained by the former Canadian Air and Space Museum in Downsview, Toronto, for future use alongside a number of their Avro displays, which include a full-scale replica of the CF-105 Arrow.

<text>Publius Papinius Statius (Greek: Πόπλιος Παπίνιος Στάτιος; , ; ) was a Latin poet of the 1st century CE. His surviving poetry includes an epic in twelve books, the &quot;Thebaid&quot;; a collection of occasional poetry, the &quot;Silvae&quot;; and an unfinished epic, the &quot;Achilleid&quot;. He is also known for his appearance as a guide in the &quot;Purgatory&quot; section of Dante&#x27;s epic poem, the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;.

==Life==
===Family background===
The poet&#x27;s father (whose name is unknown) was a native of Velia but later moved to Naples and spent time in Rome where he taught with marked success. From boyhood to adulthood, Statius&#x27;s father proved himself a champion in the poetic contests at Naples in the Augustalia and in the Nemean, Pythian, and Isthmian games, which served as important events to display poetic skill during the early empire. Statius declares in his lament for his father (&quot;Silv.&quot; 5.3) that his father was in his time equal to any literary task, whether in prose or verse. He mentioned Mevania, and may have spent time there, or been impressed by the confrontation of Vitellius and Vespasian in 69. Statius&#x27;s father was a Roman &quot;eques&quot;, but may have lost his status because of money troubles. At Naples, he was a teacher of Greek and Roman literature who attracted many pupils who were destined for religious offices in Rome. He died in 79 AD. From Pliny the Younger&#x27;s Letters, it has recently been deduced that Statius also wrote under the pseudonym of Propertius.

===Birth and career=== 
Less is known of the biography of Statius. Born 45 CE, he grew up in the Greek cultural milieu of the Bay of Naples, and his Greek literary education lends a sophisticated veneer to his ornamental verse. From his boyhood he won several poetic contests at his native Naples and three times at the Alban Festival, where he received the golden crown from the hand of the emperor Domitian, who had instituted the contest. For the Alban Festival, Statius composed a poem on the German and Dacian campaigns of Domitian - which Juvenal lampoons in his seventh satire. Statius is thought to have moved to Rome after his father&#x27;s death in 79; there he published his acclaimed epic poem the &quot;Thebaid&quot; (). In the capital, Statius seems to have made many connections among the Roman aristocracy and court, and he was probably supported through their patronage. Statius produced the first three books of occasional poetry, his &quot;Silvae&quot;, which were published in 93, and which sketch his patrons and acquaintances of this period and mention his attendance at one of Domitian&#x27;s Saturnalia banquets. He competed in the great Capitoline competition -
it is not known in what year, although 94 has been suggested. Statius failed to win the coveted prize, a loss he took very hard. The disappointment may have prompted his return () to Naples, the home of his youth. There survives a poem he addressed on this occasion to his wife, Claudia (the widow of a famous singer) who had a musically talented daughter by her first husband, (&quot;Silv.&quot; 3.5).

===Later years at Naples===
Statius&#x27;s first three books of the &quot;Silvae&quot; seem to have received some criticism, and in response he composed a fourth book&#x27; at Naples, which was published in 95. During this period at Naples, Statius maintained his relations with the court and his patrons, earning himself another invitation to a palace banquet (&quot;Silv.&quot; 4.2). He seems to have taken an interest in the marriage and career of his stepdaughter and, being childless, he also took under his wing a young slave boy, who died c. 95. In that same year Statius embarked on a new epic, the &quot;Achilleid&quot;, giving popular recitations of his work (Juv. 7.83) only to complete a book and a half before dying in 95, leaving the poem unfinished. His fifth book of &quot;Silvae&quot; were published after his death c. 96.

==Works==
As a poet, Statius was versatile in his abilities and contrived to represent his work as &quot;otium&quot;. Taught by his educated father, Statius was familiar with the breadth of classical literature and displayed his learning in his poetry which is densely allusive and has been described as elaborate and mannerist. He was able to compose in hexameter, hendecasyllable, Alcaic, and Sapphic meters, to produce deeply researched and highly refined epic and polished impromptu pieces, and to treat a variety of themes with the dazzling rhetorical and poetic skill that inspired the support of his patrons and the emperor. Some of Statius&#x27;s works, such as his poems for his competitions, have been lost; he is recorded as having written an &quot;Agave&quot; mime, and a four line fragment remains of his poem on Domitian&#x27;s military campaigns, the &quot;De Bello Germanico&quot; composed for the Alban Games in the scholia to Juvenal 4.94.

===The &quot;Thebaid&quot;===
Based on Statius&#x27;s own testimony, the &quot;Thebaid&quot; was written between c. 80 and 92, beginning when the poet was around 35, and the work is thought to have been published in 91 or 92. The poem is divided into twelve books in imitation of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; and is composed in dactylic hexameter. In the &quot;Silvae&quot;, Statius speaks of his extensive work in polishing and revising the &quot;Thebaid&quot; and his public recitations of the poem. From the epilogue it seems clear that Statius considered the &quot;Thebaid&quot; to be his &quot;magnum opus&quot; and believed that it would secure him fame for the future. In the poem, Statius follows Virgil closely as a model (in the epilogue he acknowledges his debt to Virgil), but he also refers to a wide range of sources in his handling of meter and episodes.
The poem&#x27;s theme is the myth of the Seven against Thebes, the story of the battle between the sons of Oedipus for the throne of Thebes. The poem opens (Book 1) with the disgraced Oedipus&#x27; curse on his two sons, Eteocles and Polyneices, who have decided to hold the throne of Thebes in alternate years, one ruling, the other in exile. Jupiter plans a war between Thebes and Argos, although Juno begs him not to incite it. Polyneices in exile fights with Tydeus, another exile at Adrastus&#x27; palace; the two are entertained and marry Adrastus&#x27; daughters. In Book 2, Tydeus goes to Eteocles to ask him to lay down the throne and yield power, but he refuses and tries to kill Tydeus with an ambush. Tydeus slaughters the Thebans and escapes to Argos, causing Adrastus and Polyneices to declare war on Thebes (Book 3). In the fourth book the Argive forces gather, commanded by the seven champions Adrastus, Polyneices, Amphiaraus, Capaneus, Parthenopaeus, Hippomedon, and Tydeus, and march to Thebes, but at Nemea, Bacchus causes a drought. The army meets Hypsipyle who shows them a spring then tells them the story of the Women of Lemnos (Book 5). While she is speaking, her ward, Opheltes, is killed by a snake; in Book 6, the Argives perform games for the dead child, instituting the Nemean Games. In 7, Jupiter urges the Argives to march on Thebes where battle breaks out during which Amphiaraus is swallowed in the earth. In 8, Tydeus, wounded and dying, kills Melanippus and eats his head; a battle over his body leads to the death of Hippomedon and Parthenopaeus (Book 9). In 10, Juno causes sleep to overcome the Thebans and the Argives slaughter many in the camp; Menoeceus sacrifices himself to save Thebes and Jupiter kills the wicked Capaneus with a thunderbolt. In 11, Polyneices and Eteocles join in single combat and kill each other; Jocasta kills herself and Creon assumes power, forbidding burial of the Argive dead. In the final book, the Argive widows go to Athens to ask Theseus to force Creon to allow their husbands&#x27; burial while Argia, Polyneices&#x27;s wife, burns him illicitly. Theseus musters an army and kills Creon. The &quot;Thebaid&quot; ends with an epilogue in which the poet prays that his poem will be successful, cautions it not to rival the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, and hopes that his fame will outlive him.

Modern critics of the &quot;Thebaid&quot; have been divided over interpretations of the epic&#x27;s tone. Earlier critics in the 19th and 20th century considered the poem a piece of elaborate flattery that vindicated the regime of Domitian; however, more recent scholars have viewed the poem as a subversive work that criticizes the authoritarianism and violence of the Flavians by focusing on extreme violence and social chaos. Statius&#x27; use of allegory in the &quot;Thebaid&quot; and his abstract treatment of the gods has been seen as an important innovation in the tradition of classical poetry which ushered in Medieval conventions. Finally, although earlier scholars criticized the style of the poem as episodic, current scholars have noted the subtlety and skill with which Statius organizes and controls his narrative and description. Other topics discussed in the scholarship on the Thebaid are the pervasive role of madness (furor), time, or the family.

===The &quot;Silvae&quot;===
The &quot;Silvae&quot; were probably composed by Statius between 89 and 96. The first three books seem to have been published together after 93, Book 4 was probably released in 95, and Book 5 is thought to have been released posthumously in c. 96. The title of the collection (&quot;silvae&quot; meaning &quot;forest&quot; or &quot;raw material&quot;) was used to describe the draft of a poet&#x27;s work which was composed impromptu in a moment of strong inspiration and which was then revised into a polished, metrical poem. This suggests that the &quot;Silvae&quot; are revised, impromptu pieces of occasional poetry which were composed in the space of a few days&#x27; time. There are thirty-two poems in the collection (almost all with a dedicatee), divided into five books, each with a dedicatory epistle. Of nearly four thousand lines which the books contain, more than five-sixths are hexameters. Four of the pieces are written in the hendecasyllabic metre, and there is one Alcaic and one Sapphic ode.
Subjects of the &quot;Silvae&quot; vary widely. Five poems are devoted to the emperor and his favorites, including a description of Domitian&#x27;s equestrian statue in the Forum (1.1), praise for his construction of the Via Domitiana (4.3), and a poem on the dedication of the hair of Earinus, a eunuch favorite of Domitian&#x27;s, to a shrine of Aesculapius (3.4). Six are lamentations for deaths or consolations to survivors, including the highly personal poems on the death of Statius&#x27;s father and his foster-son (5.3,5). The poems on loss are particularly notable in the collection and range from consolations on the death of wives (3.3) to pieces on the death of a favorite parrot (2.4) and a lion in the arena (2.5). Another group of the &quot;Silvae&quot; give picturesque descriptions of the villas, gardens, and artworks of the poet&#x27;s friends. In these we have a more vivid representation than elsewhere of the surroundings Roman aristocrats of the empire lived in the country. Important examples include a piece on Pollius&#x27;s temple to Hercules (3.1), the aetiology of the tree at Atedius&#x27; villa (2.3), an antique statue of Lysippus&#x27;s Heracles (4.6) and a description of Pollius&#x27; villa at Surrentum (2.2). The rest of the &quot;Silvae&quot; consist of congratulatory addresses to friends, and poems for special occasions such as the wedding poem for Stella and Violentilla (2.2), the poem commemorating the poet Lucan&#x27;s birthday (2.7), and a joking piece to Plotius Grypus on a Saturnalia gift (4.9).

As with the &quot;Thebaid&quot;, Statius&#x27;s relationship to Domitian and his court caused him to fall out of favor with critics and readers, but in recent times, the &quot;Silvae&quot; have been rehabilitated by scholars. Domitian is an important presence in the &quot;Silvae&quot;, and many of the poems appear to flatter the emperor and court. The content of the &quot;Silvae&quot; is primarily dictated by the needs of Statius&#x27;s patrons, and many of the addressees come from the wealthy, privileged class of landowners and politicians. Statius&#x27;s flattery of these elites has been interpreted in two ways by scholars; some maintain that the collection is highly subversive and is a subtle criticism of Domitian and the Roman aristocracy. Others urge a reading of the &quot;Silvae&quot; as individual pieces that respond to specific circumstances with their own unique viewpoints.

===The &quot;Achilleid&quot;===
A fragment of his epic poem on the life of Achilles—the &quot;Achilleid&quot;—is also extant, consisting of one book and a few hundred lines of a second. What was completed of this poem was composed between 94 and 95 based on &quot;Silvae&quot; 4.7.21ff. Statius records that there were recitations of the poem. It is thought that Statius&#x27; death in 95 is the reason that the poem remains unfinished. In the first book, Thetis, having foreknowledge of her son&#x27;s death in the Trojan War, attempts to hide Achilles on the island of Scyros by dressing him up as a girl. On the island, Achilles falls in love with Deidamia and forces her to have sex with him. Ulysses arrives to recruit Achilles for the war effort and reveals his identity. In the second book, Ulysses and Achilles depart and Achilles gives an account of his early life and tutelage by the centaur Chiron. The poem breaks off at the end of his speech. In general, scholars have remarked on the markedly different tone of the &quot;Achilleid&quot; in comparison with the &quot;Thebaid&quot;, equating it more to the style of Ovid than Virgil. Some have also noted the predominance of feminine themes and feminine power in the fragment and focus on the poem&#x27;s perspectives on gender relations.

==Statius&#x27;s influence and literary afterlife==
Statius&#x27;s poetry was very popular in his lifetime, although he was not without his critics who apparently had problems with his &quot;ex tempore&quot; style. Juvenal is thought to extensively lampoon Statius&#x27;s type of court poetry in his fourth satire on the turbot of Domitian, but he also mentions the immense popularity of Statius&#x27;s recitations in Satire 7.82ff. In late antiquity, the &quot;Thebaid&quot;, which was by then a classic, received a commentary by a Lactantius Placidus.

Throughout the Middle Ages, the &quot;Thebaid&quot; remained a popular text, inspiring a 12th-century French romance as well as works by Boccaccio and Chaucer. Statius&#x27;s development of allegory helped establish the importance of that technique in medieval poetry. In the Renaissance, the &quot;Silvae,&quot; thanks to Poliziano, helped inspire an entire genre of collections of miscellaneous, occasional poetry called &quot;Sylvae&quot; which remained popular throughout the period, inspiring works by Hugo Grotius and John Dryden. Dante mentions Statius in &quot;De vulgari eloquentia&quot; along with Ovid, Virgil and Lucan as one of the four &quot;regulati poetae&quot; (ii, vi, 7). 

=== Statius in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; ===

==== Statius as a character in &quot;Purgatorio&quot; ====
In the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, Dante and Virgil meet Statius as they leave the fifth terrace in Purgatorio (reserved for the avaricious and the prodigal) and enter the sixth terrace (reserved for the gluttonous). Statius&#x27;s redemption is heard in &quot;Purgatorio&quot; 20, when the mountain of Purgatory trembles and the penitent souls cry out the hymn &quot;Gloria in excelsis Deo&quot;. Statius joins Dante and Virgil, as indicated in &quot;Purgatorio&quot; 21. Statius ascends Mount Purgatory with Dante and Virgil, and he stays with Dante in the Earthly Paradise at the mountain&#x27;s summit, after Virgil has returned to Limbo. Statius is last mentioned in &quot;Purgatorio&quot; 33. Although Statius plays a small role after the disappearance of Virgil, his presence in accompanying Dante through Earthly Paradise until the rivers of Lethe and Eunoe serves an important role in the plot line of the &quot;Comedy&quot;, as it underscores Statius&#x27;s significant difference from Virgil. This is because Dante&#x27;s Statius, a Christian poet who drew inspiration from Virgil, represents a model of the &quot;new vernacular Christian Dante-poeta&quot; in Dante&#x27;s journey in the &quot;Comedy&quot; as a protagonist.

Statius&#x27;s arrival in &quot;Purgatorio&quot; 20 is often compared to Jesus&#x27; appearance to the disciples after the Resurrection as narrated by Luke 24:13–16. Scholars have also paralleled Virgil&#x27;s and Statius&#x27;s relationship to that of John the Baptist and Jesus: John the Baptist precedes Jesus and formally baptizes him. In &quot;Inferno&quot;, Virgil alludes to Christ&#x27;s Harrowing of Hell, through which John the Baptist is freed from Limbo. In the same spirit, Statius cites Virgil&#x27;s poems as the reason for his conversion to Christianity. In particular, Statius was saved from the vice of prodigality by reading Virgil&#x27;s condemnation of this particular vice in a passage of the &quot;Aeneid&quot; (&quot;Aeneid&quot; 3.56–57), and that he found reason for converting to Christianity while reading a passage from Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Eclogues&quot; (Eclogue 4.5–7). Statius recounts to Virgil that, &quot;through you I was a poet, through you a Christian&quot; (&quot;per te poeta fui, per te cristiano&quot;, &quot;Purg&quot;. 22.73). Statius&#x27; relationship with Virgil highlights the tragedy of Virgil, who may beget salvation, but cannot attain it.

Though Statius converted to Christianity, he states that he kept his Christianity a secret (&quot;Purg&quot;. 22.90) as he lived at a time where Christians were persecuted, which resulted him spending four centuries in the fourth terrace of Purgatory, where the vice of sloth is cleansed.

Dante presents Statius as the author of &quot;Thebaid&quot; and &quot;Achilleid&quot; and as someone who has a great admiration for Virgil. Statius remarks that Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; &quot;was my mama and my nurse&quot; (&quot;Purg&quot;. 21.98) to express Virgil as his inspiration. In &quot;Purgatorio&quot;, when Dante reveals Virgil&#x27;s identity to Statius, Statius makes a failed attempt to embrace Virgil, which parallels with Aeneas&#x27;s failed attempt to embrace the shade of his father Anchises in &quot;Aeneid&quot; 6.700–2. Dante also adds inventive details about Statius&#x27;s life to fit with the narrative of the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. In addition to being a foil for Virgil, Dante&#x27;s creative freedom allows him to establish Statius as a reflection of himself. Both Statius&#x27;s and Dante&#x27;s salvation is facilitated by Virgil. Statius&#x27;s conversations with Virgil parallel Dante&#x27;s conversations with Virgil. For example, Statius asks Virgil where the poets Terence, Caecilius, Plautus and Lucius Varius are. Both Dante and Statius are curious about the souls in Hell and look to Virgil as a mentor.

Furthermore, Dante&#x27;s inventive portrayal of Statius embodies three elements of conversion important for the &quot;Comedy&quot;″s tropology of exile. First, his conversion to Christianity symbolizes exodus as humanity was redeemed through Christ. Second, his aversion of vice exemplifies the soul&#x27;s conversion from sin to grace. Third, his completion of cleansing in &quot;Purgatorio&quot; allegorizes the soul&#x27;s exodus from servitude to eternal glory. In addition, the idea that Virgil was the reason for his conversion simulates how Virgil was a rescuer for Dante in the first canto of &quot;Inferno&quot;. However, though Statius&#x27;s conversion to Christianity is a key positive element in the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, it is also a &quot;negative exemplum&quot; to Dante. This is because Statius shunned from publicly revealing his Christianity, contrary to Dante, who publicly writes about his faith in the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;.

====Influence of works by Statius on the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;====

In addition to Statius himself, characters drawn from his works are also found in the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. Argia, who was a character in Statius&#x27; &quot;Thebaid&quot; and wife of Polynices, is referred to in the line &quot;of your people&quot; (&quot;de le genti tue&quot;) in &quot;Purg&quot;. 22 109–110. Dante considers her to be a noble woman, placing her among the virtuous pagans in Limbo. Capaneus, who is at the center of the &quot;Thebaid&quot;″s tragic theme, is placed in the third ring of the seventh circle of Dis, where those who committed sins of violence against the God are condemned. However, Statius&#x27; Capaneus is represented as a heroic character, whereas in the &quot;Comedy&quot; his only attributes are physical strength and a failure to accept God&#x27;s divine power.

<text>Decimius Magnus Ausonius (; ) was a Roman poet and teacher of rhetoric from Burdigala, Aquitaine (now Bordeaux, France). For a time, he was tutor to the future Emperor Gratian, who afterwards bestowed the consulship on him. His best-known poems are &quot;Mosella&quot;, a description of the River Moselle, and &quot;Ephemeris&quot;, an account of a typical day in his life. His many other verses show his concern for his family, friends, teachers and circle of well-to-do acquaintances and his delight in the technical handling of meter.

==Biography==
Decimius Magnus Ausonius was born in Burdigala (now Bordeaux), the son of Julius Ausonius (378), a physician of Greek ancestry, and Aemilia Aeonia, daughter of Caecilius Argicius Arborius, descended on both sides from established, land-owning Gallo-Roman families of southwestern Gaul.

Ausonius was given a strict upbringing by his aunt and grandmother, both named Aemilia. He received an excellent education at Bordeaux and at Toulouse, where his maternal uncle, Aemilius Magnus Arborius, was a professor. Ausonius did well in grammar and rhetoric, but professed that his progress in Greek was unsatisfactory. In 328 Arborius was summoned to Constantinople to become tutor to Constans, the youngest son of Constantine the Great, whereupon Ausonius returned to Bordeaux to complete his education under the rhetorician Minervius Alcimus. He had a sister, Dryadia, who lived to 60, a sister Aemilia Melania, who died in infancy, as well as a younger brother Avitianus, who died before reaching puberty, whom Ausonius laments in his &quot;Parentalia&quot;.

Having completed his studies, he trained for some time as an advocate, but he preferred teaching. In 334 he became a &quot;grammaticus&quot; (instructor) at a school of rhetoric in Bordeaux and afterwards a &quot;rhetor&quot; or professor. His teaching attracted many pupils, some of whom became eminent in public life. His most famous pupil was the poet Paulinus, who later became a Christian and Bishop of Nola.

After thirty years of that work, Ausonius was summoned by Emperor Valentinian I to teach his son, Gratian, the heir-apparent. When Valentinian took Gratian on the German campaigns of 368–369, Ausonius accompanied them. Ausonius turned literary skill into political capital. In recognition of his services emperor Valentinian bestowed on Ausonius the rank of quaestor. His presence at court gave Ausonius the opportunity to connect with a number of influential people. In 369, he met Quintus Aurelius Symmachus; their friendship proved mutually beneficial.

Gratian liked and respected his tutor, and when he became emperor in 375, he began bestowing on Ausonius and his family the highest civil honors. That year Ausonius was made Praetorian Prefect of Gaul, campaigned against the Alemanni and received as part of his booty a slave girl, Bissula (to whom he addressed a poem), and his father, though nearly ninety years old, was given the rank of prefect of Illyricum.

In 376 Ausonius&#x27;s son, Hesperius, was made proconsul of Africa. In 379 Ausonius was awarded the consulate, the highest Roman honour.

In 383, the army of Britain, led by Magnus Maximus, revolted against Gratian and assassinated him at Lyons; and when Emperor Valentinian II was driven out of Italy, Ausonius retired to his estates near Burdigala (now Bordeaux), in Gaul. Magnus Maximus was overthrown by Emperor Theodosius I in 388, but Ausonius did not leave his country estates. They were, he says, his &quot;nidus senectutis&quot;, the &quot;nest of his old age&quot;, and there, he spent the rest of his days, composing poetry and writing to many eminent contemporaries, several of whom had been his pupils. His estates supposedly included the land now owned by Château Ausone, which takes its name from him.

Ausonius appears to have been a late and perhaps not very enthusiastic convert to Christianity. He died about 395.

His grandson, Paulinus of Pella, was also a poet. His works attest to the devastation that Ausonius&#x27;s Gaul would face soon after his death.

==List of works==
* &quot;Epigrammata Ausonii de diversis rebus&quot;. About 120 epigrams on various topics.
* &quot;Ephemeris&quot;. A description of the occupations of the day from morning to evening, in various meters, composed before 367. Only the beginning and the end are preserved.
* &quot;Parentalia&quot;. 30 poems of various lengths, mostly in elegiac meter, on deceased relations that were composed after his consulate, when he had already been a widower for 36 years.
* &quot;Commemoratio professorum Burdigalensium&quot; or &quot;Professores&quot;. A continuation of the &quot;Parentalia&quot;, dealing with the famous teachers of his native Bordeaux whom he had known.
* &quot;Epitaphia&quot;. 26 epitaphs of heroes from the Trojan War translated from Greek
* &quot;Caesares&quot;. On the 12 emperors described by Suetonius.
* &quot;Ordo urbium nobilium&quot;. 14 pieces, dealing with 17 towns (Rome to Bordeaux), in hexameters, and composed after the downfall of Maximus in 388.
* &quot;Ludus VII Sapientium&quot;. A kind of puppet play in which the seven wise men appear successively and have their say.
* The so-called &quot;Idyllia&quot;. 20 pieces are grouped under this arbitrary title, the most famous of which is the &quot;Mosella&quot;. It also includes:
** &quot;Griphus ternarii numeri&quot;
** &quot;De aetatibus Hesiodon&quot;
** &quot;Monosticha de aerumnis Herculis&quot;
** &quot;De ambiguitate eligendae vitae&quot; 
** &quot;De viro bono&quot;

** &quot;De rosis nascentibus&quot; (dubious)
** &quot;Versus paschales&quot;

** &quot;Genethliacon&quot;
* &quot;Eglogarum liber&quot;. A collection of all kinds of astronomical and astrological versifications in epic and elegiac meter.
* &quot;Epistolarum liber&quot;. 25 verse letters in various meters.
* &quot;Ad Gratianum gratiarum actio pro consulatu&quot;. Prose speech of thanks to the emperor Gratian on the occasion of attaining the consulship, delivered at Treves in 379.
* &quot;Periochae Homeri Iliadis et Odyssiae&quot;. A prose summary of Homer&#x27;s Iliad and Odyssey, attributed to but probably not written by Ausonius.
* &quot;Praefatiunculae&quot;. Prefaces by the poet to various collections of his poems, including a response to the emperor Theodosius I&#x27;s request for his poems.

==Characteristics of works==
Although admired by his contemporaries, the writings of Ausonius have not since been ranked among Latin literature&#x27;s finest. His style is easy and fluent, and his &quot;Mosella&quot; is appreciated for its evocation of the life and the country along the River Moselle, but he is considered derivative and unoriginal. Edward Gibbon pronounced in his &quot;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; that &quot;the poetical fame of Ausonius condemns the taste of his age&quot;. However, Ausonius&#x27;s works have several points of interest:

* His references to winemaking are frequently cited by historians as early evidence of large-scale viticulture in the now-famous wine country around his native Bordeaux.
* His contribution to the &quot;carpe diem&quot; topic (if the following poem is indeed his):
* His somewhat unique &quot;Cento Nuptialis&quot;, in which he fulfils an imperial commission to compose an epithalamium using the &quot;love is war&quot; trope by writing it in the form of a cento (in other words, a ) lifting lines from Vergil:
==Saw mill==

His writings are also remarkable for mentioning in passing the working of a water mill sawing marble on a tributary of the Moselle:

The excerpt sheds new light on the development of Roman technology in using water power for different applications. It is one of the rare references in Roman literature to water mills used to cut stone, but that is a logical consequence of the application of water power to mechanical sawing of stone and presumably wood also. Earlier references to the widespread use of mills occur in Vitruvius in his &quot;De Architectura&quot; of , and the &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot; of Pliny the Elder published in 77 AD. Such applications of mills would multiply after the fall of the empire through the Middle Ages into the modern era. The mills at Barbegal, in southern France, are famous for their application of water power to grinding grain to make flour and were built in the 1st century AD. They consisted of 16 mills in a parallel sequence on a hill near Arles.

The construction of a saw mill is even simpler than a flour or grinding mill since no gearing is needed, and the rotary saw blade can be driven directly from the water wheel axle, as the example of Sutter&#x27;s Mill, California, shows. However, a different mechanism is shown by the sawmill at Hieropolis, Asia Minor, involving a frame saw that is operated by a crank and connecting rod.

<doc id="80464" wikidata="Q1620670" url="?curid=80464" title="Wavelength-division multiplexing">
<text>In fiber-optic communications, wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) is a technology which multiplexes a number of optical carrier signals onto a single optical fiber by using different wavelengths (i.e., colors) of laser light. This technique enables bidirectional communications over a single strand of fiber (also called wavelength-division duplexing) as well as multiplication of capacity.

The term WDM is commonly applied to an optical carrier, which is typically described by its wavelength, whereas frequency-division multiplexing typically applies to a radio carrier, more often described by frequency. This is purely conventional because wavelength and frequency communicate the same information. Specifically, frequency (in Hertz, which is cycles per second) multiplied by wavelength (the physical length of one cycle) equals velocity of the carrier wave. In a vacuum, this is the speed of light (usually denoted by the lowercase letter, c). In glass fiber, velocity is substantially slower - usually about 0.7 times c. The data rate in practical systems is a fraction of the carrier frequency.

==Systems==
A WDM system uses a multiplexer at the transmitter to join the several signals together and a demultiplexer at the receiver to split them apart. With the right type of fiber, it is possible to have a device that does both simultaneously and can function as an optical add-drop multiplexer. The optical filtering devices used have conventionally been etalons (stable solid-state single-frequency Fabry–Pérot interferometers in the form of thin-film-coated optical glass). As there are three different WDM types, whereof one is called &quot;WDM&quot;, the notation &quot;xWDM&quot; is normally used when discussing the technology as such.

The concept was first published in 1970 by Delange, and by 1980 WDM systems were being realized in the laboratory. The first WDM systems combined only two signals. Modern systems can handle 160 signals and can thus expand a basic system over a single fiber pair to over . A system of 320 channels is also present (12.5 GHz channel spacing, see below.)

WDM systems are popular with telecommunications companies because they allow them to expand the capacity of the network without laying more fiber. By using WDM and optical amplifiers, they can accommodate several generations of technology development in their optical infrastructure without having to overhaul the backbone network. The capacity of a given link can be expanded simply by upgrading the multiplexers and demultiplexers at each end.

This is often done by the use of optical-to-electrical-to-optical (O/E/O) translation at the very edge of the transport network, thus permitting interoperation with existing equipment with optical interfaces.

Most WDM systems operate on single-mode optical fiber cables which have a core diameter of 9 μm. Certain forms of WDM can also be used in multi-mode optical fiber cables (also known as premises cables) which have core diameters of 50 or 62.5 μm.

Early WDM systems were expensive and complicated to run. However, recent standardization and a better understanding of the dynamics of WDM systems have made WDM less expensive to deploy.

Optical receivers, in contrast to laser sources, tend to be wideband devices. Therefore, the demultiplexer must provide the wavelength selectivity of the receiver in the WDM system.

WDM systems are divided into three different wavelength patterns: normal (WDM), coarse (CWDM) and dense (DWDM). Normal WDM (sometimes called BWDM) uses the two normal wavelengths 1310 and 1550 nm on one fiber. Coarse WDM provides up to 16 channels across multiple transmission windows of silica fibers. &quot;Dense WDM&quot; (DWDM) uses the C-Band (1530 nm-1565 nm) transmission window but with denser channel spacing. Channel plans vary, but a typical DWDM system would use 40 channels at 100 GHz spacing or 80 channels with 50 GHz spacing. Some technologies are capable of 12.5 GHz spacing (sometimes called ultra-dense WDM). New amplification options (Raman amplification) enable the extension of the usable wavelengths to the L-band (1565–1625 nm), more or less doubling these numbers.

Coarse wavelength-division multiplexing (CWDM), in contrast to DWDM, uses increased channel spacing to allow less sophisticated and thus cheaper transceiver designs. To provide 16 channels on a single fiber, CWDM uses the entire frequency band spanning the second and third transmission windows (1310/1550 nm respectively) including the critical frequencies where OH scattering may occur. OH-free silica fibers are recommended if the wavelengths between the second and third transmission windows are to be used. Avoiding this region, the channels 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61 remain and these are the most commonly used. With OS2 fibers the water peak problem is overcome, and all possible 18 channels can be used.

WDM, CWDM and DWDM are based on the same concept of using multiple wavelengths of light on a single fiber but differ in the spacing of the wavelengths, number of channels, and the ability to amplify the multiplexed signals in the optical space. EDFA provide an efficient wideband amplification for the C-band, Raman amplification adds a mechanism for amplification in the L-band. For CWDM, wideband optical amplification is not available, limiting the optical spans to several tens of kilometers.

==Coarse WDM==

Originally, the term &quot;coarse wavelength-division multiplexing&quot; (CWDM) was fairly generic and described a number of different channel configurations. In general, the choice of channel spacings and frequency in these configurations precluded the use of erbium doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs). Prior to the relatively recent ITU standardization of the term, one common definition for CWDM was two or more signals multiplexed onto a single fiber, with one signal in the 1550 nm band and the other in the 1310 nm band.

In 2002, the ITU standardized a channel spacing grid for CWDM (ITU-T G.694.2) using the wavelengths from 1270 nm through 1610 nm with a channel spacing of 20 nm. ITU G.694.2 was revised in 2003 to shift the channel centers by 1 nm so, strictly speaking, the center wavelengths are 1271 to 1611 nm. Many CWDM wavelengths below 1470 nm are considered unusable on older G.652 specification fibers, due to the increased attenuation in the 1270–1470 nm bands. Newer fibers which conform to the G.652.C and G.652.D standards, such as Corning SMF-28e and Samsung Widepass, nearly eliminate the water-related attenuation peak at 1383 nm and allow for full operation of all 18 ITU CWDM channels in metropolitan networks.

The main characteristic of the recent ITU CWDM standard is that the signals are not spaced appropriately for amplification by EDFAs. This limits the total CWDM optical span to somewhere near 60 km for a signal, suitable for use in metropolitan applications. The relaxed optical frequency stabilization requirements allow the associated costs of CWDM to approach those of non-WDM optical components.

===CWDM Applications===
CWDM is being used in cable television networks, where different wavelengths are used for the &quot;downstream&quot; and &quot;upstream&quot; signals. In these systems, the wavelengths used are often widely separated. For example, the downstream signal might be at 1310 nm while the upstream signal is at 1550 nm.

The 10GBASE-LX4 physical layer standard is an example of a CWDM system in which four wavelengths near 1310 nm, each carrying a data stream, are used to carry of aggregate data.

Passive CWDM is an implementation of CWDM that uses no electrical power. It separates the wavelengths using passive optical components such as bandpass filters and prisms. Many manufacturers are promoting passive CWDM to deploy fiber to the home.

==Dense WDM==
&quot;Dense wavelength-division multiplexing&quot; (DWDM) refers originally to optical signals multiplexed within the 1550 nm band so as to leverage the capabilities (and cost) of erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs), which are effective for wavelengths between approximately 1525–1565 nm (C band), or 1570–1610 nm (L band). EDFAs were originally developed to replace SONET/SDH optical-electrical-optical (OEO) regenerators, which they have made practically obsolete. EDFAs can amplify any optical signal in their operating range, regardless of the modulated bit rate. In terms of multi-wavelength signals, so long as the EDFA has enough pump energy available to it, it can amplify as many optical signals as can be multiplexed into its amplification band (though signal densities are limited by choice of modulation format). EDFAs therefore allow a single-channel optical link to be upgraded in bit rate by replacing only equipment at the ends of the link, while retaining the existing EDFA or series of EDFAs through a long haul route. Furthermore, single-wavelength links using EDFAs can similarly be upgraded to WDM links at reasonable cost. The EDFA&#x27;s cost is thus leveraged across as many channels as can be multiplexed into the 1550 nm band.

===DWDM systems===
At this stage, a basic DWDM system contains several main components:
# A DWDM terminal multiplexer. The terminal multiplexer contains a wavelength-converting transponder for each data signal, an optical multiplexer and where necessary an optical amplifier (EDFA). Each wavelength-converting transponder receives an optical data signal from the client layer, such as SONET/SDH or another type of data signal, converts this signal into the electrical domain, and re-transmits the signal at a specific wavelength using a 1,550 nm band laser. These data signals are then combined into a multi-wavelength optical signal using an optical multiplexer, for transmission over a single fiber (e.g., SMF-28 fiber). The terminal multiplexer may or may not also include a local transmit EDFA for power amplification of the multi-wavelength optical signal. In the mid-1990s DWDM systems contained 4 or 8 wavelength-converting transponders; by 2000 or so, commercial systems capable of carrying 128 signals were available. 
# An intermediate line repeater is placed approximately every 80–100 km to compensate for the loss of optical power as the signal travels along the fiber. The &#x27;multi-wavelength optical signal&#x27; is amplified by an EDFA, which usually consists of several amplifier stages.
# An intermediate optical terminal, or optical add-drop multiplexer (OADM). This is a remote amplification site that amplifies the multi-wavelength signal that may have traversed up to 140 km or more before reaching the remote site. Optical diagnostics and telemetry are often extracted or inserted at such a site, to allow for localization of any fiber breaks or signal impairments. In more sophisticated systems (which are no longer point-to-point), several signals out of the multi-wavelength optical signal may be removed and dropped locally.
# A DWDM terminal demultiplexer. At the remote site, the terminal de-multiplexer consisting of an optical de-multiplexer and one or more wavelength-converting transponders separates the multi-wavelength optical signal back into individual data signals and outputs them on separate fibers for client-layer systems (such as SONET/SDH). Originally, this de-multiplexing was performed entirely passively, except for some telemetry, as most SONET systems can receive 1,550 nm signals. However, in order to allow for transmission to remote client-layer systems (and to allow for digital domain signal integrity determination) such de-multiplexed signals are usually sent to O/E/O output transponders prior to being relayed to their client-layer systems. Often, the functionality of output transponder has been integrated into that of input transponder, so that most commercial systems have transponders that support bi-directional interfaces on both their 1,550 nm (i.e., internal) side, and external (i.e., client-facing) side. Transponders in some systems supporting 40 GHz nominal operation may also perform forward error correction (FEC) via digital wrapper technology, as described in the ITU-T G.709 standard.
# Optical Supervisory Channel (OSC). This is data channel that uses an additional wavelength usually outside the EDFA amplification band (at 1,510 nm, 1,620 nm, 1,310 nm or another proprietary wavelength). The OSC carries information about the multi-wavelength optical signal as well as remote conditions at the optical terminal or EDFA site. It is also normally used for remote software upgrades and user (i.e., network operator) Network Management information. It is the multi-wavelength analog to SONET&#x27;s DCC (or supervisory channel). ITU standards suggest that the OSC should utilize an OC-3 signal structure, though some vendors have opted to use Fast Ethernet or another signal format. Unlike the 1550 nm multi-wavelength signal containing client data, the OSC is always terminated at intermediate amplifier sites, where it receives local information before re-transmission.

The introduction of the ITU-T G.694.1 frequency grid in 2002 has made it easier to integrate WDM with older but more standard SONET/SDH systems. WDM wavelengths are positioned in a grid having exactly 100 GHz (about 0.8 nm) spacing in optical frequency, with a reference frequency fixed at 193.10 THz (1,552.52 nm). The main grid is placed inside the optical fiber amplifier bandwidth, but can be extended to wider bandwidths. The first commercial deployment of DWDM was made by Ciena Corporation on the Sprint network in June 1996. Today&#x27;s DWDM systems use 50 GHz or even 25 GHz channel spacing for up to 160 channel operation.

DWDM systems have to maintain more stable wavelength or frequency than those needed for CWDM because of the closer spacing of the wavelengths. Precision temperature control of the laser transmitter is required in DWDM systems to prevent drift off a very narrow frequency window of the order of a few GHz. In addition, since DWDM provides greater maximum capacity it tends to be used at a higher level in the communications hierarchy than CWDM, for example on the Internet backbone and is therefore associated with higher modulation rates, thus creating a smaller market for DWDM devices with very high performance. These factors of smaller volume and higher performance result in DWDM systems typically being more expensive than CWDM.

Recent innovations in DWDM transport systems include pluggable and software-tunable transceiver modules capable of operating on 40 or 80 channels. This dramatically reduces the need for discrete spare pluggable modules, when a handful of pluggable devices can handle the full range of wavelengths.

===Wavelength-converting transponders===

Wavelength-converting transponders originally translated the transmit wavelength of a client-layer signal into one of the DWDM system&#x27;s internal wavelengths in the 1,550 nm band. External wavelengths in the 1,550 nm most likely need to be translated, as they almost certainly do not have the required frequency stability tolerances nor the optical power necessary for the system&#x27;s EDFA.

In the mid-1990s, however, wavelength-converting transponders rapidly took on the additional function of signal regeneration. Signal regeneration in transponders quickly evolved through 1R to 2R to 3R and into overhead-monitoring multi-bitrate 3R regenerators. These differences are outlined below:

; 1R: Retransmission. Basically, early transponders were garbage in, garbage out in that their output was nearly an analog &quot;copy&quot; of the received optical signal, with little signal cleanup occurring. This limited the reach of early DWDM systems because the signal had to be handed off to a client-layer receiver (likely from a different vendor) before the signal deteriorated too far. Signal monitoring was basically confined to optical domain parameters such as received power.

; 2R: Re-time and re-transmit. Transponders of this type were not very common and utilized a quasi-digital Schmitt-triggering method for signal clean-up. Some rudimentary signal-quality monitoring was done by such transmitters that basically looked at analogue parameters.

; 3R: Re-time, re-transmit, re-shape. 3R Transponders were fully digital and normally able to view SONET/SDH section layer overhead bytes such as A1 and A2 to determine signal quality health. Many systems will offer transponders, which will normally mean the transponder is able to perform 3R regeneration on OC-3/12/48 signals, and possibly gigabit Ethernet, and reporting on signal health by monitoring SONET/SDH section layer overhead bytes. Many transponders will be able to perform full multi-rate 3R in both directions. Some vendors offer transponders, which will perform Section layer overhead monitoring to all rates up to and including OC-192.

; Muxponder: The muxponder (from multiplexed transponder) has different names depending on vendor. It essentially performs some relatively simple time-division multiplexing of lower-rate signals into a higher-rate carrier within the system (a common example is the ability to accept 4 OC-48s and then output a single OC-192 in the 1,550 nm band). More recent muxponder designs have absorbed more and more TDM functionality, in some cases obviating the need for traditional SONET/SDH transport equipment.

===List of DWDM Channels===

For DWDM the range between C21-C60 is the most common range, for Mux/Demux in 8, 16, 40 or 96 sizes.

===Reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexer (ROADM)===

As mentioned above, intermediate optical amplification sites in DWDM systems may allow for the dropping and adding of certain wavelength channels. In most systems deployed as of August 2006 this is done infrequently, because adding or dropping wavelengths requires manually inserting or replacing wavelength-selective cards. This is costly, and in some systems requires that all active traffic be removed from the DWDM system because inserting or removing the wavelength-specific cards interrupts the multi-wavelength optical signal.

With a ROADM, network operators can remotely reconfigure the multiplexer by sending soft commands. The architecture of the ROADM is such that dropping or adding wavelengths does not interrupt the &quot;pass-through&quot; channels. Numerous technological approaches are utilized for various commercial ROADMs, the tradeoff being between cost, optical power, and flexibility.

===Optical cross connects (OXCs)===
When the network topology is a mesh, where nodes are interconnected by fibers to form an arbitrary graph, an additional fiber interconnection device is needed to route the signals from an input port to the desired output port. These devices are called optical crossconnectors (OXCs). Various categories of OXCs include electronic (&quot;opaque&quot;), optical (&quot;transparent&quot;), and wavelength-selective devices.

== Enhanced WDM ==
Cisco&#x27;s Enhanced WDM system is a network architecture that combines two different types of multiplexing technologies to transmit data over optical fibers. 

EWDM combines Coarse Wave Division Multiplexing (CWDM) connections using SFPs and GBICs with Dense Wave Division Multiplexing (DWDM) connections using XENPAK, X2 or XFP DWDM modules. The Enhanced WDM system can use either passive or boosted DWDM connections to allow a longer range for the connection. In addition to this, C form-factor pluggable modules deliver Ethernet suitable for high-speed Internet backbone connections.

== Shortwave WDM ==
Shortwave WDM uses vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) transceivers with four wavelengths in the 846 to 953 nm range over single OM5 fiber, or two-fiber connectivity for OM3/OM4 fiber.

==Transceivers versus transponders==
; Transceivers: Since communication over a single wavelength is one-way (simplex communication), and most practical communication systems require two-way (duplex communication) communication, two wavelengths will be required if on the same fiber; if separate fibers are used in a so-called fiber pair, then the same wavelength is normally used and it is not WDM. As a result, at each end both a transmitter and a receiver will be required. A combination of a transmitter and a receiver is called a transceiver; it converts an electrical signal to and from an optical signal. WDM transceivers made for single-strand operation require the opposing transmitters to use different wavelengths. WDM transceivers additionally require an optical splitter/combiner to couple the transmitter and receiver paths onto the one fiber strand.
; Transponder: In practice, the signal inputs and outputs will not be electrical but optical instead (typically at 1550 nm). This means that in effect wavelength converters are needed instead, which is exactly what a transponder is. A transponder can be made up of two transceivers placed after each other: the first transceiver converting the 1550 nm optical signal to/from an electrical signal, and the second transceiver converting the electrical signal to/from an optical signal at the required wavelength. Transponders that don&#x27;t use an intermediate electrical signal (all-optical transponders) are in development.

<text>Babes in Toyland was an American rock band from Minneapolis, Minnesota, formed in 1987. The band was founded by vocalist and guitarist Kat Bjelland, along with drummer Lori Barbero and bassist Michelle Leon, who was later replaced by Maureen Herman in 1992.

Babes in Toyland released three studio albums: &quot;Spanking Machine&quot; (1990), followed by the commercially successful &quot;Fontanelle&quot; (1992), and &quot;Nemesisters&quot; (1995), before becoming inactive in 1997 and eventually disbanding in 2001. 

In 2014, the band reunited; the following year, they began performing live together for the first time in over a decade. They completed an international tour throughout 2015, during which bassist Herman was fired and replaced with Clara Salyer. The band broke up again in 2017. The band is often grouped in with the riot grrrl scene. 

==History==
===1987–1991: Formation and early years===
Babes in Toyland formed in 1987, after frontwoman Kat Bjelland met drummer Lori Barbero at a friend&#x27;s barbecue. Originally from Woodburn, Oregon and a former resident of San Francisco, Bjelland had moved to Minneapolis to form a band. Bjelland was a self-taught guitarist, and at the time Barbero had no experience playing any instruments. Bjelland commented: &quot;Hopefully, from being technically inexperienced, you can use your imagination, and play the drums like an instrument instead of just being a beat-keeper. And play the bass like you feel it, from your gut, instead of saying, &#x27;Here&#x27;s my scales.&#x27;&quot; In its initial formation in 1987, in addition to Bjelland and Barbero, the band included Kris Holetz on bass and singer Cindy Russell. 

Following the departures of Holetz and Russell, it was believed that the band briefly recruited Bjelland&#x27;s friend and former bandmate, Courtney Love, on bass, as Love claimed to have been &quot;kicked out&quot; of the band. However, during a 2015 interview, Bjelland and Barbero refuted this, with Barbero stating: &quot;She lived in my house, and one time I think when we were rehearsing she came down and probably picked up something and tried to play and we were just like, &quot;get out of here.&quot; However, Michelle Leon, who was hired as the group&#x27;s bass player, claimed that she was briefly replaced by Love as bassist shortly after joining. After the group rehearsed with Love on &quot;a couple&quot; of occasions, Leon stated Barbero called her and asked her to re-join the band. It has been noted that several songs from the Babes In Toyland&#x27;s debut album shared lyrics and verses with several songs by Hole, most notably Hole&#x27;s first several singles, including b-sides from &quot;Retard Girl&quot; and &quot;Dicknail&quot;. 
The group began performing shows at local art galleries and other venues in late 1987. Local journalist Jon Bream, who initially disparaged the band, recalled: &quot;They were a sort of loud, abrasive, angry, obnoxious thing at first and very amateurish in a sense. And then they developed over time into something that was pretty amazing...The shows just seemed to make more sense. There was a focus there...They were able to connect with the audience.&quot; In 1988 they released their first single, &quot;Dust Cake Boy&quot;, on Treehouse Records. The band entered the studio in 1989 to record their debut album, &quot;Spanking Machine&quot;, which was recorded with grunge producer Jack Endino at Seattle&#x27;s Reciprocal Recording and released in April 1990 on Minneapolis&#x27; Twin/Tone Records. The album caught the attention of underground rock band Sonic Youth, whose frontman Thurston Moore invited the band to perform on Sonic Youth&#x27;s 1990 European tour to promote their latest album, &quot;Goo&quot;. Babes in Toyland subsequently performed alongside Sonic Youth at 1991&#x27;s Reading Festival, which was documented in Dave Markey&#x27;s music documentary, &quot;1991: The Year Punk Broke&quot;.

British DJ John Peel was also a fan of the album, citing it as his &quot;favourite album of 1990.&quot; During the band&#x27;s tour with Sonic Youth in 1990, Babes in Toyland recorded a radio session for John Peel, one of the many Peel Sessions. The band also completed a second session with Peel in 1991, and the sessions were released as &quot;The Peel Sessions&quot; — the band&#x27;s second EP — in 1992. Their first EP, &quot;To Mother&quot;, was composed of outtakes from &quot;Spanking Machine&quot; and was released in July 1991; &quot;To Mother&quot; was a commercial success, entering the UK Indie Chart at number one, and remaining in the top position for ten weeks.

===1992–1995: Mainstream success===
After touring in 1991, the band entered the studio for a second time to record their major label follow-up to &quot;Spanking Machine&quot;. Bassist Michelle Leon left the group in early 1992, shortly after the murder of Joe Cole, her then boyfriend. Maureen Herman was recruited as her replacement. With this new line-up, the band signed with Warner Bros.&#x27;s Reprise Records. Their second studio album, &quot;Fontanelle&quot; was recorded in Cannon Falls, Minnesota and in New York City, and featured production from Sonic Youth&#x27;s Lee Ranaldo. &quot;Fontanelle&quot; was released in 1992, and sold over 250,000 copies in the United States alone. The lead single on the album, &quot;Bruise Violet,&quot; is said to be an attack on Courtney Love. However, Bjelland denied this, saying instead that &quot;Violet&quot; was the name of a muse to both her and Love. A music video for &quot;Bruise Violet&quot; was shot in the SoHo loft of photographer Cindy Sherman, who also appears in the video as Bjelland&#x27;s doppelganger. Sherman&#x27;s photos appear on the covers of &quot;Fontanelle&quot; and the group&#x27;s second EP, &quot;Painkillers&quot;, and the imagery was recreated on stage banners with the artist&#x27;s permission.

In 1993, the band was chosen to take part in that year&#x27;s Lollapalooza tour, playing alongside such acts as Primus, Alice in Chains, Dinosaur Jr. and Rage Against the Machine. During dates at Lollapalooza, the band released their third and final EP, &quot;Painkillers&quot;, in June 1993. In 1994, journalist Neal Karlen began writing &quot;Babes in Toyland: The Making and Selling of a Rock and Roll Band&quot;, which dealt with the band&#x27;s signing to Warner and the recording of &quot;Fontanelle&quot;. Commenting on the book in retrospect, Bjelland said: &quot;I feel bad for [Karlen]. He told me he lost a lot of his notes halfway through, and he spent his advance. So he made a lot of it up. Part of it’s true. But a lot of it’s not. He’s apologized.&quot; 

On April 8, 1994, Babes in Toyland played a benefit show for Rock Against Domestic Violence with 7 Year Bitch, and Jack Off Jill in Miami at the Cameo Theater, the same day lead-singer of American grunge rock band Nirvana, Kurt Cobain, had been found dead in his Seattle home. Around the same time, the band were featured on the cover of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, and were referenced in a 1995 episode of the sitcom &quot;Roseanne&quot; 

In May 1995, the band released their final album, &quot;Nemesisters&quot;. The album received mixed reviews, with Lorraine Ali of &quot;Spin&quot; writing: &quot;With &quot;Nemesisters&quot;, Babes in Toyland&#x27;s molten core seems to have somewhat solidified; this album ultimately lacks the conviction, depth, and even direction of its predecessors.&quot; The band described the recording process of the album &quot;diverse&quot;, &quot;experimental&quot; and &quot;spontaneous&quot; and that the writing and recording process was &quot;very different&quot; as the band were working under pressure. Tours for the album took place throughout Europe - notably with a date at Denmark&#x27;s Roskilde Festival - the United States, and Australia.

===1996–2001: Herman&#x27;s departure, Katastrophy Wife and breakup===
The band lost their contract with their record label when Herman left the band due to hip problems in 1996. Dana Cochrane, formerly of the band Mickey Finn, played bass with the band on live gigs in 1996 and 1997. Original bassist Michelle Leon briefly rejoined the band for a short period in 1997, when Babes in Toyland were constantly breaking up and reforming and planning on releasing a fourth studio album. In 1998, the band was credited with the song &quot;Overtura: Astroantiquity/Attacatastrophy&quot; on the CD &quot;Songs of the Witchblade: A Soundtrack to the Comic Book&quot;, which Bjelland co-produced. Bjelland and Barbero played with a new bassist, Jessie Farmer, in 2000.

However, a year earlier, Bjelland had formed a new band, Katastrophy Wife. Babes in Toyland performed a reunion show billed as &quot;The Last Tour&quot; on November 21, 2001which was released as a live album called &quot;Minneapolism&quot;and this was not only the last Babes in Toyland show, but also the last official activity at the time. Bjelland played a number of shows in Europe in 2002 under the title Babes in Toyland with a new drummer and bassist from the British band Angelica; however, Bjelland stopped using the name after Barbero and Herman raised legal issues.

===2014–2020: Reunion, tour and second breakup===

In an interview with Lancer Radio at Pasadena College on July 26, 2014, Kat Bjelland and Maureen Herman confirmed that they were getting back together to write new material and play shows. They played their first reunion show in Pioneertown, California at Pappy And Harriet&#x27;s Pioneertown Palace on February 10, 2015. They played their second show at The Roxy Theatre in Los Angeles, California on February 12, 2015. They were introduced by Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine who recalled on his experiences performing with the band at Lollapalooza in 1993. The show&#x27;s other celebrity guests included Patty Schemel, Eric Erlandson, Brody Dalle, and Donita Sparks. 

The band embarked on an international tour in May 2015, beginning with shows in England, Scotland, Spain, and Italy, followed by a North American tour, which included performances at Seattle&#x27;s Bumbershoot festival and the Montreal Pop festival. In Minneapolis, where the band formed, the trio played on the Walker Art Center&#x27;s lawn for the two-day Rock the Garden festival, June 20–21, 2015. 

In August 2015, midway through the band&#x27;s tour, bassist Herman was fired from the band, for originally unspecified reasons, and replaced with Clara Salyer. In December 2015, Herman claimed the reason she had been asked to leave the band was due to an article she had written for the website Boing Boing on the sexual assault of Runaways bassist Jackie Fox by manager Kim Fowley in 1975 and Joan Jett&#x27;s denial of having witnessed it. Herman stated that because of Barbero&#x27;s business connections with Jettnamely Barbero producing an album for a band under Jett&#x27;s record label, Blackheart RecordsHerman was kicked out of the band. Barbero responded in a subsequent interview: 

Babes In Toyland played their final show and broke up again in 2017. In May 2020, speaking on the podcast &quot;Conan Neutron&#x27;s Protonic Reversal&quot;, Lori Barbero said that there was very little chance of future reunions from the band.

==Legacy==

Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote of the band: &quot;Babes in Toyland is about as harsh as rock music getsguitarist Kat Bjelland screams and thrashes her guitar to the gut-pounding, throttling beat of bassist Maureen Herman and drummer Lori Barbero... the all-female trio offer no escape from their strongly female-oriented, but not necessarily feminist, rock.&quot; Kathleen Hanna of Bikini Kill said in a 2010 interview: &quot;Babes in Toyland was a band that was hugely important to us and we were like, God if only we could play awesome shows like Babes in Toyland&quot;.

The band has been honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, recognizing performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star &quot;might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis&quot;, according to journalist Steve Marsh.

<doc id="80475" wikidata="Q203636" url="?curid=80475" title="Stilicho">
<text>Stilicho (; – 22 August 408) was a military commander in the Roman army who, for a time, became the most powerful man in the Western Roman Empire. He was partly of Vandal origins and married to Serena, the niece of emperor Theodosius I. He became guardian for the underage Honorius. After years of struggle against barbarian and Roman enemies, political and military disasters finally allowed his enemies in the court of Honorius to remove him from power. His fall culminated in his arrest and execution in 408.

== Origins and rise to power ==
Besides the relevant legal records in the &quot;Codex Theodosianus&quot;, the major primary source for the events of Stilicho&#x27;s reign, or at least events prior to 404, are the panegyrics addressed to him by the poet Claudian, whom he patronized after the death of Theodosius I. These are likely quite biased and portray Stilicho in a positive light. For events after 404, Zosimus is the main source; he derived his information on Stilicho from two prior historians, whose texts he copies faithfully, although in summary. One of these historians, Eunapius, was hostile to Stilicho, and the other, Olympiodorus, was supportive, resulting in a bit of a garbled, contradictory account. Stilicho also maintained correspondence with his friend, the renowned pagan senator Symmachus.

Stilicho was the son of a Vandal cavalry officer and a provincial woman of Roman birth. Despite his father&#x27;s origins, there is little to suggest that Stilicho considered himself anything other than a Roman, and his high rank within the empire suggests that he was probably not an Arian like many Germanic Christians but rather a Nicene Christian like his patron Theodosius I, who declared Nicene Christianity the official religion of the empire.

Stilicho joined the Roman army and rose through the ranks during the reign of Theodosius I, who ruled the Eastern half of the Roman Empire from Constantinople, and who was to become the last emperor to rule both the eastern and western halves of the empire jointly. In 383, Theodosius sent him as a &quot;tribunus praetorianus&quot;, an office in the branch of military administrators known as the &quot;notarii,&quot; on an embassy mission to the court of the Persian King Shapur III in Ctesiphon to negotiate a peace settlement relating to the partition of Armenia. Historians have a difficult time explaining exactly what led to his marriage to Serena which occurred after his return to Constantinople at the successful conclusion of peace talks. Claudian claims that Theodosius awarded Stilicho with Serena’s hand because of his outstanding achievements, but as Stilicho was actually just a junior member of the embassy and not its leader, nor had he done anything else of note, this is certainly panegyrical publicity. Perhaps the varied duties of the &quot;notarii&quot; at some point placed Stilicho inside the imperial residence of Constantinople where he encountered Serena and they decided the match themselves, or maybe Theodosius saw a good outcome in tying a young, up-and-coming, half-barbarian general to the imperial household. The marriage would see the birth of a son, who was named Eucherius, and two daughters, Maria and Thermantia.

Whatever its origin, this match undoubtedly raised Stilicho&#x27;s prospects. He was promoted to &quot;comes sacri stabuli&quot; and soon after to &quot;comes domesticorum&quot; in 385. It is unclear whether he participated in the campaign against Magnus Maximus or remained in Constantinople during that time. In 392 or 393, Theodosius promoted Stilicho to &quot;comes et magister utriusque militiae&quot; and gave him command of soldiers in Thrace.

After the death of the Western emperor Valentinian II in 392, Theodosius appointed Stilicho as co-commander of the army with Timasius. They were victorious over the Western army at the Battle of the Frigidus. One of his comrades during the campaign was the Visigothic warlord Alaric, who commanded a substantial number of Gothic auxiliaries. Alaric would go on to become Stilicho&#x27;s chief adversary during his later career as the head of the Western Roman armies. Stilicho distinguished himself at the Frigidus, and Theodosius, exhausted by the campaign, saw him as a man worthy of responsibility for the future safety of the empire. In several of the Claudian poems celebrating Theodosius&#x27;s victories, Stilicho&#x27;s participation and contribution to the campaign were highlighted. This helped him gain popularity in the empire. The last emperor of a united Rome appointed Stilicho guardian of his son Honorius, with the rank of &quot;comes et magister utriusque militiae praesentalis&quot; (supreme commander), shortly before his death in 395.

At the time of Theodosius&#x27;s death, the field armies that had clashed at the Frigidus were still in disarray and fighting was still continuing. Claudian, Stilicho&#x27;s panegyrist, makes Theodosius&#x27;s spirit say &quot;When I was raised to heaven disorder... and tumult did I leave behind me. The army was still drawing the forbidden sword in that Alpine war, and conquerors and conquered gave alternate cause for dissension. Scarce could this madness have been calmed by my vigilance, much less by a boy&#x27;s rule... &#x27;Twas then that Stilicho took my place...&quot;

==Serving Honorius==
Following the death of Theodosius, Honorius became emperor of the Western Roman Empire while his brother Arcadius was placed on the Eastern throne in Constantinople. As both were underage, Stilicho remained the caretaker for Honorius until he came of age. He would claim to have been given a similar role in regards to Arcadius, although no independent verification of this exists. Neither proved to powerfully assert themselves as leaders, and Stilicho came to be the &quot;de facto&quot; commander-in-chief of the Roman armies in the west while his rival Rufinus became the power behind the throne in the east. To strengthen his hold over the emperor, he gave Honorius his daughter Maria&#x27;s hand in marriage in 398, and after her death, Thermantia&#x27;s in 408. Both of these marriages did not produce any children. Stilicho used his military leadership as well as Honorius&#x27; youth and inexperience to consolidate his authority over the empire, though he acquired many rivals and enemies in the process, both in the West and East.

=== Balkans Campaign===

His first brush with such court politics came in 395. After the Battle of Frigidus the Goths, under their new king Alaric, were returning to their allotted lands in Lower Moesia when they decided to raid the countryside. By doing so Alaric effectively broke his treaty with Rome. Unfortunately for the Romans, the armies of the Eastern Empire were occupied with Hunnic incursions in Asia Minor and Syria. Rufinus, Praetorian Prefect of the East, attempted to negotiate with Alaric in person. Officials in Constantinople suspected Rufinus was in league with the Goths. Stilicho led the army, which had been victorious at the Frigidus and was still assembled in Italy, into the Balkans to confront the Goths, eventually surrounding them somewhere in Thessaly. According to Claudian, Stilicho was in a position to destroy them, but was ordered by Arcadius to return the Eastern Empire&#x27;s forces and leave Illyricum. Stilicho resented the orders, for he was in a position to defeat Alaric&#x27;s Goths, but he obeyed them anyway. When the Eastern Empire&#x27;s forces arrived at Constantinople, Arcadius and Rufinus rode out to meet them. At this meeting Rufinus was murdered by the troops. Many historians suspect the involvement of Stilicho in the assassination/murder of Rufinus.

In 396 Stilicho campaigned against the Franks and other Germanic tribes in Gaul. He used the campaign to boost the morale of the western army – which had suffered three consecutive defeats in the civil wars against Theodosius – and to recruit Germanic auxiliaries to bolster its depleted ranks. The next year, in 397, Stilicho defeated Alaric&#x27;s forces in Macedonia, but Alaric himself escaped into the surrounding mountains. Edward Gibbon, drawing on Zosimus, criticizes Stilicho for being overconfident in victory and indulging in luxury and women, allowing Alaric to escape. Contemporary scholarship disagrees, and finds a variety of possible explanations, including an order from Arcadius directing him to evacuate the Eastern Empire, the unreliability of his mostly barbarian troops, the revolt of Gildo in Africa or the possibility that he simply was never as close to Alaric as Claudian suggests.

===Revolt in Africa===

Later that year, Gildo, the &quot;comes et magister utriusque militiae per Africam&quot; (the commander of all troops in Africa), revolted. He declared his intention to place the African provinces, the critical source of Rome&#x27;s grain supply, under the control of the Eastern Empire. Stilicho sent Mascezel, the brother of Gildo, into Africa with an army, which quickly suppressed the rebellion. However, upon his return to Italy, Mascezel was drowned under questionable circumstances, perhaps on the orders of a jealous Stilicho. The year 400 also saw Stilicho accorded the highest honour within the Roman state by being appointed consul.

===Pictish Campaign===

Stilicho also fought a war in Britain in this time period, likely in the year 398, dubbed Stilicho&#x27;s Pictish War. The campaign against the Picts is highly disputed. The troops defending the British provinces probably defeated an invasion by the Picts without any support from Stilicho – who is never recorded to have left Italy in 398. Claudian refers to Stilicho providing Britannia with forts and a legion to protect it from incursions by Picts and Scots. However, a critical analysis of his panegyric suggests that things went badly.

===The Gothic War ===

In 401 Stilicho led the praesental army from Italy into Raetia and Noricum in response to an invasion by Vandals and Alans. Sensing an opportunity Alaric invaded Italy and lay siege to Mediolanum (Milan) where Honorius was residing. In 402 Stilicho returned to Italy and hastened forward with a selected vanguard in advance of his main body, breaking the siege of Mediolanum and rescuing the besieged emperor. One of his chieftains implored him to retreat from Italy, but Alaric refused. In a surprise attack on Easter Sunday in 402, Stilicho defeated Alaric at the Battle of Pollentia, capturing his camp and his wife. Alaric himself managed to escape with most of his men. This battle was the last victory celebrated in a triumphal march in Rome, which was saved for the time being. At Verona, Stilicho again bested Alaric, who managed to escape with a diminished force. A truce was made and Alaric went to Illyricum where he and his men were settled in the border provinces of Noricum and Pannonia (probably &quot;Pannonia Secunda&quot;).

===Campaign in North Italy===

In 405 Radagaisus, the king of one of the Gothic tribes north of the Danube, led a combined force of Goths, Alans, Sueves, and Vandals across the Danube and the Alps and into Italy. This disrupted Stilicho&#x27;s plans to re-take Illyricum from the Eastern Empire with the help of Alaric. Stilicho, scraping together a force of c. 20,000 men (thirty &quot;numeri&quot; of Roman troops with supporting units of federates of Alans and Huns) through a variety of desperate methods, including efforts to enroll slaves in the army in exchange for their freedom, at Ticinum (Pavia) led this force at the beginning of the campaigning season in 406 against Radagaisus. Fortunately for Stilicho, Radagaisus had split his forces into three divisions; two were pillaging the Italian countryside while the largest contingent – under Radagaisus himself – was laying siege to Florentia. Stilicho marched his entire army against Radagaisus at Florentia, managed to surprise him and captured almost his entire force. Stilicho executed Radagaisus and enrolled 12,000 of his warriors in his army. The rest were sold off as slaves.

In late 406, Stilicho demanded the return of the eastern half of Illyricum (which had been transferred to the administrative control of Constantinople by Theodosius), threatening war if the Eastern Roman Empire resisted. The exact reasons for this are unclear, but there are several theories: 1) Stilicho wanted Illyricum as a recruiting ground for his army (recruiting troops in the western provinces proved difficult because most able bodied men were employed by the western elite which he could not afford to antagonize). 2) Stilicho feared that Italy could be invaded from Illyricum if he did not control the Diocese himself (directly or indirectly through Alaric). 3) Stilicho planned to neutralize Alaric as a threat by employing him and his battle-hardened troops in the Western Empire&#x27;s defences and made him &quot;comes et magister militum per Illyricum&quot; (Stilicho and Alaric would take Illyricum from the Eastern Empire, Alaric would defend Illyricum, leaving Stilicho free to concentrate on the north). A combination of all three is also a possibility.

== Downfall ==
In order to protect Italy from invasions by Alaric (401–402) and Radagaisus (405–406), Stilicho had seriously depleted the Roman forces defending the Rhine frontier. He left it defended &quot;only by the faith of the Germans and the ancient terror of the Roman name&quot;, as Gibbon put it. In 406 a coalition of Vandals, Alans, and Suevi (Quadians, Marcomanni, and Alemanni) from central Europe arrived at the Rhine frontier. The Franks, Rome&#x27;s allies on the northern Rhine, tried to stop the Vandals from entering the Empire and fought them on the far bank of the Rhine. The Vandals defeated the Franks with the help of the Alans, but lost their king Godigisel. On 31 December 406, the coalition crossed the poorly defended Rhine frontier. These new migrants proceeded to devastate the provinces of Gaul, as well as triggering military revolts there and in Britannia. Stilicho&#x27;s reputation would never recover from this disaster.

The destruction that occurred in Gaul and the lack of an effective response from the court in Ravenna lent support to the rebellion of Constantine III in Britain, which Stilicho proved unable to quash. As Constantine moved his forces into Gaul, Stilicho sent his subordinate Sarus to oppose him. Sarus had some initial success, winning a major victory and killing both of Constantine&#x27;s &quot;magistri militum&quot;, but a relief force drove him back and saved the rebellion. Sarus withdrew and Stilicho decided to seal off the Alps to prevent Constantine from threatening Italy.

Meanwhile, Constantine&#x27;s rebellion having interrupted the negotiations between Alaric and Stilicho for the joint attack on Illyria, Alaric demanded the payment he was owed, threatening to attack Italy again if he did not receive a large amount of gold. The senate, &quot;inspired by the courage, rather than the wisdom, of their predecessors&quot;, as Gibbon put it, favored war with Alaric until Stilicho persuaded them to give into Alaric&#x27;s demands. They were angry at Stilicho for this, and one of the most outspoken of them, Lampadius, said &quot;&quot;Non est ista pax, sed pactio servitutis&quot; (This is not peace, but a pact of servitude).&quot;

Stilicho&#x27;s unsuccessful attempts to deal with Constantine, and rumors that he had earlier planned the assassination of Rufinus and that he planned to place his son on the throne following the death of emperor Arcadius (1 May 408), caused a revolt. The Roman army at Ticinum mutinied on August 13, 408, killing at least seven senior imperial officers (Zosimus 5.32). John Matthews observed that the following events &quot;have every appearance of a thoroughly co-ordinated coup d&#x27;état organized by Stilicho&#x27;s political opponents&quot;. Stilicho retired to Ravenna, where he was taken into captivity. Stilicho did not resist and was executed on August 22, 408, as was his son, Eucherius, shortly afterwards.

=== Aftermath ===
In the disturbances which followed, the wives and children of barbarian &quot;foederati&quot; throughout Italy were slain by the local Romans. The natural consequence was that these men (estimates describe their numbers as perhaps 30,000 strong) flocked to the protection of Alaric, clamoring to be led against their enemies. The Visigothic warlord accordingly crossed the Julian Alps and began a campaign through the heart of Italy. By September 408, the barbarians stood before the walls of Rome.

Without a strong general like Stilicho, Honorius could do little to break the siege, and adopted a passive strategy trying to wait out Alaric, hoping to regather his forces to defeat the Visigoths in the meantime. What followed was two years of political and military manoeuvering, Alaric, king of the Goths, attempting to secure a permanent peace treaty and rights to settle within Roman territory. He besieged Rome three times without attacking while the Roman army of Italy watched helplessly, but only after a fourth failed attempt at a deal was Alaric&#x27;s siege a success. After months under siege the people of Rome were dying of hunger and some were resorting to cannibalism. Then, the Gothic army broke through the gates and sacked the city in August of 410. Many historians argue that the removal of Stilicho was the main catalyst leading to this monumental event, the first barbarian capture of Rome in nearly eight centuries and a part of the fall of the Western Roman Empire.

<text>There are many different numbering schemes for assigning nominal numbers to entities. These generally require an agreed set of rules, or a central coordinator. The schemes can be considered to be examples of a primary key of a database management system table, whose table definitions require a database design.

In computability theory, the simplest numbering scheme is the assignment of natural numbers to a set of objects such as functions, rational numbers, graphs, or words in some formal language. A numbering can be used to transfer the idea of computability and related concepts, which are originally defined on the natural numbers using computable functions, to these different types of objects.

A simple extension is to assign cardinal numbers to physical objects according to the choice of some base of reference and of measurement units for counting or measuring these objects within a given precision. In such case, numbering is a kind of classification, i.e. assigning a numeric property to each object of the set to subdivide this set into related subsets forming a partition of the initial set, possibly infinite and not enumeratable using a single natural number for each class of the partition.

In some cases (such as computing, time-telling, and in some countries the numbering of floors in buildings) zero-based numbering is used, where the first entity is assigned &quot;zero&quot; instead of &quot;one&quot;.

<text>Juliana (; Juliana Louise Emma Marie Wilhelmina; 30 April 1909 – 20 March 2004) was Queen of the Netherlands from 1948 until her abdication in 1980.

Juliana was the only child of Queen Wilhelmina and Prince Henry of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. She received a private education and studied international law at the University of Leiden. In 1937, she married Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld with whom she had four daughters: Beatrix, Irene, Margriet, and Christina. During the German invasion of the Netherlands in the Second World War, the royal family was evacuated to the United Kingdom. Juliana then relocated to Canada with her children, while Wilhelmina and Bernhard remained in Britain. The royal family returned to the Netherlands after its liberation in 1945.

Due to Wilhelmina&#x27;s failing health, Juliana took over royal duties briefly in 1947 and 1948. In September 1948, Wilhelmina abdicated and Juliana ascended to the Dutch throne. Her reign saw the decolonization and independence of the Dutch East Indies and Suriname. Despite a series of controversies involving the royal family, Juliana remained a popular figure among the Dutch.

In April 1980, Juliana abdicated in favour of her eldest daughter, Beatrix. Upon her death in 2004 at the age of , she was the longest-lived former reigning monarch in the world.

==Early life and education==
Juliana was born on 30 April 1909 at Noordeinde Palace in The Hague, the only child of the reigning Dutch monarch, Queen Wilhelmina. Her father was Duke Henry of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. She was the first Dutch royal baby since Wilhelmina herself was born in 1880. Wilhelmina had suffered two miscarriages and one stillbirth, raising the prospect of a succession crisis.

The Queen&#x27;s nearest relative was Prince Heinrich XXXII Reuss of Köstritz, whose close ties to Germany made him unpopular in the Netherlands. Juliana&#x27;s birth thus assured the royal family&#x27;s survival. Her mother suffered two further miscarriages after her birth, leaving Juliana as the royal couple&#x27;s only child. According to several sources Juliana was happy to be an only child because that meant she did not have to fight for attention.

Juliana spent her childhood at Het Loo Palace in Apeldoorn, and at Noordeinde Palace and Huis ten Bosch Palace in The Hague. A small school class was formed at Noordeinde Palace on the advice of the educator Jan Ligthart so that, from the age of six, the Princess could receive her primary education with children of her own age. These children were Baroness Elise Bentinck, Baroness Elisabeth van Hardenbroek and Jonkvrouwe Miek (Mary) de Jonge.

As the Dutch constitution specified that Princess Juliana should be ready to succeed to the throne by the age of eighteen, her education proceeded at a faster pace than that of most children. After five years of primary education, the Princess received her secondary education (to pre-university level) from private tutors.

On 30 April 1927, Princess Juliana celebrated her eighteenth birthday. Under the constitution, she had officially come of age and was entitled to assume the royal prerogative, if necessary. Two days later her mother installed her in the &quot;Raad van State&quot; (&quot;Council of State&quot;).

In the same year, the Princess enrolled as a student at the University of Leiden. In her first years at university, she attended lectures in sociology, jurisprudence, economics, history of religion, parliamentary history, and constitutional law. In the course of her studies, she also attended lectures on the cultures of Suriname and the Netherlands Antilles, international affairs, international law, history, and European law. She graduated from the university in 1930 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in international law. She was taught Greek literature by Sophia Antoniadis, the university&#x27;s first female professor.

==Marriage==

In the 1930s, Queen Wilhelmina began a search for a suitable husband for her daughter. At the time, the House of Orange-Nassau was one of the most strictly religious royal families in the world, and it was very difficult to find a Protestant prince who suited their standards. Princes from the United Kingdom and Sweden were &quot;vetted&quot; but either declined or were rejected by the princess.

At the 1936 Winter Olympics in Bavaria, she met Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld, a young German Prince who was her 7th cousin, as both descended from Lebrecht, Prince of Anhalt-Zeitz-Hoym. His rank and religion were suitable; so Princess Juliana&#x27;s royal engagement was arranged by her mother. Princess Juliana fell deeply in love with her fiancé, a love that was to last a lifetime and that withstood separation during the war and Bernhard&#x27;s extramarital affairs and illegitimate children. Queen Wilhelmina, by then the richest woman in the world, left nothing to chance. Wilhelmina had her lawyers draw up a prenuptial agreement that specified exactly what the German-born prince could and could not do, and what money he would receive from the royal estate. The couple&#x27;s engagement was announced on 8 September 1936.

The wedding announcement divided a country that mistrusted Germany under Adolf Hitler. Prior to the wedding, on 24 November 1936, Prince Bernhard was granted Dutch citizenship and changed the spelling of his names from German to Dutch. They married in The Hague on 7 January 1937, the date on which Princess Juliana&#x27;s grandparents, King William III and Queen Emma, had married fifty-eight years earlier. The civil ceremony was held in the Town Hall of The Hague and the marriage was blessed in the Great Church (St. Jacobskerk), also located in The Hague. Juliana&#x27;s chosen bridesmaids were either relatives or family friends. These included Duchess Woizlawa Feodora of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (her first cousin), Duchess Thyra of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (her second cousin), Grand Duchess Kira Kirillovna of Russia (her first cousin once removed), Princess Sophie of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (her second cousin), and two of Bernhard&#x27;s first cousins, Princess Sieglinde of Lippe and Princess Elisabeth of Lippe.

A wedding gift was the royal yacht, &quot;Piet Hein&quot;. The young couple moved into Soestdijk Palace in Baarn.

The first of their four daughters, Princess Beatrix, was born on 31 January 1938, followed by Princess Irene on 5 August 1939.

==Canadian exile==

On 12 May 1940, during the invasion of the Netherlands by Germany in the Second World War, Prince Bernhard and Princess Juliana were evacuated to the United Kingdom to be followed the following day by Queen Wilhelmina and the Dutch Government, who set up a government in exile. The princess remained there for a month before taking the children to Ottawa, the capital of Canada, where she resided at Stornoway in the suburb of Rockcliffe Park. Her mother and husband remained in Britain with the Dutch government-in-exile.

When her third child, Princess Margriet, was born on 19 January 1943, Governor General Lord Athlone granted royal assent to a special law declaring Princess Juliana&#x27;s rooms at the Ottawa Civic Hospital to be extraterritorial in order that the infant would have exclusively Dutch, not dual nationality. Had these arrangements not been made, Princess Margriet would not be in the line of succession. The Canadian government flew the Dutch tricolour flag on parliament&#x27;s Peace Tower while its carillon rang out with Dutch music at the news of Princess Margriet&#x27;s birth. Prince Bernhard, who had remained in London to assist his mother in law Queen Wilhelmina and the government with operating in exile, was able to visit his family in Canada and be there for Margriet&#x27;s birth. Princess Juliana&#x27;s genuine warmth and the gestures of her Canadian hosts created a lasting bond, which was reinforced when Canadian soldiers fought and died by the thousands in 1944 and 1945 to liberate the Netherlands from the Nazis. She returned with Queen Wilhelmina by a military transport plane to the liberated part of the Netherlands on 2 May 1945, rushing to Breda to set up a temporary Dutch government. Once home, she expressed her gratitude to Canada by sending the city of Ottawa 100,000 tulip bulbs. Juliana erected a wooden lectern and brass plaque which is dedicated in thanks to the St. Andrew&#x27;s Presbyterian Church (Ottawa) for their hospitality during her residence in Ottawa.

On 24 June 1945, she sailed on the RMS &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; from Gourock, Scotland, to the United States, listing her last permanent residence as London, England. The following year (1946), Juliana donated another 20,500 bulbs, with the request that a portion of these be planted at the grounds of the Ottawa Civic Hospital where she had given birth to Margriet. At the same time, she promised Ottawa an annual gift of tulips during her lifetime to show her lasting appreciation for Canada&#x27;s war-time hospitality. Each year Ottawa hosts the Canadian Tulip Festival in celebration of this gift.

On 2 May 1945, Princess Juliana was returned with her mother to Dutch soil. Initially they lived in temporary quarters at Anneville just south of Breda. Juliana took part in the post-war relief operation for the people in the northern part of the country who had suffered through starvation during the Hunger Winter of 1944–1945, which had taken the lives of many of her countrymen. She was very active as the president of the Dutch Red Cross and worked closely with the National Reconstruction organization. Her down-to-earth manner endeared her to her people so much that a majority of the Dutch people would soon want Queen Wilhelmina to abdicate in favour of her daughter. In the spring of 1946 Princess Juliana and Prince Bernhard visited the countries that had helped the Netherlands during the occupation.

During her pregnancy with her last child, Marijke Christina, Princess Juliana contracted rubella. The girl was born in 1947 with cataracts in both eyes and was soon diagnosed as almost totally blind in one eye and severely limited in the other. Despite her blindness, Christina, as she was called, was a happy and gifted child with a talent for languages and an ear for music. Over time, and with advances in medical technology, her eyesight did improve such that with thick glasses, she could attend school and even ride a bicycle. However, before that happened, her mother, the Princess, clinging to any thread that offered some hope for a cure, came under the strong influence of Greet Hofmans, a faith healer with heterodox beliefs, who was considered by &quot;her many detractors&quot; to be a sham.

== Reign ==

=== Regency and early reign===

Wilhelmina&#x27;s increasingly precarious health made it increasingly difficult for her to perform her duties. Juliana was forced to take over as regent from 14 October to 1 December 1947. Wilhelmina seriously considered abdicating in favour of Juliana at the end of 1947, but Juliana urged her mother to stay on the throne so she could celebrate her golden jubilee in 1948. However, Wilhelmina was forced by further health problems to relinquish her royal duties to Juliana once again on 4 May 1948.

The independence of Indonesia, which saw more than 150,000 Dutch troops stationed there as decolonization force, was regarded as an economic disaster for the Netherlands. With the certain loss of the prized colony, the queen announced her intention to abdicate, doing so on 4 September 1948. Two days later, with the eyes of the world upon her, Juliana was sworn in and inaugurated as monarch during a joint session of the States General at a ceremony held in the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam, becoming the 12th member of the House of Orange to rule the Netherlands.

On 27 December 1949 at Dam Palace in Amsterdam, Queen Juliana signed the papers that recognised Indonesian sovereignty over the former Dutch colony. She became &quot;Hoofd der Unie&quot; (Head of the Union) of the Netherlands-Indonesian Union (1949–1956). On 15 December 1954, the Queen announced that the nation&#x27;s Caribbean possessions of the Netherlands Antilles and Suriname were to be reconstituted as constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, making them equal partners with the mainland.

The near-blindness of her daughter Christina and the increasing influence of Hofmans, who had moved into a royal palace, severely affected the queen&#x27;s marital relationship. Over the next few years, the controversy surrounding the faith healer, at first kept out of the Dutch media, erupted into a national debate over the competency of the queen. However, the debate subsided in part due to Juliana&#x27;s efforts to connect with her people. She often appeared in public dressed like any ordinary Dutch woman, and preferred to be addressed as &quot;Mevrouw&quot; (Dutch for &quot;Mrs.&quot;) rather than her formal title of &quot;majesty&quot;. She also began riding a bicycle for exercise and fresh air.

Although the bicycle and the down-to-earth manners suggest a simple life style, the Dutch royal court of the 1950s and 1960s was still an opulent affair with chamberlains in magnificent uniforms, gilded state coaches, visits to towns in open carriages and lavish entertaining in the huge palaces. At the same time the queen began visiting the citizens of the nearby towns and, unannounced, would drop in on social institutions and schools like her mother before her insisting on seeing reality rather than a prepared show. On the international stage, Queen Juliana was interested in the problems of developing countries, the refugee problem, and particularly child welfare in developing countries. Together with her daughters Beatrix and Irene, she took part in the ship tour organized by Queen Frederica and her husband King Paul of Greece in 1954, which became known as the “Cruise of the Kings” and was attended by over 100 royals from all over Europe. Francis of Bavaria, a participant, reports in his memoirs the anecdote that the queens of Greece, the Netherlands and Italy went ashore in a harbor in the middle of a crowd of nephews and nieces, and a waiting journalist called out to them: &quot;What is the purpose of this trip?&quot;, whereupon Queen Juliana replied with a friendly smile: &quot;Oh, you know, this is our union’s company outing.&quot;

=== Crises and recovery ===
On the night of 31 January 1953, the Netherlands was hit by the most destructive storm in more than five hundred years. Thirty breaches of dunes and dikes occurred and many towns were swept away by twelve-foot storm surges. More than 1800 people drowned and tens of thousands were trapped by the floodwaters. Dressed in boots and an old coat, Queen Juliana waded through water and slopped through deep mud all over the devastated areas to bring desperate people food and clothing. Showing compassion and concern, reassuring the people, her tireless efforts would permanently endear her to the citizens of the Netherlands.

In 1956, the influence of Hofmans on Juliana&#x27;s political views almost brought down the monarchy in a constitutional crisis; this caused the court and the royal family to split into a &quot;Bernhard faction&quot;, set on removing a queen considered a religious fanatic and a threat to NATO, and the queen&#x27;s pious and pacifist courtiers. Prime Minister Willem Drees resolved the crisis. However, Juliana lost out to her powerful husband and his friends. Hofmans was banished from the court and Juliana&#x27;s supporters were sacked or pensioned. Prince Bernhard planned to divorce his wife but decided against it when he, as he told an American journalist, &quot;found out that the woman still loved him&quot; .

Queen Juliana faced another crisis among her Protestant citizens in 1963, when her second daughter Irene secretly converted to Roman Catholicism and, without government approval, on 29 April 1964 married Prince Carlos Hugo of Bourbon, Duke of Parma, a claimant to the Spanish throne and also a leader in Spain&#x27;s Carlist party. Given the history of the Dutch struggle for independence from Roman Catholic Spain, and with fascist German oppression still fresh in the minds of the Dutch people, the events leading to the marriage were played out in all the newspapers and a storm of hostility erupted against the monarchy for allowing it to happen—a matter so serious that the queen&#x27;s abdication became a real possibility. She survived, however, thanks to the underlying devotion she had earned over the years.

Another crisis developed as a result of the announcement in July 1965 of the engagement of Princess Beatrix, heir to the throne, to German diplomat Claus von Amsberg. The future husband of the future queen had been a member of the Nazi Wehrmacht and the Hitler Youth movement. Many angry Dutch citizens demonstrated in the streets, and held rallies and marches against the &quot;traitorous&quot; affair. While this time there were no calls for the queen&#x27;s abdication—because the true object of the people&#x27;s wrath, Princess Beatrix, would then be queen—they did start to question the value of having a monarchy at all. After attempting to have the marriage cancelled, Queen Juliana acquiesced and the marriage took place under a continued storm of protest; an almost certain attitude pervaded the country that Princess Beatrix might be the last member of the House of Orange to ever reign in the Netherlands. Despite all these difficulties, Queen Juliana&#x27;s personal popularity suffered only temporarily.

The queen was noted for her courtesy and kindness. In May 1959, for example, Polish-American ufologist George Adamski received a letter from the head of the Dutch Unidentified Flying Objects Society, Rey d&#x27;Aquilla, informing him that she had been contacted by Queen Juliana&#x27;s palace and &quot;that the Queen would like to receive you&quot;. Adamski informed a London newspaper about the invitation, which prompted the court and cabinet to request that the queen cancel her meeting with Adamski, but the queen went ahead with the meeting, saying that &quot;A hostess cannot slam the door in the face of her guests.&quot; After the meeting, Dutch Aeronautical Association president Cornelis Kolff said: &quot;The Queen showed an extraordinary interest in the whole subject.&quot; The Dutch press put it more straightforwardly. According to &quot;Time&quot; magazine, newspaper &quot;de Volkskrant&quot; said: &quot;The Dutch press could hardly be accused of concealing the facts last week. Once again, Queen Juliana&#x27;s weakness for the preternatural had landed her back in the headlines: she had invited to the palace a crackpot from California who numbered among his friends men from Mars, Venus and other solar-system suburbs.&quot;

An event in April 1967, helped by an improving Dutch economy, brought an overnight revitalization of the royal family: the first male heir to the Dutch throne in 116 years, Willem-Alexander, was born to Princess Beatrix. This time, the demonstrations in the street were of love and enthusiasm.

=== Later reign ===
In the spring of 1975, a group of South Moluccans were caught conspiring to steal a heavy truck and ram the gates of Soestdijk Palace to kidnap the queen. Ten members of the group in a vehicle full of firearms were arrested. The group&#x27;s alleged aim was to force the Dutch government to recognize the Republik Maluku Selatan (RMS) as an independent state and try to make the Indonesian government do the same. Seventeen South-Moluccan youngsters were tried and convicted and sentenced to up to six years imprisonment. This was one of a series of actions for this cause during the 1970s, including the 1975 Dutch train hostage crisis, the 1975 Indonesian consulate hostage crisis, the 1977 Dutch train hostage crisis, the 1977 Dutch school hostage crisis, and the 1978 Dutch province hall hostage crisis.

On 25 November 1975, Suriname seceded from the Dutch Kingdom and became independent. Representing the Queen at the independence ceremony in the Surinamese capital, Paramaribo, were the heir presumptive Princess Beatrix, and her husband Prince Claus.

Scandal rocked the royal family again in 1976, when it was revealed that Prince Bernhard had accepted a US$1.1 million bribe from U.S. aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Corporation to influence the Dutch government&#x27;s purchase of fighter aircraft in what became known as the Lockheed Scandal.

Prime Minister Joop den Uyl ordered an inquiry into the affair, while Prince Bernhard refused to answer reporters&#x27; questions, stating: &quot;I am above such things.&quot; Rather than calling on the queen to abdicate, the Dutch people were this time fearful that their beloved Juliana might abdicate out of shame or because of a criminal prosecution conducted in her name against her consort.

On 26 August 1976, a censored and toned-down yet devastating report on Prince Bernhard&#x27;s activities was released to a shocked Dutch public. The prince resigned his various high-profile positions as a lieutenant admiral, a general, and an Inspector General of the Armed Forces. He resigned from his positions on the boards of many businesses, charities, the World Wildlife Fund, and other institutions. The prince also accepted that he would have to give up wearing his beloved uniforms. In return, the States-General accepted that there was to be no criminal prosecution.

On her Silver Jubilee in 1973, Queen Juliana donated all of the money that had been raised by the National Silver Jubilee Committee to organizations for children in need throughout the world. She donated the gift from the nation which she received on her seventieth birthday, in 1979, to the &quot;International Year of the Child&quot;. As a reigning European monarch, she was given supernumerary membership of the British Order of the Garter as the 922nd inductee, with the rank of Stranger Lady Companion, in 1958.

On 30 April 1980, her 71st birthday, Queen Juliana abdicated and her eldest daughter succeeded her. Juliana remained active in numerous charitable causes until well into her eighties.

Queen Juliana was very attached to Monte Argentario, in Tuscany, a favorite place for the Dutch royal family for their summer holidays for more than 40 years.

==Illness and death==

From the mid-1990s, Juliana&#x27;s health declined as she suffered the progressive onset of dementia. Juliana did not appear in public after this time. At the order of the Royal Family&#x27;s doctors, Juliana was placed under 24-hour care. Prince Bernhard said in a television interview in 2001 that the former Queen was no longer able to recognise her family and that she had been suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease for several years.

Juliana died in her sleep on 20 March 2004 at the age of 94, at Soestdijk Palace in Baarn from complications of pneumonia, seventy years to the day after her grandmother, Queen Emma. She was embalmed, unlike her mother Wilhelmina, who chose not to be, and on 30 March 2004 interred beside her mother in the royal vaults under the Nieuwe Kerk in Delft. The memorial service made her ecumenical and often highly personal views on matters of religion public. The late Princess, a Pastor said in her sermon, was interested in all religions and in reincarnation. Juliana&#x27;s husband Prince Bernhard died about nine months later aged 93, on 1 December 2004; his remains were placed next to hers.

In 2009, an exhibition of portraits of Juliana, and objects from her life, was held at the Het Loo Palace to mark the centenary of her birth.

==Titles, styles, and arms==
Juliana&#x27;s full title and style as an unmarried woman was: &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot; Princess Juliana Louisa Emma Marie Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, Princess of Orange-Nassau, Duchess of Mecklenburg, etc.

Her mother issued a decree allowing her to adopt her husband&#x27;s princely title as customary, providing that it be preceded by the title she held as a member of the House of Mecklenburg. The decree became effective upon her marriage, and changed her full title and style to: &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot; Princess Juliana of the Netherlands, Princess of Orange-Nassau, Duchess of Mecklenburg, Princess of Lippe-Biesterfeld, etc.

After her accession to the throne, Juliana&#x27;s official title was: &quot;Her Majesty, Juliana, Queen of the Netherlands, Princess of Orange-Nassau, Duchess of Mecklenburg, Princess of Lippe-Biesterfeld, etc, etc, etc&quot;. Upon her abdication, she resumed her pre-regnal marital title and style.

<text>Beatrix (Beatrix Wilhelmina Armgard, ; born 31 January 1938) is a member of the Dutch royal house who reigned as Queen of the Netherlands from 1980 until her abdication in 2013.

Beatrix was born during the reign of her maternal grandmother, Queen Wilhelmina, and became heiress presumptive upon the accession of her mother, Queen Juliana, in 1948. Beatrix attended a public primary school in Canada during World War II, and then finished her primary and secondary education in the Netherlands in the post-war period. In 1961, she received her law degree from Leiden University. In 1966, Beatrix married Claus von Amsberg, a German diplomat, with whom she had three children. When her mother abdicated on 30 April 1980, Beatrix succeeded her as queen.

Beatrix&#x27;s reign saw the country&#x27;s Caribbean possessions reshaped with Aruba&#x27;s secession and becoming its own constituent country within the kingdom in 1986. This was followed by the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles in 2010, which created the new special municipalities of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba, and the two new constituent countries of Curaçao and Sint Maarten.

On Koninginnedag (&quot;Queen&#x27;s Day&quot;), 30 April 2013, Beatrix abdicated in favour of her eldest son, Willem-Alexander. At the time of her abdication at age 75, Beatrix was the oldest reigning monarch in the country&#x27;s history.

==Early life==
Princess Beatrix Wilhelmina Armgard was born on 31 January 1938 at Soestdijk Palace in Baarn, Netherlands, as the first child of Princess Juliana of the Netherlands and her husband, Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld. Beatrix was baptised on 12 May 1938 in the Great Church in The Hague. Her five godparents were King Leopold III of Belgium; Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone; Beatrix&#x27;s maternal great-great-aunt Elisabeth, Princess of Erbach-Schönberg; her paternal great-uncle Duke Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg; and Countess Allene de Kotzebue. Beatrix&#x27;s middle names are the first names of her grandmothers, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands and Armgard, Princess Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld.

When Beatrix was one year old, in 1939, her younger sister Princess Irene was born.
World War II broke out in the Netherlands on 10 May 1940 (Westfeldzug). On 13 May, the Dutch Royal Family evacuated to London, United Kingdom. One month later, Beatrix went to Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, with her mother Juliana and her sister Irene, while her father Bernhard and maternal grandmother Queen Wilhelmina remained in London. The family lived at the Stornoway residence (now the residence of the Leader of the Opposition in the Parliament of Canada). With bodyguards and ladies in waiting, the family summered at Bigwin Inn on Lake of Bays, Ontario, where four private stone cottages of the resort served as their retreat. While on Bigwin Island, the constitution of the Netherlands was stored in the safe of Bigwin Inn&#x27;s rotunda building. Princess Juliana and her family were remembered for their &quot;down to earth&quot; friendliness, general gratefulness and great reverence for their homeland and people, to whom they paid homage by refraining from all luxuries offered to guests at the resort that was once billed as the largest and most luxurious summer resort in Canada. To provide them with a greater sense of security, culinary chefs and staff catered to personal orders at meal time. Upon their departure, the hotel musicians of the Bigwin Inn Orchestra assembled dockside; and at every public performance afterward through to the end of World War II, the &quot;Wilhelmus&quot; was played. In the years following the shuttering and neglect of the island resort, the &quot;Juliana&quot; cottages were well maintained and preserved in an informal tribute to Princess Juliana and her family. In thanks for the protection of her and her daughters, Princess Juliana established the custom of delivery to the Canadian government every spring of tulips, which is the centrepiece of the Canadian Tulip Festival.

The second sister of Beatrix, Princess Margriet, was born in Ottawa in 1943. During their exile in Canada, Beatrix attended nursery and Rockcliffe Park Public School, a primary school where she was known as &quot;Trixie Orange&quot;.

On 5 May 1945, the German troops in the Netherlands surrendered. The family returned to the Netherlands on 2 August 1945. Beatrix went to the progressive primary school &quot;De Werkplaats&quot; in Bilthoven run by pacifist social reformers Kees Boeke and Beatrice Boeke-Cadbury. Her third sister Princess Christina was born in 1947. On 6 September 1948, her mother succeeded her grandmother Wilhelmina as Queen of the Netherlands. Since she had no brothers, Beatrix became the heiress presumptive to the Dutch throne at the age of ten.

==Education==

In April 1950, Princess Beatrix entered the Incrementum, a part of Baarnsch Lyceum, where, in 1956, she passed her school graduation examinations in the subjects of arts and classics. Her tutor from April 1951 was , who remained a close confidant until Büringh Boekhoudt&#x27;s death in 1982.

In 1954, Beatrix served as a bridesmaid at the wedding of Baroness van Randwijck and Mr. T Boey.

On 31 January 1956, Beatrix celebrated her 18th birthday. From that date, under the Constitution of the Netherlands, she was entitled to assume the Royal Prerogative. At that time, her mother installed her in the Council of State.

The same year her studies at Leiden University began. In her first years at the university, she studied sociology, jurisprudence, economics, parliamentary history and constitutional law. In the course of her studies she also attended lectures on the cultures of Suriname and the Netherlands Antilles, the Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands, international affairs, international law, history and European law.

The princess also visited various European and international organisations in Geneva, Strasbourg, Paris, and Brussels. She was also an active member of the VVSL (Female Union for Students in Leiden), now called L.S.V. Minerva, after merging with the Leidsch Studenten Corps (which before then was male-only). In the summer of 1959, she passed her preliminary examination in law, and she obtained her law degree in July 1961.

==Political involvement==
In 1965, Beatrix became engaged to the German aristocrat Claus von Amsberg, a diplomat working for the German Foreign Office. There was a massive protest on their wedding day in Amsterdam on 10 March 1966. Prince Claus had served in the Hitler Youth and the Wehrmacht and therefore was easily associated with German Nazism. Protests included slogans like &quot;&quot;Claus &#x27;raus!&quot; (Claus out!) and &quot;Mijn fiets terug&quot;&quot; (&quot;Return my bicycle&quot; – a reference to German soldiers confiscating Dutch bicycles during WWII). A group of Provos threw a smoke bomb at the Golden Coach, resulting in a street battle with the police.

As time went on, Prince Claus became one of the most popular members of the Dutch monarchy, and his death in 2002 was widely mourned.

On 25 November 1975, Beatrix and Prince Claus attended the independence ceremony of Suriname, held in the new nation&#x27;s capital, Paramaribo, representing her mother the Queen.

As a monarch, Beatrix had weekly meetings with the prime minister. She signed all new Acts of Parliament and royal decrees, and until a constitutional change late in her reign, appointed the &quot;informateur&quot;, an official who is responsible for chairing coalition talks in the formation of new governments. At the state opening of parliament each September, she made a Speech from the Throne, in which the government announced its plans for the coming parliamentary year. As Queen, she was president of the Council of State. Her role was largely ceremonial and as a focus of national unity, she did not make legislative or executive decisions.

Beatrix is a member of the Bilderberg Group.

==Marriage and children==
===Engagement to Claus===
On 28 June 1965, the engagement of Princess Beatrix to the German diplomat Claus von Amsberg was announced. Claus and Beatrix had met at the wedding-eve party of Princess Tatjana of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg and Moritz, Landgrave of Hesse, in summer 1964. After Parliament consented to the marriage, Claus von Amsberg became a Dutch citizen, and upon his marriage became Prince Claus of the Netherlands, Jonkheer van Amsberg.

===Wedding, 1966===
Beatrix married Claus von Amsberg on 10 March 1966 in civil and religious ceremonies. The bride wore a traditional gown with train in duchesse silk satin, designed by Caroline Bergé-Farwick of Maison Linette, in Den Bosch, and the Württemberg Ornate Pearl Tiara. The senior bridesmaids were the bride&#x27;s youngest sister, Princess Christina of the Netherlands; Princess Christina of Sweden; Lady Elizabeth Anson; Joanna Roëll; Eugénie Loudon; and the bridegroom&#x27;s sister, Christina von Amsberg. The junior bridesmaids were Daphne Stewart-Clark and Carolijn Alting von Geusau, with page boys Joachim Jencquel and Markus von Oeynhausen-Sierstorpff.

The royal couple travelled to the ceremony together in the gold state carriage. The civil ceremony was conducted by the Mayor of Amsterdam, Gijsbert van Hall, at Amsterdam City Hall. The marriage blessing took place in the Westerkerk, conducted by the Rev. Hendrik Jan Kater, with a sermon by the Rev. Johannes Hendrik Sillevis Smitt.

===Children===
The royal couple had three sons. They lived at Drakensteyn Castle in Lage Vuursche with their children until Beatrix ascended the throne. In 1981, they moved into Huis ten Bosch Palace in The Hague.
==Accession and inauguration==

From the 1970s, Beatrix began to prepare more intensively for her future position as head of state. She made many trips abroad with Prince Claus, including a controversial one to the Soviet Union.

After the Lockheed affair, Beatrix and Claus began to delve into the royal household and made plans to adapt it. In addition, they asked advisers to prepare for Beatrix&#x27;s reign. On 31 January 1980, the birthday of her eldest daughter and heiress presumptive, Queen Juliana announced during a live television speech that she wished to abdicate on 30 April in favor of her daughter Beatrix.

That Beatrix would succeed her mother as queen was not a matter of course when she was born. It was not until 1983 that the Constitution was amended in such a way that the eldest child of the head of state becomes the legal heir to the throne. Until then, it had been arranged that the eldest son always had priority over a daughter. Only after Juliana was biologically unable to have more children, Beatrix was certain that she was the intended successor.

On 30 April 1980, Beatrix became the monarch when her mother abdicated. She was sworn in and inaugurated as monarch during a joint session of the two chambers of the States General at a ceremony held in the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam later that day.

== Reign ==
Beatrix&#x27;s constitutional duties included those typically accorded to a head of state; this includes having to sign every piece of legislation before it becomes law, formally appointing various officials, receiving and accrediting ambassadors, and awarding honours and medals, among others. Outside of these constitutional duties, her other informal roles included being the highest representative of the kingdom internationally and to be a unifying figure locally.

Beatrix was rarely quoted directly in the press during her reign, for the government information service (&quot;Rijksvoorlichtingsdienst&quot;) made it a condition of interviews that she should not be quoted. This policy was introduced shortly after her inauguration, reportedly to protect her from political complications that might arise from &quot;off-the-cuff&quot; remarks. It did not apply to her son Prince Willem-Alexander.

Throughout much of her reign, Beatrix had a considerable role in the cabinet formation process; notably she appointed the &quot;informateur&quot; and &quot;formateur&quot;, the person who leads the negotiations that ultimately lead to the formation of a government. However, this was changed in 2012, and now the largest party in the States General appoints a &quot;scout&quot; who then appoints an &quot;informateur&quot;.

Beatrix was included in Andy Warhol&#x27;s portrait series in 1985 as one of four &quot;Reigning Queens&quot;, alongside Elizabeth II, Margrethe II of Denmark and Ntfombi of Eswatini.

On 1 January 1986, Aruba seceded from the Netherlands Antilles and became a separate constituent country within the Dutch Kingdom.

===Kissed by a bystander===

During 1988 Queen&#x27;s Day, Queen Beatrix was kissed by a bystander, later identified as Maarten Rijkers, when she walked through the crowd of people at a flea market in the Jordaan. When Beatrix walked alongside Rijkers he said &quot;Give me a kiss, girl&quot;, after which he gave her a hug and two kisses. It received wide media attention and appeared to be a historic moment. An image of this scene was published in large on the front page of &quot;De Telegraaf&quot;. Even 25 years later in 2013, &quot;NRC Handelsblad&quot; wrote an article about it and the impact of it.

The reaction of the Queen was seen by people as very positive and was a boost for her reputation in the &quot;Jordaan&quot; region of Amsterdam. The visit was promoted as a &quot;spontaneous visit&quot; to boost her popularity as she was not very popular in the region. Historian and Dutch royalty watcher J. G. Kikkert said in a lecture that the kiss had been staged, based on what he called &quot;usually very reliable sources&quot;. He also noted that although the visit and the kiss might not have been her idea, but that of others, she certainly would have given her approval as she was known not to leave things to chance.

On 6 October 2002, the Queen&#x27;s husband, Prince Claus, died after a long illness. A year and a half later her mother died after long suffering from senile dementia, while her father succumbed to cancer in December 2004.
On 8 February 2005, Beatrix received a rare honorary doctorate from Leiden University, an honour the Queen does not usually accept. In her acceptance speech she reflected on the monarchy and her own 25 years as Queen. The speech was broadcast live.

On 29 and 30 April 2005, she celebrated the 25th anniversary of her reign. She was interviewed on Dutch television, was offered a concert on Dam Square in Amsterdam, and a celebration took place in The Hague, the country&#x27;s seat of government.

On 31 May 2006 the &quot;6th Polish Air Assault Brigade&quot; would receive the &quot;Militaire Willemsorde der 4e klasse&quot; in The Hague. Beatrix was to tie the prestigious medal to the standard of the incumbents of the 1st Independent Polish Parachute Brigade.

In 2009, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated her wealth at US$300 million.

On 30 April 2009, Beatrix and other members of the royal family were targeted in a car attack by a man named Karst Tates. He crashed his Suzuki Swift into a parade in Apeldoorn, narrowly missing a bus carrying the Queen, before dying as a result of his injuries. Five people were killed instantly, with two victims also succumbing to their injuries afterward. Other victims of the crash were critically hurt. One week after the attack, another victim succumbed to the injuries he had sustained. The royal party was unharmed, but the Queen and members of her family saw the crash at close range. Within hours, Beatrix made a rare televised address to express her shock and condolences. The man reportedly told police he was deliberately targeting the royal family.

== Abdication ==

In a broadcast on national media on 28 January 2013, Beatrix announced her intention to abdicate on 30 April (Koninginnedag), when she would have been on the throne for exactly 33 years. Beatrix stated that it was time to &quot;place the responsibility for the country in the hands of a new generation.&quot; Her heir apparent was her eldest son, Prince Willem-Alexander. She was the third successive Dutch monarch to abdicate, following her grandmother and her mother. The broadcast was followed by a statement from Prime Minister Mark Rutte who paid tribute to Beatrix, saying &quot;Since her investiture in 1980, she has applied herself heart and soul to Dutch society.&quot;

The royal transition, which included the inauguration of Willem-Alexander as king, took place on 30 April 2013.

==Post-abdication==
Beatrix continues to undertake some royal duties and is a patron of many organisations. She lives in the small moated Drakensteyn Castle near the village of Lage Vuursche, and a townhouse near Noordeinde Palace.

==Honorific eponyms==
Beatrix has given her name to a number of facilities in the Netherlands and beyond. These include:
* Streekziekenhuis Koningin Beatrix, regional hospital in Beatrixpark, Winterswijk.
*Queen Beatrix International Airport in Aruba.
* Reina Beatrix School in Aruba.
* Queen Beatrix Hospital Medical Center, Sint Eustatius.
* Queen Beatrix Chair in Dutch Studies at UC Berkeley
* Queen Beatrix Nursing Home, Albion Park Rail, NSW, Australia.

A few parks in the country also bear her name:
* Beatrixpark in the Oud-Zuid neighbourhood in Amsterdam.
* Beatrixpark in Almere.
* Beatrixpark in &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch. 
* Beatrixpark in Utrecht. 
* Beatrixpark in Schiedam.

It has been speculated that Beatrix is De Onbekende Beeldhouwer (Unknown Sculptor), whose work has been appearing in Amsterdam since 1983. There has been no confirmation of this.

==Titles, styles, honours and arms==
*31 January 1938 – 30 April 1980: &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot; Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands, Princess of Orange-Nassau, Princess of Lippe-Biesterfeld
*30 April 1980 – 30 April 2013: &quot;Her Majesty&quot; The Queen of the Netherlands, Princess of Orange-Nassau, Princess of Lippe-Biesterfeld
*30 April 2013 – present: &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot; Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands, Princess of Orange-Nassau, Princess of Lippe-Biesterfeld

Princess Beatrix has held titles throughout her life, as a granddaughter or daughter of a monarch, and eventually as the Sovereign. Beatrix&#x27;s official title was &quot;Her Majesty the Queen of the Netherlands, Princess of Orange-Nassau, etc., etc., etc&quot;. The triple &quot;etc.&quot; refers to the monarch&#x27;s many dormant titles. She signed official documents with only &quot;Beatrix&quot;. In common parlance, she was referred to as &quot;The Queen&quot; (&quot;de koningin&quot; or &quot;de vorstin&quot;) or &quot;Her Majesty&quot; (Hare Majesteit). But when in conversation with the queen the practice was to initially address her as &quot;Your Majesty&quot; or in Dutch as &quot;Uwe Majesteit&quot; and thereafter as &quot;Mevrouw&quot; (ma&#x27;am).

Beatrix has received honours and awards from countries around the world, both during her life as a princess and as a monarch. In her capacity as the Sovereign she was Grand Master of the Military Order of William (&quot;Militaire Willemsorde&quot;) and the other Dutch orders of merit. She is a Stranger Lady of the Most Noble Order of the Garter and the 1,187th Dame of the Order of the Golden Fleece in Spain, and she has received numerous other medals and decorations.

From birth till her inauguration as queen, she had the following name and titles, to which she reverted after her abdication: &quot;Her Royal Highness Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands, Princess of Orange-Nassau, Princess of Lippe-Biesterfeld&quot;.

<text>Alexis Argüello (April 19, 1952 – July 1, 2009) was a Nicaraguan professional boxer who competed from 1968 to 1995, and later became a politician. He was a three-weight world champion, having held the WBA featherweight title from 1974 to 1976; the WBC super featherweight title from 1978 to 1980; and the WBC lightweight title from 1981 to 1982. Additionally, he held the &quot;Ring&quot; magazine and lineal featherweight titles from 1975 to 1977; the &quot;Ring&quot; lightweight title from 1981 to 1982; and the lineal lightweight title in 1982. In his later career, he challenged twice for light welterweight world titles, losing both times in famous fights against Aaron Pryor.

Argüello has regularly been cited as one of the greatest boxers of his era, having never lost any of his world titles in the ring, instead relinquishing them each time in pursuit of titles in higher weight classes. After his retirement from boxing, he became active in Nicaraguan politics and in November 2008 was elected mayor of his native Managua, the nation&#x27;s capital city.

&quot;The Ring&quot; magazine has ranked Argüello as 20th on their list of &quot;100 greatest punchers of all time&quot;, while the Associated Press ranked him as the world&#x27;s best Junior Lightweight of the 20th century. He was named one of the 20 greatest fighters of the past 80 years by &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine and is widely regarded as one of the greatest boxers to ever come out of Latin America and one of the few to have fought in four different decades.

== Early life and amateur career ==
Argüello was born April 19, 1952. His father was a shoemaker. His mother&#x27;s name was Zoila. Argüello had a troubled childhood, growing up in abject poverty in Managua. When he was 5 years old, his father attempted suicide. At the age of 9, Argüello ran away to work in a dairy farm. When he was 13, he emigrated to Canada to provide for his family. Argüello was constantly involved in street brawls through his teenage years, but it wasn&#x27;t until his sister Marina, one of Alexis&#x27; 7 siblings, married a boxer that young Alexis took an interest in the sport. Argüello&#x27;s brief amateur career saw him compile a 58–2 record.

At one time, his brother Eduardo José was considered a national hero in Nicaragua and had a street named after him.

== Boxing career ==
=== Featherweight ===
Argüello debuted on October 26, 1968, trained by former boxer Miguel Angel Rivas. After winning his first 3 fights, &quot;The Explosive Thin Man&quot; suffered an unavenged fourth-round KO loss, followed by another split decision loss. Argüello would then win 29 of his next 30 bouts over the next 5 years, including a win over José Legrá. Eventually, Argüello earned a world featherweight championship bout against experienced WBA champion Ernesto Marcel. The fight took place in Panama, Marcel&#x27;s home country. The young challenger lost a 15-round unanimous decision in the champion&#x27;s retirement bout. Months after Marcel&#x27;s retirement, the WBA featherweight title was won by former unified bantamweight champion Rubén Olivares.

Undaunted, Argüello put together another streak of wins and found himself contending for the WBA featherweight, this time against Olivares in the latter&#x27;s first defense. The fight took place at The Forum in Inglewood on November 23, 1974. After Olivares had built a small lead on the judges&#x27; scorecards, Argüello and Olivares landed simultaneous left hooks in round thirteen. Olivares&#x27;s left hand caused a visible expression of pain on Argüello&#x27;s face, but Argüello&#x27;s left hand caused Olivares to crash hard against the canvas. A few seconds later, Argüello was the new featherweight champion of the world.

Argüello&#x27;s first defense came against Venezuelan featherweight champion Leonel Hernández. Once again, Argüello fought in enemy territory, as the fight took place in Caracas. Nevertheless, Argüello made short work of his challenger, stopping him by technical knockout in the 8th round. His first defense in Nicaragua was against Rigoberto Riasco. Argüello dominated once again, this time stopping Riasco in the second round. Next up for Argüello would be Royal Kobayashi, a highly touted Japanese challenger who was undefeated until then. After a tense, close start, Argüello&#x27;s relentless body-punching broke Kobayashi halfway through the fifth round, with the challenger dropping to the canvas twice.

=== Junior lightweight ===
After a successful fourth defense, Argüello moved up in weight to challenge world junior lightweight champion Alfredo Escalera in Bayamón, Puerto Rico, in what has been nicknamed &quot;The Bloody Battle of Bayamon&quot; by many. Escalera had been a busy champion with ten defenses, and he had dethroned Kuniaki Shibata in 2 rounds in Tokyo. In what some experts (including &quot;The Ring&quot; writers) consider one of the most brutal fights in history, Escalera had his eye, mouth and nose broken early but was rallying back in the scorecards when Argüello finished him, once again in the thirteenth round.

His reign at Junior Lightweight saw him fend off the challenges of Escalera in a rematch held at Rimini, Italy, as well as former and future world champion Bobby Chacon, future two-time world champion Rafael &quot;Bazooka&quot; Limón, Ruben Castillo, future champion Rolando Navarrete, and Diego Alcalá, beaten in only one round.

Argüello suffered many cuts around his face during his second victory against Escalera. The on-site doctor wanted him hospitalized, but Argüello had a flight to catch from Rome the next day to return to Nicaragua, and he boarded a train from Rimini. The doctor decided to travel with Argüello, and performed plastic surgery on Argüello&#x27;s cuts with Argüello awake.

=== Lightweight ===
After eight successful title defenses, Argüello then moved up in weight again, and this time, he had to go to London, England, to challenge world lightweight champion Jim Watt. Watt lasted fifteen rounds, but the judges gave Argüello a unanimous 15-round decision, thus making him only the sixth boxer to win world titles in three divisions and the second Latin American (after Wilfred Benítez had become the first by beating Maurice Hope one month before) to do it. He had to face some lesser-known challengers in this division, one exception being the famous prospect Ray Mancini (known as &quot;Boom Boom&quot;). Mancini and Argüello engaged in a fight that was later showcased in a boxing video of the best fights of the 1980s, with Argüello prevailing by stoppage when he decked Mancini in round 14. After the fight, Argüello gained many American fans when he embraced Mancini and told a CBS television audience that he would do anything to help Mancini&#x27;s father, who at the time was dealing with illness. Andrew Ganigan proved to be one of Argüello&#x27;s toughest challenges as he dropped Argüello in the second round, but ultimately, the defending champion prevailed by stopping Ganigan in the fifth.

=== Junior welterweight ===
==== Battles with Aaron Pryor ====

Argüello successfully defended his lightweight title four times. After defeating James &#x27;Bubba&#x27; Busceme by sixth round stoppage, Argüello decided to move up in weight class again, and on November 12, 1982, he tried to become the first world champion in four different categories, meeting the heavier and future Hall-of-Famer Aaron Pryor, in what was billed as &quot;The Battle of the Champions&quot; in Miami, Florida. Argüello was stopped in the 14th round. The fight sparked controversy because Pryor&#x27;s trainer, Panama Lewis, introduced a second water bottle, which he described as &quot;the bottle I mixed&quot; after round 13, leading to speculation that the bottle was tainted. The Florida State Boxing Commission failed to administer a post-fight urinalysis, adding to speculation that the bottle contained an unsanctioned substance. Lewis claimed at various times that the bottle was filled with peppermint schnapps or Perrier to help Pryor deal with an upset stomach. It was later revealed in an interview with former Lewis-trained boxer Luis Resto that Lewis would break apart antihistamine pills used to treat asthma and pour the medicine into the water, giving Lewis&#x27;s fighter greater lung capacity in the later rounds of a fight. Others say that there was a mixture of cocaine, honey and orange juice in the bottle.

A rematch was ordered. This time, in Las Vegas, Argüello was KO-ed in the tenth and stated after the fight, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to fight anymore. I quit.&quot; But he later returned to the ring for financial reasons.

===Comeback and post-retirement===
During the 1980s, Argüello briefly fought with the Contras in his native Nicaragua, but after a few months in the jungle, he retired from the war. He then attempted several comebacks into boxing during the late 1980s and early 1990s and had some success, most notably a fourth round stoppage of former World Junior Welterweight Champion Billy Costello in a 1986 televised bout that put him in a position for another shot at the Junior Welterweight title. He retired for good in 1995 with a record of 82 wins, 8 losses, and 65 KOs, along with the recognition of being one of the sport&#x27;s most universally respected fighters among fans, experts, and boxers.

Argüello was elected to the International Boxing Hall Of Fame in 1992. In 2008, he was honored by being selected as Nicaragua&#x27;s flag-bearer at the Opening Ceremony of the Beijing Olympics.

==Political career==
Argüello was actively involved in Nicaraguan politics with the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN)--the same party against whom he took up arms in the 1980s—and in 2004 was elected vice-mayor of Managua. Amid accusations of vote-rigging, Argüello narrowly won the mayoral election in Managua on November 9, 2008 against the candidate of the Constitutionalist Liberal Party, Eduardo Montealegre, who had come second to Daniel Ortega in the 2006 presidential election. Argüello&#x27;s margin of victory was narrow as he attained just 51.30% of the vote.
==Acting==
Arguello had a large supporting role in the 1989 film, &quot;Fists of Steel&quot;.

==Death==

Argüello died on July 1, 2009, after being accused of shooting himself with two bullets through the heart in Managua. The national police, under Sandinista control, confirmed the death shortly afterward, and it was declared a suicide following an autopsy.

Those close to Argüello, including his daughter Dora Arguello and his sons, asserted that he was killed by Ortega&#x27;s regime because he had become increasingly disenchanted with the &quot;Orteguistas&quot; and the Sandinista government, and was planning an imminent departure from the Sandinista political party.

<doc id="80488" wikidata="Q497311" url="?curid=80488" title="Spellbound (1945 film)">
<text>Spellbound is a 1945 American psychological thriller film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and starring Ingrid Bergman, Gregory Peck, and Michael Chekhov. It follows a psychoanalyst who falls in love with the new head of the Vermont hospital in which she works, only to find that he is an imposter suffering dissociative amnesia, and potentially, a murderer. The film is based on the 1927 novel &quot;The House of Dr. Edwardes&quot; by Hilary Saint George Saunders and John Palmer.

Filming of &quot;Spellbound&quot; took place in the summer of 1944 in Vermont, Utah, and Los Angeles. &quot;Spellbound&quot; was released theatrically in New York City on Halloween 1945, after which its U.S. release expanded on December 28, 1945. The film received favorable reviews from critics and was a major box-office success, grossing $6.4 million in the United States, and breaking ticket sales records in London. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including for Best Picture and Best Director, and won in the category of Best Original Score.

==Plot==
Dr. Constance Petersen is a psychoanalyst at Green Manors, a mental hospital in Vermont, accused by an unsuccessful suitor colleague of being icy and unemotional. The hospital&#x27;s director, Dr. Murchison, is forced into retirement shortly after returning from an absence due to nervous exhaustion. His replacement, Dr. Anthony Edwardes, turns out to be surprisingly young. Uncharacteristically, Petersen is immediately smitten with Edwardes, who returns her feelings.

While kissing him, Petersen notices that Edwardes has a peculiar phobia about sets of parallel lines against a white background, displayed on several occasions. She compares his signature with an autographed copy of one of his books, realizing when they do not match that he is an impostor. He confides to her that he has killed the real Edwardes, who was treating him, and taken his place. Suffering from amnesia, he does not know who he really is, but they deduce that he is a doctor when he displays medical knowledge. Petersen believes he is an innocent man with a guilt complex. Overnight, he disappears. Edwardes&#x27; assistant arrives and discloses that the Edwardes who spoke to her on the phone is an impostor, and that the real Edwardes is ominously missing.

Petersen tracks the impostor to a New York City hotel, where he is living under the pseudonym &quot;John Brown&quot;. Despite his insistence that she leave, she convinces him that psychoanalysis can recover his memories. The two travel to Rochester, New York, and stay with Dr. Alexander Brulov, Petersen&#x27;s former mentor and friend.

The two psychoanalysts interpret a dream that &quot;Brown&quot; describes. He is playing cards in a mysterious club when a scantily clad woman resembling Petersen starts kissing everybody there. His card partner, an older man, is accused of cheating and threatened by the club&#x27;s masked proprietor. The scene changes to the older man standing on the precipice of a sloped roof and falling off. The proprietor is found to be standing behind a chimney and dropping a wheel he held in his hand. &quot;Brown&#x27;s&quot; dream concludes with him chased down a hill by a great pair of wings.

&quot;Brown&#x27;s&quot; phobia of dark lines on white represents ski tracks in the snow, and the older man in his dream is the real Edwardes, who died in a skiing accident. The detail of the wings they deduce to represent Gabriel Valley ski lodge. &quot;Brown&quot; and Petersen travel there to recreate the circumstances of Edwardes&#x27; death. However, &quot;Brown&quot; fears that, if he really was Edwardes&#x27; murderer, he may impulsively kill again in the same situation.

As they ski down the slope, &quot;Brown&quot; remembers details of his former life: he has a guilt complex, rooted in a childhood accident where he accidentally killed his brother by sliding down a roof and knocking him onto a spiked fence. He also recognizes the cliff where Edwardes fell off, and then &quot;Brown&quot; recalls his own real name: John Ballantyne. Petersen and Ballantyne later meet with the police, who find Edwardes&#x27; body with Ballantyne&#x27;s directions. However, the corpse has a bullet wound in his back. Ballantyne is arrested, tried, and convicted of murder.

Heartbroken, Petersen returns to Green Manors. Murchison, once again the director, lets slip that he knew Edwardes slightly and disliked him, contradicting his earlier statement that they had never met. This inspires Petersen to re-examine her notes of Ballantyne&#x27;s dream: the masked proprietor represents Murchison and the wheel represents a revolver. Murchison therefore murdered Edwardes and left the gun on the ski slope.

Confronting Murchison to prove her hunch, Petersen gets him to admit that the man in the dream likely represents himself. She presents her accusation, and Murchison replies that she got every detail right but one: he still has the revolver and draws it on her. Calmly, Petersen points out that while he could plead insanity and get a lesser charge for Edwardes&#x27; murder, shooting her in cold blood would guarantee his execution. With the gun still pointed at her, she leaves the office to phone the police, before Murchison turns the gun and shoots himself.

Petersen and Ballantyne, now married, receive well-wishes from Dr. Brulov before departing on their honeymoon at Grand Central Terminal.

&quot;Spellbound&quot; was made over contract disagreements between Alfred Hitchcock and producer David O. Selznick. Hitchcock&#x27;s contract with Selznick began in March 1939, but only resulted in three films: &quot;Rebecca&quot; (1940), &quot;Spellbound&quot; and &quot;The Paradine Case&quot; (1947) (he made seven other films during that period under loan-out deals to other studios, including 1946&#x27;s &quot;Notorious&quot; which was sold to RKO in mid-production.) Selznick had wanted Hitchcock to make a film based upon Selznick&#x27;s own positive experience with psychoanalysis; Selznick, at Hitchcock&#x27;s suggestion, purchased the rights to the 1927 novel &quot;The House of Dr. Edwardes&quot; by Hilary St. George Saunders and John Palmer (who had co-written it under the pseudonym Francis Beeding), for approximately $40,000.

In December 1943, Hitchcock and his wife, Alma Reville, began working on a treatment of the novel, and consulted prominent British psychologists and psychoanalysts so as to accurately represent the psychological elements of the story. However, the following month, in January 1944, Hitchcock hired Angus MacPhail, with whom he had collaborated on several war-related short films, to co-author the treatment. MacPhail was ultimately given the adaptation credit, and the extent to which Reville was involved in the final product is unknown. Following the completion of the treatment, screenwriter Ben Hecht began writing the screenplay.

Between May and July 1944, Selznick submitted numerous drafts of Hecht&#x27;s screenplay for approval from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), which objected to various words and phrases in it, including &quot;sex menace,&quot; &quot;frustrations,&quot; &quot;libido,&quot; and &quot;tomcat.&quot; This resulted in some alterations in the screenplay, including the removal of most of a character named Mary Carmichael, a violent nymphomaniac at Green Manors. However, the suicide of Dr. Murchison in the screenplay—which typically violated the MPAA&#x27;s rules against depicting suicide—was allowed to remain, as it was reasoned by Selznick that the character was clearly &quot;of unsound mind,&quot; rendering him an exception.

===Casting===

Selznick originally wanted Joseph Cotten, Dorothy McGuire, and Paul Lukas to play the roles ultimately portrayed by Peck, Bergman, and Chekhov, respectively. Greta Garbo was considered for the role of Dr. Constance Petersen. Hitchcock wanted Joseph Cotten to portray Dr. Murchison. Selznick also wanted Jennifer Jones to portray Dr. Petersen but Hitchcock objected.

===Filming===
Selznick brought in his own therapist, May Romm, MD, to serve as a technical advisor on the production. Dr. Romm and Hitchcock clashed frequently.

Further contention was caused by the hiring of surrealist artist Salvador Dalí to conceive certain scenes in the film&#x27;s key dream sequence. However, the sequence conceived and designed by Dalí and Hitchcock, once translated to film, proved to be too lengthy and complicated for Selznick, so the vast majority of what had been filmed ultimately was edited out. Two minutes of the dream sequence appear in the final film, but according to Ingrid Bergman, the original had been twenty minutes long. The cut footage apparently is now considered lost footage, although some production stills have survived in the Selznick archives. Eventually, Selznick hired William Cameron Menzies, who had worked on &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;, to oversee the set designs and direct the sequence. Hitchcock himself had very little to do with its actual filming.

Both Bergman and Peck were married to others at the time of production—Bergman to Petter Aron Lindström, and Peck to Greta Kukkonen—but they had a brief affair during filming. Their secret relationship became public knowledge when Peck confessed to Brad Darrach of &quot;People&quot; in an interview in 1987, five years after Bergman&#x27;s death. &quot;All I can say is that I had a fiery kinda love for her, and I think that&#x27;s where I ought to stop... I was young. She was young. We were involved for weeks in close and intense work.&quot;

Hitchcock&#x27;s cameo appearance in the film occurs approximately at the forty-minute mark, when he can be seen exiting an elevator at the Empire State Hotel, carrying a violin case and smoking a cigarette. The trailer for &quot;Spellbound&quot;″s original theatrical release in America highlighted this cameo of Hitchcock&#x27;s, showing the footage twice and even freeze-framing Hitchcock&#x27;s brief appearance while a narrator points out that the ordinary-looking man in the footage is the director.

&quot;Spellbound&quot; was shot in black and white, except for two frames of bright red at the conclusion, when Dr. Murchison&#x27;s gun is fired into the camera. This detail was deleted in most 16mm and video formats but was restored for the film&#x27;s DVD release and airings on Turner Classic Movies.

Parts of the film were shot in Alta, Utah at the Alta Lodge and Wasatch Ranch. The film&#x27;s picnic sequence between Peck and Bergmans&#x27; characters was filmed at the Cooper Ranch in Northridge, Los Angeles, while other sequences—such as the train depot scene—were filmed on the Universal Studios lot.

===Music===
The film features an orchestral score by Miklós Rózsa that pioneered the use of the theremin, performed by Dr. Samuel Hoffmann. Selznick originally wanted Bernard Herrmann, but when Herrmann became unavailable, Rózsa was hired and eventually won the Oscar for his score. Although Rózsa considered &quot;Spellbound&quot; to contain some of his best work, he said &quot;Alfred Hitchcock didn&#x27;t like the music — said it got in the way of his direction. I haven&#x27;t seen him since.&quot; In his autobiography, Rózsa wrote that he was saddened that Hitchcock had not congratulated him, or even attempted to contact him, for winning an Oscar for his film&#x27;s score.

During the film&#x27;s protracted post-production, considerable disagreement arose about the music, exacerbated by a lack of communication between producer, director, and composer. Rózsa had scored another film, &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot;, before &quot;Spellbound&quot; was released and had used the theremin in that score as well. This led to allegations that he had recycled music from Selznick&#x27;s film in the Paramount production. Meanwhile, Selznick&#x27;s assistant tampered with the &quot;Spellbound&quot; scoring by replacing some of Rózsa&#x27;s material with earlier music by Franz Waxman and Roy Webb. The tangled history of the scoring process has been explored by Jack Sullivan (&quot;Hitchcock&#x27;s Music&quot;, 2006) and especially Nathan Platte (&quot;Making Music in Selznick&#x27;s Hollywood&quot;, 2018), both of which qualify and sometimes contradict the early accounts of the participants.

Rózsa&#x27;s music achieved great popularity outside the film. Selznick&#x27;s innovative use of promotional recordings for radio broadcast made the themes familiar and eventually inspired Rózsa to prepare a full-scale &quot;Spellbound Concerto&quot; for piano, theremin, and orchestra. This work became a popular staple in the movie concerto genre and has received multiple recordings. Intrada Records made the first recording of the film&#x27;s complete score with the Slovak Radio Symphony Orchestra. This album also included music not heard in the finished film.

==Release==
===Box office===

Upon the film&#x27;s British release, it broke every box office record in London, in both famous theaters, Pavilion and Tivoli Strand, for a single day, week, month, holiday and Sundays.

===Home media===
In 1999, Anchor Bay Entertainment released &quot;Spellbound&quot; for the first time on DVD. The Criterion Collection subsequently issued a DVD release in 2002. In 2012, MGM Home Entertainment released the film on Blu-ray.

===Radio adaptations===
&quot;Spellbound&quot; was performed as a one-hour radio adaptation on &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; on March 8, 1948. On January 25, 1951 &quot;Screen Directors Playhouse&quot; also did a one-hour adaptation. Both versions starred Joseph Cotten.

===Critical response===
&quot;Newsweek&#x27;s&quot; review evaluated the film as &quot;a superior and suspenseful melodrama;&quot; Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the story was &quot;a rather obvious and often-told tale ... but the manner and quality of its telling is extraordinarily fine ... the firm texture of the narration, the flow of continuity and dialogue, the shock of the unexpected, the scope of image—all are happily here.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that Bergman gave a &quot;beautiful characterization&quot; and that Peck &quot;handles the suspense scenes with great skill and has one of his finest screen roles to date.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; wrote: &quot;Very good! ... The performances of the entire cast are superior, and throughout the action an overtone of suspense and terror, tinged with touches of deep human interest and appealing romance, is sustained.&quot; John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that &quot;when the film stops trying to be esoteric and abandons arcane mumbling for good, rousing melodrama, it moves along in the manner to which Hitchcock has accustomed us ... Fortunately, the English expert hasn&#x27;t forgotten any of his tricks. He still has a nice regard for supplementary characters, and he uses everything from train whistles to grand orchestral crescendos to maintain excitement at a shrill pitch ... All in all, you&#x27;d better see this one.&quot;

&quot;Spellbound&quot; placed fifth on &quot;Film Daily&quot;&#x27;s annual poll of 559 critics across the United States naming the best films of the year.

Rotten Tomatoes rates the film 85% fresh, based on 40 reviews. Its critical consensus says: &quot;&quot;Spellbound&quot;&#x27;s exploration of the subconscious could have benefitted from more analysis, but Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s psychedelic flourishes elevate this heady thriller along with Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck&#x27;s star power&quot;.

On September 28, 2018, Jake Wilson of &quot;The Age&quot; put &quot;Spellbound&quot; on his &quot;top five&quot; list, observing: &quot;Today this seems above all a forward-thinking portrait of a woman battling for authority in a man&#x27;s world.&quot;

<doc id="80493" wikidata="Q268055" url="?curid=80493" title="Henry V (1944 film)">
<text>Henry V is a 1944 British Technicolor epic film adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s play of the same title. The on-screen title is The Chronicle History of King Henry the Fift with his battell fought at Agincourt in France (derived from the title of the 1600 quarto edition of the play, though changing the spelling from &quot;Agin Court&quot;). It stars Laurence Olivier, who also served as a director. The play was adapted for the screen by Olivier, Dallas Bower, and Alan Dent. The score was composed by William Walton.

The film was made near the end of World War II and was intended as a morale booster for Britain. Consequently, it was partly funded by the British government. The film was originally &quot;dedicated to the &#x27;Commandos and Airborne Troops of Great Britain the spirit of whose ancestors it has been humbly attempted to recapture. The film won Olivier an Academy Honorary Award for &quot;his Outstanding achievement as actor, producer and director in bringing Henry V to the screen.&quot;

==Plot==
(The action moves from a performance of the play, &quot;Henry V&quot;, in 1600, transitioning to the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, then back to the play.)

A panorama of London in 1600 is shown and then the viewpoint travels to the Globe Theatre where the audience is being seated. The Chorus enters and implores the audience to use their imagination to visualise the setting of the play. Then is seen, up on a balcony, two clergymen, the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Ely, discussing the current affairs of state. Henry then enters, and discusses with his nobles the state of France. A gift is delivered to Henry from the French Dauphin. The gift turns out to be tennis balls, a jibe at Henry&#x27;s youth and inexperience. Offended, Henry sends the French ambassador away, and prepares to claim the French throne, a throne that he believes is rightfully his.

Then characters from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV&quot; plays, Corporal Nym, Bardolph, and Pistol, are shown. These characters resolve to join Henry&#x27;s army; however, before they do, Falstaff, another returning character, and one of the King&#x27;s former mentors, dies. At this point, the action moves to Southampton and out of the Globe.

At Southampton, the fleet embarks, and lands in France, beginning a campaign that tears through France to Harfleur, to which Henry&#x27;s forces lay siege. At the siege, Henry delivers his first rousing speech to his troops: &quot;Once more... unto the breach! Dear friends, once more!&quot; The troops charge on Harfleur, and take it as their own.

The troops then march to Agincourt, meeting the French forces. The night before the impending battle, Henry wanders around the camp in disguise, to find out what the men think of him. The next day, before the battle, Henry delivers his famous Saint Crispin&#x27;s Day speech.

The action transitions from the Globe to the fields of the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. The English archers let forth a volley of arrows that cuts deeply into the French numbers. The French, weighed down by their heavy armour, are caught in the fresh mud of the field, and are bogged down, which gives the English troops ample opportunity to ride out and fight them on equal terms. The French Dauphin, seeing this disadvantage, watches as several bodyguards and noblemen including the Constable of France ride toward the English camp and kill all the boys and squires, prompting a tearful Fluellen to cry that &quot;this is expressly against the law of arms&quot;. Henry is angered by this and rides out to meet the French Constable, whom he defeats in personal combat.

The battle is won. Henry comes to discuss peace and then woos the Princess Katherine. His success means that France is now under the control of England, as the French King, Charles VI, adopts Henry as his successor. In the final moments, the viewpoint returns to the Globe Theatre and the play, where the actors take their bows.

==Cast==
==Production==
Winston Churchill instructed Olivier to fashion the film as morale-boosting propaganda for British troops fighting World War II. The making and release of the film coincided with the Allied invasion of Normandy and push into France. An early preview trailer of the film showed contemporary London just before cutting to the film&#x27;s aerial footage of London in 1600. The film was meant to cost £350,000 but ended up costing nearly £500,000.

===Setting===
Much of the film&#x27;s impact comes from the vivid Technicolor cinematography (using the only Technicolor camera in England at the time), spectacular period costumes and a unique blend of stylized settings, miniatures and location shooting. The film begins with a handbill floating out of the sky setting the date—the first of May 1600–and the occasion. This dissolves into a tremendously detailed miniature model of London, with boats moving on the Thames. The camera pulls away from the Tower, gleaming white in the sun, and moves past London Bridge (crowded with buildings) to aim across the river at the densely packed city studded with churches, stretching into the distance, until St. Paul&#x27;s (as it was then) can be seen. The camera pauses for a beat and then moves back to zoom in on one of the two round theatres, where a man is raising a flag inscribed The Globe Playhouse, showing that a performance is imminent. Then we go into the theatre for a vivid recreation of a production of the play as performed at that time, complete with hecklers and an annoying rain shower. The Chorus (a single actor) invokes the audience&#x27;s imaginations, and when the action in the play moves to Southampton, we enter the world of the Trés Riches Heures of the Duc de Berry, a late medieval Book of Hours. Costumes and hair styles are authentic, and female parts are now played by women, as when Mistress Quickly delivers the news of Falstaff&#x27;s death and joins other women in farewelling the soldiers.

The Chorus now invokes our imagination to fly past the fleet, barely visible far below in a Channel filled with fog, to the court of France, where Charles VI is attended by various nobles, including the &quot;Duke of Berri&quot;, who is examining an illuminated volume with a magnifying glass in one hand and a clove-studded orange pomander in the other.

The setting becomes more natural in the dark night before Agincourt, when Henry walks through the sleeping camp to see how it goes with his men. The Battle of Agincourt takes place in a realistic setting (filmed in Ireland), in natural fields and forests, and dialogue is delivered from the backs of restive chargers. The troops singing Non Nobis and Te Deum at Henry&#x27;s bidding march toward a painted rendition of the château, which fades out and fades in to the same image, blanketed in deep snow. The next set is a near-perfect rendition of the often-reproduced February page from the Trés Riches Heures, with Pistol taking the place of the man warming himself in the cottage (but with greater modesty).

We next see the negotiations for the Treaty of Troyes, and the setting is used to great effect to clarify and increase the impact of the Duke of Burgundy&#x27;s speech about the sorry state of France. Although it is spring, the camera moves out through a window to pan over a painting of the neglected countryside, specifically illustrating each line of the speech and pausing on the neglected children before panning back up to the château. Henry&#x27;s courtship of Princess Katherine weaves through a lacework of Gothic arches and is followed by their marriage. To the sound of a choir, backs to the camera, garbed in magnificent cloaks, they walk to their thrones. Cut abruptly to the Globe and a closeup on the actor playing Henry, the sound of applause and a pan to the boy playing Katherine (quite effectively) as they stand in gold painted capes with the rest of the cast kneeling in a tableau on either side of them.

The Chorus draws the curtain and speaks his epilogue, the camera pans up to the boychoir singing on the balcony and then cuts to the musicians in the gallery above them and moves further up to the narrow porch where a man brings down the flag and takes it inside. Cut to the model. The camera pulls all the way back and a handbill flies into view. The credits roll by, but before the picture ends we return to the model one last time as &quot;The End&quot; appears over a shot of the Tower of London gleaming white on the banks of the Thames.

===Screenplay===
Olivier intentionally left out some of Henry&#x27;s harsher actions as Shakespeare portrayed them – such as his remorseless beheading of the three Southampton Plot traitors: Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge; Henry Scrope, 3rd Baron Scrope of Masham; and Sir Thomas Grey; his threat to unleash his troops to rape and pillage Harfleur if the city refused to surrender; the cutting of the throats of French prisoners during the battle at Agincourt; as well as his refusal to stop the hanging of his old friend Bardolph for looting. The Chorus&#x27; last speech contains a melancholy reference to what came after and is not in the film:

:Henry the Sixth, in infant bands crown&#x27;d King
:Of France and England, did this king succeed;
:Whose state so many had the managing,
:That they lost France and made his England bleed:
A further scene was added to the play, in which Falstaff, on his death bed, imagines again his rejection by King Henry, which occurs in &quot;Henry IV Part 2.&quot; A recording of Olivier speaking lines from that play is heard.

===Casting===
Hundreds of locals were hired as extras for the Agincourt battle scenes filmed in neutral Ireland in 1943. The production company paid an additional pound to anyone who brought his own horse.

Olivier agreed not to appear in another film for 18 months to reduce any detraction from the promotion of &quot;Henry V&quot;. In return, he was paid £15,000, tax-free (about £460,000 in today&#x27;s money).

Esmond Knight, who plays the patriotic Welsh soldier Fluellen was a wounded veteran of the war. He had been badly injured in 1941 while on active service on board when she was attacked by the , and remained totally blind for two years. He had only just regained some sight in his right eye.

===Filming===

The film was shot on location at the Powerscourt Estate in Enniskerry, County Wicklow, Ireland. The interior sets were constructed at the Denham Studios in Buckinghamshire, England. They were based on illustrations from the Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry the illustrator of which is also a character in the play.

The film, which was photographed in three-strip Technicolor, was hailed by critics for its ebulliently colourful sets and costumes, as well as for Olivier&#x27;s masterful direction and acting. Pauline Kael called the movie &quot;a triumph of color, music, spectacle and soaring heroic poetry&quot;. James Agee reported, in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 8 April 1946 issue, that a remarkable 75 percent of the color footage shot was used in the final release.

In 2007, the film was digitally restored to High Definition format and re-released. As part of the BBC Summer of British Film series in 2007, it was shown at selected cinemas across the UK.

===Film music===

The score by William Walton is considered one of the greatest British film scores, and excerpts from it, such as the orchestral &quot;Suite from Henry V&quot;, have been performed in concert.

A recording of the score arranged by Christopher Palmer, with actor Christopher Plummer reading the speeches given by the Chorus, Henry V, and the Duke of Burgundy, was released in 1990 under the title &quot;Henry V: A Shakespeare Scenario&quot;. The score incorporates elements from a well-known vocal adaptation of French folk-songs called &quot;Chants d&#x27;Auvergne&quot; by Joseph Canteloube. Ralph Vaughan Williams had also suggested tunes to Walton that he had used in his brass band overture &#x27;Henry V&#x27; of 1933 including &#x27;Agincourt Song&#x27;, &#x27;Reveillez-vous, Picards&#x27; (Old French Marching Song) and William Byrd&#x27;s &#x27;The Earl of Oxford&#x27;s March&#x27; all of which Walton used. The 2007 re-release of Sir Neville Marriner&#x27;s recording of the score also includes original versions of earlier music by composers whose works were incorporated into the score, including selections from Canteloube&#x27;s &quot;Chants d&#x27;Auvergne&quot;.

==Reception==
According to Turner Classic Movies&#x27;s Frank Miller, Olivier&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot; was the first Shakespeare film to receive &quot;both critical and popular acclaim.&quot; The British critics gave it a lukewarm welcome but word of mouth took care of that, and the film broke all records by running for 11 months in London. In 1946, a cagey release strategy in the United States was undoubtedly helped by the &quot;ecstatic&quot; reviews from U.S. critics, &quot;hailing it as one of the screen&#x27;s first great works of art and the most impressive directing debut since Orson Welles&#x27; &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941).&quot;

Miller adds that &quot;Olivier won Best Actor awards from the New York Film Critics Circle and the National Review, also capturing the latter&#x27;s Best Picture award and coming within a few votes of beating &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; (1946) for the New York Film Critics Award in that category.&quot;

Writing in The New Republic, film critic Manny Farber offered this appraisal of Olivier&#x27;s performance:

The film was highly acclaimed around the world. James Agee, who reviewed it separately for three publications, called it &quot;one of the cinema&#x27;s great works of art&quot;.

===Box office===
According to &quot;Kinematograph Weekly&quot; the &#x27;biggest winner&#x27; at the box office in 1945 Britain was &quot;The Seventh Veil&quot;, with &quot;runners up&quot; being (in release order), &quot;Madonna of the Seven Moons&quot;, &quot;Old Acquaintance&quot;, &quot;Frenchman&#x27;s Creek&quot;, &quot;Mrs Parkington&quot;, &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot;, &quot;Meet Me in St Louis&quot;, &quot;A Song to Remember&quot;, &quot;Since You Went Away&quot;, &quot;Here Come the Waves&quot;, &quot;Tonight and Every Night&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Canteen&quot;, &quot;They Were Sisters&quot;, &quot;The Princess and the Pirate&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Susan&quot;, &quot;National Velvet&quot;, &quot;Mrs Skefflington&quot;, &quot;I Live in Grosvenor Square&quot;, &quot;Nob Hill&quot;, &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;, &quot;Valley of Decision&quot;, &quot;Conflict&quot; and &quot;Duffy&#x27;s Tavern&quot;. British &quot;runners up&quot; were &quot;They Were Sisters&quot;, &quot;I Live in Grosvenor Square&quot;, &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;, &quot;Madonna of the Seven Moons&quot;, &quot;Waterloo Road&quot;, &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot;, &quot;The Way to the Stars&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Sweetheart&quot;, &quot;Dead of Night&quot;, &quot;Waltz Time&quot; and &quot;Henry V&quot;.

Previous efforts to put Shakespeare on the screen included Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford&#x27;s 1929 &quot;The Taming of the Shrew;&quot; Max Reinhardt&#x27;s 1935 &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; for Warner Bros; a British film adaptation of &quot;As You Like It&quot; starring Olivier and Elisabeth Bergner and scored by William Walton; and MGM&#x27;s 1936 &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, directed by George Cukor and starring Norma Shearer and Leslie Howard. They had all misfired. According to TCM.com &quot;After screening &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1936), Olivier realized that the standard Hollywood camera style, which included moving in for a close-up at climactic moments, didn&#x27;t work for Shakespeare. In one scene, the close up had forced Norma Shearer to whisper one of her most passionate lines. Instead, he decided to film long speeches starting in close up and then moving the camera back as the actor&#x27;s intensity grew. He also decided to treat the soliloquies not as direct addresses to the audience, but as interior monologues&quot;.

The film earned over $1 million in rentals in the US. However, due to its high production cost and Entertainment Tax it did not go into profit for Rank until 1949. It earned United Artists a profit of $1.62 million. In 2007, &quot;Military History&quot; magazine listed this production 75th among &quot;The 100 Greatest War Movies&quot;.

<text>Euric (Gothic: 𐌰𐌹𐍅𐌰𐍂𐌴𐌹𐌺𐍃, &quot;Aiwareiks&quot;, see &quot;Eric&quot;), also known as Evaric ( 420 – 28 December 484), son of Theodoric I, ruled as king (&quot;rex&quot;) of the Visigoths, after murdering his brother, Theodoric II, from 466 until his death in 484. Sometimes he is called Euric II.

==Reign==
With his capital at Toulouse, Euric inherited a large portion of the Visigothic possessions in the Aquitaine region of Gaul, an area that had been under Visigothic control since 415. Over the decades the Visigoths had gradually expanded their holdings at the expense of the weak Roman government, including Euric&#x27;s sieges of Clermont in 475 and 476, as well as advancing well into Hispania in the process.

Upon becoming king, Euric defeated several other Visigothic kings and chieftains in a series of civil wars and soon became the first ruler of a truly unified Visigothic nation. Taking advantage of the Romans&#x27; problems, he extended Visigothic power in Hispania, driving the Suevi into the northwest of Iberia. By the time the Western Roman Empire ended in 476 he controlled nearly the entire Iberian Peninsula.

In 469 or 470 Euric defeated the British king Riothamus at Déols and expanded his kingdom even further north, possibly as far as the Loire River, the march of Syagrius territory. During what has become known as the Battle of Arles (471), near Arelate, presently Arles, Euric defeated a Roman army, killing three Roman counts and Anthemiolus, son of the Roman emperor Anthemius.

Previous Visigothic kings had officially ruled only as legates of the Roman emperor but Euric was the first to declare his complete independence from the puppet emperors. In 475 he forced the Western Emperor Julius Nepos to recognize his full independence instead of the status of foederati in exchange for the return of the Provence region of Gaul. The Roman citizens of Hispania then pledged their allegiance to Euric, recognizing him as their king. In the same year Clermont(-Ferrand) surrendered to him after a long siege, and its bishop, Sidonius Apollinaris, sued for peace.

Euric was one of the more learned of the great Visigothic kings and was the first one to formally codify his people&#x27;s laws. The &quot;Code of Euric&quot; probably issued around 476 codified the traditional laws that had been entrusted to the memory of designated specialists who had learned each article by heart. He employed many Gallo-Roman nobles in his court such as Leo of Narbonne.

At Euric&#x27;s death of natural causes in 484 the Kingdom of the Visigoths encompassed a third of modern France and almost all of Iberia (i.e. except the region of Galicia then expanding until the Douro river basin in present-day Portugal and by then ruled by the Suebi).

<text>The Razor&#x27;s Edge is a 1944 novel by W. Somerset Maugham. It tells the story of Larry Darrell, an American pilot traumatized by his experiences in World War I, who sets off in search of some transcendent meaning in his life. Maugham is the narrator whose narration takes the form of relating his conversations and reactions to the characters. He finds Larry both mystifying and compelling. The story begins through the eyes of Larry&#x27;s friends and acquaintances as they witness his personality change after the war. His rejection of conventional life and search for meaningful experience allows him to thrive while the more materialistic characters suffer reversals of fortune.

The novel&#x27;s title comes from a translation of a verse in the &quot;Katha Upanishad&quot;, paraphrased in the book&#x27;s epigraph as: &quot;The sharp edge of a razor is difficult to pass over; thus the wise say the path to Salvation is hard.&quot;

The book has twice been adapted into film;
first in 1946 starring Tyrone Power and Gene Tierney, with Herbert Marshall as Maugham and Anne Baxter as Sophie, and then a 1984 adaptation starring Bill Murray.

== Plot ==
Wounded and traumatised by the death of a comrade in the War, Larry Darrell returns to Chicago and his fiancée Isabel Bradley, only to announce that he does not plan to seek paid employment and instead will &quot;loaf&quot; on his small inheritance. He wants to delay their marriage and refuses to take up a job as a stockbroker offered to him by Henry Maturin, the father of his friend Gray. Meanwhile, Sophie, Larry&#x27;s childhood friend, settles into a happy marriage, only to later tragically lose her husband and baby in a car accident.

Larry moves to Paris and immerses himself in study and bohemian life. After two years of this &quot;loafing&quot;, Isabel visits and Larry asks her to join his life of wandering and searching, living in Paris and traveling with little money. She cannot accept his vision of life and breaks their engagement to go back to Chicago. There she marries the millionaire Gray, who provides her a rich family life. Meanwhile, Larry begins a sojourn through Europe, taking a job at a coal mine in Lens, France, where he befriends a former Polish army officer named Kosti. Kosti&#x27;s influence encourages Larry to look toward things spiritual for his answers rather than in books. Larry and Kosti leave the coal mine and travel together for a time before parting ways. Larry then meets a Benedictine monk named Father Ensheim in Bonn, Germany, while Father Ensheim is on leave from his monastery doing academic research. After spending months with the Benedictines and being unable to reconcile their conception of God with his own, Larry takes a job on an ocean liner and finds himself in Bombay.

Larry has spiritual adventures in India and comes back to Paris. What he actually found in India and what he finally concluded are held back from the reader for a considerable time until, in a scene late in the book, Maugham discusses India and spirituality with Larry in a café long into the evening. He starts off the chapter by saying &quot;I feel it right to warn the reader that he can very well skip this chapter without losing the thread of the story as I have to tell, since for most part it is nothing more than the account of a conversation that I had with Larry. However, I should add that except for this conversation, I would perhaps not have thought it worthwhile to write this book.&quot; Maugham then initiates the reader to Advaita philosophy and reveals how, through deep meditation and contact with Bhagawan Ramana Maharshi, disguised as Sri Ganesha in the novel, Larry goes on to realise God through the experience of samadhi—thus becoming a saint—and in the process gains liberation from the cycle of human suffering, birth, and death that the rest of the earthly mortals are subject to.

The 1929 stock market crash has ruined Gray, and he and Isabel are invited to live in her uncle Elliott Templeton&#x27;s grand Parisian house. Gray is often incapacitated with agonising migraines due to a general nervous collapse. Larry is able to help him using an Indian form of hypnotic suggestion. Sophie has also drifted to the French capital, where her friends find her reduced to alcohol, opium, and promiscuity – empty and dangerous liaisons that seem to help her to bury her pain. Larry first sets out to save her and then decides to marry her, a plan which displeases Isabel, who is still in love with him.

Isabel tempts Sophie back into alcoholism with a bottle of zubrovka and she disappears from Paris. Maugham deduces this after seeing Sophie in Toulon, where she has returned to smoking opium and promiscuity. He is drawn back into the tale when police interrogate him after Sophie has been found murdered with an inscribed book from him in her room, along with volumes by Baudelaire and Rimbaud.

Meanwhile, in Antibes, Elliott Templeton is on his deathbed. Despite the fact that he has throughout his life compulsively sought out aristocratic society, none of his titled friends come to see him, which makes him alternately morose and irate. But his outlook on death is somewhat positive: &quot;I have always moved in the best society in Europe, and I have no doubt that I shall move in the best society in heaven.&quot;

Isabel inherits his fortune, but genuinely grieves for her uncle. Maugham confronts her about Sophie, having figured out Isabel&#x27;s role in Sophie&#x27;s downfall. Isabel&#x27;s only punishment will be that she will never get Larry, who has decided to return to the United States of America and live as a common working man. He is uninterested in the rich and glamorous world that Isabel will move in. Maugham ends his narrative by suggesting that all the characters got what they wanted in the end: &quot;Elliott social eminence; Isabel an assured position...Sophie death; and Larry happiness.&quot;

== Influences and critical reception ==

Maugham, like Hermann Hesse, anticipated a fresh embrace of Eastern culture by Americans and Europeans almost a decade before the Beats were to popularise it. (Americans had explored Eastern philosophy before these authors, in the nineteenth century through the Transcendentalists, Theosophists, the visit of Vivekananda in 1893, and then Yogananda&#x27;s move to the US in 1920.) Maugham visited Sri Ramana Ashram, where he had a direct interaction with Ramana Maharshi in Tamil Nadu, India in 1938. Maugham&#x27;s suggestion that he &quot;invented nothing&quot; was a source of annoyance for Christopher Isherwood, who helped him translate the verse (1.3.14) from the Katha Upanishad for the novel&#x27;s epigraph – उत्तिष्ठ जाग्रत प्राप्य वरान्निबोधत| क्षुरस्य धारा निशिता दुरत्यया दुर्गं पथस्तत्कवयो वदन्ति|| (uttiṣṭha jāgrata prāpya varān nibodhata| kṣurasya dhārā niśitā duratyayā durga pathas tat kavayo vadanti|| ) – which means &quot;Rise, wake up, seek the wise and realize. The path is difficult to cross like the sharpened edge of the razor (knife), so say the wise.&quot;

Many thought Isherwood, who had built his own literary reputation by then and was studying Indian philosophy, was the basis for the book&#x27;s hero. Isherwood went so far as to write to &quot;Time&quot; denying this speculation. It has been suggested that Guy Hague was an important influence in the character of Darrell, although it now appears that he was not at Ramanasramam when Maugham visited. The English poet and translator Lewis Thompson is thought to be a more likely candidate. David Haberman has pointed out that Ronald Nixon, an Englishman who took monastic vows and became known as Krishna Prem, served as a fighter pilot in the First World War and experienced a crisis of meaninglessness that was &quot;strikingly similar&quot; to that experienced by Larry.

Another distinct possibility for influence is raised by the anglicised American, British MP Chips Channon in his diaries. During a trip to New York in August 1944, Channon wrote &quot;I saw much of Somerset Maugham, who never before was a friend. He has put me into a book, &#x27;the Razor&#x27;s Edge&#x27; and when I dined with him, I asked him why he had done it, and he explained, with some embarrassment, that he had split me into three characters, and then written a book about all three. So I am Elliott Templeton, Larry, himself the hero of the book, and another: however I am flattered, and the book is a masterpiece ...&quot;.

<text>In Greek mythology, Eiresione or Iresione (Greek: Εἰρεσιώνη, from εἶρος - &quot;eiros&quot;, &quot;wool&quot;) was the personification of an object very important in many Greek rituals and ceremonies: a branch of olive or laurel, covered with wool, fruits, cakes and olive flasks, dedicated to Apollo and carried about by singing boys during the festivals of Pyanopsia and Thargelia, and afterwards hung up at the house door. It could only be carried by children who had two living parents. The song they were singing during the ritual was also known as &quot;eiresione&quot;:
Greek:

Eiresione signified the advent of wealth (Greek: πλοῦτος - &quot;ploutos&quot;).

<doc id="80499" wikidata="Q1217612" url="?curid=80499" title="The Yearling (1946 film)">
<text>The Yearling is a 1946 American Family Western film directed by Clarence Brown, produced by Sidney Franklin, and released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). The screenplay by Paul Osborn and John Lee Mahin (uncredited) was adapted from Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings&#x27;s 1938 novel of the same name. The film stars: Gregory Peck, Jane Wyman, Claude Jarman Jr., Chill Wills and Forrest Tucker.

The story follows a boy named Jody, who adopts a trouble-making young deer. The story was later adapted as the 1994 TV film &quot;The Yearling&quot; starring Peter Strauss and Jean Smart.

==Plot==
Ezra &quot;Penny&quot; Baxter, once a Confederate soldier, and his wife Ora, are pioneer farmers near Lake George, Florida in 1878. Their son, Jody, a boy in his pre-teen years, is their only surviving child. Jody has a wonderful relationship with his warm and loving father. Ora, however, is still haunted by the deaths of the other children of the family she lost over the years, fearing that Jody will end up dying if she shows any love to the boy, leading Jody to find her unloving and unreasonable.

One morning, Jody and his parents discover that a bear has appeared and killed a calf and young pig from among their stock. They set out after the bear, accompanied by Penny&#x27;s dogs Perk, Rip and Julia. They catch up with the bear, but it is able to escape after Perk flees, Penny&#x27;s gun misfires, and Julia is badly injured.

Upset over Julia&#x27;s injury and the broken gun, Penny decides to get a new shotgun in exchange for Perk.

One day, as Penny and Jody are tracking down their missing hogs that had been stolen by the Forresters, a rattlesnake bites Penny before he kills it. Penny kills a doe and uses her liver to draw out the venom. Jody asks to adopt the doe&#x27;s orphaned fawn. Penny permits it but warns Jody that the fawn will have to be set free when it grows up.

When Jody goes to ask his friend Fodderwing, the youngest Forrester son, to name the fawn he discovers that Fodderwing has died. However, Buck Forrester tells Jody that Fodderwing had said that if he had a fawn he would name him Flag. Jody and his family attend Fodderwing&#x27;s funeral, and at a generous request from the Forresters, Penny offers a eulogy about Fodderwing&#x27;s kindness and wisdom with animals.

As months pass, Jody and Flag become inseparable. One year later, Flag has grown up and become a nuisance to the household and farm; causing damage to the farm and crops. After Penny is injured while trying to clear another field to make up for lost crops, Penny tells Jody that he and his mother have agreed that for Jody to keep Flag, he must replant lost corn, and build a taller fence around the cornfield.

Jody works hard and even receives help from Ora with the fence, but during the night, Flag manages to jump the new fence and destroy the new corn. Penny orders Jody to take the deer out into the woods and shoot it. Jody takes Flag out but does not have the heart to kill it. He orders the deer to go away and never return, but Flag comes back to their property, and again devours the corn crop. Ora shoots Flag with a double-barreled shotgun, discharging one of the barrels, but only wounding the deer. Penny orders Jody to put the deer out of its &quot;torment&quot;. Rather than let his pet deer suffer an agonizing death, he follows his father&#x27;s orders and kills Flag with the remaining shell.

The loss of Jody&#x27;s beloved pet deer proves too much for him to handle. Overwhelmed with anger and despair, Jody runs away from home. Three days later, he is unconscious and adrift on the river in a canoe when he is rescued by a friendly boat captain, who returns him home. Jody and Penny quickly reconcile, but Ora is still out searching for him.

Just before Jody goes to bed, Ora returns and sees that he is back. She becomes filled with joy, knowing that her fear of losing her last child is now over. She happily runs into Jody&#x27;s room and showers him with more affection than she ever has before. She is no longer afraid to show her maternal love to him.
==Cast==
==Production==

&quot;The Yearling&quot; was filmed on location in the Juniper Prairie Wilderness in the Ocala National Forest in Florida. A hiking trail in the area, &quot;The Yearling Trail&quot;, is named after the story, and gives access to sites where the family lived whose stories inspired the novel.

MGM originally began production on &quot;The Yearling&quot; in 1941, with Spencer Tracy set to star as the patriarch, and with Victor Fleming chosen to direct. The studio also hired Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, the author of the novel &quot;The Yearling&quot;, as a consultant and location scout. Rawlings marked a forest service map with locations for filming, specifically referencing the clearing she named &quot;Baxter&#x27;s Island&quot;. MGM moved to the filming location, renovated the cabin, and built surrounding buildings to create a town for a set. Once the actors arrived on location, a combination of the bugs, heat, and lack of enthusiasm for the plot made the actors leave. This led to the film being shelved after only three weeks of location shooting in Florida.

Production was resumed in 1945, after Clarence Brown was hired as the new director. Brown cast Gregory Peck to play Pa, Jane Wyman to play Ma, and after a long search, cast Claude Jarman Jr. to play Jody. Due to Brown&#x27;s drive for perfection, the average take number for scenes was between 20–21. He also got real hunting dogs to film the bear fight scene after deciding the original city dogs were not good enough. Peck received the second of his five Oscar nominations for &quot;The Yearling&quot;, his fifth film.

==Music==
Herbert Stothart made arrangements of Frederick Delius&#x27;s music, particularly &quot;Appalachia: Variations on an Old Slave Song&quot;, for the film. In 2006 Film Score Monthly released the majority of the film&#x27;s original score alongside Stothart&#x27;s score for &quot;Random Harvest&quot; (1942) in the CD collection &quot;Random Harvest/The Yearling (1942/1946)&quot; limited to 3,000 copies. Liner notes for both scores were provided by Marilee Bradford.

==Reception==
Jac. D. Grant of the &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote, it provides &quot;an emotional experience seldom equaled.&quot; It&#x27;s been described as &quot;a huge success&quot; and &quot;a remarkable film that truly is for the entire family&quot; by &quot;TV Guide&quot;; &quot;Variety&quot; said it is a &quot;heart-warming story&quot;, that its &quot;underlying power is impressive,&quot; and that &quot;the underplaying is sometimes too static, but just as interest lags, the director injects another highlight.&quot;

The film earned $4,768,000, in the US and Canada and $2,831,000 elsewhere, making it MGM&#x27;s most successful movie of the year. However, because of its high production cost, profits were only $451,000. Since the release of &quot;The Yearling,&quot; films with similar themes have been released including &quot;Old Yeller&quot; and &quot;Kes&quot;.

==Awards and nominations==

<text>Doughty Hanson &amp; Co. is a British private equity fund manager focused on leveraged buyout and recapitalization transactions primarily of upper middle-market companies in Europe. The firm also invests opportunistically in European real estate and provides early-stage venture capital to technology companies.

The firm which was founded in 1985 by Nigel Doughty, Chris Wallis and Richard Hanson is one of the oldest European buyout private equity firms. Since its inception, the firm has invested over €23 billion across more than 100 investments.

On 4 February 2012, Doughty was found dead in the gymnasium of his Lincolnshire home.
Then, on 10 August 2015, the firm announced the shutdown of most of its European offices after abandoning its next round of funding. The offices closed in 2015 included Paris, Frankfurt, Madrid and Stockholm. In May 2017, the firm re-branded itself to DH Private Equity Partners.

==History==
Doughty Hanson traces its history back to 1985 when Nigel Doughty and Richard (Dick) Hanson started working together on European buyout investments within Standard Chartered Bank as founding members of its management buyout unit. In 1990 they established CWB Partners, a joint private equity venture between Standard Chartered and Westdeutsche Landesbank.

Doughty Hanson was established as an independent firm in 1995. In 1999, the group expanded its activities with the formation of a real estate investment team and the following year it established a team to focus on early-stage technology venture capital investing.

==Investment strategy==
Doughty Hanson&#x27;s three product areas operate as separate fund families:

* Private Equity – Doughty Hanson&#x27;s buyout team focuses on majority ownership and control of market-leading businesses at the upper end of the European middle-market with enterprise values between €250m and €1bn.
* Real Estate – Doughty Hanson is an opportunistic investor and developer active in the office, retail and logistics sectors. Investments range from the acquisition of existing single assets and portfolios to more complex developments and urban regeneration projects.
* Technology Ventures – The Doughty Hanson Technology Ventures team targets technology companies within three industry sectors: internet software, mobile communications and clean energy technology.

===Responsible Investing===
In June 2007 Doughty Hanson became one of the first private equity signatories to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UNPRI), which provide a framework for incorporating environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues into investment decision-making and ownership practices. A year later the firm became the first private equity manager in Europe to hire a dedicated Head of Sustainability to focus on the implementation, management and monitoring of ESG issues across the Doughty Hanson portfolio.

==Investment funds==
Since inception, Doughty Hanson has raised over €8 billion across its five private equity funds.

The following is a summary of the investment funds raised to date by Doughty Hanson:
In 2007, Doughty completed fundraising for its fifth private equity fund with €3.0 billion of investor commitments. This came just two years after the firm had wrapped up a difficult fundraising for Doughty Hanson IV, in 2004 which had only generated €1.6 billion of investor commitments compared with the firm&#x27;s original €3.0 billion target. Doughty Hanson III, raised in 1997 had been a €2.7 billion investment fund.

==Portfolio companies==
The following investments are representative of Doughty Hanson&#x27;s portfolio of private companies:

* The RHM Group - RHM was among the leading food manufacturing groups in the UK. Founded in 1899, RHM was acquired by Doughty Hanson in 2000 and listed on the London Stock Exchange in July 2005.
*Priory Healthcare is the largest independent provider of mental health and rehabilitation services in the UK. Priory was acquired by Doughty Hanson in 2002 and was sold in July 2005 in a transaction valued at £875m.
* Saft Groupe S.A. - Saft is a manufacturer of high-end batteries for a wide range of niche applications, including aviation, railway, industrial stand-by, defence, and emergency lighting. Saft was acquired by Doughty Hanson in 2004 and the company was listed on Euronext, Paris, in June 2005.
* Moeller - Moeller is one of the largest globally active manufacturers of low-voltage electrical distribution and automation components for industrial, commercial, and residential applications. Moeller was acquired by Doughty Hanson in 2005 and sold in April 2008 in a transaction valued at €1.65 billion.

Other notable investments include: TMF Group, TV3 (Ireland), Tumi Inc., Dunlop Standard Aerospace Group, Caudwell Group, and LM Wind Power.

==Notable alumni==
*James Max - journalist and radio presenter specialising in business issues and was a semifinalist on the first series of the British version of &quot;The Apprentice&quot; television programme.
*Mark Florman - founder and former CEO of Maizels, Westerberg &amp; Co.

<text>A decimal separator is a symbol that separates the integer part from the fractional part of a number written in decimal form. Different countries officially designate different symbols for use as the separator. The choice of symbol can also affect the choice of symbol for the thousands separator used in digit grouping.

Any such symbol can be called a decimal mark, decimal marker, or decimal sign. Symbol-specific names are also used; decimal point and decimal comma refer to a dot (either baseline or middle) and comma respectively, when it is used as a decimal separator; these are the usual terms used in English, with the aforementioned generic terms reserved for abstract usage.

In many contexts, when a number is spoken, the function of the separator is assumed by the spoken name of the symbol: &quot;comma&quot; or &quot;point&quot; in most cases. In some specialized contexts, the word &quot;decimal&quot; is instead used for this purpose (such as in International Civil Aviation Organization-regulated air traffic control communications). In mathematics, the decimal separator is a type of radix point, a term that also applies to number systems with bases other than ten.

==History==
===Hellenistic–Renaissance eras===

In the Middle Ages, before printing, a bar ( ¯ ) over the units digit was used to separate the integral part of a number from its fractional part, as in 995 (meaning 99.95 in decimal point format). A similar notation remains in common use as an underbar to superscript digits, especially for monetary values without a decimal separator, as in 99. Later, a &quot;separatrix&quot; (i.e., a short, roughly vertical ink stroke) between the units and tenths position became the norm among Arab mathematicians (e.g. 99ˌ95), while an L-shaped or vertical bar (|) served as the separatrix in England. When this character was typeset, it was convenient to use the existing comma (99,95) or full stop (99.95) instead.

Positional decimal fractions appear for the first time in a book by the Arab mathematician Abu&#x27;l-Hasan al-Uqlidisi written in the 10th century. The practice is ultimately derived from the decimal Hindu–Arabic numeral system used in Indian mathematics, and popularized by the Persian mathematician Al-Khwarizmi, when Latin translation of his work on the Indian numerals introduced the decimal positional number system to the Western world. His &quot;Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing&quot; presented the first systematic solution of linear and quadratic equations in Arabic.

Gerbert of Aurillac marked triples of columns with an arc (called a &quot;Pythagorean arc&quot;), when using his Hindu–Arabic numeral-based abacus in the 10th century. Fibonacci followed this convention when writing numbers, such as in his influential work in the 13th century. 

The earliest known record of using the decimal point is in the astronomical tables compiled by the Italian merchant and mathematician Giovanni Bianchini in the 1440s.

Tables of logarithms prepared by John Napier in 1614 and 1619 used the period (full stop) as the decimal separator, which was then adopted by Henry Briggs in his influential 17th century work.

In France, the full stop was already in use in printing to make Roman numerals more readable, so the comma was chosen.

Many other countries, such as Italy, also chose to use the comma to mark the decimal units position. It has been made standard by the ISO for international blueprints. However, English-speaking countries took the comma to separate sequences of three digits. In some countries, a raised dot or dash (&quot;&quot;) may be used for grouping or decimal separator; this is particularly common in handwriting.

===English-speaking countries===
In the United States, the full stop or period (.) is used as the standard decimal separator.
In the nations of the British Empire (and, later, the Commonwealth of Nations), the full stop could be used in typewritten material and its use was not banned, although the interpunct (a.k.a. decimal point, point or mid dot) was preferred as a decimal separator, in printing technologies that could accommodate it, e.g. However, as the mid dot was already in common use in the mathematics world to indicate multiplication, the SI rejected its use as the decimal separator.

During the beginning of British metrication in the late 1960s and with impending currency decimalisation, there was some debate in the United Kingdom as to whether the decimal comma or decimal point should be preferred: the British Standards Institution and some sectors of industry advocated the comma and the Decimal Currency Board advocated for the point. In the event, the point was chosen by the Ministry of Technology in 1968.
When South Africa adopted the metric system, it adopted the comma as its decimal separator, although a number of house styles, including some English-language newspapers such as &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, continue to use the full stop.

Previously, signs along California roads expressed distances in decimal numbers with the decimal part in superscript, as in 37, meaning 3.7. Though California has since transitioned to mixed numbers with common fractions, the older style remains on postmile markers and bridge inventory markers.

===Constructed languages===
The three most spoken international auxiliary languages, Ido, Esperanto, and Interlingua, all use the comma as the decimal separator.

Interlingua has used the comma as its decimal separator since the publication of the in 1951.

Esperanto also uses the comma as its official decimal separator, whilst thousands are usually separated by non-breaking spaces (e.g. ). It is possible to separate thousands by a full stop (e.g. ), though this is not as common.

Ido&#x27;s &quot;Kompleta Gramatiko Detaloza di la Linguo Internaciona Ido&quot; (Complete Detailed Grammar of the International Language Ido) officially states that commas are used for the decimal separator whilst full stops are used to separate thousands, millions, etc. So the number 12,345,678.90123 (in American notation), for instance, would be written &quot;12.345.678,90123&quot; in Ido.

The 1931 grammar of Volapük uses the comma as its decimal separator but, somewhat unusually, the middle dot as its thousands separator (12·345·678,90123).

In 1958, disputes between European and American delegates over the correct representation of the decimal separator nearly stalled the development of the ALGOL computer programming language. ALGOL ended up allowing different decimal separators, but most computer languages and standard data formats (e.g., C, Java, Fortran, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)) specify a dot. C++ and a couple of others permit a quote (&#x27;) as thousands separator, and many others like Python and Julia, (only) allow ‘_’ as such a separator (it&#x27;s usually ignored, i.e. also allows 1_00_00_000 aligning with the Indian number style of 1,00,00,000 that would be 10,000,000 in the US).

=== Radix point ===
In mathematics and computing, a radix point or radix character is a symbol used in the display of numbers to separate the integer part of the value from its fractional part. In English and many other languages (including many that are written right-to-left), the integer part is at the left of the radix point, and the fraction part at the right of it.

A radix point is most often used in decimal (base 10) notation, when it is more commonly called the decimal point (the prefix implying base 10). In English-speaking countries, the decimal point is usually a small dot (.) placed either on the baseline, or halfway between the baseline and the top of the digits (·)
In many other countries, the radix point is a comma (,) placed on the baseline.

These conventions are generally used both in machine displays (printing, computer monitors) and in handwriting. It is important to know which notation is being used when working in different software programs. The respective ISO standard defines both the comma and the small dot as decimal markers, but does not explicitly define universal radix marks for bases other than 10.

Fractional numbers are rarely displayed in other number bases, but, when they are, a radix character may be used for the same purpose. When used with the binary (base 2) representation, it may be called &quot;binary point&quot;.

==Current standards==
The 22nd General Conference on Weights and Measures declared in 2003, “The symbol for the decimal marker shall be either the point on the line or the comma on the line.” It further reaffirmed,
: “Numbers may be divided in groups of three in order to facilitate reading; neither dots nor commas are ever inserted in the spaces between groups”
( for example). This use has therefore been recommended by technical organizations, such as the United States’ National Institute of Standards and Technology.

Past versions of ISO 8601, but not the 2019 revision, also stipulated normative notation based on SI conventions, adding that the comma is preferred over the full stop.

ISO 80000-1 stipulates, “The decimal sign is either a comma or a point on the line.” The standard does not stipulate any preference, observing that usage will depend on customary usage in the language concerned, but adds a note that as per ISO/IEC directives, all ISO standards should use the comma as the decimal marker.

==Digit grouping==
For ease of reading, numbers with many digits (e.g. numbers over 999) may be divided into groups using a delimiter, such as comma &quot;,&quot; or dot &quot;.&quot;, half-space (or thin space) space , underscore &quot;_&quot; (as in maritime &quot;21_450&quot;) or apostrophe «&#x27;». In some countries, these &quot;digit group separators&quot; are only employed to the left of the decimal separator; in others, they are also used to separate numbers with a long fractional part. An important reason for grouping is that it allows rapid judgement of the number of digits, via telling at a glance (&quot;subitizing&quot;) rather than counting (contrast, for example, with 100000000 for one hundred million).

The use of thin spaces as separators, not dots or commas (for example: and for &quot;twenty thousand&quot; and &quot;one million&quot;), has been official policy of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures since 1948 (and reaffirmed in 2003) stating
: &quot;neither dots nor commas are ever inserted in the spaces between groups&quot;,

as well as of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the American Medical Association&#x27;s widely followed &quot;AMA Manual of Style&quot;, and the UK Metrication Board, among others.

The groups created by the delimiters tend to follow the usages of local languages, which vary. In European languages, large numbers are read in groups of thousands, and the delimiterwhich occurs every three digits when it is usedmay be called a &quot;thousands separator&quot;. In East Asian cultures, particularly China, Japan, and Korea, large numbers are read in groups of myriads (10 000s) but the delimiter commonly separates every three digits.

The Indian numbering system is somewhat more complex: It groups the rightmost three digits altogether (until the hundreds place) and thereafter groups by sets of two digits. For example, one trillion (on the short scale; a million millions) would thus be written as 10,00,00,00,00,000 or 10 kharab.

The convention for digit group separators historically varied among countries, but usually sought to distinguish the delimiter from the decimal separator. Traditionally, English-speaking countries (except South Africa) employed commas as the delimiter – 10,000 – and other European countries employed periods or spaces: 10.000 or . Because of the confusion that could result in international documents, in recent years the use of spaces as separators has been advocated by the superseded SI/ISO 31-0 standard, as well as by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures and the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, which have also begun advocating the use of a &quot;thin space&quot; in &quot;groups of three&quot;.

Within the United States, the American Medical Association&#x27;s widely followed &quot;AMA Manual of Style&quot; also calls for a thin space. In programming languages and online encoding environments (for example, ASCII-only) a thin space is not practical or available, in which case an underscore, regular word space, or no delimiter are the alternatives.

===Data vis-à-vis mask===
Digit group separators can occur either as part of the data or as a mask through which the data is displayed. This is an example of the separation of presentation and content, making it possible to display numbers with spaced digit grouping in a way that does not insert any whitespace characters into the string of digits in the content. In many computing contexts, it is preferred to omit digit group separators from the data and instead overlay them as a mask (an input mask or an output mask).

Common examples include spreadsheets and databases in which currency values are entered without such marks but are displayed with them inserted. (Similarly, phone numbers can have hyphens, spaces or parentheses as a mask rather than as data.) In web content, such digit grouping can be done with CSS style. It is useful because the number can be copied and pasted into calculators (including a web browser&#x27;s omnibox) and parsed by the computer as-is (i.e., without the user manually purging the extraneous characters). For example, Wikipedia content can display numbers this way, as in the following examples:
:: metres is 1 astronomical unit
:: is  rounded to 20 decimal places
:: is rounded to 20 decimal places.

In some programming languages, it is possible to group the digits in the program&#x27;s source code to make it easier to read; see Integer literal: Digit separators.

: Ada
: C# 
: D
: Go 
: Haskell 
: Java
: JavaScript 
: Kotlin
: OCaml
: Perl
: Python 
: PHP 
: Ruby
: Rust
: Zig
Java, JavaScript, Swift, Julia, and free-form Fortran 90 use the underscore (_) character for this purpose; as such, these languages allow seven hundred million to be entered as 700_000_000.

Fixed-form Fortran ignores whitespace (in all contexts), so 700 000 000 has always been accepted. Fortran 90 and its successors allow (ignored) underscores in numbers in free-form.

C++14, Rebol, and Red all allow the use of an apostrophe for digit grouping, so 700&#x27;000&#x27;000 is permissible.

Below is shown an example of Kotlin code using separators to increase readability:

val exampleNumber = 12_004_953 // Twelve million four thousand nine hundred fifty-three
===Exceptions to digit grouping===
The International Bureau of Weights and Measures states that &quot;when there are only four digits before or after the decimal marker, it is customary not to use a space to isolate a single digit&quot;. Likewise, some manuals of style state that thousands separators should not be used in normal text for numbers from to inclusive where no decimal fractional part is shown (in other words, for four-digit whole numbers), whereas others use thousands separators and others use both. For example, APA style stipulates a thousands separator for &quot;most figures of or more&quot; except for page numbers, binary digits, temperatures, etc.

There are always &quot;common-sense&quot; country-specific exceptions to digit grouping, such as year numbers, postal codes, and ID numbers of predefined nongrouped format, which style guides usually point out.

===In non-base-10 numbering systems===
In binary (base-2), a full space can be used between groups of four digits, corresponding to a nibble, or equivalently to a hexadecimal digit. For integer numbers, dots are used as well to separate groups of four bits.
Alternatively, binary digits may be grouped by threes, corresponding to an octal digit. Similarly, in hexadecimal (base-16), full spaces are usually used to group digits into twos, making each group correspond to a byte. Additionally, groups of eight bytes are often separated by a hyphen.

==Influence of calculators and computers==
In countries with a decimal comma, the decimal point is also common as the &quot;international&quot; notation because of the influence of devices, such as electronic calculators, which use the decimal point. Most computer operating systems allow selection of the decimal separator; programs that have been carefully internationalized will follow this, but some programs ignore it and a few may even fail to operate if the setting has been changed.

Computer interfaces may be set to the Unicode international &quot;Common locale&quot; using as defined at Details of the current (2020) definitions may be found at 

==Conventions worldwide==

====Countries using decimal comma====
Countries where a comma &quot;,&quot; is used as decimal separator include:

====Countries using decimal point====
Countries where a dot &quot;.&quot; is used as decimal separator include:

Notes:

===Other numeral systems===
Unicode defines a &quot;decimal separator key symbol&quot; (⎖ in hex U+2396, decimal 9110) which looks similar to the apostrophe. This symbol is from ISO/IEC 9995 and is intended for use on a keyboard to indicate a key that performs decimal separation.

In the Arab world, where Eastern Arabic numerals are used for writing numbers, a different character is used to separate the integer and fractional parts of numbers. It is referred to as an Arabic decimal separator (U+066B, rendered: ) in Unicode. An Arabic thousands separator (U+066C, rendered: ) also exists. Example: (9,999.99)

In Persian, the decimal separator is called momayyez. The Unicode Consortium&#x27;s investigation concluded that &quot;computer programs should render U+066B as a shortened, lowered, and possibly more slanted slash (); this should be distinguishable from the slash at the first sight.&quot; To separate sequences of three digits, an Arabic thousands separator (rendered as: ), a Latin comma, or a blank space may be used; however this is not a standard. Example: (9,999.99)

In English Braille, the decimal point, , is distinct from both the comma, , and the full stop, .

==Examples of use==
The following examples show the decimal separator and the thousands separator in various countries that use the Arabic numeral system.

*In Belgium (Dutch), Brazil, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Indonesia, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovenia, Sweden and much of Europe: or 1.234.567,89. In handwriting, 1˙234˙567,89 is also seen, but never in Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovenia or Sweden. In Italy, a straight apostrophe is also used in handwriting: 1&#x27;234&#x27;567,89. In the Netherlands and Dutch-speaking Belgium, the points thousands separator is used, and is preferred for currency amounts, but the space is recommended by some style guides, mostly in technical writing.
*In Estonia, currency numbers often use a dot &quot;.&quot; as the decimal separator, and a space as a thousands separator. This is most visible on shopping receipts and in documents that also use other numbers with decimals, such as measurements. This practice is used to better distinguish between prices and other values with decimals. An older convention uses dots to separate thousands (with commas for decimals) — this older practice makes it easier to avoid word breaks with larger numbers.
*Historically, in Germany and Austria, thousands separators were occasionally denoted by alternating uses of comma and point, e.g. 1.234,567.890,12 for &quot;eine Milliarde 234 Millionen ...&quot;, but this is never seen in modern days and requires explanation to a contemporary German reader.
*Switzerland: There are two cases: An apostrophe as a thousands separator along with a dot &quot;.&quot; as the decimal separator are used for currency values (for example: 1&#x27;234&#x27;567.89). For other values, the SI-style is used with a comma &quot;,&quot; as the decimal separator. The apostrophe is also the most common variety for non-currency values: 1&#x27;234&#x27;567,89 —.
*In Ireland, Israel, Japan, Korea (both), Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States: 1,234,567.89 or 1,234,567·89; the latter is generally found only in older, and especially handwritten documents. 
*English Canada: There are two cases: The preferred method for currency values is $10,000.00 —while for numeric values, it is ; however, commas are also sometimes used, although no longer taught in school or used in official publications.
*SI style: or (in their own publications, the dot &quot;.&quot; is used in the English version, and the comma &quot;,&quot; in the official French version).
*In China, comma and space are used to mark digit groups, because dot is used as decimal separator. There is no universal convention on digit grouping, so both thousands grouping and no digit grouping can be found. Japan and Taiwan are similar; although when grouping by myriads, kanji or characters are frequently used as separators: 1億2345万6789 / 1億2345萬6789. Commas are used when grouping by thousands.
*In India, due to a numeral system using &quot;lakhs&quot; (&quot;lacs&quot;) (1,23,456 equal to 123,456) and &quot;crores&quot; (1,23,45,678 equal to ), a comma is used at levels of thousand, lakh, and crore. For example, 10 million (1 crore) would be written as 1,00,00,000. In Pakistan, there is a greater tendency to use the standard western system, while using the Indian numbering system when conducting business in Urdu.
*In Sweden, the currency sometimes used the colon as decimal separator (1 234 567:89).

<text>Twisted pair cabling is a type of communications cable in which two conductors of a single circuit are twisted together for the purposes of improving electromagnetic compatibility. Compared to a single conductor or an untwisted balanced pair, a twisted pair reduces electromagnetic radiation from the pair and crosstalk between neighboring pairs and improves rejection of external electromagnetic interference. It was invented by Alexander Graham Bell.

For additional noise immunity, twisted-pair cabling may be shielded. Cable with shielding is known as shielded twisted pair (STP) and without as unshielded twisted pair (UTP).

==Explanation==
A twisted pair can be used as a balanced line, which as part of a balanced circuit can greatly reduce the effect of noise currents induced on the line by coupling of electric or magnetic fields. The idea is that the currents induced in each of the two wires are very nearly equal. The twisting ensures that the two wires are on average the same distance from the interfering source and are affected equally. The noise thus produces a common-mode signal which can be canceled at the receiver by detecting the difference signal only, the latter being the wanted signal.

Common-mode rejection starts to fail on untwisted wires when the noise source is close to the signal wires; the closer wire will couple with the noise more strongly and the receiver will be unable to eliminate it. This problem is especially apparent in telecommunication cables where pairs in the same cable lie next to each other for many miles. Twisting the pairs counters this effect as on each half twist the wire nearest to the noise source is exchanged. Provided the interfering source remains uniform, or nearly so, over the distance of a single twist, the induced noise will remain common mode.

The twist rate (also called &quot;pitch&quot; of the twist, usually defined in twists per meter) makes up part of the specification for a given type of cable. When nearby pairs have equal twist rates, the same conductors of the different pairs may repeatedly lie next to each other, partially undoing the benefits of twisting. For this reason, it is commonly specified that, at least for cables containing small numbers of pairs, the twist rates must differ.

In contrast to shielded or foiled twisted pair (typically S/FTP or F/UTP cable shielding), UTP cable is not surrounded by any shielding. UTP is the primary wire type for telephone usage and is very common for computer networking.

==History==
The earliest telephones used telegraph lines which were single-wire earth return circuits. In the 1880s electric trams were installed in many cities, which induced noise into these circuits. In some countries, the tram companies were held responsible for disruption to existing telegraph lines and had to pay for remedial work. For new installations, however, it was necessary to protect against existing trams from the outset. Interference on telephone lines is even more disruptive than it is on telegraph lines. Telephone companies converted to balanced circuits, which had the incidental benefit of reducing attenuation, hence increasing range.

As electrical power distribution became more commonplace, this measure proved inadequate. Two wires, strung on either side of cross bars on utility poles, shared the route with electrical power lines. Within a few years, the growing use of electricity again brought an increase of interference, so engineers devised a method called wire transposition, to cancel out the interference.

In wire transposition, the wires exchange position once every several poles. In this way, the two wires would receive similar EMI from power lines. This represented an early implementation of twisting, with a twist rate of about four twists per kilometer, or six per mile. Such open-wire balanced lines with periodic transpositions still survive today in some rural areas.

Twisted-pair cabling was invented by Alexander Graham Bell in 1881. By 1900, the entire American telephone network was either twisted pair or open wire with transposition to guard against interference. Today, most of the twisted pairs in the world are outdoor landlines, owned and maintained by telephone companies, used for voice service.

==Unshielded twisted pair==
Unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cables are found in many Ethernet networks and telephone systems. For indoor telephone applications, UTP is often grouped into sets of 25 pairs according to a standard 25-pair color code originally developed by AT&amp;T. A typical subset of these colors (white/blue, blue/white, white/orange, orange/white) shows up in most UTP cables. The cables are typically made with copper wires measured at 22 or 24 American Wire Gauge (AWG) (0.644 or 0.511 mm²), with the colored insulation typically made from an insulator such as polyethylene or FEP and the total package covered in a polyethylene jacket.

For urban outdoor telephone cables containing hundreds or thousands of pairs, the cable is divided into small but identical bundles. Each bundle consists of twisted pairs that have different twist rates, as pairs having the same twist rate within the cable can still experience some degree of crosstalk. The bundles are in turn twisted together to make up the cable.

UTP is also the most common cable used in computer networking. Modern Ethernet, the most common data networking standard, can use UTP cables, with increasing data rates requiring higher specification variants of the UTP cable. Twisted-pair cabling is often used in data networks for short and medium-length connections because of its relatively lower costs compared to optical fiber and coaxial cable.

As UTP cable bandwidth has improved to match the baseband of television signals, UTP is now used in some video applications, primarily in security cameras. As UTP is a balanced transmission line, a balun is needed to connect to unbalanced equipment, for example any using BNC connectors and designed for coaxial cable.

==Cable shielding==


Twisted pair cables may incorporate shielding in an attempt to prevent electromagnetic interference. Shielding provides an electrically conductive barrier to attenuate electromagnetic waves external to the shield. The shield also provides a conduction path by which induced currents can be circulated and returned to the source via a ground reference connection. Such shielding can be applied to individual pairs or to a collection of pairs. Shielding may be foil or braided wire.

When shielding is applied to a collection of pairs, it is usually referred to as screening, but usage among vendors and authors in applying such words as &quot;screening&quot;, &quot;shielding&quot;, and &quot;STP (shielded twisted pair)&quot; can be subject to variability.

ISO/IEC 11801:2002 (Annex E) attempts to internationally standardize the various shielding designations for twisted pair (TP) cables using an explicit two-part abbreviation in the form of &quot;x/xTP&quot;, where the first &quot;x&quot; indicates the shielding for the overall cable and the second &quot;x&quot; indicates the shielding for individual pairs or quads, where each &quot;x&quot; can be:

* U for unshielded,
* S for braided shielding (in outer layer only), and/or
* F for foil shielding.

Shielded Cat 5e, Cat 6/6A, and Cat 8/8.1 cables typically have F/UTP construction, while shielded Cat 7/7A and Cat 8.2 cables use S/FTP construction.

Because the shielding is conductive, it may also serve as a path to ground. A foil-shielded, twisted pair cable may have an integrally incorporated grounding wire called a &quot;drain wire&quot; which makes electrical contact with the shield. The purpose of the drain wire is for easy connection to terminals which are usually designed for connection of round wires.

Common shield construction types include:
*Individual shield (U/FTP): Individual shielding with aluminum foil for each twisted pair or quad. Common names: pair in metal foil (PiMF), shielded twisted pair, screened twisted pair, shielded pair. This type of shielding helps prevent EMI from entering or exiting individual pairs and also protects neighboring pairs from crosstalk.

*Overall shield (F/UTP, S/UTP, and SF/UTP): Overall foil, braided shield or braiding with foil across all of the pairs within the 100 ohm twisted pair cable. Common names: foiled twisted pair, shielded twisted pair, screened twisted pair. This type of shielding helps prevent EMI from entering or exiting the cable.

*Individual and overall shield (F/FTP, S/FTP, and SF/FTP): Individual shielding using foils for every twisted pair in a cable, and also an outer foil or braided shielding. Common names: fully shielded twisted pair, screened foiled twisted pair, shielded foiled twisted pair, screened shielded twisted pair, shielded screened twisted pair. This type of shielding helps prevent EMI from entering or exiting the cable and also protects neighboring pairs from crosstalk.

An early example of shielded twisted-pair was IBM STP-A, which is a two-pair 150 ohm S/FTP cable defined in 1985 by the IBM Cabling System specifications, and used with Token Ring or FDDI networks.

==Types==
===Analog telephone===
Before digital communication and Ethernet became widespread there was no international standard for telephone cable. Standards were set at a national level. For instance, in the UK the General Post Office specified CW1293 and CW1308 cables. CW1308 was a similar specification to the earlier CW1293 but with an improved color code. CW1293 used mostly solid colors on the cores making it difficult to identify the pair it was twisted with without stripping back a large amount of sheath. To solve this problem. CW1308 has narrow rings of the paired color printed over the base color. Both cables are a similar standard to category 3 cable. Cables with categories 3 through 7 have 4 twisted pairs.

Prior to the common use of polyethylene and other plastics for insulation, telephone twisted pair cable was insulated with waxed paper or cotton with a wax coating applied to the copper. The overall sheath of this type of cable was usually lead. This style of cable came into use in the late 19th century shortly after the invention of the telephone. The cable termination in termination boxes were sealed with molten wax or a resin to prevent the ingress of moisture which would seriously degrade the insulating properties of the paper insulation. However, such seals made future maintenance and changes more difficult. These cables are no longer made but are still occasionally encountered in old buildings and in various external areas, commonly rural villages.

===Building infrastructure===
===Loaded===
A loaded twisted pair has intentionally added inductance and was formerly common practice on telecommunication lines. The added inductors are known as load coils and reduce attenuation for voiceband frequencies but increase it on higher frequencies. Load coils reduce distortion in voiceband on very long lines. In this context a line without load coils is referred to as an unloaded line.

===Bonded===
A bonded twisted pair is a construction variant in which the two wires of each pair are bonded together for the length of the cable. Pioneered by Belden, it is intended to help assure configuration consistency during and after installation. One key benefit is that the noise immunity performance of the cable can be protected despite potentially rough handling. The enhanced performance may be unnecessary and bonding reduces the flexibility of the cable and makes it prone to failure where it is flexed.

===Twisted ribbon cable===
A twisted ribbon cable is a variant of standard ribbon cable in which adjacent pairs of conductors are bonded and twisted together. The twisted pairs are then lightly bonded to each other in a ribbon format. Periodically along the ribbon, there are short sections with no twisting where connectors may be attached using the usual ribbon cable IDC techniques.

===Solid-core vs. stranded cable===
A solid-core cable uses one solid wire per conductor and in a four-pair cable, there would be a total of eight solid wires. Stranded cable uses multiple wires wrapped around each other in each conductor and in a four-pair with seven strands per conductor cable, there would be a total of 56 wires (2 per pair × 4 pairs × 7 strands).

Solid core cable is intended for permanently installed runs (permanent link). It is less flexible than stranded cable and is more prone to failure if repeatedly flexed due to work hardening. Stranded cable is used at patch panels and for connections from wall ports to end devices (patch cord or drop cable), as it resists cracking of the conductors.

Connectors are designed differently for solid core than for stranded. Use of a connector with the wrong cable type can lead to unreliable cabling. Plugs designed for solid and stranded cores are readily available, and some vendors even offer plugs designed for use with both types. The punch-down blocks on patch-panel and wall-port jacks are designed for use with solid core cable. These work via the insulation-displacement method, whereby the device pierces the sides of the insulation and &quot;bites&quot; into the copper conductor to form a connection. Punchdown blocks are used as patch panels or as break-out boxes, for twisted pair cable.

==Properties==
Twisted pair has the following useful attributes:
* Electrical noise going into or coming from the cable can be prevented.
* Crosstalk is minimized.
* Cheapest form of cable available for networking purposes.
* Easy to handle and install.

Twisted pair has the following limitations:
* Deformation: twisted pair&#x27;s susceptibility to electromagnetic interference greatly depends on the pair twisting schemes staying intact during the installation. As a result, twisted pair cables usually have stringent requirements for maximum pulling tension as well as minimum bend radius. This fragility of twisted-pair cables makes the installation practices an important part of ensuring the cable&#x27;s performance.
* Delay skew: due to different twist rates used to minimize crosstalk between the pairs, different pairs within the cable have different lengths and thus different delays. This can degrade image quality when multiple pairs are used to carry components of a video signal. Low skew cable is available to mitigate this problem.
* Imbalance (see balanced line): differences between the two wires in a pair can cause coupling between the common mode and the differential mode. Line differential to common mode conversion produces common-mode currents that can cause external interference and can produce common-mode signals in other pairs. Common mode to differential mode conversion can produce differential mode signals from common-mode interference from other pairs or external sources. Imbalance can be caused by asymmetry between the two conductors of the pair from each other and in relationship to other wires and the shield. Some sources of asymmetry may result from differences in the conductor diameter and insulation thickness.

<text>The Bishop&#x27;s Wife (also known as Cary and the Bishop&#x27;s Wife) is a 1947 American Christmas romantic fantasy comedy film directed by Henry Koster, starring Cary Grant, Loretta Young and David Niven. The plot is about an angel who helps a bishop with his problems. The film was adapted by Leonardo Bercovici and Robert E. Sherwood from the 1928 novel of the same name by Robert Nathan.

It was remade in 1996 as &quot;The Preacher&#x27;s Wife&quot; starring Denzel Washington, Whitney Houston, and Courtney B. Vance.

==Plot==
Bishop Henry Brougham, having difficulties funding the building of a new cathedral, prays for divine guidance. His plea is seemingly answered by a suave angel named Dudley, who reveals his identity only to the clergyman.

Dudley&#x27;s mission turns out, however, not to be to help construct a cathedral, but to guide Henry and the people around him spiritually. Henry has become obsessed with raising funds, to the detriment of his family life. His relationships with wife Julia and their young daughter Debby are strained by his focus on the cathedral.

Everyone, except for Henry, is charmed by Dudley, even the non-religious Professor Wutheridge. When Dudley spends time cheering up Julia, though, an unexpected development occurs: he finds himself strongly attracted to her. Sensing this, Henry becomes jealous and anxious for his now unwelcome guest to finish and depart. He reveals Dudley&#x27;s true identity to Professor Wutheridge, who urges him to stand up and fight for the woman he loves.

Dudley persuades a wealthy parishioner, the widowed Agnes Hamilton, to contribute her much needed funds, but not to build the cathedral as Henry had hoped. Instead, he coaxes Mrs. Hamilton to donate her money to feed and clothe the needy, much to Henry&#x27;s chagrin.

On several occasions throughout the film, Dudley reveals himself to viewers as an angel. He helps Julia and Sylvester (a taxi driver) ice skate like pros, redecorates the Broughams&#x27; Christmas tree in a few seconds, saves an old church by restoring interest in the boys&#x27; choir, dictates to a typewriter to magically produce Henry&#x27;s new sermon—without Henry&#x27;s knowledge—among other smaller things.

As the climax to the movie approaches, Dudley hints to Julia his desire to stay with her and not move on to his next assignment. Although Julia doesn&#x27;t fully understand what he&#x27;s talking about, she senses what he means and tells him it is time for him to leave. Dudley tells the bishop it is rare for an angel to envy a mortal. When Henry wants to know why his cathedral plans were derailed, Dudley reminds the Bishop that he had prayed for guidance, not a building.

With his mission completed and knowing that Julia loves her husband, Dudley leaves, promising never to return. All memory of him is erased, and later that Christmas Eve at midnight, Henry delivers the sermon he believes he has written. Dudley observes from the street, satisfied that his work is done.

==Cast==
Niven was originally cast as the angel, Dana Andrews as the bishop, and Teresa Wright as his wife. However, Wright had to bow out due to pregnancy. According to Robert Osborne, Andrews was lent to RKO in order to obtain Loretta Young. Koster then brought in Cary Grant, but he wanted to play the angel, so the role of the bishop was given to Niven.

==Production==


The film&#x27;s production faced several difficulties. Producer Samuel Goldwyn replaced director William A. Seiter with Henry Koster to create a completely new film. In early previews, audiences disliked the film, so Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett made uncredited rewrites. Though the premiere of &quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Wife&quot; was acclaimed by critics as a success, the film did not initially perform well at the box office. Market research showed that moviegoers avoided the film because they thought it was religious. As a result, Goldwyn decided to retitle it &quot;Cary and the Bishop&#x27;s Wife&quot; for certain US markets, while adding a black text box with the question &quot;Have you heard about CARY AND THE BISHOP&#x27;S WIFE?&quot; on posters in markets where the film kept the original title. By adding Grant&#x27;s first name to the title, the film&#x27;s business increased by as much as 25 percent.

Location filming was in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In the scene in which Dudley conducts the boys&#x27; choir, the Charles Gounod composition &#x27;Noël: Montez à Dieu&#x27; (&#x27;O Sing to God&#x27;) was performed by the Robert Mitchell Boys Choir. Emil Newman and Herbert W. Spencer&#x27;s melody, &quot;Lost April,&quot; was given lyrics by Eddie DeLange and recorded by Nat King Cole.

==Release==
The film was the second to be chosen for a Royal Command Performance and premiered at the Odeon cinema in London on November 25, 1947. Its American premiere was at the Astor Theatre in New York City.

==Reception==
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Wife&quot; holds an approval rating of based on reviews. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Wife&quot; succeeds thanks to the strength of winning performances from a stellar cast, which includes Cary Grant and Loretta Young.&quot;

==Awards and nominations==
==Adaptations to other media==
&quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Wife&quot; was dramatized as a half-hour radio play on the March 1, 1948, broadcast of &quot;The Screen Guild Theater&quot; with Cary Grant, Loretta Young and David Niven in their original film roles. It was also presented on &quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot; three times as an hour-long broadcast: first on December 19, 1949, with Tyrone Power and David Niven, second on May 11, 1953, with Cary Grant and Phyllis Thaxter and third on March 1, 1955, again with Grant and Thaxter.

The soundtrack has been released on compact disc.

The 1996 film &quot;The Preacher&#x27;s Wife&quot; was a remake based on &quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Wife&quot;.

<text>In Greek mythology, the Horae (), Horai () or Hours (, ) were the goddesses of the seasons and the natural portions of time.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;hora&quot; comes from the Proto-Indo-European (&quot;year&quot;).

== Function ==
The Horae were originally the personifications of nature in its different seasonal aspects, but in later times they were regarded as goddesses of order in general and natural justice. &quot;They bring and bestow ripeness, they come and go in accordance with the firm law of the periodicities of nature and of life&quot;, Karl Kerenyi observed, adding &quot;&quot;Hora&quot; means &#x27;the correct moment&#x27;.&quot; Traditionally, they guarded the gates of Olympus, promoted the fertility of the earth, and rallied the stars and constellations. 

The course of the seasons was also symbolically described as the dance of the Horae, and they were accordingly given the attributes of spring flowers, fragrance and graceful freshness; for example, in Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Works and Days&quot;, the fair-haired &quot;Horai&quot;, together with the Charites and Peitho crown Pandora — she of &quot;all gifts&quot; — with garlands of flowers. Similarly Aphrodite, emerging from the sea and coming ashore at Cyprus, is dressed and adorned by the &quot;Horai&quot;, and, according to a surviving fragment of the epic &quot;Cypria&quot;, Aphrodite wore clothing made for her by the Charites and Horai, dyed with spring flowers, such as the &quot;Horai&quot; themselves wear.

== Names and numbers ==
The number of Horae varied according to different sources, but was most commonly three: either the trio of , , and (goddesses of the order of nature), or Eunomia (goddess of good order), Dike (goddess of Justice) and Eirene (goddess of Peace).

===The earlier Argive Horae===
In Argos, two Horae, rather than three, were recognised, presumably winter and summer: Auxesia (possibly another name for Auxo) and Damia (possibly another name for Carpo).

In late euhemerist interpretations, they were seen as Cretan maidens who were worshipped as goddesses after they had been wrongfully stoned to death.

=== The classical Horae triads ===
The earliest written mention of &quot;Horai&quot; is in the &quot;Iliad&quot; where they appear as keepers of Zeus&#x27;s cloud gates. &quot;Hardly any traces of that function are found in the subsequent tradition,&quot; Karl Galinsky remarked in passing. They were daughters of Zeus and Themis, half-sisters to the Moirai.

The Horai are mentioned in two aspects in Hesiod and the Homeric Hymns:
* in one variant emphasizing their fruitful aspect, Thallo, Auxo, and Carpo —the goddesses of the three seasons the Greeks recognized: spring, summer and autumn— were worshipped primarily amongst rural farmers throughout Greece;
* in the other variant, emphasizing the &quot;right order&quot; aspect of the Horai, Hesiod says that Zeus wedded &quot;bright Themis&quot; who bore Dike, Eunomia, and Eirene, who were law-and-order goddesses that maintained the stability of society; they were worshipped primarily in the cities of Athens, Argos, and Olympia.

==== First triad ====

Of the first, more familiar, triad associated with Aphrodite and Zeus is their origins as emblems of times of life, growth (and the classical three seasons of year):
* Thallo (Θαλλώ, from θάλλειν (&quot;thallein&quot; &#x27;to sprout, grow&#x27;, esp. fruit trees) or Thalatte was the goddess of spring, buds and blooms, a protector of youth.
* Auxo (Αὐξώ, from αὐξάνειν (&quot;auxanein&quot;, &#x27;to increase&#x27;) or Auxesia was worshipped (alongside Hegemone) in Athens as one of their two Charites, Auxo was the Charis of spring and Hegemone was the Charis of autumn. One of the Horae, and the goddess and personification of the season of summer; she is the protector of vegetation and plants, and growth and fertility.
* Carpo (Καρπώ, from καρπῶν (&quot;karpōn&quot;) &#x27;to bear fruit&#x27;) Carpho, Xarpo or Damia (not to be mistaken with Karpos) was the one who brings food and was in charge of autumn, ripening, and harvesting, as well as guarding the way to Mount Olympus and letting back the clouds surrounding the mountain if one of the gods left. She was an attendant to Persephone, Aphrodite, and Hera, and was also associated with Dionysus, Apollo, and Pan.

At Athens, two Horae: Thallo (the Hora of spring) and Carpo (the Hora of autumn), also appear in rites of Attica noted by Pausanias in the 2nd century AD.

==== Second triad ====

Of the second triad associated to Themis and Zeus for law and order:
* Dike (Δίκη, &quot;Justice&quot;, her Roman equivalent was Iustitia) was the goddess of morality and justice: she ruled over human justice, as her mother Themis ruled over divine justice. The anthropomorphisation of Diké as an ever-young woman dwelling in the cities of men was so ancient and strong that in the 3rd century BCE Aratus in &quot;Phaenomena&quot; 96 asserted that she was born a mortal and that, though Zeus placed her on earth to keep mankind just, he quickly learned this was impossible and placed her next to him on Olympus, as the Greek astronomical/astrological constellation The Maiden.
* Eunomia (Εὐνομία, &quot;Order&quot;, her Roman equivalent was Disciplina) was the goddess of law and legislation. The same or a different goddess may have been a daughter of Hermes and Aphrodite.
* Eirene (Εἰρήνη. &quot;Peace&quot;, her Roman equivalent was Pax) was the personification of peace and wealth, and was depicted in art as a beautiful young woman carrying a cornucopia, scepter, and a torch or rhyton.

==== Third triad ====
The last triad of Horae was identified by Hyginus:
* Pherusa (Substance)
* Euporie (Abundance)
* Orthosie (Prosperity)

=== The Four Seasons ===
Nonnus in his &quot;Dionysiaca&quot; mentions a distinct set of four Horae, the daughters of Helios. Quintus Smyrnaeus also attributes the Horae as the daughters of Helios and Selene, and describes them as the four handmaidens of Hera. The seasons were personified by the ancients, the Greeks represented them generally as women but on some antique monuments they are depicted as winged children with attributes peculiar to each season. The Greek words for the four seasons of year:

==== Modern influence ====
Nicolas Poussin has represented the four seasons by subjects drawn from the Bible: Spring is portrayed by Adam and Eve in paradise: Summer, by Ruth gleaning: Autumn, by Joshua and Caleb bearing grapes from the promised land; and Winter, by the deluge.

In more modern representations the seasons are often surrounding Apollo: Spring, as Flora, crowned with flowers, and in a shaded green drapery over a white robe: Summer, standing under the lion in the zodiac, with a gold-coloured drapery over a white gauze vestment, the edges of which are tinged by the yellow rays of the sun, holding a sickle, having near her a wheat-sheaf; Autumn, as a Bacchante, in a violet-coloured garment, pressing grapes with one band into a golden cup, which she holds in the other; and Winter as an aged person, placed in the shade at a great distance from the god.

=== The Hours ===

Finally, a quite separate suite of Horae personified the twelve hours (originally only ten), as tutelary goddesses of the times of day. The hours run from just before sunrise to just after sunset, thus winter hours are short, summer hours are long:

==== The nine Hours ====
According to Hyginus, the list is only of nine, borrowed from the three classical triads alternated:
==== The twelve Hours ====

A distinct set of ten or twelve Hours is much less known and they are described as daughters of Chronos (Time):
==== The twenty-four Hours ====
The last set of hours of the day and night is allegorically represented in the following:

<text>Eirene or Irene () was an ancient Greek artist described by Pliny the Elder in the 1st century. She was the daughter of a painter, and created an image of a girl that was housed at Eleusis.

One of the five or six female artists of antiquity mentioned in Pliny the Elder&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot; (XL.147-148) in A.D. 77: Timarete, Irene, Aristarete, Iaia, Olympias, and possibly Calypso.

During the Renaissance, Giovanni Boccaccio, a 14th-century humanist, included Eirene in &quot;De mulieribus claris&quot; (Latin for &quot;On Famous Women&quot;). Some of the paintings he credits to Eirene are an older Calypso, the gladiator Theodorus and Alcisthenes, a famous dancer.
